A brush fire in southern Miami-Dade has forced the closure of Card Sound Road, and the wind will play a role in determining where the smoke will move. Rain is not expected to help with the containment of the fire, and it will be mainly dry and sunny in the afternoon with highs in the low 80s. There is a moderate risk of rip currents along the Atlantic beaches. Thursday will be the warmest day of the week, with highs in the mid 80s, but it will be breezy. The weekend will be warmer, with highs in the low 80s, and early next week the chance of rain increases with spotty showers on Monday and scattered showers on Tuesday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:21 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/mostly-sunny-and-dry-across-south-florida/)\n\n**Vilfand Predicts Up to 14 Degrees Celsius in Moscow Next Week**\nRoman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, has predicted that the temperature in Moscow may reach up to 14 degrees Celsius next week. 'The temperature will be above 10 degrees Celsius on March 23 and 24, with daytime temperatures ranging from +6 to +11 degrees Celsius. It will be sunny due to high pressure, and the air masses will be moving from the south,' Vilfand said. He added that on March 25, daytime temperatures are expected to range from +9 to +14 degrees Celsius, with mostly clear skies and little precipitation. 'There will be plenty of sunshine in the coming days, and if you stand outside for an hour, you might even get a sunburn,' Vilfand concluded. This comes after Tatyana Pozdnyakova, the chief specialist at the Moscow Meteorological Bureau, predicted that April will be 3 degrees warmer than normal in Moscow. Vilfand also previously stated that spring 2025 temperatures will be within or slightly below normal, and that the winter of 2024-2025 was the second warmest on record.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1856652/2025-03-19/vilfand-sprognoziroval-do-14-gradusov-tepla-v-moskve-na-sleduiushchei-nedele)\n\n**What will weather be like during Easter school holidays in Scotland as experts tease 'hottest ever' April - Daily Record**\nExperts predict that this April could be the 'hottest ever' in the UK, with a 20% chance of it being the planet's hottest ever April. The Met Office's long-range forecast suggests that it will be dry with average temperatures, but there is a possibility of wetter episodes. Daytime maximum temperatures are expected to be around 11C, but some experts believe it could reach 27 degrees in parts of the UK. However, there is also a 17% chance of it being the UK's wettest ever April. Shane Orton from betideas.com said, 'From June 2023 to June 2024, the globe saw the hottest ever months 13 times in a row - so it's incredibly likely that it will be the same story next month.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 09:47 AM\nSource:[Daily Record](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/what-weather-like-during-easter-34888681)\n\n**Russia's April Weather Forecast: Warmer Than Usual**\nAccording to a forecast by Moscow's meteorological office, temperatures in the Central Federal District (CFO) are expected to be three degrees warmer than usual. As meteorologist Tatyana Pozdnyakova said, 'This means that the average monthly air temperature will exceed 10 degrees Celsius. April 2025 will have a similar air temperature to April 2024.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 07:26 AM\nSource:[RZN.info](https://www.rzn.info/news/2025/3/19/rossiyanam-dali-prognoz-aprelskoj-pogody-v-cfo-313899.html)\n\n**April in Moscow to be Abnormally Warm, Says Meteorologist Tatyana Podynyakova**\nAccording to meteorologist Tatyana Podynyakova, April in Moscow will be abnormally warm, with a mean monthly temperature above +10\u00b0C. 'All seasonal weather forecast models are unanimous in their calculations: a positive temperature anomaly will persist in April, averaging around +3\u00b0C. This means that the mean monthly temperature will exceed +10\u00b0C,' she wrote in her Telegram channel. Podynyakova notes that April this year will be similar to April 2024 in terms of temperature. However, the forecast for precipitation is uncertain, with both a deficit and an excess being equally likely. Last year, April saw an excess of precipitation, with 37 mm of normal precipitation exceeded by 130-150%.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 06:20 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/03/19/reg-cfo/sinoptik-pozdniakova-v-aprele-anomalno-teplaia-pogoda-v-moskve-sohranitsia.html)\n\n**April 2025: Temperatures Above Average, but Extreme Weather Events Possible**\nAccording to the latest updates, April 2025 is expected to start with temperatures above the average, with deviations of +2-3\u00b0C from the reference values on most of Europe's central and eastern regions, as well as Scandinavia. Italy is also expected to experience temperatures above the average, with deviations of +1 to +3\u00b0C from the mean. However, this does not mean that there will be constant sunshine and warm weather. Powerful meridian exchanges are possible, which could bring rapid and significant changes in the weather, including late-season cold fronts and extreme weather events such as violent storms, tornadoes, and heavy rain. The first decade of April is expected to see above-average precipitation in Italy, with the possibility of snow on the mountains. Only in the second part of the month, around Easter (April 20), is there a chance of greater atmospheric stability in Italy, although this will be updated in future articles. The spring season is expected to be extreme, with a succession of unstable and unpredictable weather patterns.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[ILMETEO.it](https://www.ilmeteo.it/notizie/meteo-aprile-sotto-la-pioggia-ecco-la-prima-tendenza-fino-a-pasqua-180002)\n\n**Possible First Summer Day of 2025: Temperatures to Reach Up to 25 Degrees Celsius**\nA meteorologist, Dominik Jung, predicts that it could be the first summer day of the year 2025 on Friday, with temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celsius. According to the German Weather Service (DWD), a summer day is defined as a day with a minimum air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. Jung says that it will be unusually warm for the season, with temperatures in the west and southwest reaching up to 20 degrees Celsius, and locally even warmer. In the east, temperatures will reach up to 21 degrees Celsius, and in the north, up to 18 degrees Celsius. Jung also notes that the sun will shine brightly throughout the country, with 10-12 hours of sunshine per day. However, a high-pressure system called 'Konstantina' will bring Saharan dust to the country, which may cloud the sky in the west on Friday. Despite this, temperatures are expected to remain warm over the weekend, with values of 15-22 degrees Celsius predicted for Saturday and Sunday. Jung notes that it is still unclear how the weather will develop in April and May, and that cold air masses may still occur.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[T-online.de](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/panorama/wetter/id_100641434/wetter-bis-zu-25-grad-diese-woche-erster-sommertag-moeglich.html)\n\n**Unseasonable Heat Wave to Hit Leningrad Region in April**\nA synoptician has predicted that April 2025 in the Leningrad region will bring an unusual heat wave, with daytime temperatures reaching +20 degrees Celsius from the beginning of the month and potentially exceeding +25 degrees Celsius by the second half of the month. This will lead to an early awakening of nature and infrastructure in the region. While the early warmth brings pleasant prospects, it may also have negative consequences, such as early tree blooming, which can cause problems for people with allergies, and an increase in forest fires due to dry soil. However, for gardeners, this will be a welcome gift, as the long-awaited dacha season will start much earlier. For people with weather-related health issues, the rapid temperature fluctuations may pose a significant challenge. As a result, it is essential to be prepared for the unusual consequences of this early summer. This spring once again highlights the global climate changes that have affected even our familiar weather patterns.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 05:31 PM\nSource:[ngzt.ru](https://ngzt.ru/news/anomalnaya-zhara-nagryanet-v-aprele-leto-nastupit-na-dva-mesyaca-ranshe-rasskazal-sinoptik/)\n\n**Spring Weather Forecast: Sunny and Warm, with Occasional Rain Showers**\nThe upcoming days will bring the beginning of spring, with temperatures expected to rise to 15 degrees Celsius.

The NWS warns of a new wave of extreme weather conditions, including thunderstorms and heavy snowfall in the western and northern parts of the country. In contrast, the central and eastern regions will experience unusually high temperatures. However, this warm weather will be accompanied by the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Additionally, a high risk of wildfires is forecasted in the central and southern high plains due to strong winds, low humidity, and dry vegetation. The eastern and southeastern regions will experience relatively stable conditions, with scattered rain showers and light snowfall.

The hottest month in Miami is August, with temperatures reaching up to 87.3\u00b0F (30.7\u00b0C), while the coldest month is January, with temperatures ranging from 61.0\u00b0F (16.1\u00b0C).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[La Opini\u00f3n Digital](https://laopinion.com/2025/01/25/miami-el-tiempo-para-hoy-sabado-25-de-enero/)\n\n**You think it's cold now? Here's how much colder it will get in Miami and across Florida**\nA cold front has moved through South Florida, plunging temperatures into the weekend. The National Weather Service in Miami predicts wind chills ranging from the 30s in parts of the interior and Southwest Florida to low- to mid-40s along the east coast. Patchy frost may develop across interior locations west of Lake Okeechobee Friday and Saturday mornings, with temperatures in that region reaching low- to mid-30s. Temperatures in the Miami area will see highs only reaching the mid-60s Thursday, around 60 on Friday, and 69 on Saturday. The cold weather will resume on Sunday and Monday, with highs reaching low- to mid-70s. Robert Molleda, the National Weather Service in Miami's weather coordination meteorologist, warns of a high risk of rip currents along Atlantic Beaches through the weekend and hazardous marine conditions through Saturday. Weather Underground predicts the coldest temperatures to be in Fort Lauderdale (47\u00b0F with a 'feels-like' low of 43) and Gainesville (29\u00b0F with a 'feels-like' low of 29) on Saturday morning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 07:34 PM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/knowledge/weather/weathernews/s-3569721)\n\n**A cold and 'dreary' week is in store for South Florida as winter presses on**\nA cool and 'dreary' week is expected for South Florida, with temperatures ranging from the mid-70s to the mid-40s. According to George Rizzuto, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service of Miami, scattered showers are expected until Wednesday, followed by a cold front that will drop high temperatures to the upper 60s and low 70s. The coldest temperatures are expected late Friday night and Saturday morning, with some areas seeing temperatures in the mid-40s. Rizzuto notes that it's possible to still get strong cold fronts through the rest of the winter, particularly in January and February. 'Cloud coverage will allow for mild high temperatures, with many locations struggling to reach 70 degrees,' the NWS Miami forecast states. If Friday sees highs only in the 60s, it would be the coolest high temperatures the region has seen so far this year, Rizzuto said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[SunSentinel](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/01/21/a-cold-and-dreary-week-is-in-store-for-south-florida-as-winter-presses-on/)\n\n**A weather roller coaster\": Miami temperatures to bounce around warm to cold this week**\nSouth Florida can expect a 'weather roller coaster' this week, with temperatures fluctuating from warm to cold. According to Sammy Hadi, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Miami office, 'it is going to be a week that starts off wet with showers at times, then with two cold fronts Wednesday and Friday night.' Temperatures are projected to be in the mid to upper 70s on Tuesday, but will drop to the upper 60s on Wednesday and Thursday, and could be in the upper 50s on Friday morning and the middle 60s during the daytime. Residents should remain vigilant, as temperatures on Saturday morning are likely to be in the upper 40s. While it may snow in cities further north in the state, South Florida residents should still be prepared for a cold Friday and Saturday morning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 09:34 PM\nSource:[Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/article298855963.html)\n\n**Miami Weather Forecast for Sunday, January 19**\nAccording to the weather forecast for Miami, Florida, on Sunday, January 19, the temperature is expected to reach a maximum of 82\u00b0F (28\u00b0C) with a 3% chance of rain.
