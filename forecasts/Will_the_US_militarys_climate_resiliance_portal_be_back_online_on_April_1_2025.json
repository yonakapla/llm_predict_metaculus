However, national security experts argue that the Pentagon's climate change efforts are actually focused on warfare and not purely environmental purposes. Tom Ellison of the Center for Climate and Security notes that climate change will impact the military's ability to operate, including extreme heat and pollution affecting troop health, changes in ocean chemistry affecting submarine sonar, and changes in humidity affecting aircraft lift capacity. The military is also building resilience into its infrastructure planning, with some installations expected to be abandoned due to rising sea levels. Despite bipartisan support for the military's climate change efforts, the Defense Department has taken down its official climate resilience portal and has not responded to questions about which climate-related programs will be eliminated.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 10:06 AM\nSource:[whro.org](https://www.whro.org/military-veterans/2025-02-26/among-the-trump-administrations-first-pentagon-cuts-programs-that-respond-to-climate-change)\n\n**Ukrainian Government Extends Deadline for Military Reservists**\nThe Ukrainian government has extended the deadline for military reservists to postpone their conscription until the end of March. According to Taras Melnychuk, the government's representative in the parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers has made changes to the resolution of the CMU #1332 of November 22, 2023, 'Some issues related to the booking of military reservists during mobilization and wartime'. Melnychuk wrote, 'It has been established that the postponements of conscription during mobilization, which were granted to military reservists by decisions of the Ministry of Economy or through the 'Diia' portal and whose validity period has not expired on the day of the adoption of these changes, are valid until March 31, 2025.' The government has also made changes to the resolution of the CMU #36 of January 14, allowing companies to re-book their employees through the 'Diia' portal without a 72-hour verification period until April 1. As Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said, 'Companies will have time to confirm their status as critical and to re-book their personnel. Due to the large-scale Russian cyberattack on our registers, some time was lost, and we are giving them the opportunity to make up for it.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 04:35 PM\nSource:[gordonua.com](https://gordonua.com/ukr/news/politics/kabmin-ukrajini-prodovzhiv-diju-vidstrochok-zabronovanikh-vijskovozobovjazanikh-pratsivnikiv-1734682.html)\n\n**EPA unfreezes some climate grants**\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has unfrozen its climate grants, with the exception of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is still frozen. Awardees of other EPA grant programs under the 2022 climate law reported being able to access the federal government's portal to receive funds, after being frozen since January 28. The EPA had stated that the pause was for a 'review' of the programs. Notably, two of the three programs under the $27 billion GGRF were untouched by the freeze, as the funds were held in accounts at Citibank with the recipients' names on them.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 09:42 PM\nSource:[E&E News](https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-unfreezes-some-climate-grants/)\n\n**Military Health System Beneficiaries Urged to Download Old Medical Records by April 1**\nThe Department of Defense is urging military health system beneficiaries to download their old medical records by April 1, as the Tricare Online Patient Portal will be decommissioned. Rear Adm. Tracy Farrill, a DHA electronic health records expert, said, 'All military hospitals and clinics have transitioned to MHS Genesis. We encourage you to take these important steps to save your personal health records before the [Tricare Online] Patient Portal decommissions.' Patients can download their records by signing in to www.tricareonline.com and following the instructions. However, legacy records may not be complete, and new MHS Genesis records do not contain information from previous electronic and paper health records. Providers still have access to those records to treat patients. The Defense Department has transitioned to MHS Genesis, which is now used at 138 military hospitals and clinics and more than 3,600 DoD locations worldwide.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 10:40 PM\nSource:[Military](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/18/military-health-system-beneficiaries-urged-download-old-medical-records-april-1.html)\n\n**Sec. Hegseth: DOD Climate Programs Ripe For Cuts, Military Should Focus On War-Fighting**\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has suggested cutting Department of Defense (DOD) climate change programs to reduce spending, stating, 'The Defense Department is not in the business of climate change, solving the global thermostat. We\u2019re in the business of deterring and winning wars.' Hegseth believes the Biden administration 'underinvested' in the military, but wants to increase the defense budget. However, the Biden administration has framed climate change as a military priority, with efforts including net-zero installations and leveraging renewable energy technologies. The 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan outlines the military's mitigation goals, including enhancing resilience through renewable energy and microgrids. The proposed defense budget for 2023 included $3.7 billion for 'installation resiliency and adaptation' and $1.5 billion for research and development, operational energy, and contingency preparedness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[climatechangedispatch.com](https://climatechangedispatch.com/sec-hegseth-dod-climate-programs-ripe-for-cuts-military-should-focus-on-war-fighting/)\n\n**Brazil Establishes National Day for Climate Action**\nThe Brazilian Chamber of Deputies has approved a bill that establishes April 27th as the National Day for Climate Action. The bill, proposed by Deputy Duda Salabert, aims to promote climate action and disaster preparedness among schools. According to Salabert, the date was chosen because it marks the beginning of the heavy rains in Rio Grande do Sul in 2024. 'The proposal is also a way to remember the lives lost due to human inaction regarding climate change across the country,' she said. The bill requires schools to develop activities focused on prevention, reduction, protection, and response to extreme weather events and natural disasters. These activities will include training, exercises, and practical actions such as creating emergency evacuation routes, conducting environmental education, and preparing emergency kits.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 11:15 PM\nSource:[Portal da C\u00e2mara dos Deputados](https://www.camara.leg.br/noticias/1133050-camara-aprova-projeto-que-cria-o-dia-nacional-para-a-acao-climatica/)\n\n**First Up: Modi in Paris for AI Summit, Aero India 2025 in Bengaluru... The headlines today**\nToday's headlines cover global diplomacy, defense, legal battles, and environmental commitments. Prime Minister Narendra Modi co-chairs the AI Action Summit in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron, focusing on ethical AI governance. Meanwhile, Aero India 2025 kicks off in Bengaluru, showcasing cutting-edge aerospace technology. In the UK, farmers protest outside Parliament over agricultural policies, while key legal hearings unfold in India, including a case against Sonia Gandhi and petitions on Rohingya settlements. The deadline for countries to submit updated climate action plans under the Paris Agreement arrives, marking a crucial moment in global environmental policy. As Macron said, 'This significant event aims to establish global standards for ethical and sustainable AI development.' Notable attendees include US Vice President JD Vance, China's Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, and leaders from major tech companies like Alphabet and Microsoft. The summit will address issues such as labour disruption, environmental sustainability, and the equitable distribution of AI benefits. The 15th edition of Aero India, Asia's premier aerospace and defence exhibition, begins today at Yelahanka Air Force Station in Bengaluru, running from February 10 to 14, 2025. The event showcases advanced military and civil aviation technology, featuring aerial displays, exhibitions, and seminars. Industry leaders, defence experts, and aviation enthusiasts from around the globe are in attendance. The exhibition provides a platform for collaboration and business opportunities in the aerospace sector, highlighting India's growing capabilities in defence production and aviation technology. In London, farmers have organised a tractor protest outside the UK Parliament, voicing concerns over agricultural policies and their impact on the farming community. The demonstration aims to draw attention to issues such as fair pricing, subsidies, and environmental regulations affecting the agricultural sector. The Supreme Court of India is set to hear a batch of pleas challenging the Calcutta High Court's April 22 decision regarding irregularities in school recruitment processes in West Bengal. The petitions question the legality of the recruitment procedures and seek redressal for affected candidates. Today marks the deadline for countries to submit their updated national climate action plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), under the Paris Agreement. These plans outline each country's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, contributing to global climate goals. As the article states, 'The timely submission of NDCs is crucial for assessing global progress in combating climate change and ensuring that collective efforts are aligned with the targets set in the Paris Agreement.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 01:58 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/first-up-modi-in-paris-for-ai-summit-aero-india-2025-in-bengaluru-the-headlines-today-13861126.html)\n\n**Trump and Project 2025: President's early moves mirror conservative playbook - National | Globalnews.ca**\nDonald Trump's early executive orders in his second term align with many ideas promoted in Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda published by the Heritage Foundation in April 2023. Over 30 of Trump's 47 early executive orders show clear parallels with Project 2025, including ending certain international agreements, loosening environmental regulations, and scaling back on or dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump has repeatedly denied any involvement with Project 2025, but experts say it's likely that his team has searched for recommendations that align with his policies. Project 2025 proposed a freeze on 'all top career-position hiring' to 'prevent 'burrowing in' by outgoing political appointees,' which Trump's White House has ordered. The blueprint also recommended that Health and Human Services cancel programs that recognize transgender people and that the government withdraw all guidance to teens seeking 'gender-affirming care' or 'gender transition.' Trump has taken steps to implement these recommendations, including ending federal funding for gender-affirming care for minors and rescinding protections for transgender Americans to serve in the military. Project 2025 proposed ending programs designed to meet the Paris climate agreement, with the goal of ceasing a 'global, climate-themed agenda' and the 'perceived threat of climate change.' Trump's White House has started the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, including financial commitments and related agreements. 'Trump is, if nothing else, predictable. He'll do what makes him look like a winner and implementing the sweeping programs in Project 2025 is an easy pathway to looking like a winner,' said Aaron Ettinger, Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Carleton University.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 06:22 PM\nSource:[Global News](https://globalnews.ca/news/10989366/donald-trump-project-2025-executive-orders-comparison/)\n\n**Medicaid portal freeze sparks nationwide confusion with users in all 50 states locked out of accounts**\nThe Medicaid benefits portal went dark nationwide, leaving recipients confused and without access to their accounts. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt assured that no payments have been affected and that the portal will be back online shortly. Leavitt defended President Trump's plan to audit spending and cut progressive programs, saying the administration wants to be 'good stewards' of taxpayer money. Trump has also promised to release classified documents related to the assassinations of President John F Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King. Additionally, he has vowed to reinstate a ban on transgender military service and ban transgender women from competing in women's sports. Trump has also promised to overturn President Biden's climate policies and visit Los Angeles in the wake of recent devastating wildfires.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 07:45 PM\nSource:[the-sun.com](https://www.the-sun.com/news/13401667/medicaid-down-portal-freeze-donald-trump-spending-cut/)\n\n**Putin Signs Decree on Call-up of Citizens in Reserve for Military Training in 2025**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to call up citizens in reserve for military training in 2025. According to the decree, published on the official portal of legal information, citizens in reserve will be called up for military training in the Armed Forces, National Guard, rescue units, state security, and federal security. The decree comes into effect on the day of publication. The government and regional authorities are tasked with ensuring the implementation of all measures related to the conduct of these training sessions. The training is aimed at improving combat readiness and is a planned annual event. Reservists can receive summons every three years in both paper and electronic form. The maximum duration of training is two months. Typically, the call-up of those in reserve occurs once a year. In 2023, Putin signed a decree on the call-up for military training on May 10, and in 2024, on March 1. As a reminder, the Russian Ministry of Defense also announced the end of the autumn conscription for military service on December 28. A total of 133,000 people were called up for military service, with the dispatch of conscripts from collection points beginning on October 15. The next, spring, conscription campaign will begin on April 1 and end on July 15. It is worth noting that significant amendments to the law 'On Military Obligation and Military Service' were adopted in the spring of 2023. At the same time, it was reported that the accounting of military personnel would be carried out automatically, and summons would be sent through 'Gosuslugi.' In December 2024, Putin instructed the Ministry of Defense to conduct the autumn conscription using the electronic register of military personnel and the register of summons. Head of the Defense Committee of the State Duma Andrei Kartapolov said that the previous autumn conscription was based on paper summons. According to him, electronic summons are currently being tested in three regions - the Riazan region, Mari El, and Sakhalin.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 16, 2025 05:57 PM\nSource:[\u0411\u0418\u0417\u041d\u0415\u0421 Online \u2014 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438, \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438, \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044b](https://www.business-gazeta.ru/news/660140)\n\n**Overseas military pharmacies are moving to interactive phone-in refills**\nU.S. military pharmacies overseas are transitioning to an interactive, voice-response system for prescription refills, with the goal of completing the transition by June 2025. According to DHA spokesman Peter Graves, the new system is about 78% complete, with most military treatment facilities having already updated their pharmacy labels and websites with their new phone number. Patients can still refill prescriptions using the MHS Genesis Patient Portal online, and the transition will not affect existing prescriptions or refills. Some patients are hopeful that the new system will be an improvement, as it may be easier to use than the previous online system. As Graves said, 'The digital refill call system is already active, and we are working towards new capabilities that are being piloted by Edwards [Air Force Base], to include refill pickup notifications.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 16, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[stripes.com](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/asia_pacific/2025-01-16/prescription-refills-military-pharmacies-16499011.html)\n\n**Government's 'Clean Air' Program to Resume in 2025 with Reforms**\nThe government's 'Clean Air' program will be reinstated on April 1, 2025, according to Minister of Climate and Environment Paulina Hennig-Kloska. She stated that after consulting with the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, she set a deadline for the program's return. Changes will be made, focusing on the way controls and subsidies are administered. The National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management suspended new applications to the program in late November, citing the need for reform and system tightening. In December, the Fund reported that it had filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office regarding several companies suspected of committing crimes under the program, with disputed contracts totaling approximately 600 million z\u0142.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 10:19 AM\nSource:[www.money.pl](https://www.money.pl/gospodarka/oto-termin-powrotu-rzadowego-programu-beda-kontrole-wkroczy-skarbowka-7112709778238176a.html)\n\n**2025 Bedelli Askerlik Yerleri Ne Zaman A\u00e7\u0131klanacak?**\nFollowing the announcement by the Turkish Ministry of National Defense that applications for voluntary military service would begin on January 7, 2025, attention has turned to the online portal for inquiring about the locations for this service.

Initially, probabilities ranged mostly around 30%-50%, with some optimism from technical capabilities and pressure from stakeholders. However, after considering recent developments such as budget cuts and the administration's continued stance against climate initiatives, most experts revised their probabilities downwards. The final revised probabilities mostly fall between 25% to 45%, reflecting a reduced likelihood due to political and budgetary constraints under the current administration.",
