According to Eric Nicholl, the auto show's executive director, 'The Vancouver Auto Show\u2019s primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff.' This decision comes after Tesla was provided multiple opportunities to withdraw, but declined each time. The auto show, which runs from March 19 to 23, is described as 'Western Canada's premiere automotive experience and B.C. 's best attended consumer show.' This move follows recent controversies surrounding Tesla products and CEO Elon Musk, including the U.S. Department of Justice charging individuals and BC Hydro making Tesla products ineligible for its electric vehicle charger rebate program.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 06:43 PM\nSource:[keremeosreview.com](https://www.keremeosreview.com/news/tesla-removed-from-vancouver-international-auto-show-for-safety-concerns-7891631)\n\n**Vancouver International Auto Show removes Tesla, citing safety concerns at event**\nTesla has been removed from participating in the Vancouver International Auto Show due to safety concerns, according to the event's executive director, Eric Nicholl. Nicholl stated that the show asked Tesla to withdraw voluntarily, citing a 'primary concern' for the safety of workers, attendees, and exhibitors. This decision comes after protests over the weekend, including in Ottawa and Vancouver, that denounced Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his role advising U.S. President Donald Trump. Pat McCutcheon, who attended one of the protests, said that the organizers of the auto show made the right decision, as there was a 'fair amount of emotion' surrounding Tesla. McCutcheon is organizing a protest outside a Langley, British Columbia Tesla dealership this weekend, stating that Elon Musk is using his wealth to 'corrupt democracy' and that citizens need to 'push back' on this. The removal of Tesla from the auto show also follows British Columbia Hydro's decision to ban Tesla products from its electric vehicle rebate program, as part of the provincial government's move to give preference to Canadian goods and exclude U.S. ones from rebates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 05:37 PM\nSource:[sun-sentinel.com](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/03/19/canada-tesla/)\n\n**Never wait to charge again: The benefits of a home EV charger**\nAs electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, homeowners and strata councils in North Vancouver are installing home EV chargers for convenience and cost savings. According to TCA Electric, having a dedicated home charger is a 'game-changer' for most EV owners, as it eliminates the need to plan around public chargers and reduces costs. The installation process typically takes a day for single-family homes and a few hours if no service upgrade is needed. TCA Electric expertly handles EV charger installations for multifamily buildings and offers a dedicated project manager to oversee the process. Homeowners can save on costs with BC Hydro's rebates of up to $350 for eligible home EV chargers. TCA Electric, with over 15 years of experience in electrical contracting, specializes in EV charger installations and aims to make the process 'seamless' for clients. Their team assesses power capacity, navigates permits, and secures rebates to deliver top-tier service. As the push toward electrification accelerates, future-proofing EV infrastructure is essential, and working with an expert like TCA Electric ensures a smooth process.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[nsnews.com](https://www.nsnews.com/sponsored/never-wait-to-charge-again-the-benefits-of-a-home-ev-charger-10386339)\n\n**Tesla Exits 2025 Vancouver Auto Show Over Safety Concerns**\nTesla has withdrawn from the 2025 Vancouver Auto Show due to 'primary concerns' about the safety of workers, attendees, and exhibitors.

Additionally, British Columbia Hydro has excluded Tesla products from its electric vehicle rebate program, favoring Canadian-made goods in the ongoing Canada-U.S. trade dispute.

According to executive director Eric Nicholl, 'The Vancouver Auto Show's primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff.' This decision comes amid protests against Tesla in Canada, which have been sparked by owner Elon Musk's ties to U.S. President Donald Trump and the ongoing trade war between the two countries. Tesla's products have been excluded from B.C.'s electric vehicle rebate programs, and its electric vehicle charging stations have also been removed from the rebate programs. The auto show, which attracts over 100,000 attendees, will provide an update on Tesla's removal at 5:30 p.m. PT.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 11:57 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/vancouver-international-auto-show-removes-235730545.html)\n\n**Tesla excluded from incentives in Canada over Trump tariffs**\nTesla has been excluded from two Canadian EV incentive programs due to the company's ties with the Trump administration. Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow announced that the city would no longer provide tax incentives for Tesla vehicles for ride-hailing and taxi purposes, while British Columbia (B.C.) Premier David Eby removed Tesla from the B.C. Hydro EV charging rebate program. 'We are giving incentives for people to migrate into electric cars, except we will stop giving incentives, financial incentives to buy Tesla,' Chow said. 'We have certainly said that if you want to buy Tesla, go ahead, but don't count on taxpayer money to subsidize it.' B.C. Energy Minister Adrian Dix also stated that he thought Tesla products 'shouldn't be made available on a public subsidy program right now.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:21 PM\nSource:[TESLARATI](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-excluded-incentives-canada-trump-tariffs/)\n\n**Tesla Products To Be Deprived Of Rebates In Canadian Province Amid US-Canada Trade Tensions - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)**\nTesla's electric vehicle charging stations and home batteries have been excluded from rebates in the Canadian province of British Columbia. This decision comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Canada. According to BC Hydro, the exclusion is due to the fact that Tesla products are made in the U.S. and the program prioritizes Canadian goods. However, customers who received pre-approval for Tesla products before March 12 will still be eligible for their rebates. This move is part of a larger trend of backlash against Tesla in Canada, including the province of Ontario terminating a contract with Musk's Starlink and the city of Toronto leaving Tesla out of its driver incentive program.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 03:18 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/25/03/44321211/tesla-charging-stations-cut-from-rebate-program-by-canadian-province-most-people-would-support-their-removal-from-subsidy-list-says-minister)\n\n**Canada excludes Tesla chargers from government EV rebates**\nThe Canadian power provider B.C. Hydro has made Tesla chargers ineligible for EV rebates in British Columbia, citing a desire to include more Canadian goods in its rebate programs. This move comes as a response to Elon Musk's growing political influence, particularly his support of right-wing movements. The decision affects not only Tesla chargers but also the company's energy storage batteries and inverters. Meanwhile, a Canadian parliament member has suggested imposing a 100% tax on all Tesla products if his party comes to power. The move is seen as a backlash against Musk's growing political reach, which has also led to vandalism and protests against Tesla dealerships and charging stations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 12:17 AM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-3634400)\n\n**BC Hydro Removes Tesla Products from EV Rebate Program * iPhone in Canada Blog**\nBC Hydro has removed Tesla products from the province's Electric Vehicle (EV) rebate program, as part of an effort to prioritize Canadian-made goods over products from the United States. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla's electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters are no longer eligible for rebates under the CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. However, if you purchased a Tesla product or received pre-approval before this date, your rebate will still be processed. This move is aimed at supporting local manufacturers and reducing reliance on U.S.-produced goods, according to BC Hydro. The rebate amount for EV chargers is up to 50% of the cost, to a max of $350. BC Hydro stated, 'This change is aimed at aligning rebate programs with the province's goals of supporting Canadian products wherever possible.' The province has also removed U.S. liquor from shelves in BC liquor stores. The tariff wars between Canada and the U.S. continue to escalate, with Canada imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs and China retaliating with tariffs on rapeseed oil, pork, and aquatic products.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 10:21 PM\nSource:[iPhone in Canada Blog](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2025/03/13/bc-hydro-tesla-ev-rebate/)\n\n**British Columbia Announces End to Tesla Subsidies in Trade War with US**\nThe Canadian province of British Columbia has announced that it will no longer provide subsidies for the installation of Tesla charging stations, in an effort to 'punish' Elon Musk, a close associate of Donald Trump. The move comes as part of a broader effort by Canada to reject US products in the midst of a trade war with Trump. According to BC Hydro, the province's electricity company, Tesla charging stations, batteries, and inverters are no longer eligible for rebates as of March 12. The company stated, 'The Government of British Columbia and BC Hydro are taking steps to prioritize Canadian products in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where possible, products manufactured in the United States.' This move is part of a larger effort by Canada to respond to US tariffs with its own measures, including a $21 billion retaliatory tariff package that went into effect on March 13. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said, 'We have to fight against this nonsense,' and added that she will express her discontent to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at a meeting in Quebec. Mark Carney, who will take office as Canadian Prime Minister on March 14, stated that the retaliatory tariffs will not be lifted until Trump commits to 'free and fair trade' with Canada.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 09:04 PM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo/2025/03/13/doug-ford-inspira-a-canadienses-columbia-britanica-anuncia-dura-medida-contra-musk/)\n\n**Tesla rebates axed in B.C. as trade war widens**\nTesla vehicle chargers, batteries, and inverters are no longer eligible for rebates in British Columbia as of March 12, according to a notice on BC Hydro's website.

The program, which offers up to $350 in discounts for home charging station purchases and installations, will no longer include Tesla-branded charging stations, batteries, and inverters, effective March 12. However, customers who purchased a Tesla product or received pre-approval before this date will still be eligible for the discount. BC Hydro aims to prioritize Canadian products and exclude American ones, in line with the government's efforts to promote domestic manufacturing in response to US tariffs. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh had previously suggested imposing stricter restrictions on Tesla, including a 100% tariff on its products if his party comes to power in the next federal election. It is unclear if Tesla products will be excluded from BC Hydro's other discount programs, including a $4000 rebate for eligible residents who purchase or lease a new electric vehicle.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2147678/tesla-exclut-rabais-bc-hydro)\n\n**B.C. government takes action against Tesla amid U.S. tariff tensions**\nThe British Columbia government has taken action against Tesla amid US tariff tensions.
