Boulder recorded a top speed of 84 mph on Monday morning, while Denver reached 56 mph early Wednesday morning. Pinpoint Weather Meteorologist Travis Michels said the wind warnings will end at noon, and the wind will slowly die down Wednesday afternoon and into the sunset hours. Michels noted that the Denver metro area should not be windy heading into Thursday, but the Eastern Plains will still see strong winds through the end of the week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 07:22 PM\nSource:[FOX21 News](https://www.fox21news.com/news/these-colorado-areas-saw-80-mph-wind-gusts-after-a-breezy-start-to-the-week/)\n\n**2024: The First Year to Exceed 1.5 Degrees Celsius Above Pre-Industrial Levels**\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2024 was the first year that the Earth's average temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This marks the first time the '1.5 degree' threshold, set as a target to mitigate the effects of climate change, has been surpassed. However, the long-term trend shows that the Earth's temperature increase is still within the 1.5 degree limit, and global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are urgently needed. The WMO's latest climate report reveals that last year's global average temperature was 1.55 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, making it the hottest year on record in 175 years. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached a record high, with carbon dioxide levels at 420.0 PPM, a 151% increase from 1750. Methane and nitrous oxide levels also reached their highest levels in 80,000 years. The rate of ocean warming is also accelerating, with the total ocean heat content reaching a record high in 2023. Sea levels are rising rapidly, with the average sea level height reaching a record high in 2024. Glaciers are also melting at an alarming rate, with the largest decline in glacier mass occurring between 2022 and 2024. The Arctic sea ice area was the smallest in 18 years, and the Antarctic sea ice area has been below 20 million square kilometers for three consecutive years. However, the WMO notes that this one-year exceedance of 1.5 degrees does not necessarily mean that the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree limit has been failed. The long-term trend shows that the Earth's temperature increase is still within the 1.5 degree limit, with a projected range of 1.34-1.41 degrees Celsius.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202503192134015)\n\n**On Today's Date: The Epic Denver, Colorado, Blizzard Of 2003**\nOn March 19, 2003, a massive snowstorm hit Denver, Colorado, and the surrounding areas, dumping 20-40 inches of snow in the Front Range corridor and 3-7 feet of snow in the foothills. The storm caused widespread disruptions, with most interstates and local roads shut down due to deep snow or avalanches. The Denver International Airport's roof suffered a 40-foot gash, and at least 258 structures were damaged due to roof collapses or failures. The storm left 135,000 without power for several days, making it Denver's second heaviest snowstorm in recorded history. According to Jonathan Erdman, a senior meteorologist at weather.com, March is Denver's snowiest month on average, and this storm remains one of the most significant snow events in the area's history.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/todays-date-epic-denver-colorado-100000536.html)\n\n**Mauna Kea: The Mountain That Surpasses Everest**\nA scientist, Alexander Osadchii, has disputed the common notion that Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth. According to Osadchii, Mount Mauna Kea, located on the Hawaiian Islands, is actually the highest mountain, surpassing Everest by over 2,000 meters. Mauna Kea stands at 4,200 meters above sea level, but its base is mostly underwater, and its total height from its base to its summit is approximately 10,200 meters, which is higher than Everest's summit by over 2,000 meters. Osadchii explained that the Hawaiian Islands were formed by a mantle plume, a hot flow of magma from the Earth's core that rises hundreds of kilometers and creates new volcanic hotspots. As magma flows out of the ocean floor, it can form an island on the surface. The Hawaiian Islands were formed around half a million years ago, and a new volcano, Loihi, is currently growing near Mauna Kea, which has already reached a height of over 1,000 meters, Osadchii said in his Telegram channel. Interestingly, scientists have previously found microplastic particles on the summit of Everest, which they believe may have come from alpinists and their equipment. The particles were found in the 'death zone,' an area above 8,000 meters above sea level.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 05:45 AM\nSource:[\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430](https://vm.ru/news/1214606-uchenyj-osadchiev-nazval-goru-kotoraya-okazalas-vyshe-everesta)\n\n**Colorado's Copper Mountain plans large expansion, new lifts, and highest chairlift in North America**\nCopper Mountain in Colorado has announced plans to expand its skiable areas, build new lifts, and upgrade existing ones. The expansion, which could add 500 acres of skiable terrain, aims to reduce lift lines by allowing quicker and more efficient transportation. The Master Plan also includes building a Jaques East lift to access Jaques Peak, which would become the highest lift in North America, surpassing Breckenridge's current record. According to President/GM Dustin Lyman, 'Certainly, putting a chairlift above 13,000 feet, there's only a few places that you can do that,' and 'Right here in Summit County is one of those places.' Lyman emphasized the importance of considering environmental impact and sustainability, stating, 'We've got to make sure that we pay attention to the environmental impact and we have as small of a footprint as possible.' He also acknowledged the logistical challenges of the project, saying, 'Just logistically, getting back into that terrain is complicated. There's not roads that go back in there. There's not electricity or any of that type of infrastructure.' Lyman added, 'It certainly won't be next season,' indicating that the project's timeline is uncertain and may change.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 01:18 AM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-copper-mountain-expansion-ski-area-lifts/)\n\n**Snow, rain and more wind expected in Colorado, some areas on Eastern Plains will be under a blizzard warning**\nA mixed bag of weather is expected in Colorado, with rain and snow developing across the Front Range and Eastern Plains on Tuesday night.

The high country is expected to receive 10-15 inches of snow, while the Front Range mountain ranges are expected to receive 6-10 inches. Hazardous travel conditions are expected on mountain roads, including I-70, due to a flash freeze. Red flag warnings are in place for the Denver metro area and eastern Colorado, with gusts expected to reach 60 mph. Temperatures are expected to rise again by next week, with highs in the 70s in the Denver metro and 60s in the southern part of the state. According to Maggie Ideker, a forecaster with the National Weather Service, 'temperatures will be just a little bit too warm for any snow' across the Denver metro area, but 'we'll have a couple more chances for some mountain snow showers mostly on Friday and Saturday'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 10:54 AM\nSource:[Colorado Public Radio](https://www.cpr.org/2025/03/18/snow-in-the-mountains-to-affect-i-70-traffic-wind-and-fire-danger-on-the-plains/)\n\n**Warmer than normal in Colorado with High Fire Danger for some this week**\nColorado can expect a warmer-than-normal week, with high temperatures reaching the low to mid-70s in the Denver metro area. However, high fire danger is forecasted for parts of the state, particularly in Northern Colorado and areas south of Denver, due to low humidity and strong winds. Red Flag Warnings have been issued for several counties, with humidity potentially dropping as low as 5% and wind gusts reaching up to 35 mph. The weather will remain dry until a strong low-pressure system reaches Colorado by Friday, potentially bringing rain, snow, and blizzard conditions to Eastern Colorado. As First Alert Weather Team meteorologist said, 'it is still a little way out, but the potential for some rain and possible snow is there.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 04:48 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/warmer-normal-colorado-high-fire-danger-some-this-week/)\n\n**Heavy high country snow in Colorado's mountains with lighter totals moving into Denver Friday evening**\nA First Alert Weather Day has been called for Friday due to heavy snow in the high country and lighter totals expected in the Denver metro area.

The snow will clear out overnight, and by Saturday a warming trend kicks in, with temperatures building throughout the weekend and peaking at possible 70s by Monday afternoon.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 03:44 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/heavy-high-country-snow-colorados-mountains-lighter-totals-denver-friday-evening/)\n\n**When every Colorado ski resort plans to close for the season**\nAs of March 3, half of Colorado's ski areas have average or above average base depths, with some resorts reporting 95% or more of normal snowfall. Arapahoe Basin, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, and Winter Park are among the resorts with above-average base depths. However, southern Colorado ski areas are struggling, with Wolf Creek at 48% and Purgatory at 47% of normal. March can be a snowy month, so it's essential to follow storm systems. The projected closing dates for Colorado ski resorts are: Winter Park - April 27, with Mary Jane remaining open as long as conditions allow.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 09:07 PM\nSource:[The Denver Post](https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/03/colorado-ski-resort-closing-dates-2025/)\n\n**Record-high temperatures expected for Colorado\u2019s mountains this weekend, but winter isn\u2019t done yet**\nRecord-high temperatures are expected for Colorado's mountains this weekend, with parts of the Western Slope potentially reaching 10-15 degrees above normal. National Weather Service Meteorologist Brianna Bealo said, 'Enjoy it, but don't bank on it lasting.' The warm weather is due to a ridge of high pressure building over the western half of the country. Saturday is expected to be the warmest day, with temperatures in the low- to mid-60s in the Front Range and 50s in higher elevation areas. However, the warm temperatures will not last, with cooler temperatures and snow showers expected during the week of March 3. This is not a typical February, with temperatures in the low 50s, but it is not completely out of the realm of possibility, according to Bealo.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 02, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[skyhinews.com](https://www.skyhinews.com/news/colorado-record-high-temperatures-mountains-spring-winter/)\n\n**Spring-like weather through weekend in Colorado before big changes arrive early next week**\nColorado is experiencing spring-like weather through the weekend, with high temperatures averaging 15 to 20 degrees warmer than normal. The warmer-than-normal weather continues until Monday, when a system advancing from the Pacific brings cooler, unsettled weather to the region. This system is forecast to bring a rain/snow mix to the mountains by Monday afternoon, with rain and storm chances increasing in the lower elevations by Monday evening. By Tuesday, the rain will transition to snow, with the Denver area potentially seeing measurable sloppy, slushy snow. The First Alert Weather team has called Tuesday a possible First Alert Weather Day, noting that March is historically Denver's snowiest month of the year, averaging 11.5' of snow throughout the month.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 05:39 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/spring-like-weather-weekend-colorado-big-changes-arrive-next-week/)\n\n**Arctic blast seeps into Colorado until Thursday**\nAn arctic blast has invaded the Eastern half of Colorado, bringing extremely cold temperatures and wind chills as low as 25 below on the Eastern Plains.

According to the NWS, Denver has a 40 to 50 percent chance of below-normal precipitation, while the entire state of Colorado has a likelihood of below-normal precipitation. This could be a welcome relief for those tired of shoveling snow in March or April, but may be concerning for those worried about drought. Additionally, the NWS predicts higher temperatures across some parts of Colorado, with the southwestern corner having a higher chance of above-normal temperatures from March to May. Denver is on the cusp of seeing temperatures above normal, but it's too early to say for certain.
