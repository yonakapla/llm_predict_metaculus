Publicist Dmitry Ovchinnikov believes that the number of bankruptcy filings may exceed 100,000 in the next two years. While the law on bankruptcy of individuals is popular, Ovchinnikov is convinced that it does not promote responsible financial behavior. 'A person who wants to declare bankruptcy risks nothing, as they cannot lose their only home. As a result, all their debts are simply written off, and they can start accumulating new ones with a clear conscience, which they can also write off in a few years,' Ovchinnikov said. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 06:42 AM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://nsk.aif.ru/society/o-bankrotstve-v-2024-m-zayavili-svyshe-11-tysyach-zhiteley-novosibirskoy-oblasti)\n\n**Gene Therapy Market Size to Cross $16.5 Billion by 2035 | Exclusive Report by Roots Analysis**\nThe global gene therapy market size is expected to cross $16.5 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 19.25% during the forecast period 2024 to 2035.

According to Creditreform, the company's liabilities amount to 1.31 million euros, affecting around 90 creditors. The company, which specializes in furniture sales, particularly school furniture, has been in operation since 2022. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in the construction industry, the company experienced a significant decline in orders. As reported by G\u00fcnther Moser from Creditreform, 'All attempts to alleviate the liquidity crisis failed. The implemented restructuring measures were insufficient, and the liabilities continued to rise. The agreed-upon payment plans could no longer be met. The bankruptcy proceedings were initiated at the request of the Financial Prosecutor.' The company's assets amount to 535,000 euros, while liabilities stand at 1.31 million euros. All employees, except for one cleaning staff member, have left the company. The business is currently closed. If a financially capable investor is found, the company's management is still considering submitting a restructuring plan. The insolvency administrator, Dr. Mario Noe-Nordberg, has been appointed. Creditors can submit their claims through Creditreform by April 30, 2025.

Biotron has been trying to focus on various diseases and has been affected by the biotech rally that occurred from late 2024 to 2025. The company's financial position has been impacted, and they have issued a rights issue underwritten for $750,000 by Mahe Capital. Biotron's CEO stated, 'There was always a possibility that additional capital would be required to fund the next stage of development/activities now that the Phase 2 trials are completed, as was disclosed at the time, and which is standard in the industry and with a R&D company that does not have revenues.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 03:23 AM\nSource:[themarketonline.com.au](https://themarketonline.com.au/wrong-button-biotron-explains-to-asx-why-possible-bankruptcy-wasnt-price-sensitive-2025-03-04/)\n\n**Firefly Aerospace Successfully Lands on the Moon After Rising from Bankruptcy**\nFor the first time, a private company has successfully landed on the Moon. Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost spacecraft landed on the lunar surface on March 2, after rising from bankruptcy. The Blue Ghost spacecraft landed vertically and with its solar panels properly oriented to survive the 14-day lunar day. This achievement comes after the failures of Beresheet, Hakuto-R, Peregrine, and Odysseus missions. The Blue Ghost spacecraft landed in the Mare Crisium region, near the Mons Latreille volcanic formation. The instruments and sensors on board reported that Blue Ghost was in an optimal angle, and the first images of the shadow projected by the Firefly Aerospace spacecraft showed that it had landed on the lunar surface vertically. This achievement is a relief for NASA, which has been working on the CLPS program to send regular missions to the Moon on commercial spacecraft. Intuitive Machines is expected to achieve the second landing in a few days with its Nova-C Athena module. The Blue Ghost spacecraft carries a series of instruments, experiments, and technological demonstrators, mainly from NASA, which will drill into the soil to collect samples, investigate how the dust is lifted to mitigate problems in future lunar missions, and measure the level of radiation and magnetic activity in the environment. The spacecraft will deploy and operate these loads for 14 days before the lack of solar light and extremely low temperatures compromise its batteries. The mission will also capture a high-definition image of a total solar eclipse on March 14 and record a lunar sunset on March 16, showing the lunar dust levitating. Firefly Aerospace's achievement is especially notable given the company's recent history, marked by bankruptcy, internal scandal, and a high-profile change of ownership. The company was saved by Ukrainian investor Max Polykov, who invested around $200 million and revived the company. However, Polykov was forced to sell his majority stake in 2022 for a symbolic $1 due to geopolitical reasons. Since then, Firefly has been under the majority control of AE Industrial Partners. The company's current CEO is Jason Kim, who took over in October 2024 after his predecessor, Bill Weber, retired due to a reported inappropriate relationship with an employee.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 08:09 AM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/espacio/primera-vez-empresa-privada-ha-conseguido-llegar-a-luna-exito-ha-sido-resurgir-bancarrota)\n\n**Bluebird Bio Sold for 3.9 Billion Icelandic Kroner Amid Financial Difficulties**\nBluebird Bio, a biotech company once valued at 70 billion Danish kroner (approximately 1.365 billion Icelandic kroner), has been sold for just 200 million Danish kroner (approximately 3.9 billion Icelandic kroner). The company, which had developed three approved gene therapies, has faced significant financial difficulties in recent years. According to the company's management, the only way to avoid bankruptcy was to sell the company. Private equity firms Carlyle and SK Capital have acquired the company and plan to take it off the market. According to the Danish business news outlet B\u00f8rsen, Bluebird Bio was once considered a star of the biotech industry, with its stock price increasing by 1800% between 2014 and 2018. However, the company's high pricing for its treatments has been a major factor in its decline. The company's first approved treatment, Zynteglo, was priced at 12 million Danish kroner (approximately 240 million Icelandic kroner) per treatment. The company justified the high price by citing the cost of development and the social value of curing severe and debilitating diseases. However, the European healthcare system was slow to pay for such high prices, and in 2021, Bluebird Bio decided to leave the European market and focus on the US. The company's current CEO, Andrew Obenshain, criticized the European market, calling it 'broken', and the company released a statement saying that Europe did not support innovation and long-term benefits of gene therapies enough. However, the sale process did not go well in the US either, and according to the latest financial reports, the company had only sold 57 treatments in total for all three of its approved drugs. The company's financial difficulties have been evident for a long time, and in the third quarter of 2024, the company's revenue was 430 million Danish kroner, while expenses were 75 million Danish kroner. Additionally, US health authorities are now investigating whether one of the company's treatments, Skysona, may increase the risk of blood cancer. Obenshain says in a statement regarding the sale that the investment from Carlyle and SK Capital is necessary to avoid bankruptcy. He says that the company has been at the forefront of gene therapy for over a decade, but financial difficulties require a new strategy and a strong partner. As part of the sale agreement, the investors have committed to paying up to 475 million Danish kroner (approximately 9.3 billion Icelandic kroner) to the shareholders of Bluebird Bio if the company is able to increase its annual revenue to 4.3 billion Danish kroner (approximately 83.8 billion Icelandic kroner).\nOriginal language: is\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 03:02 PM\nSource:[vb.is](https://vb.is/frettir/vonarstjarna-seld-a-brotabroti-af-fyrra-markadsvirdi/)\n\n**Title: bluebird bio Announces Positive Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial Data for Gene Therapy**\nbluebird bio, Inc. has announced positive Phase 1/2 clinical trial data for their gene therapy.

The deal comes after years of financial struggles, declining stock performance, and mounting cash flow concerns. Under the terms of the agreement, bluebird shareholders will receive $3 per share in cash, with the potential for an additional $6.84 per share through a contingent value right (CVR). The CVR is tied to the company's ability to achieve $600m in net sales within a trailing 12-month period before the end of 2027. Bluebird has struggled financially in the last few years, with high development costs and slower-than-expected market adoption limiting revenue growth.

(NASDAQ:BLUE) CEO Andrew Obenshain recently sold a portion of his shares in the company. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Obenshain sold 140 shares at a price of $9.24 per share, generating approximately $1,293. This sale occurred during a period of significant volatility in the stock, with the price having dropped by around 70% from last year's level, according to InvestingPro data. The sale was made on January 6, 2025, and was intended to meet the tax withholding requirements for the exercise of stock options. After the sale, Obenshain still owns 18,571 shares in the company. InvestingPro analysis highlights the company's rapid cash burn and significant debt burden, and provides 12 additional key insights for subscribers. This sale comes after Bluebird bio's 1-for-20 reverse stock split in December 2024, which adjusted the reported share count. The sale was made as part of a pre-determined trading plan and demonstrates a planned approach to managing share holdings. The company's current market value is $83.22 million, and analysts are expecting sales growth this year. Additionally, Bluebird Bio has been subject to several analyst downgrades. RBC Capital Markets lowered its price target for the biotech company to $8 from $80, while Baird reduced its price target to $54 due to expected short-term dilution. BofA Securities also downgraded Bluebird Bio's stock to Neutral from Buy, citing a reevaluation of the company's financials and its key product, Lyfgenia. JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Low Weight after the company's third-quarter financial results, which showed a loss of $0.31 per share and revenue below consensus estimates. Despite these challenges, Bluebird Bio's CEO Andrew Obenshain stated that the company expects to reach break-even cash flow by the end of 2025, pending an increase in patient starts and the securing of additional cash sources. The company also plans to reduce its cash operating expenses by 20% by the end of 2025 and to make a stock split proposal to regain NASDAQ compliance.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 09:20 PM\nSource:[Investing.com T\u00fcrkiye](https://tr.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/bluebird-bio-ceosu-andrew-obenshain-1293-dolarlk-hisse-senedi-sats-gerceklestirdi-93CH-3205499)\n\n",

The acquisition was seen as a strategic move to avoid bankruptcy by providing necessary capital and stabilizing the company's financial position, thus negating the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing before April 1, 2025.",
