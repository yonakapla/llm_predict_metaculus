He has been endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and has a strong following among young voters. Mamdani's campaign is focused on listening to the concerns of working-class New Yorkers and addressing issues such as corruption, economic hardship, and social justice. He has been praised for his willingness to talk about social issues alongside economic hardship and corruption, and for his commitment to fighting for the rights of marginalized communities. However, he will face stiff competition from other left-leaning candidates, including progressive favorite Brad Lander and liberal titan Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's ability to distinguish himself from the pack and win over voters will be crucial in his bid for the mayoralty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor/)\n\n**The Race to Outrank Cuomo**\nAndrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, is considering a run for mayor of New York City, despite his resignation in disgrace three years ago. Cuomo's universal name recognition and deep executive experience make him a formidable candidate, but his opponents are trying to exploit his vulnerabilities, including his handling of sexual-harassment scandals and his pandemic response. Brad Lander, the progressive city comptroller, is aiming to be the primary alternative to Cuomo, but he faces a major challenge in winning over voters beyond his affluent Brooklyn base. Adrienne Adams, the City Council Speaker, has entered the fray, but she faces a significant fundraising gap and will need to play catch-up with the other Democrats. The use of ranked-choice voting in the primary could impact the outcome, and some are speculating that Cuomo's superior name recognition will carry the day, while others believe that RCV can punish polarizing candidates like Cuomo.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[NYMag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-race-to-outrank-andrew-cuomo.html)\n\n**City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams enters race for mayor**\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has announced her candidacy for mayor, becoming the 10th Democrat to join the race. Adams stated, 'New Yorkers can't afford to live here, City Hall is in chaos, and Donald Trump is corrupting our city's independence. It's time to stand up.' She aims to serve the people of New York City, not her own interests. Political experts say she could be a viable alternative, but her late entry into the race and lack of a campaign make it an uphill climb. Adams' appeal to Black voters in southeast Queens and Brooklyn could siphon off support from Mayor Eric Adams and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Her team hopes she will be the choice of dissatisfied New Yorkers. Mayor Adams responded, 'Come one, come all,' and questioned the motives of her competitors. During her tenure as Council Speaker, Adams has clashed with Mayor Adams on issues like housing vouchers and mayoral appointments. She has taken up progressive causes and claims to be above labels, focusing on public service. Adams is expected to host a campaign kickoff rally in Queens on Saturday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[nystateofpolitics.com](https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/politics/2025/03/06/city-council-speaker-adrienne-adams-announces-mayoral-run)\n\n**NYC mayor's race heats up as Mayor Eric Adams touts decreases in gun violence and Andrew Cuomo spars with Brad Lander**\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams touted decreases in gun violence, saying the city is the 'safest big city in America.' He criticized opponents who claim the city is in chaos and crisis, saying 'the numbers don't lie.' Adams pointed to a 21.5% decrease in shootings in January and a 20.8% decrease in February, the lowest in the city's recorded history. Meanwhile, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo picked up the endorsement of the electrical workers union, IBEW Local 3, and slammed opponents like City Comptroller Brad Lander over public safety. Cuomo called for e-bike regulations and financial liability for food delivery companies in accidents caused by riders. Lander continued to slam Cuomo over the sexual harassment charges that led to his resignation as governor, saying he should return $60 million to taxpayers and put it to public safety.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 11:53 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-york-city-mayoral-race-eric-adams-andrew-cuomo-brad-lander/)\n\n**Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo focus on crime as race for New York City mayor heats up**\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo are focusing on crime as a key issue in the mayoral election. Despite declining crime rates, Cuomo claims the city is 'out-of-control' and has proposed hiring 5,000 additional police officers and cracking down on e-bikes. Adams argues that the problem is bail reform, which he believes allows repeat offenders to be released back onto the streets. A recent poll shows that 55% of New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Adams, while 51% have a favorable view of Cuomo. However, Democrats will decide the primary, and Cuomo has received three major union endorsements in the past three weeks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 11:01 PM\nSource:[ABC7 New York](https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-mayoral-race-eric-adams-andrew-cuomo-focus-crime-biggest-issues-facing-candidates/16003755/)\n\n**Barry Diller backs Andrew Cuomo's bid for NYC mayor out of...**\nMedia mogul Barry Diller has endorsed former New York Gov.

Diller stated, 'I think he'd be a very good mayor of New York. I don't think [current mayor Eric] Adams will or should survive politically.' Diller also expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the Democratic Party, calling their reaction to President Trump's address to Congress 'pathetic and unfortunate.'

Cuomo's moderate policies and high name recognition could make him a strong contender, but he also faces criticism for his past controversies, including allegations of sexual harassment and corruption. Meanwhile, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has also joined the race, offering a moderate alternative to Cuomo and Adams. Dr. Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, believes that Cuomo's entry could be an opportunity for other challengers, such as Zellnor Myrie and Zohran Mamdani, to gain traction by framing their policy issues in a way that contrasts with Cuomo's baggage. The field is crowded, and ranked-choice voting could lead to unpredictable results, but Greer thinks that Adrienne Adams could be a strong contender if she can raise money and get signatures to be on the stage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[NYMag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-much-has-andrew-cuomo-scrambled-the-mayoral-race.html)\n\n**The Race for the NYC Democratic Nomination**\nTen candidates are running for the Democratic nomination in the NYC mayoral election, challenging incumbent Eric Adams. Adams has faced low approval ratings and investigations into allegations of bribery and straw donations. His campaign website emphasizes his working-class background and commitment to making NYC safer and more affordable. Other candidates include Andrew Cuomo, a former governor and U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment; Brad Landers, the NYC Comptroller and a progressive politician; Zohran, who wants to freeze rent, improve public transportation, and raise the minimum wage; Zellnor, a NY state senator who supports abortion rights and climate change regulations; Ramos, a NY state senator who has advocated for workers' rights and union support; Stringer, a former NYC Comptroller and Manhattan Borough President who has been accused of sexual harassment; and Adrienne Adams, a city councilor and speaker who has been a vocal critic of Mayor Adams and is running on the slogan 'Somebody has to be the voice of the soul of the city.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 10:46 AM\nSource:[www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/the-race-for-the-nyc-democratic-nomination-5822735)\n\n**For #MeToo Movement, Mayor's Race in New York City Poses a Test**\nThe #MeToo movement is being tested in New York City's mayoral race, where three Democratic candidates - Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams, and Scott Stringer - have faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Cuomo has denied the allegations, while Adams and Stringer have also denied the claims, with Adams' accuser, Lorna Beach-Mathura, saying she was glad that voters would now 'be more informed about who Eric Adams is.' The allegations have been a challenge for the candidates, with Cuomo facing a defamation lawsuit from one of his accusers, and Adams facing federal corruption charges. The #MeToo movement has faced setbacks, but it has not disappeared, according to law professor Suzanne B. Goldberg. Some women say the presence of three male candidates with #MeToo allegations underscores the urgency to elect the city's first female mayor, with two women running: Ms. Ramos and Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker. Ms. Ramos said in a statement that voters deserved better choices on the ballot, 'If people think their only choice is between a sex pest and a corrupt liar, of course they're not going to think government can work for them.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/nyregion/cuomo-stringer-metoo-harassment.html)\n\n**Barry Diller backs Andrew Cuomo's mayoral bid**\nMedia mogul Barry Diller is supporting Andrew Cuomo's bid for New York City mayor, citing Cuomo's help in building the city's Little Island public park.

He also criticized the Democratic Party, calling their reaction to President Donald Trump's address to Congress 'pathetic and unfortunate,' and stating that 'the Democratic Party is in complete disarray, there's no leadership.'

She cited the city's affordability crisis, City Hall's chaos, and Donald Trump's influence as reasons for her decision. 'New Yorkers can't afford to live here, City Hall is in chaos, and Donald Trump is corrupting our city's independence. It's time to stand up,' she said. Adams has low name recognition and will need to quickly fundraise and build a team with fewer than four months until the June 24 Democratic primary. She has the support of public advocate Jumaane Williams, who said, 'I am very excited about Adrienne. Very excited. I want to see what she brings.' Adams' entrance speaks to dissatisfaction with the mayor, who received a paltry 20 percent approval rating in a recent Quinnipiac poll.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 02:35 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/another-eric-adams-rival-jumping-022713001.html)\n\n**Speaker's final State of the City address doubles as potential mayoral campaign launch  --  Queens Daily Eagle**\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams delivered her fourth annual State of the City address, which some saw as a potential mayoral campaign launch. Adams highlighted the Council's accomplishments and outlined her vision for city leadership, centered around collaboration and 'collective power.' She also took shots at Mayor Eric Adams and President Donald Trump, and rejected labels of being a 'moderate' in a progressive-dominated race. Adams proposed several initiatives for her final year leading the Council, including expanding 7-day library service and creating a Minority-Owned Business Accelerator. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams praised Adams' focus on service and effectiveness, and her agenda for strengthening public health and safety, expanding housing access, and protecting all New Yorkers. Adams is expected to make a decision about her mayoral run by the end of the week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 04:12 PM\nSource:[Queens Daily Eagle](https://queenseagle.com/all/2025/3/5/speakers-final-state-of-the-city-address-doubles-as-potential-mayoral-campaign-launch)\n\n**Jumaane Williams Says He\u2019s Ready and Willing to Take Mayor Adams\u2019s Place**\nJumaane Williams, New York City's public advocate, has stated that he is ready and willing to take Mayor Eric Adams's place if he were to resign or be removed. Williams is first in line to succeed Adams, and his potential interim leadership could further complicate a mayoral primary that is already in flux. Williams has been critical of Adams's leadership and has called for him to step aside. He has also reached out to departing deputy mayors to ask if they would reconsider leaving if he were to become mayor. Williams has said that he plans to seek another term as public advocate and maintained that he is not angling for the mayor's position, but acknowledged the possibility of assuming the top office in City Hall. 'It's irresponsible not to make sure that you're prepared for every eventuality,' Williams said. 'In case something happens before November, we're going to make sure that we're prepared to keep that confidence or restore that confidence that he's worked hard to erase.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 08:08 AM\nSource:[dnyuz.com](https://dnyuz.com/2025/02/22/jumaane-williams-says-hes-ready-and-willing-to-take-mayor-adamss-place/)\n\n**Jumaane Williams Is Ready and Willing to Take Mayor Eric Adams's Place**\nJumaane Williams, New York City's public advocate, is being considered as a potential replacement for Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing a federal corruption case.

According to a source, James is exploring the possibility of Adams running for mayor. The source also mentioned that the Democratic Party is looking for a candidate other than Cuomo, as the current candidates are unable to beat him. Adams' name was first seriously discussed as a potential mayoral candidate last weekend, when she attended the annual event of the New York State ABPRHAL in Albany, where she reportedly had a conversation with James. James has also been privately contacting high-ranking Democrats to gauge their interest in Adams running for mayor. Adams has recently called for the resignation of current Mayor Eric Adams, and her city council has taken a stance on criminal justice issues that differs from the conservative views of the mayor and the NYPD. She has also supported a controversial bill, the 'How Many Stops Act', which was opposed by the mayor and the NYPD but ultimately passed. If Mayor Adams were to resign or be removed from office, who would become the acting mayor? According to the New York City Charter, the Public Advocate would take over as acting mayor. The current Public Advocate is Jumaane Williams, who served as a city council member from the 45th district in Brooklyn from 2010 to 2019. Williams is considered a left-wing Democrat who advocates for tenant and minority rights, supports defunding the police, and opposes solitary confinement in prisons.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/2/20/n14441264.htm)\n\n**Adrienne Adams Considered as Potential Challenger to Andrew Cuomo in NYC Mayoral Race**\nNew York State Attorney General Letitia James is reportedly encouraging New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams to run for mayor, with the goal of blocking former Governor Andrew Cuomo's return to politics.

Some Democratic Party insiders have expressed concerns that Adams may be too late to enter the race, as some of her potential competitors have already raised hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign funds. Cuomo, who was forced to resign as governor in 2021 after a report by James' office found him to have sexually harassed multiple women, has not yet officially announced his candidacy for mayor, but has received support from the Staten Island Democratic Party and the Village Reform Democratic Club.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 03:57 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/2/20/n14441264.htm)\n\n**The Man Who Could Become New York City's Emergency Mayor**\nJumaane Williams, the current public advocate of New York City, could become the city's emergency mayor if Mayor Eric Adams resigns or is removed. Williams has been a fervent critic of police abuses of power and has advocated for defunding the police. He has also supported tax hikes on those making more than $300,000. Martin Dolan, a Democrat and former banker, plans to run against Williams in the June primary for public advocate. Dolan has criticized Williams, saying he has been a 'complete disaster' as public advocate and would be a 'complete disaster' as mayor. Williams has said he is preparing for the scenario of becoming mayor and has been meeting with business leaders to reassure them that he would not use the position to enact his own policy agenda. He has also said he would run for election outright in the nonpartisan special election he would be required to schedule within 80 days. Williams' supporters attribute his popularity to his authenticity and integrity, and he has been open about his struggles with mental health and his family's difficulties. 'You need a public advocate who's trying to pack jobs into New York, who's pro-business, who's pro-lower taxes,' Dolan said. 'Let's make the city's economic architecture as appealing as possible for families and businesses.' Williams 'stands for everything that's the opposite of that,' Dolan added. Williams has said he is 'pragmatic' and believes in 'pragmatic optimism,' and that compromises are an essential part of governing. 'I think folks don't realize how pragmatic I am in trying to make sure we're governed the right way,' Williams said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Williams claims that Adams has 'sold out' marginalized New Yorkers and the city's values to avoid personal and legal accountability. Mayor Adams has denied the allegations, stating that he has not broken the law and has not traded his power as an elected official for personal benefit. However, Williams remains unimpressed, saying that Adams is 'compromised' and is making decisions that are 'harmful to our city.'

However, he has reached out to Republican county leaders, sparking speculation about his intentions. Meanwhile, Adams's challengers are gaining momentum, with some receiving significant endorsements and fund-raising support. The campaign may depend on whether Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who resigned as governor in 2021, decides to run. Cuomo regularly leads in polls, but has not made his candidacy official.

A recent poll shows Andrew Cuomo, the former governor, as the front-runner, despite having unfavorable qualities. Cuomo has millions in his state campaign war chest, but would need to meet city criteria and individually authorize donations. The primary election, which is ranked choice, has early voting from June 14 to 22 and primary day on June 24. Campaign finance totals show Adams falling behind, with current comptroller Brad Lander surpassing him in cash on hand. Cuomo is considering rolling out his campaign next month, with his spokesman saying that New Yorkers know his record. Public advocate Jumaane Williams has expressed concerns about Cuomo's leadership style, saying that he has been 'very harmful' to New York City residents.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[newsday.com](https://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/mayor-adams-indictment-cuomo-democratic-primary-xfus6aub)\n\n**Beating Cuomo a priority in NYC mayoral campaigns**\nBrad Lander, the city comptroller, is running for mayor to unseat Eric Adams and prevent Andrew Cuomo from taking office. Lander said, 'Make no mistake, Andrew Cuomo would not be any better' than Adams. Cuomo is rumored to be planning a mayoral run, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams is considering running to prevent Cuomo from becoming mayor. Williams said, 'I would consider doing whatever is needed to do to prevent a Cuomo mayoralty.' Lander's campaign manager, Alison Hirsh, said, 'We're looking forward to contrasting Brad's strong management, outstanding public integrity and big ideas to move our city forward, with Andrew Cuomo's never-ending corruption, scandal and inept mismanagement.' Cuomo's spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, responded, 'This is all premature, but everyone knows Lander's DSA-approved defund the police, anti-Israel positions are out of touch with New Yorkers and it's sad he spends all his time obsessed with a guy who isn't currently in the race while ignoring the actual job taxpayers are paying him for.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 04:29 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/beating-cuomo-priority-nyc-mayoral-162945692.html)\n\n",
