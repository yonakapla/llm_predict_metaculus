According to DOGE, this translates to an average of $714.29 per taxpayer, based on 2022 figures. However, using the latest tax return year of 2023, the average saved per taxpayer would be $705.09. DOGE says the biggest savings have come from the General Services Administration (GSA), followed by the Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The agency has terminated over 5,350 contracts, worth around $20 billion, and nearly 7,500 grants, worth $17 billion. Additionally, nearly 800 leases have been canceled, resulting in $500 million in lease savings. DOGE was created by President Donald Trump and will operate until July 4, 2026. 'It is unclear exactly where the bulk of the GSA cuts emanate from,' the article notes. DOGE has faced criticism over its access to federal systems and its efforts to cancel federal contracts and make cuts at various agencies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/doge-claims-cuts-have-saved-whopping-115b-around-700-per-taxpayer)\n\n**DOGE's latest savings claims \"seem overstated,\" BofA analysts say By Investing.com**\nAnalysts at BofA have questioned the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) latest claim of saving $20 billion through federal contract cancellations and renegotiations, stating that the figure 'seems overstated.' According to BofA, the actual savings are around $18 billion, but the analysts have concerns about DOGE's methodology, which they believe could be misleading. They also identified 'some cases' of double counting in the elimination of contracts and subcontracts. BofA analysts led by Mariana Perez Mora noted that the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Treasury Department were the most heavily impacted agencies, while General Dynamics and Booz Allen Hamilton received significant reductions in funding.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/doges-latest-savings-claims-seem-overstated-bofa-analysts-say-3929403)\n\n**'Doge' Measures: Hundreds of US Government Offices Could Close**\nElon Musk's 'Department of government efficiency', also known as 'Doge', plans to terminate hundreds of US government office leases, citing unnecessary state expenses. According to internal documents, over 800 leases will be canceled, with many set to expire by June 30. This move is expected to save around $500 million, although this figure does not account for the costs of relocation and closure. Musk's team has been prioritizing leases that can be terminated without penalty within a few months. The decision has sparked appeals from various US agencies and lawmakers to exempt certain buildings from the measure. 'Doge' has informed landlords of its plans, with the goal of reducing unnecessary expenses. As Musk stated, 'Doge' will continue to target 'unnecessary state expenses'.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 10:53 AM\nSource:[Euronews Deutsch](https://de.euronews.com/2025/03/14/nach-doge-massnahmen-hunderte-von-us-bundesamtern-konnten-bald-schliessen)\n\n**Elon Musk's DOGE: A Mixed Bag on Budget Cuts?**\nElon Musk's Department of Efficiency (DOGE) has been tasked with reducing the US federal deficit by $1 trillion. However, the results of their efforts are not yet clear. According to the US Treasury, the country's federal spending in February 2025 was actually higher than in February 2024, at $603 billion compared to $567 billion. Analyst Jessica Riedl notes that the savings made by the DOGE are 'too small to be identifiable in the total monthly spending figures' for each ministry. The DOGE has focused on cutting budgets for smaller ministries, such as education and the environment, but has not yet touched the larger areas of spending, such as defense and social security. The agency has announced plans to reduce staff at NASA, and it is unclear which ministries will be next to face budget cuts.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 05:32 AM\nSource:[LExpress.fr](https://www.lexpress.fr/economie/coupes-budgetaires-aux-etats-unis-le-doge-delon-musk-pas-si-efficace-OPVZ4B72INHZZIG4KN3QTXAO4A/)\n\n**States Most Affected by DOGE Cuts: A Report by WalletHub**\nThe Department of Efficiency Government (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, aims to reduce the federal government's spending of $1 billion this year by firing workers, canceling contracts, and cutting budgets across all areas. According to a report, the states with the highest federal dependence will be most affected by these cuts. The report analyzed data to determine the federal dependence of both state governments and residents, considering tax revenue, federal employment, and federal funding as a percentage of state income. Chip Lupo of WalletHub stated, 'Regardless of whether the distribution of federal funds is fair or not, living in one of the states with the highest federal dependence can be beneficial for residents.' He added, 'For every dollar residents of these states pay in taxes, they receive several dollars back in federal funds, which often translates to better infrastructure, education, and public health, among other benefits.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 03:12 AM\nSource:[as](https://as.com/us/actualidad/atencion-si-vives-en-uno-de-estos-5-estados-estos-son-los-que-mas-sufriran-los-recortes-del-doge-de-elon-musk-n/)\n\n**DOGE obscures details of savings after posting error-filled data on its website**\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been accused of obscuring details of its savings after posting error-filled data on its website. The agency, which was created to promote transparency, has removed identifying information from its website, making it impossible for independent organizations to fact-check their savings claims. This move comes after a federal judge ruled that DOGE must comply with public transparency laws due to its 'unprecedented' authority and 'unusual secrecy.' The White House has argued that DOGE's records should be protected until at least 2034, despite Musk's previous calls for 'maximum transparency.' The agency's savings goals have also been questioned, with some reports suggesting that firing every federal worker outside the military or USPS would only save $245.8 billion a year, a far cry from Musk's promised goal of saving $1 trillion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 09:12 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/musk-doge-savings-data-errors-report-b2714827.html)\n\n**DOGE adds to Wall of Savings: here's where it claims it will save money in Michigan**\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has released its weekly update to the 'Wall of Receipts,' claiming to have saved the government money by cancelling grants and contracts, as well as terminating leases for the National Park Service and other agencies. The agency claims to have saved $9.3 million and $7.9 million by terminating leases in Charles Town, West Virginia and Moab, Utah, respectively. Musk stated in an interview with Fox News that DOGE employees are in nearly every government department and could double its staff over the next year. President Donald Trump praised Musk's efforts with DOGE and acknowledged him as the head of the agency, saying, 'I have created the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, perhaps you've heard of it, which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 07:15 PM\nSource:[mlive](https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/03/doge-adds-to-wall-of-savings-heres-where-it-claims-it-will-save-money-in-michigan.html)\n\n**DOGE Fails to Meet Goal of Reducing US Federal Spending**\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) did not meet its goal of reducing US federal spending by $603 billion in February, according to the US Treasury Department's data cited by Financial Times. DOGE claimed that it had reduced spending by over $100 billion in the first month, but actual reductions were only reported in a few departments. The largest reduction was in the Education Ministry, where 6 billion dollars was saved by dismissing a significant portion of employees. Overall, state spending increased by 40 billion dollars, or 7%, compared to February 2024. Musk has previously called for reducing federal spending by $1 trillion and reducing government spending by 4 billion dollars a day. Jessica Ridley, an economic policy expert at the Manhattan Institute, told FT that 'DOGE's economy is so small that it can't be detected in overall monthly spending'. The situation is not only observed in DOGE's initiatives. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) also reduced its monthly spending by 574 million dollars to 226 million dollars, according to an audit by State Comptroller Marco Rubino. However, these reductions are insignificant compared to the additional 5 billion dollars added to the budget for healthcare and social spending (plus 8 billion dollars).\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 05:56 PM\nSource:[\u0413\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430.uz](https://www.gazeta.uz/uz/2025/03/13/doge/)\n\n**Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency Fails to Meet Primary Goal**\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has failed to meet its primary goal of reducing US government spending, which reached a record high of $603 billion in February. Despite claiming to have saved the government over $100 billion, the DOGE has only managed to reduce spending in a handful of departments, with overall spending increasing by $40 billion compared to the same period last year. The DOGE has been criticized for its handling of the budget, with a judge ordering the government to rehire thousands of employees who were fired by Musk. The DOGE has also been accused of overstepping its authority and facing multiple lawsuits. Meanwhile, the US government is facing a potential shutdown if the Senate does not approve the House of Representatives' budget bill by Saturday. The bill, which was passed by the House, includes a 0.1% reduction in the federal budget, but also includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a $2 trillion reduction in federal spending over the next decade, which would increase the deficit by $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 02:33 PM\nSource:[lavanguardia.com](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20250313/10477031/musk-logra-recortes-objetivo-principal-gasto-ee-uu-alcanzo-febrero-cifra-record.html)\n\n**DOGE Releases 'Government Efficiency Ranking List' Claiming $65 Billion in Savings**\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has released a 'Government Efficiency Ranking List' claiming to have saved $65 billion. The list ranks government institutions that have achieved the most savings through contract cancellations and other cost-cutting measures. According to DOGE, the estimated total savings amount has reached $65 billion as of Monday. Musk proudly shared the news on X, saying, 'The @DOGE department/agency ranking list shows the progress within the government, so the public can see who has made the most or least progress!' DOGE stated that the savings came from 'fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancellation, contract/lease renegotiation, asset sale, grant cancellation, layoffs, project change, and regulatory savings combined.' DOGE emphasized that they are working to upload all this data in an easy-to-understand and fully transparent manner, making clear assumptions that comply with applicable rules and regulations. The department listed contracts from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) publicly released, but noted that FPDS may publish final termination notices with a delay of up to one month, 'FPDS and the numbers published may differ, which are directly from agency contracting officers.' In DOGE's 'Government Efficiency Ranking List,' the Department of Education, General Services Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Labor Department, and Office of Personnel Management ranked in the top five for savings. The institutions that saved the least were the State Department, National Institutes of Health, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, and Department of Commerce.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8hHTgPENhwd)\n\n**DOGE touts $65B in reported savings, tracks agency efficiency with new dashboard**\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reported $65 billion in estimated savings from cost-cutting procedures, including contract cancellations and workforce reductions. The agency has also launched the 'Agency Efficiency Leaderboard' to track which government agencies are the most efficient. The top agencies with the most savings are the Department of Education, General Services Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Labor, and Office of Personnel Management. On the other hand, the State Department, National Institutes of Health, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce have reported the least savings. DOGE notes that nearly 40% of canceled contracts did not save any money since the total value was already fully obligated. The agency is working to make the data more transparent and accessible through its website, which also features an interactive 'Wall of Receipts' and tracks agency spending and workforce wages.

The savings came from various sources, including fraud detection, contract cancellations, asset sales, workforce reductions, and regulatory savings. DOGE aims to update its website twice a week with the goal of eventually updating in real-time. The top 10 agencies with the most total savings include the Department of Education, General Services Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency, while the top 10 agencies with the least total savings include the Department of State, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Transportation. DOGE's cuts included ending subscriptions to publications like Politico, Bloomberg, and the Washington Post, which has saved more than $1.5 million and $20 million in leadership training at the Consumer Protection Bureau.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 06:44 PM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/finance/streettalk/doge-elon-musk-donald-trump/2025/02/25/id/1200426/)\n\n**Nearly 40% of DOGE's canceled contracts expected to yield no savings**\nAccording to the Trump administration's data, nearly 40% of the 417 contracts canceled by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are expected to yield no savings, totaling $478 million. The DOGE, led by Elon Musk, aims to cut and organize federal government spending, estimating $65 billion in savings as of February 24, 2025. The agency attributes the savings to various measures, including fraud detection and contract renegotiations. However, the canceled contracts often have a legal requirement to spend the funds, resulting in no savings. Musk and President Trump will continue their efforts to reduce spending, with federal employees facing uncertainty after Musk's email directive to explain their accomplishments or risk being fired.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 04:21 PM\nSource:[FOX 10](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/doge-elon-musk-trump-savings-federal-government-employees-canceled-contracts)\n\n**Elon Musk's Ranking of US Government Agencies Based on Economic Savings Raises Concerns**\nBillionaire Elon Musk has published a ranking of US government agencies based on their economic savings on the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) website. The ranking is a competition, with the Department of Education at the top and the Department of State at the bottom. However, experts have criticized the data for errors in calculation, including confusing millions and billions. According to CBS News, Doge misinterpreted the nature of several documents, leading to an overestimation of economic savings by $1.96 billion. Additionally, the budget cuts touted by Elon Musk have raised concerns among experts that they could compromise the US government's ability to manage potential future crises, such as a pandemic. The Doge has, for example, laid off 20 FDA employees, who are responsible for monitoring food and drugs in the US. The Doge website claims that the total estimated savings are $65 billion, which can be attributed to a combination of fraud detection, contract cancellations, renegotiations, asset sales, subsidy cancellations, staff reductions, program changes, and regulatory savings.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 11:02 AM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/international/elon-musk-met-la-pression-aux-administrations-avec-un-classement-de-leurs-economies-realisees_AN-202502250372.html)\n\n**DOGE claims $65B in total estimated savings as 'Agency Efficiency Leaderboard' is launched**\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has launched an 'Agency Efficiency Leaderboard' showing government agencies that have saved the most through cost-cutting measures.

                "initial_reasoning": "To begin estimating the probability of the Department of State having the highest rank in Least Total Savings on DOGE's Agency Efficiency Leaderboard by April 1, 2025, I must consider historical data on departmental savings and efficiencies. Historically, government departments such as the Department of State have undergone various reforms intended to improve efficiency. However, these reforms typically lead to changes in rankings across multiple departments, rather than consistently placing one department at the bottom.
