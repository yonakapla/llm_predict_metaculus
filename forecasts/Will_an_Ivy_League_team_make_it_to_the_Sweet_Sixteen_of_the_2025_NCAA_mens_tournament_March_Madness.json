Among the biggest snubs are the Virginia Tech Hokies, UNLV Rebels, James Madison Dukes, and Quinnipiac Bobcats. The Hokies finished 18-12 on the season and 9-9 in ACC play, but lost seven of their final 11 games, including a loss to Georgia Tech in their first ACC tournament game.

Yale won the regular season title with a 13-1 record and is the favorite to win the tournament, but their defense can be beaten. They have struggled with limiting offensive rebounding by their opponents and giving up points, but their strong offense has allowed them to overcome these issues. According to the author, Yale is the best team in the league and should win the tournament '75% of the time.' The tournament will consist of three quick games in Rhode Island, with no reseeding, travel, or days off.

While some coaches prefer this format, others, like Harvard's Tommy Amaker and Brown's Martin, believe that all eight teams should be included. The Ivy League sponsors postseason tournaments in most of its other sports, but restricts the competition to the top four finishers in regular season play. The current format has led to recent success for the Ivy men's basketball champion, with Yale and Princeton both making deep runs in the NCAA Tournament in recent years. However, coaches and administrators point out that the cost of running an eight-team tournament is a consideration, and that the decision ultimately lies with the eight school presidents and athletic directors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/13/metro/march-sadness-ivy-league-tournament-harvard-brown-princeton-dartmouth/)\n\n**Men's Champ Week tickets punched: 14 of 31 conference tournament winners crowned**\nFourteen conference tournament champions have been crowned in men's college basketball's Champ Week, with more teams competing to cut down the nets in their respective league finals.
