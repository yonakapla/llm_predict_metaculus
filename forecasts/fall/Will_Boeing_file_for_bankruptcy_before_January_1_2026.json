FAA production approval unlocks additional near-term revenue and cash (with aircraft payments weighted to delivery milestones), and backlog is robust, offering a multi-year cash flow buffer when operational. Free cash flow trends, while still negative, are improving; significant working capital is tied up in inventory, which will convert to cash as deliveries accelerate. Most importantly, Boeing's strategic significance grants it considerable government and market support, and the recent rebound in stock price and analyst optimism shows renewed market confidence. While some bankruptcy risk exists, particularly based on distress models and certification setbacks, it would likely take an external shock or a sudden liquidity freeze\u2014none of which are evident in the current news cycle. Therefore, even with distress metrics, the probability of a bankruptcy filing within 2.5 months is very low: the base rate for this kind of event in blue-chip, system-critical industrials is minuscule.

Moreover, you acknowledge this\u2014but still anchor your reasoning on the metric's distress call. Altman's model was meant for smaller, less strategically critical manufacturers, not a duopolist with a $600B+ backlog and robust ongoing market access. Relying so much on the signal of a single metric, when all market, regulatory, and disclosure evidence points away from acute crisis, sells short the real-world context and the nature of bankruptcy triggers in US systemically important firms.

Critiques in discussion correctly dismiss the Altman Z-score and similar metrics as overestimating risk for a systemically important, asset-rich duopolist like Boeing. Most salient is the point that the FAA\u2019s October approval and the restoration of higher production rates, together with the government/creditor and supply chain incentives, act as a failsafe overwhelmingly likely to prevent a bankruptcy filing within the brief resolution window.

The highest cited probability in the group was 7%, with some as low as 2%.

Although some forecasters argued for a nonzero risk due to distress metrics, the group sharply converges on sub-5% and even sub-3% as the realistic range for the current window. In light of this, while my initial 5% forecast is conservative and within the defensible band, I recognize that the base rate, order book buffer, observable market confidence, and short time horizon make a sub-5% estimate even more justified.

Some arguments even suggest that the probability is below 1%, as even distressed metrics appear largely detached from real bankruptcy risk in this short window and unique context.

This decision, reported by Reuters and AFP, marks a significant step forward for Boeing following safety concerns triggered by a January 2024 incident involving Alaska Airlines, where a missing door plug caused a cabin decompression at 16,000 feet (4,900 meters), revealing systemic production quality and safety flaws. The FAA conducted intensive safety reviews of Boeing\u2019s production lines and confirmed that its direct oversight of Boeing\u2019s operations remains unchanged. The FAA also allowed Boeing to issue self-certification for certain 737 MAX aircraft\u2014the first such authorization since 2019. Boeing stated it will increase production 'in a disciplined manner' while prioritizing 'safety and quality,' and expressed gratitude to its teams, suppliers, and the FAA. The company\u2019s stock rose 1.2% in after-hours trading. The production increase is critical for Boeing\u2019s financial recovery, as the company faces $53 billion in debt\u2014up from $12 billion in 2018\u2014and has reported annual losses over the past six years. Analysts expect continued losses in 2025 but anticipate profitability by 2026, the first since 2018. This milestone comes after the 2018 and 2019 crashes of two 737 MAX 8 aircraft that killed 346 people, leading to a global grounding and a major loss of market share. In October 2024, Airbus surpassed Boeing in deliveries, with its A320 family overtaking the 737 as the world\u2019s most delivered aircraft.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 11:24 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%84%D9%80%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%BA-%D8%A8%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-737-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B3)\n\n**Boeing wins FAA approval to hike 737 MAX production - Companies - The Jakarta Post**\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved Boeing to increase the production rate of its 737 MAX aircraft to 42 planes per month, marking a significant step in the company's recovery following a 2024 mid-air emergency involving an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 that lost four critical bolts, resulting in a fuselage breach at 4,900 meters. The incident exposed widespread production safety and quality lapses at Boeing. The FAA conducted extensive reviews of Boeing's production lines to ensure the increase is safe. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford personally confirmed the approval with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg. Boeing plans to ramp up production using newly added equipment at its Seattle-area factories, with workers preparing for the transition. The company emphasized its commitment to safety and quality, stating it appreciates the collaboration with its team, suppliers, and the FAA. Boeing's shares rose 1.2% in after-hours trading. Despite past production challenges, Boeing has strengthened its supply chain resilience by stockpiling $11 billion in raw materials\u2014up from $6.4 billion in 2018\u2014and building substantial inventories as a buffer against disruptions. However, the company remains heavily indebted, with $53 billion in debt compared to $12 billion in 2018. Wall Street analysts project Boeing will lose money again in 2025 but expects profitability by 2026, its first since 2018. The FAA had previously revoked Boeing\u2019s authority to issue airworthiness certificates for 737 MAX and 787 aircraft in 2019 and 2022, respectively, due to safety and quality issues. In September 2024, the FAA proposed a $3.1 million fine for hundreds of quality violations found at Boeing\u2019s Renton factory and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 Wichita facility between September 2023 and February 2024.

According to an Oliver Wyman report for the International Air Transport Association (IATA), these delays are expected to cost the aviation industry over $11 billion (approximately \u20ac9.5 billion) in 2025. Global aircraft order backlogs reached a record high of over 17,000 units in 2024, up from around 13,000 annually between 2010 and 2019, increasing the average delivery time to 6.8 years in 2024, compared to 4.5 years in 2018. Willie Walsh, IATA\u2019s Director General, stated that unprecedented wait times for aircraft, engines, and spare parts, along with unpredictable delivery schedules, have led to a 'vertiginous' cost increase and constrained airlines' ability to meet consumer demand. Carlos Garc\u00eda Mart\u00edn of Oliver Wyman noted that while the current fleet is the largest, most advanced, and fuel-efficient ever, supply chain challenges are affecting both airlines and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Additional cost drivers include rising ownership costs, shifts in fleet financing\u2014where leasing now accounts for 58% of the fleet by end-2023 (up from 10% in the 1970s)\u2014and regional disparities, with 70% of fleets leased in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, compared to 40% in North America. Despite a 10.4% rise in passenger demand in 2024, which pushed load factors to a record 83.5%, aircraft deliveries in 2024 (766 units) remained below the 2019 peak of 863, with total deliveries at 1,226 versus 1,374 in 2019. The report forecasts the global commercial aerospace market will exceed $230 billion in 2025 and fully recover pre-pandemic levels by 2027, with an average annual growth of 5% over the next decade. OEMs are expected to grow at more than double the rate of maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) markets. The root causes include the current industry economic model, geopolitical instability, raw material shortages, and rigid labor markets. Solutions include opening the aftermarket market to increase airline access to parts and services, and improving supply chain transparency to help airlines plan around disruptions and assist OEMs in addressing bottlenecks.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[Hosteltur.com. e-comunicaci\u00f3n para el turismo del futuro](https://www.hosteltur.com/172245_los-cuatro-factores-que-disparan-los-costes-de-las-aerolineas-por-los-problemas-en-la-cadena-de-suministro.html)\n\n**Airbus Tops Boeing in Aircraft Production: A320 Crowned King of the Skies**\nAirbus has surpassed Boeing in total aircraft production, with 12,257 A320s delivered compared to Boeing's 12,254 737s as of September 2024. This milestone marks a symbolic victory for Airbus, whose single-aisle A320 entered service in 1988 and became a best-seller, particularly due to its more fuel-efficient and quieter 'neo' variant. Boeing, meanwhile, has faced significant challenges, including two fatal crashes of the 737 MAX8 in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, a 20-month global grounding, and ongoing production restrictions capped at 38 aircraft per month by the FAA. A 2024 incident involving the 737 MAX9 further disrupted recovery efforts. Airbus also faced setbacks, including defective engines, delayed deliveries, and supply chain issues, with leadership acknowledging 'persistent engine problems' as recently as July 2024. Despite these challenges, Airbus maintained steady delivery rates, enabling it to overtake Boeing. Boeing still holds 6,579 aircraft in its order book, valued at over $600 billion, and celebrated the delivery of its 2,000th 737 MAX to Ryanair in September. Airbus celebrates the achievement without boasting, as the aviation industry remains volatile, and Boeing is actively pursuing a recovery through enhanced quality controls and efforts to regain airline and passenger trust.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Journal du Geek](https://www.journaldugeek.com/?p=50577816)\n\n**FAA Allows Boeing to Increase 737 MAX Production Amid Safety and Financial Recovery Efforts**\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced on Friday, October 18, 2025, that it has authorized Boeing to increase production of its flagship 737 MAX aircraft to 42 units per month, up from 38 previously. This decision, reported by Reuters and AFP, marks a significant step forward for Boeing following safety concerns triggered by a January 2024 incident involving Alaska Airlines, where a missing door plug caused a cabin decompression at 16,000 feet (4,900 meters), revealing systemic production quality and safety flaws. The FAA conducted intensive safety reviews of Boeing\u2019s production lines and confirmed that its direct oversight of Boeing\u2019s operations remains unchanged. The FAA also allowed Boeing to issue self-certification for certain 737 MAX aircraft\u2014the first such authorization since 2019. Boeing stated it will increase production 'in a disciplined manner' while prioritizing 'safety and quality,' and expressed gratitude to its teams, suppliers, and the FAA. The company\u2019s stock rose 1.2% in after-hours trading. The production increase is critical for Boeing\u2019s financial recovery, as the company faces $53 billion in debt\u2014up from $12 billion in 2018\u2014and has reported annual losses over the past six years. Analysts expect continued losses in 2025 but anticipate profitability by 2026, the first since 2018. This milestone comes after the 2018 and 2019 crashes of two 737 MAX 8 aircraft that killed 346 people, leading to a global grounding and a major loss of market share. In October 2024, Airbus surpassed Boeing in deliveries, with its A320 family overtaking the 737 as the world\u2019s most delivered aircraft.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 11:24 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%84%D9%80%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%BA-%D8%A8%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-737-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B3)\n\n**After Two Years of Crises, U.S. Allows Boeing 737 MAX Production Increase**\nOn October 18, 2025, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved Boeing's request to increase production of the 737 MAX aircraft from a monthly maximum of 38 planes to an average of 42 per month. This decision follows a 2024 incident involving Alaska Airlines, where a door plug detached mid-flight, prompting a temporary grounding and heightened scrutiny. The FAA conducted intensive safety reviews of Boeing's production lines to ensure the increased output could be managed safely.

The incident exposed widespread production safety and quality lapses at Boeing. The FAA conducted extensive reviews of Boeing's production lines to ensure the increase is safe. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford personally confirmed the approval with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg. Boeing plans to ramp up production using newly added equipment at its Seattle-area factories, with workers preparing for the transition. The company emphasized its commitment to safety and quality, stating it appreciates the collaboration with its team, suppliers, and the FAA. Boeing's shares rose 1.2% in after-hours trading. Despite past production challenges, Boeing has strengthened its supply chain resilience by stockpiling $11 billion in raw materials\u2014up from $6.4 billion in 2018\u2014and building substantial inventories as a buffer against disruptions. However, the company remains heavily indebted, with $53 billion in debt compared to $12 billion in 2018. Wall Street analysts project Boeing will lose money again in 2025 but expects profitability by 2026, its first since 2018. The FAA had previously revoked Boeing\u2019s authority to issue airworthiness certificates for 737 MAX and 787 aircraft in 2019 and 2022, respectively, due to safety and quality issues. In September 2024, the FAA proposed a $3.1 million fine for hundreds of quality violations found at Boeing\u2019s Renton factory and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 Wichita facility between September 2023 and February 2024.

The delay follows certification challenges, with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg citing issues at the FAA, which has tightened oversight and no longer allows Boeing to self-certify planes as freely as before. Aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia noted the delay is largely due to external factors like FAA bandwidth constraints exacerbated by a government shutdown, not new technical problems. The delay has significant implications: it increases financial strain on Boeing, potentially triggering a $4 billion charge, erodes customer and investor trust, forces airlines to operate older, less efficient aircraft\u2014such as Emirates\u2019 Airbus A380\u2014and gives Airbus a continued edge in the long-haul market. The 777X, based on the 777-300ER but with larger size, new engines, and folding wingtips, was designed for operational consistency with the 787 Dreamliner to reduce pilot training and airport infrastructure costs. However, Boeing\u2019s history with the 737 Max, where design flaws led to two crashes, raises concerns about whether similar issues could emerge. Despite the setbacks, Emirates\u2019 President Tim Clark expressed cautious optimism about a 2027 delivery and praised Ortberg\u2019s determination. The 777X remains a critical part of Boeing\u2019s strategy to revive its reputation, especially as it is the only next-generation widebody in production. Meanwhile, Airbus\u2019s A350, with over 1,400 orders and 700 deliveries, has already outperformed the 777X in market share and delivery pace, receiving its first aircraft before the 777X.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 10:01 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-another-delay-boeing-new-777x-such-a-big-deal-2025-10)\n\n**Boeing Delays 777X Delivery to 2027 Amid Certification Backlog and Financial Strain**\nBoeing has delayed the delivery of its next-generation wide-body aircraft, the 777X, from 2026 to 2027, according to a report by Bloomberg on October 3, 2025. The delay is attributed to ongoing technical challenges and a heavy backlog of work required for certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Initially targeting a 2020 launch, the project has faced setbacks due to the 737 MAX crashes and the decline in air travel demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although CEO Kelly Ortberg stated in September 2025 that no new technical issues had emerged, he acknowledged that certification efforts remain a major hurdle. The first customer, Lufthansa of Germany, has also revised its plans, indicating it will not operate the 777X until 2027.

The firm is also projected to benefit from an estimated $10\u202fbillion net working\u2011capital gain driven by inventory reductions, potentially improving liquidity, though pre\u2011payments may offset some of this benefit.\n\nFree\u2011cash\u2011flow (FCF) forecasts were revised downward for 2026 by $1\u202fbillion due to 777X programme delays, yet the 2027\u201128 FCF outlook remains unchanged, signalling confidence in long\u2011term cash\u2011flow stability.\n\nBoeing\u2019s competitive landscape is dominated by a duopoly with Airbus in the large\u2011commercial aircraft market.  The MAX recovery is critical for competing in the narrow\u2011body segment, while the defence sector continues to provide a steady revenue stream amid rising global defence spending.\n\nWeaknesses highlighted include recent production delays, quality\u2011control issues, a negative 2025 EPS, ongoing 777X setbacks, reputational damage from MAX grounding, and elevated debt levels.  Opportunities lie in growing global air\u2011travel demand, increased defence contracts, service\u2011sector expansion, fuel\u2011efficient aircraft development, and autonomous/electric aviation technologies.\n\nThreats encompass intense Airbus competition, emerging rivals in China, heightened regulatory scrutiny, supply\u2011chain disruptions, raw\u2011material cost volatility, and geopolitical tensions affecting aircraft sales.\n\nAnalyst price targets for Boeing are consistently set at $255.00 for September\u202f2025 and $210.00 for July\u2011August\u202f2025, reflecting a bullish stance on the company\u2019s long\u2011term prospects.\n\nOverall, the article presents a data\u2011rich, analytical overview of Boeing\u2019s operational recovery, financial outlook, and strategic positioning, while acknowledging the risks that could impede sustained growth.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/swot-analysis/article-93CH-1253797)\n\n**Boeing: From Cultural Crisis to a Path of Recovery | Investing.com**\nBoeing is still navigating one of the deepest crises in its history, driven by a cultural shift away from engineering, safety lapses, and mounting debt. After the 737\u202fMAX door\u2011plug incident in January\u202f2024, the FAA capped production at ~38 jets per month until Boeing could demonstrate sustainable quality improvements. In August\u202f2024, Kelly Ortberg was appointed CEO; he quickly re\u2011aligned the commercial leadership team toward engineering and safety, restoring 737\u202fMAX output to the FAA\u2011imposed cap and stabilizing deliveries after years of disruptions. Boeing shares have rebounded more than 70\u202f% from their 2025 lows, reflecting renewed investor confidence. Management plans to resume share buybacks once free cash flow (FCF) improves, but the company still carries $45\u2011$50\u202fbillion in gross debt. FCF narrowed to a $0.2\u202fbillion loss in Q2\u202f2025 from a $4.3\u202fbillion loss in Q2\u202f2024, with operating cash flow turning slightly positive; however, sustainable positive FCF is not expected until 2026. The backlog is ~$619\u202fbillion, with ~6,500 commercial aircraft undelivered, most of them 737\u202fMAX, providing a multi\u2011year revenue buffer. Deliveries reached 48 aircraft in July\u202f2025, the highest July total since 2017, though monthly figures remain uneven due to supply\u2011chain and labor variability. Fitch revised Boeing\u2019s rating outlook to Stable, citing production improvements, financial flexibility, and a path to reduce gross debt below $50\u202fbillion by 2026. Key drivers for 2025\u20112026 include higher 737 output (potentially 42/month if the FAA lifts the cap), large backlog and new orders, defense contracts, and certification delays for MAX\u20117/10 and 777X. Risks include recurring quality lapses, labor disputes, and supply\u2011chain volatility. Technically, Boeing\u2019s stock (NYSE:\u202fBA) has shown a strong rebound of more than 70\u202f% from its 2025 lows, with a 50\u2011day moving average crossing above the 200\u2011day moving average\u2014a \u2018golden cross\u2019 that typically signals a bullish medium\u2011term outlook. RSI readings (~50\u201160) remain neutral to slightly bullish, suggesting the stock is not yet overbought. The article notes that a breakout above $242\u2011$245 could pave the way toward $255\u2011$260, while failure to clear this level risks a pullback toward support at $223\u2011$226. Overall, the piece presents a data\u2011driven analysis of Boeing\u2019s recovery path, highlighting both progress under Ortberg and the substantial risks that could derail the company\u2019s return to strength.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 07:17 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/boeing-from-cultural-crisis-to-a-path-of-recovery-200666718)\n\n**Is Boeing Stock Finally Ready for Takeoff After Years of Turbulence?**\nBoeing (BA) has faced significant challenges over the past six years, including two 737 MAX crashes, regulatory scrutiny, supply\u2011chain quality issues, a tarnished reputation, cash burn, and leadership changes. The company\u2019s financial and operational metrics have begun to improve: the stock, valued at $170.6\u202fbillion, has risen 27.8% this year, though it has returned only 28% over five years versus the market\u2019s 82%. In Q2 2025, Boeing delivered 150 commercial jets, and 280 were delivered in the first half of 2025, the highest since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg, who assumed the role in August 2024, said the recovery plan is \u2018taking hold\u2019 and that \u2018almost every customer\u2019 reports better\u2011quality deliveries. The 737 MAX is returning to a steady production rate of 38 aircraft per month, with plans to request FAA approval to ramp to 42 per month, while the 787 Dreamliner maintains a production rate of seven per month. Boeing Defense, Space & Security posted $6.6\u202fbillion in revenue, up 10% year\u2011over\u2011year, and the backlog now stands at $74\u202fbillion, driven by $19\u202fbillion in new orders. The June crash of Air India Flight 171, a 787\u20118, remains a reminder that safety incidents can still impact investor sentiment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 10:13 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The results highlighted Boeing's efforts to cautiously increase monthly production this year, after years of quality problems and delays in producing its flagship 737 MAX. The increase in deliveries represents a crucial step in Boeing's efforts to recover from years of production interruptions and crises that have accumulated debt, increasing the urgency to accelerate production to restore financial stability. However, the improvement in the company's financial performance was overshadowed by the announcement that certification of the new 777-9 and 737 MAX 7 and 10 models will not occur until 2026, another setback for these programs. Boeing is still developing solutions to resolve problems with the engine icing systems of the 737 MAX, which are delaying certification, saying it is 'a bit more complicated' than expected, said Boeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg to CNBC. During the interview, he praised the aggressive use of tariffs by President Donald Trump to close trade agreements. 'I like the way this tariff situation is unfolding,' said Ortberg to CNBC. 'It's good for our business, it's good for the aerospace industry, and it will create jobs in the United States.' The US and EU agreed to exempt aircraft and aviation parts from tariffs. However, raw materials such as steel and aluminum continue to be subject to high tariffs. The company reported a basic adjusted loss per share of $1.24 for the quarter ending June, compared to a loss of $2.90 per share in the previous year. Analysts had expected a loss of $1.48 per share. The use of Boeing's free cash flow, an important metric for Wall Street, was better than expected, signaling an improvement in the company's cash position.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 04:50 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/boeing-diminui-prejuizo-trimestral-com-recuperacao-das-entregas-de-jatos,1eff38c56d8243aa0803a15c100467855bmugzfx.html)\n\n**Boeing's Quarterly Loss Reduced, Deliveries Increase Amid Regulatory Crisis**\nBoeing's quarterly loss was reduced by more than half and was significantly lower than expected, as the US aircraft manufacturer increased its deliveries, recovering from a regulatory crisis and a significant strike that halted much of the production last year. Boeing's shares fell 2% in early trading on Tuesday. The results highlighted the company's efforts to cautiously increase monthly production this year, after years of quality problems and delays in manufacturing its flagship aircraft, the 737 MAX. The increase in deliveries represents a crucial step in Boeing's attempt to overcome years of interruptions and production crises that have accumulated debt, increasing the urgency to accelerate production to restore financial stability. Financial improvements were overshadowed by the announcement that certification of new models 777-9, 737 MAX 7 and 737 MAX 10 will not be finalized until 2026, which represents a new setback for these programs. The company had previously anticipated that it expected to complete certification by the end of this year. Boeing is still developing solutions to address several persistent problems that delay certifications, said CEO Kelly Ortberg. During the interview, Ortberg praised the aggressive use of tariffs by former President Donald Trump to negotiate trade agreements. 'I like how this tariff situation is developing,' he told CNBC. 'It's good for our business, good for the aerospace industry, and will generate jobs in the United States.' The manufacturer reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.24 in the quarter ended in June, compared to a loss of $2.90 a year earlier. Analysts had expected a loss of $1.48 per share. The free cash flow, a key metric for Wall Street, was better than expected, reflecting an improvement in the company's financial position. 'As we continue to execute our Safety and Quality Plan, there is more stability in our operations,' Ortberg said in a letter to Boeing employees. In May, the company produced 38 737 aircraft, and production has remained stable since then, according to the company. 'We plan to request FAA approval to increase production to a rate of 42 units per month when our key performance indicators (KPIs) show that we are ready,' added Ortberg. During the first half of the year, Boeing delivered 206 737 MAX aircraft, compared to 135 in the same period last year. In total, the company delivered 285 commercial aircraft by June, compared to 175 in the same period of 2024. Deliveries are closely monitored by Wall Street, as manufacturers receive the majority of the payment when delivering the aircraft to customers. Boeing also increased production of the 787 model at its Charleston, South Carolina plant from five to seven units per month. During the first half of the year, the company recorded 668 orders, or 625 net orders after cancellations and conversions. According to data compiled by LSEG, Boeing recorded a free cash flow of $200 million in the second quarter, compared to analyst expectations of $1.720 million. In contrast, the company had burned $2.300 million in free cash flow during the previous quarter and $4.330 million during the second quarter of 2024. Its defense, space and security division reported an operating profit of $110 million, compared to a loss of $913 million recorded a year earlier. The company's quarterly revenue increased 35%, reaching $22.750 million, exceeding analyst estimates of $21.840 million.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 04:09 PM\nSource:[Forbes M\u00e9xico](https://forbes.com.mx/acciones-de-boeing-caen-pese-a-reduccion-de-perdidas-trimestrales-tras-repunte-de-entrega-de-aviones/)\n\n**Boeing Reports Smaller Loss Due to Increased Production and Deliveries**\nBoeing reported a smaller loss for the second quarter due to increased production and deliveries of jets. The company is recovering from a regulatory crisis and a large strike that halted most production lines last year. Boeing's shares rose 1.5% in pre-market trading. The company has increased monthly production of the 737 MAX to 38 units in May, and CEO Kelly Ortberg stated, 'While we continue to implement our safety and quality plan, there is more stability in our processes.' Boeing plans to request FAA approval to increase production to 42 units per month once key performance indicators (KPIs) show they are ready. The company has delivered 206 737 MAX jets by mid-year, with delivery numbers closely watched on Wall Street as aircraft manufacturers receive a significant portion of their payments when they hand over the planes to customers. Boeing has also increased production of the 787 in its Charleston, South Carolina plant from five to seven units per month. In the first half of the year, Boeing booked 668 orders, or 625 net orders after cancellations and conversions. The improvement in deliveries marks a crucial step in Boeing's efforts to recover from years of production disruptions and crises that have caused high debt. This highlights the urgency to accelerate production to restore financial stability. In the quarter ending June, the manufacturer reported a net loss of $612 million, or 92 cents per share, compared to $1.44 billion, or $2.33 per share, in the same period last year. However, Boeing remains under pressure from supply chain disruptions that delay production and limit the company's ability to meet growing demand in the aviation industry. In 2024, the company reported a loss of nearly $12 billion due to challenges in its main business areas, including burdens in the defense segment. Additionally, Boeing is affected by the far-reaching US tariffs under President Donald Trump, which increase part costs and could further strain the already fragile supply chain. Boeing's revenue rose 35% to $22.75 billion in the quarter ending June.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 11:48 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/boeing-verzeichnet-geringeren-verlust-dank-gestiegener-auslieferungen-ce7c5fd9de8df420)\n\n**Aircraft Delivery Delays: A Global Supply Chain Crisis**\nThe delivery period of aircraft has been increasing, with the average delivery time being around 6 years. This is due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the supply chain, which has not fully recovered. As a result, airlines are struggling to obtain new aircraft, leading to delays in expanding new routes. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global aircraft backlog has increased by 1.7 times compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, reaching 17,000 units. IATA predicts that it will take 14 years to clear the backlog, and that new orders may not be delivered until 20 years from now. The IATA has also lowered its forecast for airline profits this year to $36.6 billion, down from $36.6 billion. The delay in aircraft delivery is due to a combination of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the supply chain, the war in Ukraine, and the recent Boeing strike. Domestic airlines are also affected, with Korean Air delaying the delivery of 30 Boeing aircraft to 2027 and Asiana Airlines delaying the delivery of 30 Airbus aircraft to 2031. Jeju Air expects to receive its 40 Boeing aircraft in 2029, but is currently operating with older aircraft due to the supply shortage. The airline industry is facing significant financial burdens, with aircraft rental costs increasing by 30% compared to 2019. An industry official stated, 'We are concerned that the delay in aircraft delivery will affect our plans to launch new routes.' The US's recent announcement of a 7% tariff on aircraft parts is expected to further exacerbate the supply chain issues. The industry is bracing for the impact of the tariff, with some companies warning of potential disruptions to their supply chains. 'This issue is very important for Korean Air,' said Cho Won-tae, chairman of the Hanjin Group, at the IATA annual meeting on June 2. 'The tariff will cause significant disruption to our business activities.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 30, 2025 07:10 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025063078191)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasting experts from diverse backgrounds (accounting, finance, law, aerospace industry analysis, and business strategy) overwhelmingly assess the probability that Boeing will file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2026 as very low, typically ranging from 2% to 7%. \n\nKey common factors for a low probability include: Boeing\u2019s systemically important position in the global aerospace industry, its immense commercial and defense order backlog (> $600B), recent regulatory milestones (notably FAA approval to increase 737 MAX production), improving operational/cash flow trends, continued access to credit and institutional investor support, and historical precedent for government or market intervention rather than bankruptcy for firms of similar scale and importance. While all analysts acknowledge persistent distress signals\u2014most notably high and unsustainable debt ($53B), negative profitability since 2018, an Altman Z-Score in the distress zone, ongoing legal scrutiny, and delays in key programs (especially the 777X)\u2014these are balanced out by positive momentum in operational recovery, reduced cash burn, strong market/analyst sentiment, and the immense economic/strategic incentive to avoid insolvency proceedings.\n\nAll forecasters stipulate that bankruptcy is not impossible: the main risk comes from unforeseeable, severe shocks (such as a catastrophic safety/quality event, a sudden legal or regulatory calamity, or a credit market freeze that blocks needed refinancing), rather than any visible, current deterioration. In the absence of such a black swan event, the consensus view is that Boeing will avoid bankruptcy filings before the question\u2019s close, relying instead on operational adjustments, stakeholder patience, possible out-of-court workouts, and, if necessary, extraordinary government or capital market support.",
