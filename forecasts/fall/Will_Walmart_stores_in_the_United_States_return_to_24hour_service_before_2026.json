From an organizational sociology standpoint, institutional isomorphism, cost control, labor pressures, and changing social norms have all solidified this arrangement. There is no evidence of any countervailing pressure (from labor markets, consumers, competitors, or regulators) that would plausibly force a reversal in the next 13 months. The only scenarios for a 'Yes' are highly unlikely and would require major, currently unforeseeable shifts. Thus, I assess the probability as extremely low, close to 0%.",

Even historic disaster responses only yielded temporary, local exceptions\u2014never a corporate-wide, immediate reversion. Your 2% feels like an academic hedge rather than a probability grounded in the extreme lock-in we have here: the inertia isn\u2019t theoretical; it\u2019s five years reinforced by every peer, every announcement, every practical reality.

Prior to 2020, Walmart stores were known for being open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in most locations. However, COVID-19 and related government restrictions resulted in the company's management making the decision to close stores at night. In August of 2022, the chain announced that they had [no plans](https://www.wsfa.com/2022/08/12/walmart-no-plans-make-stores-247-again/) to make its stores open 24/7 again, likely as a result of [labor shortages](https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/understanding-americas-labor-shortage-the-most-impacted-industries). However, this has not stopped [speculation](https://www.cheddarflow.com/blog/the-end-of-24-hour-walmart-what-happened/) that the chain may return to 24-hour service at some point as labor shortages recede.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":20241,\"question_id\":20241}}`",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 300 points, or 0.84%, closing at 45,752.26. The S&P 500 dropped 1.55% to 6,538.97, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.15% to 22,078.05. Although indices opened higher following strong earnings from chipmaker Nvidia and positive September employment data, they turned negative during the day. September non-farm employment rose by 119,000, exceeding expectations, but the unemployment rate increased from 4.3% to 4.4%. Initial jobless claims fell by 8,000 to 220,000 for the week ending November 15. Analysts noted that the strong employment data, which surpassed expectations, was the final report before the December 9\u201310 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, and that more recent data would be released afterward, reinforcing expectations that the Fed would likely hold rates steady. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the October employment report would not be released due to data collection disruptions during the government shutdown, and the November report\u2014originally planned for December 5\u2014was rescheduled to December 16. Federal Reserve officials also weighed in: Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack emphasized the need for a measured, mildly restrictive policy to reach the 2% inflation target. Fed Governor Michael Barr expressed concern that inflation remains around 3%, stating the 2% target remains a firm commitment. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that inflation progress may have stalled and could reverse, calling it unsettling. Nvidia\u2019s financial results, released after market close, showed revenue rose 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the quarter, surpassing market expectations. The company also raised its guidance for the current quarter to $65 billion. Despite a more than 4% gain at the start of the day, Nvidia shares ended the session down 2.9%. Walmart shares surged 6.5% after reporting third-quarter revenue and earnings above expectations and raising its full-year sales forecast.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[D\u00fcnya](https://www.dunya.com/finans/haberler/new-york-borsasi-dususle-kapandi-haberi-803965)\n\n**Thanksgiving Grocery, Black Friday Retail Hours: What's Open, Closed In MI**\nOn Thanksgiving Day, several major retail stores in Michigan, including Academy Sports + Outdoors, Apple, Army & Air Force Exchange Service, Ashley HomeStore, Banana Republic, Foot Locker, and others, were closed.

Major grocery chains such as Kroger and Albertsons have similarly made their pandemic\u2011era reduced hours permanent, with most stores closing at 10 or 11\u202fp.m.  Pharmacy chains Walgreens and CVS have cut hours at many former 24/7 sites because a nationwide shortage of pharmacists makes overnight operation unsafe.  National banks like Chase and Bank of America now often close their lobbies at 4 or 5\u202fp.m. instead of 6\u202fp.m. and have eliminated many Saturday hours, encouraging customers to use ATMs or online banking.  Fast\u2011food chains such as McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell have allowed franchise owners to shorten hours, and some 24/7 drive\u2011thrus have closed entirely.  Department stores including Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, once open until 10\u202fp.m. on weeknights, now typically close at 8 or 9\u202fp.m., reflecting a decline in evening foot traffic.  Home improvement giants Home\u202fDepot and Lowe\u2019s, which used to stay open until 10\u202fp.m., now frequently close at 9\u202fp.m.  The article attributes these shifts to a tight labor market and a major move toward online shopping, making the old 24/7 model unprofitable for most businesses.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts, drawing from distinct disciplinary perspectives (including retail operations, store staffing, labor markets, corporate strategic planning, business administration, economics, and sociology), are nearly unanimous in their conclusion: it is extremely unlikely that a majority of Walmart stores in the United States will return to 24-hour service before January 1, 2026. The experts cite a shared set of powerful, converging factors: persistent labor shortages and higher wage costs (especially for overnight shifts), permanent shifts in consumer behavior (with demand for late-night in-person shopping diminished and e-commerce ascendant), sector-wide normalization of shorter store hours, continued profitability and operational efficiency with reduced hours, and Walmart's extensive public communication emphasizing employee welfare and satisfaction with the status quo. No credible recent news or corporate signals indicate any impending shift, and industry precedent is that no retailer has reversed pandemic-era hour reductions at scale. The base rate for such a large-scale, rapid operational reversal is assessed as effectively zero. Black swan events (such as a radical improvement in labor supply or disruptive competitive shock) are mentioned only as extremely remote possibilities, with no current evidence supporting them. Consequently, all experts (with the exception of one giving a minuscule '2%' due to sociological unpredictability) assign a final probability of 1% or, functionally, near-zero to Walmart resuming 24/7 operations nationwide in the current timeframe. Their reasoning collectively emphasizes the entrenched, self-reinforcing nature of the shorter-hours model and the absence of catalysts for change.",
