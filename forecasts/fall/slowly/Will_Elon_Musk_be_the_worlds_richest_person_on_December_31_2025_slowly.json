While tech valuations are volatile and have shown susceptibility to political risks (e.g., tariffs), historical base rates indicate that such large leads are rarely overcome in short timeframes without major, company-specific catastrophes or a rival\u2019s asset ballooning unexpectedly. The September incident with Ellison highlights that temporary overtakes are possible but generally short-lived and require exceptional, compounding surges. Tesla\u2019s and SpaceX\u2019s resource bases\u2014technology, market access, brand, and proprietary data\u2014are difficult for competitors to match or surpass in the near term. Musk\u2019s recent consolidation of Tesla shares and the new compensation package increase his alignment with shareholder value, reducing the odds of self-dilution. The most credible threats (Ellison, Zuckerberg) would need to sustain extraordinary growth while Tesla suffers a material and lasting decline, which is not strongly indicated in the current news cycle. With less than three months to go, and given the size of Musk\u2019s lead and the RBV logic of sustainable advantage, the probability of Musk being dethroned by year-end is quite low but not impossible, especially with ongoing market volatility. Therefore, an aggressive but justified probability, reflecting the persistence of the status quo and the magnitude of Musk\u2019s advantage, is warranted.",
