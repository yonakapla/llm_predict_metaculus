Macro shocks\u2014like the recent Trump-China tariffs\u2014do introduce significant downside risk, but these tend to affect all top tech billionaires in parallel, making a reshuffling less likely unless one company experiences an idiosyncratic disaster or a rival\u2019s holdings experience an unexpected surge. While another Oracle-like event is possible, it would require both a Tesla crash and a rival\u2019s meteoric rise to overtake Musk.

The September spike in Ellison's wealth proved short-lived, and the base rate for billionaire rank changes suggests persistence once a clear lead exists. However, events like the recent US-China tariff escalation highlight downside risk, and Ellison has shown the capacity to overtake Musk, albeit briefly. Given the short time remaining (2.5 months), the large current lead, and the lack of an imminent competitive threat, the status quo strongly favors Musk.

While Ellison briefly overtook Musk in September, the reversal was fast, and the overall market context (AI enthusiasm, tech dominance) favors Musk\u2019s asset mix through year-end. My equity valuation perspective emphasizes that, for a single day like December 31, a sudden market shock could matter, but absent a black swan, Musk\u2019s diversified tech empire\u2014bolstered by new compensation, strong Tesla and SpaceX performance, and limited credible threats from rivals\u2014makes him the overwhelming favorite.
