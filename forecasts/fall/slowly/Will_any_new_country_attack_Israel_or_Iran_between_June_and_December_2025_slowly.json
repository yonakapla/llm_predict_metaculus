The most likely candidates for direct intervention\u2014Syria, Lebanon, Yemen\u2014remain deterred by overwhelming Israeli/US military superiority and the threat of devastating retaliation. The fine print of the question sets a high bar for what counts as an 'attack,' ruling out covert or ambiguous operations and requiring either official acknowledgment or unambiguous attribution. While tensions are high and the ceasefire is fragile, and while a miscalculation or major provocation could, in theory, push a state over the threshold, the probability remains low. I weight the status quo and base rates heavily, but adjust upward slightly given the exceptional instability and the precedent of US direct strikes (which could, in turn, provoke a desperate or emboldened actor). Overall, the probability that a new country will overtly attack Israel or Iran before January 1, 2026, is low but non-negligible.",

This could result from an Israeli or Iranian strike on their territory, a miscalculation, or extreme domestic pressure.

The region's norm is proxy action and rhetorical escalation, not direct state-to-state attacks, due to the risk of massive retaliation and international blowback. The fine print further stipulates that covert or ambiguous operations do not count unless officially acknowledged or credibly attributed, raising the bar for a 'Yes' resolution. The current environment is highly volatile, but the high cost of direct involvement, overwhelming US and Israeli deterrent capability, and the lack of recent precedent for direct state attacks by others suggest the probability remains low. The main plausible path to 'Yes' is accidental escalation or extreme domestic instability in a frontline state (e.g., Lebanon, Syria, Iraq), but these are low-probability, high-impact scenarios. Given all these factors, and with nearly three months left in the forecast window, I assess the probability of a new country attacking Israel or Iran as low, but not negligible due to the extraordinary situation.",
