The only plausible paths to a 'Yes' are either an accident/miscalculation (e.g., Israeli strike kills Syrian or Iraqi officials on their own soil, prompting direct retaliation), or a dramatic escalation if Israel or the US strikes Iranian assets in a way that drags in an allied government. However, the deterrent effect of visible US involvement, combined with historical patterns of restraint, makes the 'No' scenario much more likely.

The most significant recent escalations (the June 2025 Israel-Iran-US war) did not result in direct third-party state entry, despite attacks on US bases in Qatar and Israeli strikes in Lebanon/Syria. Regional actors have strong incentives to avoid direct confrontation, particularly with the US now overtly involved and deterrence highly salient. Historical precedent, balance of power logic, and the post-ceasefire environment all weigh heavily toward restraint. However, the unprecedented nature of recent events, some accidental spillover (e.g., Israeli attacks on Qatari territory), and the volatility of the situation marginally increase the risk above peacetime baselines. The most plausible pathways to a Yes involve miscalculation, domestic instability, or regime desperation in a bordering state. On balance, the probability should be somewhat higher than the long-term base rate (sub-5%), but still relatively low given ongoing deterrence and the risks of escalation. I assess the probability at 8%.",

The question resolves NO.",

The current situation is highly escalatory, with the US having intervened directly, but historically, regional states have shown strong aversion to entering open war with either Iran or Israel due to the catastrophic risks involved. All major regional actors have much to lose from direct involvement and have effective alternatives in proxy warfare, covert action, and diplomacy. The current ceasefire and ongoing posturing suggest a return to deterrence rather than expansion. While the risk of miscalculation or a black swan event is elevated, it remains below the threshold needed to justify a high probability, especially over a 2.5-month window. Given RSCT's focus on security interdependence and the high cost/low benefit calculus for new state actors, the chance of a new country attacking Israel or Iran before January 2026 is low but not negligible.",

The unprecedented level of violence in the June 2025 conflict, including US direct strikes, has heightened regional and global risk aversion to further escalation. While there are heightened tensions, regional actors have signaled strong preferences for restraint and diplomacy, often relying on proxies for deniability. The fine print excludes proxy and covert attacks unless overtly claimed, further lowering the chance of a 'Yes' resolution. Qatar, while affected, is highly unlikely to retaliate militarily. Saudi Arabia and UAE have strong incentives not to escalate, particularly with US presence and economic considerations. The only plausible paths to a 'Yes' involve significant miscalculation or accidental escalation, which, while never zero, is historically rare. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that no new country attacks Israel or Iran between June and December 2025.",
