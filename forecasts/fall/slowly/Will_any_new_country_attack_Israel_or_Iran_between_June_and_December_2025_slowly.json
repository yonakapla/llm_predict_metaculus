The current deterrence environment is extremely robust: Israel and Iran have both demonstrated willingness and ability to inflict severe punishment, and US involvement further raises the cost for potential new attackers. The threat of uncontrollable escalation\u2014possibly nuclear\u2014acts as a further disincentive. Domestic political and economic constraints in neighboring states are also a powerful brake.

RSCT suggests that the current structure\u2014despite elevated hostilities\u2014discourages new direct entrants due to (1) severe deterrence from the US/Israel and Iranian retaliation, (2) regional states' fear of sparking uncontrollable escalation, and (3) strong norms of plausible deniability. The news supports this: while tensions remain high, rhetoric from Iran and Israel is focused on deterrence, not expansion, and most regional actors remain on high alert but inactive. The only plausible 'Yes' scenarios involve either an accidental, misattributed incident or a rogue action explicitly claimed by a state, but these are historically rare and would likely be quickly disavowed. The time window is short (2.5 months), and the political costs for any new regional actor are prohibitive. Thus, the status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome.",

Alternatively, an attack on a high-value religious or civilian target catalyzes direct state military response, or an 'accidental' incursion leads to open hostilities and is claimed by the state under domestic or alliance pressure.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates strongly favor the status quo: since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, no regional state has directly attacked Israel, and direct interstate attacks on Iran by regional states have also been extremely rare. The current war saw only the US join Israel in direct kinetic action, with other states exercising extreme caution. The news highlights both readiness and deterrence, with Iran and Israel threatening devastating retaliation for any further attacks. The explicit U.S. presence and threat posture in the region act as a further brake on state action. Regional actors have every incentive to avoid escalation, preferring deniability and proxy warfare, as evidenced by decades of precedent. While the conflict is at its most volatile in decades, and the risk of miscalculation is nonzero, the threshold for direct state intervention is extremely high and has not been crossed even at the peak of recent hostilities. The most plausible risk\u2014Qatari or Gulf Arab retaliation for direct attacks on their territory\u2014has so far been managed with restraint, and neither Russia nor China have incentives to intervene directly. Given these factors, I judge the likelihood of a new country attacking Israel or Iran between now and the end of December 2025 to be low, but not zero, mainly due to the unprecedented volatility and the potential for accidental escalation.",
