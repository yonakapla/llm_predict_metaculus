The boycott or non-participation of major parties and the traditional use of electoral management to inflate margins point toward a very high official result. With only five approved candidates, none with party machinery comparable to RHDP, a vote share above 80% is highly probable. The main limiting factor would be deliberate moderation for appearance's sake or a previously unseen surge for a minor candidate\u2014not strongly signaled in current reporting. Risks of violence/disruption exist but are not currently acute.

In 2020, amid partial boycott and violence, Ouattara received 94.3% in the official tally\u2014but this is best interpreted as the ceiling in a maximal suppression scenario. In 2015 (with partial participation and some real opposition), he scored 83.7%. In 2025, the field is even weaker: Both major opposition candidates are barred, and Gbagbo's camp will not endorse any candidate\u2014likely depressing opposition turnout, further demobilizing anti-regime voters, and reducing the legitimacy of minor candidates. However, ethnic voting patterns\u2014especially in the west and south\u2014means that even with regime control, turnout and protest votes may prevent as massive a landslide as in 2020. Spoiled ballots and regional abstention could blunt the regime's total, but the likelihood of the government massaging reported results remains high. Given these dynamics, and the tendency for semi-authoritarian regimes to prefer the legitimating power of overwhelming but not 'Soviet-style' margins, the probability sits just below even odds, but higher than a truly competitive environment would allow. The regime certainly wants an emphatic win, but reaching 80% (among valid votes) depends on both the maintenance of opposition demobilization and the absence of mass protest voting in opposition strongholds. On balance, with the status quo and current information, the chance Ouattara receives 80% or more in the official first-round results is about 63%.",

C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's politics are deeply influenced by such cleavages, including the north-south (Muslim-Christian) split, ethnic group rivalries, and issues of exclusion vs inclusion. Social cleavages affect both regime legitimation and the nature of electoral competition: if cleavages are suppressed, electoral victories can be artificially inflated; if they manifest as opposition, they create space for more competitive elections despite authoritarian constraints.",
            "status_quo": "In the 2020 presidential election, Ouattara officially won 94.27% of the vote in a contest marred by an opposition boycott. In 2015, he won 83.66% in a more competitive, but still uneven, race. In 2010, the outcome was far closer (with runoff, not relevant for this round-question). Thus, the base rate for an incumbent in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire winning over 80% has occurred when major opposition forces are excluded or boycott, but not in more competitive contests.",

            "yes_scenario": "With leading rivals disqualified and opposition parties divided, most non-Ouattara voters abstain or spoil their ballots. Remaining opponents lack national structures or funding. State administrative apparatus mobilizes supporter turnout with high efficiency, while suppressing dissent in difficult regions. Official results are tallied under strongly controlled conditions, producing an official tally comfortably over 80% for Ouattara (e.g., 85\u201390%), echoing the 2020 pattern.",
            "final_reasoning": "Social cleavages in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire typically structure elections, but the regime has systematically neutralized their role by sidelining and fragmenting the opposition, exploiting legal and administrative levers, and shaping voter choice to a non-competitive contest. The exclusion of all formidable opposition (Gbagbo, Thiam, and allies), absence of a unifying anti-regime campaign, and a proven record of engineered, high-margin victories weigh strongly toward an official result exceeding the 80% threshold. However, slight downward pressure stems from the regime's potential desire to avoid margins so high as to kill legitimacy or from localized abstention/protest effects, but these countervailing forces are much weaker than the incentives and mechanisms to fabricate or encourage a landslide. Thus, the base rate (2020 = 94.27%, 2015 = 83.7%) and current configuration justify a high degree of confidence, well above 80%. Accordingly, I forecast this outcome is highly likely.",
