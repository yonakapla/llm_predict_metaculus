The biggest risk factors are last-minute breakdowns over sequencing, continued Israeli military action, or changes in leadership positions. Given the short timeline (2.5 months), the risk of breakdown is nontrivial, but the momentum of the current agreement, especially with both sides seeking a face-saving exit, makes a full hostage release (as defined by Hamas\u2019s statement) more likely than not.
