The current deal is more robust, with stronger international backing and clear mutual incentives, and the humanitarian/political pressure is at a peak. However, major issues remain unresolved (disarmament, governance, guarantees), and both sides have incentives and capabilities to walk away or slow-roll implementation if they perceive the other side as cheating. The presence of spoilers on both sides and the requirement for phased, conditional steps increase the risk of breakdown. Track Two channels and active mediation do provide an additional buffer against collapse, but do not eliminate the risk. Given these factors and the short time frame until January 1, 2026, the scenario of all hostages being released is more likely than at any previous point, but far from certain.

However, major structural obstacles remain: the absence of agreement on disarmament and governance, deep distrust, and volatile domestic politics on both sides. There is significant risk of slippage or collapse (as seen in previous partial deals), especially if military actions resume or political spoilers intervene. Nonetheless, the base rate for partial hostage deals in this conflict is high, and the short time window increases the likelihood that, at least for a brief period, Hamas will have no living hostages under its control.

The explicit commitment to release all hostages and the detailed sequencing (hostages within 72 hours of Israeli approval) are promising. Still, significant risks remain: unresolved issues about disarmament, Israeli withdrawal, and governance could derail implementation; both sides have domestic spoilers; and logistical/operational risks for the transfer itself are non-trivial. Given the short time window (2.5 months), the strong incentives for rapid implementation, and the acute international visibility, I assess a higher probability than the base rate, but not near certainty\u2014there remains a material risk of last-minute collapse or the retention of even a single hostage for leverage.
