The main risk is that the deal will collapse over implementation details (e.g., timing of Israeli withdrawal, disputes over disarmament, or Hamas's security guarantees) or that the process will be drawn out past December 31, 2025. The fact that both sides are already publicly committed and that the US is highly invested increases the probability somewhat, but the history of failed ceasefires and the high remaining leverage value of the hostages means the risk of last-minute collapse is real. The resolution depends on Hamas's declaration; if Hamas claims no hostages are left\u2014even with ambiguity or incomplete verification\u2014the question resolves Yes.

The risk of last-minute collapse, sabotage by spoilers, or technical inability to deliver all living hostages (due to deaths, chaos, or misinformation) remains significant. Still, the current alignment of international actors, the clarity of the ultimatum, and the phased but explicit plan increase the odds above base rate.

The base rate for full, timely hostage release in similar conflicts is low, especially when deals are multi-phased and contentious.

The most significant risks are (a) disputes over implementation sequence (hostages for withdrawal), (b) internal spoilers, and (c) the possibility that Hamas withholds a hostage as leverage for future phases. Nevertheless, the public commitments, strong mediation, and mutual exhaustion increase the likelihood of at least the initial hostage release phase being completed as described.
