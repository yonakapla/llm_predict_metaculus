However, Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology are not explicitly exempt and are more dependent on US largesse, with Samsung already receiving substantial CHIPS Act funding and facing sectoral uncertainty. The administration\u2019s desire for political wins, the precedent of equity stakes, and the lack of public resistance from these companies (likely due to fear of adverse subsidy reviews) suggest that a deal with at least one of these companies is plausible within the timeframe. Legal challenges may slow but are less likely to fully block such moves, given the administration\u2019s assertiveness and the precedent set by the Intel stake. Weighing all factors\u2014especially the administration\u2019s aggressive posture, political incentives, ongoing negotiations, and lack of explicit exemptions for Samsung, Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology\u2014I estimate a moderately high probability that the US government will acquire stock in at least one of these companies before the end of 2025.",

The risk is further increased by the administration's desire for tangible industrial policy victories and its apparent willingness to countenance legal disputes or even subsidy clawbacks in pursuit of equity. On the other hand, the legal and diplomatic barriers, the risk of companies returning subsidies, and the possibility that no new deals are concluded before year's end all weigh on the No side.

Samsung's U.S. subsidiary is a more plausible target, but so far, its U.S. investments appear to meet the threshold for exemption, and the broader climate of industry resistance and legal uncertainty acts as a brake. Still, the administration's selective, opportunistic approach leaves the door open to targeting Global Foundries or Microchip Technology, especially if bureaucratic infighting or desire for a 'win' overcomes industry pushback or legal concerns. The base rate for such intervention is low, but the political context is highly abnormal.

However, the current administration has already broken precedent with Intel (and MP Materials), and actively seeks additional high-profile deals before the midterms. Explicit carve-outs for TSMC and Micron lower the probability for those companies, but Samsung (and potentially Global Foundries, Microchip Technology) remain in the crosshairs. The administration's need for political wins, the aggressive policy posture, and the lack of explicit exemption for Samsung tip the odds upward. However, significant legal, diplomatic, and market risks, coupled with potential corporate pushback (e.g., threat to return subsidies), moderate the likelihood. Overall, I judge the probability as higher than the status quo base rate for such interventions, but not overwhelming\u2014Samsung is the most likely target, but the probability remains well below certainty due to the outlined constraints.",

This is announced and completed before January 1, 2026, as part of a broader public campaign to demonstrate industrial policy results before the midterms. The deal may be justified as a quid pro quo for continued or increased subsidies and is publicized as a win for US taxpayers.",
            "final_reasoning": "The key to this forecast is the clear shift in Trump administration policy toward direct equity stakes in strategic companies, as evidenced by the Intel deal and repeated public statements. While TSMC and Micron are explicitly exempted (consistent across multiple official statements and news reports), Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology remain plausible targets\u2014especially since Samsung received major subsidies and is less politically shielded than TSMC. The administration has a strong political incentive to secure further deals before the 2026 midterms, and the Intel precedent lowers the political and operational barriers to at least one more deal. Legal and bureaucratic obstacles pose some risk, but the administration's demonstrated willingness to act unilaterally and flexibly (as with the Natcast fund cancellation) suggests they will find a way to structure at least one equity acquisition. Corporate pushback may moderate the size or terms, but is unlikely to block all deals, especially among US-headquartered or more dependent firms. The base rate for government equity in major US firms is low, but the specific context (recent Intel deal, midterm pressure, strategic urgency) justifies a higher-than-default probability. Therefore, the probability is well above 50%, but not near certainty due to legal and corporate friction.",
