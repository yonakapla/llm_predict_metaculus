Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology, however, have not received such explicit exemptions. Samsung in particular is a plausible target: it has received large subsidies, is not US-headquartered, and faces a political climate where the administration is eager for deals in critical sectors. The administration\u2019s desire for clear, symbolic victories ahead of midterms creates real pressure to deliver another equity stake. However, the risk of legal or process delays, and the possibility of companies resisting by threatening to repay subsidies or delay investments, reduces the likelihood of a deal closing before year-end. Considering all factors, the probability is meaningfully elevated compared to the historical norm, but less than even odds due to strong carve-outs for TSMC/Micron, legal/industry headwinds, and the short timeline.

However, TSMC and Micron appear robustly exempted due to their large investments and strategic leverage. Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology remain plausible targets, with Samsung's US projects under particular scrutiny due to the administration\u2019s skepticism about foreign control and previous antagonism toward South Korean firms in trade policy contexts. The policy climate is one of uncertainty and fear, with companies reluctant to publicly confront the administration. Political incentives to secure another 'victory' before the year's end are strong, and the administration has already shown a willingness to use surprise, rapid policy shifts. On the other hand, legal and operational hurdles, as well as possible behind-the-scenes company resistance, could delay or derail new equity deals in the remaining three months. Historically, such interventions are rare outside acute crises, but the current environment is already highly interventionist. Weighing all factors, especially the administration's demonstrated intent, the lack of categorical denials for Samsung, Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology, and the strong incentive for at least one more high-profile deal before the holidays and midterms ramp up, I assess the likelihood as moderately high but not overwhelming.",

This narrows the field to Samsung (and its US subsidiaries), Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology. The administration is under pressure to announce more deals ahead of the midterms, but the public signals, legal ambiguity, and potential for corporate resistance mean the path is not clear. Samsung is the most plausible target (with $4.7B in subsidies and a $37B US investment plan), but the cancellation of the Natcast fund and broader industry uncertainty suggest the administration may refrain from further destabilizing the sector. The most likely scenario is continued saber-rattling, pressure, and perhaps new profit-sharing or tariff-based arrangements, but not an outright equity deal in the listed firms before year-end. Given these considerations and the weight of consistent, on-record denials for TSMC/Micron and no public evidence of advanced equity talks with Samsung/Global Foundries/Microchip Technology, the probability is above base rate due to political incentives and precedents, but still modest.",

            "no_scenario": "Despite political pressure and the policy shift, the US government does not acquire any stock in Micron, TSMC, Samsung (or its subsidiaries), Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology before the end of 2025. This could occur because targeted companies accelerate US investment, agree to alternative terms (profit-sharing, guarantees), or successfully resist government attempts, possibly returning subsidies or leveraging political and legal resistance. The administration might focus on other sectors or on companies outside the designated list, or simply not finalize any equity deal in time.",
            "yes_scenario": "The administration, seeking a midterm victory and/or to demonstrate strategic resolve, finalizes an equity deal with at least one company on the list\u2014most plausibly Samsung (or its US subsidiary), Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology\u2014before the end of the year. The government may use leverage from ongoing or future CHIPS Act disbursements, selectively require equity in exchange for new or continued subsidies, and publicize the deal as a policy success. The deal could be for a token or small share, as the fine print only requires 'any amount of stock' to resolve Yes.",
            "final_reasoning": "The administration has demonstrated a strong willingness to convert CHIPS Act subsidies into equity in at least one major case (Intel) and is publicly committed to similar deals in strategic sectors. However, there is clear and repeated messaging from both US officials and the companies themselves that TSMC and Micron are excluded due to their large and ongoing US investments. The administration has not ruled out equity stakes in Samsung, Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology, and Samsung in particular is singled out in news coverage as a major recipient of funds and a possible target. The political pressure to announce further deals before the 2026 midterms is high, and the government has demonstrated a willingness to move quickly, even in the face of corporate resistance (as with Intel and MP Materials). While legal and procedural hurdles exist, the administration has already demonstrated flexibility in interpreting the CHIPS Act to enable equity deals, and the fine print of the question only requires any amount of stock to be acquired, not a major or finalized restructuring. Balancing these factors, I judge that a government equity acquisition in at least one company on the list\u2014most likely Samsung or a US subsidiary\u2014is somewhat more likely than not, but not overwhelmingly so, due to the significant countervailing factors, especially the risk of companies returning subsidies or negotiating alternative terms.",
