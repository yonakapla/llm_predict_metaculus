Multiple official sources (WSJ, Commerce Secretary Lutnick) have explicitly exempted TSMC and Micron due to their massive US investments, meaning these two are almost certainly off the table. Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology remain exposed. The administration\u2019s highly public campaign and explicit midterm timeline create strong incentives to secure a government equity stake in at least one more firm before year-end, most likely Samsung (which continues to receive CHIPS Act subsidies and is not explicitly exempt) or, less likely but possible, Global Foundries or Microchip Technology. While there are legal and diplomatic risks, the administration\u2019s willingness to push through controversial deals, and the lack of categorical denials regarding Samsung and the US-based firms, suggests the probability is significantly higher than historical base rates. I estimate a probability of 68%, reflecting both strong political incentives and strategic focus, but also recognizing the meaningful barriers and explicit exemptions for TSMC and Micron.",

I am attuned to the interplay between national security priorities, industrial policy, and the risk calculus of both governments and multinational firms. This helps me assess the likelihood of state intervention in corporate equity, especially under conditions of great power competition and election-driven policy signaling.",

            "no_scenario": "The administration maintains its exemption policy for firms with large US investments. Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology either agree to additional US investment commitments, or the administration chooses not to push for equity in the face of legal, commercial, or diplomatic risks. The policy shift remains largely symbolic beyond the Intel deal, and no new government stakes are acquired in the named companies before the end of 2025.",
            "yes_scenario": "The administration, motivated by the desire to present more victories before the 2026 midterms and to reinforce its new industrial policy, pressures Samsung or another eligible company (such as Global Foundries or Microchip) into agreeing to a government equity stake in exchange for continued CHIPS funding. Samsung is the most likely target, given its sizable but not TSMC-scale US investments and lack of explicit exemption. The administration may also use the threat of tariffs or withheld subsidies to force a deal.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates for direct US government acquisition of large-scale equity in private firms outside of crisis periods are low, but the Intel deal and the rapid policy shift under the Trump administration raise the odds considerably. The administration is highly motivated to pursue and publicize further deals in strategic sectors, and Samsung and other US-based firms like Global Foundries and Microchip Technology have not received clear exemptions. However, the legal and commercial challenges, as well as the desire to avoid scaring off anchor investors, may limit the scope of action. Given the aggressive timeline, political incentives, and precedent set by Intel, I judge that there is a significant chance (but not a certainty) that at least one of the named companies\u2014most likely Samsung or Global Foundries\u2014will see the US government acquire an equity stake before 2026. The probability is further increased by the administration's selective, case-by-case approach and the explicit intention to announce further deals before the midterms. However, the strong opposition from TSMC and Micron, and their explicit exemptions, mean that the risk is concentrated in the other firms. Weighing all these factors, I estimate the probability at 65%.",
