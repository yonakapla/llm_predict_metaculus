Recent positive news (rallies, partnerships, strong reporting) outweighs negative catalysts before year-end.

The newsflow is balanced: it features competitive concerns (Broadcom, Google, OpenAI, AMD catching up), but also emphasizes partnerships, new product cycles, exceptional fundamentals, and ongoing AI demand. Price targets and sentiment from major analysts still signal room for upside. The stock\u2019s cushion above the resolution threshold is substantial, and late-year profit-taking/correction risks are real but historically rarely erase such a large year-to-date lead in the absence of a shock.

While the pace of Nvidia's growth is decelerating and competitive threats (custom silicon from hyperscalers, AMD/AVGO) are rising, these are mostly longer-term issues. Recent collaborative moves (e.g., with Intel) and guidance suggest Nvidia is adapting, mitigating some risk. Aggregate analyst targets remain modestly bullish. However, with valuations high and the market often pricing in perfection, a correction cannot be excluded\u2014especially if investors rotate out of tech or if a macro shock occurs. Yet, for Nvidia to fall below $134.29 (approx. a 25%+ drop from here), a severe, sustained tech-sector drawdown or company-specific shock would be required. Current data, industry momentum, and valuations make such an outcome possible but not likely\u2014and the status quo strongly favors 'Yes.'
