            "no_scenario": "Kim Jong-un continues to use the threat of a test for diplomatic and domestic leverage, but refrains from an actual detonation. North Korea instead focuses on satellite launches, missile development, and conventional force modernization, avoiding the international backlash that a nuclear test would trigger. Russia and China quietly counsel restraint to avoid further sanctions or U.S. military responses. The regime calculates that it can achieve its strategic aims without crossing the nuclear test threshold, especially with ongoing support from Russia and China.",
            "yes_scenario": "A sudden geopolitical crisis or perceived opportunity (e.g., U.S./ROK military action, leadership challenge, or a breakdown in relations with China/Russia) prompts Kim to authorize a test for maximum shock value and to force a recalibration of international responses. Alternatively, North Korea may seek to demonstrate new warhead miniaturization or tactical nuclear capability in response to U.S./ROK nuclear submarine deployment or perceived encirclement, judging that the diplomatic price is manageable due to Russia/China's protection.",
            "final_reasoning": "Despite North Korea\u2019s technical readiness and ample fissile material, the regime\u2019s strategic culture, current leverage maximization, and prevailing trends suggest a test before the end of 2025 is unlikely. Kim Jong-un\u2019s government has shifted from frequent demonstrations to consolidating its arsenal, leveraging missile exports to Russia and deepening ties with both Moscow and Beijing. Internal incentives for provocation are muted, and the regime has successfully normalized its nuclear status domestically and among its partners. The international environment is tense but not at a crisis point that would drive a high-risk test. The base rate is a useful anchor, but must be adjusted downward given the absence of acute triggers and the regime\u2019s preference for brinkmanship over irreversible escalation. The most compelling scenario for a test (acute crisis or leadership instability) is not present. Therefore, the probability of a North Korean nuclear test before January 1, 2026, should be assessed as low, albeit not zero given the regime's unpredictability and technical capability.",
