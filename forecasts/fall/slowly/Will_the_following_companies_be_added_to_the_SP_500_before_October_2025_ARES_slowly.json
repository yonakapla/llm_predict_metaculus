No indication exists in the news or official committee statements of an imminent ARES addition. ARES is well-qualified and, by all technical and sectoral measures, likely to be added at some point in the next several quarterly cycles, but the probability that this will happen specifically before October 2025 is sharply diminished by (1) the committee\u2019s tendency to batch additions and limit the number per quarter, (2) the recent set of high-profile inclusions already filling available slots, and (3) the absence of triggers\u2014such as a major constituent exit or urgent sector underweighting\u2014that would force an extra addition in the very short remaining time window. While ARES is a strong long-term candidate, the status quo outcome (not added before October) should be heavily favored based on both base rates (very few off-cycle inclusions) and specific observable actions in this rebalance cycle. I assign a moderate but non-zero probability in case of extreme outlier events (e.g., eleventh-hour deletions or emergencies), but I weigh these less than 10%.

Recent index changes support ongoing constituent turnover with inflows for qualifying firms. Sell-side and buy-side consensus points toward ARES being 'up next' for a spot, with each rebalance in this period viewed as a likely window. The main risk is one of sequencing and index committee prioritization, but with approximately half a year and multiple quarterly windows left, and barring a late-stage negative event, ARES\u2019s addition before October 2025 is more likely than not.",

The recent addition of Robinhood and AppLovin, and the exclusion of MicroStrategy on non-technical grounds, reaffirm the committee\u2019s use of discretion but also show a willingness to add large, stable, and profitable firms in the absence of red flags. That said, the main headwind is the limited number of slots and competition from equally qualified candidates. Historically, approximately 10\u201315 companies join the index annually, suggesting a base rate of ~2\u20133% per eligible large-cap candidate per rebalance window, but this rises for strong candidates like ARES. Factoring in the missed September window, but with additional chances via removals or the end-of-year rebalance, I estimate the probability at 35%.

The news makes clear that technical eligibility does not guarantee admission, as seen in the MSTR case, and the committee\u2019s discretionary power and goals for sector balance are critical. However, from a Resource-Based View, ARES stands out as a firm with durable advantages, sectoral leadership, and a scalable, robust business model. It avoids idiosyncratic risks (e.g., crypto or extreme business volatility) that have led to the committee's exclusion of otherwise-eligible companies. Given this, and the historical rate of new additions per year, it's plausible but not probable that ARES will be added prior to October 2025. I weight the base rate for inclusion of large, highly-eligible non-tech firms post-September rebalance at approximately 15-20%, adjust upward slightly for the company's excellent strategic positioning, and downward again due to recency of the latest rebalance (with HOOD/APP as fresh additions potentially satiating the committee\u2019s appetite for now).
