European parallels suggest the ceiling is still rising but not rapidly accelerating. Methodological considerations argue that reported share may oscillate above and below the 27% mark because of sample noise and substantial undecided/abstention shares. The broader dynamic is supportive of a sustained or slight further increase, and with one poll already at 27%, a single additional uptick\u2014even just from statistical noise\u2014could produce a >27% result before the end of 2025. The question asks only for a single, not sustained, breach in the next poll before quota. I therefore assign notable weight to the upside scenario\u2014given both the upward trend and the fact that base rates for polling 'spikes' above thresholds increase when the status quo is right at the threshold. That said, most conventional and status quo signals imply Vox is peaking among youth; the balance of factors (especially abstention and gender split) dampen the probability of a high breakaway, so an extreme (>50%) forecast is not justified. On balance, the probability is somewhat above even odds because of current momentum, the secular trend, and base-rate likelihood of a marginal breach, but the ceiling effect, sample volatility, and methodological caveats prevent bolder extremity.",

The probability that the next/final poll is exactly above 27% is therefore meaningfully lower than just extrapolating trend. Sampling and nonresponse artifacts, plus abstention spikes (the first 'party' for youth is abstention), imply it is more likely the number hovers between 25-27% than cleanly surpasses 27%. The status quo and trend favor a number right at the edge; the risk of a downswing or reversion (due to sampling error, turnout modeling, gender mix, or news shocks) is real.

            "no_scenario": "In periodic 40dB polls through December 2025, Vox's support among 18\u201324-year-olds rises and falls in the 21\u201326% range, peaking just at or below 27%. The absence of a galvanizing national crisis, no viral new resonance for Vox, and persistent high abstention among youth hold the percentage below the threshold. Some far-right-leaning youth drift to Alvise or regional nationalist options, fragmenting the protest vote. The final 2025 40dB youth breakdown shows 27% or less for Vox, and the question resolves No.",
            "yes_scenario": "Vox leverages ongoing viral success on social networks, possibly aided by a polarizing event (immigration crisis, major security or housing incident) or a further decline in PP's youth credibility, pushing some undecided or protest-minded young men to Vox. Abstention among youth falls slightly as the sense of a generational rebellion or backlash kicks in. In the last 40dB survey, Vox registers 28\u201330% direct voting intention among 18\u201324-year-olds, surpassing the 27% mark for the first time.",
            "final_reasoning": "The evidence paints a picture of rising but not runaway Vox support among young people. The party leads among 18\u201324-year-olds, with recent peaks at or near 27%, reflecting a European-wide youth rightward drift and a particularly acute reaction to Spain's economic and social malaise felt by the young. However, several capping mechanisms remain: baseline abstention among youth is historically high, and while Vox is making efficient use of social media, the growth curve is starting to flatten near its current ceiling, with no polling data definitively above the 27% mark. Gender splits further limit upside, as most right-leaning young men already support Vox, and young women are tilting left. Competition (e.g., Alvise, regional ultras) and volatility\u2014especially the transition from intention to actual turnout\u2014also suggest limited further immediate gains. While an unexpected polarizing event could tip the scales, the preponderance of evidence and base rates\u2014especially the difficulty of surpassing specific, round polling thresholds in the absence of a new shock\u2014keep the most likely outcome just below the resolution criterion. Given all of this, the probability that Vox will surpass 27% youth voting intention in a 40dB poll by the end of 2025 is higher than even chance but short of likely.",
