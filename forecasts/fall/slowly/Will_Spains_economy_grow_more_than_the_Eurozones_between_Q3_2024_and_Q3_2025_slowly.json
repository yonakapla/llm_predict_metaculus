At the same time, the Eurozone is set for some catch-up, driven by delayed stimulus in Germany and Italy and the fading drag from trade/tariffs. Still, Spain\u2019s ongoing labor market expansion (even with high unemployment, employment growth outpaces the Eurozone), regional strengths (notably Madrid), and solid consumption provide significant inertia for outperformance. The base rate since 2021 is heavy Spanish outperformance; such runs usually end with gap narrowing, but not always reversal. Given current growth differential and no evident, large negative Spanish shock (and no major German/Italian surge yet emerging), the most probable outcome is for Spain to again outgrow the aggregate Eurozone, though with a narrower margin.

Eurozone aggregate remains dragged by Germany/Italy's weak recoveries, keeping EA growth in the 1.2-1.5% YoY range. Even as Spanish growth cools, it stays comfortably ahead of the EA average.

There is little evidence of an imminent negative BoP adjustment (large current account reversal or drying up of FDI) that would abruptly stall Spain's growth in the next 12 months. Instead, gradual mean reversion is expected: Spanish growth decelerates, but so does the convergence, given that Germany/Italy are likely to see some rebound, yet not enough to overtake Spain given current projections (Spain: ~2.7%, EA: ~1.2\u20131.4% for 2025). Most institutional forecasts and current data support a continued (albeit narrowing) Spanish lead in YoY growth to Q3 2025. Applying the balance-of-payments perspective, there is no overwhelming external or internal adjustment on the horizon, but the risk of the gap closing as the Eurozone's core rebounds cannot be dismissed. Thus, the hedged but optimistic forecast is around 80%.",

Latest available data confirms this trend through mid-2025. All major institutional and analyst forecasts expect Spain to slow but still grow faster than the bloc. While there is a plausible narrowing of the gap due to stabilization and slight recovery in core Eurozone economies and fading one-offs in Spain (e.g. EU funds absorption), the delta is large enough (~1.3 percentage points in Q2 2025 yoy) that significant convergence would need an upside surprise in the Eurozone and/or a downside surprise in Spain. Even under relatively conservative scenarios\u2014Spain slowing to ~2.7% and Eurozone bouncing towards upper consensus (~1.2%)\u2014Spain is still likely ahead. The strongest arguments for 'No' rely on much faster Eurozone catch-up or much sharper deceleration in Spain than anyone currently projects. However, my convergence/divergence expertise suggests such rapid convergence is historically rare within a single year, especially absent a strong policy shock or reversal of structural trends. Structural social and productivity issues in Spain remain, but these have not yet derailed headline growth. I therefore forecast with high confidence that Spain will outgrow the Eurozone in the specified period.",
