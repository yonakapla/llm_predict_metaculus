The time left is short for even a symbolic treaty to be drafted, signed, and ratified. Domestic politics in both countries still create major headwinds for even symbolic concessions. However, the October 2024 agreement, ongoing WMCC talks, and high-level rhetoric do increase the chance for a face-saving, 'process-oriented' treaty.

However, the recent diplomatic thaw, multiple references to 'development partnership', and concrete disengagement agreements show an uptick in risk management and desire for normalization. The extremely low bar for question resolution (any ratified treaty referencing steps toward the dispute counts) means a procedural, face-saving agreement is conceivable, especially as a diplomatic gesture heading into 2026. Still, the historical record and fundamental interests weigh heavily against even procedural treaties on such sensitive matters. Overall, while the odds are slightly higher than in previous years, a breakthrough remains unlikely in the short window remaining.",

However, the historical base rate for ratified treaties on the border is low, and the time frame is very short, with domestic political and bureaucratic obstacles significant, especially given ongoing tensions (e.g., Ladakh unrest).

The base rate for new, ratified Sino-Indian border treaties is essentially zero over the past 30 years, despite many agreements in principle. While 2024-2025 has seen some normalization (e.g., disengagement agreements, resumed patrols, positive rhetoric), there have also been setbacks (fresh violence, ongoing troop deployments, arrests in Ladakh, continued distrust). The criteria's low bar does increase the possibility, but recent reporting suggests both sides are content with incremental normalization and are risk-averse about formalizing anything that could provoke domestic or military backlash. With only 2.5 months left and no public reporting of a treaty in process, the probability remains low. However, the low bar and ongoing dialogue push it above zero. I estimate a 10% probability that a ratified bilateral treaty addressing the border dispute (even minimally) will be concluded by year-end 2025.",
