The treaty is ratified through the proper legislative/executive channels on both sides before December 31, 2025.",
            "final_reasoning": "Historically, the status quo is sticky: substantive border treaties have been avoided since the 1990s, and even after major crises, the parties have settled for incremental, non-ratified agreements or confidence-building measures. However, two factors nudge probability upwards: (1) the extremely low bar set by the question's fine print\u2014ANY ratified treaty referencing the border dispute, no matter how vague, resolves YES; (2) recent diplomatic thaw, resumed high-level dialogues, and the restoration of pre-2020 protocols suggest both sides are seeking to publicly signal a return to normalcy, potentially via a symbolic treaty. On the other hand, persistent mistrust, recent local incidents (Ladakh unrest, Sikkim clashes), and the deep domestic/political aversion to appearing to cede claims make even a symbolic treaty nontrivial. Given the very short time window left (three months), and the lack (as of now) of any announcement or text of such a treaty, the base rate for a new, even symbolic, ratified treaty in any given year is quite low. However, the combination of incentives to signal progress and the minimal requirements for a YES outcome mean the odds are not negligible. Weighing these, the probability should be higher than the historical base rate for substantive treaties, but still below even odds due to the short timeline and persistent bilateral caution.",
