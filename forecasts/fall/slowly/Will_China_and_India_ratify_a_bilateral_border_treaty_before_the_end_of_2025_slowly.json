The bar for resolution is low: even a symbolic treaty mentioning border talks would count. However, the base rate for such treaties between these two is low, and the pattern has been to rely on informal or executive-only agreements, not treaties requiring ratification. Domestic politics and the risk of renewed incidents remain strong disincentives, and recent unrest in Ladakh underscores this. While both sides have incentives for symbolic progress, the inertia of past negotiation behavior and the risk aversion of both governments make rapid, formal ratification unlikely absent a major new breakthrough.

Even with the low threshold for what counts as a qualifying treaty, the domestic political and military risks of formal ratification are significant, and most progress so far has been at the level of informal agreements or working mechanisms. Track Two efforts may help prepare the ground, but they are unlikely to deliver a ratified treaty within the next 2.5 months.

Realistically, both states have incentives to signal progress without making meaningful concessions. If a symbolic, 'procedural' treaty can be signed and ratified\u2014without changing the ground reality\u2014this would satisfy the criteria. Yet, the recurring incidents in Ladakh and continuing mutual suspicion are significant headwinds. On balance, while the permissiveness of the resolution criteria increases the probability well above the historic base rate, the short timeline and persistent mistrust keep the chance moderate.

            "no_scenario": "Despite ongoing diplomatic engagement, India and China continue with incremental disengagements and enhanced military and diplomatic dialogue but do not proceed to formal ratification of any new bilateral treaty by the end of 2025. Announcements focus on maintaining peace, restoring previous protocols, and working towards a future settlement, but no document is signed and ratified by both governments that explicitly addresses the border issue (even at a minimal level) before the deadline.",
            "yes_scenario": "A symbolic, minimalist treaty is rapidly drafted and pushed through domestic ratification processes in both countries before January 1, 2026\u2014perhaps as a gesture to cement the October 2024 agreement or as part of a diplomatic 'reset' before elections in India or major international summits. The treaty includes only broad language committing to further talks or affirming the status quo but is sufficient under the question's permissive criteria.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates for formal, ratified Sino-Indian border treaties are extremely low, with only a handful in 30+ years, all following major crises and extensive negotiation. Although engagement has recently improved and there is public signaling of partnership, there is no concrete evidence of a treaty in the pipeline. Domestic constraints (nationalism, risk aversion) in both countries discourage any move that could be spun as territorial concession. The resolution criteria are permissive, but even a minimal treaty would require bureaucratic and political effort, which is unlikely to be mobilized in such a short time (2.5 months) unless there is a sudden, high-level political push. Recent incidents along the border, as well as ongoing troop presence and unrest, underscore the fragility of trust and the lack of readiness for even symbolic ratification. Given all factors, the probability must be set low, though not at zero because of the permissiveness of the criteria and the possibility of a surprise symbolic gesture.",
