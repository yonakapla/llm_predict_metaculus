Alternatively (almost as unlikely), Carney resigns/disappears, the Liberals are unable to command House confidence, and the Governor General\u2014contrary to established precedent\u2014calls on Poilievre to form a government with ad hoc support (instead of holding a new election).

The Canadian system is highly stable immediately post-election; the probability of an opposition leader becoming PM without electoral victory is microscopic. Furthermore, Poilievre faces significant doubts inside his party (likely confronting a confidence review in Jan. 2026) and has not demonstrated a path to toppling the government or winning a snap election in the <4 months before question close. Any path to a 'yes' requires a dramatically implausible series of parliamentary and electoral upsets within an uncommonly tight window.

No election is triggered, or\u2014if there is a snap election (highly unlikely)\u2014the Liberals or another party, not Poilievre\u2019s Conservatives, manage to retain power.",

Instead of dissolving Parliament for a new election, an unlikely coalition emerges where the Conservatives, possibly with cross-bench support, can demonstrate to the Governor General that Poilievre commands the confidence of the House. He is then appointed Prime Minister before Jan 1, 2026. Alternatively, an extremely rapid snap election is called within months, Conservatives win, and Poilievre is sworn in just in time.",

The status quo is reinforced by both formal parliamentary math and the customary caution of Canadian federal transitions. The Liberals lead a minority government but one that is stable for the short term, facing only the ordinary challenges of a post-election Parliament. Even with internal Conservative debates around Poilievre\u2019s leadership, there is no sign of imminent government collapse or a rapid electoral reversal. The time remaining is too short to fit both a no-confidence sequence and a subsequent electoral/coalition path to Poilievre\u2019s premiership. Base rates for opposition leaders becoming Prime Minister between elections in Canada are close to zero since WWII. Therefore, the probability is extremely low, but not absolute zero due to the theoretical possibility of abrupt political upheaval.",
