Congress remains gridlocked or unable to muster the votes required for such a far-reaching measure, and trade disruptions continue on an ad hoc basis.",

Trump and Republican leaders push a major tariff bill through a narrowly held Republican House and Senate, overcoming internal dissent in the GOP, and Democrats are unable or unwilling to filibuster or block it. The bill passes both chambers and reconciled language is approved before the end of 2025.",

The recent news shows continued reliance on executive orders, intense legal/judicial disputes, and escalating trade tensions, but no evidence of Congressional momentum on a comprehensive tariff bill. The Supreme Court's pending review adds some uncertainty, but even a dramatic ruling against the administration would face the historical inertia, intra-party divides, and massive economic opposition to such a bill. The base rate for similar Congressional action is extremely low since 1930. With only two months left in 2025 and no bill reported as advancing, the probability is very low.",
