Most units shipped before 2026 are either not fully autonomous or are developer kits, pilots, or special-order prototypes, not meeting the strict resolution criteria.",

Most robots showcased in late 2025 (e.g., Unitree H2, YuShu H2, Lingxin G2) are at the stage of technical validation or initial commercial rollout, with hundreds of units ordered or delivered, but not yet proven at 1,000+ scale. Key obstacles\u2014cost, standardization, motion reliability, and real-world autonomy\u2014are repeatedly cited as unresolved. While state mobilization and commercial incentives create strong tailwinds, and some companies may attempt to claim \"mass production,\" the strict resolution criteria require both credible public reporting and clear autonomy/capability. Given the historic base rate for such transitions (several years from demos/pilots to mass production), the technical and supply chain challenges, and the lack of hard evidence as of October 2025, I assess a moderate probability: higher than in previous years, but still less than even odds.",

The probability is thus significantly above 50%\u2014China will likely achieve this milestone or at least claim it, but there is still meaningful risk of shortfall, overstatement, or definitional slippage. As an expert in Chinese industrial policy, I give extra weight to the likelihood of a late-year push to meet targets, but remain cautious about technical and definitional rigor.
