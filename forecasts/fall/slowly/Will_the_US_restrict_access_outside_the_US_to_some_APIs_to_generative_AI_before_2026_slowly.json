There is no evidence of active Congressional or regulatory movement toward requiring US-only API access for generative AI, except in the context of existing sanctions/embargoed countries. The base rate for such extraterritorial, across-the-board restrictions is extremely low; even in sensitive sectors, the US typically targets specific countries/entities, not the entire world outside the US. Although the OpenAI report on Chinese state actors and the trend toward age verification could provide a trigger, the status quo is likely to persist absent a major, catalyst event.

Most recent legislative movement (e.g., California's SB 243, FTC investigations) is about user age and safety, not location. Internationally, the momentum is toward age/content-based restrictions rather than geo-blocking, and US industry has strong incentives to avoid restrictions that would cede ground to non-US competitors. Geo-restrictions are also widely understood to be trivially circumvented by VPNs, reducing their appeal and likely efficacy. Given the short window to resolution (by Dec 31, 2025), and absent a major, unpredictable triggering event, it is highly unlikely that a US law requiring API geo-restriction will be enacted and implemented in time.
