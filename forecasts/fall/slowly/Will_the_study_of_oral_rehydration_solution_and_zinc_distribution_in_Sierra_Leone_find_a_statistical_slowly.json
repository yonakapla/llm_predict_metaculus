            "no_scenario": "Field teams carry out two rounds of distribution and education, but confusion or information overload limits the behavioral uptake of ORS/zinc to only a marginal degree. Little improvement over 43% usage is observed; perhaps both control and treatment groups end up around 45%, due to reporting noise or spillover, and the study is underpowered or finds p>0.05. Alternatively, survey attrition, local resistance, logistical breakdowns, or substitution behavior (with chlorine) blunt the measurable effect. Alternatively, outbreak/political instability or supply chain failures prevent completion of the study.",
            "yes_scenario": "Health workers effectively reach target households, messaging is clear, and households have recent salience of diarrhea risk. Even with the complex bundle, ORS/zinc is recognized as a distinct and immediately beneficial treatment in a context where diarrheal diseases are ever-present. Uptake in the treatment group rises by >8 percentage points (e.g., to 52%+) compared to control, the RCT achieves sufficient sample size and survey quality, and a clear statistically significant effect with p<0.05 is reported.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates from previous door-to-door or CHW-driven campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa commonly show increases in commodity usage when products are freely given and coupled with education, as in this study. However, a bundle of disparate health interventions carries real risks of message dilution. GiveWell, with direct access to study plans and local risk factors, assigns a 70% probability. Given my postcolonial health systems perspective, I would weight the long history of both positive impact from outreach (when done well in remote West Africa) and the practical-but-nontrivial risk of weaker-than-expected uptake due to message overload, local suspicion, or cultural mismatch\u2014yet there are few signals of major new risk, and this type of RCT is generally well executed by Wageningen/its partners. Implementation risk and complexity should tilt slightly below GiveWell\u2019s estimate, but only modestly. I also put extra weight on the status quo: most such interventions work, unless actively undercut by practical/structural barriers that seem modest in this case. The bundle nature is appropriately flagged, but not overwhelmingly so. Given all this, my best estimate is that the probability of the study finding a statistically significant increase in ORS/zinc usage is about 65%.",
