Iran's political rhetoric continues to deny weapon intent, and the regime remains sensitive to deterrence signals from the US and Israel. The reimposition of sanctions and collapse of the JCPOA have increased long-term risk, but the timeframe to 2026 is extremely short for weaponization, especially under scrutiny and threat of further military action. Furthermore, the resolution criteria require clear, credible attribution; mere ambiguity or suspicion does not suffice. The historical base rate for threshold states overtly crossing to weapon status is extremely low, particularly on such a compressed timeline. No available reporting from authoritative sources suggests imminent weaponization or testing. In summary, despite the highly volatile environment and Iran's technical progress, it is extremely unlikely Iran will be credibly reported as possessing a nuclear weapon before 2026.",

The most plausible scenario is continued ambiguity and enrichment, not open weaponization. The status quo is favored. My probability is at the low end, but not absolute zero, due to persistent tensions, Iranian resolve, and the possibility (however unlikely) of a crisis-triggered dash.
