Weaponization itself (design, testing, integration) remains a major bottleneck and is subject to delays, especially under pressure and surveillance. The base rate of new nuclear powers is extremely low, and the risk of a public, testable Iranian nuclear weapon before the end of 2025 is further reduced by intense international monitoring, the threat of overwhelming retaliation, and the high threshold for question resolution (credible declaration, test, or reporting by top authorities). While the loss of IAEA monitoring and breakdown of negotiations raise longer-term risks, the compressed timeline (less than 3 months) makes a sudden, overt breakout exceedingly unlikely barring a dramatic and currently unforeseeable crisis. The likeliest scenario is continued ambiguity and brinkmanship, not a clear, public nuclear breakout.",
