OpenAI's unprecedented Nvidia investment and pattern of high-profile year-end releases suggest a strong chance of a major leap in the coming months. The leaderboard is highly sensitive to hype and user engagement, and OpenAI\u2019s brand and user base give it an advantage in mobilizing votes. However, Google\u2019s Gemini remains strong and could release further improvements or even a new version, and regulatory or safety concerns could blunt OpenAI\u2019s momentum. Given these factors, the outcome is highly competitive but tilts slightly toward OpenAI, especially considering the status quo bias is not overwhelming (since the leaderboard has seen several leadership changes in recent quarters). The probability should be bold but not extreme, reflecting both the social construction of 'best' and the intense technical arms race.",

OpenAI leverages its vast user base and developer community to drive favorable votes. Even if Google releases new Gemini versions, OpenAI\u2019s improvements in reasoning, creativity, or multimodal capability are sufficiently recognized by Arena users to take (or tie for) the top spot.",

The status quo is Google on top, but OpenAI is heavily resourced, has a dominant user base, and has a history of strategic model launches to regain the lead. Actor-Network Theory emphasizes not just technical progress but also the power of organizational networks, user mobilization, and platform dynamics. The $100B Nvidia investment signals an imminent push. However, Google's integration with ubiquitous platforms and its recent technical lead are significant obstacles. Regulatory or PR headwinds for OpenAI are real but likely manageable. Given the high volatility, the time left for a disruptive OpenAI release, and the company's proven ability to mobilize its networks, I assign a slightly above-even probability that OpenAI will top the leaderboard (alone or in a tie) at the December 31, 2025, snapshot. I remain cautious of overconfidence due to the platform's inherent subjectivity and the possibility of tie scenarios.",
