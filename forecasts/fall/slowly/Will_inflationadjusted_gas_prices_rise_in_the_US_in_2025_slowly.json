US macroeconomic weakness is holding back demand. Inflation is running above target, but unless nominal gasoline prices rise disproportionately, real prices are likely to be flat or down. The only major risk to this view is a geopolitical or supply shock, but there is no firm evidence of one materializing imminently.

US economic growth is slowing, and consumer demand is under pressure, further reducing upward pressure on gas prices. Inflation is running above target but not accelerating, and much of the CPI increase is not energy-driven. While a weaker dollar and political unpredictability could provide upward risks, they are not sufficient to outweigh the strong downward pressure from global supply/demand fundamentals. The most likely scenario is that real gas prices in December 2025 will be flat or lower compared to December 2024.

Macro indicators show sluggish growth and rising uncertainty, which typically limit demand-side price spikes.
