The news flow repeatedly points to oil prices at or below $60 WTI and further declines projected into 2026. Gasoline prices (nominal) are not rising as fast as general inflation, and the latest data (August/September) show prices below winter peaks. Upside wildcards (geopolitical shock, supply disruption, or a demand spike) are possible but not the base case. Therefore, while a modest increase in inflation-adjusted gas prices is not impossible, the most likely outcome is flat or lower real prices for December 2025 vs. December 2024. Given the base rate, the current oversupply, and the lack of major positive demand shocks, I assign a probability below 50%. To reflect some residual risk from wildcards and the potential underestimation of inflation, I set the probability slightly above the historical base rate for a decrease, but well below 50%.",
