Inflation is running higher than the Fed target, but not at a level likely to offset the nominal decline in gasoline prices.

While the weaker dollar and persistent US inflation are modest counterweights, they are unlikely to override the effects of cheap crude and soft US demand. There is some tail risk of a late-year supply shock, but absent new evidence, the most likely scenario is that inflation-adjusted US gas prices will be flat or down year-on-year in December 2025.

The US macro outlook is weak, with consumer demand and industrial activity both subdued. While tariffs and a weakening dollar could provide some upward price pressure, gasoline is not directly targeted by tariffs and the effect is secondary. CPI inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target but not alarmingly high, and if CPI rises modestly, it further lowers the inflation-adjusted gas price unless there is a nominal gas price surge.

US shale is faltering, but the effect in 2025 is likely outweighed by the sheer size of the OPEC+ supply ramp. Crude prices are forecast by multiple banks and agencies (Goldman Sachs, EIA) to fall or remain low in 2025, with WTI in the $50\u201360 range\u2014a level that typically leads to lower US gas prices. Tariffs and a weaker dollar do provide some upward pressure, but not enough to offset the supply-driven decline in crude. US demand is soft, and political incentives are aligned toward keeping gas prices from rising in an election year.
