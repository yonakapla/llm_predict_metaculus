The base rate of two dissolutions in such rapid succession is extremely low in the Fifth Republic. However, the current level of political instability is unprecedented: five prime ministers in two years, repeated budget impasses, and a looming fiscal crisis. The government is surviving week-to-week, and the opposition is highly mobilized. If the new government falls again or is unable to pass a legally required budget by year's end, Macron might feel compelled to dissolve as a last resort to avert a constitutional, political, or financial meltdown. We are in a regime of abnormal, high-variance outcomes, but the structural constraints and Macron's incentives still lean toward muddling through rather than risking another dissolution. On balance, I judge a snap election call before January 1, 2026 as possible but more likely than not to be avoided, with the probability somewhat elevated by the extreme instability and budget crises.",

Public opinion is firmly against another dissolution, and political elites view a repeat as a sign of regime breakdown. However, the current situation is unusually unstable: five prime ministers in under two years, persistent budget crises, mass protests, and the inability to form a working government. France's debt and deficit issues, international market pressure, and the risk of a constitutional or financial crisis keep open the possibility that Macron may be compelled to act if all other options fail. On balance, scenario analysis suggests the status quo (no new election) is still the most likely outcome, given institutional inertia, public opposition, and Macron's own risk aversion. But the probability is materially elevated compared to normal French politics, given the scale of the crisis.

On balance, while the structural incentives for a new dissolution are rising, the strong public/elite aversion to another snap election, the base rate, and Macron\u2019s own political caution make it more likely that he will muddle through until 2026, unless a total impasse leaves him with no alternative.

            "perspective_relevance": "My expertise in French Studies, especially constitutional analysis of the Fifth Republic, is highly relevant because the question hinges on both the political calculus of President Macron and the constitutional mechanics governing the dissolution of the National Assembly. The 1958 Constitution gives the president significant discretion, but only under specific political-institutional circumstances, and the current environment of instability, past precedent, and constitutional limitations all bear directly on the forecast.",
            "status_quo": "No further snap election is called before 2026. Instead, Macron continues to cycle through prime ministers and minority cabinets, relying on compromise, ad hoc alliances, and constitutional mechanisms to survive until the next scheduled legislative elections.",

Macron used this power in June 2024, so he cannot call another dissolution until July 2025. Historically, dissolutions are rare (six times since 1958), and a second dissolution in such close succession is unprecedented and would be seen as a constitutional last resort."

The current Assembly is highly fragmented, with five prime ministers in two years and persistent inability to pass budgets or maintain majority support. Votes of no confidence have toppled multiple prime ministers. This level of instability puts real pressure on Macron to seek a solution, with dissolution as a constitutional safety valve."

Recent polling and public discourse indicate strong opposition to another snap election. 62% reject a new dissolution before 2027, and Macron's last dissolution is now widely seen as a political blunder that deepened the crisis. Calling another dissolution could further erode legitimacy and risk backlash."

Macron has little to gain from another dissolution: polls suggest no bloc would win a governing majority, and the National Rally could gain further. Macron\u2019s approval is at record lows, and he likely wants to avoid triggering a scenario that could hasten the rise of the opposition or further diminish his power."

Widespread strikes, protests, and budget impasses increase the risk of a total breakdown, which could push Macron to call elections if no government can hold for even a short period."

            "no_scenario": "Despite ongoing instability and repeated government collapses, Macron continues to appoint new prime ministers, shifting policy and negotiating ad hoc support to pass budgets. The Assembly remains unruly, but no single crisis is acute enough to force immediate dissolution. Macron, chastened by public backlash and the risks of another snap election, chooses to muddle through until 2026, even at the cost of further weakening his presidency.",
            "yes_scenario": "Parliamentary deadlock worsens: the next budget fails completely, no prime minister can secure or retain a majority, and a series of no-confidence motions make government formation impossible. Social unrest escalates into a crisis of order, or a financial shock (such as ratings downgrades or eurozone intervention) makes the status quo untenable. Faced with total paralysis and explicit calls from all blocs for new elections, Macron invokes Article 12 and dissolves the Assembly\u2014accepting the political risks as necessary to restore some form of government.",
            "final_reasoning": "The constitutional mechanism is available after July 2025, and the level of political instability is extraordinary, with a historically unprecedented turnover of prime ministers, repeated failed budgets, and persistent social unrest. However, the base rate for repeated dissolutions is extremely low, and both historical precedent and public opinion are heavily against another snap election. Macron himself is politically weakened, and the likely outcome of a new election would not break the deadlock but could empower his opponents further. French presidents under the Fifth Republic have almost always avoided repeated dissolutions, preferring to manage through technocratic cabinets or minority governments. While the probability is higher than in a normal year due to the extreme instability, the strong institutional and political incentives against another dissolution in such a short window mean the status quo\u2014no further snap election\u2014remains the most likely outcome. Therefore, I assign a probability of 25%.",
