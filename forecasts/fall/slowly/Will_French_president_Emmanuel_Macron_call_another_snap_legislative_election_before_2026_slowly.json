The deadlocked parliament and ongoing instability do increase risk, but the historical pattern in France has been to muddle through with weak, short-lived governments rather than resort to repeated dissolutions. Only an extraordinary escalation\u2014such as complete legislative paralysis, economic meltdown, or a crisis of regime legitimacy\u2014would likely force Macron\u2019s hand. Given the short time frame left (until Jan 1, 2026), the most probable path is continued muddling through with fragile caretaker or technocratic governments. Therefore, while the probability is higher than in normal times (due to high instability), it remains well below 50%. I estimate a 22% probability Macron will call another snap legislative election before 2026.",

I understand the unique balance of power between the President and Parliament, the political calculus behind dissolutions, and the constraints imposed by constitutional law and political culture.",
            "status_quo": "The status quo is that President Macron has not called another snap legislative election since July 2024. The current National Assembly is fractured, the government is unstable, but Macron has thus far preferred to cycle through prime ministers rather than dissolve the Assembly again.",

The recent July 2024 dissolution makes another dissolution within a short period highly irregular and politically risky."

A majority of French citizens view another dissolution before 2027 as undesirable, which would make Macron wary of further eroding his political capital."

            ],
            "no_scenario": "Despite ongoing instability, Macron continues to rotate prime ministers or attempts to form caretaker or minority governments, relying on ad hoc coalitions or Article 49.3 to pass budgets. The opposition fails to unite or force his hand, and Macron, wary of public backlash and further empowering the far-right or left, avoids calling another snap election before 2026.",
            "yes_scenario": "Parliamentary paralysis reaches a breaking point: multiple governments fall in rapid succession, the 2026 budget is blocked, and mass protests or market turmoil undermine political and economic stability. Macron concludes that the only way to restore order is to dissolve the Assembly again, risking a new election despite the political risks, calculating that he might secure a more governable majority or at least shift some blame.",
            "final_reasoning": "While the situation is extremely unstable and the temptation to break the deadlock with a new election is real, the constitutional and political base rates are strongly against a second dissolution so soon after July 2024. The Fifth Republic's tradition, the negative public opinion, and the clear risks to Macron\u2019s legacy and his camp's political fortunes all argue for restraint. Historically, even severe deadlock rarely leads to back-to-back dissolutions; instead, presidents prefer to limp through with caretaker governments or minority cabinets. The news confirms ongoing instability, but does not show an imminent, unavoidable trigger for a new election, and Macron\u2019s own political calculus seems to favor endurance over risk. Given these factors, and allowing for a modest risk of total paralysis forcing his hand, I assess the probability as below.",
