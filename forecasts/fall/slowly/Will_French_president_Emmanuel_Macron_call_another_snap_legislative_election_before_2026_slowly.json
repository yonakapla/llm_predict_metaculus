Public opinion is strongly against a new dissolution, and Macron\u2019s personal and systemic incentives align in favor of enduring instability rather than risking a further loss of legitimacy or a stronger showing by the opposition in new elections. Only a complete breakdown (e.g., an ungovernable parliament, EU/IMF intervention, or mass unrest) could push Macron to call another snap election, but even then, the short time window and the likelihood that any new election would worsen the deadlock make this scenario unlikely.

While a further government crisis or external shock (e.g., budget standoff, EU/IMF pressure) could force his hand, these would have to occur and escalate rapidly post-July. The most likely scenario is muddling through with unstable or technocratic governments rather than risking a new election.

Macron, with no viable options and mounting external and internal crises, calls for another dissolution in late 2025 to break the deadlock, despite public opposition and personal political risk.",
            "final_reasoning": "The current French political situation is extremely unstable: five PMs in two years, serial government collapses, and a hung parliament. However, the Fifth Republic\u2019s structure, the constitutional one-year rule (now expired), and historical precedent all create a strong bias against repeated dissolutions. Moreover, public opinion is overwhelmingly hostile to another snap election, and Macron has little to gain\u2014he is unlikely to secure a more favorable majority, and another dissolution could be seen as reckless or desperate, risking further loss of legitimacy. The base rate for two dissolutions in a short window is near zero in modern French history. While the chance is non-negligible\u2014particularly if government formation becomes literally impossible and France faces acute fiscal or social crisis\u2014the far more likely outcome is continued muddling through with weak, short-lived governments or technocratic caretakers. Therefore, I judge the probability of Macron calling another snap legislative election before 2026 at 15%.",

Each time a government falls, Macron resists opposition calls for dissolution, fearing electoral backlash and remembering the public\u2019s disapproval of the July 2024 snap election. The Assembly remains fragmented, but at least a caretaker government or a technocratic/consensus arrangement endures until the regular 2027 election. Macron is further weakened, but the status quo of instability and gridlock persists.",
            "yes_scenario": "The current government (Lecornu or successor) falls to a no-confidence vote, and after repeated failed attempts to form a new majority, the Assembly is paralyzed. Macron, under intense public, market, and opposition pressure, and unable to form even a minimally functional government, concludes that only dissolution offers a way out. He calls a snap election before the end of 2025, hoping to break the deadlock\u2014even at the risk of further boosting the opposition.",
            "final_reasoning": "The recent news highlights unprecedented instability: five PMs in under two years, repeated government collapses, and a highly fragmented Assembly. The constitutional bar on dissolutions has just been lifted, so a snap election is now technically possible. However, the historical base rate for two dissolutions in a single presidential term is essentially zero, and public opinion is strongly against another snap election so soon. Macron\u2019s political capital is at a nadir, and his incentives are to avoid another dissolution unless absolutely necessary. The French constitutional tradition and the possibility of cohabitation provide alternative ways to manage deadlock, making a second dissolution a last resort. While the instability is severe and pressure is mounting, there is still room for muddling through, caretaker governments, or even a left- or right-wing cohabitation. Only if all other options fail, and the Assembly is utterly paralyzed with no government able to survive even a few months, would Macron dare to dissolve again. Given the base rate, constitutional logic, and political calculus, the probability is higher than in normal times but still clearly below even odds. I assess the probability of Macron calling another snap election before January 1, 2026 at 25%.",
