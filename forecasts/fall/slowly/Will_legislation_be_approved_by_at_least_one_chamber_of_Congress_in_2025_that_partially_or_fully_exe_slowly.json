The public, media, and advocacy climate is aggressively pro-transparency, especially as the 2026 midterms approach.

Regulatory rollbacks (such as the EPA's elimination of expedited processing for environmental justice FOIA requests) do not count for this question, as they are not statutory changes. The legislative calendar and political cost of passing an explicit FOIA exemption for a cabinet agency or the CIA/EPA are high, with no observable appetite or effort to do so in 2025. The base rate for such legislative action is extremely low, and there are no signs of an emerging push to change that status quo in the remaining time window.

There are no credible reports of active or advancing legislation in either chamber that would create new FOIA exemptions for the listed agencies. Recent agency-level regulatory actions (EPA) affect internal FOIA procedures but do not meet the resolution criteria for this question.

The only plausible route to a Yes is a last-minute, largely concealed rider in a defense or intelligence bill, but there is currently no reporting or legislative evidence of such a move.
