No new legislation or executive orders introducing a licensing/permit requirement for large AI training runs is passed before December 31, 2025.",
            "yes_scenario": "A major, unforeseen AI incident or scandal (e.g., catastrophic misuse traceable directly to a training run) triggers emergency legislative or executive action in California or at the federal level, resulting in a last-minute law or order mandating licenses/permits prior to large training runs. Alternatively, a radical shift in political coalitions or the passage of an unheralded bill occurs in the final months of 2025.",
            "final_reasoning": "The latest and most comprehensive AI laws in California (SB 53, SB 243 and related bills) do not introduce a license or permit regime for training large AI models, focusing instead on transparency, post-training reporting, and incident disclosure. Governor Newsom and legislative leaders have explicitly rejected licensing or pre-training certification, citing innovation and competitiveness concerns. The Advocacy Coalition Framework highlights the dominance of coalitions favoring innovation and flexible regulation, with enough power to prevent stricter licensing from passing despite rising safety and child protection advocacy. Federal rulemaking and international trends are moving toward reporting, not licensing. There is no evidence of imminent legislative or executive action to introduce such a requirement before the end of 2025. Base rates for the U.S. adopting pre-training licensing for new foundational technologies are extremely low. Only a major, unexpected crisis could plausibly trigger a very late reversal, which is highly improbable given the short two-month window and legislative inertia. Therefore, the probability that the US or California will require licenses to train large AI models before 2026 is extremely low.",

SB 53 and related laws, effective January 1, 2026, set robust requirements for post-hoc reporting, not pre-hoc licensing, and are explicitly framed as lighter than the previously vetoed, more stringent bills. High-profile harms have led to rapid content-related regulations (e.g., chatbot safety, age verification), but not to a licensing regime for training. Industry resistance, the risk of a regulatory patchwork, and competitive pressure vis-\u00e0-vis the EU and China all militate against the imposition of licensing in the short term. Crucially, there is no evidence in the extensive news coverage or legal summaries of any law or regulation, either at the California or federal level, requiring a license or permit to train large AI models coming into effect before 2026. The time window is now extremely short, and the actor-network has stabilized around transparency/reporting as the obligatory passage point. Unless there is an unprecedented emergency measure in the next 60 days\u2014a very low base rate event\u2014this question will resolve NO.",
