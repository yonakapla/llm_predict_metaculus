Courts and regulators have shown a strong preference for behavioral remedies, and the timeline for a full breakup is far too short to permit the legal, financial, and operational unwinding of any major Google division, especially with appeals virtually guaranteed. The status quo is reinforced by the complexity of the technology stack, the likely reluctance to disrupt digital ad markets suddenly, and the signals from both the ad tech and search cases. While regulatory momentum is real, and political rhetoric is strong, the actual machinery of government is slow to effectuate structural change of this magnitude, particularly within such a constrained window. The scenario for a 'Yes' outcome would require a historically unprecedented alignment of judicial boldness, bureaucratic speed, and absence of appeal-related delays, all of which are highly improbable.",
