            "no_scenario": "Judge Brinkema issues a remedy in the ad tech case (late 2025 or early 2026) that imposes behavioral or conduct restrictions (such as mandated interoperability, data sharing, oversight, and bans on preferential treatment), but stops short of ordering or completing a structural breakup. Alternatively, if a breakup is ordered, Google immediately appeals, and the remedy is stayed pending the appeals process, which extends well past Jan 1, 2026; no divestiture is completed in time.",
            "yes_scenario": "Judge Brinkema orders the immediate divestiture of key Google ad tech businesses (e.g., AdX, Ad Manager), and Google, under extraordinary circumstances, does not appeal or the appeals process is resolved at record speed, allowing the breakup and reorganization to be fully completed before Jan 1, 2026. This would require an unprecedented acceleration of legal and bureaucratic processes.",
            "final_reasoning": "The dominant status quo in US antitrust enforcement against Big Tech has been strong rhetoric but incremental remedies. The Bureaucratic Politics Model highlights the slow, contested, and multi-actor nature of implementation, especially for truly radical remedies like a forced breakup. While the DOJ is pushing for structural remedies in the ad tech case, all recent signals (including the outcome of the search case and the language of both judges) suggest judicial caution and a preference for behavioral fixes, at least initially. Even if a breakup is ordered, the certainty of appeal\u2014and the courts\u2019 willingness to stay structural remedies pending appeal\u2014makes it virtually impossible for any breakup to be fully completed by Jan 1, 2026. The base rate for completed US tech company breakups (since AT&T, 1984) is near zero. Recent cases (Microsoft, Google Search) reinforce this inertia. The only plausible Yes scenario would require a legal and bureaucratic process moving at extreme speed, against the pattern of decades of precedent. Thus, a No resolution is overwhelmingly likely.",
