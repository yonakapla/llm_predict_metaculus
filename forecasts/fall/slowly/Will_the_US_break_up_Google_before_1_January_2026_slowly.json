            "no_scenario": "Judge Brinkema rules in late 2025 or early 2026 for a combination of behavioral and conduct remedies (e.g., interoperability, transparency, oversight), but does not mandate an immediate structural breakup. Even if structural remedies are ordered, Google appeals, freezing implementation well past January 1, 2026. The DOJ and Google continue to negotiate compliance measures, and Google remains integrated by the resolution date.",
            "yes_scenario": "Judge Brinkema orders Google to divest one or more major business units (e.g., AdX, Ad Manager) in a final ruling before January 1, 2026. Google, under intense political and legal pressure, does not immediately appeal or loses a fast-tracked appeal, and the divestiture is fully executed and completed before the deadline. This would require unprecedented speed and alignment among regulators, courts, and Google itself.",
            "final_reasoning": "While the DOJ is pushing for the breakup of Google's ad tech business, the most recent antitrust precedent (Judge Mehta in the search case) strongly disfavored structural remedies. Judge Brinkema has explicitly instructed parties to consider this precedent, making a similar outcome likely. Even if a breakup were ordered, appeals would almost certainly delay execution well past January 1, 2026. The Bureaucratic Politics Model suggests that legal, bureaucratic, and political inertia (compounded by election-year distractions) will favor incremental, reversible remedies over rapid, irreversible corporate breakups. There is currently no evidence of the necessary bureaucratic alignment or judicial urgency to overcome these hurdles in the extremely short time remaining. The base rate for a major, fully completed tech breakup within 3 months is close to zero. Therefore, the probability of the US breaking up Google by January 1, 2026, is extremely low.",
