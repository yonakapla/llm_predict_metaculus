            "no_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if, before January 1, 2026, a federal law (such as the Farm Bill with a Prop 12 preemption provision) is passed and signed into law, or if a court grants a nationwide injunction or otherwise suspends any provision of Prop 12. For example, if the Save Our Bacon Act or similar language is attached to an omnibus or continuing resolution that passes during the current government funding turmoil, or if a surprise court injunction emerges from ongoing litigation (such as the Triumph Foods suit), Prop 12 would be at least partially nullified and the question resolves No.",
            "yes_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome arises if Prop 12 remains in full effect on January 1, 2026, with no successful federal preemption, court injunction, or state-level repeal or suspension. This would be the case if (as base rates suggest) the Farm Bill either fails to pass before the deadline, passes without a Prop 12 override, or if litigation does not result in a stay or injunction before January 1, 2026. Ongoing industry compliance, sustained public support, and absence of new legal blocks would allow the law to remain fully in force.",
            "final_reasoning": "The status quo remains robust: Prop 12 has withstood nine legal challenges, including at the Supreme Court (twice), and has significant industry compliance. Current news shows growing opposition to federal preemption from both parties and industry segments, with 14 House Republicans recently opposing the SOB Act and Farm Bill Prop 12 override, citing threats to states' rights, family farmers, and US food sovereignty. The Farm Bill is stalled in a divided Congress amid a government shutdown and broader partisan gridlock. Even if the Farm Bill advances, adding controversial preemption language would likely fracture the fragile coalition needed for passage and risks backlash from invested industry players and a pro-animal-welfare public. Meanwhile, ongoing lawsuits (such as Triumph Foods) are unlikely to resolve before January 2026, given the glacial pace of federal litigation, especially after repeated appellate and Supreme Court rebuffs. Importantly, many large producers are already compliant, and the economic impact of Prop 12 is now largely absorbed. The animal welfare science perspective underscores that industry adaptation to new welfare standards typically creates strong path dependency, making reversals rare and destabilizing. Given these converging factors\u2014legal precedent, industry compliance, political gridlock, and strong public/industry support\u2014the probability that Prop 12 is still fully in effect on January 1, 2026, is high, but not absolute due to the small but real risk of last-minute legislative horse-trading or unforeseen court intervention.",
