The cap could be justified as a 'guardrail' to control spending, either as a strict dollar cap or as a volume cap (e.g., maximum output eligible per taxpayer).

However, the current context is exceptional: 1) There is unified Republican control with an explicit agenda to cut spending on climate and clean energy, 2) The uncapped nature of 45X has become a prominent target for criticism, 3) Recent major tax legislation (OBBBA) has shown that clean energy tax credits can be sharply curtailed or terminated early, and 4) budget scoring will make 45X's open-ended cost a tempting target for caps, especially as the fiscal impact becomes clearer. On the other hand, the OBBBA and reporting to date suggest restrictions have focused more on eligibility and phase-out acceleration rather than explicit caps. There is no clear reporting in the news articles or legislative summaries that a cap on 45X is being actively advanced or has political momentum in the current Congress, even as FEOC and eligibility changes are prioritized. The business lobby is also likely to push hard against caps, and there is precedent for simply tightening eligibility instead. Taking these factors together, and giving appropriate weight to the status quo (no explicit cap yet, and the most recent sweeping legislation did not impose one), I judge the probability of a cap being enacted before January 1, 2026 to be elevated but not greater than even odds.",

There is clear evidence of GOP interest in containing costs, with Axios and Cato noting that caps are under discussion, but legislative focus has thus far been on eligibility tightening (FEOC, etc.), not explicit caps. The window for legislative action is narrow; historical precedent suggests phase-outs or eligibility restrictions are more politically viable than outright caps.
