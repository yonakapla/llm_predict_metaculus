Still, the ICJ\u2019s procedural hurdle\u2014requiring respondent consent\u2014remains a powerful brake, and news coverage indicates that some key potential cases (Mali-Algeria) are stalled for lack of consent.

The Mali-Algeria case illustrates the typical pattern: without mutual consent, the ICJ cannot proceed, and the process stalls. While multipolarity and UNSC paralysis make legal avenues more attractive for weaker states, the practical obstacles to registering a new ICJ case in the last three weeks of the year are significant. Current news does not indicate imminent new filings, and most ongoing crises are either already before the Court, before the ICC (which is separate), or mired in procedural delay.
