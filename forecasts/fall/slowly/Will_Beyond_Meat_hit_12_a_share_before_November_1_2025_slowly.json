However, the window is very short (just 5 days), and the most recent, record-breaking squeeze only reached $7.69\u2014despite all the key ingredients (short interest, meme attention, retail volume, news catalysts, ETF inclusion) aligning at once. The dilution has increased the share count, which actually reduces the magnitude of future squeezes, as more shares must be bought to trigger the same price move. Additionally, the momentum has faded sharply, with the stock closing below $3 after the hype died down. There is no fundamental reason for a $12 print, and technical resistance plus exhausted retail buying power make it unlikely. Still, the possibility of an irrational, meme-driven blowoff top can't be dismissed outright, as microcap floats can be cornered by coordinated buying. Given the extremely short timeline and the evidence that the last squeeze fell short of $12 even with perfect conditions, I assign a low but nonzero probability.",

With less than a week left, and no new major catalyst or viral campaign apparent, the likelihood of another >5x move is extremely slim, especially as regulatory and trading friction increases. The core consumer adoption curve for plant-based meat is flattening or declining, so fundamentals do not support even a temporary spike.
