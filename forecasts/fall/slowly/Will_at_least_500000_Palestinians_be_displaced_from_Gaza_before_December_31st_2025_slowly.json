This would require either the Egyptian regime deciding that the political/military risk of refusing entry is greater than accepting refugees, or losing control of the border (e.g., due to state collapse or invasion). Alternatively, a catastrophic breakdown in international order (e.g., US withdrawal, global distraction) allows Israel to expel large numbers and Egypt reluctantly acquiesces.",

While the humanitarian situation is desperate and Israeli policy preferences are clear, realpolitik, regional balancing, and the risk of regime-splitting instability in Egypt outweigh the push factors. Ceasefire agreements, international monitoring, and the explicit inclusion of anti-displacement clauses further decrease the probability. Only a black swan event (Egyptian state collapse, extreme escalation, or total international distraction) would make this outcome likely, and there is no evidence that such an event is imminent. Thus, the probability of 500,000+ Palestinians being displaced from Gaza into Egypt or elsewhere before December 31, 2025 is very low, but not absolutely zero given long-tail risks.",

The international legal environment (ICJ, ICC) and the threat of wider regional destabilization (including the risk to Egypt\u2019s regime stability, Israel-Egypt peace, and wider Arab normalization processes) all militate against a scenario where 500,000+ cross into Egypt or elsewhere from Gaza.
