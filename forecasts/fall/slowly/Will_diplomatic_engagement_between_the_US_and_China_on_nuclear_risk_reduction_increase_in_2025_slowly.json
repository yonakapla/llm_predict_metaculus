Historically, even amid high tensions, adversaries have sought to avoid catastrophic miscalculation via CBMs and risk reduction talks, especially when approaching key treaty deadlines (like New START in February 2026). China remains reluctant to enter formal arms control negotiations, but is likely to agree to at least minimal discussions, particularly if tied to broader military-to-military communication or as a diplomatic gesture ahead of major summits. Leadership volatility in the U.S. (Trump's unpredictability) is a drag, but not a total barrier\u2014ad hoc and opportunistic engagement remains possible. The base rate of some form of CBM or risk reduction contact in periods of crisis is high. Therefore, despite strong headwinds, the probability that 2025 will see an increase in diplomatic engagement\u2014defined broadly as new or more frequent discussions\u2014between the U.S. and China on nuclear risk reduction is modestly above the status quo, but not high enough to justify an extreme probability.

The New START extension talks remain US-Russia-centric, and trilateral efforts stall.",
            "yes_scenario": "Given the looming expiration of New START and the rapid expansion of China\u2019s arsenal, both sides face mounting pressure to at least signal engagement. The U.S. and China agree to a new round of crisis management talks, or a Track 1.5/2 dialogue is officially acknowledged (e.g., military-to-military communication improvements, working groups on nuclear risk reduction, or inclusion in broader strategic stability forums). Alternatively, U.S.-Russia negotiations on New START extension include China in observer or consultative roles, with acknowledgment by at least one party.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for increased U.S.-China nuclear risk diplomacy is low, given decades of Chinese reluctance and the intermittent, often symbolic nature of past dialogues. The Trump administration\u2019s arms control skepticism further dampens prospects. However, several factors push probability upward: (1) the rapid expansion of China\u2019s arsenal and global concern about a new arms race; (2) the impending New START expiration, which raises the profile of trilateral or broader talks; (3) recent signs of cautious military-to-military engagement and bipartisan U.S. congressional visits to China, where nuclear risk was reportedly discussed; and (4) the broad resolution criteria, which permit the question to resolve Yes on the basis of even modest, acknowledged exchanges or Track 1.5/2 dialogues. The news does not indicate any major new breakthrough, but it does document small but real openings in military dialogue and a recognition on both sides of the dangers of miscalculation. Given the low threshold for a Yes resolution and the presence of recent, acknowledged contacts that could plausibly expand or recur before year-end, the probability is notably higher than the historical base rate, but caution is warranted given the structural impediments and volatility around Taiwan. Taking all this into account, I assess the probability that diplomatic engagement between the U.S. and China on nuclear risk reduction will increase in 2025 at 68%.",

The Taiwan issue, arms sales to Taipei, or U.S. military moves lead China to freeze even technical contacts. No joint statements, frameworks, or new working groups are announced.",

Alternatively, military-to-military talks resume at the working level (e.g., defense policy consultations, hotline usage) and include explicit discussion of nuclear risk, with a summary statement or media report confirming nuclear issues were addressed. Even absent a formal agreement, such developments suffice under the resolution criteria.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for new, substantive U.S.-China nuclear risk reduction engagement is low, due to decades of Chinese reluctance and the deepening rivalry. However, the bar for a Yes resolution is not high: any formally acknowledged Track 1.5/2 dialogue or official meeting that substantially discusses nuclear risk counts. Recent reporting indicates Beijing is at least open to de-escalation dialogue at the working level, partly to manage crisis risks in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea. While the Trump administration is less likely to prioritize arms control, the persistence of Congressional, expert, and allied pressure\u2014and the urgency of the New START expiration\u2014raise the probability of at least minimal engagement. Given Chinese signaling about de-escalation and resumption of certain military contacts, plus the relatively low bar for question resolution, the likelihood of at least a modest increase in engagement over 2024 is above the base rate, but not overwhelmingly so. The main risk is that a Taiwan crisis or new U.S. arms sale derails even minimal contacts. Taking all factors into account, and given that the window for engagement in 2025 is still open (with possible APEC or Track 1.5 meetings forthcoming), I assess the probability of increased U.S.-China diplomatic engagement on nuclear risk reduction in 2025 at 62%.",
