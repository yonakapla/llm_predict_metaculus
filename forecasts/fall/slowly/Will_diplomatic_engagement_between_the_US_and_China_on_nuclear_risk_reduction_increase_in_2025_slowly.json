However, Chinese resistance to arms control talks, the Trump administration's preference for nuclear expansion and erratic diplomacy, and the risk environment around Taiwan are strong headwinds. The most plausible path to a 'Yes' is a Track 1.5 dialogue with official acknowledgment or a minimal bilateral working group meeting, possibly catalyzed by a crisis or as part of a broader multilateral effort (e.g., in the context of New START extension discussions). On balance, while the odds are below even chance, the CBM expert must weigh the low but real precedent for minimal engagement and the incentives on both sides to avoid uncontrolled escalation.

Instead, relations remain tense, dialogue is suspended (e.g., after a Taiwan Strait incident or U.S. arms sale to Taiwan), and both sides prioritize military signaling and deterrence over engagement. Even if some technical or military communications occur, they are not acknowledged as relating to nuclear risk reduction and do not meet the criteria.",

This could be a technical working group, a side meeting at a multilateral event, or even a bilateral call between senior defense officials. The engagement may be limited and symbolic, but meets the resolution criteria by being both acknowledged and involving nuclear risk reduction topics.",

The current context\u2014rising tensions, Chinese nuclear buildup, an unstable arms control landscape, and heightened global nuclear anxiety\u2014creates both risks and incentives for engagement. While the Trump administration is less likely to prioritize or institutionalize dialogue, the mutual risk of miscalculation (especially in the Taiwan Strait/South China Sea) and the recent September 2025 Congressional delegation to China (with signals of openness to military communication) suggest space for at least one limited engagement. The historical base rate supports the likelihood of at least minimal dialogue in most years, even when overall relations are poor. However, the probability is not overwhelming, given Chinese reluctance and unpredictable U.S. policy. The most likely scenario is a narrowly focused, technical, or semi-official meeting on crisis communications or risk reduction\u2014not a broad or durable process, but enough to resolve the question as 'Yes.'",

Any technical dialogues that occur are not officially acknowledged by both sides or are too limited in scope to be deemed an increase by reputable expert organizations, resulting in the question resolving No.",

Even if progress is limited, the fact of increased engagement (relative to 2024) is confirmed by at least one government or expert body, satisfying the resolution criteria.",

Recent reporting indicates that Beijing is tentatively exploring re-opening military communication channels\u2014albeit conditionally\u2014and Congressional delegations have met with Chinese defense officials to discuss de-escalation. The Biden administration managed to restore some technical dialogues in 2024, and although these remain fragile, the habit of minimal engagement may persist, especially as the New START deadline and China\u2019s arsenal expansion loom. The risk of accidental escalation (e.g., in the Taiwan Strait) creates some mutual incentive for minimal risk reduction steps, even if substantive arms control is off the table. Taking all this into account, and adjusting for the strong status quo bias but the relatively low threshold for 'increase' in the resolution criteria, the probability is modestly above 50%. I assign a 62% chance that the U.S. and China will have (or acknowledge) at least one new or expanded engagement on nuclear risk reduction by the end of 2025.",
