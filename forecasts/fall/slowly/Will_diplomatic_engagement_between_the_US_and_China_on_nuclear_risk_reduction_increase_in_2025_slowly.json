There are some positive signals: bipartisan U.S. Congress visits to China, Chinese leaders expressing openness to military communication, and the strategic context of looming New START expiration, which both the U.S. and Russia are leveraging to encourage Chinese involvement. The high level of global nuclear anxiety and pressure from the international community could further nudge both sides toward at least symbolic engagement, especially as even minimal risk reduction dialogue is perceived as valuable. Nevertheless, major obstacles remain, including mutual suspicion, the Taiwan issue, and the unpredictability of U.S. leadership under Trump. Still, given the low bar for question resolution (Track 1.5/2 dialogue, working group, or joint statement acknowledged by one side), the probability of at least a modest uptick in engagement is meaningfully above the base rate.

Recent Congressional delegations and minimal technical dialogues in late 2024/2025 suggest that both sides remain willing to keep a minimal channel open, especially to prevent accidents in the Indo-Pacific. The Trump administration\u2019s focus on Russia and skepticism toward arms control lowers the probability of high-level engagement, but the risk of being blamed for global instability and the desire to avoid an unregulated arms race ahead of New START\u2019s expiry could prompt at least a token or technical-level engagement. China\u2019s reluctance is a major drag, but its interest in projecting responsibility and managing crisis risk may motivate minimal participation, especially if the U.S. frames talks around crisis management rather than arms control per se. Given these countervailing factors, and the broad resolution criteria, the probability of seeing at least one increase in diplomatic engagement (even if superficial) is meaningfully above the base rate, but not overwhelming.

However, persistent Chinese reluctance, conditionality on broader US-China relations (especially over Taiwan), and the volatility of US policy under Trump weigh against sustained or deep engagement. The news shows cautious openings (Congressional delegation, Chinese defense minister's non-confrontational tone, technical channels tested), but also reiterates China's opposition to trilateral arms control and the fragility of these contacts. Given the low bar for a YES, but recognizing the possibility that even these minimal contacts could break down or not be officially acknowledged, I judge the probability to be moderately high, but not certain.

Chinese officials remain wary and condition progress on U.S. behavior (especially on Taiwan), but are no longer flatly refusing all engagement. The Trump administration is unpredictable and ideologically opposed to arms control in some respects, but Trump himself has expressed openness to talks (with Russia, and possibly including China), and institutional actors (Pentagon, Congress, Track 2 community) are likely to keep some channels open.

Alternatively, a new joint statement or framework on nuclear risk is announced, even if limited in scope or substance. This could arise out of a broader U.S.-China diplomatic thaw, or as a side effect of technical talks to avoid military accidents.",
            "final_reasoning": "The historical base rate for major, sustained increases in U.S.-China nuclear risk reduction engagement is very low. Recent news shows some resumption of military communication, but these steps are fragile, contingent, and easily suspended. The Trump administration is focused on U.S.-Russia arms control, with only vague gestures toward including China, which Beijing has rebuffed. China's continued nuclear expansion and Taiwan tensions further reduce incentives for Beijing to engage in meaningful new dialogues. However, the resolution criteria are relatively permissive: even one official meeting, or an acknowledged Track 1.5 dialogue, would suffice for a 'Yes.' Given the recent Congressional delegation visit and ongoing advocacy for crisis management channels, a minimal increase (e.g., a new working group meeting or technical dialogue) is plausible. Yet, the political environment remains highly adverse, and neither side is signaling a clear readiness for substantive engagement. Weighing these factors, I assess the probability of a qualifying increase in 2025 at 35%.",

In 2025, following Trump's inauguration, U.S.-China engagement has not sharply increased, but there have been some signs of renewed contacts, including a recent bipartisan U.S. congressional visit and Chinese expressions of willingness to discuss risk reduction if 'conditions created by the U.S.' are favorable.",

Official statements from both sides confirm a freeze, and no Track 1.5/2 meetings are acknowledged by either government.",

One side publicly acknowledges the meeting (as happened in 2023). Alternatively, during Trump-Xi or lower-level summits, both sides issue a joint statement or fact sheet referencing nuclear risk reduction or crisis management. Even absent a comprehensive agreement, an officially acknowledged meeting or dialogue is sufficient for a 'Yes.'",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates for new, formal, high-level arms control with China are low; however, the resolution criteria only require some credible, officially acknowledged engagement, including at the working level or in Track 1.5/2 settings. Recent news (September 2025) confirms that U.S. Congressional delegations met with Chinese defense officials, who expressed cautious willingness to strengthen communication channels. Although China conditions deeper engagement on U.S. restraint over Taiwan, the momentum for at least minimal, officially acknowledged engagement is present\u2014especially as China seeks to avoid blame for instability and the U.S. (under Trump) seeks diplomatic wins, possibly even involving Russia. The risk of derailment from Taiwan tensions or a major crisis is real, but barring a major incident, the low bar for qualifying engagement means a 'Yes' is more likely than not. My expert view is that both sides, despite deep mistrust, have a shared interest in avoiding accidental escalation and will seek to maintain at least minimal risk reduction dialogues, especially given international pressure and the looming expiration of New START.",
