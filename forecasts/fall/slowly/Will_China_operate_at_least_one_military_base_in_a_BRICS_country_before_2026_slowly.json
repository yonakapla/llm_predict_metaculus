The latest reporting reiterates strategic dual use but lacks official acknowledgment or high-confidence intelligence claims. Other BRICS states (India, Brazil, South Africa) are unlikely to allow PLA basing; new entrants (e.g., Iran, UAE) have security ties but no direct evidence of imminent basing, and Sudan\u2019s recent proposal is to Russia, not China. The US and Western intelligence remain alert, and would likely announce if a PLA base were clearly established.

There is mounting evidence (e.g., restricted zones, berthing capacity for warships, smart surveillance, airstrips for drones) that facilities like Gwadar could be converted to full military use on short notice. However, the threshold for public or intelligence acknowledgment as an overt 'base' remains high unless China or the host is compelled to admit it."

            "no_scenario": "Despite continued expansion and militarization of dual-use infrastructure in ports such as Gwadar (Pakistan), Ream (Cambodia), or elsewhere, neither China nor the US intelligence community publicly acknowledges the operation of an official Chinese military base in any BRICS country by January 1, 2026. China continues to rely on proxy arrangements, commercial cover, and plausible deniability, and any military presence remains below the threshold of formal, indefinite operation required for question resolution.",

This might be triggered by a regional crisis, a leak, or a deliberate policy shift by Beijing or a host government (e.g., as a quid pro quo for debt relief or arms sales), leading to a formal announcement or US intelligence determination meeting the 'high likelihood' threshold.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates, strategic culture, and open-source evidence all suggest that China\u2019s preferred method is to establish dual-use facilities with latent military potential, gradually normalizing its presence until circumstances (crisis, host pressure, or strategic necessity) tip the balance toward open acknowledgment. The news shows clear progress toward militarization of infrastructure in states like Pakistan, but not the crossing of the critical threshold for public acknowledgment as a military base by either Beijing or US intelligence. The US and China have strong incentives to avoid a public declaration that would escalate tensions and set new precedents before 2026, especially given the looming Taiwan timeline and the risk of regional backlash. While the expansion of BRICS and ongoing debt and dependency in key host states marginally increase risk, the historical base rate for new Chinese military bases outside Djibouti in the last decade is near zero, and the evidence for a formal, acknowledged base in a BRICS country remains circumstantial. Thus, while the probability is higher than in previous years, and the infrastructure is 'base-ready,' the threshold for question resolution is unlikely to be met in the next month.",
