However, the most recent mass protests peaked at 500,000 (official), with subsequent protests showing diminishing returns. Unions are capable of scaling up if a major trigger occurs, such as a budget passed by decree or an unpopular snap election, but absent such a trigger, there is evidence of protest fatigue and tactical de-escalation from both government and unions. The Ministry\u2019s conservative counting is a key constraint. Thus, while the risk is elevated above normal due to the crisis and historical precedent, the lack of a scheduled maximalist protest and recent downward trend in turnout suggests it is somewhat less likely than not.
