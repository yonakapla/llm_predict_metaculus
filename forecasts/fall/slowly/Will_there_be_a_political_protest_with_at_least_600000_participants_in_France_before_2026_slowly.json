However, the sharp drop to 195,000 on October 2 suggests momentum decay, common in protest cycles unless a new escalation occurs. The window for another spike is narrowing due to seasonality and a lack of scheduled national actions. Still, the unresolved budget crisis, ongoing government instability, and the threat of parliamentary dissolution or further austerity could provide the necessary trigger. Given the mix of high baseline discontent and recent trend toward lower turnout, I estimate the probability as moderately above the historical base rate, but not extreme.

However, the official Ministry of the Interior figures have not crossed 600,000 in recent years, even during major mobilizations; unions' higher counts do not resolve this question. Diminishing returns and lack of immediate wins may further demobilize the base unless a dramatic triggering event (e.g., severe budget cuts, violent repression, or snap elections) occurs before year's end. The most likely scenario is continued unrest at a lower plateau, with unions preserving their capacity for future escalation. Thus, while a spike is possible, the base rate and recent turnout suggest it is more likely that no single protest will officially reach 600,000 before January.

Since then, turnout has declined and unions are struggling to maintain momentum, with the last official count at 195,000. Organizational capacity remains high, and the political context is still unstable, but without a new major provocation, it is unlikely turnout will suddenly increase enough to breach 600,000 by official count. Base rates suggest such large protests are rare even in France, and the Ministry of the Interior's official numbers tend to be more conservative than union counts. However, the risk of sudden escalation remains: any new, highly unpopular government action or violent repression could reignite mass mobilization.
