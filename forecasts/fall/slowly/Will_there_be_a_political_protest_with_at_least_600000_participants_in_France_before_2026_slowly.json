Unions acknowledge declining participation and have not announced new protest dates. However, the situation remains volatile: a government misstep (e.g., 49.3, drastic cuts, or snap elections) could spark one more massive mobilization. Still, the window for organizing such a protest is narrowing, and with winter and the holiday season approaching, the logistical and motivational barriers to another surge are rising.

Historically, France has occasionally seen official protest numbers over 600,000, particularly during moments of acute crisis. Given the high volatility, but also the clear signs of declining protest momentum and the rarity of such large official counts, I estimate a modestly elevated probability relative to the base rate but do not go to extremes. The most likely scenario is continued unrest with sub-threshold protests; the main risk factor for a Yes outcome is a fresh, highly provocative government move before year-end.",

However, several factors temper this: the official count is consistently lower than union estimates; recent protests show declining momentum; and the historical base rate for official counts exceeding 600,000 is low, even during intense contentious cycles.

The trend shows declining momentum, but political instability, an unresolved budget crisis, and the possibility of new austerity measures or elections create a non-trivial chance of renewed mobilization. Collective action theory suggests that protest waves can spike again if a new, clear threat or opportunity emerges, but absent a sharp exogenous shock, the status quo bias and demobilization after repeated actions tend to prevail. Considering the short time frame left, institutional resistance to reporting high numbers, protest fatigue, and seasonal effects, I assess the probability as moderately low but not negligible. The base rate for 600,000+ official turnout protests in France is low in recent years (even the 2023 pension protests barely hit this threshold by official counts).
