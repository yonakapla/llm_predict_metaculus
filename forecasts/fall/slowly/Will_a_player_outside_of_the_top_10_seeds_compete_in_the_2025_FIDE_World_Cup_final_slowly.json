The 2023 edition\u2019s final four included two players well outside the top 10. This year, the field is even deeper with prodigies and wildcards, and several top 10 mainstays (Carlsen, Nakamura, Caruana) are absent, further lowering the overall dominance of the elite. While the top 10 still enjoy structural advantages (byes, bracket clustering), this is offset by the inherent volatility of the format and the demonstrated ability of outsiders to break through. Considering all factors\u2014including base rates, format, player absences, and field depth\u2014I assess the probability of at least one finalist being seeded outside the top 10 as moderately high, but not extreme, given that the bracket and byes still favor the elite. Therefore, the probability should be bold but not maximal.",

The top 10 still have structural bracket advantages and byes, but historical base rates, the current competitive landscape, and the specific format combine to make it more likely than not that at least one World Cup finalist will be seeded outside the top 10.
