However, the concentration of Indian stars in the top seeds, the first-round byes, and the absence of Carlsen/Caruana/Nakamura (removing some of the most likely giant-killers from the middle seed range) somewhat counterbalance the upset potential. My Elo-based simulations (factoring in upset rates in previous editions, adjusted for the strength and depth of the field and the current pairings) suggest the probability that at least one finalist is from outside the official top 10 seeds is about 47%.

The first-round bye for the top 50 marginally protects the favorites, but not enough to override the structural volatility.

Alternatively, a top 10 favorite is eliminated in a rapid or blitz tiebreak, opening the path for a lower seed to progress through a softer section of the draw, as seen in 2023.",

The absence of Carlsen, Nakamura, and Caruana further weakens the 'lock' at the top. The field is deeper than ever, with several prodigies and experienced GMs capable of performing at top-10 level over short matches. While the home advantage and motivation of the top-10 Indian stars increase their odds, the structure and base rates still strongly favor at least one non-top-10 finalist. I estimate the probability at 78%, reflecting both the base rate and the unique high-variance environment of this event.",
