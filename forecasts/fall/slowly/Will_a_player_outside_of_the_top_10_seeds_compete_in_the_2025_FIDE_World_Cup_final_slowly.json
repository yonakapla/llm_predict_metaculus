The current field is strong at the top, but with Carlsen, Nakamura, and Caruana absent, the remaining top seeds, while talented, are less dominant relative to the field. The bye system gives the top 10 a head start, but the high-variance match structure and the sheer number of talented lower seeds (Nepomniachtchi, Dubov, Esipenko, Rapport, etc.) mean an upset run is more likely than in a round-robin or longer classical event.

The byes for top seeds help, but not enough to offset the risks posed by the format's variance and the depth of the field. The base rate for this outcome in recent years is well above 50%. Factoring in all uncertainties and the incentives for bold but well-justified forecasting, I assign a probability on the higher end\u2014reflecting both historical data and the unique 2025 context.",

Chess, like other high-performance sports, is deeply affected by the knockout format's inherent randomness, the psychological stamina required to repeatedly perform at peak, and the strategic implications of time controls and tiebreaks. These elements directly inform the likelihood of upsets and deep runs by lower-seeded competitors.",

Recent history indicates that lower-seeded players are increasingly competitive, with young talents on the rise (e.g., Mishra, Woodward, Murzin, Nepomniachtchi, Dubov, etc.). The base rate of a non-top-10 finalist over recent cycles is roughly 50%, and the current field\u2019s volatility and withdrawals are higher than normal. From a PeakPerformanceModel perspective, fatigue, stress, and momentum swings are likely to benefit underdogs, especially in the tiebreaks.
