He is strongly identified with the current unpopular party establishment and lacks grassroots enthusiasm. Base rates indicate Labour members rarely choose technocratic or centrist compromise figures unless the left is badly fragmented and no charismatic left or unity candidate is available. Current polling, recent leadership contests, and the instant-runoff system all make Streeting an outsider. The only plausible path is a highly fractured contest with an absence of stronger left or soft left figures, which current signals do not support. Thus, the probability that Wes Streeting is the next Labour leader is very low.",
