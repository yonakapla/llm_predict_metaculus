Furthermore, there is no imminent leadership contest, and Starmer\u2019s incumbency is a powerful brake on internal coups, especially so soon after a general election victory (even with declining polls). Streeting\u2019s low net favorability (+9) and the lack of a pressing, unifying crisis around which he could emerge as the compromise candidate further reduce his chances.

The procedural hurdles (nomination thresholds, union support, constituency party nominations) favor figures like Mahmood, Miliband, or potentially Burnham if he becomes an MP. The only plausible path for Streeting is as a compromise candidate in a fractured field, but this scenario is less probable than a win by candidates with higher network centrality and popularity. The status quo and base rates further reinforce this: few Labour leaders in recent decades have emerged from Streeting's current relative position without exceptional circumstances.

The party selectorate is currently restless and more likely to turn to a charismatic or consensus figure (Burnham, Miliband, or even Mahmood).

Labour leadership contests are typically dominated by candidates with broad union support, high MP backing, or strong grassroots enthusiasm. Streeting, as a moderate with some media profile, could benefit if the field is fractured and no single candidate unites the left or the establishment, but the presence of stronger front-runners makes this unlikely. The status quo inertia (no contest yet), high procedural hurdles, and the lack of evidence of a Streeting surge all combine to keep his chances low, though not zero.
