Instead, pressure is exerted through bureaucratic obstacles, legal threats, and possibly new requirements to return home for document renewal, but with no credible sources reporting a nationwide or large-scale (1000+) revocation policy before January 1, 2026.",
            "yes_scenario": "Mounting desperation over manpower shortfalls, domestic anger over men avoiding mobilization, and sustained battlefield losses push Ukraine to announce a new policy: all draft-age men abroad without up-to-date military registration will have their existing passports declared void or revoked, with the policy publicly described as affecting at least 1,000 individuals. This is reported by credible outlets and confirmed by official statements.",

The legal, diplomatic, and administrative risks of mass passport revocation make it an extreme and unprecedented step, especially as most men abroad are in the EU, whose governments would object strongly. Ukraine has shown some flexibility (allowing 18-22 year olds to travel), suggesting a nuanced approach balancing control with international image. There is no credible evidence of imminent revocation, and the recent news focus is on registration and travel/renewal restrictions, not mass cancellation. The base rate for European states revoking passports of citizens abroad en masse for draft evasion is extremely low. Given the time left (less than three months), it is likely Ukraine continues with its current policy mix without escalating to mass revocations. Overall, the probability of a Yes outcome is low, but not zero given the ongoing war and political risks.",

There is strong incentive to keep this approach: it is effective, less diplomatically risky, and aligns with Ukraine's need for continued EU support. Legal, administrative, and political costs of revoking passports are high, and no precedent exists for such a draconian measure in the region. While mobilization pressures and domestic discontent could push for harsher measures, the government has recently liberalized some rules (such as for 18-22 year olds), and the focus remains on registration and documentation, not revocation. Russian propaganda has inflated fears of revocation, but no credible evidence indicates imminent policy change. If anything, Ukraine is likely to maintain or modestly escalate existing restrictions rather than leap to mass passport revocation.
