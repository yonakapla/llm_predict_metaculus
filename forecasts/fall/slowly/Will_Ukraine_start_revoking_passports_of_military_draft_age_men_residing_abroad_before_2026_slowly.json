From an international law perspective, such a move risks violating international obligations, provoking diplomatic disputes, and undermining Ukraine's image among allies and host countries. The administrative hurdles are considerable, and there is no precedent or credible report suggesting that such a policy is imminent. The status quo, with continued service denials and registration requirements, is likely to persist as the preferred pressure approach, especially given the limited time left before question resolution. The absence of credible media reports or official statements suggesting movement toward a mass revocation policy further lowers the probability. Base rates for such state behavior are exceedingly low, even under wartime conditions. Therefore, the probability that Ukraine will start revoking passports of military draft-age men abroad before 2026 remains very low.",

The risk of significant diplomatic, economic, and reputational backlash remains high. While Ukraine's mobilization needs are acute, the government\u2019s recent moves (e.g., restoring travel rights to certain age groups, digitalizing registration) suggest a preference for 'soft pressure' over extreme, legally dubious measures.
