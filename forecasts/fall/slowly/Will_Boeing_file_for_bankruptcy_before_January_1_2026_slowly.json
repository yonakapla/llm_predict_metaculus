While Boeing's financials remain highly stressed\u2014Z-score in the distress zone, negative margins, and high debt\u2014the company has stabilized operations with increased deliveries, recovered regulatory trust, and a path to profitability projected for 2026. Its $600B+ backlog, duopoly market position, and strategic government importance further reduce acute bankruptcy risk. The most recent news (FAA production hike, improved deliveries, narrowing losses) all points to stabilization. The only plausible bankruptcy path before January 1, 2026, would be a sudden, severe, and unexpected shock\u2014none is currently visible in the news or macro environment. I weight the status quo heavily, with a small allowance for tail risk given the financial distress indicators, but the probability of bankruptcy before January 1, 2026, remains very low.",
