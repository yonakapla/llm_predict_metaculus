The only significant recent moves to add domestic content rules have been for 45Z\u2014where there was a clear trade and supply chain rationale and strong Midwestern farmer/biofuel lobbying. No news articles or legislative trackers indicate a similar push for 45X, and the tax law community has not flagged this in recent guidance plans. Additionally, the legislative calendar is extremely tight, and Congress is consumed by fights over ACA subsidies, government funding, and layoffs, leaving little room for technical amendments to 45X. Industry and lobbyists are focused on preserving credits, not adding restrictions. Therefore, the base rate for such a change is very low, and the news provides no evidence of an imminent shift.

Furthermore, business lobbies, including the API, are actively warning against domestic-only requirements due to insufficient U.S. supply chains. While poll data shows strong public support for American manufacturing, the actual legislative record points toward retrenchment rather than regulatory expansion.

            "no_scenario": "The government continues to focus on rolling back, phasing out, or eliminating IRA clean energy tax credits (including 45X), with no new domestic content requirements added before Jan 1, 2026. The legislative focus remains on budget battles, ACA tax credits, and broader spending cuts. Any changes to 45X are in the direction of reduction, not expansion or new conditions.",
            "yes_scenario": "In the course of budget reconciliation or a compromise bill, Congress passes a provision (possibly buried in a larger tax or manufacturing package) that adds a domestic content or subcomponent requirement for 45X credits, either to appease nationalist economic factions or as a tradeoff for extending or preserving some portion of the credit. This would likely be modeled on the 45Z feedstock restriction, but for advanced manufacturing.",
            "final_reasoning": "Applying Punctuated Equilibrium Theory, the base rate for major policy changes\u2014especially new restrictions added to tax credits during periods of retrenchment\u2014is quite low. All available news points to retrenchment (phaseouts, repeals, and spending cuts), not expansion or new requirements. The only relevant precedent (45Z feedstock) was in the context of a new credit extension, not a new restriction. The high legislative friction, slim majority, and crowded agenda further lower the odds. While nationalist rhetoric and some public support for 'Buy American' exist, the immediate pressure is on cost-cutting, not on attaching new strings to surviving tax credits. The scenario for a Yes outcome would require a last-minute, possibly opaque, insertion of a domestic content clause\u2014something that would be controversial among business lobbies and is not currently reported as being under serious consideration. Given all these factors, the probability that 45X will start requiring use of domestic materials or subcomponents in 2025 is low, but not zero. I set the probability at 8%, reflecting a small tail risk due to nationalist rhetoric and the recent 45Z precedent.",
