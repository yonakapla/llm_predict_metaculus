However, the 5% threshold in the Bundestag for introducing a vote has reportedly been met, and SPD/Green/Left mobilization is stronger than in previous years. With only about 2.5 months left, the time window is tight, but not impossible if political momentum overcomes bureaucratic inertia. On balance, while the probability is significantly higher than the historical base rate, the combination of legal caution, divided opinion, and time constraints means a 'No' outcome remains more likely, but the chance of a last-minute application is non-negligible.

The legal standard is extremely high, and the ongoing legal challenge to the BfV's classification creates practical uncertainty. The status quo bias is strong: Germany's party system has historically preferred containing extremist parties through political means rather than outright bans, especially for parties with large electoral support. Public opinion remains firmly against a ban, and key actors within the political establishment (e.g., CDU/CSU, some SPD moderates) continue to warn about the risks. The time window is short, and while groundwork is being laid, it is more likely that the process will remain in the 'preparatory' stage through the remainder of 2025.

However, strong headwinds remain: public opinion is mostly against a ban, elite consensus is lacking (with key CDU/CSU figures opposed), and the legal and procedural bar to both preparing and submitting a viable application is extremely high. Historically, party bans are rare and take years, not months, to reach the application stage. The window is very short (2.5 months) and, absent a major trigger event or sudden consensus, the status quo bias in German constitutional politics is powerful. Nonetheless, the unusually intense and coordinated SPD activity, and the BfV's escalation, mean the probability is not negligible\u2014higher than in most previous cycles.

The Court\u2019s requirements are daunting, and the risks of political backlash and legal defeat are well known and highly salient to party leaders.

Moreover, the BfV classification is under legal challenge, providing a plausible pretext for procedural delay. With roughly 2.5 months left, the window is closing fast.

The SPD is likely to continue preparations and rhetorical escalation, but unless there is a sudden legal breakthrough or a major political crisis (e.g., evidence of violent plans, or a major AfD scandal), the most probable outcome is that no application is officially filed before 2026.

The legal environment is clouded by the suspended BfV classification (which is being challenged in court). Public opinion is clearly against a ban, especially in the east, and authorities are likely wary of triggering a counter-mobilization or strengthening the AfD\u2019s narrative of persecution. However, the institutional machinery is moving (evidence gathering, legal review), and there is real urgency among anti-AfD actors. If a triggering event (e.g., a major scandal, violence linked to the party, or a legal breakthrough in the BfV case) occurs in the next two months, the risk of a formal application increases.
