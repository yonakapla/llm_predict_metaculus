Internal opposition from key government figures, strong public opposition, and the still-unresolved status of the BfV extremism classification all act as brakes. The history of Verfassungsrecht litigation in Germany shows a conservative, incremental approach, with a high bar for action and a bias toward institutional stability. While the probability of action is higher than in previous years and the SPD's preparations are non-trivial, the time remaining (less than 3 months), procedural requirements, and lack of institutional consensus make a filing before 2026 unlikely, though not impossible.",

However, the legal process is complex, and there is significant resistance both within the government (notably from the CDU/CSU) and among the public. The precedent of the failed NPD ban, which took years and ultimately failed, weighs on decision-makers. The suspension of the BfV\u2019s classification pending court review is a substantial legal obstacle; most lawyers would advise waiting for a definitive administrative ruling to strengthen the application. The time constraint is very real: while preparations are advanced, the formal step of filing is a major one that requires broad political buy-in and legal confidence. Nevertheless, the SPD\u2019s public statements and the establishment of a working group suggest a higher-than-normal risk of a 'Yes' outcome, especially if political calculations shift in the coming weeks. Given these factors, the base rate for party ban filings in German history is extremely low, but the current situation is exceptional. My estimate, balancing all factors, is that there is a moderate chance\u2014higher than the historical base rate but constrained by legal and political realities.",

Public opinion is strongly against a ban, especially in eastern Germany, raising the risk of backlash and legal defeat, as in the NPD case.
