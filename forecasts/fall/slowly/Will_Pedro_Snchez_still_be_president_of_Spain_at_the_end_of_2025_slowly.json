With about 3.5 months until question resolution, significant shifts (like a successful motion of censure) would require rapid and unprecedented agreements among usually fractious opposition/regional parties. Unless a scandal directly and overwhelmingly implicates S\u00e1nchez or new, dramatic developments emerge, the structure of Spanish party politics makes his removal by December 31, 2025, very unlikely.

The legislative timetable and focus on upcoming regional elections further reduce the short-term risk of S\u00e1nchez's ouster before year-end. Major new scandals could still detonate, but absent a game-changing revelation or united coalition revolt, the structural features of Spanish politics strongly favor status quo through to 2025 year-end.

Much of the crisis is institutionalized\u2014budget blockages, public opinion problems\u2014but none have yet reached an undeniable constitutional breaking point. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s own repeated challenges to the opposition to present a motion suggest calculated confidence in their inability to muster an absolute majority. Given Spain\u2019s constitutional and procedural hurdles, the lack of imminent criminal threat to S\u00e1nchez personally, the ongoing discipline in the PSOE (despite pressure), and the absence of credible signals from coalition partners for an alternative majority, I see considerable inertia supporting his continuation, barring a sudden, new and explosive event.

The opposition successfully introduces a motion of censure, coordinating behind a consensus PM candidate. Enough left or regionalist deputies abstain or support the motion to surpass the 176 vote threshold. Alternatively, S\u00e1nchez falls ill or resigns unexpectedly.

The scandals have so far damaged mainly secondary figures, and S\u00e1nchez has responded with familiar European crisis management tools (audits, parliamentary commissions, reshuffles). While parliamentary partners voice discontent, their incentives point toward renegotiation over withdrawal. Only a major, new revelation that personally implicates S\u00e1nchez or a profound realignment among the opposition and regionalists could change the outcome. The base rate of successful mid-term removals is extremely low, even amid scandal. Absent acute new developments, the status quo is durable.",

The current scandal dents legitimacy but has not fatally undermined elite loyalty or created a governing alternative. The fragmented parliament and the lack of opposition unity further decrease the likelihood of successful removal before year-end. While corruption erodes public trust and coalition patience, so far neither party leadership nor key partners have publicly initiated steps that would reliably force S\u00e1nchez out. New, unforeseen escalations could tilt the situation, but with 3.5 months left, the base rate for such late-stage ousters is low.

The corruption scandals are significant and have increased the risk compared to a year ago, but the latest news indicates S\u00e1nchez is successfully buying time, party discipline is holding, and key partners (Sumar, PNV, ERC) continue to negotiate rather than threatening government stability outright. Furthermore, S\u00e1nchez is rhetorically and tactically positioning himself as a victim of partisan attacks, rallying his parliamentary group and coalition. The parliamentary numbers make the opposition's threats mostly bluster unless something new emerges. Base rate logic, party elite cohesion, and the structural inertia all favor S\u00e1nchez remaining PM through 2025, though the margin has narrowed modestly compared to pre-scandal norms.
