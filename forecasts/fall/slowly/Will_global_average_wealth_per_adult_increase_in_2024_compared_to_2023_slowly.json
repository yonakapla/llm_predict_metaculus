Further, base rate reasoning supports an expectation of a year-on-year increase, barring an exceptional crisis\u2014and none occurred in 2024 on the scale required to reverse the global trend.

While regional wealth declines occurred in some markets (e.g., Turkey, some parts of APAC), these were more than outweighed by gains in the largest markets where most global wealth is concentrated. Exchange rates and inflation eroded wealth in some places, but not enough to offset overall global gains. Base rates (3.4% compound annual growth in global wealth per adult) plus direct evidence from respected financial sources (UBS, news aggregations) all indicate a positive shift. Given the robustness of the trend, the absence of a 2022-like negative shock, and the positive skew from high-performing economies, a 'Yes' resolution is highly probable, though not a full certainty as measurement lags or methodological changes at WID could create upside surprises.

Alternatively, aggregate global wealth could stagnate, and a notable increase in the global adult population (e.g., through demographic bulges in low-asset-holding countries) could lower the per-adult average.

Mean wealth remains highly sensitive to large gains at the top end, and by all accounts, the ultra-wealthy and the asset-rich saw further appreciation, with increases in the number of millionaires and robust property/financial asset valuations. While inflation hit real incomes in some regions, and wealth in certain countries (e.g., China, Russia, Turkey) dipped, their effect is far outweighed by the total wealth gains in North America and other developed markets. The strong base rate (wealth per adult almost always rises outside major global crises), corroborated by direct data from UBS and WID-related sources, makes a decline extremely unlikely absent major late-breaking data to the contrary. The only caution comes from the half of surveyed markets seeing declines in adult wealth (often due to local currency depreciation or inflation), but these are generally smaller in global weight.
