Inventory is up, days on market are rising, and price growth is lagging inflation in most national indices. The ZHVI itself has shown near-zero real growth over the past year. Historically, after such a period of stagnation, real price growth does not typically accelerate unless a major demand shock occurs, for which there is currently no strong evidence. Regional heterogeneity matters, but national price indices are weighted toward larger, more volatile markets that are currently softening. The base rate for acceleration in real price growth following a flat year is low. Builder incentives may provide a minor boost, but do not offset the larger macro headwinds.

            "no_scenario": "Real housing prices grow less in 2025 than in 2024, or potentially decline. Inventory continues to build, especially in the South and West, while affordability stays poor and mortgage rates remain elevated. New supply from builders meets a buyer pool weakened by credit constraints and economic uncertainty. The market experiences more price cuts, longer listing times, and a shift from seller to buyer power. Inflation stays in the 2-3% range, outpacing modest nominal home price increases. Regional declines offset gains in a minority of metros. The ZHVI annualized real growth rate from Nov 2024 to Nov 2025 is less than that from Nov 2023 to Nov 2024.",
            "yes_scenario": "Real housing prices in 2025 outpace 2024's real growth. Mortgage rates fall more sharply than expected, stimulating demand, while labor markets and consumer confidence remain strong. Builders' incentives and discounts ignite a mini-buying boom, especially in new homes, which lifts the aggregate ZHVI. Inflation moderates, so even a modest nominal increase in home prices translates to a higher real gain. Regional stragglers stabilize, and high-growth metros accelerate enough to lift the national average.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for consecutive years of accelerating real housing price growth is low, especially after a historic run-up and in an environment of rising inventory and stubbornly high mortgage rates. The bulk of news coverage and data indicates price growth has slowed or stalled in 2025, with several major metros experiencing year-over-year declines and the national average flat or lagging inflation. While the new-home segment shows a pulse thanks to incentives and lower rates, this is likely insufficient to offset broader weakness, especially as existing-home sales remain at decade lows and affordability metrics continue to worsen. From a stratification perspective, the market's ability to absorb further price increases is curtailed by the shrinking pool of qualified buyers, as housing costs now tangibly shape family and life choices. The only plausible Yes scenario would require a sharper drop in rates and a demand surge that is not yet evident in the data. Given these dynamics, the probability that real housing prices will increase more in 2025 than in 2024 is below the base rate for 'trend reversal' years and is consistent with the early stages of a market correction.",
