Moreover, explicit reporting notes that Sushila Karki has already been installed as interim prime minister with broad institutional backing, and all external pressures (regional and global powers) reinforce the status quo.

            "no_scenario": "Sushila Karki continues as caretaker PM throughout the resolution window, possibly until elections in March 2026. Even if a transition to a full-time Prime Minister occurred, major parties and institutional actors would unite to prevent Lamichhane, due to his legal troubles, divisiveness, and lack of consensus support. Even if he is freed, procedural hurdles and requirements for a parliamentary confidence vote make his rapid elevation almost impossible.",
            "yes_scenario": "A dramatic popular intervention or unexpected legal turnaround leads to Lamichhane\u2019s release, rehabilitation, and overwhelming support from the Gen Z movement and parliamentary defectors. He then constructs a cross-factional coalition, is appointed PM, is sworn in, and wins the confidence vote before January 1, 2026. This would require the collapse of all legal cases, a full endorsement from both youth and institutional actors (army/president), rapid formation of a new majority, and the absence of any veto by international or elite actors. This scenario is highly implausible given current facts.",
            "final_reasoning": "Although Rabi Lamichhane was a plausible populist contender before the latest round of turmoil, his current legal status (detained or recently released but still facing criminal charges) drastically lowers his viability. Nepal\u2019s constitution and elite actors strongly favor figures who are untainted by ongoing legal proceedings for such a sensitive role\u2014especially as the country recovers from extreme unrest. There is no indication that Lamichhane has mobilized majority elite support, nor does he have a plausible path to a swift, legitimate, and internationally accepted installation as a non-caretaker PM before January 2026. The most likely scenario is that Sushila Karki remains caretaker PM up to the scheduled elections. If a full, non-caretaker PM emerges unexpectedly, it will almost certainly be a candidate without serious legal baggage and with broad consensus support. Base rates in Nepal and global cases indicate that, in the wake of crisis, returns to the status quo (caretaker government continuity) or elevation of compromise figures are the norm\u2014not the installation of legally embattled populists. I therefore assign the probability of Rabi Lamichhane becoming the next non-caretaker prime minister of Nepal before January 1, 2026 as vanishingly small.",

Rabi Lamichhane, while a popular figure with the youth and anti-corruption movements, is currently noted to be incarcerated or just released amid unresolved legal controversies. There is no majority party currently, and the traditional parties (Nepali Congress, UML, Maoist Centre) are weakened but not dissolved.",

Lamichhane is behind bars or just recently released (per conflicting reports), facing unresolved legal issues including embezzlement/fraud, which would hamper eligibility for PM, at least in the near term.

Elections are held as scheduled (or after a brief delay), and either an establishment-backed consensus candidate, a technocratic figure, or a new outsider (but not Lamichhane) ascends as non-caretaker PM. Lamichhane's legal cloud, lack of party machine, and Gen Z fragmentation prevent his coalition-building/majority.",
            "yes_scenario": "The only plausible yes scenario would require: (a) rapid and complete legal vindication/rehabilitation for Lamichhane, (b) sudden, total unification of Gen Z and anti-corruption movements behind him, (c) traditional parties collapsing or ceding power to street movements, and (d) Lamichhane not only contesting but winning a majority coalition and confidence vote between Sep 11, 2025\u2013Jan 1, 2026\u2014a combination that has not been signaled in current reporting and is historically unprecedented.",
            "final_reasoning": "Synthesizing the above, Lamichhane's prospects are severely undermined by ongoing, unresolved legal cases and questions over eligibility; ambiguous status (incarcerated or only recently released); lack of unified support from either the Gen Z movement or major parties; and international and elite apprehensions about instability and outsider leadership. Meanwhile, caretaker Sushila Karki enjoys broad (though possibly temporary) support and is recognized by army and external actors. Base rates of outsider, legally embattled figures rapidly ascending to Prime Ministership are extremely low in the region. Only a dramatic shift in the next 3.5 months could alter this calculus, for which there is currently no evidence. Accordingly, factoring both base rate and current situation, the probability that Rabi Lamichhane will be the next non-caretaker Prime Minister of Nepal in this time frame is very low.",
