PLA capability improvements are ongoing, but former readiness deadlines were set for 2027, and no open-source intelligence currently signals extraordinary build-up or 'go' orders for this year. Xi and the PLA are risk-tolerant on gray-zone expansion but remain risk-averse regarding multi-theater war with the US and coalition, especially absent a clear, immediate provocation or regime crisis.
