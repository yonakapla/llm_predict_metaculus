Track Two and backchannel efforts are ongoing but have not produced a breakthrough. The strictness of the resolution criteria (all territory, 30 days, no breakdowns) further lowers the odds.

The historical base rate for such ceasefires in similar contexts is low. While the possibility of a last-minute deal cannot be entirely ruled out, the window is now extremely narrow and there is no sign of a rapid shift in incentives or battlefield realities.

Both sides' negotiating positions remain irreconcilable: Russia insists on recognition of territorial gains and Ukrainian neutrality, while Ukraine refuses to cede territory or abandon NATO aspirations. Ongoing fighting and the lack of a mutually acceptable framework (or even a scheduled trilateral summit) further reduce the likelihood. While Trump\u2019s involvement has increased diplomatic activity, there is little evidence of substantive convergence. Historically, such entrenched conflicts rarely see a durable, comprehensive ceasefire without a dramatic change in the military or political balance.

The fundamental security dilemma remains: Russia insists on territorial and security concessions that are politically unpalatable for any Ukrainian leadership, while Ukraine cannot accept a ceasefire that legitimizes occupation. Trump's mediation injects some (but limited) probability of a breakthrough, especially as both sides may be war-weary and external actors are eager for deescalation.
