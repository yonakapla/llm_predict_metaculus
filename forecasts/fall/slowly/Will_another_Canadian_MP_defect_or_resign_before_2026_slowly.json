The short time window tempers the likelihood, but the current climate\u2014marked by a leadership review, ideological rifts, and active government courting\u2014pushes risk above normal. The probability is further elevated by the fact that just one more resignation or defection is needed to resolve Yes, and there are already MPs (such as Shannon Stubbs, currently on medical leave, and other moderates) whose situations bear watching. However, the strong tradition of party discipline, the high personal cost of such moves, and the historical rarity of multiple defections in such a short period keep the probability well below certainty.

The context is highly unstable: the Liberal government is actively seeking defectors, the Conservative Party is divided and faces a leadership review, and abstentions/absences have become a tactical tool. However, the immediate aftermath of public drama often triggers a period of retrenchment and discipline, especially with the holiday recess looming. Parliament's reduced activity and the high reputational and career risks of moving now (versus waiting for the leadership review) decrease the likelihood. Still, historic clustering around instability, ongoing rumors, and the clear incentives for both government and ambitious MPs to act prevent the probability from being too low. I assess that the risk is notably higher than the typical background rate, but still below 50%, as the incentives to wait until the leadership review or after the holidays are strong. The most likely scenario is status quo, but a Yes outcome is plausible if another MP is particularly aggrieved or if the Liberals sweeten their inducements.",

The holiday recess and upcoming Conservative leadership review provide a cooling-off period, and would-be defectors are deterred by recent backlash or decide to await the outcome of Poilievre\u2019s leadership review before acting. The Liberals fail to entice further defections, and no MP resigns or changes party status.",

This could be triggered by further party discipline actions, failed reconciliation in caucus, or attractive offers from the Liberal government. Alternatively, a scandal, health issue, or local constituency issue could precipitate a resignation.",
            "final_reasoning": "The current environment is unusually volatile for Canadian federal politics: a razor-thin minority government, visible cracks in opposition party unity, a recent cluster of defections/resignations, and a government with much to gain from enticing just one or two more MPs. Party System Theory suggests that minority governments, especially near-majority ones, see heightened elite bargaining and incentives for 'deal-making' with fence-sitters or dissatisfied MPs. While the parliamentary calendar and the high cost of defection (social and reputational) act as brakes, the cluster of recent moves and explicit government efforts to recruit further floor-crossers tilt the balance toward 'Yes.' The short timeframe and holiday break are real dampeners, but the proximity of a possible majority and the incentives for both sides create a window of heightened risk. Historical base rates for such moves are low, but the cluster effect and current instability make this period an outlier. I estimate the chance of at least one further resignation or defection before January 1, 2026, at 65%.",

However, the incentives for both the Liberals (to gain a majority) and wavering opposition MPs (to secure relevance or align with their constituents) remain strong, and the leadership review in January creates a window for hedging before potential party realignment. The short time window and high party discipline do lower the odds, as does the historical base rate, but the situation is more fluid than in a typical session.
