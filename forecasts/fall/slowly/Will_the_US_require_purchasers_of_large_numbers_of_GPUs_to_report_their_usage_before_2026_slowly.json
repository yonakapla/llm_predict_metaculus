The Trump administration is actively relaxing export controls and prioritizing economic considerations. While there is bipartisan concern and some recent regulatory activity, the Commerce rule of Jan 2025 only introduces notification for lower-volume chip orders and is focused on exports, not post-sale usage. All news points to repeated Congressional failures to close loopholes, and no evidence of a new reporting regime being implemented before the question\u2019s deadline. The base rate for the US moving from export licensing to mandatory end-user usage reporting on advanced technology is very low on a sub-one-year time frame.

The January 2025 export control update included only notification for small orders and did not require usage-level reporting.

The bulk of U.S. policy attention and regulatory activity remains on limiting exports and foreign access, not on domestic tracking or reporting for American buyers. Domestic reporting would be a qualitatively new regulatory move, not a mere extension of current export controls."

Export controls remain focused on sales to adversaries, but no new domestic monitoring infrastructure is implemented. Responsible innovation debates continue, but policy does not shift before the deadline.",
            "yes_scenario": "A sudden security incident or credible intelligence report triggers an emergency regulatory response, or the Trump administration/Commerce Department issues an executive order or interim rule requiring purchasers of large volumes of GPUs to report usage to a federal authority before year-end 2025. Alternatively, Congress passes last-minute legislation as part of a broader national security package, overcoming industry resistance.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for the U.S. enacting complex new reporting requirements on technology purchases within a few months is extremely low, especially given the evidence of repeated failures in Congress, successful industry resistance, and the established focus on export rather than domestic controls. While national security rhetoric and calls for tracking are strong, there is no concrete sign of imminent regulatory change. Responsible innovation frameworks would advocate for such monitoring, but political and economic inertia dominate the real-world outcome. The status quo overwhelmingly favors 'No'. The only plausible 'Yes' scenario would require an extraordinary, last-minute policy shift for which there is no evidence in current news. Therefore, I assess the probability as extremely low.",
