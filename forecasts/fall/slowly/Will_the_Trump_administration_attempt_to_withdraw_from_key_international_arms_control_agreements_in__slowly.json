The international context (Ukraine war, Russia\u2019s own treaty suspensions) and Trump\u2019s preference for dealmaking could provide a rationale for withdrawal, but so far, the administration is pursuing at least rhetorical extension. Domestic and allied opposition would be fierce for any major withdrawal, particularly from the NPT or CWC. The time remaining is short, and the status quo is sticky. Given the fine print requiring more than rhetoric or exploratory reviews, and the absence of concrete steps as of now, the base rate for mid-term arms control withdrawals is low. Balancing Trump\u2019s historical pattern (raising the risk modestly) against clear evidence of current intentions and constraints (pointing toward no formal attempt), I assign a probability moderately above the historic mean but well below 50%.",

While Trump's first term saw several high-profile withdrawals, those were telegraphed well in advance and in each case, the administration built a public case for months before acting. The treaties in question, with the exception of New START, have strong bipartisan support and are foundational to US security policy. The base rate of US withdrawal from major arms control treaties on short notice is extremely low.
