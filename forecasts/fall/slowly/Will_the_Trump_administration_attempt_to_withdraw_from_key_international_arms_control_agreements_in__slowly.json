The base rate for US withdrawal from major arms control treaties is low and generally preceded by months of signaling and process, none of which is present here. Domestic and international incentives (including military and bipartisan Congressional support) strongly discourage rapid or unilateral withdrawal from the remaining treaties, especially the CWC, NPT, BWC, CCW, and OST, which are foundational to global security architecture. While Trump\u2019s first-term record increases the tail risk of sudden moves, the absence of any concrete steps or hostile rhetoric as of October 2025 makes a formal withdrawal attempt before January 1, 2026, highly unlikely. The most plausible scenario remains that the US either extends or lets New START expire naturally, with no formal withdrawal attempt.
