On the contrary, Trump is publicly receptive to extending New START for a year, which is the opposite of a withdrawal attempt. The fine print explicitly excludes rhetorical threats or exploratory reviews, sharply narrowing the range of qualifying actions. Political, bureaucratic, and international costs for exiting NPT, CWC, or BWC are exceptionally high, making such moves exceedingly unlikely absent a major, unforeseeable crisis. With only about 2.5 months left, the window for a formal, qualifying withdrawal attempt is very narrow, and no such process appears underway.

The legal, diplomatic, and political obstacles to withdrawing from the NPT, CWC, BWC, CCW, or OST are immense, and there is no sign of intent to breach those. The CTBT is not ratified and would only trigger a Yes if the US announced a formal non-compliance policy, which there is no evidence for at present. The most plausible candidate for a withdrawal attempt is New START, but both US and Russian leaders are currently engaged in extension talks, not withdrawal.
