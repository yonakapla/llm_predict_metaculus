Base rates for such rapid, contested changes in Brazilian labor law are very low. While extraordinary mobilization could theoretically tip the scales (as with the recent defeat of the 'PEC da Blindagem'), there is no indication that the 6x1 issue is generating sufficient public urgency or political consensus to overcome entrenched resistance in the time remaining. The more likely scenario is that the debate continues into 2026, possibly influencing the electoral agenda, but without a formal legislative ban on the 6x1 schedule for most CLT workers before January 1, 2026.",
