The legal system moves slowly, and an ICC warrant, while unprecedented, has not materially changed domestic political calculations. Public opinion is hostile, but not sufficient on its own to force him out. Given the time remaining, inertia and Netanyahu\u2019s staying power, I estimate the probability at 75%.

The only credible threats to his tenure before year-end are a sudden, coordinated coalition revolt or a health/personal crisis\u2014both unlikely and with no current evidence of imminent occurrence. The legal process is glacial, and even a conviction would require appeals to be exhausted before removal, which cannot be completed in less than three months. International warrants, while embarrassing and limiting diplomatically, have no domestic legal standing. Rumors of elections by October 2025 have not materialized, and the time window for organizing and holding elections before 2026 is rapidly closing. Netanyahu's coalition partners continue to support him, fearing both electoral backlash and instability. In sum, while there are substantial headwinds, the structural and procedural barriers to his ouster are formidable, and the status quo is sticky.

Legal proceedings are slow, and Israeli law makes forced removal very unlikely barring final conviction. The ICC warrant is a reputational/operational constraint, not an immediate domestic threat. The main wildcard is a snap election: if one is held and a new PM is installed before year-end, the question resolves NO. However, as of mid-October, no such election is scheduled, and time is running short to organize and complete a transition before December 31.
