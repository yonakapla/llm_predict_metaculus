These changes were statutory (not just administrative or via appropriations riders), and the law was passed and signed well before Jan 1, 2026. There is overwhelming evidence, including from official congressional and advocacy group summaries, that the law meets the question\u2019s resolution criteria: it amends the climate provisions of the IRA by restricting eligibility and reducing funds for climate programs.

Furthermore, the fine print excludes appropriations riders and administrative actions from resolving 'Yes'\u2014and the appetite for additional legislative cuts is likely exhausted for the remainder of the year, particularly with Congress entering a pre-election posture.
