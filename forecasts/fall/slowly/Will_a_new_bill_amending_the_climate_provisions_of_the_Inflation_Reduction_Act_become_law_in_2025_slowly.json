There are no credible reports of new climate-related amendments in the congressional pipeline for the remainder of the year.

The legislative agenda is likely to move on, and with Republicans having achieved their objectives, there is little incentive for a rapid follow-on bill. While legal and political contestation continues, the window for further major statutory changes is now closed unless a new, unpredictable focusing event occurs. The historical base rate for multiple major amendments to landmark climate legislation within a single year is extremely low. Therefore, the probability that another bill amending the IRA's climate provisions becomes law before the end of 2025 is very low\u2014though not exactly zero, given the possibility of unforeseen events or technical legislative errors.",

This window was rapidly exploited by passage of the OBBBA, which, according to all credible news and expert sources, explicitly amends and repeals major climate provisions of the IRA. The fine print for resolution is satisfied unless it is found that the changes were not statutory or did not affect climate provisions. The only plausible reason for a NO would be a technicality about how the OBBBA was enacted or interpreted, but the weight of evidence strongly favors YES. Base rates for such rapid and sweeping amendments to major legislation are low, but this case falls into the main outlier scenario: unified government and an explicit campaign mandate for repeal.
