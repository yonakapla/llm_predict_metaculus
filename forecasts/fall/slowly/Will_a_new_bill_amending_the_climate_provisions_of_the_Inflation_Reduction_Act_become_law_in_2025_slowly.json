The sharp policy reversal and intense partisan conflict over the IRA\u2019s climate provisions makes coalition dynamics central to predicting further amendments.

This could be driven by newly discovered spending or implementation loopholes, a large economic/energy shock prompting Congress to further restrict or reallocate funding, or a budget reconciliation process revealing additional opportunities to cut or limit climate programs. Unified GOP control and pressure from fossil fuel interests could yield additional targeted rollbacks, especially around issues like hydrogen credits, tribal energy programs, or remaining EV/battery incentives.",

This act repealed most clean energy tax credits, cut climate spending, and eliminated major incentive programs. The Advocacy Coalition Framework suggests major policy change happens in bursts (punctuated equilibrium), and the passage of OBBBA represents such a burst. After such a large, controversial change, further amendments within the same year are historically rare due to legislative fatigue, institutional constraints, and mobilized opposition from the pro-climate coalition (environmental groups, some industry, tribal governments, and Democratic lawmakers). While unified GOP control and pressure from fossil fuel interests could theoretically yield additional amendments, the base rate for rapid, repeated statutory changes to the same provisions is very low. The remaining disputes are more likely to play out via rulemaking, appropriations, or the courts\u2014not new bills. Thus, the probability of another new bill amending the (already largely repealed) IRA climate provisions becoming law in 2025 is quite low.",
