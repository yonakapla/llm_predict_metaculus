Labour participation remains high, and any rise in unemployment is absorbed through flexible work arrangements and policy interventions. Even with global headwinds, the unemployment rate does not surpass 4.5% in any month of 2025.",
            "yes_scenario": "A sharp external shock\u2014such as a renewed eurozone banking crisis, abrupt energy supply disruption, or a significant drop in global demand\u2014hits the Netherlands in late 2025. Mass layoffs in exposed sectors push the unemployment rate up rapidly, and it exceeds 5% in at least one month before policy responses can take effect.",
            "final_reasoning": "The Dutch unemployment rate has been remarkably stable, hovering just below 4% throughout 2025, and only exceeded 5% in very severe, rare downturns (e.g., 2009, 2013, 2020). While there are signs of a softening global labour market and moderate economic headwinds, there is no evidence of an imminent shock of similar magnitude. The Dutch labour market is structurally robust, with high participation, flexible work arrangements, and effective social policies that act as shock absorbers. Sectoral risks from AI and automation are real but not sufficient to drive the aggregate rate above 5% absent a major crisis. Demographic trends (ageing, stable migration) further support labour market tightness. The only plausible path to >5% unemployment is a severe, unexpected external shock, which is not currently in the base case. Considering the status quo, base rates, and the latest news, the probability that Dutch unemployment will rise above 5% in any month of 2025 is low but nonzero to account for tail risks.",
