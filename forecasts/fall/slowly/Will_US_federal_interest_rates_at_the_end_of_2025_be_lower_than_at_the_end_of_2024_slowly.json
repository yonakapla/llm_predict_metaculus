Structural public choice incentives (Fed\u2019s preference for credibility, gradualism, and avoiding policy reversals) support the consensus scenario of two more cuts, as does the political economy context (election year, labor market weakness, administrative pressure). However, I moderate against extremity due to persistent inflation above target, FOMC member wariness, and the risk of a data gap due to the government shutdown. The main risk to a 'Yes' outcome is a resurgence of inflation or a geopolitical shock (energy prices, tariffs) that puts the FOMC on pause. With current futures pricing and forward guidance, and in light of both institutional inertia and the public choice incentives, the probability that the rate on December 31, 2025 is below the December 2024 level is high, but not certain.",
