Inflation is still above target but shows no sign of re-accelerating; the risk is more of a stall than a renewed upward spiral. The government shutdown and data delays add uncertainty but are unlikely to fully halt the expected cuts unless inflation worsens. Internal FOMC division may slow, but not stop, gradual cuts. Base rates show that, once begun, easing cycles rarely stop after just one cut unless there is a negative inflation surprise. Markets are pricing in more than the minimum required, and the FOMC\u2019s own SEP is consistent with a year-end EFFR well below 4.33%. Therefore, the probability of the EFFR being below 4.33% on December 31, 2025, is high, though not absolute, as inflation or political dysfunction could still throw a wrench in the process.",

Labor market indicators (ADP, JOLTS, Challenger, rising unemployment) are deteriorating, providing a dovish impetus. While inflation remains above target, the committee's recent actions and statements suggest that labor risks are now at least as salient as inflation risks. The government shutdown introduces uncertainty but is more likely to slow the economy than reignite inflation, and the FOMC is likely to err on the side of support. The main risk to further cuts is a sudden inflation spike or a surprising rebound in jobs data, but current momentum and consensus make such a reversal unlikely in the near term. Internal FOMC caution may slow the pace but is unlikely to prevent at least one more cut. Thus, the probability that the Effective Federal Funds Rate at the end of 2025 is below 4.33% is high, though not virtually certain due to inflation and FOMC caution risks.",

The main risk to further cuts is a resurgence of inflation\u2014yet, despite inflation being above target, the data show a clear labor market slowdown, and most FOMC members are signaling a bias toward gradual easing. The bureaucratic incentive is to avoid a sharp policy reversal: a slow, data-dependent easing path minimizes both inflation and unemployment blame.

Given the high base rate of continued easing once a cycle has begun, and the strong forward guidance, the probability that the Effective FFR will be below 4.33% at year-end is high, though not a lock\u2014there remains risk from inflation.
