However, the weight of labor data, the resumption of cuts, and the desire to avoid policy inertia in the face of economic slowdown tilt the odds toward the effective rate ending 2025 below 4.33%. The main risk to this forecast is an unexpectedly strong rebound in labor data or a significant inflation shock, both of which currently lack strong evidence.

Dissent within the FOMC hardens, leading to a pause after the October cut, or even a reversal if inflation becomes acute. The Fed, seeking to protect its anti-inflation credibility and with the 2024\u201325 experience of high inflation fresh in mind, decides not to cut again, leaving the Effective Federal Funds Rate close to or above the current level (possibly marginally above 4.33% if there is a technical rebound).

While inflation and internal FOMC division are real risks, the balance of evidence\u2014especially persistent labor market weakness and the Fed's aversion to surprising markets\u2014suggests the effective rate will remain below 4.33% at year-end. Base rates (historically, once the Fed begins a cut cycle, it is rare to reverse course before reaching a lower plateau) also support this. Public Choice Theory implies that the Fed, facing both political and market pressure in an election cycle, is more likely to err on the side of gradual easing than tightening, especially with real economy indicators weakening. The main tail risk is a sharp inflationary spike or political/institutional crisis that forces a policy reversal, but current data and incentive structures make this unlikely in the next 2.5 months.",

Alternatively, the government shutdown or international shocks (oil prices, tariffs) reignite inflation concerns, and the Fed halts or even reverses cuts. This scenario is less likely given current projections, but plausible if inflation surprises to the upside or the labor market stabilizes unexpectedly.",

The FOMC\u2019s recent actions, official statements, and projections all support the expectation of at least one, and likely two, additional cuts by year-end. Labor market signals are clearly weakening, and while inflation remains above target, the Fed appears willing to risk slightly elevated inflation to avoid a sharper employment downturn. Political business cycle theory supports further easing in the wake of an election and amid economic softness. The main risks to a 'No' outcome are a sudden inflation re-acceleration or a data-driven pause due to missing or unexpectedly strong data, but these are not the base case. Given the weight of evidence, the probability that the Effective Federal Funds Rate will be lower than 4.33% on December 31, 2025, is very high.",
