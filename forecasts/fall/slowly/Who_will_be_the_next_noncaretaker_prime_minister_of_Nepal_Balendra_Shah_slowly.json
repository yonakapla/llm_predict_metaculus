While intra-youth movement splits exist and instability is high, the system has rapidly coalesced around a caretaker/technocratic pathway with Karki at the helm. The historical base rate for mayors being elevated to sudden national executive leadership, especially after declining an interim post, is very low; such a scenario would depend on a second collapse, mass movement disavowal of Karki (not yet evident), and institutional desperation.

However, the available reporting as of mid-September 2025 is clear: after serious unrest, Shah declined the role of interim PM, publicly endorsed Sushila Karki for the caretaker regime, and remains mayor of Kathmandu. The structure of Nepal\u2019s response\u2014a technocratic, non-partisan caretaker cabinet with an explicit six-month mandate to conduct fresh elections\u2014means Karki and her team are not normal officeholders, but are transitional figures. Since the parliamentary pathway to prime ministership is also frozen (no sitting House, no political party or coalition base for Balen nationally), the base rate for a city mayor to become PM in this exceptional, constitutional crisis interval is extremely low. The most probable scenario is that the next non-caretaker PM is chosen after the March 2026 election, likely through conventional party and coalition bargaining. For a Yes, the Karki cabinet would have to collapse almost immediately, and a (perhaps illegal) move would be made to appoint Balen as actual (not caretaker) PM\u2014a move that faces significant opposition within both the elite and the Gen Z coalition, as seen by divisions in the youth movement. Even if the caretaker government does not last the full term, the lineup of likely substitutes (senior technocrats, other figures with national legitimacy, or improbable return to military oversight) does not support Balen\u2019s elevation. Thus, while Balen remains a plausible national leader in the near-future, especially after elections, his chances of becoming the next non-caretaker PM before January 1, 2026 are exceedingly slim.",

The core legal barrier is that the current arrangement and schedule only allow for an interim caretaker government (per the protestor/Gen-Z and palace/army consensus, and supported by the President), with new elections due in March 2026. Moreover, Shah has so far declined the role when already being the lead youth/outsider figure, and even among protesters, divisions and procedural uncertainty persist. All credible news indicates the mainstream and Gen-Z groups have backed Karki as a compromise, with little evidence of any change in that consensus since her swearing in; he continues to serve as mayor, not as a galvanizing candidate for PM. Given historical base rates of extra-constitutional or outsider appointments between elections and the constitutional need for legitimacy (an oath, vote of confidence) in the context of a dissolved parliament, the probability that Balendra Shah will become the next non-caretaker PM before elections is so low as to approach zero, barring a complete collapse of the current caretaker government AND the appearance of a new, constitutional House for a vote.

Shah declined interim PM, lacks an established national party, and has minimal evidence of coalition-building with military, judiciary, or international actors.

Base rates in South Asian crisis transitions suggest outsiders rarely win the premiership absent a total systemic collapse.
