Historically, even the worst flare-ups have not resulted in more than 40 deaths per episode, and there is no credible evidence that current hostilities have killed more than 50-60 people total since May. To reach 500 deaths would require either a dramatic breakdown in talks and a level of violence not seen in decades, or a hidden mass-casualty event that has not been reported by any credible sources. Given the incentives for both sides to avoid an all-out war, the demonstrated tendency toward proportional response, and the base rates from past conflicts, the probability of 500 deaths occurring by December 31, 2025, is very low. While the risk is not zero\u2014accidents, rogue actors, or failed negotiations could cause renewed violence\u2014the available evidence and strategic logic make a major escalation unlikely.",

Both sides escalate rapidly, using artillery, airstrikes, and massed troops, causing heavy military and civilian casualties and easily exceeding 500 deaths before diplomatic intervention can reimpose a ceasefire.",

This most recent escalation has seen a significant spike in violence (at least 43 dead in about two months), but since the late July ceasefire, there have been no credible reports of renewed large-scale kinetic operations. Instead, there is evidence of ongoing diplomatic engagement (JBC, GBC meetings), preparations for a peace agreement at the ASEAN Summit, and some progress on mutual troop withdrawals and mine clearance. While the trust deficit, historical grievances, and nationalist pressures provide a non-negligible risk of renewed violence, the momentum is currently toward de-escalation, and both governments appear to be seeking offramps under international scrutiny. Given the tight timeline (just over two months left) and that the current death tolls are well below the threshold, the most likely outcome is that the death toll remains below 500. The main risk is a black swan incident triggering uncontrolled escalation, but this is unlikely barring a deliberate sabotage of the peace process. Accounting for residual risk of breakdown but weighting status quo and diplomatic momentum heavily, I assess the probability at 12%.",

            "no_scenario": "The ceasefire holds, though tense; diplomatic talks continue with fits and starts, and while there are minor border incidents, psychological operations, and perhaps sporadic violence, neither side resumes major offensive operations. Nationalist pressure is managed by each government through domestic rhetoric and cooperation with ASEAN. The Kuala Lumpur Declaration is signed, and troop withdrawals and prisoner releases proceed slowly. Total military deaths from May 28 to December 31 remain under 100.",
            "yes_scenario": "The ceasefire collapses due to an unexpected major incident (e.g., a high-profile assassination, mass civilian casualties from a stray shell, or a failed negotiation triggering nationalist outrage in one capital). Either side launches renewed major military operations\u2014artillery barrages, cross-border raids, or airstrikes\u2014leading to sustained fighting over several weeks. Both militaries escalate, possibly drawing in irregulars or local militia, resulting in cumulative deaths surpassing 500 before international actors can broker another truce.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for inter-state conflict in Southeast Asia resulting in 500+ deaths in a half-year period is exceedingly low, particularly between Thailand and Cambodia, whose last major conflicts (2008-2011) resulted in dozens of deaths over years, not hundreds in months. The most recent flare-up (late July 2025) was the deadliest in over a decade, with about 43-45 deaths. Since the July ceasefire, there have been no reports of major renewed fighting, and both sides are actively engaged in diplomatic processes, with ASEAN, Malaysia, the US, and China applying pressure for peace. The current climate is tense, with incidents (e.g., psychological warfare, minor skirmishes), but the militaries are holding back from open combat. The political context (nationalism, unresolved grievances) and the fragility of the ceasefire mean that a sudden escalation cannot be completely ruled out. However, the cumulative evidence (historical patterns, current political/diplomatic developments, external mediation, and the lack of ongoing large-scale combat) strongly points to a 'No' outcome. While it is plausible to see another brief round of fighting, it would have to be more than 10 times deadlier than any previous episode in the past two decades to cross the 500-death threshold. Given all factors, a highly confident forecast is warranted.",
