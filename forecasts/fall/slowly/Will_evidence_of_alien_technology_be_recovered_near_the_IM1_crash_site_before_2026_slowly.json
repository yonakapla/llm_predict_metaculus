            "final_reasoning": "Applying the philosophy of science perspective, this question sits at the intersection of extraordinary empirical claim and stringent epistemic standards. The base rate for peer-reviewed, multi-lab confirmation of alien technology is effectively zero, and the procedural, sociological, and evidential hurdles are immense. Loeb\u2019s work, while high-profile and suggestive, has not yet met the burden of proof required for such a claim, and the remaining time for analysis, review, and consensus is extremely short. Scientific consensus, especially on paradigm-challenging discoveries, typically moves very slowly, and even compelling preliminary data would likely see years of debate and attempted falsification before acceptance. The current evidence is intriguing but falls far short of the demarcation criteria required for a Yes resolution. Thus, the probability is extremely low but not precisely zero, reflecting both the status quo base rate and the short timeline.",
