While DOJ can sometimes buy weeks or a few months, the facts here are unusually stark: a considered 77-page district court opinion, a fast-tracked appellate calendar, a standstill in federal prosecutions, and explicit resistance from local judges and the bar. The likelihood that these frictions remain unresolved for 3.5 more months is low. Legal history also shows that, once a federal court conclusively rules an appointment unlawful, administrative mechanisms (e.g., the office website) update to conform within weeks. Nonetheless, the level of executive pushback, the possibility of Supreme Court intervention, or drawn-out appeals (especially if court orders are stayed) prevent a slam-dunk zero.

DOJ's past willingness to invent workaround titles (e.g., 'special attorney') may prolong her signature being on some filings, but as judicial and Senate opposition hardens and the courts endorse removal, such efforts typically end in retreat, not permanent defiance. Given that the question's strict resolution depends on the DOJ website, and judicial victories by the administration elsewhere (e.g., resistance to Senate/Judicial checks in New York) have not occurred in the face of uniform district/Judiciary opposition seen here, the probability of Habba still officially holding this title on Dec. 31 is very low.

            "no_scenario": "The appeals court upholds the district judge\u2019s ruling (likely under the plain text of 28 USC \u00a7546 and the Vacancies Reform Act). The Justice Department reluctantly, or under direct supervisory or contempt threat by the judiciary, either removes Habba or at least ceases to list her as U.S. Attorney on the official website. Alternatively, mounting operational chaos, bad press, and threat of institutional crisis compels the administration to appoint a compromise acting U.S. Attorney, or the judiciary takes additional steps to enforce its order, perhaps with administrative assistance (e.g., GSA, OIG, or U.S. Marshals). On December 31, 2025, the official website no longer lists Habba as the U.S. Attorney.",

Alternatively, a prolonged stay pending Supreme Court review or technical procedural delays allow Habba to remain listed on the website as U.S. Attorney through December 31, 2025, regardless of judicial pronouncements. Or, the Trump administration simply defies the judiciary (as in the Andrew Jackson episode), and the website continues to list her absent a physical intervention.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates for U.S. Attorneys remaining in office after adverse court rulings on their appointments are near zero. The legal structure (28 USC \u00a7546, FVRA) and judicial discretion for district courts to install a replacement were designed precisely to prevent indefinite acting appointments. Here, the district judges have aggressively exercised their power, and an expedited appeals schedule suggests this issue will be promptly resolved. The district court\u2019s finding is clear, direct, and highly credentialed\u2014making reversal or indefinite stalling on appeal unlikely. The Trump DOJ\u2019s norm-breaking and willingness for confrontational standoffs increases the probability of a prolonged listing, as does the website-based resolution criterion. However, the judicial system is well-practiced at enforcing clear statutory limits, particularly amid operational gridlock, and public/press scrutiny raises the cost of non-compliance. Given the convergence of statutory and judicial opposition, and assuming the courts enforce their order by December 31, 2025, the most likely outcome is Habba will not be U.S. Attorney for New Jersey by that date. There is an outside chance the Trump administration engineers further procedural delays, simply refuses to remove her, or manipulates the website\u2014especially if litigation stretches to late December. The current momentum, however, favors legal and institutional correction in the next 3.5 months.",
