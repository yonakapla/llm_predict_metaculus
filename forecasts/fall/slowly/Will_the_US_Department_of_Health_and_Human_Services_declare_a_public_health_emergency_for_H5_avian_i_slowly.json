The Multiple Streams Framework suggests the streams have not coupled: the problem stream (no sustained human transmission), the policy stream (tools exist but are not urgently needed), and the politics stream (no major public or political outcry) have not aligned. Unless a dramatic and well-documented shift occurs (mutation to efficient human transmission, mass severe human cases, or major political mobilization), the likelihood of a PHE declaration remains low, albeit not negligible given the theoretical risk of viral evolution.
