The CDC remains institutionally conservative about making such claims without direct, overwhelming evidence. Even with the increased number of mild/asymptomatic cases, spillover into mammals, and the rise in ambiguous exposures, there is no confirmed, CDC-acknowledged instance of human-to-human transmission in the current period. Additionally, the US government shutdown and disruption of CDC operations further reduce the likelihood of rapid, definitive new reporting, as does the longstanding bias toward attributing ambiguous cases to environmental or undetected animal exposures. While the probability is higher than in previous years, it remains more likely than not that no such CDC report will occur before the end of 2025.

Nevertheless, all direct CDC statements and international reports as of late October 2025 continue to assert that no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in recent cases. There is also a significant reporting bottleneck due to the U.S. government shutdown and CDC disruptions, making it less likely that any new finding would be officially declared in the next two months, even if suggestive evidence emerges. The fine print requires a CDC statement about a specific case, not merely plausibility. The base rate for zoonotic influenzas to cross this evidentiary threshold in a short time remains low. While the probability is higher than it would have been a year ago due to the increase in cases and the CDC's shifting tone, the lack of any CDC-confirmed recent event and the reporting bottlenecks mean the probability is still well below even odds.",

However, several recent developments increase the risk: (1) The CDC's own review now openly acknowledges that asymptomatic and likely person-to-person transmission have occurred in past outbreaks, including at least one with no plausible animal exposure. (2) The virus continues to circulate widely among mammals and people in close contact with infected animals, raising adaptation risk. (3) There is heightened public and institutional vigilance, increasing the probability that credible clusters will be investigated and\u2014if evidence is strong\u2014publicly acknowledged. On the other hand, surveillance gaps, especially for mild/asymptomatic cases, and the CDC's historically high bar for reporting human-to-human transmission, act as brakes. Furthermore, the short time window to the end of 2025 reduces chances that an unequivocal, reportable cluster emerges and is officially acknowledged. Overall, while the risk is non-trivial and higher than historic base rates, the balance of evidence and institutional inertia points to a somewhat elevated, but still sub-50%, probability.",
