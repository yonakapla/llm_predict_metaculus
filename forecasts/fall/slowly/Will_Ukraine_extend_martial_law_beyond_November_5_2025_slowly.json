Martial law is a core instrument in national emergency doctrine, invoked to centralize authority, enable rapid mobilization, and restrict civil liberties for the sake of wartime efficacy. Understanding how and why states prolong such measures\u2014especially under unresolved military conflict\u2014allows me to assess the likelihood of continued emergency rule with keen attention to precedent, practical necessity, and regime incentives.",

Dissent in parliament is notable but not yet existentially threatening to the government\u2019s emergency powers, and the slow-moving nature of both battlefield and political developments in Ukraine makes a sharp break from the status quo extremely unlikely on this timeline.

Political opposition is vocal but lacks the numbers or leverage to block an extension. The security dilemma\u2014Ukraine cannot risk demobilization or loss of centralized control while under threat\u2014makes it extremely likely martial law will be extended.

The Ukrainian government has extended martial law 16 times already without interruption. Despite mounting domestic criticism and some elite dissent, public willingness to return to elections before war\u2019s end remains low, and Western partners have not strongly pressured for normalization. The front is stalemated and both military and political reporting suggest no imminent breakthrough toward peace. The ruling coalition retains parliamentary control and the executive\u2019s incentive to maintain martial law is very strong, both for internal security and political survival. Therefore, the probability of yet another extension\u2014at least for another 90 days beyond November 5\u2014is extremely high. Only an unforeseen and dramatic change in the war or internal politics could alter this trajectory. Given these factors, and weighting the strong base rate, I assess the probability at 97%.",
