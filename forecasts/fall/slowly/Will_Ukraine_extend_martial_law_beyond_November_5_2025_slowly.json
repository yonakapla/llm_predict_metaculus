While there is growing elite criticism and some public fatigue, neither parliamentary opposition nor public opinion has reached a threshold to override the status quo, especially with only 11% supporting elections before the war ends. International partners are not pushing hard for an end to martial law, and Russia's complaints about Zelenskyy's legitimacy have not forced a diplomatic breakthrough. There is no credible sign that a peace deal or ceasefire will occur before November 5. Institutional inertia and the path dependency of repeated renewals weigh heavily toward continuation. Therefore, the probability that Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025 is extremely high.",
