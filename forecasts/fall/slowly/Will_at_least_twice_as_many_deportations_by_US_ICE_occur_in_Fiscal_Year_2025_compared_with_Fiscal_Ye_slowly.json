The agency sets daily arrest quotas but falls short (as reported in Fox News, NaturalNews). An annual total of removals rises, perhaps to 350,000\u2013400,000 (a modern record), but well below the ~543,000 mark needed for a Yes. Political blowback from labor shortages and court injunctions further slow enforcement mid-fiscal-year.",

Political costs are tolerated, and a relentless multi-agency push drives total removals to >543,000 for FY2025\u2014something no administration has previously achieved.",

Even optimistically, operational barriers, legal constraints, and historic base rates make a doubling effectively out of reach absent a revolutionary change (which we do not observe as of late September 2025). No news article credibly projects a removal pace or actual removals totaling even half a million, and most cite the official ICE and DHS stats showing rates that would at best set a modern record, but not a doubling. The status quo is strong: orders of magnitude increases are extremely rare in bureaucratic, highly scrutinized law enforcement systems \u2014 and labor, political, and legal pushback is already mounting. Therefore, the probability of a Yes outcome is vanishingly small but not literally zero due to extreme tail risk (\u201cBlack Swan\u201d-type events).\n\nSynthesizing all available evidence: the chance that ICE's reported fiscal year 2025 removals total at least twice those of FY2024 (i.e., \u2265 542,968) is near zero.",
