The demographic cliff is now hitting, shrinking the pool of potential students. At the same time, federal policy changes have reduced financial aid and basic needs support, making college less accessible for the most vulnerable. Cultural and labor market shifts are driving more young people directly into trades, apprenticeships, or employment, especially as skepticism about the value of a degree rises and AI threatens white-collar job prospects. Institutional closures and capacity reductions further limit access, especially in rural and low-population states. While there are still strong enrollments in health and STEM fields, and some states are trying to offset declines, these efforts are insufficient to counteract the broader national trends. Recent NCES and IPEDS data indicate enrollment rates are already very close to the threshold, and the sharpest effects of the demographic cliff and policy changes are likely manifesting in the 2025 data. The risk is weighted toward a Yes outcome, but not so extreme as to be certain, since base rates show gradual rather than sudden decline and there is some inertia in the system.",

Anecdotally, some youth are applying abroad or opting out entirely.\n\nHowever, the US college enrollment rate for 18-24 year-olds historically moves slowly, and most of the recent enrollment declines (2020-2022) were in 2-year institutions or among older students. The base rate for a \u226510% drop over a decade is low; the last time enrollment declined so much was under extreme economic or policy shocks. While 2025 is likely to show the lowest rate in decades, a drop from 29.9% to below 26.91% is still a large move in a short time. On balance, the probability is higher than it would have been 2-3 years ago, but still not the most likely scenario.\n\nMy final estimate weighs: (1) the slow historical movement of this rate, (2) concrete policy/economic barriers that likely accelerate decline, (3) the demographic cliff's ambiguous effect on the percentage, and (4) base rates for large, quick reversals. I judge the likelihood of a \u226510% drop to be plausible but not the default.",

However, this forecast period (2015-2025) is shaped by several powerful, converging headwinds: the demographic cliff is now hitting enrollment rosters, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has made college less affordable for the most vulnerable, and the cultural tide has shifted against the necessity of a four-year degree. Data from NCES and recent reporting confirm that undergraduate enrollment in the US had already declined from 2015 to 2023 by about 10% in absolute numbers, and the college-going rate (share) for 18-24 year-olds was trending downward, from about 40% in 2015 to roughly 38% in 2022 (note: this is for any postsecondary enrollment, not strictly four-year colleges, but the trend is similar). Considering the population denominator is shrinking, if absolute enrollments fall faster than the youth population, the share can drop by 10% or more. Policy adaptation and labor market incentives may cushion the blow but are unlikely to fully offset the combined effects. Recent news does not indicate a reversal of these trends in late 2025. Therefore, I judge the probability that the 2025 rate is at least 10% lower than 2015 to be moderately high, though not a certainty, as inertia and adaptation could keep the rate just above the threshold.",

However, the current period is unusually disruptive: the demographic cliff is real and hitting in 2025, policy changes are actively making college less affordable, and cultural skepticism is at a postwar high. Recent NCES data (2021-2023) shows that enrollment has already declined by about 8% since 2015, meaning only a modest further drop is needed for this question to resolve 'Yes.' The pandemic's shock lingers, and colleges are closing at unprecedented rates. However, credentialist inertia and the ongoing requirement of degrees for many jobs put a brake on the collapse. The most recent news and data suggest we are right on the cusp: a further 2-3 percentage point drop in the 18-24 college enrollment rate would tip us into the 'Yes' zone. Given the compounding negative factors, but also the stickiness of the credentialist regime, I assess about a 60% chance that the rate will be at least 10% below the 2015 benchmark when 2025 data is published.",
