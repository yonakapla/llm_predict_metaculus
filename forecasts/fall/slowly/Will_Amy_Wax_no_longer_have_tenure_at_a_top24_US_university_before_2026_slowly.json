The university will be legally cautious about further action until litigation is resolved or a clear-cut, egregious new violation occurs. The news as of late November 2025 confirms Wax\u2019s suspension and salary reduction, not tenure removal. The process for revoking tenure is complex and time-consuming; with only a month remaining, it is virtually impossible for Penn to complete all due process steps required to revoke tenure.

The time remaining before January 1, 2026, is very short for the university to launch and complete a new, more severe disciplinary process, especially given the due process and legal appeal requirements for tenured faculty.
