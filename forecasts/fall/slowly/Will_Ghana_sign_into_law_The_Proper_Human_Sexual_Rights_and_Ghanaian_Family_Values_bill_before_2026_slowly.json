The time window is shrinking, but Ghana's legislative history shows that, when the political will exists and societal pressure is high, major laws can be pushed through rapidly. Given the urgency from Parliament and religious groups, and Mahama's need to satisfy a public mandate, the probability is high, but not certain.

However, several months of inaction despite pressure from powerful actors (religious and political) suggest significant obstacles remain. International condemnation and threats of aid withdrawal, plus Ghana\u2019s abstention at the UN, signal that the government is wary of reputational and economic costs. The President\u2019s stated preference for a government bill, not a private member\u2019s bill, is a major procedural hurdle, especially given that Parliament and government are not fully aligned. The pattern of delays, highlighted by both majority and minority party accusations, and the unresolved political infighting, suggest a real risk of the deadline passing without formal assent. Nevertheless, the overwhelming public support, the rising tide of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the region (e.g., Burkina Faso), and the intense domestic pressure from religious and political leaders mean that a late push to sign or re-pass the bill is plausible if the President calculates that delay is riskier than action. Given the short time to resolution, persistent procedural obstacles, but extremely high domestic pressure, the most likely scenario is continued delay, with a significant but not overwhelming chance of a breakthrough.

The main countervailing forces are legal/procedural obstacles and potential international aid consequences, but there is little evidence these have been sufficient to stop passage elsewhere in the region. President Mahama has political incentives to sign, despite some ambiguity about the bill's form (private vs. government). The balance of factors from a moral panic sociology perspective heavily favors a 'Yes' outcome, but the possibility of procedural/leadership delay cannot be fully discounted. Thus, my estimate is higher than 50%, but not maximal.",

However, the recent Supreme Court dismissals, intensified pressure from religious and political elites, regional legislative trends, and the lack of effective domestic opposition suggest that the social and political cost of not signing is growing. The remaining time window is short, but not unusually so for a motivated government to act, especially with Parliament reconvening imminently and the bill already resubmitted. While there are real risks of continued delay, the sociological and political forces favor passage.

There is strong domestic support for the bill, and regional examples of recent passage (Burkina Faso, Mali) embolden Ghanaian legislators and reduce perceived risk. However, Mahama is an experienced international actor and aware of Ghana's economic vulnerabilities, with the ongoing IMF program and significant Western donor leverage. The fact that the government has not yet acted, despite months of public and parliamentary pressure, suggests continued elite caution. Still, the convergence of resolved legal challenges, overwhelming societal/religious pressure, and regional trends marginally outweigh the executive's incentives to delay. I therefore estimate a modestly above-even chance the bill will be signed into law before the end of 2025, but do not go more extreme due to the persistent pattern of executive delay in similar cases and Ghana\u2019s economic exposure.",
