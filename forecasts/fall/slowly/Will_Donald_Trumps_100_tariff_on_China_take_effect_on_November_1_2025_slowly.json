Multiple news articles report that Trump quickly signaled possible moderation, and history suggests that last-minute deals or delays are likely, especially around high-profile summits. While China\u2019s rare earth controls are a significant escalation, both sides have reasons to avoid a trade war spiral. As of October 15, the evidence strongly favors a delay, walk-back, or partial imposition, not the full 100% tariff taking effect on the stated date. The main risk to this forecast is a total diplomatic breakdown or a political calculation that makes retreat impossible for Trump, but this is less likely given the short time frame and historical precedent.",

The legal and administrative complexity of imposing a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports within 18 days further reduces probability, as does the acute business and market backlash. While the rare earths dispute is unusually severe, and both sides have escalated, the most likely outcome is a delay, suspension, partial implementation, or rapid walk-back.

This is prompted by market pressure, diplomatic negotiations at the APEC summit, or Chinese counter-offers such as modest rare earth export carve-outs or promises to resume ag purchases. The result: no new 100%+ tariffs are actually imposed as of November 1, 2025.",
            "yes_scenario": "Talks break down completely, the APEC meeting is canceled or ends in acrimony, both sides escalate, and Trump follows through on the threat, instructing US Customs to collect 100% tariffs on a wide swath of Chinese imports effective November 1, 2025. This could be driven by a calculation that a dramatic move is necessary either for domestic political reasons or to force China back to the table after what is perceived as a gross escalation by Beijing.",
            "final_reasoning": "Despite the bombastic announcement and the seriousness of China's rare earth export controls, the preponderance of evidence from both Trump's negotiating history and the structural economic incentives on both sides point to a walk-back, delay, or substantial dilution of the 100% tariff threat. The news articles and expert commentary overwhelmingly highlight the pattern of high-profile threats followed by last-minute deals or postponements\u2014so much so that it has a market nickname ('TACO'). The negative financial market reaction further strengthens incentives for Trump to claim victory but avoid actual implementation. The APEC summit provides a diplomatic window, and both sides have not fully closed off talks. The base rate for the US actually implementing a sudden, maximal 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, especially within weeks of the announcement and in the face of massive market turmoil, is very low. While Trump's unpredictability means a tail risk of follow-through exists, the most compelling, status-quo-grounded forecast\u2014especially by China Studies standards\u2014places the probability of actual implementation at well below even odds.",
