Historical data shows that, even in disease-outbreak years, overall sales have not sharply spiked, partly because outbreaks are often met with culling, enhanced biosecurity, or emergency vaccination, not routine antimicrobial upscaling. Ongoing regulatory and retailer pressure, One Health policy goals, and advancements in diagnostics all bias outcomes toward at most a stable or modestly declining trend.

The annual report shows 2024 sales below the 0.5% increase threshold relative to 2023.",
            "yes_scenario": "A confluence of factors in 2024\u2014such as a major disease outbreak in livestock, supply-chain glitches limiting preventive inputs (e.g., vaccine shortages), or production surges to meet increased demand\u2014triggers precautionary and therapeutic upticks in antimicrobial use across major sectors (poultry, swine, cattle). The increased sales surpass the 0.5% threshold compared to 2023, despite stewardship counter-pressures.",
            "final_reasoning": "Based on the strong status quo trend of steady/slightly declining medically important antimicrobial sales in U.S. livestock, ongoing and possibly intensifying stewardship/regulatory pressures, and a lack of U.S.-specific news indicating a significant shock in 2024, the default is flat or declining usage. While reports of increased livestock disease and global sector growth slightly increase risk, these are offset by preventive/vaccine emphasis and regulatory vigilance in the U.S. The threshold for a 'Yes' resolution (a >=0.5% increase, i.e., sales at least 6,158,631 kg) is notable but small; however, trends point down or flat. My base-rate-driven reasoning, with allowance for disease-driven blips, makes a modest but not extreme 'No' forecast most compelling. I assign an 80% probability that antimicrobial drug sales for livestock in the U.S. will NOT increase by at least 0.5% in 2024 relative to 2023.",
