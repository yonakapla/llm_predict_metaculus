However, the U.S. legal system moves slowly, and appeals/stays are common in high-profile cases. The FEC and DOJ are historically cautious, especially in gray-area or First Amendment-adjacent campaign activity. The resolution criteria require a final, un-overturned ruling by any court or regulator\u2014not just a lawsuit proceeding or a preliminary ruling. Given the time left (2.5 months), the likelihood that a final, standing ruling of illegality emerges (and is not stayed/appealed) is moderate but below even odds. Base rates for novel campaign finance enforcement or lottery law cases involving innovative tactics and national political figures suggest that clear, timely, and un-overturned findings of illegality are rare within a year of the conduct. Balancing the real legal risk (as evidenced by federal judges\u2019 rulings) with the slow pace and high bar for finality, a probability in the 25\u201330% range is justified.",

The relevant lawsuits are still in early or mid-stages, and U.S. courts are slow, especially in high-profile, novel cases. Even if a trial court were to rule against Musk, appeals would almost certainly be filed, likely staying enforcement or finality until after the resolution deadline. The courts\u2019 previous hesitancy to grant injunctions, the ambiguous statutory context, and the procedural posture of current litigation all weigh against a 'Yes' resolution. The base rate for courts or regulators retroactively declaring high-profile election incentives illegal within a year of the event is extremely low.
