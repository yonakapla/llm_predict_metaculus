Additionally, the FEC is historically slow and divided in enforcement actions, and no news suggests it is on the verge of a ruling.

Musk) is still in pretrial proceedings and, barring an expedited summary judgment, is unlikely to reach a final, not-stayed ruling by December 31, 2025; and (5) that the resolution criteria require a definitive, not-overturned finding of illegality. Although there is mounting legal pressure and some plausible legal arguments for illegality, the preponderance of process and precedent suggest that, as of the resolution date, no court or regulator will have rendered a final, unappealed ruling that Musk's giveaway is illegal.
