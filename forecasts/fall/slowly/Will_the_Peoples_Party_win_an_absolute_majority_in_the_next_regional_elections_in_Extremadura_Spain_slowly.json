            "final_reasoning": "All public polling, both state (CIS) and private, converges on a projection of 25\u201330 seats for the PP\u2014well below the 33 needed for an absolute majority. Polling error, regional volatility, and the late-campaign dynamics could theoretically allow a seat surge, but the size of the gap is substantial. The structure of the party system, the recent history of coalition governance, and the proportional representation system all decrease the likelihood of an outright majority. The Median Voter Theorem suggests the PP cannot monopolize the center with Vox on the right and PSOE on the left. While Gallardo\u2019s legal troubles may suppress PSOE turnout, the evidence from polling does not show a collapse sufficient to allow a PP landslide. Even factoring in undecided voters, the probability of the PP surpassing 33 seats is low. Base rate considerations reinforce this: absolute majorities are rare in modern Extremadura. Therefore, the most likely scenario is the PP wins, but not with an outright majority.",

No poll in the last month projects an outright PP majority; even the most optimistic estimates cap PP at 30 seats. The fragmentation of the right (with Vox surging) structurally limits PP's ability to consolidate the center-right vote. The collapse of the previous PP-Vox coalition and mutual distrust further diminishes tactical voting potential. While the PSOE's troubles and left-wing fragmentation might help PP, Unidas por Extremadura is absorbing some of the PSOE's losses, not PP. Social Identity Theory suggests most voters' party loyalties are stable, and Spanish regional elections rarely see sudden, massive shifts in the final days without a major disruptive trigger. With 16% undecided, a small late swing is possible, but the base rate for a single party jumping from 28 to 33+ seats in such a context is very low. The most likely outcome is PP wins but remains short of an absolute majority, needing Vox or PSOE abstention to govern. There is a small (but not zero) tail risk of a late surge, so the probability is not at the absolute minimum.",
