OpenAI\u2019s willingness to compromise might be high, but the window for such a partnership is tiny and shrinking, especially as China promotes its own LLMs. No recent news indicates any ongoing negotiation or product adaptation for China. Even if OpenAI wanted to launch in China, the time left (just over 2 months) is extremely short for such a complex regulatory process.
