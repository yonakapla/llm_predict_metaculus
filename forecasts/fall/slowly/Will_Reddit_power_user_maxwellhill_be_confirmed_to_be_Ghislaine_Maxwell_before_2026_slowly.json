Routine Activity Theory suggests there is no convergence of motivated offenders (whistleblowers, hackers, prosecutors) with both access and incentive to publicly confirm this theory. The base rate for such claims being confirmed is vanishingly small, and neither her legal battles nor Congressional scrutiny have produced new revelations to date. While there is an outside chance that her testimony or a major leak could produce new evidence, the absence of movement after years of speculation and the lack of relevance of the Reddit identity to her ongoing legal strategies make a 'Yes' scenario highly improbable.",
