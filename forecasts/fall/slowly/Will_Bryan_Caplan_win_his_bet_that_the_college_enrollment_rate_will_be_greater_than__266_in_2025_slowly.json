Still, international students make up only about 5% (all ages, all levels) of 4-year college enrollment, and the sharp decline in new entrants will only partially impact the total 2025 headcount, as many international students already in the U.S. remain enrolled.

The demographic headwinds from a shrinking population of 18-year-olds add to the pressure. However, the U.S. college enrollment rate\u2014especially in 4-year institutions\u2014has historically been sticky, with declines usually gradual except during acute shocks (e.g., COVID-19). The base rate for a >10% decade-over-decade drop is low. Institutional responses\u2014waiving fees, easier admissions, direct offers\u2014are unprecedented and likely to cushion losses among domestic students. The overall international student stock is less affected than the new cohort, due to OPT and longer graduate stays, but the 18-24-year-old undergrad metric is more sensitive to the new intake. Given that the most recent NCES Digest data (2023) showed enrollment rates for 18-24-year-olds at 4-year colleges still above 27%, and that the cumulative impact of all factors is likely to push the rate down but not catastrophically so, the most likely outcome is a modest drop, not a sharp collapse.

Since international students make up a disproportionate share in certain institutions but a moderate proportion overall, the effect on the aggregate 18-24-year-old enrollment rate is meaningful but not catastrophic. Domestic colleges are responding by further easing admissions, but public skepticism regarding degree value and funding cuts are headwinds. The key question is whether the international student shortfall, coupled with demographic and attitudinal headwinds, is enough to drive the rate down by more than a full percentage point from 2023 (approx. 27.5%).

Most importantly, the base rate of large, abrupt declines in this metric is low: declines are usually gradual. Even with the international student collapse, the total international student population is a small fraction of all 18-24-year-olds (1.2 million total international students across all levels; only a subset are in four-year undergraduate programs and within the 18-24 band).

The most recent news is unambiguously negative for enrollment: a 17% drop in new international students, visa delays, and a continued domestic headcount decline. However, two offsetting factors are crucial: (1) Aggressive and creative institutional recruitment/retention strategies are now being deployed at scale, which tends to blunt sharp downward trends; and (2) The denominator (total 18-24 year-olds) is also shrinking, which can 'soften' the impact on the percentage rate if the numerator doesn't fall as fast as it might appear. The international student drop is more impactful for overall headcount than for the 18-24 domestic cohort (the bet's denominator), as many international students are older (especially at the graduate level). Most international undergraduates are also concentrated at a relatively small number of institutions. While the 2025 news cycle is more negative than in past years, and a breach is more plausible than ever, the question asks whether the rate will fall 'more than 10%' from 2015\u2014an unusually large drop in a single decade for such a slow-moving metric. On balance, I judge the likelihood that Caplan wins (i.e., enrollment remains above 26.6%) as slightly better than even, but much less certain than a year ago.

However, schools are responding with unprecedented adaptations: waiving application fees, extending deadlines, offering automatic/direct admission, and increasing aid. These measures can only partially offset losses, particularly as international students (who are not easily replaced) account for a disproportionate share of four-year enrollments. My human capital perspective highlights that the marginal domestic student is more likely to opt out now than a decade ago. While the international enrollment collapse is damaging, not all international students are in the 18-24 age bracket, and some overall numbers are held up by increased graduate OPT participation. Given the magnitude of the international shock and the continuing domestic headwinds, but also considering historical inertia and institutional adaptation, I judge that the enrollment rate will likely come close to the 26.6% threshold, but is more likely than not to fall below it.

On the other hand, colleges are responding with aggressive admissions reforms, lowering barriers, and offering more aid to stabilize enrollment. Given the inertia in status attainment norms and the likelihood that institutions will squeeze out marginal gains domestically, I expect the four-year rate to fall, but not in a cliff-like fashion.
