This expertise allows me to gauge whether ongoing lawsuits are procedurally likely to result in a $100M+ court-ordered payout or fine, and to distinguish settlements (which do not count unless court-ordered) from true judicial orders. I can also analyze how recent procedural wins, settlements, and judicial reasoning affect the likelihood of a qualifying outcome within the narrow remaining time window.",

OpenAI/Microsoft lawsuit in SDNY) accelerates dramatically: the court certifies the class, discovery and summary judgment are completed in record time, and the judge issues a damages order or fine of at least $100M specifically for use of data in AI training. Alternatively, a default judgment, sanctions, or a court converting a settlement into a damages order could trigger the YES outcome, but this is rare absent misconduct.",

The key lawsuits (OpenAI/Microsoft, Apple, Salesforce, Midjourney, Perplexity) are all still at relatively early or mid-stage: surviving motions to dismiss or newly filed, but a final damages phase is many months away. The Anthropic payout, while large, was a settlement, not a damages order, and the court did not convert it into a judgment. No news indicates imminent trial or expedited summary judgment in any qualifying case. Even with recent judicial openness to plaintiffs' claims, class certification, discovery, damages calculation, and appeals are time-consuming. In my experience, even the most 'rocket-docket' federal cases rarely reach a $100M+ judgment within months of a motion to dismiss ruling. The incentives for both sides still heavily favor settlement. Therefore, the probability that a US court will actually order a company to pay $100M+ for AI training data before 2026 remains very low\u2014though not zero, given the current legal momentum and possibility of a surprise (e.g., default judgment or sanctions).",

The Anthropic $1.5B payment was a settlement, not a court order, and thus does not resolve this question as YES. While the legal and financial risks are clearly increasing for AI companies, and future years may see such orders, the short time window remaining is the dominant consideration. Barring an unprecedentedly fast litigation process or a surprise government fine (for which there is no public evidence), the base rate for a court-ordered payment this large, in this context, within two months, is extremely low.

The procedural history of analogous copyright class actions (e.g., Google Books, Viacom v. YouTube, Napster, LimeWire) shows that such cases nearly always take multiple years to reach judgment. Even recent cases that survived motions to dismiss (OpenAI, Apple, Reddit) have just entered discovery, and trial dates are likely well into 2026 or later. The Anthropic settlement, while large, was not a court order. Judges are typically reluctant to set new precedent in unsettled areas, especially with possible Supreme Court review looming and the fair use question unresolved. The most likely scenario is that companies continue to settle, or courts defer or limit damages pending appeal. The only plausible 'yes' path is a surprise fast-track or default, which is rare for such high-profile defendants.

The OpenAI 'Game of Thrones' class action has just survived a motion to dismiss, but it is only now entering discovery and possibly class certification, making a final judgment by year-end extremely unlikely given the pace of US litigation. Major cases against Salesforce, Apple, and others are similarly at early or mid-stage. The historical base rate for $100M+ copyright judgments within months of a procedural win is extremely low. Most such cases either settle or end in smaller damages after trial. While ongoing procedural victories and the Anthropic settlement signal that large awards are possible, the probability of a qualifying court-ordered fine or payment within the next two months remains low.

Courts are historically slow, and while fair use remains unresolved, it is possible a major verdict could be reached in the high-profile New York OpenAI case, but with just two months left, it is more likely the case will delay or settle rather than conclude with a $100M+ court order.

The existence of insurance and investor-backed funds may make large settlements easier, but does not increase the speed of court rulings.

Class actions of this scale, particularly those involving unsettled legal questions like AI and copyright, typically take years to resolve in court. The recent Anthropic settlement, while large, was not a court order and thus does not trigger a YES resolution. Given the strong incentives for both sides to settle rather than risk an adverse, precedent-setting judgment, and the lack of any court-ordered damages to date, the window for a qualifying YES outcome is very narrow.
