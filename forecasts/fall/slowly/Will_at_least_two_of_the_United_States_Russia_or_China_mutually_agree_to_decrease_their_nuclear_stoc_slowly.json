The main obstacle is the lack of formal negotiations and the short timeline (about 3.5 months). China is almost certain not to participate, but the question only requires two parties. While bureaucratic and policy inertia may slow things down, the political imperative to avoid the complete collapse of nuclear arms control (and the relatively simple nature of a one-year extension) means that a last-minute deal remains plausible. Given all factors, the probability of a formal, signed U.S.-Russia agreement to decrease (or limit) their nuclear stockpiles, such as a New START extension, is higher than the long-term historical base rate but still faces significant implementation risk.

Arms control treaties, especially those involving reductions and mutual verification, are complex legal and technical instruments that require significant groundwork. The absence of formal negotiations, the technical and political obstacles presented by Russia\u2019s suspension and the Ukraine war, and the lack of movement from China all weigh heavily against a YES. The only plausible YES scenario is a last-minute, symbolic extension of New START between the US and Russia, but even this faces significant hurdles in the time remaining. Given the high bar set by the resolution criteria (signed formal agreement between at least two of the three), and the lack of concrete progress beyond public statements, I estimate the probability of a YES outcome at 15%.",
