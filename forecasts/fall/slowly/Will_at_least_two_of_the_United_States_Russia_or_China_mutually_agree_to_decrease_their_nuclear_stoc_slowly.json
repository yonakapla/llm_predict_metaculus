China\u2019s outright refusal means a trilateral agreement is extremely unlikely, so only a U.S.-Russia deal is plausible. The main risks are bureaucratic inertia, potential last-minute political reversals, or the extension being derailed by unrelated crises. However, given the high-level buy-in and the relatively low bar (just a signed extension, not ratification or implementation), and the evident urgency with New START expiring in less than four months, the probability is now well above historical base rates for new arms control pacts, but not a slam-dunk due to persistent risk factors.

Given the news, base rates, and my expertise on the procedural hurdles, I judge there is a modest but real chance of a last-minute formal extension between the US and Russia, but no plausible path for any agreement involving China.

The main obstacles are procedural (moving from rhetoric to a signed text) and possible last-minute domestic or diplomatic breakdowns, but these are surmountable, especially given the low bar (the extension does not require ratification, just signing). Given the base rate for such extensions during treaty expiry crises and the clear mutual interest, a US-Russia YES outcome is more likely than not, but not overwhelming. I estimate about a 65% probability that Trump and Putin will sign an extension or similar treaty before 2026, resolving this as YES.

The process for formalizing such agreements is slow, and the timeframe is short. China remains a non-starter.

The base rate for new arms control agreements is very low, but extensions of existing ones are somewhat more common, especially under crisis conditions. Weighing these factors, the probability is above zero but well below even odds, with the most likely path to YES being a last-minute bilateral U.S.-Russia extension or freeze rather than a true reduction.

The base rate for end-of-treaty arms control extensions between the US and Russia is moderately high, especially when both leaders are inclined. Nonetheless, the window is tight, and the Ukraine war means trust is low, and last-minute breakdowns are possible.
