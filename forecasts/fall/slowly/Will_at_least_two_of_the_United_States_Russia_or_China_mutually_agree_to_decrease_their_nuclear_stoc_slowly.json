However, with only about four months left, the absence of actual negotiations, the complexity of US-Russia relations, and potential domestic or technical obstacles (including debates about verification and Ukraine-related sanctions) keep the risk of failure significant. The base rate for new arms reduction treaties is low, but extensions during periods of mutual interest are not uncommon. Given the preponderance of positive signals but the lack of a formal deal, I assess the probability above 50% but not dramatically higher, especially since the extension may face last-minute hurdles, and the precise resolution may hinge on how 'decrease' is interpreted.

China\u2019s categorical refusal to participate means a trilateral deal is nearly impossible; thus, the only plausible YES scenario is a US-Russia bilateral extension. However, even a bilateral extension, while theoretically possible, would require more than verbal assent and typically involves negotiation of verification, legal text, and signatures at a formal meeting. The status quo bias, base rates for treaty formation, and absence of formal negotiations or draft texts all strongly suggest that the status quo will persist. Liberal Institutionalism notes that while institutions and prior agreements matter, absent a strong, coordinated bureaucratic push and mutual trust, last-minute extensions of such high-stakes treaties are very rare.

The main obstacle is the need for a formal, signed agreement before the deadline, which is not trivial given mutual suspicions, the war in Ukraine, and potential last-minute political obstacles. However, the base rate of last-minute arms control deals between the US and Russia is relatively high, especially when both leaders are on record as supporting the extension.

However, even this faces significant procedural, legal, and domestic hurdles in both countries. Given the short timeline, history of slow-moving arms control processes, and the fact that positive rhetoric does not easily or quickly translate to formal treaties, the probability is higher than in a typical year but still well below even odds. I estimate a 30% chance that US and Russia mutually agree and sign an extension or new reduction agreement before 2026, and essentially 0% for any agreement involving China. Weighting all factors\u2014especially status quo bias, the short window, and bureaucratic complexity\u2014I assign a final probability of 30%.",

China\u2019s categorical refusal removes the trilateral scenario. The most plausible YES scenario is a last-minute, face-saving bilateral US-Russia extension or interim agreement.
