Greenland continues to seek economic development and security partnerships with democratic allies (U.S., EU, Japan), but sovereignty remains unchanged. Denmark, backed by EU partners, reaffirms its commitment to Greenlandic self-determination and territorial integrity. Any U.S. influence operations or backchannel contacts do not result in a public, formal announcement of negotiations.",
            "yes_scenario": "A major, unexpected political shift occurs: either a dramatic change in Greenlandic leadership or a crisis that causes Denmark to reconsider its stance. Under intense U.S. pressure (possibly economic or diplomatic), Denmark and Greenland jointly agree to enter formal negotiations on sovereignty transfer, and both governments publicly announce this. Alternatively, a rapid Greenlandic independence movement emerges, and the U.S. and Denmark agree to trilateral talks about Greenland's future, explicitly including potential U.S. sovereignty. However, no current evidence supports such a scenario.",
            "final_reasoning": "All available evidence points to the persistence of the status quo: strong constructivist factors (norms of sovereignty, national identity, popular will) heavily weigh against any formal announcement of negotiations for the transfer of Greenland's sovereignty to the U.S. Both the Danish and Greenlandic governments have unequivocally rejected U.S. overtures, and there is no signal of a shift in their position. Greenland's leadership repeatedly affirms openness to cooperation but explicitly excludes the possibility of being 'sold' or transferred. While U.S. interest is real and there are attempts at backchannel influence, these have not translated into public, formal negotiations, and are in fact being rebuffed. The only plausible path to a 'Yes' would require a political earthquake\u2014such as a sudden pro-U.S. Greenlandic government or a Danish capitulation\u2014neither of which is remotely in evidence. The base rate for modern, peaceful transfers of sovereignty between Western democracies is essentially zero in the post-1945 era. Therefore, the probability of a formal, public announcement of negotiations over sovereignty transfer before 2026 is extremely low.",
