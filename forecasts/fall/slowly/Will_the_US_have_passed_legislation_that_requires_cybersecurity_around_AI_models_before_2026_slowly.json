Congress fast-tracks a narrowly targeted AI cybersecurity bill\u2014possibly as an amendment to a must-pass spending or defense bill\u2014requiring organizations in possession of powerful AI models to implement minimum security standards. The law is explicitly intended to mitigate risks from powerful AI systems, meets the resolution criteria, and is signed into law before year-end.",

The remaining time is extremely short, the federal government is deprioritizing new regulation under current leadership, and most activity is at the state or agency level, not through federal law. While global momentum (China, EU) and state-level action (California) do provide some upward pressure, there is no sign of imminent federal legislation meeting the specific resolution criteria. The only plausible path to a Yes outcome is a last-minute crisis-triggered legislative response, which, while possible, is historically rare. As such, my probability must be close to the extreme, reflecting both the short timeline and the slow pace of U.S. legislative change.",
