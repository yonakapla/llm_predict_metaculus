The lack of a secret ballot and the threat of coalition collapse (with no Plan B) further incentivize party discipline. Additionally, German legislative history shows that major social policy packages almost always pass when the government is on the brink and no alternative exists.

The open roll-call vote and existential framing further raise the cost of dissent. The only remaining threat would be an unexpectedly large rebellion or coordinated absence, but the Advocacy Coalition Framework suggests that, with the stakes so high and most intra-coalition bargaining exhausted, status-quo-protecting instincts and coalition discipline will prevail.
