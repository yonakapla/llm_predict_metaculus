However, implementation and behavioral risks are real: recipients may be confused or overwhelmed, and the context of Sierra Leone's health system carries some risk of disruption or reporting delays. GiveWell's internal forecast of 80% reflects these strengths and risks. Recent news does not indicate major new disruptions in Sierra Leone, and the grant and research appear on track as of the latest updates. Statistically, the base rate for detecting significant effects in well-powered, externally funded RCTs in public health in low-resource settings is around 60\u201380%, consistent with GiveWell's estimate.

However, West African health practice experience warns that bundled and complex interventions, or those not sufficiently tailored to local beliefs, often underperform due to cognitive overload, lack of trust, or poor retention. News of ongoing health system stressors and outbreaks raises a minor risk of context-related disruption. GiveWell\u2019s internal 80% forecast feels a bit optimistic given the known behavioral and logistical hurdles, but the balance of design, implementation quality, and prior evidence supports a strong probability of detecting a significant increase, though not near-certainty.
