GiveWell\u2019s 80% internal forecast reflects both optimism in the intervention design and realism about behavioral barriers. The main risks are behavioral overload, cultural resistance, and confusion between ORS/zinc and chlorine, but these are somewhat mitigated by repeated, personalized visits and measurement via both self-report and objective water testing. There is no news suggesting the study is at risk of non-completion or severe disruption. While some attenuation of effect is likely due to the known challenges of sustained behavior change for water treatment, it is more probable than not that the trial will detect a statistically significant increase, even if the absolute increase is not large.
