There is no credible report or even rumor in major business/industry outlets suggesting Bud Light will be discontinued by year-end 2025. The company is attempting new marketing strategies and has the financial capacity to let the brand linger. While the boycott's intensity, category decline, and persistent negative media attention do increase risk relative to historical norms, the window for discontinuation by January 1, 2026 is extremely short, and brands of this scale are not wound down so quickly.

The beverage industry almost never kills off legacy products outright, instead opting for gradual repositioning, cost-cutting, or letting brands fade quietly. AB InBev has both the incentive and the resources to keep Bud Light in production, if only for distribution leverage, brand equity salvage, and the option value of a future turnaround. Recent news shows that the company is focusing growth on other brands, but is still actively considering new marketing for Bud Light, not signaling discontinuation. Even with sales at historic lows, outright cessation before January 2026 would be unprecedented. The only plausible Yes scenarios require either an extraordinary financial catastrophe at AB InBev or some exogenous shock, neither of which is presently indicated. Therefore, the probability that Bud Light will cease production by 2026 is extremely low.",
