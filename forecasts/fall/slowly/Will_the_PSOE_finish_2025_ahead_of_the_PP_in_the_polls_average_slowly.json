All other mainstream pollsters (GAD3, 40db, NC Report, Sigma Dos, DYM, etc.) put PP ahead, typically by 3\u20138 points, sometimes more. Recent poll-of-poll averages using robust weighting continue to reflect this, despite modest tightening.\n\nFrom a weighting/best-practices standpoint, Politico\u2019s aggregators are likely to continue to discount CIS-type outliers and privilege the consensus of more neutral pollsters. The stability of the Spanish party system in the absence of an electoral campaign or large-scale crisis means the odds heavily favor the status quo\u2014PP ahead by a few points through year-end.\n\nTrends and volatility do foreshadow the possibility of a major late-year shift, but historical baseline cautions against it, as polling averages tend to only drift modestly barring seismic events. Additionally, even supportive recent poll movements are not nearly enough to erase a persistent 6-point poll-of-polls lead with only a few months to go.\n\nMy probability adjusts slightly from the strict base rate (~90% NO) to reflect some mild trend and volatility\u2014but not by much.

The CIS is a notorious outlier with a strong pro-PSOE house effect, inflating apparent PSOE momentum in public discourse but not in multi-poll averages. While a small 'momentum' effect is present, the factors that would allow a full reversal (major scandal, exogenous shock, or a polling landslide) are absent or insufficient. With about three months left, the trailing PSOE would need a rapid and sustained reversal reflected across multiple non-CIS polls, and these would need to affect the smoothed poll aggregate quickly. Historically, such sharp turnarounds this late in the window are rare, especially in the absence of elections or dramatic events. Given all this, the chance that PSOE overtakes PP in the Politico poll average by December 31, 2025, is notably low, but not impossible (owing to potential volatility and the risk of last-minute events/polling artifacts).

Historical experience in Spain and across Europe shows that such deltas in poll-of-polls averages do not typically flip in under 3 months without a major externality. Polling volatility, divergent methodologies, and one-off outliers are likely to be smoothed out in the average. The only plausible Yes path would require cascading bad news for PP and/or a full-blown scandal, for which there is currently no evidence.

Outlier CIS polls are discounted in the average.",

Alternatively, an exogenous shock (e.g., economic stimulus package, successful government negotiation on a popular policy, PP-adjacent scandal) prompts pollsters to show PSOE pulling ahead in late December, enough to drive the Politico average narrowly in their favor for poll of polls on Dec 31.",

The only major poll showing a PSOE lead is the government-run CIS, long treated as an outlier with methodological controversies. All other major private pollsters as of September 2025 show PP leading PSOE by 3\u201310 points, with Vox rising and the left's combined share not showing clear recovery. The recent trend shows PP's lead narrowing slightly, but not anywhere near reversal territory. Barring a major, currently invisible shock, it is highly improbable that the PSOE will overtake the PP in poll averages used by Politico by December 31, 2025. Using a grounded approach that emphasizes the status quo and expected inertia, my estimate is somewhat less extreme than zero due to the possibility (though low) of a dramatic late development, but all evidence points strongly to a No outcome.",

The CIS poll is a major outlier, and its effect is largely discounted in the Politico average methodology because it is so divergent and widely perceived as pro-government. The status quo in Spanish polling averages tends to persist outside of election campaigns or extraordinary shocks. The most likely scenario is a narrowing but not reversal of the PP\u2019s lead. Therefore, while a comeback for PSOE is possible should there be a large event or the PP/Vox relationship publicly implode, the base rate, structure of current polls, and historical polling dynamics make a 'Yes' (PSOE leads PP by end of 2025) scenario quite unlikely, but not impossible.
