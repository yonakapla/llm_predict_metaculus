The DRC's M23 escalation is the most plausible candidate, given reports of intense violence and humanitarian crisis, but as of October 2025, there is no definitive evidence in credible open sources that it has crossed the 5,000 deaths threshold this year, nor is it clear it qualifies as a 'new' or 'substantially escalated' conflict per the question's rules.

Cameroon, Venezuela, and other flashpoints show risk signals but have not (yet) seen violence at a scale or intensity approaching 5,000 deaths, and time is running short for such a dramatic escalation.

However, it is not yet definitively established that the death toll has crossed the 5,000 mark, and much of the violence may be diffuse or undercounted. Other global flashpoints show elevated risk, but not enough clear evidence of large-scale new escalation so far. The Security Dilemma lens highlights the potential for rapid spirals, especially where external actors are involved (Rwanda in DRC, U.S. in Yemen, etc.), but also the inertia of state behavior and the frequent failure of incipient escalations to break through the threshold due to international and domestic constraints. The probability is therefore above the base rate but not highly confident, reflecting both the rising risk in places like DRC and the persistent structural factors that usually contain or limit escalation.
