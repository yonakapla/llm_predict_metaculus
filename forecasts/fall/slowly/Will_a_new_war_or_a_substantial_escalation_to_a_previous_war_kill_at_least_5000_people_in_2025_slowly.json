The DRC is the standout risk in 2025, with credible reports of severe escalation, mass displacement, and a surge in casualties and amputations since January. However, while the humanitarian toll is grave, there is not yet clear, public evidence that deaths have reached or will reach 5,000 within the current year, and reporting from the DRC is often incomplete or delayed. Other conflicts (e.g., Sudan, Yemen, Cameroon) do not appear to meet criteria based on available October 2025 information. Given the combination of a low historical base rate, strict qualifying criteria, and only one plausible current candidate, I assess the likelihood as modest but not negligible. I assign a probability slightly above the base rate to reflect the DRC risk and general global volatility, but remain cautious due to strict definitions and the fact that the DRC escalation could still fall short or remain ambiguous in fatality accounting.",

Either fighting remains below this threshold, or data is insufficient to confirm the death toll by resolution time.

The Congo/M23 conflict stands out as the most plausible candidate: reports indicate a dramatic increase in violence and casualties in 2025, with displacement of 7 million and significant rises in amputations and injuries, suggesting mass violence. However, open-source and ICRC data currently focus on injuries and displacement more than direct fatality counts. UCDP and ACLED may eventually confirm deaths crossing the threshold, but as of early October 2025, there is no explicit, widely-accepted reporting of 5,000+ deaths specifically in 2025 and specifically from a conflict under the threshold in 2023/2024. The probability is thus higher than in a typical year due to the Congo escalation, but not overwhelming: there is still meaningful uncertainty regarding whether the death toll will be credibly established and whether it will clear the threshold.

The most credible candidate is the DRC, where the M23 conflict\u2014with strong allegations of Rwandan support\u2014has seen sharp escalation in 2025 (surge in amputees, displacement, and military recruitment), but as of October, open-source and UCDP data do not confirm that fatalities have crossed the 5,000 threshold or that Rwanda has overtly intervened on a new scale. Other risks (Yemen, Cameroon, Venezuela, South Sudan) show deterioration but lack evidence of new, mass-fatality escalations so far. Given these factors, the probability is substantially higher than the long-term average (perhaps 10-12%), but remains below even odds due to the lack of confirmed, ongoing high-fatality new wars as of October.

Other candidates (Venezuela, Cameroon, Yemen) show some risk but less direct evidence of approaching 5,000 deaths in 2025.

Ongoing wars (Ukraine, Gaza, Ethiopia) remain highly lethal but do not qualify as 'new or escalated' under the criteria. Major escalations in DRC, Sudan, Cameroon, etc., either do not cross the 5,000 threshold, or reporting remains too ambiguous for a Yes resolution.",
            "yes_scenario": "A conflict such as the M23-led DRC war, which has seen sharp escalation in 2025, crosses the 5,000 death mark. If credible sources confirm that deaths in DRC (or in another newly escalated conflict zone) exceed 5,000 for the calendar year 2025, and the prior two years were below 1,000/year, the criteria are met. Alternatively, a new interstate war or a major new front (e.g., Rwanda overtly intervening in DRC, or escalation between Sudanese factions) results in 5,000+ deaths.",
            "final_reasoning": "Recent news strongly points to a sharp escalation in eastern DRC, with evidence of mass displacement, large-scale casualties (e.g., hundreds of amputees in a few months), and regionalization (Rwanda involvement). Historical base rates for new or escalated conflicts killing over 5,000 in a year are low, but not negligible\u2014especially in Africa\u2019s Great Lakes region. The Middle East, while extremely violent, has not seen a qualifying new front in 2025 so far. Other hotspots (Sudan, Cameroon) bear watching, but DRC is the standout candidate. Given the news of intensified violence and the humanitarian crisis, it is plausible that deaths in DRC have crossed or will cross 5,000 in 2025, assuming prior years' death tolls were under 1,000 (this needs external confirmation but is suggested by the UCDP data and news reporting). Factoring in the base rate, the status quo, and the specific evidence of escalation, I assess the probability as moderately high but not extreme, since attribution and reporting could still fall short or remain ambiguous.",
