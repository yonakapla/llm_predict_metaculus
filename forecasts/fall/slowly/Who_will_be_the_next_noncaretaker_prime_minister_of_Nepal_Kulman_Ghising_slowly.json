However, Ghising was ultimately appointed NOT as caretaker PM\u2014Karki was chosen instead\u2014suggesting that when push came to shove, elites still preferred a consensus figure with judicial gravitas to a technocratic outsider. The configuration of support that would make Ghising non-caretaker prime minister relies on continued, highly unusual elite-mass alignment and a successful, possibly party-based, post-election coalition\u2014a scenario for which there is no modern precedent in Nepal\u2019s PM selection. Even revolutionary movements in Nepal have historically been co-opted by party figures soon after the dust settles. Technocrats in positions of authority tend either to serve in ministerial roles or revert to bureaucratic appointments after crises. Further, constitutional norms, the stated intent of the caretaker government, and base rates in Nepal and comparable parliamentary systems all favor mainstream party nominees after elections, or disaffected-elite politicians with organized parliamentary support. While his popularity and presence in the Gen-Z protest movement kept him in the running as an interim candidate (and might keep him in some role of authority), it is highly unlikely he will be nominated as the next non-caretaker PM, take the oath, and win a legislative confidence vote under ordinary cabinet-formation rules. Outlier, historic mass mobilization could shift this\u2014but the observed reversion to caretaker/consensus norms after initial chaos suggests only a remote chance.",

Cabinet inclusion reflects both his popularity among protestors and elite efforts to signal reform, while avoiding placing a technocrat at the top in a system dominated by party-political calculus. News reporting confirms Karki was the compromise choice for interim PM, and the status quo is a caretaker government pending elections. Precedent shows PMs are almost always drawn from party ranks via parliamentary deals after caretakership. For Ghising to become PM, a highly unusual, further elite crisis or breakdown of regular parliamentary selection would be required\u2014possible, but historically rare. Therefore, the probability of this specific outcome, given current events and structures, should be low but not zero, slightly above an absolute zero only to reflect radical uncertainty in factional Nepali crises.",

The constitutional process and roles are well understood, and there is no credible sign that Ghising is actively organizing a parliamentary majority or is being groomed as a substitute consensus candidate by the main parties (yet).

After elections, a different coalition leader (almost certainly from an established party, but not Ghising) becomes PM.",
            "yes_scenario": "A major unforeseen crisis (second spike of unrest, elite split, or military/president intervention) destabilizes the caretaker government before January 1, 2026. Kulman Ghising is viewed by Gen-Z, moderate parties, and the military as an acceptable technocratic consensus candidate, and is nominated as non-caretaker PM, sworn in, obtains the required confidence vote, and is serving in this capacity by December 31, 2025.",
            "final_reasoning": "The overwhelming likelihood is that Nepal remains under Sushila Karki\u2019s interim/caretaker leadership until the mandated March 2026 elections. All credible sources report her role as explicitly caretaker, with no current process for selection of a 'regular' PM before those scheduled elections. Kulman Ghising, while respected and previously considered for an interim PM role, was not selected as PM, but as a powerful minister in the emergency cabinet. Historically, Nepal does not elevate technocratic outsiders like Ghising to the top job absent catastrophic collapse or extraordinary consensus\u2014which appears highly improbable given the recent settlement and the exhausted system\u2019s desire for stability. The only plausible path to Ghising's elevation as non-caretaker PM would be a rapid breakdown of the current arrangement\u2014requiring either Sushila Karki\u2019s sudden ouster (due to incapacity, scandal, or collapse of consensus), AND a new elite/youth/military agreement to make Ghising not just interim, but a recognized non-caretaker PM within the next 3.5 months. Current reporting offers no evidence this is in train or likely. Given the stability bias, the explicit timeline, and the settlement's recentness, I assess this scenario as a low-probability tail event\u2014slightly higher than pure zero, due to ongoing volatility and Ghising\u2019s unique standing, but far below 10%.",
