The S&P 500 itself is increasingly tech/AI weighted and will rise if Nvidia rises, reducing the delta for outperformance. However, institutional positioning and continued capital flows into AI and tech, along with macro tailwinds from rate cuts, do tilt the probability slightly in Nvidia\u2019s favor for now. The risk of a correction or style rotation is real, but not the base case as of October 2025, given ongoing positive money flows, strong demand signals, and the absence of immediate negative catalysts. I therefore estimate a modestly above-even probability for Nvidia outperforming the S&P 500 in 2025, but not an extreme or highly confident one.",

Macro tailwinds (rate cuts, AI capex) are likely to persist through year-end, but the risk of a sharp reversal is nontrivial, especially as sentiment is stretched and market breadth narrows. My technical analysis suggests the trend is more likely to persist, but the probability is not extreme: upside and downside risks are both meaningful as we move into Q4. Given Nvidia's weight in the index, there's some self-canceling effect, but on balance, I estimate there is still a moderate edge to Nvidia's outperformance, with a probability notably above 50% but not above 70%.

The S&P 500\u2019s own heavy tech exposure means that a broad tech selloff would hurt both NVDA and the index, but NVDA is more volatile and thus more exposed to downside.
