The status quo favors Nvidia, but the tail risk of a sharp reversal or rotation is real. Given the time left in 2025 and the continued strength in tech, I judge the most likely outcome is that Nvidia does outperform, but with moderate caution regarding over-extrapolating past trends.",

Behavioral momentum is still strong, and macro tailwinds (rate cuts, tech inflows) are in place. However, there are growing warning signs of overexuberance (rising VIX, bubble talk, profit-taking risk), and behavioral finance cautions that crowded trades can unwind rapidly if sentiment shifts.
