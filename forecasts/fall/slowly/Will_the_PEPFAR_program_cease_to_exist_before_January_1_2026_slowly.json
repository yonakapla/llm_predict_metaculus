Despite the near-dismantling of USAID and absorption of functions into the State Department, there is strong evidence that at least a core of PEPFAR's mission continues under the State Department's Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy (GHSD), with waivers for life-saving HIV services and some funds released. No law has been passed to terminate PEPFAR, and federal courts have at times blocked or limited the executive's attempts to fully impound and eliminate funding, though court action has been inconsistent. Historical base rates for fully terminating major global health programs are extremely low, especially within a year. The legal battle over impoundment has not definitively resolved in the administration's favor, and Congress has not acted to kill PEPFAR outright. While the risk of elimination is far higher than at any prior point, and the line between absorption and elimination is blurred by the absorption into State's GHSD, the available evidence\u2014budget carve-outs, partial waivers, lack of a terminating law, and ongoing albeit diminished operations\u2014suggests PEPFAR will narrowly survive in name and core function through January 1, 2026.

Legal challenges have blocked or delayed the total elimination of the program; Congressional appropriations, though reduced, remain in place for now; and there is no clear evidence that any law or effective executive action has yet erased PEPFAR\u2019s existence as a distinct program. The absorption of USAID is unprecedented and increases the risk, but the State Department\u2019s continued PEPFAR reporting and the lack of a 60-day unblocked action eliminating the program suggest the threshold for a 'Yes' resolution has not yet been met. Given the time remaining (just over a month), the high legal and bureaucratic barriers, and the pace of recent developments, the risk of outright, formal PEPFAR termination before January 1, 2026 remains real but not yet probable.",

Alternatively, Congress or the executive branch achieves a full rescission of PEPFAR's funding, and/or a 60-day period elapses in which a presidential action to terminate PEPFAR is not blocked by the courts. All programmatic activities are either ended or absorbed, and there is no longer a distinct PEPFAR program by year-end.",

However, the legal and statutory extinction of PEPFAR is a high bar. The fine print requires either a formal elimination (statutory or by unblocked executive action for 60 days), total funding elimination, or its merger into another agency such that it no longer exists as a distinct program. While the administration has attempted all these, legal ambiguity persists: the courts have allowed continued impoundment, but Congress still appropriates funds and the program's statutory identity is not yet formally repealed or merged. Some minimal life-saving services continue under waivers, and even the administration's new strategy nods to PEPFAR as a framework (albeit a hollowed one). No clear, public legal act or unblocked executive order has yet met the fine print for 'cessation', and the window for doing so is now very short. The historical base rate for a program of this stature vanishing within a year is extremely low. Thus, while the probability is much higher than it would be in any previous year, and despite the catastrophic practical collapse of PEPFAR's operations, the strict, legalistic criteria for 'cease to exist' are likely not yet satisfied. I estimate a significant risk, but the most likely outcome is that PEPFAR\u2014though a shell\u2014technically persists as a program past January 1, 2026.",

Core PEPFAR services (albeit reduced) continue through the State Department, and there are still references to PEPFAR-branded activities in Africa as of late 2025. While the program is a shadow of its former self, the resolution criteria require formal nonexistence as a distinct entity.
