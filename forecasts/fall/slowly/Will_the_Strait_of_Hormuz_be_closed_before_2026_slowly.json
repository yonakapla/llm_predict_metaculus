The resolution criteria are notably easier to meet than a true sustained closure: it only takes a single day with fewer than 10 tankers transiting. This could occur due to either a deliberate Iranian move in response to a major escalation, or a short-lived panic-induced halt in shipping. On the other hand, Iran's economic self-interest (especially vis-a-vis China), the robust deterrent presence of the US and allies, and the fact that even during prior crises (e.g., 1980s Tanker War) the strait never went quiet, all argue for status quo resilience. The recent news indicates no imminent move toward closure, with Iranian oil exports at record highs and no observed mass flight from the strait.

Iranian doctrine emphasizes both leveraging asymmetric means for deterrence and avoiding direct war with major powers. My perspective allows for a grounded assessment of how credible Iranian threats are, how likely Iran is to escalate for domestic or strategic reasons, and how likely the regime is to risk a regional war or catastrophic economic backlash by actually closing the Strait.",

While Iran frequently threatens closure, it has never fully executed this threat (i.e., reducing tanker passage below the threshold of 10 per day) due to the immense economic and strategic costs.",

The US and its allies maintain a robust deterrent presence. China, reliant on Gulf energy, quietly pressures Tehran to avoid catastrophic escalation. Global markets remain jittery, but the physical flow of oil through the Strait continues.",
            "yes_scenario": "A sudden, severe escalation occurs: for example, a major Israeli or US strike hits Iranian territory or leadership, or a miscalculation leads to direct military conflict in the Gulf. Iran responds by mining and/or blockading the Strait, perhaps as a show of force or to demonstrate resolve. For at least one day, effective tanker passage drops below 10, triggering the resolution criteria. The US and allies may intervene militarily to reopen the Strait, but the closure threshold is met.",

Iran has shown credible intent and readiness (mine-loading, parliamentary threats), and US/Israeli attacks have escalated risk. However, actual closure would be catastrophic for Iran itself, risking regime stability, economic collapse, and military defeat. Iranian doctrine and recent behavior suggest that, while brinkmanship is likely, outright closure is a last resort. The shadow fleet\u2019s brief transparency, continued oil exports, and China\u2019s interests all point to Iran avoiding a self-destructive move unless facing an existential threat. With only 2 months left in 2025, the probability of a full closure remains low, but is not negligible given current tensions and the potential for miscalculation or black swan escalation. The most likely outcome is continued threats and minor disruptions, but not a full closure. I assign a probability of 8%.",

Instead, it continues to threaten, harass, and possibly slow traffic, but tanker flows never fall below 10/day. International naval presence, Chinese pressure, and fear of catastrophic self-harm keep Iran below the closure threshold. Oil prices spike periodically, but structural rerouting and insurance mitigate but do not collapse flows.",
            "yes_scenario": "A major escalation occurs\u2014such as a large-scale Israeli or US strike that causes mass casualties among Iranian leadership or devastates critical regime infrastructure. In retaliation, Iran deploys mines and coordinates missile/drone attacks that physically block the Strait for several days. International shippers halt traffic, and daily tanker transits drop below 10. This lasts long enough to meet the Metaculus/IMF Port Watch criteria for a 'closure.' Oil prices skyrocket, and global markets are thrown into turmoil.",
            "final_reasoning": "While the June 2025 crisis brought the Strait closer to closure than any time in decades (with Iran loading mines and credible US intelligence of operational readiness), several strong status quo factors remain. Iran\u2019s threat calculus, economic self-interest, and the lack of historical precedent for a full closure weigh heavily against the probability. The global oil market, Chinese pressure, and the operational difficulty of sustaining a closure against international naval intervention further lower the odds. However, the proximity of recent escalation and Iranian preparations require a higher probability than base rate alone. Given only two months remain in 2025, and with no current evidence of imminent catastrophic escalation, the most likely scenario is continued tension and disruption\u2014but not full closure. The risk is materially elevated (especially compared to years past), but still below the threshold for a high-confidence 'Yes.' I therefore assign a probability moderately above the historical base rate, but not extreme.",
