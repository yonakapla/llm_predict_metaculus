The news flow suggests some movement: indirect contacts, preparation for possible Jeddah-format negotiations, and the explicit statement by US and regional diplomats that talks are 'closer than ever'. The SAF and RSF have both, in principle, welcomed international efforts, but the SAF continues to reject any process that treats RSF as an equal or legitimate force. Both sides are establishing parallel governments, suggesting ongoing zero-sum logic, and external spoilers (UAE, Egypt) are not fully aligned. The base rate from similar conflicts is low, and the short time window (2.5 months) makes a breakthrough unlikely, but not impossible.

The fine print excludes informal, virtual, or sequential attendance, and there is no recent precedent of both delegations attending together. The base rate for direct face-to-face armed party negotiations in such contexts is very low, especially within a short time horizon.

While the probability is not zero\u2014there is a plausible scenario for a last-minute breakthrough under intense pressure\u2014the evidence tips heavily toward 'No.' Given all this, and in line with my practitioner experience, the probability that both SAF and RSF physically attend the same peace negotiation venue before December 31, 2025 is low, but not vanishingly so.",
