The window to organize, convene, and hold a physical meeting is tight (less than three months), and mediation logistics remain daunting.

Statements from SAF as recent as August/September 2025 explicitly reject conciliation, and both sides appear to retain hope for battlefield advantage or at least refuse to grant each other status as legitimate negotiating partners. The international system is mobilized but divided, with external actors (notably the UAE and Egypt) still providing support to their proxies and undercutting unified pressure. Humanitarian catastrophe and international opprobrium have not yet translated into the kind of coercive leverage or internal exhaustion that would force both sides to the same table in person. There is some momentum for symbolic or procedural progress (e.g., setting up talks), and last-minute surprises are possible, but the historical base rate for such direct, in-person meetings in similar contexts remains very low.

The base rate for rapid transitions from indirect to direct in-person negotiation in active African civil wars is low, especially when both sides have strong external sponsors and unresolved legitimacy questions. The SAF\u2019s recent categorical public rejection of conciliation with RSF is a strong negative signal. However, the scale of the humanitarian crisis and the regional/international consensus that neither side can win militarily slightly increase the odds. The next 2.5 months are a short window, though the flurry of diplomatic activity could be a precursor to a breakthrough, albeit more likely in early 2026 than before the end of 2025.

A face-saving formula is devised, perhaps with a high-profile, multilateral venue (e.g., Jeddah, Geneva, or Addis Ababa) and heavy international presence, allowing both sides to claim they are negotiating for Sudan's future, not conceding to the other. Both delegations arrive, under pressure, and are present simultaneously, even if only for opening ceremonies or photo-ops, satisfying the resolution criteria.",

Sudan\u2019s postcolonial state logic\u2014where the state remains a prize for total control\u2014makes such negotiations especially rare unless both sides are exhausted or their patrons force them to the table. Although international pressure is increasing, and humanitarian catastrophe is at unprecedented levels, the preponderance of evidence shows continued hardline posturing, deepening rival administrations, and ongoing external patronage, with little sign of either side preparing to make the necessary concessions for simultaneous, in-person talks. The time frame is very short, and all recent precedents point to either sequential, indirect, or failed negotiation attempts. While a last-minute symbolic meeting cannot be entirely ruled out (especially if external backers shift tactics), the probability remains low but not impossible, given the level of outside attention and catastrophe.
