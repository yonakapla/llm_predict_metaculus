News sources suggest both sides are under sustained pressure and there are credible signals of indirect contacts and increasing urgency. Still, the core obstacles remain: the SAF's public rejection of equivalence and conciliation with the RSF, deep mistrust, and the risk that either side will find pretext to boycott or downgrade their delegation. While the humanitarian crisis provides added urgency, the lack of progress in previous mediation tracks, ongoing proxy competition, and ongoing hard-line rhetoric from both sides mean the status quo remains resilient. Thus, while the probability is higher than at any previous point in the conflict, the chance that both delegations will be physically present at the same venue for official peace negotiations before December 31, 2025, remains below 50%, but above base rates\u2014reflecting both the extraordinary pressure and entrenched obstacles.",

While there is unprecedented international pressure and some signals of momentum, all recent reporting confirms that core issues (mutual recognition, sequencing, external spoilers) remain unresolved. Notably, Al-Burhan and SAF have very recently and publicly reiterated their rejection of parity with RSF, and past mediation attempts have repeatedly failed to get both parties in the same venue. However, the scale of the humanitarian crisis and the diplomatic energy behind the Quad initiative do create a non-trivial chance for a symbolic breakthrough, especially if the international community is able to link aid or sanctions to physical attendance. Overall, the status quo still strongly favors a NO outcome, but the probability is not negligible given the extraordinary context and late-breaking signals of pressure.

However, the empirical base rate for such breakthroughs in deeply entrenched African civil wars with active foreign backing is quite low, especially given the explicit hardline rhetoric from SAF leadership, the existence of parallel governments, and a history of failed mediation. The status quo outcome remains 'no meeting,' but the window for a diplomatic breakthrough is open wider than before (especially if a ceasefire or humanitarian truce is achieved as a first step). Weighing the factors, I estimate a moderate but not high probability: about 30%. This reflects a significant uptick from earlier in the year, but remains cautious given the structural and historical obstacles.",

This lens foregrounds the fragility of state institutions, the tendency for armed actors to claim sovereignty, and the difficulty of forging inclusive, legitimate peace processes in the face of overlapping internal and external interests. It also underscores the importance of elite incentives, the role of regional and international actors, and the deep mutual mistrust between rival factions in shaping negotiation prospects.",

International efforts (Jeddah, Geneva, etc.) have failed to bring both parties together in person; typically, one side attends while the other boycotts or sends only virtual/indirect representation. The status quo is thus continued avoidance of direct, face-to-face negotiations.",

            "no_scenario": "SAF and RSF continue to avoid direct negotiation venues, with each side either boycotting scheduled talks, sending only lower-level or virtual representation, or setting preconditions that render co-attendance impossible. External sponsors remain disunited, and the war continues with high-intensity fighting, mutual delegitimization, and parallel governance structures. International pressure proves insufficient to overcome elite survival logics and mutual distrust.",
            "yes_scenario": "A major inflection point is reached due to catastrophic humanitarian collapse, a key military stalemate, or a shift among external patrons (e.g., coordinated pressure from US, Egypt, UAE, and Saudi Arabia) that forces both SAF and RSF to physically attend a peace negotiation venue. Both sides agree to attend under heavy pressure, possibly as a prerequisite for further military or financial aid, or as part of a new, externally guaranteed process, even if only at the level of designated negotiators (not top commanders).",
            "final_reasoning": "Despite an unprecedented scale of international coordination and explicit calls for direct talks (Quad, AU, UN, etc.), the base rate for such breakthroughs in African conflicts featuring deep mutual distrust, parallel state-building, and strong external sponsorship is low. The news flow suggests some movement\u2014intensive consultations, direct/indirect contacts, and groundwork for possible talks in Jeddah or elsewhere. However, the immediate past is characterized by failed efforts: SAF and RSF have repeatedly avoided co-attendance, and both have hardened positions (e.g., Burhan's repeated public rejection of conciliation; RSF's establishment of parallel authority). External actors remain divided on core principles, and neither side appears militarily exhausted or existentially threatened yet. The humanitarian catastrophe and international pressure could force a breakthrough, but the time window (less than three months) is short, and the status quo is powerful. In sum, while probability is higher than in early 2024, it remains under 50%. I assess a 30% chance that both delegations will physically attend the same peace negotiation venue before December 31, 2025.",
