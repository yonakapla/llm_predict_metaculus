There has been ongoing international and Australian media attention, strong institutional support, and a clear incentive to resolve this high-profile mystery. The circumstantial evidence for a familial relationship is unusually strong for a cold case. Still, the risk of technical failure or ambiguous results cannot be ignored, especially as the deadline approaches.
