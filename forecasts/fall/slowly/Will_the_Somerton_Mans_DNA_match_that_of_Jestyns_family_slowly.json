The circumstantial evidence (physical traits, proximity, and family rumors) makes a biological link plausible. However, the biggest barriers are technical (DNA quality) and procedural (time left and need for formal public confirmation). The lack of any announcement or leak by this late stage, despite significant media and scientific interest, is a strong negative indicator.

The status quo is that no match has been announced, and with only 2.5 months left before the resolution deadline, the probability of a public, authoritative announcement is diminishing. Given the technical challenges, the lack of any recent news suggesting a breakthrough, and the risk of ambiguous or inconclusive results, the most likely outcome is that the DNA will not be matched to Jestyn's family before the end of 2025. However, given the demonstrated power of modern genetic techniques and the international attention on the case, a small but non-zero chance remains.
