Benchmarking experts and internal surveys consistently show that even top researchers do not believe AGI has been achieved. However, the definition of AGI is sufficiently fuzzy, and the competitive dynamic among labs (especially with recent advances like continuous learning) introduces non-negligible risk that a CEO could decide to make a bold claim\u2014especially if they believe rivals are about to do so, or to gain regulatory or financial advantage. Recent statements from Musk (assigning a 10% chance to Grok 5 being AGI), OpenAI's technical progress, and the 'race' narrative slightly raise the probability. Nonetheless, the incentives for caution, reputational risk, and technical uncertainty still outweigh the incentives for making a claim within the next two months.

The reputational and regulatory risks of making an official claim in the current climate\u2014amid global calls for caution and moratoriums\u2014are higher than ever, and most labs have strong governance processes that discourage such statements absent overwhelming justification. While the competitive and definitional ambiguity factors push up the probability, these are offset by the clear lack of consensus and the high cost of a 'false positive' claim.

This could be spurred by a perceived or actual breakthrough, or as a strategic move to shape regulation or capital flows.",

Recent news shows labs are pushing technical boundaries (e.g., continuous learning) and some leaders (Musk) are willing to make bold statements, but even these have stopped short of unambiguous AGI claims. The strong wave of open letters, public fear, and government attention raises the stakes for making such a claim, likely deterring labs from crossing the line before the end of 2025. Hype cycle theory suggests we are at or just past peak hype, and prudent labs will be cautious. The base rate for similar events (clear, public AGI claims) is effectively zero to date. Thus, the probability is low but not zero, as a bold actor could surprise.",

However, competitive dynamics, the presence of high-profile, risk-tolerant leaders, and the race narrative in the media push in the opposite direction, especially as 2025 draws to a close. Recent OpenAI advances and increasingly blurred definitions marginally raise the odds, but persistent skepticism among experts and the lack of a clear technical breakthrough keep the probability well below 50%. Factoring in the base rate (no major AGI claims in previous years, even after dramatic model releases) and the framing incentives, I estimate the probability that a major lab will make a qualifying AGI claim in 2025 at 18%.",

However, the overwhelming regulatory risks, lack of technical consensus, and near-zero historical base rate of such claims make it highly unlikely that a major lab will cross the line in 2025. The strongest evidence from the news is that even as models gain new capabilities (e.g., continuous learning), both internal and external experts acknowledge that major AGI hallmarks remain out of reach. Furthermore, repeated calls for moratoriums and heightened public anxiety make a bold AGI claim reputationally hazardous. The most likely outcome is continued hype, hedging, and 'we are close' messaging\u2014without a definitive AGI claim. Therefore, the probability should be above the absolute minimum, reflecting the nonzero chance that competitive or media pressures tip a leader into making a claim, but still quite low, consistent with both base rates and current incentives.",
