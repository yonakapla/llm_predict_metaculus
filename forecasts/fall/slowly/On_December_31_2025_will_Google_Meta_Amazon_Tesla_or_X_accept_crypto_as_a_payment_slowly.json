Nonetheless, the short time window (2.5 months), the slow pace of enterprise payment system changes, and the historical base rate (near-zero) for such rollouts in major companies weigh heavily against a Yes. X and Tesla are the likeliest to move quickly, but both have a history of big announcements without delivering full checkout functionality. Google, Meta, and Amazon are more conservative and move slower on payment innovations. I believe it is more likely than in any prior year\u2014but still below a coin flip\u2014that any of these companies will actually have crypto checkout live for a core product by December 31, 2025.
