The stablecoin ecosystem is now massive, well-integrated, and perceived as relatively safe compared to volatile cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, direct integration (not via a redirect) is a high bar, and compliance, risk, and technical teams at these companies are slow to move, especially for changes with global implications. The time window is tight and holiday periods further slow enterprise rollouts.
