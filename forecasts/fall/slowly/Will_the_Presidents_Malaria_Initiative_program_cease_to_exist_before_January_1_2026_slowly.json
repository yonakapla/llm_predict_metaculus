The PMI website is down, and field reports confirm mass layoffs and halted operations. While the FY2025 Continuing Resolution maintained funding, the FY2026 budget proposes a near-halving, and there is no indication that Congress will override this in the very short time left before resolution. Importantly, the question\u2019s fine print allows for a 'Yes' if PMI is consolidated/absorbed into another agency and ceases to exist as a distinct organization, which has now occurred. The only meaningful uncertainty is whether bureaucratic inertia, Congressional intervention, or a legal technicality will preserve a nominal PMI existence through January 1, 2026, but the overwhelming trend is toward dissolution.

The October 2025 KFF analysis and news reporting indicate that the reorganization is complete, but ambiguity remains as to whether PMI as a distinct programmatic entity persists in name, budget line, or mission under State. Funding for FY 2025 was level, and the FY 2026 budget proposes deep cuts, but not total elimination. There is no report of a law or 60-day effective executive action terminating PMI outright, and the program\u2019s core mission (malaria control) continues to be supported in some form. The base rate for full program cessation of major U.S. global health initiatives remains low. Therefore, while the probability of a YES outcome is significantly elevated\u2014possibly as high as 30\u201340%\u2014the best-supported forecast, in light of the fine print and lack of clear evidence of full termination or consolidation, remains that PMI will technically still exist in some form on January 1, 2026.",

The question\u2019s stringent resolution criteria\u2014requiring total elimination, not just downsizing or operational paralysis\u2014set a high bar. Historically, the U.S. government rarely fully terminates major foreign assistance programs, especially within a single year, due to legal, bureaucratic, and political inertia. Even with the Trump administration\u2019s clear intent to downsize and disrupt, the absence of explicit legislative repeal, a completed 60-day termination period, or full and public merger/consolidation by the deadline makes a Yes outcome unlikely. The base rate for abrupt program extinction is low, and the evidence suggests PMI is battered but not yet dead.

Yet, the resolution criteria require either formal termination, full merger/consolidation (so PMI is not distinct), or elimination of funding. The transfer to State's GHSD, if accompanied by the elimination of the PMI 'brand' and its distinct operational existence, could satisfy the 'merger' criterion\u2014but reporting suggests that, while the program is nearly moribund, it may still exist as a legal entity or line item. There is no clear evidence that a law has been enacted to terminate PMI or that funding has been fully zeroed before January 1, 2026; the continuing resolution for FY2025 provided full funding, and while the FY2026 budget proposes steep cuts, Congress has not yet acted. The critical variable is whether the merger into State's GHSD (completed July 2025) means PMI no longer exists as a 'distinct' initiative. The reporting is ambiguous, but as of late November 2025, there is no public announcement that PMI has been legally terminated or fully merged/consolidated to the point of ceasing to exist as a distinct program. Thus, while the probability is much higher than historical base rates, the fine print and available evidence indicate that a full Yes resolution is still less likely than No.",

However, funding lines for PMI persist in the FY25 continuing resolution, and even the reduced FY26 budget request proposes a PMI line. Congress has historically been reluctant to completely zero out programs like PMI, especially given bipartisan support. Legal and bureaucratic inertia, as well as recent humanitarian waivers for 'life-saving' malaria work, further buffer against full extinction. However, the risk is higher than ever before: the dissolution of USAID, the operational absorption of PMI functions, and the loss of program distinctiveness mean the resolution criteria could plausibly be met if the new structure is deemed to have terminated PMI as a distinct entity and 60 days elapse without court reversal. Given the very short time to resolution and lack of recent explicit Congressional defense of PMI's institutional identity, the probability of full cessation is elevated, but the base rate of such a program being formally ended within a single year remains low. I judge that the balance of evidence points slightly in favor of PMI surviving in some form through January 1, 2026, but with a significant risk (perhaps the highest ever) of technical extinction.",

News coverage and KFF analysis indicate that while PMI is gutted, no definitive legal or administrative action has yet occurred to eliminate PMI fully as a distinct program; even the severe cuts and reorganizations have left a legal shell in place as of late November 2025.
