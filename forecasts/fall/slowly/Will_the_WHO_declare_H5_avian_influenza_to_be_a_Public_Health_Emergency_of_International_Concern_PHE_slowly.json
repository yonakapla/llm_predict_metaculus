The most recent news includes workshops and international concern, but these are consistent with ongoing pandemic preparedness rather than an imminent emergency. New IHR changes may make a PHEIC declaration even less likely in ambiguous cases, as the bar for international alarm has effectively been raised. With only about 2.5 months until question close, and no reports of critical epidemiological shifts, the likelihood of a PHEIC declaration for H5 before 2026 is low, though not zero due to the inherent unpredictability of influenza.

While the potential for a sudden viral mutation always exists, there is no indication in the news or current scientific reporting of an imminent shift in H5 epidemiology. The window for resolution is short (less than three months), making a major epidemiological shift or a subsequent PHEIC declaration less likely within this timeframe.
