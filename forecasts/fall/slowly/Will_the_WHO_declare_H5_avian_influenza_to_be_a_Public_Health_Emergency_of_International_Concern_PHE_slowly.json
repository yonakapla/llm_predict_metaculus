The latest news confirms that, while there are significant outbreaks in poultry and some deaths among birds, human cases remain very rare and are not associated with sustained transmission. WHO and regional bodies are increasing preparedness and surveillance, but the language from experts and officials consistently emphasizes that human-to-human transmission is not occurring and is not expected imminently. The new IHR amendments and the introduction of a higher emergency category may if anything make the WHO more cautious about declaring a PHEIC for events that do not meet the higher threshold of global health crisis. While the risk of sudden viral evolution is always present, there is currently no signal to suggest such a development is underway. Given the status quo, base rates, WHO's current posture, and the short time to resolution, the probability that a PHEIC for H5 will be declared before 2026 remains low, albeit not zero due to unpredictable viral evolution.",

While the new IHR amendments and global pandemic vigilance could theoretically lower the threshold for a PHEIC, the creation of a new, higher 'pandemic emergency' tier may actually reinforce caution in using the PHEIC label unless the situation deteriorates rapidly. Given the limited time remaining in 2025, the absence of key epidemiological triggers, and the inertia of international health governance, it is likely that the status quo persists. However, the mutation risk is ever-present, and unforeseen developments can never be fully discounted.
