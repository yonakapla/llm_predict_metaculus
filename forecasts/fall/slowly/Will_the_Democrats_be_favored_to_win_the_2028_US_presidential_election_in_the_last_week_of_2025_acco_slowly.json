The news articles highlight Republican momentum and public dissatisfaction with Democrats, but do not suggest an overwhelming market or polling consensus that would flip the betting favorite to Republicans just yet. Given the short time to resolution and the inertia typical in such markets, I expect only a modest shift, if any, before the end of 2025. The base rate for prediction markets at this stage is a near-coin-flip, with perhaps a slight Democratic lean. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that Democrats remain (even if barely) the median favorite on Kalshi for the last week of 2025.

Recent academic work highlights occasional inefficiencies but ultimately points to prediction markets as better aggregators than polls. While the news flow and polling have been negative for Democrats, prediction markets have not fully reflected this, likely due to uncertainty over the 2028 field and the tendency for markets to anchor near 50% absent strong information. Thus, barring a large, unambiguous swing in the next three months, the status quo (Democrats as very slight favorites) is likely to persist, especially given the market's historical behavior.

However, prediction markets like Kalshi tend to revert to base rates and can be slow to fully price in long-term party disadvantage, especially when the next election is still years away and candidate fields are unsettled. Recent market pricing was only slightly in favor of Democrats (52-55%), but the news cycle and polling are negative for Democrats. The most likely scenario is a near-even market, but with a modest lean toward Republicans by late December 2025. Given how markets typically behave, I expect the Democratic contract to be slightly less favored on Kalshi during the last week of 2025, but not dramatically so.

The lack of clarity in both parties\u2019 candidate fields and the absence of a decisive event make a significant swing unlikely before the end of 2025. Furthermore, Kalshi\u2019s market structure and depth reduce the risk of arbitrary price manipulation, and the historical pattern is for Democrats to be slightly favored except in times of clear Republican momentum.
