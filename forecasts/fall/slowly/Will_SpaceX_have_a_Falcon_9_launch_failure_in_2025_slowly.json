However, the most recent failure was in 2024, suggesting the risk is not zero despite process maturity. SpaceX\u2019s cadence is increasing, with over 150 Falcon 9 launches expected in 2025 (123 through September, so likely 155\u2013160 total for the year). Even if the per-launch risk has dropped due to operational learning, the cumulative probability increases with frequent launches (e.g., 150 launches \u00d7 0.5% = 53% annual risk; even if risk is as low as 0.3%, that's ~36% annual risk). The absence of failures so far in 2025 could be due to luck or improved reliability, but with several months and dozens of launches left, the exposure remains high. While improvements likely mean the true per-launch risk is lower than historical average, aging hardware and the sheer number of launches mean the annual risk remains material. Bayesian updating\u2014giving some weight to zero failures in 2025 so far, but also to the 2024 failure\u2014yields a forecast close to, but not quite, even odds. Given all evidence, a probability in the 38\u201348% range is justified.

Given ~150 launches, even a per-launch failure rate of 0.3% (roughly historical) yields ~36% chance of at least one failure, but recent reliability and organizational learning probably keep it lower. However, the compounding effect of complexity and high cadence, plus historical precedent for at least one failure every few hundred launches, justify a slightly elevated risk compared to naive base rate calculations.
