Furthermore, Labour has a strong tradition of choosing sitting MPs, and the leadership rules are designed to insulate against outside candidacies. Given the current polling collapse and internal tensions, a leadership contest before 2029 is plausible, but the base rate for an outside-MP leader is essentially zero. Betting markets have consistently made Burnham an outsider, and the status quo bias is strong in party leadership transitions. In short, while Burnham\u2019s chances are higher than a true outsider\u2019s due to his persistent visibility and popularity, the barriers remain daunting.
