Burnham is able to secure a parliamentary seat via a by-election (perhaps in the North West, if a sitting MP steps down), overcomes NEC resistance, and leverages his popularity with the membership and public profile to win the instant-runoff vote among party members, especially if the alternative candidates split the vote or are seen as too closely tied to the Starmer era.",

The Median Voter Theorem suggests the party will select a candidate closest to the perceived electable centre: in the current context, that is likely to be a sitting MP with cross-factional appeal. Burnham's only plausible path requires an extreme scenario: a party crisis so deep that the institutional gatekeepers (NEC, MPs) are swept aside by member demand for a recognizable, left-leaning but electable leader. Even with Lucy Powell potentially joining the NEC, it is far from certain this bloc would be strong enough to clear the path for Burnham in the face of likely resistance. Historically, Labour has not chosen a leader who was not a sitting MP, and base rates for outsiders overcoming such hurdles are very low. Significant, credible reporting (Manchester Evening News, iNews, etc.) stresses the difficulty of Burnham's route, and even his closest allies are ambivalent about whether he will actually pursue it. My forecast therefore remains strongly weighted towards 'No', though I assign a small (but nonzero) probability to a Yes outcome due to Burnham's popularity and the possibility of extraordinary party upheaval.",
