            "no_scenario": "A 'No' outcome could result from a late-year financial or geopolitical shock: for example, a severe escalation in US-China trade war (e.g., imposition of new, high tariffs or retaliatory moves), a sudden and deepening banking crisis (possibly triggered by a major default or revelation of widespread loan fraud), or a sharp, unexpected policy move (such as significant tax increases or regulatory intervention in AI/tech). These would cause a rapid loss of investor confidence, a sell-off, and potentially push the index below its December 2024 close.",
            "yes_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome will occur if the status quo continues: the Federal Reserve proceeds with a rate cut or at least maintains a stable policy stance, government shutdowns are resolved or remain contained, trade tensions do not escalate beyond rhetoric, and no major geopolitical or policy shock emerges. Continued AI-driven optimism, broadening of the rally to other sectors, and resilience in the banking sector would all support a higher S&P 500 close at year-end.",
            "final_reasoning": "The S&P 500 is up over 13% year-to-date in mid-October, with recent news showing resilience in the face of minor banking sector stress and trade tensions. The Federal Reserve's dovish tilt supports risk assets, and political rhetoric has recently calmed market fears. History shows that double-digit gains at this stage are usually maintained unless a major exogenous shock occurs. While risks from regime uncertainty, trade, and credit remain, none appear systemically threatening at this point. Given the strong status quo bias, the high base rate of positive years, and robust recent market action, the probability that the S&P 500 closes 2025 above its 2024 close is very high.",
