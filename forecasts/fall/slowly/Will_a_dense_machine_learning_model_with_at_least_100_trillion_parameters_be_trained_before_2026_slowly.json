Understanding the practicalities and limitations of AI infrastructure\u2014such as GPU/TPU cluster scale-out, interconnect bottlenecks, job scheduling, and fault tolerance\u2014is crucial to evaluating whether such a model could realistically be trained and benchmarked in the remaining timeframe.",
