Known risks\u2014such as excess leverage, possible regulatory shocks, or a severe macro downturn\u2014are real but not currently signaled by on-chain panic. Historically, after major run-ups and shakeout corrections, BTC stays elevated absent a systemic shock (base rate: only 2 of last 8 years has BTC ended down YoY, and most bear years coincide with fraud/exchange failures or macro crisis). Given Bitcoin's resilience, the pro-crypto macro environment, and absence of systemic outflows, the probability of a 'Yes' is extremely high.

Structural factors\u2014regulatory clarity, spot ETF inflows, and growing treasury and retirement fund allocations\u2014represent demand that is sticky and not generally sensitive to short-term market pullbacks, distinguishing this cycle from 2021 and 2017. The current sharp correction, while notable, appears to be a typical leverage washout fueled by overheated sentiment at the highs, not the onset of a new macro or crypto-specific bear market; underlying trend, as reflected by consistent ETF/treasury inflows, remains positive. Macro environment is still benign to risk assets post-Fed rate cut. Absent a black swan regulatory or systemic shock (which would be required to breach the $93k level from here, given how deep and fast that would be), Bitcoin is highly likely to close above its 2025 opening price.

The uniquely favorable policy environment (GENIUS Act, pro-crypto executive orders, regulatory harmonization, ETF and DAT adoption) provides a powerful base for further adoption and demand. Market structure (leveraged unwind) and the possibility of a deeper risk-off phase present real but historically limited threats to giving up all YTD gains, unless a black-swan event occurs. Historical base rates after major run-ups in a strong regulatory regime overwhelmingly favor at least a flat-to-moderately-up finish. Thus, anything but a closing price above $93,429.20 would require an unusually severe and sustained downturn not currently evidenced by macro or regulatory trends.

While a sharp, sentiment-driven crash always remains a risk in crypto, the late-Q3 pullback is relatively mild in historical terms and may healthily reset the market. Most years with early-year strength and major regulatory advancements close positive, absent a catastrophic loss of trust or concerted global regulatory backlash.
