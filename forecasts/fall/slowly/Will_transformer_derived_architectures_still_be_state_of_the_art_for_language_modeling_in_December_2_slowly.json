Most new models are hybrids or incremental innovations that retain core transformer features and cite Vaswani et al. (2017). The resolution criteria only require two out of five top papers to be transformer-based; given current trends, it is highly probable this bar will be met. SSMs and other alternatives, while promising, are not yet mature or widely recognized as superior, and the ecosystem remains deeply invested in transformer infrastructure.

The definition of 'transformer-derived' is broad and includes hybrids and any architecture that cites Vaswani et al. or uses transformer submodules. The inertia from ecosystem lock-in, infrastructure, and expertise, as well as the timing (less than three months to the resolution date), makes a major displacement extremely unlikely. While the field is experimenting with alternatives (MoE, SSMs, Mamba), these are either not mature, not widely adopted, or implemented as hybrids, not clean breaks. Thus, the chance of two or more non-transformer-derived models topping the relevant Google Scholar search or the nlpprogress.com WikiText-2 benchmark is very low.
