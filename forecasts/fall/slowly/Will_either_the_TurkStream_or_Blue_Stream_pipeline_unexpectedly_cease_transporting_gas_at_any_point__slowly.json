The news shows a clear pattern of successful drone attacks on Russian oil pipelines and facilities, some of which have caused brief halts in operations. There have been several documented attempts to target TurkStream, with Russia publicly reporting the interception of drones aimed at compressor stations. The technical resilience of both pipelines, their subsea routing (for TurkStream), and enhanced security measures reduce the risk of a successful, impactful attack. Nonetheless, as these are now the only remaining pipeline routes for Russian gas to Europe, they are high-value, high-visibility targets. Even a brief, credible, unscheduled cessation of flow\u2014caused by sabotage or a rare technical event\u2014would resolve the question as Yes. Given the increased pace of drone and sabotage operations, the demonstrated reach and precision of Ukrainian attacks, and the high political stakes, I assess the risk in the final quarter of 2025 as meaningfully above the historical baseline. However, the technical and operational defenses, the rarity of successful attacks causing actual flow stoppages, and the geopolitical risks of escalation still mean that a No is somewhat more likely.

The past year has seen an unprecedented surge in successful long-range Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, with attacks now reaching deep into Russian territory and targeting facilities and pipelines with growing regularity. The TurkStream pipeline, in particular, is now the sole route for Russian gas exports to Europe, making it a high-value target. Russian defenses have to date proved adequate, but several near-miss incidents (including direct drone attacks on TurkStream compressor stations) suggest that the margin for error is shrinking. Blue Stream is somewhat less exposed due to lower European strategic importance but remains vital for Turkey and is also a potential target. Moreover, as a pipeline engineer, I note that while these pipelines are robust and have strong redundancy, no physical system is invulnerable to a sufficiently determined and capable adversary\u2014especially given demonstrated precedents (Nord Stream) and the operational complexity of underwater and cross-border pipelines. With three months left in a period of escalating attacks, I judge the risk as significantly elevated above historical norms but still not at parity, as successful, impactful attacks on gas pipelines remain technically harder than on oil pipelines and require both intent and opportunity. Weighing all factors, I assign a probability of 35% that either the TurkStream or Blue Stream pipeline will unexpectedly cease transporting gas at any point in 2025.",

The Turkish and Russian states have strong incentives to prevent and repair any damage quickly, and the pipelines\u2019 criticality means repairs are prioritized. The Blue Stream contract expiration at end-2025 is likely to be orderly and scheduled, barring last-minute breakdowns. Given the demonstrated intent and growing capability of Ukrainian strikes, plus the elevated risk of a successful (if brief) disruption, the chance of at least a short, unexpected cessation has risen.

            "no_scenario": "Despite ongoing drone and sabotage attacks, Russian and Turkish security measures successfully protect critical pipeline nodes. Any damage is limited to minor, quickly repaired facilities, or is foiled entirely. No unscheduled, non-maintenance interruption to gas flows on TurkStream or Blue Stream occurs before January 1, 2026. Even if contract negotiations for Blue Stream are tense, flows continue until expiry or any pause is scheduled and announced.",
            "yes_scenario": "A Ukrainian drone, sabotage, or cyberattack manages to inflict damage on a compressor, metering station, or pipeline section of TurkStream or Blue Stream, causing an unscheduled halt\u2014however brief\u2014in gas flows. Alternatively, an accident or technical failure unrelated to planned maintenance causes a surprise disruption, or an escalation in Russian-Ukrainian hostilities leads to a retaliatory strike or pre-emptive shutdown by one party. The interruption is confirmed by credible sources as unexpected, non-maintenance related, and not tied to contract expiration.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates for unscheduled, non-maintenance outages on TurkStream and Blue Stream are very low, and both pipelines have robust security and rapid response protocols. However, the risk environment has worsened: Ukraine is increasingly targeting energy infrastructure, including pipelines, and has already attempted to strike TurkStream infrastructure. While Russia and Turkey have strong incentives to protect these pipelines, the fact that they are now the last major gas conduits from Russia to Europe raises their profile as high-value targets. The Nord Stream sabotage demonstrates that unexpected events, though rare, are possible. Still, direct attacks that result in a halt of flows would likely trigger severe escalation and are thus not a preferred Ukrainian strategy given Turkey\u2019s neutral/mediator role. Most recent attacks (including those on the Druzhba pipeline) have caused only brief, quickly repaired disruptions, and TurkStream and Blue Stream have thus far been more resilient. Given all these factors, I assess the probability of either pipeline unexpectedly ceasing flows at any point in 2025 as higher than historical base rates, but still not likely\u2014risk is elevated but not extreme.",
