Existing rules and deterrents prove effective for the sport's most visible players.",

League or media monitoring detects the infraction, and a suspension (even for a single game) is announced before January 1, 2026.",
            "final_reasoning": "The probability that at least one All-Star will be banned or suspended for sports betting before the end of 2025 remains low but non-negligible. The primary reason is the extremely low historical base rate: despite the post-2018 explosion in legal wagering and numerous suspensions at lower levels, no All-Star has been implicated, suggesting strong personal, financial, and institutional deterrents. However, the ever-increasing normalization and saturation of betting (as evidenced by advertising numbers and NCAA policy relaxation) incrementally raise the risk that even a high-profile player could slip up. The broad All-Star definition (including reserves, injured, etc.) does expand the eligible pool, and the 'any suspension for any amount of time' criterion means even a minor incident would resolve the question 'Yes.' Still, the lack of current rumors or active investigations and the very short window until question resolution suggest that if such a high-profile scandal were brewing, some signals would likely already be present in sports media. While the risk is higher than in the pre-legalization era, it is not enough to justify a high probability. I estimate the true probability to be modestly above the base rate, reflecting the uptick in risk but respecting the status quo.",
