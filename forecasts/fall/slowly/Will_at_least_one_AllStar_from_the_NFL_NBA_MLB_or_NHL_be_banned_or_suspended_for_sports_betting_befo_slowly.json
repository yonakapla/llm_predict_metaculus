Lower-profile players might still be suspended, but All-Stars\u2014given their resources, awareness, and league scrutiny\u2014avoid infractions, or any ongoing investigations do not resolve before the deadline.",

This could result from increased surveillance, leaks, or a high-profile investigation concluding before the deadline, possibly triggered by the rising cultural acceptance of gambling or a slip-up amid the gambling ad saturation.",
            "final_reasoning": "The historical base rate is the most powerful argument against a Yes outcome: despite a surge in betting-related suspensions since 2018, no All-Star has been publicly suspended in the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL. The status quo is remarkably persistent, reflecting both league vigilance and the higher stakes for both players and organizations involved. However, the environment is changing rapidly: gambling ads are more pervasive, cultural acceptance is rising (as seen with the NCAA rule change), and violations are trending upward, especially among lower-profile players. The NFL, NBA, and MLB in particular have issued a flurry of suspensions for gambling, showing that detection and enforcement are real. All-Stars are not immune, but have more to lose, stronger education, and greater scrutiny. With only about 2.5 months left and no rumors or news of an impending All-Star suspension, the probability remains low, but the increasing volume of gambling activity and the unpredictable nature of leaks or investigations mean the risk is not negligible. I estimate the chance at 6%\u2014low, but not vanishingly so, reflecting both the weight of the status quo and the mounting pressure from the broader gambling culture.",
