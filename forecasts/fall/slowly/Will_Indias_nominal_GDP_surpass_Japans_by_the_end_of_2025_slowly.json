While the margin is razor thin\u2014meaning that currency volatility and data revisions could in principle flip the ranking\u2014there is no indication of a sharp yen rebound or INR crisis on the near-term horizon. GDP movements of these magnitudes are generally persistent if driven by fundamental real growth differentials, not one-off shocks; in addition, three major credit rating agencies have recently upgraded India. Geopolitical frictions exist but do not appear material enough to offset India's advantage in the next three months. Risks remain due to statistical and currency quirks, so a small but non-trivial chance of a No is retained, but base rates and trend momentum strongly support Yes.",

Given the strength of the base rates, corroborating projections, recent upgrades from credit agencies, and official claims already being made, I heavily weight the status quo and trajectory in favor of India retaining its new rank, but not fully discounting the small risk of reversal before the final January 2026 IMF numbers are published.",
