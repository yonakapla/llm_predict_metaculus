The recent uptick in monthly CPI (2.1% in September), persistent wage/price inertia, skepticism over official data, and mounting political risks (midterm elections, risk of policy reversal) all suggest that sustaining or further reducing inflation may prove very challenging. IMF and market-based forecasts remain above 30% for December 2025, and base rates for such rapid disinflation are low.

However, the margin is razor thin, and risks remain on both the upside (currency, political, or data reliability shocks) and downside (continued disinflation momentum, political incentives to present a 'victory' for Milei). As a central banking expert, I put extra weight on historical stickiness and the possibility of a late-year currency event, but also recognize the power of the current trend and the short time window for a reversal. The most likely outcome is a December 2025 YoY inflation figure between 28% and 32%, with a slight edge to it coming in just below 30%\u2014especially given the government's incentive to deliver a symbolic win and the technical feasibility if current trends hold.

However, the margin is narrow: September\u2019s 31.8% YoY is only slightly above the threshold, and recent months show a plateau or slight uptick (2.1% monthly in September). IMF and market forecasts have actually been raised in recent weeks (now 28-41%, with the IMF at 28% in one report and 41% in another; REM expects 30-35%). The most authoritative forecasts (IMF, REM) cluster just above or at the threshold, highlighting substantial uncertainty.\n\nPolitical risks are elevated: the October midterms could destabilize Milei\u2019s coalition, trigger policy reversals, or provoke market volatility. While US/IMF support has bought time, it is not a structural fix. Argentina\u2019s long-run base rate is for inflation to rebound or stabilize at higher levels after periods of austerity, especially if social or political backlash erodes reform momentum. That said, the current monthly inflation trend is very low; if it persists for three more months, the YoY figure could comfortably dip below 30%. The official nature of the resolution source (INDEC) means that even if real inflation is higher, the reported number is what matters.\n\nBalancing these factors, the probability is close to even odds but slightly favors a No, given the tendency for inflation to get stuck just above politically salient thresholds, the risk of pre/post-election instability, and the base rate of failed disinflation in Argentina. However, the chance of a Yes is not negligible\u2014if current trends hold, a 28-29% print is possible. Thus, I forecast No with moderate confidence, but not extremely so.",

Additionally, concerns about data credibility add downside risk. Public Choice theory highlights that governments facing declining support and rising unrest are strongly tempted to backtrack on painful reforms\u2014especially in the months immediately following elections, when the threat of future accountability is low but coalition maintenance is crucial. On the other hand, the combination of external anchors, still-high real interest rates, and the political cost to Milei of losing his anti-inflation credentials may help discipline behavior through year-end. The recent monthly inflation figures (~2%) are consistent with a December YoY number just below 30%, but only if there are no late-year shocks or policy slippage. Given these countervailing forces\u2014and weighting the base rate of failure more heavily due to Argentina\u2019s structural vulnerabilities\u2014I assign a probability slightly below even odds, but higher than most historical periods would justify.",

There is also a non-negligible risk that post-election instability or loss of confidence will nudge inflation back above 30%, though the government and external backers appear committed to maintaining the stabilization effort. The probability is therefore close to the threshold, with a slight lean toward a 'No' (i.e., YoY inflation remaining just above 30%) due to structural, political, and credibility constraints.
