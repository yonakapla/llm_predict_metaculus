Nominal GDP in USD terms for Germany stays above $5 trillion, while India's rises but remains below $4.2\u2013$4.3 trillion by end-2025. IMF, World Bank, and major financial outlets continue to list Germany as fourth, India as fifth. This is the expected and status quo scenario.",

Exchange rate swings further amplify the effect, narrowing and flipping the order. Major outlets and IMF confirm, before April 2026, that India\u2019s nominal GDP has surpassed Germany\u2019s for 2025. This scenario requires both extreme German weakness and Indian outperformance, which is unsupported by current data.",
            "final_reasoning": "All recent credible forecasts (IMF, World Bank, major news outlets as of November 2025) show Germany maintaining a significant lead in nominal GDP over India at the end of 2025. India\u2019s growth rate remains robust but was dampened in 2025 due to US tariffs and export headwinds, while Germany faced stagnation but not a collapse. The gap between Germany and India in 2024 was about $0.56 trillion; even with differential growth and some euro depreciation, India is not projected to close this gap by year-end. The IMF, Visual Capitalist, and The Indian Express all continue to show Germany in fourth place for 2025, with India in fifth and not overtaking until at least 2027\u20132029. No major new shock or revision has been reported that would overturn this. While there is always some nonzero chance of an unexpected GDP revision or currency crash, the base rate for such a rapid overtaking between large economies in a single year is extremely low. Therefore, the probability is very close to 0%.",
