However, multiple news articles, including Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, confirm fierce resistance in Congress, from US farmers, and even among some Republicans, to using the ESF or similar mechanisms for a politically charged bailout. The Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric is ambiguous: while Treasury Secretary Bessent announced readiness for a $20bn swap line, Trump later downplayed the prospect, suggesting support may be technical or symbolic. The swap line or loan would need to be not just announced but actually drawn on by the BCRA before year-end to resolve Yes. While the crisis remains acute, and there is a non-trivial chance of a last-minute intervention if the peso collapses or Milei\u2019s government is at risk of collapse, the political and procedural barriers are significant. The most likely scenario is continued ambiguity, with the US providing rhetorical, technical, or contingent support, and the IMF remaining the primary vehicle for financial assistance.

However, several significant headwinds remain: strong domestic political opposition (including from key Republican constituencies), the legal and institutional hurdles of using the ESF for Argentina, and the US preference for IMF-led operations. Furthermore, an announcement alone is insufficient; actual execution (disbursement or drawdown before 2026) is required for a Yes. The scenario is thus finely balanced: while the base rate of direct US bailouts is low, the confluence of political will, crisis severity, and recent public statements make a Yes outcome plausible, though not yet highly likely.

On the other hand, actual implementation has lagged rhetoric, and there is considerable domestic and Congressional opposition, with the ESF (Exchange Stabilization Fund) use being controversial. The swap line has not yet been drawn, and ambiguous official statements suggest a wait-and-see approach, perhaps until after Argentina\u2019s October 26 midterms. If instability spikes or Milei\u2019s party wins unexpectedly, the US could move quickly, but otherwise may delay, relying on IMF mechanisms or requiring further reforms.
