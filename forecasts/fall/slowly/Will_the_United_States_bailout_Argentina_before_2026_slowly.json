Political opposition is sharp in the US, and the Trump administration appears to prefer ambiguity and post-election timing, wary of domestic backlash. The most plausible path to a YES is a post-election crisis (late October/November) forcing the BCRA to draw on the US swap line or the US to intervene directly. However, unless the situation deteriorates dramatically, the base rate and political constraints argue against a large, explicit US bailout before end-2025.

The $20B swap line has been publicly discussed and markets have responded as if US backing is probable. Yet, actual disbursements or swap draws are not confirmed, and there is significant domestic political resistance, especially from US agricultural interests and Congress. Most news coverage frames the US support as a 'lifeline' or 'bridge' to the October election, not a long-term bailout. The timeline is extremely short (2.5 months), and the US may prefer to keep support symbolic or contingent unless a true financial panic forces its hand. On balance, I judge the probability of a direct US bailout (per the resolution criteria) before 2026 to be notably above base rate but still less than even odds, due to political and procedural hurdles, timing, and the preference for multilateral action.

Argentina\u2019s economic fragility and the risk of financial contagion create systemic incentives for action, which align with the liberal-institutional expectation that the U.S. will use available tools to stabilize a partner regime. However, as of mid-October, no qualifying action has been publicly executed, and significant U.S. domestic opposition (especially from agricultural lobbies and bipartisan critics) raises the political cost of a bailout, particularly via the ESF without congressional oversight. The Trump administration\u2019s preference for dramatic, headline-grabbing gestures could push toward action, especially if Argentina\u2019s crisis deepens after the October 26 elections or if Milei\u2019s government is seen as threatened. The window for action is short, and both the cost of waiting and the risk of acting increase as the year closes.
