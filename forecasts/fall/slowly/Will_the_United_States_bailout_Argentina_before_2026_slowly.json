On one hand, the Trump administration has made unusually public and explicit pledges of support, and Argentina's economic crisis is acute, making some form of intervention increasingly likely. The mechanisms (swap line, bond purchases, loan) are in place, and the US administration appears ideologically motivated to help Milei. On the other hand, strong domestic opposition, especially from agricultural interests and some in Congress, creates friction; there is also the historical tendency for the US to use multilateral channels like the IMF rather than direct bailouts. The fine print of the resolution requires not just announcements but actual execution (e.g., swap line drawdown, bond purchase, or direct loan). The status quo remains that, as of mid-October, no such action has been confirmed. However, the acute dollar shortage, Milei's political fragility, and the credibility invested by Trump and his Treasury Secretary in this rescue increase the likelihood that at least a portion of the announced support will be activated before year's end\u2014especially as a last-minute crisis response. My forecast therefore leans toward 'Yes', reflecting a high risk of intervention, but I moderate the extremity to account for implementation and political risks.",

The political cost and bipartisan resistance in the US, especially from farming constituencies and Congress, are substantial. The Trump administration appears to be hedging its public position, emphasizing 'help' but denying a formal bailout. However, the acute stress in Argentina, the precedent for late-stage US interventions, and the existence of technical instruments for rapid liquidity support mean that a formal bailout cannot be ruled out, especially if Argentina's situation deteriorates rapidly before year-end. Base rates for last-minute US bailouts of major regional economies are low but non-negligible in moments of acute crisis. Weighing the evidence, the probability of a formal US bailout meeting the resolution criteria before 2026 is above the base rate but still less than even odds. I assign a probability of 35%.",

However, several factors\u2014legal/institutional constraints, political backlash, and the US tradition of using the IMF as the main channel\u2014temper the probability.

The US may prefer to delay action until after Argentina\u2019s October 26 midterms, but if currency instability worsens, a draw on a US swap line or a direct intervention is plausible before year-end. Historically, the US has avoided such bailouts except in extraordinary circumstances (e.g., Mexico 1994). The circumstances today are extraordinary, but not yet at the 'systemic risk to US interests' level, and a bailout would be controversial and precedent-setting.
