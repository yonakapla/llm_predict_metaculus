The base rate for compelled oral testimony by unwilling, incarcerated felons in front of Congress is extremely low, especially within a short deadline and absent a negotiated deal. Maxwell's pursuit of clemency is real, but any such deal would require time and political capital that is lacking as the deadline nears. The only plausible path to 'Yes' is a dramatic, last-minute political deal or an unexpected change in Maxwell's legal calculus, neither of which is supported by current reporting. Thus, the probability is very low, but not absolute zero given the political volatility and the incentives for a dramatic reveal. A 5% probability is justified: low enough to reflect the base rate and all obstacles, but not zero due to theoretical possibility of a surprise deal or hearing.",
