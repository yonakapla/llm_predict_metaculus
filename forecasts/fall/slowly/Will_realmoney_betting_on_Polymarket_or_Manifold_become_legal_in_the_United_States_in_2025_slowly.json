While state-level legal battles persist, recent precedent from Kalshi (winning lawsuits in Nevada and New Jersey) suggests that federal regulatory approval can be sufficient to operate legally in at least some US states, even in the face of state opposition. Manifold appears almost certain not to become legal for real-money betting in 2025. Given the fine print requires only that real-money betting becomes legal in at least one state and that a public change in government policy (e.g., no-action letter) occurs, the conditions for a YES resolution are met. The only significant risk is last-minute regulatory reversal or successful state-level injunction before the end of 2025, but with Polymarket\u2019s relaunch imminent and ICE\u2019s institutional backing, the probability of such a reversal outweighing the federal approval is low.

While there remains state-level resistance, the question only requires legality in at least one state, and recent federal court victories by Kalshi in Nevada and New Jersey suggest that CFTC preemption is likely to allow Polymarket to operate in at least some jurisdictions. The fine print explicitly states that a CFTC no-action letter is sufficient, and multiple news sources confirm such an event has occurred. Barring a major, coordinated and immediately successful legal challenge that blocks all US operations before year-end (which is possible but not likely given timing and legal precedent), this should resolve YES.

The CFTC is the relevant federal regulator for event-based contracts, and Kalshi's continued operation despite state-level resistance demonstrates that federal licensing can supersede (at least in part) state gambling laws, satisfying the question's requirement that it be legal in at least one state. The ICE investment and institutional partnerships indicate thorough compliance vetting. Ongoing state litigation and regulatory controversy could limit the number of states where Polymarket can operate, but unless all states successfully block access (which, based on the Kalshi precedent, is unlikely), the 'Yes' criteria will be met. There is no evidence Manifold will offer real-money betting, but Polymarket alone suffices for a 'Yes' resolution. Ambiguities could arise if the CFTC no-action letter is reversed or if the contract types are so restricted that they don't qualify as 'real-money betting,' but as of the latest reporting, Polymarket's relaunch will meet the resolution criteria.

While state-level legal battles continue (especially for sports betting), the CFTC approval at the federal level is sufficient for legality in at least one state unless all states individually prohibit it, which is highly unlikely given Kalshi's continued operation. There is no evidence that Manifold is close to real-money legal status, but only one of the two platforms is needed for a YES. The main residual risk is a last-minute regulatory reversal or court injunction, but this is less likely given the public nature of the CFTC actions and Polymarket's preparations for relaunch.

These are classic 'public change in government policy' actions that meet the resolution criteria. The main obstacle is state-level pushback, but the question specifies that legality in just one state is sufficient and that a federal regulatory shift suffices if it allows operation. While some states are aggressively fighting federal preemption, legal precedent is mixed, and in practice, enforcement (and thus actual blocking) is uneven and often slow. Polymarket\u2019s public statements and major institutional investments (e.g., ICE) signal confidence in imminent US legality. Even if some states object, it is highly plausible that at least one state will not act to block Polymarket (or will not do so effectively before year-end), especially as Kalshi\u2014operating under similar federal auspices\u2014has succeeded in some states and courts. Manifold is unlikely to be relevant, as there is no evidence it will offer real-money betting in 2025. Overall, the base rate for prediction market legalizations is low, but the facts here represent a dramatic break from the status quo, with both regulatory and practical indicators strongly favoring a Yes outcome within the time window. The main risk is a last-minute legal injunction or universal state-level enforcement, but given the inertia and slow-moving nature of such processes, this risk is modest.

This launch is based on a clear, public change in regulatory policy at the federal level, satisfying the question's resolution criteria.",

The CFTC approval and the public nature of the regulatory change meet the question's fine print, assuming at least one state does not successfully block operation before year-end. While there are state-level legal challenges and continued risks of injunctions or technical delays, the base rate for regulatory inertia is overcome by the extraordinary institutional investment (ICE, NYSE), the explicit federal regulatory green light, and Polymarket's public plans to relaunch imminently. The main risk is a late-breaking state-level injunction or a technical/compliance delay preventing real-money trading from going live before 2026. Given the strong evidence of regulatory approval and the planned imminent launch, a bold forecast is warranted, albeit with some discount for state-level uncertainty and implementation risk. Manifold is unlikely to be relevant for Yes, so the outcome rests on Polymarket.",

This perspective is highly relevant because prediction markets sit at the intersection of finance, gambling, technology, and regulatory capture. Regulatory change often depends on the balance of concentrated opposition versus diffuse benefits, lobbying by incumbents, and the incentives facing regulators and legislators. I can assess the likelihood and durability of regulatory shifts, especially when powerful interests (e.g., casinos, state regulators) are threatened by innovative entrants like Polymarket and Manifold.",

No court or agency successfully blocks the relaunch before December 31, 2025. Manifold is less likely due to lack of reported regulatory progress, but a similar scenario could apply if it gains approval.",

The question's fine print requires a public change in law or policy (which is present), and only requires legality in one state\u2014not universal acceptance. While ongoing state-level lawsuits and political backlash present non-trivial legal risk, the base rate for federal regulatory reversals within months is very low. Manifold is unlikely to resolve the question itself, but Polymarket alone suffices. Unless a major, rapid legal reversal occurs before year-end, this is overwhelmingly likely to resolve Yes.
