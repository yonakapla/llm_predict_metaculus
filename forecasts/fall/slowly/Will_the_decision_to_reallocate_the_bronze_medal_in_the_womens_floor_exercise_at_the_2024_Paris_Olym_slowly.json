However, the Swiss court\u2019s remit is strictly limited to procedural violations, not to re-litigating the merits. There is no evidence as of today that the Tribunal is poised to act differently than in past cases, and the latest news (as of late November 2025) is that the decision is still pending, with no indication of imminent reversal. International sports governing bodies' preference for finality and the precedent of upholding CAS decisions are strong downward pressures. While the high-profile nature of the case, media advocacy, and allegations of racism introduce slightly more uncertainty, the best estimate\u2014using both base rates and the particulars of this case\u2014is that the probability of reversal before Jan 1, 2026, remains extremely low.",

The Chiles case, while garnering significant media and political attention and raising legitimate questions of procedural fairness and potential conflict of interest, presents no public evidence of such gross violations that would almost certainly trigger an annulment. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is narrow, and the passage of time without any indication of a favorable ruling further reduces the likelihood of a reversal before 2026. While the allegations are serious and public pressure is high, Swiss judicial precedent and the autonomy of sports arbitration suggest that overturning this decision is highly improbable absent overwhelming procedural misconduct. Given these factors, my well-calibrated probability is slightly above the absolute base rate, but still very low.",
