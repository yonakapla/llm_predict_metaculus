Recent downward revisions to jobs data, rising jobless claims, and a projected slowdown in GDP and hiring into late 2025 create powerful disinflationary momentum. Most published public and private forecasts (CBO: 3.1% annual average but decelerates into late 2025/2026) expect inflation to moderate, and base effects become more favorable in the year-on-year prints by late 2025.

Historically, after similar mild inflation surges, with central banks remaining vigilant and labor slack rising, inflation reverses, with only brief, rare exceptions. Current forward guidance, monetary/credit conditions, and the absence of new shocks point to stabilization or gentle decline.

Models from CBO and Moody\u2019s, projecting 3.1%\u20133.5% for 2025, suggest the consensus expects inflation to rise above (not below) current levels. Structural labor market weakness could exert strong downward pressure on inflation if slack proves larger than anticipated and rental markets crack quickly, but the mix of factors points to persistent goods/service inflation offsetting this, particularly given the policy environment of mild monetary easing and fiscal stimulus. The effect of base effects is less likely to help: since inflation ticked up during summer 2024, the YoY comparison for Nov 2025 will need outright monthly CPI declines by mid/late 2025 to push the 12-month change below 2.73%. BLS methodology amplifies this lagged effect. Given the outlook, it is most likely\u2014based on public forecasts, current YoY trajectory, and BLS construction\u2014that November 2025 CPI inflation will be equal to or higher than November 2024 (2.73%). A 'No' remains plausible; recession risk is elevated, and a shallow to moderate recession could see CPI fall.

These output gap signals typically dampen inflation with a short lag. Current monetary policy is turning more accommodative, but given lags, its inflationary impact is more material for 2026 than late 2025. Tariff passthrough, while not trivial, appears to be a level shift more than a sustained inflation impulse, per both recent PPI/CPI data and Fed guidance. Historical base rates indicate that inflation is more likely to fall after temporary externally driven spikes if demand weakens and the central bank does not overreact with excessive stimulus.

The key risk to a lower November 2025 inflation is the persistence of supply-side shocks (specifically, tariffs), but Fed and CBO commentary, along with the producer price data and consensus surveys, suggest that the largest impacts are likely one-off and are already cycling into base effects, making 12-month inflation more likely to subside in late 2025. Furthermore, the CBO and Moody\u2019s forecasts both expect a moderation or decline in inflation in 2026, which means November 2025 is sitting at the inflection point as these effects roll off. While new tariffs or a policy misstep could sustain inflation, base rate logic and the preponderance of disinflationary forces suggest the more probable outcome is a lower year-on-year CPI by November 2025. The recent uptick in inflation is likely a lagged effect of tariffs and pass-through, but weakening demand and base effects should drive the number lower year-over-year \u2014 in keeping with New Keynesian predictions when slack is rising.

Tariff and immigration policy appear to be pushing up prices, especially for goods. However, the labor market\u2019s pronounced weakness, job loss revisions, and recessionary risks should put strong downward pressure on inflation in the coming months. The Fed is responding but remains cautious\u2014some expectations anchoring is likely, yet monetary transmission lags. Most leading forecasts (Moody\u2019s, CBO) expect higher CPI for 2025 than 2024, projecting 3.1% annual inflation for 2025 (against 2.7% end-2024), and much of the market commentary expects lingering tariff effects to keep year-ahead inflation up. While producer price and business absorption may temper the spike, base effects work against a sub-2.73% print unless a pronounced deflation or recession manifests this autumn. Given recent inflation has surprised to the upside, consumer price stickiness, and the slow-moving nature of economic regime shifts, the probability that November 2025 CPI is below 2.73% strikes me as modest. My view\u2014grounded in the inflation expectations channel, which remains above target, policy uncertainty, and the clear upward trajectory in the data\u2014is that the probability of a 'Yes' is distinctly below even odds, but not extremely low, as the economic slowdown could still quickly translate into weaker prices.",
