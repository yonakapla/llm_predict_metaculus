The lack of transparency and Infantino's history of politicizing FIFA decisions further support a high probability. However, the risk of major backlash, ongoing U.S. Senate investigations, and FIFA's occasional responsiveness to reputational crises (particularly when under sustained Western scrutiny) temper the probability somewhat. Historically, FIFA has rarely given major honors to sitting political leaders, especially in such a nakedly political context, but the convergence of interests and current leadership's priorities make this a plausible break from precedent. The 'base rate' for such an event is exceedingly low, but the current context is highly abnormal.

Nonetheless, the absence of official confirmation, the risk of intense backlash (including a U.S. Senate investigation and negative international coverage), and FIFA's need to maintain some degree of legitimacy introduce uncertainty. There's a non-trivial chance that, in the final days, FIFA pivots to a less controversial recipient or shares the award among multiple figures to dilute controversy. On balance, however, given FIFA's track record of favoring power and expedient alliances over optics, and the extraordinary convergence of Trump\u2019s influence at this event, I judge the probability to be high, but not absolute.",

Alternatively, FIFA announces multiple recipients, none of whom are Trump, and frames the decision as being made by an independent panel.",

However, the convergence of factors\u2014Infantino's public and private alliance with Trump, the timing with the World Cup in the U.S., the Nobel snub, Trump's installation as Kennedy Center chair, and the complete opacity of the prize selection process\u2014strongly suggest the award may be intended as a symbolic gesture to Trump. At the same time, the risk of reputational blowback, ongoing U.S. Senate investigation, and negative press create substantial disincentives. However, the evidence points to a situation where the decision may already be locked in and the backlash is being managed rather than avoided (classic 'stealing thunder' and 'justification' strategies in crisis communication). Given the overwhelming circumstantial evidence, repeated leaks, Infantino's evasive answers, and multiple sources stating Trump is expected to win, I assess that the probability of Donald Trump being named as a recipient of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize is high\u2014though not absolute\u2014because FIFA could still pivot at the last minute if the backlash becomes unmanageable or if an internal negotiation leads to a compromise.

Alternatively, the prize is awarded to a group (e.g., 'frontline footballers'), or the announcement is deferred to avoid controversy.",

The ceremony is framed as a symbolic gesture of global unity and recognition for Trump's claimed peacemaking efforts. FIFA may attempt to mitigate backlash with carefully scripted messaging or by naming multiple winners, but Trump is specifically named among them.",

The risks (public backlash, Senate investigation, sponsor discomfort) are real and slightly temper the probability, but elite theory suggests such concerns are often secondary to the priorities and reciprocal obligations of dominant actors, especially in insulated transnational organizations like FIFA. The creation of the prize itself, the timing, and the orchestrated context all point toward a pre-arranged outcome. While not a certainty, the probability is substantially higher than base rates for such awards to political leaders, given these unique elite dynamics.",

Under pressure from global football stakeholders, sponsors, or as a concession to public criticism and the U.S. Senate investigation, Infantino and the selection committee opt for a less controversial recipient\u2014possibly a footballer with a charitable record, or a political figure with broader international appeal. Trump attends the event but is not named the Peace Prize winner.",
            "yes_scenario": "FIFA, prioritizing its alliance with Trump and the U.S. (the primary host of the 2026 World Cup), ignores or accepts the backlash and names Donald Trump as the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize winner. The award is presented as a gesture recognizing his role in 'uniting the world through football' or in facilitating peace negotiations (e.g. Middle East, Israel-Hamas ceasefire). The move is widely condemned but serves FIFA\u2019s short-term strategic interests.",
            "final_reasoning": "There is an unusually high level of circumstantial evidence pointing toward Trump as the likely recipient: the prize\u2019s creation coincides with his denied Nobel bid, the location and event are deeply intertwined with Trump\u2019s sphere of influence, and the public statements by Infantino and the lack of transparent selection criteria all point to an orchestrated outcome. The reputational risks are significant, as documented by critical press and a Senate probe, but FIFA has a long history of controversial decisions when the organization\u2019s leadership perceives a net benefit. The fact that the award is new, undefined, and not yet prestigious makes it easier to use as a political tool. While backlash could still cause a last-minute reversal, the balance of evidence\u2014especially the alignment of interests and the pattern of recent FIFA-Trump interactions\u2014suggests Trump is more likely than not to win. I would anchor the base rate of inaugural, politically tinged awards going to powerful allies at roughly 60%, but adjust slightly downward (to 55%) to account for the real, nontrivial risk of reputational blowback causing a late change.",
