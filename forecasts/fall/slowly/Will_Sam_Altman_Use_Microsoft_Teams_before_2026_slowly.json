However, the competitive friction and Altman's demonstrated willingness to use alternative platforms (e.g., Google Meet during the firing) decreases the likelihood that he would use Teams in a way that is publicized. The credible reporting requirement further decreases the probability, as even if usage occurs, it may not become public.

The main uncertainty is not if he has ever used Teams, but whether credible reporting or an official statement will confirm it before year-end. Given the very short time left, and the lack of any such reporting so far (despite the frequent media coverage of both Altman and OpenAI), the probability decreases.
