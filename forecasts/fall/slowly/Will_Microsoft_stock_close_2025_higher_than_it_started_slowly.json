Systematic shocks, sector-wide selloffs, or an abrupt change in regulatory/accounting environment are low-probability over this short time horizon, especially absent a pattern of negative surprises. The Efficient Market Hypothesis tells us that most of the exuberant AI/tech/soft-landing case is priced in, so extreme upside is less likely, but history is on the side of a positive outcome over the next three months in a non-recessionary context.
