Only a minority of analysts seriously contend with a repeat of 2024's outlier figure. Overvaluation signals are flashing, and affordability barriers are nearing their limit for most local buyers\u2014leaving growth heavily reliant on international capital and upper-income demand, which, while still strong, faces new regulatory headwinds. The current annualized rate (14%) is already robust, and a further acceleration large enough to breach 18% by year-end would require either a major Q4 demand shock or unexpected macro/financial events. Given all factors\u2014especially land supply inertia, drag from prior price run-ups, and global macro stability\u2014I assess the chance of >18% growth as materially lower than for a 10\u201315% advance, but not impossible given supply stress.

Structural supply shortages in Madrid are severe and worsening, with deficits now among the deepest in Spain and no meaningful policy or planning mitigation in place. Foreign demand is exceptionally strong and gaining share, especially from non-resident, higher-paying buyers. While these factors argue firmly for ongoing price inflation, strong countervailing forces exist: affordability is approaching limits for domestic buyers, macroeconomic worries are mounting (Spain\u2019s inflation outpaces Eurozone, ECB rate cuts on hold), and most expert forecasts (CaixaBank, Tinsa, Fotocasa) point to 5\u201310% growth, with optimistic cases as high as 10\u201312% (though a minority of analysts mention the possibility of higher spikes in in-demand cities).\n\nAfter a 20% YoY increase in 2024, the historical base rate and path dependence argue against another consecutive 18%+ surge\u2014such sustained doubling is extremely rare outside crash-bubble cycles. Even optimistic institutional models rarely forecast above 14% for 2025. Therefore, despite the powerful upward pressures, the probability of >18% is meaningfully less than 50%. A major unexpected demand shock or investor frenzy would be needed; more likely are strong but decelerating gains (10\u201315%). I expect <18% increase, barring a last-quarter global/local demand shock.\n\nFinal probability: 20% for >18% YoY increase in Madrid 2025, as the prior surge and structural shortages keep risks high, but base rates, expert forecasts, and affordability squeeze all favor strong-but-not-extreme growth.",
