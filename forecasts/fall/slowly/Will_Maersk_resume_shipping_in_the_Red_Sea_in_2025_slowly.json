Maersk\u2019s corporate risk management, shaped by ISO31000 principles, dictates a low tolerance for foreseeable, high-probability catastrophic risks, especially when alternatives (Cape of Good Hope routing) exist, even at higher cost. While some shipping activity has returned, this is not led by global majors like Maersk and is not a signal of industry-wide normalization. The diplomatic process in Gaza is ongoing but has not yet produced the concrete, stable conditions required for Maersk to change course.

Insurance and P&I markets remain highly restrictive, and the international naval presence, while significant, is insufficient to guarantee safety. Political talks around Gaza could, in theory, reduce Houthi attacks, but as of now, the Houthis remain active and effective. Maersk's public statements have been cautious, and the company has a strong safety culture and legal obligations under UNCLOS to protect crew and vessels. While a partial or test resumption could technically satisfy the resolution criteria, the likelihood remains low given persistent risk factors, the slow-moving nature of status quo change, and industry precedent.

Maersk, as a risk-averse, ISPS-compliant, and insurance-dependent operator, is extremely unlikely to resume Red Sea transits under these conditions. The company would require several months of demonstrated stability, effective military protection at scale, and clear signals from both insurance markets and flag states that the risk is manageable. With less than 3 months remaining in 2025 and the most recent attacks occurring in late September and early October, there is not enough time for this to happen. Base rates for shipping resumption after such threats suggest a much slower return, and Maersk\u2019s own public statements have been pessimistic about 2025. The only plausible Yes scenario would be a sudden, dramatic cessation of attacks tied to a rapid diplomatic breakthrough and immediate, verified change in Houthi behavior, which currently appears unlikely.

I am also attuned to how base rates of shipping interruption, de-escalation patterns, and the efficacy of international naval operations affect risk assessments for resuming commercial shipping.",
            "status_quo": "As of October 2025, Maersk has not officially resumed shipping in the Red Sea. Attacks on merchant vessels by the Houthis continue, albeit episodically, and Maersk\u2019s policy remains one of indefinite suspension, with rerouting via the Cape of Good Hope.",

Attacks on commercial shipping have resumed since mid-2025, including deadly attacks and the sinking of vessels, with the Houthi leadership reaffirming their willingness to strike any ship linked (even tenuously) to Israel. This unpredictability makes it difficult for Maersk to assess risk as manageable."

EU Operation Aspides and US-led task forces have provided protection to hundreds of vessels, but their resources are stretched thin, and several attacks have occurred despite their presence. The extension of these operations into 2026 shows commitment, but their inability to stop attacks entirely limits their deterrent effect."

There are ongoing peace efforts (Trump's plan, indirect talks, humanitarian flotillas), but the Houthis continue to tie their attacks directly to the status of Gaza. Even with some de-escalation in Gaza, the Houthis have signaled willingness to reactivate attacks at Hamas\u2019s request, and recent upticks suggest the linkage remains strong."

Even partial resumption would require a clear, sustained reduction in risk, which current conditions do not provide.

If a Gaza ceasefire or major regional agreement is struck and holds, the Houthis might reduce attacks rapidly, and Maersk might partially resume shipping before the end of 2025. However, this window is closing as 2025 draws to a close and peace talks remain fragile."

            "no_scenario": "The Houthis continue episodic attacks on Red Sea shipping, with several vessels damaged, sunk, or detained in late 2025. International naval escorts, while robust, remain insufficient for comprehensive security. Maersk maintains its suspension policy through December 2025, citing ongoing risk. No credible announcement of resumption is made, and no official change in Maersk's policy is evident before January 1, 2026.",
            "yes_scenario": "A breakthrough in Gaza political negotiations leads to a durable ceasefire and explicit commitments from the Houthis to halt attacks on Red Sea shipping. Alternatively, a significant surge in international escort operations and a demonstrable multi-week period without attacks convince Maersk to announce a partial resumption of Red Sea transits, even if only for certain lanes or under heavy escort, before the end of 2025.",
            "final_reasoning": "The situation in the Red Sea remains highly volatile. Despite some periods of reduced attacks, the Houthis have resumed targeting commercial shipping with deadly force as recently as September\u2013October 2025, including the sinking of ships and casualties among crews. Their public statements link the continuation of attacks directly to the status of Gaza, and they have shown the ability to rapidly escalate. International protection operations have not eliminated the risk, and Maersk, as a leading global shipper, is extremely sensitive to risk, insurance costs, and reputational damage. There is no public indication that Maersk has altered its policy or is preparing to do so imminently, and the CEO\u2019s past statements set a very high bar for resumption. The base rate for resumption after such crises is low, especially with less than three months left in 2025. While a peace breakthrough could change the calculus, there is no evidence that such a breakthrough is imminent or that the Houthis would promptly halt attacks and allow Maersk to act before year-end. Therefore, the probability of Maersk officially resuming Red Sea shipping in 2025 is low.",
