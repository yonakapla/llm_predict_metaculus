The recent news shows ongoing, even escalating, Houthi attacks\u2014including the disabling of a Dutch merchant vessel and continued missile/drone attacks on Israel and Red Sea shipping. Despite international naval efforts, the number of ships attacked and the intensity of violence (including deaths and hostage-taking) have not meaningfully abated. Maersk's risk posture is historically conservative; there is no indication from public statements or market moves that it is preparing to resume, and insurance markets remain extremely wary. Even if some improvement occurs (e.g., a Gaza ceasefire), there is little time left in 2025 to demonstrate a sustained reduction in risk sufficient for Maersk to change its policy. The fine print allows for partial or conditional resumption, but with only ~3 months to go, the combination of persistent threat, insurance obstacles, and Maersk's risk aversion make resumption unlikely. Therefore, my initial forecast is strongly negative but not absolute, accounting for a slim chance of a rapid positive geopolitical breakthrough.",

The Security Dilemma dynamic\u2014where defensive measures (naval presence, retaliatory strikes) provoke further Houthi escalation\u2014remains unresolved.

Looking at Somali piracy (2008\u20132013), resumption of normal shipping by major lines only occurred once attacks dramatically fell and robust international naval patrolling (with direct offensive action) was in place.

With Iran under renewed sanctions and increased pressure, the incentive to project power through the Red Sea and maintain leverage remains high.

            "no_scenario": "Despite ongoing peace talks for Gaza, Houthi attacks continue intermittently through Q4 2025, with several high-profile incidents (including at least one involving a Western-owned vessel). Maersk maintains its suspension, citing unacceptable risk and lack of adequate naval protection. Insurance premiums remain exorbitant, and no official announcement or credible reporting emerges of Maersk ships resuming Red Sea passages before the end of 2025.",
            "yes_scenario": "A breakthrough in Gaza\u2014e.g., a durable ceasefire and significant easing of the blockade\u2014leads to a public Houthi announcement of a moratorium on Red Sea attacks. This is corroborated by a rapid and sustained decline in attack frequency (zero or near-zero incidents for 6+ weeks), and insurance markets respond positively. Maersk, seeking to regain market share, announces a partial resumption of Red Sea activity (e.g., limited convoys with naval escort, or a pilot run), or credible sources report Maersk vessels transiting the Red Sea under new protocols.",
            "final_reasoning": "The status quo remains deeply unfavorable to Maersk resuming Red Sea operations in 2025. The past quarter has seen a significant escalation in Houthi attacks (multiple ships attacked/sunk, crew killed or taken hostage, including non-Israeli-linked vessels), and there is no evidence of a sustained reduction in threat or a major change in Houthi or Iranian posture. Naval protection is present but not comprehensive, and coverage gaps persist. The base rate for resumption in comparable crises (e.g., Somali piracy) suggests that shipping giants require a significant, sustained improvement in security and insurance conditions, neither of which are present. Maersk's own statements and the current insurance environment reinforce their risk aversion. While ongoing Gaza talks could theoretically shift the situation, the linkage between Houthi attacks and Gaza remains strong, and any peace remains tentative. The most likely scenario is continued suspension by Maersk through the end of 2025, absent a dramatic, near-term de-escalation that is not currently visible in the news or diplomatic trajectory.",
