Despite some increase in Red Sea volume by smaller or regional carriers, the risk environment remains hostile: several recent, deadly attacks, with no sustained downward trend in threat level. International naval efforts have proven insufficient, and political progress on Gaza remains tentative and highly reversible. The window for a policy reversal is now very short (less than three months), and there is no explicit signal from Maersk or the industry that a change is imminent. The only caveat is the relatively low bar for 'partial resumption' under the resolution criteria, but even a minimal return seems unlikely absent a dramatic, near-term security improvement or political breakthrough.

While there is some progress on international naval operations and diplomatic engagement, coverage and deterrence remain inadequate for a company as risk-sensitive as Maersk, especially given insurance constraints and the high-profile nature of recent attacks. The Houthis continue to declare their intent to attack any vessel linked to Israel and have broadened their interpretation of what constitutes such a link, increasing the ambiguity and risk for all operators. Diplomatic efforts toward a Gaza settlement are ongoing but have not yet produced a durable reduction in hostilities or a Houthi ceasefire. The base rate for rapid resumption of shipping in high-threat environments is low unless there is a clear and sustained period of security, which is not currently in evidence.

While there is some diplomatic movement (Trump plan, possible ceasefire), there is no evidence yet of a durable security improvement in the maritime domain.

Maersk\u2019s risk posture is conservative and highly influenced by legal, insurance, and reputational concerns.

Maersk, under pressure to restore efficient shipping lanes and with strong guarantees from naval coalitions, announces a limited resumption\u2014perhaps a single pilot convoy or select shipments\u2014before year-end. This is accompanied by public statements and credible shipping data showing Maersk vessels passing through the Red Sea.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for rapid resumption of high-risk commercial shipping after a year of persistent, deadly attacks is low. All recent news (October 2025) points to an environment of ongoing escalation: attacks are continuing, including deadly and high-profile incidents; the Houthis remain capable and motivated, and their threat is expanding to a broader set of targets. International naval operations have failed to provide comprehensive security. Maersk, as an industry leader, is extremely cautious and has signaled no intention to resume before clear, sustained safety improvements\u2014none of which are evident. Insurance constraints and reputational risk remain decisive negative factors. Although the question allows for partial resumption to resolve Yes, there is no evidence Maersk is preparing even a token passage. Given all these factors, the probability Maersk resumes shipping in the Red Sea in 2025 is very low, and the status quo is highly likely to persist through year-end.",

The naval protection is insufficient for a company like Maersk to confidently resume operations at scale, especially given the limited number of escort ships and persistent gaps in coverage. This decreases the probability."

Their CEO has publicly stated they do not expect resumption until 'well into 2025.' With ongoing attacks and recent deadly incidents, Maersk is unlikely to be the first mover back into the region absent a clear, durable improvement. This further decreases the probability."

While peace talks are ongoing (Trump plan, negotiations in Cairo), there is no signed, implemented, and stable ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that would satisfy Houthi demands. Furthermore, the Houthis have signaled willingness to escalate if their demands are unmet, and their actions are partly driven by Iranian regional strategy, not just Gaza. As such, there is a strong possibility attacks will continue or even escalate through the end of 2025. This decreases the probability."

Maersk, with global brand and shareholder considerations, is likely to wait until both the threat and insurance premiums drop significantly. This status quo on insurance and rerouting increases the likelihood Maersk will stay out."

Maersk could, in theory, resume limited, heavily escorted Red Sea transits for select cargo or as part of a test run. However, there is no evidence of such moves in the latest news\u2014indeed, recent deadly attacks (October 2025) would make any such move appear reckless. This slightly increases the probability from zero but does not outweigh the strong negative factors."

            "no_scenario": "The ongoing Houthi threat remains acute, with continued missile, drone, and boat attacks on commercial vessels, some resulting in deaths and the loss of ships. International naval protection is stretched thin and cannot guarantee safety. Negotiations for Gaza stall or fail to produce durable peace, and the Houthis maintain their campaign. Maersk leadership, seeing little improvement, keeps its suspension in place through the end of 2025, with no announcement or partial resumption.",
            "yes_scenario": "A significant and durable ceasefire is reached between Israel and Hamas, leading to a substantial and sustained drop in Houthi attacks (either through direct orders from Tehran or as a result of internal Houthi calculus). International naval escorts are reinforced, and insurance markets respond by lowering premiums. Maersk, seeking to test the waters, announces a partial or trial resumption of Red Sea transits late in 2025, or credible reports emerge of Maersk ships transiting the region under new policy.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates for a quick resumption of shipping after major regional threats are low\u2014historically, shippers wait for robust, sustained improvements before resuming high-value traffic in conflict zones. The news flow shows that as of October 2025, Houthi attacks have actually intensified, with advanced weaponry and deadly outcomes. International protection remains inadequate, and insurance is still prohibitively expensive. Maersk has a track record of caution, and there are no signals of imminent policy change. The only path to a Yes is a sudden political breakthrough (ceasefire implementation, sharp drop in attacks, and a rapid Maersk announcement), but this is highly unlikely within the remaining 2.5 months. Thus, the probability of Maersk resuming shipping in the Red Sea in 2025 is very low\u2014higher than absolute zero due to the possibility of a partial/symbolic resumption, but still extremely unlikely given the persistent violence and risk environment.",
