The Mag 7 are not as unprofitable or speculative as dot-com names, but the market is pricing in extraordinary future earnings. Rotation into other AI names and the fact that the Mag 7 are not moving in perfect lockstep lowers the risk of four or more falling >50% together. Some like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet have strong enough fundamentals to avoid such a drawdown absent an extreme shock. Still, the macro backdrop is fragile: bond market stress, global slowdown risks, and policy shocks could precipitate a correction. Given recent historical performance, current levels of profit growth, and the early warning signals (but not yet panic), I judge the probability of a 'bubble pop' as defined here before Jan 2026 is meaningfully elevated versus the status quo, but not the most likely outcome.
