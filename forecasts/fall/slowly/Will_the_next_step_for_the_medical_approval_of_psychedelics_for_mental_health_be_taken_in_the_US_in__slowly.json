However, there are strong countervailing forces: a new FDA Commissioner with a mandate to speed up reviews, political pressure from both parties and veterans groups, and explicit moves to relax review standards. Multiple companies have INDs and are trial-ready. The question's resolution requires only a filing (not acceptance/approval) or DEA rescheduling, both of which are more achievable than approval. Given the closing window in Q4 and the lack thus far of a public NDA/EUA filing or DEA rescheduling, but with visible momentum and multiple shots on goal, I judge the probability to be higher than the historical base rate but still well below even odds.

The historical base rate for new NDA/EUA filings for psychedelics is low, but the convergence of political, regulatory, and social factors makes a 2025 filing or rescheduling plausible, especially via EUA or administrative rescheduling rather than traditional NDA. The main obstacles are regulatory caution over data quality and trial methodology, and the typical duration of late-stage trials, but political will may override the usual conservatism, at least to the extent of a filing (not an approval). Recent FDA rejection of MDMA for PTSD is a negative, but transparency and political pressure could trigger a new, faster filing for an alternative indication (e.g., GAD), or a symbolic rescheduling.

There is clear industry momentum\u2014companies like Arcadia are advancing novel MDMA analogs and have investor backing. The threshold for resolution does not require the NDA/EUA to be accepted or approved, just filed, which lowers the bar. On the other hand, the base rate of NDA/EUA submissions for psychedelics is very low, and clinical data gaps remain (as highlighted in multiple articles and the recent FDA CRL). Political will may outpace the science, but the regulatory process still takes time, and there is no public news of a filing in the pipeline for 2025. Nevertheless, the confluence of political pressure, public advocacy (especially by veterans), industry incentives, and the new FDA/HHS leadership make it plausible that at least one company will file an NDA or EUA for a psychedelic in the last quarter of 2025, even if the data are marginal.

The Arcadia Medicine IND clearance for a novel MDMA analog for GAD is a potential wildcard, but an IND is not an NDA, and the news suggests trials will only initiate in 2025, with NDA filing unlikely before 2026 barring exceptional circumstances.

The FDA\u2019s recent rejection of MDMA signals a high evidentiary bar; however, the new administration is sending unusually strong pro-psychedelic signals and pledges to speed up reviews. The DEA could theoretically act independently to reschedule, especially with administrative backing, but this remains historically unlikely without FDA input or a strong external push. The most plausible path to a Yes is a politically-driven DEA rescheduling (which could happen quickly, especially if framed as a response to veteran advocacy or administrative priorities) or a surprise NDA/EUA filing by a company aiming to capitalize on the new climate, even without full trial maturity (since filing, not acceptance, is required). While the base rate for such filings/reschedulings in any given year is extremely low, the confluence of a favorable political environment and visible industry momentum nudges the probability upward. Given the very short time window left in 2025, the lack of any announcement of an imminent filing, and the recent regulatory caution, I estimate the probability at 22%.",
