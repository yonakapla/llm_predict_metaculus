While most major trials are unlikely to yield data packages sufficient for a robust NDA/EUA by year-end, the lowered filing bar and political context make at least one attempt plausible. Also, the DEA may act more quickly than in previous years if pressured. Weighing the base rate (very low\u2014no such filing ever in history until now) against these unique 2025 dynamics, the probability is well above historical trend but not yet above 50%, given the time left and institutional inertia.

There is strong, bipartisan political support and advocacy, especially from veterans, and the FDA has already lowered the bar for review timelines and trial requirements. While clinical trial timelines usually make NDA filings unlikely within such a short window, the explicit resolution criteria only require a filing or rescheduling, not approval. Multiple news reports confirm Arcadia\u2019s IND clearance and intent to begin trials, but an NDA/EUA in 2025 is still a stretch unless the FDA or DEA acts on political direction. Given the explicit interest in accelerating progress, the possibility of at least one regulatory filing or rescheduling in 2025 is plausible. I therefore assign a moderately high probability\u2014higher than the base rate, but not extreme because of remaining scientific, legal, and bureaucratic hurdles.",

            "no_scenario": "Despite political and advocacy momentum, no company files an NDA or EUA for a psychedelic for a DSM-5 mental disorder before the end of 2025, due to insufficient or inconclusive clinical data, ongoing regulatory caution, and the time needed to address FDA's concerns from the 2024 MDMA rejection. The DEA, meanwhile, does not act quickly enough to reschedule any psychedelic given its slow, evidence-driven process and lack of a formal petition with compelling new data.",
            "yes_scenario": "A psychedelic company (likely MAPS/Lykos for MDMA, Compass Pathways for psilocybin, or MindMed for LSD) files a new NDA or EUA for a DSM-5 mental health indication, spurred by political encouragement and/or partial new data. Alternatively, the DEA\u2014under political pressure and with new leadership\u2014initiates and completes a rescheduling action for MDMA or psilocybin within 2025, possibly under a narrower schedule for research or clinical settings.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for NDA or EUA filings for psychedelics for mental health in the US is zero, but the current environment is highly unusual: there is significant political pressure, regulatory movement, and advocacy, and the bar is only 'filing,' not 'acceptance.' The FDA's August 2024 rejection of MDMA was a major setback, but the agency is now under new leadership with explicit signals of openness, and the Trump/RFK Jr. administration seems willing to expedite or revisit these applications. The DEA remains a bottleneck, but administrative pressure could spur action. Importantly, recent news (Oct 2025) shows Arcadia Medicine secured FDA clearance for an IND (not an NDA) for a patented form of MDMA for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, indicating active progress. However, this is only an IND\u2014an NDA would require positive trial results, which is unlikely by year-end given trial timelines. The news does not indicate any NDA filings yet, and the clinical trial pipeline appears months away from NDA/EUA maturity. Thus, while the political context is more favorable than ever, procedural and data barriers remain. My expert assessment is that there is a non-negligible chance (given the political pressure and lowered bar for 'filing'), but less likely than not, that the next step (filing an NDA/EUA or federal rescheduling) will be taken before January 1, 2026.",
