            "no_scenario": "Despite political enthusiasm and ongoing research, no sponsor submits an NDA or EUA for a psychedelic for a DSM-5 mental health disorder before January 1, 2026. DEA does not reschedule any classic psychedelic, either due to lack of compelling new data, bureaucratic inertia, or internal regulatory caution. Ongoing clinical trials (e.g., COMPASS Pathways, Arcadia Medicine) do not reach the stage of NDA/EUA submission in time. Policy shifts are discussed but not implemented rapidly enough. The FDA's recent rejections and demand for new trials slow down sponsors.",
            "yes_scenario": "A sponsor (e.g., Arcadia Medicine, COMPASS Pathways, MAPS) files an NDA or EUA for a psychedelic (MDMA, psilocybin, etc.) for a DSM-5 mental health indication by the end of 2025, possibly galvanized by new FDA/DEA leadership and political support. Alternatively, the DEA, under political pressure or as part of a new federal initiative, reschedules a psychedelic (e.g., MDMA or psilocybin) to Schedule II or lower before January 1, 2026, independent of FDA drug approval. The filing or rescheduling occurs even if approval is not granted.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for NDA/EUA filings or federal rescheduling for psychedelics for mental health is extremely low, with no recent successful precedents. The FDA\u2019s August 2024 rejection of MDMA for PTSD underscores the agency\u2019s continued demands for strong, durable, and methodologically sound efficacy and safety evidence. Ongoing trials (e.g., COMPASS Pathways' psilocybin, Arcadia Medicine's new MDMA analog) are probably not far enough along to support an NDA/EUA filing in 2025, and the recent IND clearance for AM-1002 is a necessary but not sufficient step. However, there is clear evidence of a political shift: new FDA and HHS leadership appear eager to accelerate psychedelic approvals, and high-level public statements from RFK Jr. and Trump allies could pressure agencies to move quickly. The DEA could, in theory, reschedule a psychedelic via administrative processes, but this remains rare and usually requires a strong scientific consensus. Ultimately, the inertia of the US regulatory process, the aftermath of a high-profile FDA rejection, and the continued need for new clinical data all weigh heavily against a Yes resolution. Still, the window remains ajar due to political will and pipeline activity. Given all these factors, I assign a probability of 25%, leaning heavily toward No but allowing a non-trivial chance for an expedited filing or rescheduling driven by political intervention.",
