Burnham cannot stand until re-elected as an MP, and other challengers are not yet mobilizing. Unless a dramatic scandal or catastrophic electoral result occurs very soon, Starmer is likely to remain leader whenever the next leadership election is eventually triggered. Therefore, the probability that Keir Starmer himself wins the next leadership election (i.e., the next time there is a formal contest for Labour leader) is very high, either because he is re-elected unopposed or because no contest occurs for years.

The PLP is largely composed of Starmer loyalists, the NEC is still under his influence, and no credible challenger with sufficient support has emerged. Andy Burnham, often floated as a potential rival, is not an MP and would face significant procedural hurdles to contesting. The deputy leadership contest could foment instability, but is more likely to serve as a pressure release than a trigger for a leadership election. The party is risk-averse after a long period out of government, and would be wary of internal civil war absent a total electoral collapse. Therefore, the probability that Keir Starmer wins the next Labour leadership election (if one is held) is very high, but the probability that such an election occurs in the near future is low.

The risk of a leadership election is elevated, but not yet at the point where it can be considered likely in the immediate future. If a contest is triggered, Starmer\u2019s incumbency, party machinery, and lack of a viable alternative all give him an edge. Most scenarios where a contest is triggered in the next 12-18 months would likely still see Starmer on the ballot and, unless a shock candidate emerges, winning\u2014though not with overwhelming support.

The party's own rules and the inertia of incumbency work powerfully in his favor. The base rate for a leader who has recently delivered a general election victory being ousted within 18-24 months is very low.

The PLP and NEC remain largely loyal, and the nomination rules are a high bar for challengers. Key would-be challengers like Andy Burnham are currently ineligible. Even with factional rumblings, no broad, credible coalition against Starmer has emerged, and recent contests (such as the deputy leadership) demonstrate that his allies can outmaneuver rivals. If a leadership election were called in the near term, Starmer would almost certainly win, as his support network remains dense and central within the party hierarchy. Only a catastrophic collapse\u2014well beyond current polling\u2014would likely shift this equilibrium.
