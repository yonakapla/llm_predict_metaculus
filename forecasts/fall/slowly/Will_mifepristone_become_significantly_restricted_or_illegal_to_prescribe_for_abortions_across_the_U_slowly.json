The FDA review, while politically charged, is unlikely to result in an evidence-based ban or restriction given decades of safety data, unless political interference overrides scientific judgment in a manner that withstands legal challenge in the very short remaining timeline. The biggest wildcard is a court-ordered emergency injunction, but recent legal history and current case status suggest this is unlikely to be both issued and survive through the end of 2025.

FDA, state-led efforts) seek to restrict mifepristone, and some have survived motions to dismiss, but no court has imposed a nationwide ban. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2024 decision was procedural, not substantive, leaving open the possibility of standing for state-led challenges. However, the time required for litigation and appeals makes a pre-2026 nationwide effect unlikely."

The Project 2025 agenda and renewed interest in enforcing the Comstock Act raise the theoretical risk of executive action or reinterpretation that could restrict mailing or prescribing mifepristone.

            "no_scenario": "Despite lawsuits, political pressure, and administrative reviews, mifepristone remains FDA-approved and available for abortion in at least some states. State-level bans persist, but no nationwide court ruling, federal law, or FDA order takes effect before January 1, 2026. The ongoing lawsuits (e.g., Missouri v. FDA) are not resolved or are stayed on appeal, and federal agencies do not enact emergency restrictions. The Comstock Act is not newly enforced or is tied up in further litigation. Shield-state telehealth providers continue to serve patients in permissive jurisdictions.",
            "yes_scenario": "A federal court (e.g., in Missouri v. FDA or a related case) issues an injunction or ruling that immediately and nationwide revokes FDA approval or imposes severe restrictions (e.g., reinstating pre-2016 REMS, banning telemedicine, or requiring in-person dispensing everywhere), and this order is not stayed on appeal before January 1, 2026. Alternatively, the FDA or HHS, under extreme political pressure, issues an emergency order or rule\u2014effective nationwide before 2026\u2014restricting or suspending mifepristone\u2019s abortion indication. Or, the federal government invokes the Comstock Act and successfully blocks mailing and prescription of mifepristone for abortion in all states, with the action taking effect pre-2026 and not immediately blocked by court order.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for nationwide bans or major restrictions on FDA-approved, evidence-based medications is extremely low, especially in the absence of clear congressional action or overwhelming scientific controversy. The recent approval of a second generic by the FDA (October 2025) demonstrates regulatory continuity and resistance to abrupt policy reversals. All major legal and regulatory moves to date have either failed (Supreme Court standing decision) or remain mired in litigation unlikely to resolve and take effect nationwide before the end of 2025. While political and legal threats\u2014including Project 2025 and Comstock Act enforcement\u2014exist and could materialize under a new administration in 2026, the short timeline and procedural requirements make a pre-2026 nationwide ban or significant restriction implausible. The only plausible path would be a surprise court injunction or emergency administrative action, both of which would likely be stayed or delayed by appeals, especially given the high-profile nature of the issue and the FDA\u2019s current stance. Therefore, the probability of mifepristone becoming significantly restricted or illegal to prescribe for abortions across the entire US before 2026 remains very low, with the status quo overwhelmingly likely to persist.",
