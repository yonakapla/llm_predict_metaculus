GiveWell, in response, updates its models, rapidly de-lists deworming charities, and does not allocate 10% or more of its discretionary grants to deworming in 2025. Alternatively, operational disruptions (e.g., political bans, program shutdowns) force GiveWell to remove all deworming partners.",

No news from the past few months suggests a major pivot; modeling and global health articles still reference deworming as a viable, cost-effective intervention. GiveWell\u2019s cautious, evidence-driven approach means changes are typically telegraphed well in advance, and there is no signal of an imminent deworming exit. While ongoing debates about evidence quality persist, GiveWell\u2019s transparency and discounting approach mean they are unlikely to drop all deworming recommendations absent a dramatic evidence shift. The probability is somewhat less than 100% to reflect the possibility of late-breaking evidence or an unforeseen operational crisis, but remains very high.",

No news articles indicate a sudden evidence collapse or sector-wide policy reversal. The base rate for GiveWell making abrupt programmatic pivots is very low; when changes occur, they are gradual and pre-announced, and there is no signal of such a shift underway. Deworming charities remain logistically viable and cost-effective by GiveWell\u2019s modeling, and the status quo in global health policy continues to endorse mass deworming in endemic regions. While GiveWell is always attentive to evidence, the threshold for removal is high, and programmatic/donor inertia further raises the bar.
