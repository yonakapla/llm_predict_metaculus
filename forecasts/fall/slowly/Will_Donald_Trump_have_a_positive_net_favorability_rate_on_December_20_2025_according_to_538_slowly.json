The news articles strongly reinforce that Trump's current trajectory is negative, with approval/favorability in the high 30s to mid-40s and disapproval in the mid-50s. While question wording can slightly increase favorability compared to approval, and a black swan event could theoretically boost his ratings, there is no plausible evidence for such a reversal in the next 2.5 months.
