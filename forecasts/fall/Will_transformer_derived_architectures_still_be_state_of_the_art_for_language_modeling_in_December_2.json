The rise of hybrids and the SSM ecosystem's immaturity further support ongoing, if transitional, dominance of transformer approaches through December 2025. The resolution criteria are generous in classifying hybrids and any architecture citing Vaswani et al. as transformer-derived, leaving little room for a decisive break within two months. Therefore, I judge the probability that transformer-derived architectures will still be state of the art for language modeling in December 2025 to be 76% (implying a 24% chance of a disruptive non-transformer SOTA).",

The presence of multiple high-profile hybrid and SSM models in recent news signals genuine architectural ferment. Although I maintain that transformers or their derivatives are highly likely to meet the resolution criteria, I acknowledge a slightly higher downside risk over the next 2-3 months than previously argued.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe transformer architecture was introduced in the landmark 2017 machine learning paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Previously, many researchers believed that the attention mechanism was among the most promising research directions for improving sequence-to-sequence models. Writing in 2015, Christopher Olah [remarked](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/),\n\n> LSTMs were a big step in what we can accomplish with RNNs. It\u2019s natural to wonder: is there another big step? A common opinion among researchers is: \u201cYes! There is a next step and it\u2019s attention!\u201d\n\nThis prediction turned out to be correct. Transformers are generally considered to have unseated LSTM at competitive language modeling, and their central operating principle is using the attention mechanism.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":4892,\"question_id\":4892}}`",

It begins with the 2017 paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et\u202fal., which introduced the transformer architecture that replaced RNNs with self\u2011attention, enabling efficient long\u2011range context capture. The narrative then follows OpenAI\u2019s GPT series: GPT\u20111 (2018) introduced a two\u2011stage pre\u2011training/fine\u2011tuning pipeline; GPT\u20112 (2019) scaled to 1.5\u202fB parameters and demonstrated zero\u2011shot learning; GPT\u20113 (2020) reached 175\u202fB parameters and added instruction tuning via InstructGPT and RLHF. The 2020 paper on Scaling Laws formalized the relationship between model size, data, and compute, showing that larger models are more sample\u2011efficient.\n\nThe article discusses DeepMind\u2019s Chinchilla (2022), which proved that a 70\u202fB\u2011parameter model trained on more data outperforms larger models such as Gopher (280\u202fB) and Megatron (530\u202fB), recommending a 20:1 tokens\u2011to\u2011parameters ratio. Google\u2019s PaLM (540\u202fB parameters) leveraged the Pathways system for distributed training, while OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT (built on GPT\u20113.5) became the fastest\u2011growing consumer app, marking a shift from open research to commercial deployment.\n\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA series (7\u202fB\u201365\u202fB) introduced data\u2011efficient training and architectural tweaks like rotary embeddings and Grouped Query Attention (GQA). Anthropic\u2019s Claude 2 expanded the context window to 100\u202fK tokens, enhancing long\u2011form reasoning. Mixtral, a French MoE model, activated only 8\u202fB parameters during inference, reducing memory usage. Google\u2019s Gemini added multimodal reasoning, and GPT\u20114 (2023) brought multimodality, improved reasoning, and stronger RLHF alignment, powering ChatGPT Plus and enterprise solutions.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Sora (2024) pushed beyond text with a diffusion\u2011based text\u2011to\u2011video model capable of generating 60\u2011second videos. Meta\u2019s LLaMA\u202f3 (2024) matched GPT\u20114 performance, trained on ~4\u202ftrillion tokens. The 2025 DeepSeek\u2011r1 family emphasized step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning traces and RL\u2011based chain\u2011of\u2011thought alignment, achieving self\u2011correcting behavior. The author notes other notable models (Qwen, Kimi, Grok) and that Kimi has trained a 1\u202fT\u2011parameter model. The blog concludes with a casual sign\u2011off, reflecting its informal tone.\n\nKey metrics cited: 1.5\u202fB parameters (GPT\u20112), 175\u202fB (GPT\u20113), 70\u202fB (Chinchilla), 540\u202fB (PaLM), 100\u202fK\u2011token context (Claude\u202f2), 4\u202ftrillion tokens (LLaMA\u202f3). The narrative remains factual and explanatory, with no overt bias.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 01:48 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@axry/a-brief-history-of-generative-ai-e4fe02a37502)\n\n**From Transformers to Agentic AI: A Timeline of Innovation**\nThe article traces the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence from the 2017 breakthrough paper 'Attention Is All You Need' to the present day. It notes that the Transformer architecture, introduced by Google researchers in 2017, eliminated recurrence and convolutions in favor of attention mechanisms, enabling faster and more scalable models. This innovation set new standards in machine translation and laid the groundwork for modern large language models (LLMs) and the emerging field of agentic AI. The timeline highlights key milestones, emphasizing how each step has brought us closer to intelligent, collaborative, and adaptive AI systems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 11:32 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@saidrassai/from-transformers-to-agentic-ai-a-timeline-of-innovation-70794c333b2c)\n\n**MoE vs SSM: Two Paths out of the 'Square Tyranny' of Transformers**\nThe article explains that the transformer\u2019s attention mechanism, with quadratic complexity O(n\u00b2), creates a computational wall it calls \u2018\u0422\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u2019. It describes the problem using the metaphor of a corporate archaeologist who can only analyse one message at a time because the attention window is too small. The author then presents two architectural alternatives that break this wall. First, Mixture\u2011of\u2011Experts (MoE) uses a router to send each token to a handful of specialised experts, reducing per\u2011token compute while allowing the total knowledge capacity to grow to trillions of parameters. However, MoE still requires loading all experts into GPU memory, leading to huge VRAM demands and complex load\u2011balancing. Second, State\u2011Space Models (SSM) process sequences with linear complexity O(n), storing past information in a continuous state. This eliminates quadratic cost and enables long\u2011range context, but as of September\u202f2025 the SSM ecosystem is still immature compared to transformers. The article cites the Mamba architecture as a recent breakthrough in SSM, and notes that by September\u202f2025 both MoE and SSM models have become mainstream. It concludes that the future of AI lies in hybrid systems that combine the strengths of both approaches, rather than relying on a single monolithic transformer.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/articles/949826/)\n\n**14 AI Algorithms You Should Know**\nThe article outlines fourteen AI algorithms, describing their principles, typical use cases, and key characteristics. It begins with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), noting that for more than two classes they are applied pairwise and that a penalty factor can be added for misclassified points, creating a 'soft margin'. It then explains Decision Trees (DTs) as non\u2011parametric supervised learners for classification and regression, highlighting their interpretability but also their tendency to overfit. Random Forest is described as an ensemble of random DTs that aggregates votes or averages probabilities, a form of 'bagging'. XGBoost is presented as a scalable gradient\u2011boosting system that starts with a single tree and iteratively adds trees based on residuals. K\u2011means clustering is introduced as an unsupervised method that partitions observations into k clusters by minimizing within\u2011cluster variance, with Lloyd\u2019s algorithm as the most common heuristic. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is described as a statistical technique that transforms correlated variables into orthogonal, uncorrelated components via eigen\u2011decomposition or singular\u2011value decomposition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are noted for their position\u2011invariant feature extraction in computer vision, using convolutional layers that slide over images and compute dot products. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are explained as feed\u2011forward networks with feedback loops that allow them to model sequences, though they suffer from 'vanishing gradients'. Long Short\u2011Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced as a variant that mitigates this problem with gating mechanisms. Transformers are highlighted as architectures that rely solely on attention mechanisms, enabling them to process long\u2011range dependencies without recurrence or convolution. Finally, Q\u2011learning is described as a model\u2011free, value\u2011based reinforcement\u2011learning algorithm that seeks the optimal action sequence, often combined with neural networks for tasks such as video\u2011game playing or robotics. The article concludes by noting that these algorithms form the foundation of many modern AI applications.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 05:40 AM\nSource:[CIO](https://www.cio.de/article/4061494/14-ki-algorithmen-die-sie-kennen-sollten-2.html)\n\n**The Anatomy of a Transformer Part 1: Building the Encoder**\nThe article explains how the Transformer architecture, introduced in the 2017 paper titled 'Attention Is All You Need', addresses three core problems of language modeling: context, order, and scale.

It begins with the 2017 paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et\u202fal., which introduced the transformer architecture that replaced RNNs with self\u2011attention, enabling efficient long\u2011range context capture. The narrative then follows OpenAI\u2019s GPT series: GPT\u20111 (2018) introduced a two\u2011stage pre\u2011training/fine\u2011tuning pipeline; GPT\u20112 (2019) scaled to 1.5\u202fB parameters and demonstrated zero\u2011shot learning; GPT\u20113 (2020) reached 175\u202fB parameters and added instruction tuning via InstructGPT and RLHF. The 2020 paper on Scaling Laws formalized the relationship between model size, data, and compute, showing that larger models are more sample\u2011efficient.\n\nThe article discusses DeepMind\u2019s Chinchilla (2022), which proved that a 70\u202fB\u2011parameter model trained on more data outperforms larger models such as Gopher (280\u202fB) and Megatron (530\u202fB), recommending a 20:1 tokens\u2011to\u2011parameters ratio. Google\u2019s PaLM (540\u202fB parameters) leveraged the Pathways system for distributed training, while OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT (built on GPT\u20113.5) became the fastest\u2011growing consumer app, marking a shift from open research to commercial deployment.\n\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA series (7\u202fB\u201365\u202fB) introduced data\u2011efficient training and architectural tweaks like rotary embeddings and Grouped Query Attention (GQA). Anthropic\u2019s Claude 2 expanded the context window to 100\u202fK tokens, enhancing long\u2011form reasoning. Mixtral, a French MoE model, activated only 8\u202fB parameters during inference, reducing memory usage. Google\u2019s Gemini added multimodal reasoning, and GPT\u20114 (2023) brought multimodality, improved reasoning, and stronger RLHF alignment, powering ChatGPT Plus and enterprise solutions.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Sora (2024) pushed beyond text with a diffusion\u2011based text\u2011to\u2011video model capable of generating 60\u2011second videos. Meta\u2019s LLaMA\u202f3 (2024) matched GPT\u20114 performance, trained on ~4\u202ftrillion tokens. The 2025 DeepSeek\u2011r1 family emphasized step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning traces and RL\u2011based chain\u2011of\u2011thought alignment, achieving self\u2011correcting behavior. The author notes other notable models (Qwen, Kimi, Grok) and that Kimi has trained a 1\u202fT\u2011parameter model. The blog concludes with a casual sign\u2011off, reflecting its informal tone.\n\nKey metrics cited: 1.5\u202fB parameters (GPT\u20112), 175\u202fB (GPT\u20113), 70\u202fB (Chinchilla), 540\u202fB (PaLM), 100\u202fK\u2011token context (Claude\u202f2), 4\u202ftrillion tokens (LLaMA\u202f3).

It notes that the Transformer architecture, introduced by Google researchers in 2017, eliminated recurrence and convolutions in favor of attention mechanisms, enabling faster and more scalable models. This innovation set new standards in machine translation and laid the groundwork for modern large language models (LLMs) and the emerging field of agentic AI. The timeline highlights key milestones, emphasizing how each step has brought us closer to intelligent, collaborative, and adaptive AI systems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 11:32 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@saidrassai/from-transformers-to-agentic-ai-a-timeline-of-innovation-70794c333b2c)\n\n**Qwen3\u2011Next: Alibaba\u2019s LLM Reaches a New Level**\nAlibaba\u2019s Qwen3\u2011Next, released on 10\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, is a 80\u2011billion\u2011parameter language model that uses only 3\u202fbillion active parameters per inference. The architecture blends a hybrid attention mechanism\u201475\u202f% of the layers use linear attention (Gated DeltaNet) to cut memory and compute costs, while the rest use standard attention\u2014making it no longer a pure transformer. It also adopts a slimmed\u2011down mixture\u2011of\u2011experts (MoE) design: 512 experts are available, but only ten are active at a time, so each token prediction requires just 3\u202fbillion parameters. Training optimisations include a zero\u2011centred RMS\u2011norm to replace the exploding QK\u2011norm, a new MoE\u2011data\u2011feeding routine, and speculative decoding for multi\u2011token inference. According to the Qwen team, these changes allow the model to be trained with only 80\u202f% of the effort needed for the smaller Qwen3\u201130B\u2011A3B, and less than 10\u202f% of the effort of the dense Qwen3\u201132B. In inference, the model is noticeably faster on long contexts. Deployment is limited by incompatibility with llama.cpp; it works with the Transformers library, vLLM, and Apple\u2019s MLX framework. Quantisation is essential: the model needs >160\u202fGB RAM unquantised, so AWQ or similar techniques are used. Performance figures: ~20\u202ftokens/s on an RTX\u202f6000\u202fPro with AWQ, ~50\u202ftokens/s on an M2\u202fUltra 4\u2011bit, and ~150\u202ftokens/s via OpenRouter. The Qwen3\u2011Next\u2011Instruct variant is only marginally better on reasoning tasks and is highly restrictive on political queries, often refusing to answer. The article presents these technical details factually, with no overt bias or sensationalism.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 08:59 AM\nSource:[heise online](https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Alibabas-LLM-Qwen3-auf-dem-naechsten-Level-10669987.html)\n\n**MoE vs SSM: Two Paths out of the 'Square Tyranny' of Transformers**\nThe article explains that the transformer\u2019s attention mechanism, with quadratic complexity O(n\u00b2), creates a computational wall it calls \u2018\u0422\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u2019. It describes the problem using the metaphor of a corporate archaeologist who can only analyse one message at a time because the attention window is too small. The author then presents two architectural alternatives that break this wall. First, Mixture\u2011of\u2011Experts (MoE) uses a router to send each token to a handful of specialised experts, reducing per\u2011token compute while allowing the total knowledge capacity to grow to trillions of parameters. However, MoE still requires loading all experts into GPU memory, leading to huge VRAM demands and complex load\u2011balancing. Second, State\u2011Space Models (SSM) process sequences with linear complexity O(n), storing past information in a continuous state. This eliminates quadratic cost and enables long\u2011range context, but as of September\u202f2025 the SSM ecosystem is still immature compared to transformers. The article cites the Mamba architecture as a recent breakthrough in SSM, and notes that by September\u202f2025 both MoE and SSM models have become mainstream. It concludes that the future of AI lies in hybrid systems that combine the strengths of both approaches, rather than relying on a single monolithic transformer.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/articles/949826/)\n\n**14 AI Algorithms You Should Know**\nThe article outlines fourteen AI algorithms, describing their principles, typical use cases, and key characteristics. It begins with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), noting that for more than two classes they are applied pairwise and that a penalty factor can be added for misclassified points, creating a 'soft margin'. It then explains Decision Trees (DTs) as non\u2011parametric supervised learners for classification and regression, highlighting their interpretability but also their tendency to overfit. Random Forest is described as an ensemble of random DTs that aggregates votes or averages probabilities, a form of 'bagging'. XGBoost is presented as a scalable gradient\u2011boosting system that starts with a single tree and iteratively adds trees based on residuals. K\u2011means clustering is introduced as an unsupervised method that partitions observations into k clusters by minimizing within\u2011cluster variance, with Lloyd\u2019s algorithm as the most common heuristic. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is described as a statistical technique that transforms correlated variables into orthogonal, uncorrelated components via eigen\u2011decomposition or singular\u2011value decomposition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are noted for their position\u2011invariant feature extraction in computer vision, using convolutional layers that slide over images and compute dot products. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are explained as feed\u2011forward networks with feedback loops that allow them to model sequences, though they suffer from 'vanishing gradients'. Long Short\u2011Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced as a variant that mitigates this problem with gating mechanisms. Transformers are highlighted as architectures that rely solely on attention mechanisms, enabling them to process long\u2011range dependencies without recurrence or convolution. Finally, Q\u2011learning is described as a model\u2011free, value\u2011based reinforcement\u2011learning algorithm that seeks the optimal action sequence, often combined with neural networks for tasks such as video\u2011game playing or robotics. The article concludes by noting that these algorithms form the foundation of many modern AI applications.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 05:40 AM\nSource:[CIO](https://www.cio.de/article/4061494/14-ki-algorithmen-die-sie-kennen-sollten-2.html)\n\n**ZeroToGPT: A comprehensive guide to train Custom GPT from scratch on 7B tokens for free.**\nThe article presents a step\u2011by\u2011step guide to building a custom GPT\u2011style language model from scratch, using a 12\u2011layer decoder with 8 attention heads and training it on a 0.5\u202fB\u2011token dataset from Hugging\u202fFace.

The training pipeline is described: tokenization with an OpenAI tokenizer, memory\u2011mapped NumPy arrays for efficient batch loading, GPU\u2011accelerated data transfer with pinning and asynchronous copy, and mixed\u2011precision training with gradient scaling and clipping. Hyper\u2011parameters such as batch size, learning rate schedule (warmup + cosine decay), gradient accumulation, and optimizer (AdamW) are outlined.

The training loop is detailed, including loss computation, evaluation frequency, and text\u2011generation sampling after each epoch. The guide concludes with practical tips for device selection, seed setting, and parameter counting.

The confusion matrix shows class\u2011wise accuracies of 99.5\u202f% for Agricultural Crops (AC), 99.375\u202f% for Forest (F) and 99.667\u202f% for Highway (HV), with only a handful of mis\u2011classifications. Varying the learning rate demonstrated that lower rates improve performance, reaching 99.50\u202f% accuracy at 0.0001. Training required 700 iterations and 10 epochs; the average inference time per run was 678.91\u202fs (range 600\u2013750\u202fs).

It begins by noting that earlier models such as RNNs and LSTMs processed text sequentially, which limited their ability to capture long\u2011range dependencies. In 2017, the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' introduced the Transformer, which uses scaled dot\u2011product attention to directly relate every token in a sequence, enabling parallel processing and greater accuracy. The piece then walks through the core components of a Transformer: token embeddings, positional encodings, multi\u2011head self\u2011attention, feed\u2011forward layers, residual connections, and layer normalisation. A step\u2011by\u2011step example shows how to build a miniature encoder, train it on a toy counting task, and observe that the model learns to predict the next number in a sequence. The article emphasises that full\u2011scale Transformers require massive data and compute, so developers typically rely on pre\u2011trained models from Hugging Face. It lists common downstream tasks\u2014sentiment analysis, summarisation, translation\u2014and highlights the speed, efficiency and versatility of newer generations of models.

It outlines how sequence\u2011to\u2011sequence tasks were traditionally handled by RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, and how the new attention mechanism, introduced in 2015, allowed models to focus on different parts of an input sequence. The Transformer eliminates the step\u2011by\u2011step processing of RNNs, enabling full\u2011sequence parallel computation. The summary details the encoder\u2011decoder structure: input embeddings, positional encoding (using sinusoidal functions), self\u2011attention with query, key, and value vectors, multi\u2011head attention, residual connections, layer normalization, and a feed\u2011forward network.

It begins with the 1950s\u20111980s era of expert systems that used manually written IF\u2011THEN rules, citing the 1970s medical system MYCIN as a landmark example. It then describes the 1980s\u20112000s machine\u2011learning era, where algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, SVMs, and k\u2011NN learned patterns directly from data, enabling applications in banking, e\u2011commerce, and spam filtering. The next phase, shallow neural networks, introduced simple ANN architectures with one hidden layer, which could model non\u2011linear relationships but were limited by computing power and data availability. The article explains how the 2010s saw a resurgence of deep learning, with multi\u2011layer CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and GANs achieving breakthroughs in computer vision, speech, and generative tasks, thanks to abundant data and GPU acceleration. Finally, it highlights the 2017 paper *'Attention Is All You Need'* by Vaswani et\u202fal., which introduced the transformer architecture.

Its key contributions are: (1) a fully attention\u2011based architecture that eliminates the need for RNNs or CNNs; (2) parallelization of token processing, which significantly reduces training time; and (3) the ability to capture long\u2011range dependencies through attention. These features enabled the development of large\u2011scale models such as BERT, GPT, T5, and RoBERTa, which now dominate natural language processing. The architecture is also applied in computer vision (Vision Transformers), generative AI, scientific research, and speech processing. Practical deployment is facilitated by libraries such as Hugging Face, which provide pre\u2011trained models (e.g., 'bert\u2011base\u2011uncased') that can be loaded with a few lines of code. For custom tasks, PyTorch offers a transformer layer that can be fine\u2011tuned or trained from scratch.

They were first introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' and have since become the foundation for nearly every state-of-the-art natural language processing model. The Transformer architecture addresses the limitations of older architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) by processing the entire sequence simultaneously through its attention mechanism. This allows every token to directly access information from every other token in the sequence, regardless of distance. The Transformer's design has two major benefits: it can model relationships over any distance in the sequence and it can capture complex dependencies and hierarchical structures in language. The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, with each layer containing an attention mechanism and a feed-forward block. The attention mechanism determines how much focus each token should give to every other token when forming its representation, while the feed-forward block provides non-linear transformation capacity. The Transformer's ability to process all tokens in parallel, combined with its flexibility and accuracy, explains why it has become the standard for almost all modern NLP systems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 12, 2025 08:41 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@vijaiyananda/transformers-unpacked-a-laymans-guide-to-how-they-work-580e1c65ef2b)\n\n**Decoding Transformers Model**\nThe Transformers model has significantly impacted the field of deep learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and sequence modeling.

This shift from time-dependent to simultaneous computation is the foundation of Transformer scalability, making them capable of tackling tasks unimaginable with sequential models.

The architecture works by taking input data and generating output through a series of steps, although the article does not provide a detailed explanation of these steps.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 23, 2025 02:11 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/double-pointer/understanding-transformer-architecture-the-engine-behind-modern-llms-cffd4349ee43)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert domains\u2014spanning machine learning engineering, NLP system design, deep learning, and science and technology studies\u2014there is a strong consensus that transformer-derived architectures are very likely to remain state of the art (SOTA) for language modeling as of December 2025. The forecasts universally cite the entrenched dominance of transformers and hybrids in both published research and industrial applications, with recent leading models (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini, Qwen3, Mixtral, DeepSeek) all being transformer-based or clear derivatives. The principal factors supporting continued dominance include significant ecosystem lock-in (libraries, hardware optimization, pre-trained models), SOTA reporting practices favoring transformer citation, and historical base rates showing slow paradigm displacement. While alternatives, especially state-space models (SSMs, e.g., Mamba) and hybrids incorporating SSM/MoE components, are increasing in prominence and media hype, most remain at the 'hybrid' or 'immature' stage, still citing or utilizing transformer mechanisms. The resolution criteria\u2014requiring at least two of the top five SOTA papers from 2025 or the NLPProgress WikiText-2 benchmark to describe transformer-derived models\u2014set a relatively low bar for a positive (yes) outcome, especially given that hybrids or any models substantially citing Vaswani et al. (2017) still qualify as transformer-derived. Experts note that true architectural paradigm shifts, even with visible technical advances, tend to lag substantially due to publication/reporting delays and deep path dependence. While the probability assigned varies (with a small number leaning as low as 24\u201335% if focusing on disruptive potential or the nascent rise of hybrids/SSMs), the majority assignment lies in the 70\u201385% range, with a median final probability above 70%. Thus, it is very likely\u2014though not absolutely certain\u2014that transformer-derived architectures will still be considered SOTA in language modeling by December 2025, with any major transition to alternatives expected to mature and be recognized in the field only after that point.",
