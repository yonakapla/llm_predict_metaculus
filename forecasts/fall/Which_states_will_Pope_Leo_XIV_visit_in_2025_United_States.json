The structural inertia of Rome during a Jubilee (plus all recent papal travel patterns) isn\u2019t going to yield because the U.S. occupies a big part of Catholic imagination\u2014or polling statistics. No matter how hearty the drumbeat of American civil-religious pride, there's zero evidence the Vatican is prepping for anything stateside, and the Catholic Church doesn't pivot on nationalist pride when scheduling state visits.

Yes, American Catholics are numerous, but numbers alone have never dictated first-year travel, nor are they a proxy trigger in the absence of a major event or crisis. In short: you give a demographic tailwind to a scenario that is fundamentally dead in the water due to total signal silence from both Rome and the USCCB.

Acutis, born in 1991 in London and raised in Milan, died in 2006 at age 15 from acute leukemia. He is known as the \u2018ciberap\u00f3stol\u2019 or \u2018geek de Dios\u2019 for using computers to spread the word of God, documenting more than 130 Eucharistic miracles and creating evangelisation websites. His beatification in 2020 and the recognition of two miracles \u2013 the cure of a Brazilian child with pancreatic disease and the recovery of a Costa Rican student from a coma \u2013 led to his canonisation. He is interred in a glass reliquary at Santa Maria la Mayor in Assisi, where thousands of pilgrims visit annually. Frassati, who died 4 July 1925 at age 24, was a Dominican layman active in charity, the Catholic Action and the St. Vincent de Paul Society. He was beatified 20 May 1990 by Pope John Paul II and is called the \u2018hombre de las Bienaventuranzas\u2019, patron of youth, students, athletes and Catholic youth groups. In 2024 Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to Frassati, opening the path to canonisation. The ceremony was originally scheduled for 3 August 2025 to coincide with the Youth Jubilee but was postponed after Pope Francis\u2019s death in April 2025. The article cites the dates 1991, 2006, 2018, 2020, 2024, 2025, 4 July 1925, and 20 May 1990, and the figure 130 miracles. Quotes from the text include \u2018ciberap\u00f3stol\u2019, \u2018geek de Dios\u2019, \u2018hombre de las Bienaventuranzas\u2019, and \u2018santo millennial\u2019.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 04:52 PM\nSource:[Mi Diario](https://www.midiario.com/mundo/leon-xiv-eleva-a-los-altares-a-carlo-acutis-y-pier-giorgio-frassati/)\n\n**Vatican Hosts First LGBTQ+ Pilgrimage Under Pope Leo XIV**\nA thousand LGBT Catholics marched from the Jesuit church of Jes\u00fas to the Vatican, covering 130 km, marking the first gay pilgrimage in the official Jubilee calendar, which occurs every 25 years. The pilgrimage passed through the Santa Gate of St. Peter's Basilica during the 2025 Holy Year. The mass was presided over by the vice\u2011president of the Italian Episcopal Conference. The pilgrims noted that the Catholic Catechism still labels homosexual acts as 'intr\u00ednsecamente desordenados', yet they see the path as long. Pope Francis had previously advocated an inclusive church, calling for 'todos, todos, todos' and opening blessings for same\u2011sex couples in late 2023, provoking backlash in conservative regions such as Africa. Pope Leo XIV, the new pontiff, has not yet spoken on the issue but reportedly aligns with Francis\u2019s stance. When he was a cardinal, he echoed Francis\u2019s call for a more inclusive church, saying 'dej\u00f3 muy claro que no quiere que las personas sean excluidas simplemente por las decisiones que toman, ya sea de estilo de vida, trabajo o lo que sea'. On Thursday, Leo XIV met with a group of homosexuals from the United States, informing them of his intention to continue Francis\u2019s 'pol\u00edtica de aceptaci\u00f3n LGBT' in the Church. Pope Bergoglio also met with gay activists and a trans\u2011women community, though he did not change the Church\u2019s teachings on homosexual acts.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Filo News](https://www.filo.news/noticia/2025/09/06/el-vaticano-recibio-la-primera-peregrinacion-de-la-comunidad-lgbtq-en-el-papado-de-leon-xiv)\n\n**Vatican Hosts First Official LGBT+ Pilgrimage During Jubilee**\nThe article reports that the Vatican hosted its first official LGBT+ pilgrimage during the 2025 Jubilee year. A route called the V\u00eda Franc\u00edgena starts in England, passes through France and Switzerland, and ends at St. Peter\u2019s Square, covering about 130 km. More than 1,400 Catholic LGBT+ individuals and their families from roughly twenty countries participated, according to the Italian association La Tenda di Gionata. The pilgrimage did not include a private audience with Pope Leo\u202fXIV. \n\nKey participants highlighted include Yveline Behets, a 68\u2011year\u2011old trans woman who walked the full distance from Brussels, and Hugo, a 35\u2011year\u2011old Franco\u2011Quebecer who said, 'Es una se\u00f1al realmente importante para nosotros el sentirnos m\u00e1s incluidos' in a statement to AFP. Beatrice Sarti, a 60\u2011year\u2011old Italian who came with her gay son, remarked, 'Nuestros hijos ya no van a la iglesia porque se les hizo sentir que estaban equivocados. Eso debe cambiar'. The article notes that Pope Francis, who served from 2013 until his death in April 2024, had opened the possibility of blessings for same\u2011sex couples in late 2023, sparking opposition in conservative circles, especially in Africa. The piece concludes that the pilgrimage signals a growing push for greater inclusion within the Catholic Church, though doctrinal changes remain slow.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[TVN](https://www.tvn-2.com/mundo/vaticano-recibe-primer-gran-peregrinaje-jubileo_1_2205072.html)\n\n**LGBTQ+ Catholics make Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, acknowledging new sense of acceptance**\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families joined a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, celebrating what they see as a new level of acceptance within the Catholic Church.

Fr. Charlie Gallagher, pastor of Immaculate Conception Church in Washington, D.C., travelled to Rome for the ceremony. He described the atmosphere as 'The atmosphere here is already one of expectant joy, even electric,' and said he expects a crowd of at least 250,000 worshipers on Sunday. The Vatican anticipates that over 32 million pilgrims will travel during the Jubilee year, according to the U.S. Embassy in Italy. Gallagher, who has known Frassati\u2019s niece Wanda for 20 years, said he took Frassati as his patron and that Pope John Paul\u202fII called him the 'Man of the Beatitudes.' He also noted that Acutis, though academically challenged, devoted himself to spreading devotion to the Eucharist. Pope Francis had previously championed Acutis\u2019s cause, and Leo XIV has highlighted technology, especially artificial intelligence, as a major challenge. The article also mentions Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, who reports on the cathedral\u2019s restoration five years after the 2019 fire. Gallagher lived in Rome for four years while a seminarian at the North American College in 2007, and he recalls that Pier Giorgio died in 1925 and his sister Luciana gave birth to Wanda in 1926.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 11:51 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/pope-leo-xiv-canonize-two-modern-saints-weekend-faithful-flock-rome)\n\n**LGBTQ+ Catholics make Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, acknowledging new sense of acceptance**\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families joined a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, celebrating what they see as a new level of acceptance within the Catholic Church.

They discussed the 'tragic situation in Gaza', the need to guarantee a future for the Palestinian people, and the urgent need for a permanent ceasefire. The Holy See said it had 'expected a prompt resumption of negotiations' and that 'all hostages should be liberated'. Herzog thanked the Pope for the 'warm reception' but avoided speaking directly about Gaza, instead urging religious leaders to 'raise their voices to demand the release of hostages'. After the audience, Herzog met with Vatican officials Pietro Parolin and Paul R. Gallagher, where they talked about the political and social situation in the Middle East, the Palestinian future, and the two\u2011state solution. The Israeli president also highlighted freedom of worship and Israel's pride in its Christian community. The Vatican confirmed that it also discussed relations between state authorities and the local church. Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares said Europe must do more to address the violence in Palestine and proposed measures such as an arms embargo on Israel. Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Abulgheit condemned the US decision to revoke Palestinian diplomats' visas for the UN General Assembly.

According to the Vatican Press Office, the meeting focused on the 'tr\u00e1gica situa\u00e7\u00e3o em Gaza' and the need for negotiations that lead to a lasting solution. The Pope urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, safe entry of humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages still held by Hamas. He reiterated that 'Uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de dois Estados \u00e9 a \u00fanica sa\u00edda para a guerra', highlighting the importance of a two\u2011state solution and also drawing attention to events in the West Bank and the status of Jerusalem. After the meeting, Herzog met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, and Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary for Relations with States and International Organizations, where the importance of Christian communities in the Middle East for social cohesion, education and regional stability was emphasized. The Vatican\u2019s appeal comes amid growing international pressure on Israel and on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been criticized by world leaders for Gaza offensives and restrictions on supplies entering the enclave. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would officially recognize a Palestinian state, joining 147 UN member states. Canada is expected to announce support for a Palestinian state at the next UN General Assembly, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has already expressed a favourable position for the two\u2011state solution.

He stressed that a two\u2011state solution is the sole path to ending the war and restoring regional stability. According to a Vatican press release, the conflict that began on 7\u202fOctober\u202f2023 has already claimed more than 64,000 Palestinian deaths and 161,000 injuries, largely among children and women, and has left thousands missing, displaced, and starving. The Pope and his delegation, including Cardinal Pietro\u202fBarolini, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary of State, called for respect of humanitarian law, safe delivery of aid, and the release of all hostages, asserting that the legitimate aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis can only be met through a two\u2011state solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\u202fNetanyahu faces mounting domestic and international pressure to halt the war, amid accusations of delaying peace for political survival. President Hertzog, on X, said he discussed with the Pope ways to strengthen peace and that Israel is doing everything possible to free hostages held by Hamas, urging religious leaders to support immediate release as a step toward a better future for the region. The visit comes amid rising tensions between the Vatican and Israel, following Pope Francis\u2019s criticism of the Gaza war and the Israeli strike on a Catholic church in July. Vatican observers see the Pope\u2019s recent stance as additional diplomatic and moral pressure on Israel, potentially revitalizing the Catholic Church\u2019s role as a spiritual mediator in the Israeli\u2011Palestinian conflict.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 05:14 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6687313)\n\n**Pope Leo XIV discusses Gaza, 2-state solution with Israeli president**\nOn September 4, 2025, Pope Leo XIV met privately with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the Vatican. According to a Vatican statement, the talks focused on the political and social situation in the Middle East and the need to guarantee 'a future for the Palestinian people and peace and stability in the region', with the Holy See reiterating the two\u2011state solution as the only way out of the ongoing war. Herzog also met Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Vatican Secretary for Relations with States Archbishop Paul Gallagher. In a post on X, Herzog thanked Leo for a 'warm welcome today at the Vatican' and said he looked forward to strengthening Israel's cooperation with the Holy See 'for a better future of justice and compassion.' The Vatican communique, longer than usual, called for a resumption of negotiations, a permanent ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages, respect for humanitarian law, and safe entry of aid into Gaza, and expressed hope that the 'legitimate aspirations' of both Israeli and Palestinian peoples could be guaranteed. It also referenced the situation in the West Bank, the city of Jerusalem, and relations between Israeli authorities and the local Church. The Vatican reiterated its call for an international status for Jerusalem, where Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa serves as Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and of the Palestinian territories. During a July visit to Taybeh, Pizzaballa and other Church leaders accused Israeli authorities of 'facilitating and enabling' attacks on Palestinian Christians by settlers. The meeting also touched on ensuring the continued presence of Christian communities throughout the Middle East. Herzog\u2019s statement after the talks highlighted the great significance of the relationship between the Holy See, the State of Israel, and the Jewish people, and the importance of sensitive issues and challenges. A tension arose when Herzog\u2019s office had earlier stated that the visit was at the Pope\u2019s invitation, but the Vatican clarified that it only agrees to requests for audiences from heads of state. The article notes that Vatican\u2011Israel relations had been strained during Pope Francis\u2019s pontificate, when he criticized Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza and called it 'terrorism' and possibly 'genocide'. Pope Leo has taken a more restrained approach, calling for ceasefires, the release of hostages, dignified humanitarian aid, and respect for law.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 04:14 PM\nSource:[Catholic World Report](https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2025/09/04/pope-leo-xiv-discusses-gaza-2-state-solution-with-israeli-president/)\n\n**Vatican, seminar on 'Creation, nature, environment for a world of peace' - Vatican News**\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Holy See, will open the international seminar \"Creation, nature, environment for a world of peace\" on 11 September at 15:00 in Casina Pio IV, Vatican City.

Pope Benedict\u202fXVI had visited Lebanon in September\u202f2012 during a Middle\u2011East apostolic journey from 14 to 16\u202fSeptember, where he met President Michel\u202fSleiman and highlighted inter\u2011religious dialogue and peace, with the theme 'Pace, custode della tua eredit\u00e0'.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[acistampa.com](https://www.acistampa.com/story/31189/papa-leone-in-libano-per-il-cardinale-maronita-bechara-boutros-rai-e-possibile)\n\n**Pope Leo\u202fXIV to Visit Lebanon at Year\u2019s End**\nThe article reports that Pope Leo\u202fXIV is expected to visit Lebanon later this year, most likely in December, according to Lebanese Cardinal B\u00e9chara Boutros Ra\u00ef in an interview with Al\u202fArabiya cited by Reuters.

The article notes that Lebanon hosts about 2\u202fmillion Catholics, mainly Maronites, and that the visit would carry symbolic weight amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, including tensions on the Israel\u2011Hezbollah border and the Gaza war. Archbishop Paul\u202fSayah, another Lebanese cleric, echoed the preparations and highlighted Lebanon\u2019s multicultural, multi\u2011religious character, saying it is a place where Muslims and Christians live together and respect one another and that the visit would send a message to the region. The article also mentions that a papal visit to Lebanon was considered during Pope Francis\u2019s pontificate but was postponed due to his health.

Reports suggest that the visit to Lebanon may be part of the Pope's trip to Turkey in late November for the celebrations of the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, which has not been officially confirmed. In May, Pope Leo XIV was questioned about the interrupted plan of Jorge Bergoglio to go to Nicaea, Turkey, which would have been his first international trip as Pope, and responded that he was 'preparing'. It is expected that the American Pope will resume this interrupted plan and visit Nicaea to celebrate the 1.7 million years of the first great Ecumenical Council. The visit, scheduled for May 26, was strongly desired by Bergoglio, who was preparing it with his friend and Patriarch of the Orthodox, Bartholomew, to strengthen ecumenism among Christians.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 02:12 PM\nSource:[ANSA Brasil](https://ansabrasil.com.br/brasil/noticias/vaticano/2025/08/20/papa-visitara-libano-ate-dezembro-diz-patriarca-maronita_aa12b7a7-5320-42ef-b266-3c7b554f0507.html)\n\n**Pope Leo XIV's Planned Visit to Lebanon: A New Chapter in Vatican-Lebanon Relations**\nCardinal Beshara Rai, the Maronite Patriarch, announced that Pope Leo XIV plans to visit Lebanon 'before the end of December this year', which would likely be his first external move since his election on May 8th. The preparations for the visit are underway, although the official date has not been set yet. The Vatican has expressed a genuine interest in completing this visit to Lebanon, which is home to over 2 million Catholics, according to Vatican statistics. A Lebanese official, speaking to Reuters, stated that 'the consultations are ongoing regarding the visit, with the date to be set in the coming weeks.' The Vatican spokesperson declined to comment directly on Cardinal Rai's statements. The visit may be part of a broader tour that includes Turkey, where the Pope is expected to participate in the celebration of the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea in the city of \u0130znik. Pope Leo had expressed his desire to participate in this event in July, saying, 'I hope to be able to meet you again in a few months to participate in the ecumenical celebration of the Council of Nicaea.' In a message to participants in a youth religious conference in Ankara, according to the Monitor newspaper. The Pope has expressed his deep solidarity with the Lebanese people in the fifth anniversary of the Beirut port explosion, saying, 'Lebanon, the beloved and suffering, remains in our prayers.' He added, 'The tears of Christ join our tears,' in a spiritual expression of his personal empathy with the suffering of the Lebanese people. The potential visit comes after a meeting between the Pope and Lebanese President Joseph Aoun on June 13th in the Vatican. According to church sources, the meeting was 'warm and symbolic,' and during which the commitment of the Holy See to support Lebanon's political and economic stability, and to maintain its religious diversity, which is a cornerstone of Lebanese identity, was reaffirmed. The two sides also discussed the file of reforms and ways to restore the confidence of the international community, as well as the central role of the Maronite Church in social cohesion. This meeting is seen as a preparatory step on the diplomatic level for a formal visit, which could be a turning point in the relations between the Vatican and Lebanon in the post-crisis period. Pope Leo, the first American to hold the papacy, tends to complete the spiritual and political line of his predecessor Francis, but adds a charismatic dimension to it. He has appeared in several occasions surrounded by young crowds, as happened during the 'Youth Jubilee' celebration in Rome, attended by hundreds of thousands from 146 countries. These popular events have shown that the new Pope does not limit himself to the symbolism of the papacy, but seeks to strengthen the global presence of the Church, particularly in areas experiencing crises, such as Lebanon and Turkey, which explains the deep dimensions of his upcoming tour.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 12:43 PM\nSource:[@Elaph](https://elaph.com/Web/News/2025/08/1575261.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives and disciplines\u2014including Catholic Church administration, international religious event logistics, political science, religious studies, sociology, and US regional studies\u2014consensus is extremely strong that Pope Leo XIV will not make a state visit to the United States in 2025. All experts root their forecasts in the historical base rate: no modern pope has visited the US in their first year, and inaugural papal trips are almost always limited to crisis regions, major global church events, or places of acute Christian significance near Rome. Current Vatican and media signals indicate Pope Leo XIV\u2019s 2025 travel is focused on Turkey (for the Council of Nicaea anniversary) and potentially Lebanon and Israel, with absolutely no official mention, rumor, or preparatory activity for a US visit. The US Catholic community, despite its size and importance, has no scheduled global event or major crisis that would prompt such a visit, and the 2025 Jubilee year already draws American pilgrims to Rome rather than the reverse. Experts also note the massive logistical demands and the long planning timeline typically needed for a US papal trip, both of which are absent as of September 2025. Any positive scenario would require an unprecedented, unpredictable crisis or event emerging in the next few months. Final probability estimates range mostly from 1% to 3%, with the upper bound driven only by allowance for extreme surprises; all reasoned analysis points very close to zero. The clear, unified expectation is that Pope Leo XIV will not visit the United States before January 1, 2026."
