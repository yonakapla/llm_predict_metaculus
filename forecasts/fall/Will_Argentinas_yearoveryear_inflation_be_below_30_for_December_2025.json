However, the system remains extremely fragile: the fiscal/monetary anchor is externally funded and politically precarious, reforms are not fully entrenched, and recent minor bumps (localized Peronist wins, currency and asset jitters, higher-than-expected service inflation) show how fast expectations and outcomes can turn. Historical base rates for massive disinflation succeeding after one year are low in Argentina, and all IMF/private forecasts cluster near or just above 30% even after major improvement. My base rate from comparable EM disinflations is ~33% for hitting a strict sub-30% in year two after hyperinflation; however, the current reform trajectory and backstopping justifies a modest upward adjustment. Market and forecast consensus clusters around 30\u00b13%. There is *some* upside to official figures being optimistic, but INDEC is still the resolution source.

Paradoxically, the stronger the negative political and social reaction to austerity, the greater the risk of reform reversal, which in turn would break disinflation. However, with only two months to go, any full policy unwind would not immediately reflect in December\u2019s numbers due to monetary/price adjustment lags. Additionally, U.S./IMF support is likely to remain at least until December\u2019s data is released, making a sudden loss of reserve backing (and so a sharp depreciation-driven surge) unlikely short-term.\n\nThere is still some risk that a modest reacceleration in monthly prints (as seen in September) pushes the YoY number just above 30%. But with the mathematical base effect, ongoing external support, and the political cost of backtracking still high this close to year-end, Argentina is plausibly on course to just scrape under 30%. The distribution is tightly clustered around the 28\u201332% band, with minor stochastic (shock) risk on either side.

Some reports cite 28% for December, but the most recent official (Indec) figure is 31.8% in September, with no clear evidence of further deceleration. Notably, the IMF has recently revised inflation projections upwards (to 41.3%), likely in anticipation of political turbulence, partial policy reversals, or base effects (as 2024Q4\u2019s high-inflation months drop out of the YoY calculation). On the other hand, Argentina\u2019s policymakers and some bullish analysts cite <30% as plausibly within reach if discipline holds. However, from a Public Choice perspective, the sustainability of Milei\u2019s discipline is seriously in doubt given mounting structural hardship, a history of policy ebb/flow around elections, and Market/Electoral reactions as seen after Peronist local victories and shifts in bond and FX rates. Moreover, the official statistics may slightly understate inflation, but not by a wide enough margin to guarantee a Yes unless there is aggressive manipulation.

The risk now is *reversal*: midterm election instability could see Milei's government lose leverage, and the political economy of distributive conflict could sharply reassert itself, especially if real wages and employment remain depressed. However, with only three months to go and September's inflation at 2.1% and annual YoY at 31.8%, *if* inflation holds at current (or lower) monthly rates, December's YoY will be just under 30%. Even if October or November sees a temporary bounce (2.3\u20132.5%), the cumulative base makes breaching 30% hard unless an immediate macro shock intervenes. IMF forecasts (41% for 2025) reflect institutional skepticism and political risk, but are likely lagging the most recent, sharp disinflation patterns. My institutionalist perspective makes me skeptical of lasting 'miracles,' and downside political risks in the coming months are meaningful, but with the latest observable data and inertia, the window for catastrophic reversal before year-end is narrowing.

Even a run-of-the-mill service price or FX scare in October/November could bleed through\u2014and expectations are still highly unstable. The window for catastrophic reversal may be narrowing, but your 65% sounds like you\u2019re forecasting Switzerland, not Argentina. Temper that optimism: conditional convergence to sub-30% is plausible, but positive skew and tail risk of a (likely) near-miss demand a much less bullish stance."

You mention past IMF pessimism overshoots, Milei's bullishness, and the surreal convergence to low 30s in official and private forecasts, yet you let 'structural and political fragilities' dominate your estimate near parity. In reality, dependency theory should focus much more on the role of overwhelming external anchoring\u2014IMF/US have every incentive to prop up the regime through year-end\u2014and on how quickly last year's hyperinflated months are about to drop out of the calculation. In other words: the 'miracle' you're so skeptical of is already 75% realized, contingent mostly on just a couple more boring months.

My probability (65%) initially synthesized the institutional inertia, mathematical base effects, and political risk.

Critiques warning of Phillips Curve naivety or the ever-present risk of last-minute chaos hold water for Argentina\u2019s long-run outlook, but less for this specific, near-term horizon, especially as political events (midterms) may not have economic transmission mechanisms fast enough for the December 2025 data.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nIn December 2023, when Javier Milei was inaugurated as President of Argentina, the [month-over-month inflation rate](https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-rate-mom) of the country was 25.5%. Milei's top campaign promise [was](https://www.freiheit.org/one-year-javier-mileis-economic-policy) to fight inflation.

He expressed disgust with the current inflation rate of 30%, emphasizing that the government fixed money supply levels in mid-2024. Milei reaffirmed his commitment to reducing inflation and improving economic conditions, citing that 12 million people have been lifted out of poverty and 6 million out of indigence. He criticized the previous Kirchnerist administration for leaving behind 57% inflation and economic stagnation, contrasting it with his administration\u2019s achievements. Milei dismissed critics, including those who predicted economic collapse, and asserted that Argentina is experiencing historically low crime rates. He highlighted a broad consensus on the need for tax, labor, and structural reforms, warning that the Kirchnerist faction seeks to steer Argentina toward Venezuela or Cuba. Milei confirmed that cabinet reshuffles will occur after the October 26 legislative elections, though he declined to name individuals, noting that Santiago Caputo 'may have a central role.' He praised Diego Santilli, the La Libertad Avanza candidate in Buenos Aires Province, calling him a 'tremendous candidate' and stating that the campaign is focused on ideas rather than personalities.

Despite implementing multiple programs to curb inflation, the country has failed to achieve lasting success. The dominant political-economic ideology, Peronism, is a form of populist leftism where the populace uses the state as a tool for mutual benefit. The country is presidentially governed. In the November 2023 general election, Javier Milei, a self-described 'right-wing' economist, won the presidency. He promised 'revolutionary' structural reforms based on a pure free-market system. His economic policy began with a currency reform, which was justified as Argentina's core economic problem was the lack of a stable currency. Argentinians and foreigners alike had lost trust in the Argentine peso, which had undergone 12 zero deletions in its history and even had its name changed. In 1991\u20131996, Harvard-educated economist Domingo Cavallo pegged the peso to the U.S. dollar, successfully reducing inflation, but his program ultimately failed due to resistance from Peronist cultural norms. Milei, upon taking office in 2023, inherited an annual inflation rate of 98.8% (2022). After devaluing the peso, cutting subsidies, reducing public spending, lowering taxes, closing ministries of environment, health, and education, privatizing state-owned enterprises, removing price controls, and reforming collective bargaining and strike laws, inflation soared to 254% in 2023 due to devaluation. However, it dropped to 84% in 2024 and was projected to end 2025 at 28%. Notably, the last four months had monthly inflation below 2%. Milei\u2019s strategy appeared successful, but in the previous month\u2019s local elections, a Peronist candidate defeated Milei\u2019s candidate by 13 percentage points. Markets interpreted this as 'Milei is going', causing the peso to lose 5% in value, the stock index to drop 10.5%, and Argentine sovereign bonds traded internationally to lose 16% in value. The central bank faced a dilemma: defending the peso by selling foreign reserves would jeopardize payments on maturing government bonds. Fortunately, a sudden intervention by 'H\u0131z\u0131r Trump' (a metaphorical reference) saved the situation\u2014Argentina received a 20 billion dollar peso purchase commitment, temporarily avoiding a liquidity crisis. Despite economic stabilization, the political reality remains: Peronists are expected to win the next presidential election, and they are unlikely to sustain structural reforms. Since such reforms take 4\u20135 years to yield lasting results, the country\u2019s future depends on public rationality.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 02:04 AM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/hinzir-hizir-p247306)\n\n**Argentina's Inflation Slightly Accelerates Ahead of Midterm Elections**\nArgentina's inflation rate rose slightly to 2.1% in September, up from 1.9% in August and the highest since April, according to the official statistics institute (Indec).

This is the final inflation data released before the midterm legislative elections on October 26, 2025, as the Argentine government negotiates financial assistance with the U.S. Treasury to stabilize currency fluctuations. President Javier Milei's administration has significantly reduced inflation in its first year through peso devaluation and subsidy cuts, which have increased costs for housing, healthcare, and education. However, some citizens, like 65-year-old bus driver Omar Amante\u2014who voted for Milei in 2023\u2014dispute the official figures, stating, 'How can it be that you go to the supermarket with the same bill and come back with nothing?

The updated report, released on October 14, 2025, revised downward the projected GDP growth from 5.5% (as forecast in April 2025) to 4.5% for 2025, a one-percentage-point reduction. Inflation projections were raised from 35.9% to 41.3%, an increase of 5.4 percentage points. For 2026, the IMF now forecasts GDP growth of 4.0%, half a percentage point below the previous estimate, and inflation at 16.4%, two percentage points higher than earlier projections. Despite these deteriorating outlooks, the official government projections remain more optimistic, anticipating GDP growth of 7.5% by year-end\u2014up from 6.3% projected in April. The IMF noted that global economic growth has seen only a slight improvement, remaining significantly below the pre-pandemic average of 3.7%. The organization emphasized that uncertainty around trade policy remains high due to the lack of clear, transparent, and durable agreements among trading partners. It also observed that while protectionist trade measures have so far had limited impact on economic activity and prices, the focus is shifting toward their effects on investment and consumption.

Breaking the Cycle of Debt and Dependency**\nThe article analyzes Argentina's economic crisis through the lens of a proposed U.S.-backed 'blindaje' (financial shield) of $40 billion, contingent on the outcome of the October 26 legislative elections. It draws parallels to the 2001 crisis, when a similar $40 billion IMF-led package failed to prevent collapse, instead deepening austerity and debt burdens on workers. The current 'blindaje'\u2014led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent with $20 billion in swaps and $20 billion from private banks\u2014comes with the condition that it will only proceed if President Javier Milei's coalition wins the elections. The article argues this creates a false dichotomy: either maintain an overvalued peso and unsustainable debt (perpetuating dependency on imperialism), or face a chaotic devaluation. Despite Milei's claims of economic reform, the economy has entered formal recession (two consecutive quarters of contraction), unemployment has risen sharply (205,456 formal jobs lost since November 2023), and key sectors like industry, construction, and transport have seen massive job losses. Inflation remains high (2.1% monthly in September), and the IMF has downgraded its growth forecast for Argentina to 4.5% (from 5.5%) while raising inflation projections to 28%. The article criticizes the government's reliance on foreign capital and the FMI, calling for national sovereignty, the end of debt dependency, and the reorganization of the economy through worker-led initiatives, nationalization of banks, and control over strategic sectors to avoid a 2001-style collapse. It emphasizes that the working class and poor must lead the struggle to break the cycle of debt, capital flight, and foreign domination.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 01:12 AM\nSource:[La Izquierda Diario](https://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Deuda-y-entrega-o-devaluacion-falsa-dicotomia)\n\n**Javier Milei Predicts Zero Inflation by August 2026 and Outlines Post-Election Cabinet Changes**\nArgentine President Javier Milei stated during an interview on October 17, 2025, that inflation in Argentina will reach 0% by August 2026, attributing this forecast to a 26-month lag in monetary policy effects.

She stated that even if Javier Milei does not win the elections, she remains hopeful because Argentina continues to advance in deregulation and economic reform, citing a shift from negative growth to 4.5% GDP growth, inflation dropping from triple digits to 28%, and the elimination of the fiscal deficit. She emphasized that the IMF supports Argentina due to a 'genuine interest' in reform over the past two years, working closely with the Argentine government and key partners like the U.S. Treasury, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. However, the IMF revised its 2025 GDP growth forecast downward from 5.5% to 4.5%, and inflation projections rose from 35.9% to 41.3% annually. The current account deficit is now projected at 1.2% of GDP\u2014up from 0.4% in April\u2014due to declining commodity prices and reduced imports ahead of elections. The unemployment rate is expected to rise from 6.3% to 7.5%, with the IMF noting deteriorating labor market conditions in the first quarter of 2025. The IMF also revised its outlook for Argentina\u2019s return to international debt markets, now expecting it later than initially projected.

The IMF now expects Argentina's GDP to grow by 4.5% in 2025 (down from 5.5% projected in July) and 4% in 2026 (down from 4.5%). Inflation is projected at 28% for 2025, up from 20% in April\u2014an 8 percentage point increase. The current account deficit is now forecast at -1.2% of GDP, a significant deterioration from the previous estimate of -0.4%. Unemployment is expected to rise to 7.5% in 2025 (from 6.3%) and 6.6% in 2026 (from 6%). These revisions reflect a deteriorating economic situation following a quarter of governmental instability. The Bank of Argentina\u2019s latest Market Expectations Survey (REM) projects a 0.6% contraction in GDP for the third quarter of 2025 and a 3.9% annual growth rate\u2014lower than the IMF\u2019s forecast. The projected growth in 2025 is largely due to a statistical 'drag effect' from 2024\u2019s severe first-half contraction, not real economic recovery. With a contraction in the second quarter and a projected fall in the third, Argentina is on the brink of formal recession, dependent only on calendar timing. Inflation, which rose nearly 2% between April and October, has moved far from the official target of 1% monthly\u2014Milei\u2019s condition for removing currency controls. The IMF expects inflation to decline to 10% in 2026 (from 12% in April), diverging from the official 2026 budget projection and private-sector estimates of 19%. A worsening current account deficit indicates that the peso\u2019s competitiveness has not significantly improved despite dollar volatility, with the currency\u2019s competitiveness level now back to July levels after peaking in mid-September. The data collectively suggest that achieving Javier Milei\u2019s projected 2026 growth trajectory will be extremely challenging.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 03:38 AM\nSource:[laarena.com.ar](https://www.laarena.com.ar/el-pais/el-fmi-preve-mas-inflacion-y-un-menor-crecimiento-202510150380)\n\n**IMF Worsens Economic Projections for Argentina Ahead of Trump-Milei Bilateral**\nIn the lead-up to the bilateral meeting between Donald Trump and Javier Milei, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) worsened its economic projections for Argentina. The updated report, released on October 14, 2025, revised downward the projected GDP growth from 5.5% (as forecast in April 2025) to 4.5% for 2025, a one-percentage-point reduction. Inflation projections were raised from 35.9% to 41.3%, an increase of 5.4 percentage points. For 2026, the IMF now forecasts GDP growth of 4.0%, half a percentage point below the previous estimate, and inflation at 16.4%, two percentage points higher than earlier projections. Despite these deteriorating outlooks, the official government projections remain more optimistic, anticipating GDP growth of 7.5% by year-end\u2014up from 6.3% projected in April. The IMF noted that global economic growth has seen only a slight improvement, remaining significantly below the pre-pandemic average of 3.7%. The organization emphasized that uncertainty around trade policy remains high due to the lack of clear, transparent, and durable agreements among trading partners. It also observed that while protectionist trade measures have so far had limited impact on economic activity and prices, the focus is shifting toward their effects on investment and consumption.

He claimed that 'when the money doesn\u2019t reach, it\u2019s because the State is excessive,' and asserted that economic adjustment was borne by the 'casta' (elite), not ordinary citizens, citing public spending cuts and executive salary freezes since December 2023. Milei promised inflation would be 'history by 2026,' referencing a University of C\u00f3rdoba study projecting 26 months of monetary policy lag. Despite this optimism, official data from INDEC shows poverty reached 31.6% in the first half of 2025\u2014about 14 million people\u2014with child poverty at 47.2%. Private forecasts project annual inflation near 30%, and real wages remain below pre-adjustment levels. Milei also claimed to have lifted 12 million people out of poverty and that six million now eat who didn\u2019t before\u2014claims contradicted by social organizations and experts. He praised security policies under Diego Santilli and Patricia Bullrich, attacked 'guarantists' and 'perisobres,' and projected Argentina could reach Spain\u2019s per capita GDP in 10 years and Germany\u2019s in 20, possibly matching the U.S. within 30 years. The event marked the start of a federal campaign tour to rebuild support after the political scandal involving Jos\u00e9 Luis Espert, with upcoming visits to Mendoza, Santa Cruz, Chaco, and Corrientes, culminating in a planned meeting with Donald Trump in Washington on October 13, just before the legislative elections. Milei emphasized a message of fiscal discipline, reduced state intervention, and market freedom, citing Alberto Benegas Lynch (h) on liberalism as 'unrestricted respect for others\u2019 projects,' and declared 2025 'the year of the reconstruction of the Argentine Republic,' vowing to defend fiscal order 'with nails and teeth.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 05:56 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/milei-en-mar-del-plata-cuando-la-plata-no-te-alcanza-te-sobra-estado.phtml)\n\n**Milei Manipulates Poverty Rate \u2013 Media and Politics Are Misled**\nJavier Milei is praised internationally for lowering inflation and poverty, but Argentine statistics agencies and independent observers dispute the official figures. According to INDEC, poverty fell from 53\u202f% at Milei\u2019s inauguration in December\u202f2023 to 31.6\u202f% in 2025, a drop that INDEC staff now reject as misleading. They argue that the claim that the administration freed more than 12\u202fmillion people is unsubstantiated. Rodolfo Aguiar of ATE Nacional says the real poverty rate is 62\u202f%. The UCA\u2019s Observatory for Social Debt calls the INDEC decline \"over\u2011represented\" and \"inaccurate\", while CEPA warns that the agency\u2019s methodology underestimates poverty because the national survey on household spending has not been updated. Analysts note that 40\u202f% of the informal sector earns below the poverty line and that four in ten workers are in informal employment. Between 2024 and 2025, homelessness in Buenos Aires rose by almost 30\u202f%. Economist Hans\u2011J\u00fcrgen Burchardt warns that Milei\u2019s \"cut\u2011throat\" policies could trigger a recession, reduced spending, and a downward spiral of employment. The article quotes Burchardt saying, 'Die aktuelle Regierung hat die Armutsmessung ver\u00e4ndert, um die Statistik zu sch\u00f6nen', and Aguiar saying, 'Der INDEC und seine Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen werden f\u00fcr Wahlzwecke missbraucht.

The article argues that this \u2018devastation\u2019 did not occur because Milei never fully carried out the promised reforms.  Instead, he adopted more conventional policies, mainly deep austerity, which the piece describes as \u2018feroce e molto traumatiche\u2019 but not radically different from those proposed by centre\u2011right candidate Patricia\u202fBullrich or recommended by the IMF.\n\nMilei\u2019s administration has been criticised for weakening democracy, threatening press freedom and dismantling institutions that defend human rights and minorities.  Economically, the article highlights that inflation \u2013 which was about 140\u202f% annually when Milei took office, after hovering near 300\u202f% \u2013 fell to 36.6\u202f% in July\u202f2024.  This decline was achieved by turning a fiscal deficit into a surplus through a harsh austerity campaign that froze wages and pensions, laid off more than 30\u202f000 public employees, halted many infrastructure projects and cut subsidies for the poorest.\n\nThe article quotes Milei saying the peso was \u2018meno di un escremento\u2019 and explains that the government raised interest rates, required banks to hold more reserves and sold dollar reserves to support the peso\u2019s value.  It notes that the peso\u2019s appreciation has helped curb inflation but also made imports cheaper and exports more expensive, potentially harming domestic industry.\n\nSocial indicators are mixed: poverty fell from 41.7\u202f% in December\u202f2023 to 34.7\u202f% in May\u202f2025 after the inflationary shock, yet the austerity cuts have harmed the most vulnerable.  The article reports a 20\u202fbillion\u2011dollar IMF loan and a 6.1\u202f% GDP growth in Q1\u202f2025, but warns that inflation remains far above the 2\u202f% target and that the peso\u2011support strategy is increasingly problematic.\n\nThe piece concludes that Milei\u2019s reforms may be stalling and that his lack of parliamentary majority limits his ability to push further liberalisation.  It frames the situation as a potential experiment that could either recover or fail, drawing parallels with past Argentine presidents.\n\nKey metrics cited: inflation 140\u202f% \u2192 36.6\u202f%; poverty 41.7\u202f% \u2192 53\u202f% \u2192 34.7\u202f%; IMF loan ~20\u202fbillion\u202fUSD; GDP growth 6.1\u202f% Q1\u202f2025.\n\nQuotes used: 'meno di un escremento', 'dato eccellente', 'inflazione 140\u202f% circa', 'pesa ha un valore abbastanza alto', 'inflazione 36,6\u202f%'.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 08:14 AM\nSource:[Il Post](https://www.ilpost.it/2025/09/14/milei-argentina-economia/)\n\n**Argentina\u2019s Inflation Hits 1.9% in August, 33.6% Year\u2011On\u2011Year, Amid Milei\u2019s Economic and Political Turmoil**\nThe Argentine government, led by President Javier\u202fMilei, reported that inflation in August 2025 was 1.9% month\u2011over\u2011month, according to the \u00cdndice de Pre\u00e7os ao Consumidor (IPC) released by the Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edsticas e Censos (Indec).  The figure was slightly below economists\u2019 expectation of 2% and matched the 1.9% recorded in July.  The 12\u2011month cumulative inflation fell to 33.6%, down from 36.6% in July.  Indec data show that inflation has been easing during Milei\u2019s first year in office, with the monthly rate stabilising between 2% and 3% in 2025 and recently falling below 2%.\n\nMilei\u2019s economic programme has involved a large adjustment: after taking office in December\u202f2023 he halted federal works, stopped state transfers and removed subsidies for water, gas, electricity, public transport and other essential services, which has pushed consumer prices higher.  Poverty rose in the first half of 2024 to 52.9% of the population, but fell to 38.1% in the second half, representing 11.3\u202fmillion people.\n\nPolitically, Milei has faced a crisis after a leaked audio alleged that his sister, Karina\u202fMilei, and a government official were collecting bribes from pharmaceutical companies.  \"Est\u00e3o roubando. Voc\u00ea pode fingir que n\u00e3o sabe, mas n\u00e3o joguem esse problema para mim, tenho todos os 'WhatsApp' de Karina,\" said former Andis chief Diego\u202fSpagnuolo.\n\nThe president suffered a heavy defeat in the Buenos\u202fAires provincial election on 7\u202fApril, the most important election in the country, which accounts for almost 40% of the national electorate.  The result triggered a market reaction: government bonds, local stocks and the Argentine peso fell sharply.  On 8\u202fApril the peso hit a record low of 1,423\u202fpesos per dollar, a decline of more than 27% against the dollar.\n\nIn early April Milei secured a $20\u202fbillion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF); the first tranche of $12\u202fbillion was disbursed shortly thereafter.  The loan is part of a broader debt package that already exceeds $40\u202fbillion.  Milei\u2019s goal is to keep inflation below 2% per month and to eliminate capital controls that hinder investment.\n\nFollowing the IMF agreement the Central Bank reduced currency controls, ending the fixed parity for the peso and introducing a floating exchange rate.  The government also allowed citizens to hold dollars outside the formal banking system without declaring their source, and in June launched measures to increase dollar liquidity, reduce money supply and intervene directly in the foreign\u2011exchange market to stabilise the currency and attract investment.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 07:04 PM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2025/09/10/inflacao-argentina-agosto.ghtml)\n\n**Argentina Improves Economic Indicators, but Numbers Tell Only Part of the Story**\nArgentina\u2019s economy has shown some headline improvements under President Javier\u202fMilei, who took office in December\u202f2023.  The government\u2019s sharp spending cuts, subsidy eliminations and a new currency\u2011band regime have brought the annual inflation rate down from a peak above 250\u202f% to 4.2\u202f% in August\u202f2024, according to the Instituto Nacional de\u202fEstat\u00edstica e\u202fCenso (INDEC).  Fiscal policy has swung from a 5\u202f% deficit to a primary surplus, and the IMF has approved a US$\u202f20\u202fbillion loan that has bolstered reserves to roughly R$\u202f109.2\u202fbillion.  Analysts note that the currency band keeps the peso between 1,000 and 1,400\u202fpesos per dollar, a temporary measure that \u201cworks because the Central Bank has dollars to intervene, but does not solve the structural problem,\u201d said economist Paulo\u202fFeldmann (FIA Business School).  Growth is projected at 5.5\u202f% for 2025, and the Merval index has risen 174.46\u202f% in pesos (114.91\u202f% in dollars) in 2024, reflecting a risk\u2011laden rally.  However, high interest rates (\u2248\u202f50\u202f% per year), a heavy reliance on external credit and the looming IMF payment schedule (US$\u202f60\u202fbillion in 2027) keep long\u2011term fundamentals fragile.  In a recent interview, Economy Minister Luis\u202fCaputo highlighted a drop in poverty from 57\u202f% to 30\u202f% and a doubling of dollar reserves, but the article stresses that the country\u2019s credibility hinges on sustained policy stability and eventual transition to a floating exchange rate.

Economists warned of a collapse. By December\u202f2023 Argentina was in recession: monthly inflation 25\u202f%, a consolidated fiscal deficit of 15\u202f%, a looming 10th default and hyperinflation. Milei\u2019s policy package\u2014deregulation plus a 30\u202f% cut in state spending\u2014eliminated the deficit, lowered inflation to below 2\u202f%, and lifted growth above 5\u202f%. Poverty fell by more than 20\u202f% since early\u202f2024. The article argues that the \"economic miracle\" has shocked Keynesian economists who claim that spending must rise in a recession. It claims the media silence stems from ideological discomfort with a president who proves that lower state spending can spur growth and reduce poverty. The author, Philipp\u202fBagus, a professor in Madrid, calls this a \"Vogel\u2011Strauss tactic\" to ignore the libertarian success story. Key metrics: monthly inflation 25\u202f% (Dec\u202f2023) \u2192 <\u202f2\u202f% (2024); deficit 15\u202f% \u2192 eliminated; growth >\u202f5\u202f% (2024); poverty drop >\u202f20\u202f% (2024).

This performance puts Argentina ahead of countries like China, Indonesia, and Brazil. Since taking office in late 2023, President Milei has implemented a 'zero deficit' policy, cutting spending by closing or merging departments, suspending public works, and reducing government subsidies for services like electricity, water, and public transportation. He has also initiated a privatization process for state-owned enterprises, reduced bureaucracy and taxes, and eliminated currency controls. As a result, Argentina's inflation rate has decreased significantly, from 25.5% monthly and 211.4% annual in December 2023 to 1.6% monthly and 39.4% annual in June 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 10, 2025 08:47 PM\nSource:[blogdobg.com.br](https://www.blogdobg.com.br/argentina-deve-ter-segundo-maior-crescimento-do-pib-entre-as-25-maiores-economias-do-mundo/)\n\n**Milei's Government: Services Rise 25%, Salaries and Goods Fall Against Inflation**\nSince President Javier Milei took office, the prices of services have increased by 25% in real terms, while salaries and goods have decreased against inflation. According to a report by the Gerencia de Estudios Econ\u00f3micos del Banco Provincia, the inflation rate has accumulated a 220% increase since November 2023 to June 2025. In this scenario, public services such as housing, transportation, and communication have gained more than 25% in real terms, but other private services such as education, health, restaurants, cinemas, and hotels are currently 12% above the level when Milei took office. In the same period, food and beverages have fallen 8% below the average price, compared to November 2023. Other goods, such as electronics, clothing, motorcycles, or furniture, have increased in price and are now 12% below. 'This reconfiguration of prices is typical of the processes of exchange rate appreciation: services rise more than goods,' said the center of studies. On the other hand, formal salaries have risen 190% between November 2023 and April 2025, losing 6.5% in real terms. 'The inflationary process of Milei had different stages. A first moment where inflation accelerated due to devaluation. There, food and beverages and public service tariffs rose a lot because the subsidy scheme needed some type of modification plus a more contractive fiscal policy,' said Mat\u00edas Rajnerman, head of macroeconomics at Banco Provincia. 'Then, inflation starts to decelerate, whose main factor of explanation is the exchange rate appreciation. So, goods run below services,' concluded. In agreement, economist Florencia Iragui explained that, although there was a strong correction of relative prices at the beginning of the government, not all adjusted in the same way. 'An example are fuels. They rose 111% between December 2023 and January 2024, but then fell a bit and, since March 2024, they have remained practically unchanged, at a level 14% above the relative price of 2019. On the other hand, prices like trains and subways show a more marked up and down due to the fact that the increases were given some months but there were others with 0% variation,' graphed Iragui.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 17, 2025 08:55 AM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/economia/2025/07/17/desde-que-asumio-milei-los-servicios-subieron-25-pero-los-salarios-y-los-bienes-cayeron-contra-la-inflacion/)\n\n**Milei's Economic Reforms Yield Results in Argentina**\nWhen Javier Milei was elected as Argentina's president in December 2023, many predicted a disaster. Inflation was at 211%, nearly every other citizen lived in poverty, and the country's foreign exchange reserves were dwindling. However, 18 months later, it appears that the libertarian economist's shock therapy has yielded results - at least on a macroeconomic level. According to the OECD's latest country report, inflation has plummeted dramatically. In May 2025, the monthly rate was 1.5%, the lowest in five years, and the annual rate is expected to remain at 37%, compared to nearly 300% a year earlier, as reported by Dagens Industri. Argentina's GDP is expected to grow by over 5% this year, and the government's finances have turned to a small surplus, according to the same source. Behind these numbers lies a program of massive cuts, including the closure of 10 departments, the dismissal of tens of thousands of state employees, reduced subsidies, and frozen pension payments. The president himself symbolized the measures by wielding a chainsaw during his campaign rallies. 'The successful fiscal tightening has already led to a significant decrease in the risk premium on Argentine government bonds,' writes the OECD in its report. The free fall that began with the reforms has now started to turn around. This is evident in households' increased purchasing power, rising real wages, and stable unemployment rates around 6%, despite nearly half of Argentinians still working informally. Consumption has become an unexpectedly strong driver of the recovery, according to the OECD.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 02:41 AM\nSource:[Realtid.se](https://www.realtid.se/marknader/milei-mot-alla-odds-sa-vande-han-ekonomin/)\n\n**Milei's Economic Impact: A Painful Success or the Dawn of a New Argentina?**\nSince taking office on December 10, 2023, President Javier Milei's economic management has had a significant impact on Argentina's economy, with results that some have described as a 'economic miracle' in a context of prolonged crisis and historically high inflation. Before Milei's arrival, Argentina faced an annual inflation rate of nearly 211%, with over 50% of the population in a state of poverty. The economy was in recession due to years of exchange controls, high state intervention, and erratic economic policies. Milei managed to improve the economic environment and achieved a significant reduction in inflation. Despite not having a majority in Congress, he demonstrated political skill in negotiating with moderate sectors and passing key laws that promoted his economic agenda in a fragmented political scenario. Milei's government implemented a fiscal adjustment without precedent, significantly reducing public spending. This included the elimination or reduction of energy and transportation subsidies, the suspension of public works, and a significant reduction in public salaries and pensions. As a result of these policies, Argentina's monthly inflation rate decreased significantly, from 25.5% in December 2023 to 1.5% in May 2025, the lowest rate in five years. Although the accumulated inflation remains high, the deceleration of the monthly rate is a key indicator of a downward trend. The agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the acquisition of external financing were crucial for strengthening international reserves and sustaining economic policy without resorting to uncontrolled monetary emission. In summary, Milei's government has achieved a deep and, so far, successful economic adjustment in a country with a history of recurrent crises. His combination of fiscal discipline, structural reforms, political management, and economic opening has laid the foundations for Argentina to reduce inflation to historic lows and resume growth. However, social costs and political challenges persist. It is still too early to celebrate victory, but the economic results achieved to date have been very positive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[ruizhealytimes.com](https://ruizhealytimes.com/economia-y-negocios/el-impacto-economico-de-milei-un-exito-doloroso-o-el-amanecer-de-una-nueva-argentina/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025 are divided but generally center around moderate probabilities, with most forecasters rating a sub-30% outcome as plausible but not certain. Positive factors include recent sharp disinflation, monthly inflation stabilizing near or just above 2%, fiscal and monetary tightening under Milei, supportive base effects (high late-2024 inflation falling out of the YoY window), and temporary external backstops from the IMF and US Treasury. These conditions make a rapid drop below the 30% threshold mathematically possible even in the near term.\n\nHowever, almost all experts highlight Argentina's structural fragilities: persistent inflation inertia, political risks (especially with imminent midterm elections and potential for policy reversal), the historic difficulty of sustaining deep disinflation, and the risk of external or currency shocks. There is concern that despite recent progress, inflation expectations remain fragile, reforms are socially costly, and previous cycles of stabilization have often quickly reversed around electoral or credibility shocks. Questions about INDEC's data credibility and the political incentive to manipulate or smooth statistics before or after elections are also frequently noted.\n\nFinal forecast probabilities range from a low of 35-42% (public choice, dependency theory, some macro experts) to a high of 64-70% (sovereign risk, Phillips Curve, institutionalist perspectives), with a mode (most common) in the low 60s. Most scenarios envision the YoY number landing just under (28-29.9%) or just over (31-33%) the 30% line, hinging on whether macro discipline and political stability can be maintained through December. No forecaster views the outcome as certain: distribution is tightly clustered around the threshold, with substantial\u2014but not dominant\u2014risk on either side. Overall, the expert consensus is slightly optimistic for a just-below-30% print if current trends persist but remains wary due to Argentina\u2019s history of late reversals, political volatility, and the possibility of shocks derailing recent progress.",
