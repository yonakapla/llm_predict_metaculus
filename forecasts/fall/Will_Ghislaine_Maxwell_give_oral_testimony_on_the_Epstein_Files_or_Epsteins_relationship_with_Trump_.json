All reliable, recent reporting indicates the House has abandoned efforts to compel Maxwell\u2019s testimony after her attorney made clear her refusal to cooperate and intent to invoke the Fifth. No new committee action has been reported since late November, and the congressional calendar is dwindling. Maxwell\u2019s conditions (immunity or commutation) will not be granted; cooperation of DOJ/BOP would be minimal without clear congressional will. Historically, Congress rarely compels incarcerated witnesses to appear when they promise only non-responses. No political urgency is apparent: public attention is now focused on the Clintons, and Trump allies have little to gain and some risk in putting Maxwell in the spotlight. The only plausible Yes scenario is a last-minute performative move, but all evidence (committee statements, witness posture, media focus) points away from this. The base rate for last-minute changes of this sort, especially given the committee\u2019s recent abandonment, is close to zero. Thus, the most likely outcome is No.",

Furthermore, precedent for holding such hearings with high-profile, actively appealing convicted felons is extremely thin. The House committee has pivoted its efforts toward other witnesses (e.g., the Clintons). Nonetheless, my perspective in custodial witness management reminds me that very low-probability but high-profile \u201cshow trials\u201d or political stunts are possible\u2014especially once other efforts stall or if unforeseen political opportunities arise, such as a bid to showcase 'transparency' even when testimony will be non-substantive. The question\u2019s resolution criteria explicitly count even Fifth-pleading oral appearances\u2014so an intentionally empty hearing could serve a political purpose for someone. On balance, the probability is well below even, but above the absolute minimum due to the small but real potential for late political drama.",

Your forecast would be stronger if you ditched the 'remote chance of external shock' rhetoric: even major leaks in the Epstein case have been swiftly diffused without forcing live testimony. This scenario isn't just unlikely\u2014it's essentially protected against."

My own Elite Theory lens already saw the massive elite self-protection at work, but the group hammered home how abandonment is not just passive but actively enforced by status-quo power structures. Additionally, strong arguments from other fields made it clear that even the bare minimum of a hearing is logistically and procedurally shielded against, barring truly extreme, unprecedented shocks for which there is zero signal.

Speaking in an interview, Massie stated that he believes Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, was connected to Epstein, saying, 'I think he helped Mossad.' He further suggested that Epstein collected compromising information on politicians for blackmail purposes and provided women in exchange for favors, stating, 'He was someone who provided what his clients wanted, and in return, he obtained certain favors.' Massie emphasized that the full disclosure of Epstein's files would be embarrassing for both U.S. intelligence (CIA) and Israeli intelligence. The Epstein case, which involved allegations of sexual abuse of minors and running a sex trafficking ring, led to the deaths of prominent figures such as Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak, Al Gore, Kevin Spacey, Michael Jackson, David Copperfield, Alan Dershowitz, and Bill Richardson, according to released documents. The FBI and U.S. Department of Justice concluded that no evidence was found for a 'client list,' and Epstein was ruled to have died by suicide in prison. Tucker Carlson previously claimed Epstein worked for Israel, asserting that 'everyone in Washington thinks this, but no one says it openly.' The Wall Street Journal reported that Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate, asked a guest at Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday party to write a letter to Trump, which was allegedly one of the letters sent.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 01:21 PM\nSource:[NTV](https://www.ntv.com.tr/dunya/epstein-dosyalarinda-mossad-ayrintisi-1699171)\n\n**U.S. Representative Claims CIA and Mossad Were Linked to Epstein**\nU.S. Republican Representative Thomas Massie claimed in an interview that both the CIA and Israel's Mossad were influential in the process of releasing Jeffrey Epstein's files. Massie stated that he believes Israel's intelligence agency and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were connected to Epstein, and that Epstein likely assisted Mossad. He also suggested Epstein may have gathered compromising information on politicians for blackmail purposes, providing women in exchange for favors. Epstein, who was accused of sexual abuse and running a prostitution ring involving minors aged 14 and above, was found dead in his New York jail cell on August 10, 2019. The released court documents included prominent figures such as Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak, Al Gore, Kevin Spacey, Michael Jackson, David Copperfield, Alan Dershowitz, and Bill Richardson. The FBI, after investigating with the U.S. Department of Justice, concluded there was no evidence of a 'client list' and that Epstein likely died by suicide, despite claims by some that he was murdered to suppress evidence.

The DOJ emphasized it would redact sensitive information, including details about sex-trafficking victims and other personal data. While the recently passed law does not explicitly reference grand jury testimony\u2014only one witness\u2019s testimony (an FBI agent) was confirmed in a New York case last summer\u2014multiple grand juries, including in Florida, may have been involved, with the total volume of material unknown. Grand jury proceedings are confidential by law, protecting individuals not charged and allowing looser rules of evidence than in criminal trials. The Epstein case has remained politically charged, with Republican allies like former FBI Director Kash Patel advocating for release, while Democrats have questioned whether President Donald Trump knew of Epstein\u2019s trafficking activities and failed to act. Trump, who had a past friendship with Epstein, denies any knowledge of underage prostitution and has called the allegations a 'hoax' used to deflect from Democratic failures. The Justice Department and FBI previously stated no further disclosure was warranted, but the Republican-led House Oversight Committee recently released thousands of pages from Epstein\u2019s estate, including messages suggesting Trump knew of the abuse but did not participate. Epstein was indicted in 2019 and died in custody; Maxwell was convicted in 2022 and sentenced to 20 years. In 2025, she was transferred to a lower-security prison and interviewed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, sparking Democratic accusations of leniency in exchange for potential testimony exonerating Trump\u2014claims the White House strongly denies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 06:53 PM\nSource:[NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/justice-dept-again-asks-for-epstein-grand-jury-testimony-to-be-unsealed/KZV4FK4USJCFBBQULOYSUBRHVI/)\n\n**Justice Department requests to unseal Epstein, Maxwell grand jury records**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, filed a motion on November 23, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida requesting the unsealing of grand jury transcripts from the sex trafficking cases of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This request follows the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandates the release of all unclassified Epstein-related records within 30 days. The Justice Department argued that the Act\u2019s clear mandate requires the court to authorize disclosure and lift existing protective orders, while committing to redact victim-related and personal identifying information. The motion was signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and U.S. Attorney Jason Quinones and seeks an expedited ruling due to the 30-day deadline. President Trump, who previously opposed the bill, signed it into law on November 20, 2025, despite having once been friends with Epstein\u2014though he has not been accused of wrongdoing. Epstein was indicted in July 2019 on federal child sex trafficking charges and died by suicide in August 2019. Maxwell was indicted in June 2020, convicted in December 2021, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. This is the latest effort to unseal the records; in August 2025, a New York judge denied a similar request, stating that the materials would not provide meaningful new information and could mislead the public. Epstein, a wealthy financier with high-profile connections, had pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida and served 13 months in jail. The case gained renewed public attention in July 2025 when the Justice Department released a two-page memo claiming a 'systematic review' revealed an 'incriminating client list,' though no credible evidence of blackmail was found. This followed Bondi\u2019s February 2025 statement that such a list was 'sitting on my desk right now.' Multiple batches of Epstein-related documents have been released over the years, with the most recent tranche of tens of thousands of pages released earlier in November 2025 by House Democrats and the House Oversight Committee.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 01:25 AM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-requests-unseal-epstein-maxwell-grand-jury-records/)\n\n**Congress warns Clintons over Epstein case**\nUS House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has issued subpoenas requiring former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to testify before Congress about their connections to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex trafficker. The subpoenas, approved by the committee, mandate that both appear for in-person depositions\u2014Bill Clinton on December 17 and Hillary Clinton the following day. Comer warned that failure to comply could result in contempt of Congress proceedings, citing their history with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein was first convicted in 2008 and charged again in 2019 with trafficking minors and operating an underage sex ring before dying in a Manhattan jail cell later that year. Bill Clinton previously admitted to traveling on Epstein\u2019s jet but denied ever visiting Epstein\u2019s island. A spokesperson for the Clintons stated that Bill Clinton severed ties with Epstein long before his 2019 arrest and was unaware of his alleged crimes. Meanwhile, on November 22, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a bill requiring the Justice Department to release Epstein-related files, marking a shift from his prior stance of opposing the release, which he had claimed was politically motivated by Democrats. Trump said the move could reveal 'the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 04:32 PM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/628194-oversight-committee-warning-clinton-epstein/)\n\n**U.S. Department of Justice Repeats Call for Release of Epstein Case Grand Jury Documents**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice reiterated its request for the release of grand jury documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, following the passage and signing into law of the 'Epstein Files Transparency Act' by the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump. In a filing with the Manhattan federal court, prosecutor Jay Clayton requested a swift ruling from Judge Richard Berman, arguing that the newly enacted law mandates the disclosure of grand jury records. The Department of Justice asserted that this law is the most recent and binding legal requirement for public access to such records. Judge Berman had previously rejected a similar request from the Trump administration, stating in August that the information in the records was already in the DOJ\u2019s possession and that the content was 'insignificant.' Some victims of the Epstein case have expressed concern that releasing the documents could expose their identities, and thus oppose their public disclosure. Epstein, accused of sexual abuse involving over a dozen minors under 18 and operating a sex trafficking ring, was found dead in his New York City jail cell on August 10, 2019. The released case files included names of prominent figures such as Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak, Al Gore, Kevin Spacey, Michael Jackson, David Copperfield, Alan Dershowitz, and Bill Richardson. The FBI, after investigating with the DOJ, concluded that no evidence was found of a 'client list' but determined that Epstein likely died by suicide, not murder, despite claims by some that he was killed to cover up a conspiracy involving government officials, celebrities, and businesspeople. Tucker Carlson claimed Epstein worked for Israel, while The Wall Street Journal reported that Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s associate, requested letters from notable individuals for Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday, including one allegedly from Trump.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 08:43 PM\nSource:[TRT haber](https://www.trthaber.com/haber/dunya/abd-adalet-bakanligi-epstein-davasindaki-buyuk-juri-belgelerinin-aciklanmasi-talebini-yineledi-926863.html)\n\n**Epstein Files Reveal Mossad Connection Allegations Amid Intelligence Influence Claims**\nU.S. Republican Congressman Thomas Massie claimed that Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies influenced the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.

The Epstein case, which involved allegations of sexual abuse of minors and running a sex trafficking ring, led to the deaths of prominent figures such as Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak, Al Gore, Kevin Spacey, Michael Jackson, David Copperfield, Alan Dershowitz, and Bill Richardson, according to released documents. The FBI and U.S. Department of Justice concluded that no evidence was found for a 'client list,' and Epstein was ruled to have died by suicide in prison.

Originally subpoenaed in August, the Clintons requested to submit written answers instead of appearing live, arguing it would be 'most efficient and equitable.' Comer rejected this request, stating the committee is not obligated to accept their preferred method and emphasized that face-to-face depositions are mandatory. The depositions are scheduled for December 17 (Bill Clinton) and December 18 (Hillary Clinton). Comer stressed the committee\u2019s commitment to transparency and accountability for Epstein\u2019s victims and the American public. While Bill Clinton has admitted to traveling on Epstein\u2019s jet, he denies visiting Epstein\u2019s island, and no formal criminal accusations have been made against either Clinton. The subpoenas come after President Donald Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandates the Justice Department to release unclassified records, investigative materials, and communications related to Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and individuals referenced in prior cases. The release of over 20,000 pages of Epstein-related documents by Republicans, though containing unverified claims, has drawn scrutiny and implicated several prominent Democrats, including Larry Summers, Stacey Plaskett, Kathryn Ruemmler, and Hakeem Jeffries. Comer made clear that no individual, including the former first couple, is above the law in this investigation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 10:46 PM\nSource:[PJ Media](https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/11/23/the-clintons-risk-prison-if-they-defy-epstein-subpoenas-n4946330)\n\n**Justice Dept asks court to unseal Epstein grand jury files**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has filed a motion requesting the court to unseal grand jury documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, citing a congressional mandate to release the materials within 30 days. The DOJ emphasized it would redact sensitive information, including details about sex-trafficking victims and other personal data. While the recently passed law does not explicitly reference grand jury testimony\u2014only one witness\u2019s testimony (an FBI agent) was confirmed in a New York case last summer\u2014multiple grand juries, including in Florida, may have been involved, with the total volume of material unknown. Grand jury proceedings are confidential by law, protecting individuals not charged and allowing looser rules of evidence than in criminal trials. The Epstein case has remained politically charged, with Republican allies like former FBI Director Kash Patel advocating for release, while Democrats have questioned whether President Donald Trump knew of Epstein\u2019s trafficking activities and failed to act. Trump, who had a past friendship with Epstein, denies any knowledge of underage prostitution and has called the allegations a 'hoax' used to deflect from Democratic failures. The Justice Department and FBI previously stated no further disclosure was warranted, but the Republican-led House Oversight Committee recently released thousands of pages from Epstein\u2019s estate, including messages suggesting Trump knew of the abuse but did not participate. Epstein was indicted in 2019 and died in custody; Maxwell was convicted in 2022 and sentenced to 20 years. In 2025, she was transferred to a lower-security prison and interviewed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, sparking Democratic accusations of leniency in exchange for potential testimony exonerating Trump\u2014claims the White House strongly denies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 06:53 PM\nSource:[NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/justice-dept-again-asks-for-epstein-grand-jury-testimony-to-be-unsealed/KZV4FK4USJCFBBQULOYSUBRHVI/)\n\n**House committee demands Clintons testify in-person on Epstein case - Conservative Journal Review**\nThe House Oversight Committee, led by Chairman James Comer (R-KY), has demanded that former President Bill Clinton and former First Lady Hillary Clinton appear in person on December 17 and 18, 2025, in Washington, D.C., to testify about their connections to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, rejecting their legal team\u2019s request for written statements only. The committee had previously voted in July 2025 with bipartisan support to issue subpoenas, signaling the investigation is not partisan. Comer dismissed claims that the Clintons' testimony would be trivial, asserting Congress has the authority to require live questioning for thorough oversight. He emphasized that the Clintons\u2019 history with Epstein and Maxwell justifies the demand, warning that avoiding testimony could lead to contempt of Congress proceedings. President Donald Trump, who signed a bill on November 19, 2025, to release additional Epstein-related files, publicly criticized the Clintons, stating Epstein was a lifelong Democrat who donated to Democratic politicians and was linked to prominent Democratic figures, including Bill Clinton. Trump\u2019s remarks, posted on Truth Social, suggested the investigation may expose deeper political ties. While the push for transparency is framed as a pursuit of justice for survivors, the intense public confrontation raises concerns about whether the proceedings are driven by genuine accountability or political theater, though bipartisan support for the committee\u2019s actions lends credibility to the effort.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 05:17 AM\nSource:[conservativejournalreview.com](https://conservativejournalreview.com/house-committee-demands-clintons-testify-in-person-on-epstein-case/)\n\n**Justice Department requests to unseal Epstein, Maxwell grand jury records**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, filed a motion on November 23, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida requesting the unsealing of grand jury transcripts from the sex trafficking cases of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This request follows the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandates the release of all unclassified Epstein-related records within 30 days. The Justice Department argued that the Act\u2019s clear mandate requires the court to authorize disclosure and lift existing protective orders, while committing to redact victim-related and personal identifying information. The motion was signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and U.S. Attorney Jason Quinones and seeks an expedited ruling due to the 30-day deadline. President Trump, who previously opposed the bill, signed it into law on November 20, 2025, despite having once been friends with Epstein\u2014though he has not been accused of wrongdoing. Epstein was indicted in July 2019 on federal child sex trafficking charges and died by suicide in August 2019. Maxwell was indicted in June 2020, convicted in December 2021, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. This is the latest effort to unseal the records; in August 2025, a New York judge denied a similar request, stating that the materials would not provide meaningful new information and could mislead the public. Epstein, a wealthy financier with high-profile connections, had pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida and served 13 months in jail. The case gained renewed public attention in July 2025 when the Justice Department released a two-page memo claiming a 'systematic review' revealed an 'incriminating client list,' though no credible evidence of blackmail was found. This followed Bondi\u2019s February 2025 statement that such a list was 'sitting on my desk right now.'

Comer warned that failure to comply could result in contempt of Congress proceedings, citing their history with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein was first convicted in 2008 and charged again in 2019 with trafficking minors and operating an underage sex ring before dying in a Manhattan jail cell later that year.

Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., stated that sending staff and members to Texas\u2014where Maxwell is incarcerated in a federal prison camp\u2014would be a poor use of taxpayer funds if she would not cooperate. Maxwell had previously declined to testify unless granted immunity, given questions in advance, and only after her appeals were resolved. The committee had issued a subpoena in July and had previously received a full transcript of Maxwell\u2019s two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in July 2025. The Justice Department released that transcript the following month. Meanwhile, Comer confirmed the committee remains focused on deposing former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, accusing them of avoiding accountability despite Trump\u2019s extensive cooperation. Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted in 2021 on federal sex trafficking charges, was transferred to a less restrictive, women-only facility days after her Blanche interview. She has reportedly expressed being 'much happier' there, and a whistleblower claims she is seeking a presidential commutation of her sentence from Donald Trump, though the White House maintains it does not comment on potential clemency requests.

The contents of the newly released package are still unknown, though thousands of pages from the investigation are already public. The committee had previously received a first batch of documents after a DOJ subpoena last month and expects additional releases that will protect victim identities and remove any child\u2011sexual\u2011abuse material. Epstein, a wealthy financier who died in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking minors for sexual massages, has been the subject of conspiracy theories that he was murdered to prevent embarrassing revelations. According to The Wall Street Journal, Donald Trump\u2019s name appeared in hundreds of the documents reviewed by the DOJ, but no evidence of wrongdoing was found. Trump supporters claim that the \u2018Deep State\u2019 protected Epstein\u2019s associates in the Democratic Party and Hollywood. In July, the FBI and DOJ declared Epstein had committed suicide, did not blackmail any prominent figure, and had no \u2018client list\u2019. The DOJ also released a transcript of an interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, who says Trump had a friendly relationship with Epstein but that 'the president never was inappropriate with anyone'. Maxwell, serving a 20\u2011year sentence for recruiting minors for Epstein, was interviewed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, former personal lawyer of Trump, and was subsequently transferred from a Florida prison to a minimum\u2011security center in Texas.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 12:37 AM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**US House committee releases batch of 'Epstein files'**\nA U.S. House Oversight Committee released a first batch of more than 33,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the former financier who died in a New\u202fYork jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for alleged sex\u2011trafficking of underage girls.

He added that the estate is ready to provide documents. The committee also announced that former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta will testify voluntarily in September; Acosta had a 2008 non\u2011prosecution agreement with Epstein.

Rep. James Comer, R\u2011Ky., chair of the House Oversight Committee, said in a Monday\u2011night statement that 'There are many records in DOJ's custody, and it will take the department time to produce all the records and ensure that the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted.' He added that he 'appreciates the Trump Administration's commitment to transparency and efforts to provide the American people with information about this matter.' The DOJ has not yet responded to a request for comment. Comer did not provide a timetable for the release of the documents. Earlier in the month, Comer had sent a subpoena to the DOJ for Epstein\u2011related records and deposition subpoenas to former officials from the Bush, Clinton, Obama and Trump administrations. The article notes that Epstein was found dead in his New York jail cell in 2019, ruled a suicide, and that his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of aiding the sexual abuse of teenage girls and is serving a 20\u2011year prison sentence. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell at a Florida courthouse last month, and the DOJ has sought to unseal grand\u2011jury transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases. Comer told reporters that former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr had spoken with lawmakers on Monday, saying that Barr 'never had conversations with President [Donald] Trump pertaining to a client list, he didn't know anything about a client list' and that he had 'never seen anything that would implicate President Trump in any of this.' The DOJ and FBI officials earlier this month said there was no evidence that Epstein kept a 'client list' or engaged in a blackmail scheme, and that his death was due to suicide. Several members of Congress have attempted to pass resolutions to have the federal government release any files related to Epstein. The DOJ said it would move to unseal exhibits related to both the Epstein and Maxwell investigations, but a federal judge denied the DOJ's request for the grand jury materials, saying that the government failed to meet the exceptions applied in past rulings. Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote that 'Granting the government's motion would bloat the special circumstances doctrine, which to date has warranted disclosure in only a tiny number of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious public or historical moment.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 10:19 PM\nSource:[Santa Clarita Valley Signal](https://signalscv.com/2025/08/doj-to-start-handing-over-epstein-files-to-congress/)\n\n**Department of Justice to Provide Documents on Jeffrey Epstein Investigation to Congress**\nThe Department of Justice has agreed to provide the US Congress with documents related to the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking case, according to a member of the House of Representatives. The move appears to avoid a potential separation of powers showdown. The documents will be handed over to the House Oversight and Reform Committee starting this Friday. Representative James Comer, the committee's chairman, said, 'There are many files under the DOJ's custody, and it will take time for the department to present all the documents and ensure that the victims' identities and any child abuse material are censored.' Comer praised the Trump administration's commitment to transparency and efforts to provide information to the American people about the case. Epstein, a wealthy and well-connected financier, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019, weeks after his arrest, which investigators ruled as a suicide. His ex-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in 2021 of helping to lure teenagers to be sexually abused by Epstein and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. The committee's subpoena requested all documents and communications related to the Epstein and Maxwell case, as well as records of communications between the Biden administration and the Department of Justice regarding Epstein, and documents related to a previous federal investigation in Florida that resulted in a non-judicial agreement in 2007.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 03:48 PM\nSource:[Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/08/18/departamento-de-justicia-entregar-de-archivos-de-la-investigacin-de-jeffrey-epstein-al-congreso/)\n\n**US House of Representatives Subpoenas Bill and Hillary Clinton to Testify on Epstein Case**\nThe US House of Representatives' Oversight Committee has subpoenaed former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, who also served as US Secretary of State, to testify about the case of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire accused of trafficking minors who died in prison in 2019. In addition to them, former attorneys general and former FBI directors have been summoned to testify about the 'horrific crimes' committed by Epstein. Epstein had connections with Wall Street millionaires, members of the royal family (notably Prince Andrew), and celebrities before being convicted of child sex trafficking in 2008. The charges that led to his imprisonment in 2019 occurred more than a decade after a judicial agreement that protected him. He was found dead by hanging just over a month after being released from prison. As a campaign promise, President Donald Trump said he would release documents related to the Epstein case if he returned to the White House. In January, when the Republican released files on the investigation, a climate of dissatisfaction took over: the information already known. Pressured, Trump became the target of a conspiracy theory within his MAGA base, that he is on a secret list of people who benefited from Epstein's scheme. While Trump faces a showdown in MAGA, Republican Congressman Scott Perry managed to get approval for a subcommittee to demand testimony from the Clintons and former high-ranking federal agents. The expectation is that the testimonies will ultimately reveal more information about Epstein's conspiracy. At the same time, Democratic Congresswoman Summer Lee also obtained approval for a motion to summon DOJ files related to the case. It is, therefore, a bipartisan effort. After Perry and Lee's conquests, Republican President of the Investigative Committee, James Comer, sent the subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Also summoned were former attorneys general Jeff Sessions, Alberto Gonzales and William Barr (who served in the governments of George W. Bush and Trump), and Merrick Garland, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder (governments of Barack Obama and Joe Biden). Former FBI directors James Comey and Robert Mueller complete the list. In a letter to Bill Clinton, Comer recalled that the former president flew four times on Epstein's private jet. The congressman said that the Democrat would have 'pressured' the American magazine Vanity Fair not to publish accusations of sex trafficking against the billionaire. He also said that Clinton was 'supposedly close' to Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite who acted as Epstein's right-hand woman. Currently, she is serving a 20-year prison sentence, although she is trying to overturn the sentence. 'Given your previous relationships with Mr. Epstein and Mrs. Maxwell, the Committee believes that you have information about their activities that is relevant to the Committee's investigation,' Comer wrote. In addition, Comer wrote in a letter to Hillary Clinton that 'your family seems to have had a close relationship with both Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.' The two, according to the congressman, may 'have knowledge of the government's efforts to combat international sex trafficking operations of the type commanded by Mr. Epstein.' The testimonies of Hillary and Bill were scheduled for 9 and 14 October, respectively. \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 05, 2025 05:47 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/camara-dos-eua-convoca-bill-e-hillary-clinton-para-depoimento-sobre-caso-epstein/)\n\n**US House Committee Summons Clintons to Testify on Epstein Ties**\nThe US House of Representatives' Oversight Committee has summoned former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify about their connections to billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who led a sex trafficking and abuse ring. The committee has also called on former Attorneys General Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions, William Barr, and Merrick Garland, as well as former FBI Directors Robert Mueller and James Comey. Additionally, the committee has subpoenaed current US Attorney General Pam Bondi to provide documents related to the Justice Department's investigations into Epstein and his partner in the scandal, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, by August 19. The testimonies are scheduled to take place throughout August, September, and October. 'Although the Department of Justice is working to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to the Epstein and Maxwell cases, it is imperative that Congress oversee the federal government's application of sex trafficking laws and, specifically, its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Epstein and Maxwell,' said Rep. James Comer, the committee's Republican chairman. Epstein was accused in 2019 of leading a sex trafficking ring and took his own life in prison while awaiting trial, but the case has drawn attention due to rumors of a supposed 'client list' that allegedly included high-profile politicians and media figures. Epstein had socialized with President Donald Trump in the 1990s and maintained friendships with the Clintons and others.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 05, 2025 03:46 PM\nSource:[ANSA Brasil](https://ansabrasil.com.br/brasil/flash/internacional/2025/08/05/comissao-da-camara-convoca-casal-clinton-a-depor-sobre-epstein_3c18b926-9a83-4090-b9a7-eba2f85eb19d.html)\n\n**Ghislaine Maxwell Offers to Testify Before Congress in Exchange for Immunity and Clemency**\nGhislaine Maxwell, a British socialite convicted of sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison for her involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's scheme, has stated through her lawyers that she is willing to testify before the US Congress, but only if a list of demands is met. Maxwell has requested immunity from prosecution, advance access to questions, and even presidential clemency as conditions for testifying. In a letter sent to the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Maxwell has asked that the hearing not take place at the federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, where she is currently serving her sentence, and that it only occur after the resolution of a pending Supreme Court appeal and a future habeas corpus petition. She has also stated that she will not answer surprise questions. The letter also makes an explicit appeal to Donald Trump for clemency, stating that 'if she receives a pardon, she is willing -- and eager -- to testify publicly and transparently in Washington.' Maxwell's lawyer, David Markus, wrote that the request is strategic, as Trump has been criticized for not fulfilling his promise to reveal the truth about the Epstein case. According to Maxwell's defense, the committee's subpoena, scheduled for August, is 'unacceptable' in the current circumstances, as testifying from prison without minimum legal guarantees is 'an impossible starting point.' The initial plan was for Maxwell to invoke the Fifth Amendment, the right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination. The House Oversight Committee has already publicly rejected the idea of granting immunity, stating that 'we do not consider granting parliamentary immunity to someone who may have participated in child sex trafficking.' However, the tone of the letter suggests a willingness to negotiate, stating that 'after careful consideration, we would like to find a way to cooperate with Congress, as long as there is a safe and fair path.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 09:51 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/cumplice-de-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-pede-imunidade-para-depor-sobre-caso/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasters strongly agree that it is extremely unlikely Ghislaine Maxwell will provide oral testimony in a US Congressional hearing about the Epstein Files or Epstein's relationship with Trump before January 1, 2026. The leading reasons across domains are: (1) Maxwell has unequivocally refused to testify without immunity or clemency, and has repeatedly stated she will invoke her Fifth Amendment rights if compelled. (2) Congressional committees, after initially moving to subpoena her, have now deprioritized her testimony following her legal team's refusal and have shifted focus to other witnesses, with public announcements supporting this. (3) The logistical, legal, and procedural hurdles involved in arranging for an incarcerated, high-profile federal prisoner to appear at a hearing\u2014especially on short notice\u2014are formidable and have almost no precedent. (4) Both elite self-preservation dynamics and bipartisan institutional interests further decrease the likelihood of an unpredictable, high-profile hearing that could damage multiple stakeholders. (5) The remaining time before the resolution deadline is very short (about five weeks as of late November 2025), rendering any last-minute scheduling or deal-making virtually impossible. Forecasters leave a low single-digit nonzero probability (1-9%) only to account for highly unlikely last-minute political theater or some unforeseeable dramatic development. In all, the consensus is that the outcome will be No, unless a major and currently unforeseen breakthrough or political upheaval occurs within the very narrow window remaining.",
