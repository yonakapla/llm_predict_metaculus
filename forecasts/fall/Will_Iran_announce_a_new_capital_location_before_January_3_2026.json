Despite repeated top-level references to relocation, the leap from necessity rhetoric to a policy announcement naming a new capital (even without implementation) historically requires elite unity, regime desperation, and a trigger event, such as failed rationing or genuine public collapse. The news shows heightened pressure, tougher language, and mention of specific locations (Makran/Hormozgan), but as of now, language remains largely at the proposal or inevitability phase. The flood of high-level rhetoric, naming of prospective regions, and the countdown to a potential capital collapse all raise the odds, but the inertia of Iranian policy process and the lack of evidence of a formal, explicit selection still dominate.

Unlike previous decades of debate, the conversation has rapidly advanced from abstract warnings to public, official proposals naming specific regions (Hormozgan/Makran) and referring to relocation as inevitable. Although implementation is extremely doubtful in the short-to-medium-term, the acute crisis forms a 'focusing event' that makes a formal announcement of a new capital location much more probable than at any time in modern Iranian history.\n\nMy urban planning expertise points to the huge logjams imposed by financial, political, and institutional feasibility. But, crucially, the question resolves on announcement, not actual relocation. With a narrowing window for demonstrating leadership, and candidate locations already floated (notably Makran, as cited repeatedly), it is now plausible for leadership to 'name' a new capital in coming weeks, especially as water reserves and public confidence both hit bottom. Precedent from other crisis-driven capital moves (e.g., Indonesia) suggests long planning, but strongman governments can and do make bold-sounding announcements as political theater. In this environment, I assess the probability as significantly above base rate, though not overwhelming because there remains a notable chance of inertia, elite disunity, or last-second hesitation in crossing the formal threshold of naming a place.

The regime uses the announcement as a symbolic turning point, a bid for regime resiliency, national mobilization, and blame-shifting, even without immediate implementation. The decision is driven by the need to show decisive action amid a crisis intractable to short-term technical fixes, and as a response to both domestic and international pressure.",

Presidential rhetoric has reached an unprecedented level of urgency: multiple credible reports confirm statements that the move is now 'unavoidable' and not a 'choice.' Unlike past episodes, there is an explicit linkage of policy to specific regions (e.g., Makran), and sustained elite/policy discourse emphasizing the need for a bold solution. Institutional and budgetary barriers, as well as the low base rate for actual capital move implementation, argue against practical follow-through. However, the fine print requires only an official, public announcement naming the new location, regardless of subsequent implementation\u2014lowering the bar significantly.\n\nIf the acute crisis persists or deteriorates and social/political unrest risks rise, regime logic (from a principal-agent and legitimacy management standpoint) will shift toward risk-acceptant displays of agency. In such contexts, symbolic politics favor headline-grabbing announcements as a last-resort demonstration that the government is acting. The president personally and repeatedly raising the issue, combined with clear statements of 'necessity,' strongly amplifies the probability that a location-specific announcement will be made (even in the absence of realistic follow-through).\n\nBalancing these considerations with the status quo bias and recognizing that capital move talks have historically stalled short of naming a location, but are now closer than in the past, I judge the probability is notably elevated. Given the extraordinary nature of the crisis, explicit framing of no alternative, and elite-level signaling, the probability is above a coin flip, but not close to certainty, given regime caution and resource constraints.\n\nOn balance, I assess a probability of 65%.",

However, carefully parsing both media reports and stated regime incentives, there is still a difference between urgent rhetoric/promises and a legally or formally binding announcement identifying a specific new capital. Historical regime tendencies, base rates, and the political/elite obstacles to actually specifying a new capital constrain the probability. Given that no clear, unequivocal official statement with the necessary specificity has yet emerged\u2014even after weeks of intense public attention\u2014and given that past base rates for this kind of announcement in authoritarian states (especially in the midst of a crisis rather than after extensive elite consensus) are low, my assessment is that there is a high chance of no announcement, but the odds are materially higher than at any prior point in Iran\u2019s history.

The technical, fiscal, and elite-political constraints on such an announcement are immense, and base rates for such public commitments (even in crisis) remain low except in exceptional political ruptures (e.g., military coups, capital relocations post-independence, or after disasters). The main upside risk is the unique extremity of the current water crisis and the degree of elite political consensus described in recent news, which increases the probability above the historical norm. Given how close Iran is to the brink, I judge that a nominal announcement remains plausible\u2014but still not probable\u2014by January 3, 2026.

President Pezeshkian has cited relocation as a 'necessity, not an option,' and media reports repeatedly mention the Makran region and Hormozgan as proposed destinations. Historically, states under acute urban crises have, on occasion, made rapid capital relocation announcements, but most often these are deferred until at least the appearance of a medium-term solution or a window for consensus or symbolic action. Iran\u2019s political structure allows the president to make dramatic statements, but final decisions\u2014especially public, irreversible ones\u2014require at least tacit approval from the Supreme Leader and buy-in from security and economic elites, whose interests are deeply centered in Tehran. Several sources frame current pronouncements as proposals or warnings rather than binding, formalized declarations. However, the specificity and urgency of the current rhetoric, the repeated naming of Makran/Hormozgan, and the regime's need for an 'out' amid escalating crisis (with little else to offer the public) brings the probability of meeting the resolution criteria notably higher than in any previous year. Still, the risk is real that the government will only increase the volume and specificity of 'considering relocation' without issuing the qualifying official announcement. Given the base rates for such moves, but offset by the extreme immediacy and the unusually detailed and urgent nature of the current crisis and statements, a 'Yes' is credible but not yet likely.

First, while existential crisis can prompt extraordinary decisions, Iran\u2019s political culture and institutional setup generally default to incrementalism, conflict avoidance, and symbolic action over rapid, binding, and irreversible moves\u2014especially those affecting state geography and long-standing elite interests. Second, while Pezeshkian and some experts (as well as some official reports) name Makran, Hormozgan, or Bandar Abbas as potential targets, there has not (to date) been a formalized, explicit cabinet resolution, parliamentary vote, or Supreme Leader directive stating that a specific location is designated the new capital. Third, given the fine print, the question will only resolve Yes if such a location is officially named\u2014not if the leadership continues to float proposals, issue dire warnings, or even begin preparatory studies. Fourth, even in a year, the regime may prefer to continually push the narrative of need/inevitability, balancing urgency with the practical demands of elite consensus, budget-making, and national unity. Nevertheless, the unprecedented crisis, international embarrassment, and acute domestic discontent could push Iran\u2019s leadership to 'pull the trigger' for political effect, even if only at the level of an official announcement, without immediate implementation.

Bureaucratic inertia in Iran is legendary, and the global base rate for such moves on short timelines is extremely low.

You point to the spectacle of political theater after a focusing event (like Indonesia), but Iran\u2019s sclerotic bureaucracy, elite fragmentation, and risk aversion are far more likely to produce a cycle of studies, proposals, and dire warnings than a binding, location-specific announcement. You give short shrift to the political tightrope\u2013supreme leader involvement, IRGC interests anchored in Tehran, and the massive costs all militate against bottom-heavy, last-minute executive declarations. Even when Iranian rhetoric gets specific, it has historically failed to translate to formal action, especially on national symbols like the capital.

You are substituting processual caution for hard-up, regime-saving political calculation\u2014the basic equation changes dramatically when signals of system collapse and regime legitimacy are at stake. You also overlook repeated official mentions of specific regions\u2014not just vague platitudes, but the naming of Makran/Hormozgan over and over in sources that are rapidly approaching the specificity threshold. When the regime needs to show action, especially in the international spotlight as a failed megacity, it can and will make a dramatic announcement, even if that announcement is symbolic, impractical, or never followed through. The odds of an explicit, face-saving, region-naming announcement have never been higher, and to dismiss this as 'business as usual' fundamentally misses the catalytic power of true existential urban disaster."

On reflection, it is prudent to shade my probability downward to acknowledge that, even in moments of crisis, Iran\u2019s ruling structures may double down on incrementalism and symbolic action absent an undeniable rupture. The risk of the regime 'talking tough' and naming candidate regions\u2014without a formal, county-level naming\u2014remains substantial.

While acknowledging that the current crisis radically raises the probability relative to history and prior years, the 65% I initially assigned appears too bold given the inertia, self-preservation motives of the elite, and established Iranian tendency to escalate rhetoric without formalizing specific commitments.

However, the high probabilities (such as 75% or even 65%) are rooted more in crisis psychology and extrapolation from loud regime rhetoric, rather than from the actual mechanism of elite consensus formation or the proven Iranian preference for ambiguity and staged process. My critique of over-extrapolation stands: recent events make a location-specific announcement more plausible than ever, but not likely. Still, the group discussion revealed a slightly more compelling case that the regime might see a symbolic, explicit announcement\u2014even if not implemented\u2014as a necessary face-saving measure, potentially outweighing some elite objections in the near-term. This, combined with the feedback loop of mounting international and domestic scrutiny, justifies a modest upward revision.

While one forecaster (Urban Planning) assigns a very high probability (75%) by emphasizing crisis-driven theater and the exceptionality of the current moment, critiques from administrative and political disciplines clearly show how even state-shaking emergencies rarely short-circuit the Iranian policy process. Even the Political Science and case-based urban relocation forecasters pegging probabilities somewhat higher than mine remain well below certainty, and stress both the low base rate and the distinction between dramatic rhetoric and real, committed public declarations. Across the debate, no compelling new arguments emerged that would justify moving my probability higher.

The most optimistic assessments (e.g., 75%) heavily discount the demonstrated inertia of Iran\u2019s elite-centered system, the strategic preference for ambiguity, and the lack of a truly binding, irrevocable announcement to date despite repeated high-level statements and region-naming.

On balance, the risk of Yes is tangibly heightened but remains outmatched by the structural and historical drag pulling toward continued dithering and performative politics. Considering all this, the case for nudging the probability slightly downward (from my initial 40%) is justified: the consensus among informed, methodologically rigorous forecasters\u2014and my own review\u2014suggests the regime is likelier to continue escalating the rhetorical brinkmanship without crossing the formal announcement line by January 3, 2026.",

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned in early December that water rationing would be implemented if no rain falls by December, stating that residents may be forced to evacuate\u2014though experts question the feasibility of such an evacuation. The crisis extends far beyond Tehran: according to Dr. Mousen B. Mesgaran, Associate Professor of Plant Sciences at the University of California, Davis, no rainfall has occurred in about 20 Iranian provinces since the start of the rainy season in September. Reuters reports that approximately 10% of Iran\u2019s dams are effectively dry. Underlying causes include decades of over-extraction, aging and leaky infrastructure, excessive dam construction, poor management, and corruption, all exacerbated by climate change, which has driven rising temperatures and prolonged droughts, preventing replenishment of dried reservoirs. Iran\u2019s current drought is the worst in at least 40 years. While water scarcity is common in the country\u2019s generally semi-arid climate, Tehran\u2014home to most of the wealthy and powerful\u2014has historically been spared. According to Tehran Province Water Health Authority, major dams supplying the city are at just 11% capacity, with the Latyan Dam at only 9%. Since May, water levels have drastically dropped, leaving riverbeds nearly dry with only minimal flow remaining. Outside Tehran, reservoirs supplying Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second-largest city with about 3 million people, have dropped to just 3% capacity, according to ISNA news citing local water authorities. Iran\u2019s environmental deputy minister, Kaveh Madani, describes the situation as a long-term, irreversible catastrophe, declaring Iran is in a state of 'water bankruptcy,' with groundwater extraction far exceeding natural recharge rates, affecting rivers, lakes, wetlands, and aquifers.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 06:26 AM\nSource:[CNN.co.jp](https://www.cnn.co.jp/world/35241146.html)\n\n**Iran's president calls for moving its drought-stricken capital amid a worsening water crisis  --  how Tehran got into water bankruptcy**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has revived the long-debated proposal to relocate Tehran, the capital with a population of 15 million, due to an escalating water crisis. The city faces an impending 'Day Zero'\u2014when it runs out of water\u2014amid one of Iran's worst droughts in decades. Although fall marks the start of the rainy season, precipitation has been well below normal in four of the past water years since 2020, and fall 2025 was the hottest and driest on record for Tehran since 1979. The crisis stems from decades of overconsumption, inefficient agriculture, subsidized water and energy use, uncontrolled urban expansion, and centralized water governance that has failed to balance supply and demand. Iran's reliance on water-intensive farming and large-scale dam projects since the 1979 revolution, compounded by international sanctions and economic isolation, has exacerbated the situation.

The crisis, described as 'water bankruptcy,' stems from decades of unsustainable urban expansion, over-extraction of groundwater, and weak environmental governance. Satellite data from CSIS (2024) showed declining reservoir levels, and by early 2025, AP News reported that Tehran's main dams operated at less than 10% capacity. Groundwater depletion has caused land subsidence, with hydrologists confirming emergency pumping levels. Climate change exacerbated the situation, but the root cause is political mismanagement. A 'water mafia' network, involving illegal wells and corrupt water permits, thrived due to lack of oversight. Agriculture, consuming nearly 90% of Iran\u2019s freshwater, continues to cultivate water-intensive crops like pistachios, wheat, and rice in arid regions, protected politically despite ecological limits. President Pezeshkian\u2019s proposal to relocate the capital to Iran\u2019s southern coast\u2014where desalinated water is more accessible\u2014has been seen as a sign of institutional failure rather than a sustainable solution. Critics argue relocation does not address root causes: entrenched corruption, agricultural overuse, or weak environmental institutions. As noted by an environmental analyst cited in The Guardian (2025), 'If the governance model stays the same, Iran will simply build another future crisis in a different location.' Tehran\u2019s crisis serves as a global warning: urban survival in the 21st century depends not on political power but on ecological humility. Major cities like Mexico City, Cape Town, and Jakarta face similar threats, underscoring that water scarcity becomes catastrophic not from drought alone, but from governmental denial and delayed adaptation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@krisnadana1997/tehrans-water-bankruptcy-a-capital-city-dying-of-political-blindness-67fa2c0bd095)\n\n**Megalopolis with 18 Million Inhabitants Faces Environmental Collapse and May Be Evacuated**\nTeher\u00e3, the capital of Iran with approximately 18 million people in its metropolitan area, is on the brink of environmental collapse due to a severe drought that has persisted for six years. Authorities warn that the city may become uninhabitable within weeks if rainfall does not return. All major reservoirs, including the Amir Kabir Dam\u2014the largest\u2014have reached critically low levels: the dam now holds only 10% of its capacity, down from 86 million cubic meters last year, sufficient for only a few more weeks of supply. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, stated that if rain does not return by year\u2019s end, the government may have to implement strict rationing and, as a last resort, evacuate the city. Water shortages are already evident: residents report dry taps at night, and some areas have no water for hours or days. Experts attribute the crisis not only to climate change and a century\u2019s worst drought but also to decades of poor water management, including over-extraction of aquifers, excessive irrigation, construction of numerous dams, and inadequate infrastructure. The result is a 'water bankruptcy'\u2014surface reserves depleted, aquifers exhausted, and recovery unlikely even with heavy rainfall. Urban sprawl, population growth, and unequal water consumption have further strained a system already operating at maximum capacity. The crisis risks triggering internal migration, social tensions, and economic disruption across agriculture, industry, and public services. While the government has announced the possibility of evacuation, experts believe this is a warning rather than a feasible plan due to the immense logistical, infrastructural, and financial challenges. Instead, the government is likely to implement strict rationing, scheduled water cuts, public conservation campaigns, industrial and domestic usage restrictions, and cloud seeding\u2014though the latter\u2019s effectiveness remains scientifically disputed. The situation in Teher\u00e3 reflects a global trend: megacities in arid regions are increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts intensified by climate change and unsustainable development. Experts stress the urgent need for long-term reforms, including rational water governance, agricultural restructuring, investment in sanitation and water recycling, and equitable access policies to prevent Teher\u00e3 from becoming a precedent of urban collapse.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 07:04 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/agenda-verde/megalopole-com-18-milhoes-de-habitantes-esta-a-beira-do-colapso-ambiental-e-pode-ser-evacuada/)\n\n**Iran's president calls for moving its drought-stricken capital amid a worsening water crisis - how Tehran got into water bankruptcy**\nIran's capital, Tehran, is facing an imminent 'Day Zero'\u2014a point at which the city could run out of water\u2014due to one of the worst droughts in decades. According to the article, rainfall has been severely below normal since 2020, with Fall 2025 being the hottest and driest on record since 1979. Key reservoirs are nearly dry, and groundwater reserves are under extreme stress. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has revived the long-debated plan to relocate the capital, framing it as a necessity rather than an option, warning that Tehran could become uninhabitable if no action is taken.

Despite efforts like the Taleqan-to-Tehran water transfer, such interbasin transfers have often fueled unsustainable growth rather than conservation. Experts, including former officials and water scientists, argue that relocating the capital is unlikely to solve the core issue of population-driven demand. Instead, they advocate for systemic reforms: shifting to less water-intensive agriculture, importing water-intensive crops, improving urban water conservation, expanding wastewater recycling, and investing in aquifer recharge and desalination.

Iran's president has acknowledged the capital may need to be relocated as water levels fall to historic lows. While drought and climate change contribute, the root cause is decades of mismanagement: unchecked urban expansion, industrial growth, and agricultural subsidies that drained aquifers, coupled with weak enforcement of environmental regulations. Unlike India and China, which have implemented traffic restrictions, factory shutdowns, cleaner fuels, and emission controls to combat pollution, Iran continues prioritizing large-scale projects for political gain over sustainable infrastructure. The lack of investment in water systems, wastewater treatment, and clean energy has created a fragile system that collapses under stress. The article warns that failing states like Iran, unable to ensure basic needs like clean air and water, become unstable, increasing regional tensions and global economic risks.

President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that if rain does not arrive by December, water rationing may be enforced, and residents might have to evacuate. Tehran's main reservoirs are critically low: Latyan Dam is at about 9% capacity, Amir Kabir Dam at roughly 8%, and in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, reservoirs are only 3% full. Around 20 provinces have received no rain since late September, and about 10% of Iran\u2019s dams are effectively dry. Experts attribute the crisis to decades of mismanagement, including over-extraction of groundwater, poorly maintained infrastructure, and massive water loss\u2014estimated at 30% of treated drinking water lost through leaky distribution systems. Climate change has intensified the drought, with a World Weather Attribution study stating that the current conditions 'would not have been possible without human-caused climate change.' The drought is now in its sixth consecutive year. Despite no official rationing, many Tehran residents report low water pressure and intermittent dry taps. Poor government communication has fueled mistrust and conspiracy theories, such as claims that foreign powers are 'stealing clouds.' Experts, including Mohsen B. Mesgaran and Kaveh Madani of the UN University\u2019s water institute, warn that Iran is in 'water bankruptcy.' The government has attempted cloud seeding, which Madani described as a 'desperate' measure to appear proactive.

President Masud Pezeshkian stated that the capital may need to be relocated if no significant rainfall occurs by winter, a concern now moving from discussion to serious consideration. The city is also sinking at a rate of 30 centimeters per year due to excessive groundwater extraction from unregulated boreholes, primarily for agricultural irrigation. This over-extraction, combined with the construction of numerous dams and reservoirs in a region with low river flow, has disrupted the hydrological balance, leading to the shutdown of a hydroelectric plant in Khuzestan due to critically low water levels. In 2024, Iran received only 3% of its normal rainfall, and one-tenth of its reservoirs are on the verge of drying out, affecting both water supply and energy production. Iran is seeking international cooperation and technological exchange, particularly with China, to address the crisis. A breakthrough technology developed by Shanghai Jiao Tong University enables atmospheric water harvesting using condensation, absorption, and heat pumps, which could work in high-temperature, low-humidity climates. Globally, freshwater reserves have sharply declined since 2014, according to a UN report and satellite data, indicating a potential shift toward a permanent dry phase. The World Bank ranks Brazil, Russia, Canada, the US, and China as the top freshwater holders, while Azerbaijan is among countries at risk of dehydration. Over the past 40\u201345 years, Azerbaijan\u2019s freshwater reserves have decreased by 25%, with the Caspian Sea level dropping by about two meters since the 1980s. Water loss in irrigation and transport systems remains high, with nearly 50% of drinking water lost during transit. Over 70% of Azerbaijan\u2019s water resources originate outside its borders, and the country holds only 15% of the South Caucasus region\u2019s total water resources\u2014less than Georgia (62%) and Armenia (23%). After the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, 14 formerly lost rivers and water bodies returned to Azerbaijan, contributing 24% of its internal water resources. The country has adopted a National Strategy for Efficient Water Use (2024\u20132040), aiming to digitize water management, implement real-time monitoring, expand modern irrigation to 10% by 2027, provide drinking water to 85% of the population and irrigation water to 90%, and reduce water losses. Experts emphasize that while global climate change cannot be halted, proper water management can prevent crisis. The Iranian situation serves as a stark warning: every drop must be conserved.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https://news.day.az/ecology/1799045.html)\n\n**Iran's president calls for moving its drought-stricken capital amid a worsening water crisis  --  how Tehran got into water bankruptcy**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has revived the long-debated proposal to relocate Tehran, the capital with a population of 15 million, due to an escalating water crisis.

President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that if rain does not arrive by December 2025, residents may need to evacuate, though experts deem this unfeasible due to economic hardship and lack of infrastructure. Main reservoirs supplying Tehran are critically low: Latyan Dam is at 9%, Amir Kabir Dam at 8%, and Sefidrud Dam near Manjil is nearly dry. Similar shortages plague Mashhad, where water levels are at only 3%. The crisis, described as 'water bankruptcy' by Kaveh Madani of the UN University, stems from decades of over-extraction, aging leaky infrastructure (with 30% of treated water lost to leaks), climate change, and water-intensive policies, including food self-sufficiency goals that have doubled irrigated farmland since 1979. Around 90% of Iran\u2019s water is used for agriculture, particularly thirsty crops like rice. Dams and wells have dried up Lake Urmia, once one of the world\u2019s largest saltwater lakes. Iran has endured six consecutive years of drought, a phenomenon unprecedented in modern times, with climate change identified as a key driver by the World Weather Attribution network. Despite cloud seeding and emergency public holidays to encourage temporary evacuations, experts stress that even if rains come, recovery will be impossible due to irreversible ecological damage. The crisis is not just environmental but increasingly intertwined with Iran\u2019s social and political future, with officials now relying on prayers for rain as a symbolic gesture. Long-term solutions require economic diversification away from water-intensive sectors, but such reforms are politically risky and unlikely to be implemented in time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 10:11 AM\nSource:[CNN International](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/01/climate/iran-water-crisis-evacuate-tehran)\n\n**Iran&#x27;s president says capital must move from Tehran over ecological concerns**\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has stated that Tehran's capital status is ecologically unsustainable due to severe water shortages and overcrowding, with the city's population reaching 9.7 million. Speaking in Qazvin, Pezeshkian emphasized that relocating the capital is no longer optional, citing ongoing drought and poor water management as critical factors. His government has proposed the underdeveloped Makran region in southeastern Iran as a potential new capital site. Pezeshkian noted that budget constraints previously prevented relocation, but now the move is unavoidable. Environmental experts, including Hassan Akhani, have warned for years that Tehran's ecological limits have been exceeded, stating 'there is nothing more we can do' as authorities ignored repeated warnings. Tehran's water supply relies on dams (normally providing 70%) and groundwater, but low rainfall and increased evaporation have reduced dam levels and strained underground reserves. Pezeshkian has previously raised the issue with Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and stressed that continued urban expansion without solving the water crisis is unsustainable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 09:12 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

Experts warn the move may not resolve the underlying 10 million-person city's water crisis, as over-extraction of groundwater since 2008 has caused aquifers to deplete rapidly\u2014losing about 1.7 billion cubic meters annually\u2014and triggered land subsidence at over 35 centimeters per year. The crisis evokes 'Day Zero' scenarios seen in Cape Town, Mexico City, Jakarta, and parts of California. While Pezeshkian's decision marks the first official proposal to relocate a capital due to ecological disaster, experts like Cornell University's Linda Shi caution that such moves are often politically motivated, with climate change used as a convenient excuse to deflect responsibility. According to Foreign Policy and the Free Iran Scholars Network, corruption and state-linked\u5229\u76ca groups, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), play a central role in unregulated well drilling, illegal water projects, and unequal water distribution. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) reports that IRGC-affiliated construction firms enjoy privileged access to water infrastructure projects, exacerbating systemic mismanagement and inequity. The relocation is estimated to cost over $100 billion, with doubts raised about Makran\u2019s suitability due to its harsh climate and difficult geography.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 02:32 PM\nSource:[Yeni Akit Gazetesi](https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/haber/iranda-yolsuzluk-su-krizine-neden-oldu-baskent-tasiniyor-1966846.html)\n\n**Environmental Collapse Is Forcing Iran to Move Its Capital**\nIran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, announced a historic and urgent plan to relocate the nation\u2019s capital from Tehran to the Makran coast near the Gulf of Oman, citing environmental collapse as the primary driver. Tehran, home to about ten million people and consuming nearly a quarter of Iran\u2019s water, is sinking due to depleted aquifers caused by prolonged drought, rising evaporation, and over-pumping of groundwater. Last year\u2019s rainfall was only 140 millimeters\u2014well below the 260-millimeter standard\u2014while this year\u2019s conditions are similarly dire. The city\u2019s dams, once supplying 70% of its water, now yield significantly less. As aquifers collapse, the land is sinking, accelerating the crisis. Pezeshkian stated, 'We no longer have a choice,' emphasizing that 'ignoring [the environment] means signing our own destruction.' This marks the first time in modern history that a capital move is driven by ecological survival rather than political or military reasons. The proposed relocation to the Makran coast, a region described as 'very prosperous and advanced,' faces immense logistical and financial challenges, with estimated costs between $77 billion and $100 billion. Two national councils are assessing the feasibility of building new coastal cities. However, the region offers limited fresh water and extreme heat, complicating long-term viability. Meanwhile, agriculture and industry account for the majority of water consumption\u2014over 90%\u2014despite government calls for a 20% household reduction. The crisis disproportionately impacts Iran\u2019s poor. Pezeshkian warned, 'Development without considering the impact on resources and expenditures will result in nothing but destruction.' Tehran, capital since 1786, now symbolizes a city that has outgrown its environment. As the ground sinks and water sources vanish, the nation faces an uncertain future: whether the relocation will succeed in time or leave millions behind in a dying capital.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[ZME Science & Technology](https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/environmental-issues/environmental-collapse-is-forcing-iran-to-move-its-capital/)\n\n**Iran&#x2019;s Capital Is Moving. The Reason Is an Ecological Catastrophe.**\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian announced that Tehran can no longer remain the capital due to a deepening ecological crisis and acute water shortage, calling it a 'perfect storm of climate change and corruption' as described by political analyst Michael Rubin. The president stated, 'We no longer have a choice,' citing decades of unsustainable groundwater extraction for urban and agricultural use, which has led to irreversible land subsidence. According to geoscientist Dar\u00edo Solano, Iran's central plateau is sinking at a rate of over 35 centimeters per year, causing aquifers to lose approximately 1.7 billion cubic meters of water annually due to permanent ground compression. This irreversible damage has severely compromised water storage capacity. As a result, Iranian officials are considering relocating the capital to the southern coast, though experts emphasize this proposal does not alleviate the immediate suffering of nearly 10 million residents in Tehran who are already experiencing the consequences of the water crisis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 08:52 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

Iranian officials are considering moving the capital to a southern coastal region. However, experts argue this move will not alleviate the ongoing water scarcity faced by nearly ten million Tehran residents, who have been suffering from decades of declining water supply. Iran has historically relocated its capital multiple times, but this would be the first instance driven by an ecological disaster. Linda Shi, a social scientist and urban planner at Cornell University, stated that while climate change is not the root cause, it serves as a convenient excuse to evade responsibility for poor political decisions. Scientists have warned since at least 2008 that uncontrolled groundwater extraction for urban and agricultural use is rapidly depleting Iran's aquifers, with an estimated loss of about 1.7 billion cubic meters of water per year. Climate change, she noted, is indeed a convenient scapegoat.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 02:35 PM\nSource:[Lighthouse @ Newquay](https://www.solidot.org/story?sid=82870)\n\n**Tehran Runs Out Of Water - Lawyers, Guns & Money**\nIran's capital, Tehran, is facing a severe water crisis due to decades of unchecked groundwater extraction for urban and agricultural use, leading to irreversible land subsidence and aquifer destruction. Scientists have warned since at least 2008 that the over-pumping was depleting underground water reserves, with Iran's central plateau sinking at a rate exceeding 35 centimeters per year. According to geoscientist Dar\u00edo Solano from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, this subsidence permanently crushes aquifers, resulting in a loss of approximately 1.7 billion cubic meters of water annually. Solano stated, 'We saw this coming.' The crisis mirrors similar 'day zero' scenarios in cities like Cape Town, Mexico City, Jakarta, and parts of California, driven by a combination of mismanagement and climate change. Despite repeated warnings, authorities have failed to curb extraction rates. President Masoud Pezeshkian reportedly informed officials last week that Tehran may need to be relocated, with the Makran coast in southern Iran suggested as a potential new site for the capital. The remaining population of Tehran would need to find alternative solutions independently.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 08:24 PM\nSource:[Lawyers, Guns & Money](https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2025/11/tehran-runs-out-of-water)\n\n**Iran's Capital Has Run Out of Water, Forcing it to Move**\nTehran, Iran's capital, is facing an existential ecological crisis due to severe water shortages, prompting officials to consider relocating the capital to the southern Makran coast. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reportedly stated, 'We no longer have a choice,' citing a 'perfect storm of climate change and corruption' as the root cause, according to Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute. Since at least 2008, over-extraction of groundwater for urban and agricultural use has caused irreversible land subsidence across Iran's central plateau, which is sinking at over 35 centimeters per year, resulting in a loss of 1.7 billion cubic meters of water annually due to permanent aquifer compaction, according to geoscientist Dar\u00edo Solano. While Tehran has historically shifted capitals\u2014such as to Isfahan, Tabriz, and Shiraz\u2014this would be the first relocation driven by an ecological catastrophe. However, experts like Linda Shi from Cornell University caution that such moves are often politically motivated, with climate change serving as a convenient scapegoat for poor governance. The proposed relocation to the remote, harsh Makran coast could cost over $100 billion and faces skepticism regarding its long-term viability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 07:54 PM\nSource:[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/irans-capital-has-run-out-of-water-forcing-it-to-move/)\n\n**Tehran on the Brink: Iran's President Calls for Relocation of Capital**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has warned that Tehran is on the brink of collapse due to severe water shortages, rapid urban expansion, and land subsidence, with the city consuming approximately 25% of the country's water resources. Speaking in Hormozgan Province on the Persian Gulf, Pezeshkian emphasized that the current crisis\u2014marked by a 50-60% reduction in rainfall (140 mm in 2024 vs. a 260 mm norm) and projected further decline to around 100 mm in 2025\u2014makes relocating the capital inevitable. He noted that groundwater levels are being dangerously depleted, causing land to sink by up to 30 cm per year in some areas, which he described as a 'catastrophe.' Traditional water sources\u201470% from dams and 30% from underground aquifers\u2014are no longer sufficient. Transporting water to Tehran could cost up to \u20ac4 per cubic meter. Pezeshkian reiterated that he had previously raised the issue with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, despite past criticism, and now insists on a scientific, long-term strategy. He highlighted the strategic advantages of southern regions like Hormozgan, including access to the sea, trade potential, and economic development. The idea of relocating the capital is not new; former President Hassan Rouhani had previously developed plans, though they were never implemented.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 04:05 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/tegeran-mezhi-visnazhennya-prezident-iranu-1759550330.html)\n\n**Iran's President Proposes Relocating Capital from Tehran Due to Water Crisis**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has proposed relocating the capital from Tehran to the southern region of Hormozgan, citing an escalating water crisis, severe groundwater subsidence, and unsustainable urban expansion. Tehran, with over 10 million residents, consumes nearly a quarter of Iran\u2019s total water supply. Pezeshkian stated that the country has no alternative but to relocate the capital, emphasizing that the current situation is unsustainable. He highlighted that rainfall in the past year was only 140 mm\u201450-60% below the 260 mm norm\u2014and projected rainfall for 2025 to be just under 100 mm. The decline in dam levels, drying wells, and rising water transport costs\u2014up to \u20ac4 per cubic meter\u2014underscore the urgency. Tehran\u2019s water supply, previously 70% from dams and 30% from groundwater, is now under extreme strain due to reduced precipitation and increased evaporation. Pezeshkian warned that unchecked development without resource consideration leads to inevitable collapse, noting that in some areas, the ground sinks by 30 cm annually\u2014a 'catastrophe' signaling the depletion of underground water. He made these remarks during a visit to Hormozgan, a coastal province on the Persian Gulf, which he described as offering access to open waters and strong economic potential. The proposal, previously discussed by past presidents including Hassan Rouhani, has drawn criticism but is now deemed necessary due to the severity of the crisis. According to The Guardian, the idea has been under consideration for years, with Rouhani even developing relocation plans.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 06:14 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/world/55401782-prezident-irana-predlozhil-perenesti-stolitsu-iz-tegerana/)\n\n**Iran President: Water Crisis Forces 'No Choice' to Relocate Capital from Tehran**\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated on October 2, 2024, during a speech in Hormozgan Province, a coastal region along the Persian Gulf, that Tehran must be relocated due to worsening water shortages, urban overexpansion, and severe land subsidence.

Tehran, with over 10 million residents, consumes nearly a quarter of Iran\u2019s total water resources. Pezeshkian reiterated that climate change, over-extraction of groundwater, and poor water management have intensified the crisis. He previously warned in July that if water conservation is not improved, Tehran\u2019s reservoirs could dry up by October.

    "summary": "Experts generally agree that Iran is experiencing an acute water and ecological crisis in Tehran, with conditions described as unprecedented and pushing the capital close to uninhabitability. Multiple fields\u2014public administration, urban planning, political science, regime theory, and Middle East studies\u2014note President Pezeshkian's repeated, explicit references to the need to relocate the capital, including mentions of possible destination regions like Makran or Hormozgan. Several factors drive up the probability of an official announcement in the next month: intense crisis pressure, the need for regime legitimacy, the existence of pre-discussed alternative sites, and the reduced barrier of just needing an announcement (not actual implementation). However, all experts emphasize strong countervailing factors: the low historical base rate for such specific capital relocation announcements, deep-seated elite resistance, bureaucratic inertia, immense financial and logistical challenges, and the frequent Iranian pattern of escalating rhetoric without formal commitment. Scenarios for a 'No' outcome cite continued emergency management and ambiguous public statements stopping short of naming a new capital, while 'Yes' scenarios imagine a bold, specific declaration catalyzed by escalating crisis or unrest, regardless of immediate feasibility. Probability estimates among forecasters range from 29% to 75%. The modal or consensus forecast clusters between 35% and 45%, indicating that while an unprecedented crisis makes a naming announcement more plausible than ever before, structural obstacles make it more likely than not that Iran will still not officially announce a new capital location by the January 3, 2026 deadline.",
