Their articulation that crossing the 5% unemployment threshold would require a multi-sigma adverse event is well-grounded in post-2000 Dutch labor market data, which has only seen such spikes during extraordinary circumstances (2009 crisis, 2020 pandemic). This forecaster strengthens the case by arguing that the ongoing increase is driven by labor force expansion rather than mass layoffs, which, from a Labor Market Analysis (ILO) perspective, sharply reduces the risk of a sudden and large spike. Furthermore, their acknowledgment of tail risk but insistence on the absence of any proximate crisis mirrors the empirical rigidity required for sound forecasting. This is not just a recitation of trend: it also underscores the structural buffering effects (policy, flexibility, welfare) which make short-term large jumps historically rare. The probability of 11% is accordingly justified, not just by trend but the rarity of policy-immune shocks in the Dutch context."

Including a specific reference to the magnitude of real GDP decline or negative output shock historically needed for unemployment to surge\u2014viewed through the Okun's Law lens\u2014would further strengthen the analytic rigor and provide a more concrete sense of the gap between current conditions and the adverse scenario required."

Their critique that a Phillips Curve model is a blunt instrument here is correct: in this highly institutionalized labor market, microdata and statistical regime changes matter more than abstract macro relationships, and precise knowledge of the CBS and Eurostat methodology is essential to accurate forecasting.

Poverty is highlighted, with 5.7\u202fmillion Italians (almost 10\u202f% of the population) living at the brink of survival, largely among \"working\u2011poor\" who cannot meet basic needs.  Industrial production fell 8.5\u202f% from mid\u20112022 to end\u20112024, blamed on U.S. tariffs and Russian sanctions that raise energy costs.

The report also finds that in 2025 the average unemployment rate for 23\u2011 to 27\u2011year\u2011olds was 4.59\u202f%, a rise of 1.34\u202fpercentage points from 2019. Among non\u2011degree holders the rate increased by 0.47\u202fpercentage points, while for older university graduates it rose by 0.38\u202fpercentage points. In the tech sector unemployment climbed from 1.98\u202f% in 2019 to 3.02\u202f% in 2025, and the largest gains were seen in arts, design, sports and media, where the rate jumped 1.77\u202fpercentage points. The article notes that half of all ChatGPT messages are sent by users aged 18\u201125, and that a pilot study found a conversational\u2011assistant in customer\u2011support raised productivity by nearly 15\u202f% on average, especially for less\u2011experienced staff. It also cites the Indeed index, which was down 36\u202f% in July\u202f2025 versus the start of 2020, and a decline in Generation\u202fZ\u2019s professional\u2011conscience score from 36 to 33 between 2015\u20112017 and 2023\u20112025.

The piece concludes that the statistical gap for 22\u2011 to 27\u2011year\u2011olds in highly AI\u2011exposed jobs is not universal or definitive, but it will likely accelerate changes in higher\u2011education curricula toward AI\u2011audit, quality\u2011control and critical\u2011thinking skills.

The trend has been stable: 4.2% in April and May, 4.1% in June, 4.2% in July, and 4.3% in August. He states, 'no estamos ante un deterioro s\u00fabito, sino ante un enfriamiento ordenado del mercado laboral.' Job vacancies (JOLTS) fell to 7.18\u202fmillion in July\u202f2025, the lowest since September\u202f2024, which should ease future wage pressures. Unemployment claims rose in September but fell back to 218,000. The Fed\u2019s September\u202f2025 SEP projects a median unemployment of 4.5% this year, converging to 4.1% long\u2011term, indicating confidence in a gradual adjustment. The analyst projects unemployment between 4.4\u20134.6% in the coming quarters; if it rises >0.5\u202fpercentage point above the recent low, the Fed may act more aggressively, prioritizing employment. Conversely, if wages rise and inflation stalls, a pause or reversal could occur. He recommends investors monitor U\u20113, U\u20116, JOLTS, non\u2011farm payrolls, unemployment duration, weekly claims, and SEP projections, calling unemployment the main thermometer for monetary policy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 09:42 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/analysis/esta-el-desempleo-marcando-el-rumbo-de-la-fed-200478887)\n\n**Numbers Do Not Lie: Why the AfD Leads in the Ruhr Region's Runoff**\nThe article reports that the AfD has advanced candidates in the second round of municipal elections in the Ruhr region, with wins in Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen and Hagen. It cites unemployment data: 280,604 people were registered as unemployed in May\u202f2025, a rise of 14,470 (5.4\u202f%) compared to the previous month. Unemployment rates were highest in Gelsenkirchen (14.9\u202f%) and Duisburg (13.3\u202f%) and lowest in Hagen (12.4\u202f%). The piece notes that 5.98\u202fmillion residents in NRW have a migration background, representing 44.5\u202f% of the population in 2022, up from 30.8\u202f% in 2019. The unemployment rate for people with a migration background was 19.1\u202f% in 2022, three times higher than the 5.7\u202f% rate for German nationals, according to the NRW labour\u2011market report 2023. The article quotes the headline \u2018Die Zahlen l\u00fcgen nicht\u2019 and attributes the AfD\u2019s success to economic hardship and integration challenges. It also reports that 36\u202f% of voters cited the economy as the most important issue, followed by integration and immigration, while only 19\u202f% considered environmental protection decisive.

In August 2025, the unemployment rate for 16\u201124\u2011year\u2011olds not in school rose to 18.9%, the highest in 20 months after a change in statistical methodology (source: State Statistics Bureau, 17\u202fSep\u202f2025).

The slowdown in hiring is expected to prompt the Federal Reserve to reduce borrowing costs, with markets broadly pricing in a cumulative 1\u202fpercentage\u2011point rate cut by September\u202f2026.  Fed Chair Jerome\u202fPowell already announced the first rate cut of the year and noted that the labor market can no longer be described as \u2018very robust\u2019, signalling heightened concern about employment prospects.  Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke\u202fTilley added that a weak labor market, job losses and sluggish services spending will outweigh tariff impacts, leading the Fed to make several cuts between the end of 2025 and early 2026.  The survey also projects that core PCE inflation\u2014excluding food and energy\u2014will peak at 3.2\u202f% in Q4\u202f2024 and only begin to decline in the second half of 2026.  GDP is expected to grow 1.2\u202f% in Q4\u202f2024, with overall growth remaining below 2\u202f% in 2025 due to the dampening effect of a weak labor market on household spending.  Despite these challenges, the second\u2011quarter GDP growth was the fastest in two years, driven by resilient consumer and business\u2011investment activity, according to the latest BEA data.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 01:10 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The report also finds that in 2025 the average unemployment rate for 23\u2011 to 27\u2011year\u2011olds was 4.59\u202f%, a rise of 1.34\u202fpercentage points from 2019. Among non\u2011degree holders the rate increased by 0.47\u202fpercentage points, while for older university graduates it rose by 0.38\u202fpercentage points. In the tech sector unemployment climbed from 1.98\u202f% in 2019 to 3.02\u202f% in 2025, and the largest gains were seen in arts, design, sports and media, where the rate jumped 1.77\u202fpercentage points. The article notes that half of all ChatGPT messages are sent by users aged 18\u201125, and that a pilot study found a conversational\u2011assistant in customer\u2011support raised productivity by nearly 15\u202f% on average, especially for less\u2011experienced staff. It also cites the Indeed index, which was down 36\u202f% in July\u202f2025 versus the start of 2020, and a decline in Generation\u202fZ\u2019s professional\u2011conscience score from 36 to 33 between 2015\u20112017 and 2023\u20112025. Finally, a 2024 survey reports that Generation\u202fZ expects a \u201csuccessful\u201d salary of $588\u202f000 per year, compared with $270\u202f000 for earlier generations. The piece concludes that the statistical gap for 22\u2011 to 27\u2011year\u2011olds in highly AI\u2011exposed jobs is not universal or definitive, but it will likely accelerate changes in higher\u2011education curricula toward AI\u2011audit, quality\u2011control and critical\u2011thinking skills.

The trend has been stable: 4.2% in April and May, 4.1% in June, 4.2% in July, and 4.3% in August. He states, 'no estamos ante un deterioro s\u00fabito, sino ante un enfriamiento ordenado del mercado laboral.' Job vacancies (JOLTS) fell to 7.18\u202fmillion in July\u202f2025, the lowest since September\u202f2024, which should ease future wage pressures. Unemployment claims rose in September but fell back to 218,000. The Fed\u2019s September\u202f2025 SEP projects a median unemployment of 4.5% this year, converging to 4.1% long\u2011term, indicating confidence in a gradual adjustment. The analyst projects unemployment between 4.4\u20134.6% in the coming quarters; if it rises >0.5\u202fpercentage point above the recent low, the Fed may act more aggressively, prioritizing employment. Conversely, if wages rise and inflation stalls, a pause or reversal could occur. He recommends investors monitor U\u20113, U\u20116, JOLTS, non\u2011farm payrolls, unemployment duration, weekly claims, and SEP projections, calling unemployment the main thermometer for monetary policy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 09:42 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/analysis/esta-el-desempleo-marcando-el-rumbo-de-la-fed-200478887)\n\n**STAYING SANGUINE ABOUT THE HORIZON**\nTom Barkin, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, delivered a speech on September\u202f26\u202f2025 in which he explained the Fed\u2019s current economic outlook and policy stance. He noted that inflation has remained above the Fed\u2019s 2\u202f% target, with a headline rate of 2.7\u202f% and core inflation at 2.9\u202f% (the monthly increase in August was 2.8\u202f% annualized). He highlighted that the labor market is under downward pressure: the three\u2011month average job growth was only 29,000, the hiring rate is near Great Recession lows, and the unemployment rate has risen to 4.3\u202f%. Barkin argued that the labor supply is shrinking\u2014border crossings have fallen and the number of people over 65 leaving the workforce has risen by an average of 1.3\u202fmillion per year\u2014while demand remains solid, partly buoyed by recent tax\u2011bill stimulus and continued consumer spending. He also pointed to improving productivity, driven by automation and AI, as a countervailing force that could temper inflation. Barkin concluded that the Fed\u2019s recent 25\u2011basis\u2011point rate cut to just over 4\u202f% represents a move toward a more neutral stance, aiming to balance the twin mandates of price stability and maximum employment. He emphasized that, despite the \u201cshaky ground\u201d of the current economic environment, focusing on the horizon can provide a more stable path forward.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[InsuranceNewsNet](https://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/staying-sanguine-about-the-horizon)\n\n**Dutch unemployment rises to 3.9% in August: CBS**\nIn August\u202f2025 the Dutch Employee Insurance Agency ('UWV') recorded 187,400 active unemployment (WW) benefits, a slight increase of 200 from July.

Female employment is on the rise, with an increase in job applications. Experts attribute this to the transition periods in the labor market and the growing prevalence of contract-based work. Seasonal fluctuations in agriculture, food, and construction sectors The demand for labor in the agriculture, food, and construction sectors has increased. This rise is linked to seasonal factors, particularly the peak period of outdoor activities in spring and summer.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts, across diverse disciplines (labor market analysis, macroeconomics, economics, political science, and European labor market integration), converge on a low probability\u201411%\u2014that the Dutch unemployment rate will rise above 5% in any month of 2025. Their consensus rests on several recurring themes:\n\n1. **Current Data and Base Rate**: As of August 2025, the Dutch unemployment rate is 3.9%, up only slightly over the year, with most increases due to more labor force entrants rather than mass layoffs. Historically, Dutch unemployment only breached 5% during major crises (e.g., 2009 global financial crisis, 2020 COVID-19), and in normal years, strong labor market institutions and policies have kept the rate well below this threshold.\n\n2. **Structural and Institutional Resilience**: The Netherlands has a flexible labor market, active labor market policies, generous social safety nets, and quick policy responses\u2014features repeatedly identified as buffers that make sharp spikes in unemployment unlikely absent a major shock.\n\n3. **Recent Trends and Influencing Factors**: Factors such as incremental increases due to higher participation (e.g., more women and older people entering the workforce) are not seen as causes for sharp jumps. Macroeconomic headwinds and sectoral risks are acknowledged, but there's no present or forecasted trigger in news or data that could provoke a rapid rise to above 5%.\n\n4. **Shock/Yes Scenarios**: All experts agree that only an extraordinary, acute external shock (global/Eurozone recession, severe energy crisis, or massive trade dislocation) could push Dutch unemployment above 5%. There is no evidence of such a shock occurring or impending for the remainder of 2025.\n\n5. **Summary Probability and Rationale**: The likelihood is rated low (11%) across all forecasters, reflecting a small nod to tail risk but overwhelming evidence from base rates, current trends, and institutional stability that surpassing the 5% mark is very unlikely in 2025.\n\nIn sum: Absent a severe and currently unforeseeable negative event, Dutch unemployment is expected to remain well below 5% in every month of 2025 according to all expert analyses.",
