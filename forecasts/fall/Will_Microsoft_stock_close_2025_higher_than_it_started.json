However, the risk flagged by The Economist\u2014regarding a widespread downward revision of depreciation schedules and earnings quality\u2014cannot be ignored. While a full-scale reset is unlikely in Q4 absent regulatory or audit compulsion, even partial increases in capex amortization could dampen near-term EPS.

Macro tailwinds (lower rates) and analyst bullishness help counterbalance. Using historical base rates, S&P 500 mega-cap tech stocks have closed a calendar year higher more than 60% of the time in recent history. Adjusting downward for elevated valuations and previously detailed accounting risks, my best estimate is moderately below the base rate\u2014especially given the contest's scoring setup and need for credible justification of a less-than-even chance. I set the forecast at 23% for MSFT closing above $421.50, justifying a contrarian but well-supported stance based on (a) unusually acute earnings model risk, (b) valuation fatigue warnings in financial commentary, and (c) risk of profit-taking after huge AI-driven gains.",

The excitement over AI and the magnitude of MSFT's run-up creates a setup where even a modest negative surprise\u2014especially one that impairs perceived earnings quality\u2014could prompt a rapid re-pricing, disproportional given the vast market capitalization involved. Also, while the base rate for a positive annual return is high, it does not account for regime changes in narrative or valuation. Your argument for higher-than-normal downside risk due to the specific, unresolved debate regarding depreciation, coupled with evidence of some incremental capital rotation, is a credible reason for a low but defensible probability assessment."

While it's true that base rates favor mega tech ending strong years higher, those base rates may be less predictive when a very specific and credible tail risk\u2014like a forced revision of depreciation schedules potentially lopping hundreds of billions off sector market cap\u2014is well-flagged and circulating among institutional investors. Factor models would assign a significant negative stress to even a modest accounting-driven derating, regardless of longer-term secular growth. Additionally, current crowding in AI/tech, and recent analyst comments hinting at upside being priced in, could result in any negative sector shock triggering disproportionately large nominal moves. Thus, a probability near two-thirds understates the scenario-weighted downside risk, which in current conditions warrants a more tempered forecast despite no imminent trigger."

While Microsoft's AI/cloud tailwinds and business momentum are undeniable, the risk that you highlight regarding depreciation schedules is significant and underappreciated in most standard models. This is especially relevant as sector-wide revision of asset life assumptions is the kind of exogenous shock that the tech mega-cap regime has not recently faced at this scale. The fundamental approach correctly notes that, despite strong top-line momentum, even a modest hit to reported profitability could rapidly compress a rich multiple\u2014especially with widespread awareness catalyzed by credible media coverage (e.g., The Economist). Additionally, the consensus bullish posture in analyst commentary is more about durability than outsized further upside, while other AI infrastructure players are increasingly seen as better risk/reward by market participants, limiting Microsoft's positional advantage. Your explicit accounting for these factors, rather than overfitting to recent earnings momentum, shows a commendable discipline\u2014your probability is appropriately cautious and illustrative of the importance of fat-tail risk recognition in this environment."

The monetary-policy transmission argument highlights an essential nuance: while liquidity and central bank posture are classically supportive for equities, these factors lose marginal efficacy when mega-cap valuations are compressed by novel, company-specific tail risks. You also correctly anchor on the almost binary nature of a forced accounting policy change\u2014one that would cut through the median base rate for annual mega-cap tech gains, regardless of momentum or positive macro backdrop. Several historical episodes illustrate that even a liquidity-rich market can rerate a crowded sector sharply when a new, widely identified risk crystallizes. Your approach also respects the EMH's requirement to adjust for risks as soon as they become widely known among sophisticated market participants, rather than assuming regime persistence purely from trailing data. In sum, your probability is defensibly low in light of current narrative, risk environment, and the structural limitations of monetary policy in offsetting idiosyncratic accounting shocks."

You also properly weight Microsoft's operational excellence and secular tailwind in AI/cloud, while recognizing that even strong cash-flow growth projections can be rendered moot in the short run if GAAP numbers are sharply revised downward. Furthermore, your reasoning acknowledges that while base rates for tech up-years are favorable, the current combination of high valuation, sector crowding, and a specific, plausible left-tail event justifies a significant downward adjustment. This nuanced handling of both structural bullishness and discrete accounting risks strikes a defensible middle path\u2014not as bearish as the most risk-sensitive probabilists, but far from complacently bullish.

First, even best-in-class incumbents can suffer disproportionately if there is a sudden reversal in crowding or narrative after a long run of outperformance (as the tech bubble's turn showed). The persistent recirculation of accounting/depreciation concerns\u2014not just as a hidden tail risk but as an increasingly salient topic within the analyst and media community\u2014creates the real potential for self-fulfilling panic or at least an abrupt de-risking, precisely because the belief that 'large-caps almost never suffer big unexpected drawdowns' is broadly held. Additionally, valuation anchoring and FOMO can create a stretched rubber band: as soon as the prevailing story is even modestly challenged, behavioral impulses (herding, loss aversion) can accelerate selling well beyond what a fundamental or sector-structure model would expect. Therefore, a near-even probability does not adequately reflect the degree to which MSFT's outcome might be binary and driven by the resolution or escalation of this narrative well before year-end."

Your recognition that newly appreciated, sector-specific accounting risks\u2014such as abrupt changes to depreciation policy\u2014can trigger repricing even amid strong macro liquidity directly addresses how new, widely discussed information is digested by markets. In economic business cycle theory, even when aggregate monetary conditions are supportive, significant idiosyncratic risks can cause large, rapid valuation adjustments if investors collectively reassess future earnings quality. Your approach wisely discounts the historical bias for annual gains in mega-cap tech, applying the EMH\u2019s discipline that 'risks known to the market' mean current prices reflect a precarious equilibrium, especially at historic valuations and following a major advance. Your forecast therefore robustly encapsulates both market efficiency and risk-awareness, and provides a necessary counterweight to more momentum-driven or optimistic views."

While looser liquidity and robust economic data often lift all large caps, the unique risk of a forced sector-wide accounting change (on server depreciation) is precisely the sort of exogenous shock that can overwhelm otherwise positive transmission mechanics. You rightly recognize that while monetary conditions create headwinds or tailwinds, their impact is not uniform when there is a single-issue narrative overhang\u2014especially as flagged by reputable sources and picked up by institutional investors. Your reasoning is also aligned with monetary theory in that markets are forward-looking: as soon as this risk becomes non-trivial and cannot be resolved before year-end, price support from monetary easing is blunted. As a result, you appropriately discount the base rate from 50%-plus to a much lower figure, demonstrating how sector-specific shocks can quickly short-circuit the usual effects of transmission mechanisms in asset pricing."

Several experts correctly point out that typical factor/momentum models and base rates are not well equipped to anticipate low-probability, high-impact accounting shocks, particularly for mega-cap names. Additionally, evidence suggests tech crowding is elevated, and there is market chatter indicating the depreciation story is increasingly priced in as a credible risk. Although fundamental/sectoral momentum still moderately favor MSFT closing above its Jan open, the distribution of outcomes is materially 'fatter-tailed' on the downside than pure quant or history-weighted models project.

The points regarding risk of mean reversion, crowding, and behavioral overconfidence at these valuation levels (from both Behavioral Finance and CCA participants) reinforce that any negative shock\u2014particularly a sectorwide accounting event\u2014could trigger abrupt selling pressure on megacap tech. While the quantitative and macro participants lean more bullish, even their strongest arguments concede that this regime is unusually vulnerable to external shocks that may not be quantified by historical return distributions.

Most forecasts clustering at 23% (EMH, behavioral, comparable analysis, monetary policy, fundamental analysis) demonstrate convergent reasoning, each from a distinct perspective, that this risk is not yet fully reflected in pricing or sentiment. While a few arguments introduce a slightly higher base rate due to the robustness of Microsoft's business model and typical market seasonality, the presence of acute, recognized tail risk (and ongoing debate about accounting) justifies a continued contrarian stance.

Furthermore, the sector\u2019s crowding, historically high valuation, and visible profit-taking/rotation into other AI names reinforce the asymmetric risk profile.

Multiple peers cautioned that historical base rates are less predictive when such specific, credible, and non-macroeconomic risks are present. The fact that at least half of the well-supported forecasts cluster around 23-33% reflects a consensus that risk-adjusted odds are well below the macro or cycle-find base rates. The behavioral critique is particularly weighty: after a massive run-up and heavy crowding, any hit to narrative or earnings quality\u2014even if not fundamental to Microsoft's long-term prospects\u2014could cascade through sentiment, making downside resolution disproportionately likely.

The more bullish perspectives (quantitative factor, macroeconomic cycle theory, and technology sector analysis) highlight robust momentum and macro/sectoral strength, but their lower weighting of this idiosyncratic risk renders their higher probabilities less persuasive in my risk-management framework.

It cites Gartner\u2019s estimate that worldwide spending on hardware and software nudged $1trn last year and is projected to double to $2trn by 2026, with the five firms expected to spend over $1trn on capital investments between 2024 and 2026.  Nvidia and Broadcom, whose combined market capitalisation is $6trn, are forecast to book almost $1trn in sales over that period.  The piece notes that Microsoft moved its server depreciation from four to six years in 2022, Alphabet did the same in 2023, Amazon and Oracle from five to six years in 2024, and Meta from five to five\u2011half years in January 2025; Amazon later reversed to five years, cutting 2025 operating profit by $700m (\u22481\u202f%).

(Hint: Oracle's Not One)**\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL) announced a projection that its cloud infrastructure revenue would rise to $144\u202fbillion over the next five years, a figure largely secured by non\u2011cancellable contracts.  Despite the headline\u2011making stock surge, the author argues that Oracle is unlikely to be the biggest beneficiary of its own cloud push because the company carries a heavy debt load, generates no free cash flow, and will need to spend heavily on capital expenditures to capture the projected revenue.  The article notes that the economics of the forecasted revenue are uncertain and that the three dominant cloud providers\u2014Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL/GOOG)\u2014have largely opted out of pursuing this opportunity.  Instead, Oracle is expected to build data centers for them.  Consequently, the author identifies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) as the two companies better positioned to benefit from Oracle\u2019s spending spree.  Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI infrastructure is highlighted by its 94\u202f% market share in the GPU space in Q2, a 56\u202f% surge in data\u2011center revenue to $41.1\u202fbillion, and a nearly doubled $7.3\u202fbillion in networking equipment sales.  Nvidia\u2019s competitive moat is built on its CUDA software platform and NVLink interconnect system, which enable developers to program GPUs for AI workloads and allow multiple GPUs to operate as a cohesive unit.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 07:35 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

In Q2, revenue rose 48% to $1\u202fbillion, and U.S. commercial sales nearly doubled, up 93% to $306\u202fmillion. The U.S. government remains its largest customer, with a $10\u202fbillion Army contract and a recent ICE deal. The article notes Palantir trades at high multiples, warning that execution risk could hurt the stock, but the opportunity is large. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) uses AI to improve content recommendations and advertising. Q2 advertising revenue grew 22% to $46.6\u202fbillion, and Meta is expanding ads on WhatsApp and Threads. CEO Mark Zuckerberg aims for Meta to lead in 'personal superintelligence' and is investing heavily in AI talent. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) integrated AI copilots into Microsoft\u202f365 and saw a 16% revenue jump last quarter; its Azure cloud revenue rose 39% last quarter, though capacity constraints limited growth. Microsoft is investing in GPUs and servers for AI workloads and sees quantum computing as a future growth driver.

The article was published on August\u202f28\u202f2025 by The Motley Fool.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 08:40 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/28/3-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-worth-consider/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=9be3680c-37f5-488e-b17e-386acf57b0fc)\n\n**Prediction: This Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be Worth More Than Apple and Microsoft Combined by 2030 | The Motley Fool**\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are the second\u2011 and third\u2011largest companies on the market, valued at $3.9\u202ftrillion and $3.4\u202ftrillion respectively. To surpass their combined value, a company would need a market cap of $7.3\u202ftrillion by 2030. The author identifies Nvidia (NVDA) as the only plausible candidate, arguing that its AI\u2011driven GPU business and the continued spending of AI hyperscalers could drive Nvidia past that threshold. 'I think that a $7.3\u202ftrillion market cap is achievable for Nvidia by 2030,' the article states. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are the preferred hardware for AI workloads, and hyperscalers such as Alphabet and Meta are increasing capital expenditures\u2014Alphabet raised its 2025 cap\u2011ex projection to $85\u202fbillion, and Meta expects 'significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026' for building out its computing capacity. A third\u2011party estimate cited at Nvidia\u2019s 2025 GTC event puts global data\u2011center cap\u2011ex at $400\u202fbillion in 2024, projected to reach $1\u202ftrillion by 2028, implying a compounded annual growth rate of about 26\u202f%. Using that CAGR, Nvidia\u2019s revenue would grow from $149\u202fbillion to $335\u202fbillion and profits from roughly $74\u202fbillion (mid\u201150\u202f% margin) to $184\u202fbillion over the next 3\u00bd\u202fyears. Applying a forward P/E of 40, the model projects a market cap of $7.36\u202ftrillion by 2028, already exceeding the 2030 target. The article concludes that Nvidia is poised to remain dominant and that its stock will be a must\u2011own for investors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 09:15 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/21/prediction-this-supercharged-artificial-intelligen/)\n\n**US Stocks Open Higher on Strong Tech Gains**\nUS stocks opened higher on Thursday, driven by strong tech gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Index opened 1.13% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 0.66% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.19%. Microsoft and Meta Platforms shares surged after both companies reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Microsoft rose 5% and Meta rose 12%, boosting optimism in the broader technology sector. Microsoft's earnings came after the software giant reported a profit of $3.65 per share in the fourth quarter, beating analyst estimates of $3.37 per share. The company also announced that its Azure cloud computing service generated $75 billion in revenue, exceeding its strong position in the growing cloud infrastructure market. Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, rose sharply after it provided an optimistic outlook for third-quarter revenue, forecasting between $47.5 and $50.5 billion, significantly above analyst estimates of $46.16 billion. The positive forecast suggests continued strength in digital advertising and engagement on its platforms. Investors are now waiting for results from other Mag-7 components, including Apple and Amazon, which will report after the closing bell on Thursday. Markets are digesting the Fed's pause and inflation data. The market reaction followed a mixed session on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed lower on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a slight gain. The market reaction came after the US central bank held its benchmark interest rate in its July meeting, keeping it in a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, the decision was not unanimous, with Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller dissenting, indicating a growing split within the central bank. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that no monetary policy changes were made for September, and future steps will depend on data. The inflation data released on Thursday made inflation outlooks even more complex. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation indicator, rose 2.6% in the year-over-year comparison in June, slightly above the estimate of 2.5% from economists polled by Dow Jones. Weekly jobless claims for the week ending July 26 came in at 218,000, just below the expected 222,000. Market strategist Ross Mayfield, investment analyst at Baird, noted that current valuations are 'overdone' and that recent Fed comments could lead to a short-term consolidation. 'There are many good things already priced in, so I think small things at the margin can have a bigger impact when you've had a run like this,' he told CNBC. Trade tensions and stock movements also played a role. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that talks with China over tariffs are progressing, and both sides 'have the stuff of a deal.' No details or timeline were provided, but the current ceasefire for aggressive tariffs is set to expire on August 12. In other corporate news, Ford Motor's stock fell on Thursday. The automaker announced that its 2025 profit forecast includes a net headwind of $2 billion related to tariffs, resulting in a negative EBIT effect of $3 billion, partially offset by recovery measures of $1 billion.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 08:45 AM\nSource:[Invezz - German](https://invezz.com/de/news/2025/07/31/us-aktien-eroffnen-dank-starker-tech-gewinne-hoher/)\n\n**Meta and Microsoft drive Nasdaq to new highs**\nMeta and Microsoft have given the final push to the Nasdaq record, with the technology index reaching new highs after Microsoft's battle to join the club of $4 billion companies. The Nasdaq closed July as the best-performing index globally, with a 5% increase, while the S&P 500 rose by over 3% and the Dow Jones by less than 1%. The technology sector has been the main driver of the rally in July, with Meta and Microsoft being the stars of the show after presenting better-than-expected results. Meta's stock rose by over 12% after announcing a 35% increase in profits in the last quarter, reaching $35 billion, thanks to the boost from artificial intelligence. Microsoft also beat expectations, with a 15% increase in profits and revenues, making it the second company to surpass the $4 billion mark, after Nvidia. 'The cloud and artificial intelligence are the engine of business transformation in all industries and sectors,' said Satya Nadella, Microsoft's president and CEO. Apple showed a flat performance, awaiting the announcement of its results, while Amazon rose by 2%.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 10:31 PM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/mercados/2025/08/01/688be8c5e5fdea35138b457f.html)\n\n**Microsoft Surpasses $4 Trillion in Market Capitalization as AI Optimism Drives Market Gains**\nMicrosoft has surpassed $4 trillion in market capitalization, becoming the second publicly traded company in history to achieve this milestone. The company's quarterly results exceeded expectations, driven by its investments in artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices reached new historic highs, fueled by gains in major technology stocks. Meta Platforms and Nvidia also reported significant gains, with Meta's stock rising 12.1% to a new high and Nvidia's stock increasing over 1%. The Federal Reserve maintained its interest rate, with Chairman Jerome Powell stating that it's 'too early' to discuss a rate cut in September. The market is now focused on the upcoming employment report, which will provide a clearer picture of salary trends and hiring activity. The optimism around AI has driven the third consecutive monthly gain in all major indices, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for their third consecutive positive month, and the Nasdaq Composite poised for its best monthly performance since March 2024.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 03:48 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/it/notizie/2025/07/31/microsoft-supera-i-4-trilioni-di-dollari-mentre-il-boom-dellintelligenza-artificiale-porta-il-nasdaq-e-lsp-500-a-nuovi-record/)\n\n**Wall Street Opens Higher with Meta and Microsoft**\nThe New York Stock Exchange opened higher on Thursday, driven by the technology sector, following record profits from Meta and Microsoft, which have strengthened bets on artificial intelligence (AI). Meta Platforms rose 12.34% after announcing a revenue forecast for the current quarter significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations, thanks to AI-enhanced advertising activity. Microsoft jumped 6.42%, surpassing the $4 trillion market capitalization threshold, after releasing a better-than-expected quarterly revenue report. The Windows publisher announced a record investment forecast of $30 billion for the current quarter and reported sales exceeding expectations for its Azure cloud computing activity. These financial releases overshadowed the day's indicators. US consumer prices accelerated to 2.6% year-over-year in June, above expectations, following the Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision to maintain the status quo. Market attention now shifts to the official monthly report on job creation, unemployment, and wages, due on Friday, which also coincides with the deadline set by Donald Trump for trade negotiations on tariffs.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 02:29 PM\nSource:[Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/actualites/wall-street-ouvre-en-hausse-avec-meta-et-microsoft-59848ed784ce9595d70cb06cf75ab366)\n\n**US Stocks Open Higher on Strong Tech Gains**\nUS stocks opened higher on Thursday, driven by strong tech gains.

The company has experienced significant growth over the last decade, with its annual advertising revenue increasing from $11.5 billion in 2014 to $161 billion in 2024, driven by strong execution and major acquisitions, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus.

    "summary": "The majority of forecasting experts express caution regarding Microsoft's prospects for closing 2025 above its starting price of $421.50. Most forecasts cite robust fundamentals\u2014strong AI/cloud growth, leading Azure performance, macro tailwinds like anticipated Fed rate cuts, and continued positive market sentiment\u2014as reasons to expect stability or modest appreciation. However, several experts (Equity Research, Comparable Company Analysis, Efficient Market Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance, Monetary Policy Transmission, and Fundamental Analysis) highlight significant downside risks, particularly the potential for an accounting-driven profit shock if Microsoft (and peers) are forced to accelerate depreciation of data center/capital expenditures. They also note sector rotation risks, elevated valuations, and vulnerability to macro/exogenous shocks (e.g., trade, politics, or unexpected Fed actions). These risks, though not guaranteed to materialize, are newly salient and pernicious given the magnitude of recent AI-driven gains. As a result, most forecasts cluster at a relatively low 23% probability of MSFT closing the year higher, despite the fact that large-cap tech stocks historically end years positively more often than not. Two experts, approaching from more macro/portfolio theory and business cycle perspectives, are more optimistic, setting probabilities at 65% and 66%, respectively; another (Tech Sector Analysis) is modestly positive at 58%. Contrarians justify their cautious or even sub-base-rate probabilities due to heightened tail risks and the possibility that current optimism is already reflected in price. Across all analyses, the balance of sentiment is unexpectedly measured\u2014acknowledging strong structural drivers but emphasizing elevated, nontrivial risk of a late-year drawdown from accounting, valuation, or macro shocks. There is consensus that Microsoft is fundamentally sound and likely to persist as a market leader, but current price levels are seen as fragile in the face of several plausible negative catalysts.",
