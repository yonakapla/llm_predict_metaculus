The one major risk is that the recent sharp correction\u2014involving sizable liquidations and the unwinding of the 'Trump bump'\u2014may not be over, but with structural flows (ETF, pension, treasury) and an increasingly harmonized regulatory backdrop, the probability of a catastrophic selloff below $93.4k and sustained there is moderate-to-low. The market is showing maturing characteristics, with volatility events not causing year-long bear markets as in 2018 or 2022. Current technicals (post-liquidation, no sign of full trend reversal), sentiment (constructive), and macro (easing, innovation, and regulatory thaw) all support the case for a positive annual close. Allowing for the modest but persistent risk of further drawdowns and the inherently volatile nature of crypto, a probabilistic estimate should be bold but not extreme.

Critically, the underlying market structure has changed: global regulation (esp. US/UK) is now tilted strongly positive, ETF and pension capital is more 'sticky', and the US appears invested (even literally via its 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve') in the digital asset ecosystem's success and stability. Unlike earlier cycles, there is less existential risk of bans or a regulatory rug-pull, which historically signaled catastrophic bear markets. Macro and technical risks remain (there could be a deeper correction, and history themes suggest complacency near all-time highs), but barring a major economic/crisis shock, it is unlikely these offer enough force to pull BTC below the threshold.

China and Japan remain active via OTC flows and treasuries, Hong Kong's regulatory uncertainty has not yet deterred strategic allocations, and Korea continues to see active crypto participation.

Yet, Bitcoin's liquidity profile is globally networked: late-year risk-off events in Asian equity or FX markets, or regulatory surprises (particularly in Hong Kong or Korea, which historically can move quickly), could catalyze further unwinding by Asian whales and corporates\u2014participants who are less 'sticky' than pension or ETF flows.

For instance, should macro liquidity tighten unexpectedly (e.g., due to a sharp reversal in Fed policy, global credit contraction, or a systemic risk event), historical evidence suggests even strong structural floors can be pierced as forced selling or capital flights overwhelm institutional 'sticky' flows. In prior cycles, periods classified as robust by network or distributed-systems analysis still suffered swift multi-week drawdowns in response to such exogenous shocks. While the distributed nature of Bitcoin infrastructure limits single-point systemic risk, the asset\u2019s price remains highly cross-correlated with broader macro liquidity\u2014and a three-month window leaves room for global policy surprise.

In the near term, technical triggers\u2014such as breaking key support levels (e.g., the rising 100-day or 200-day moving average, or the $100k psychological round number)\u2014can catalyze sharp, self-reinforcing corrections irrespective of long-term cryptographic integrity. Additionally, major technical corrections often unfold rapidly and can briefly overshoot fundamental, on-chain, or macro-derived fair values. This means that even in structurally bullish environments, transient bear raids are possible and have occurred in other upcycles, especially when leverage remains high after a blow-off top. While your base-rate weighting is justified, integrating technical signals would refine the probability estimate and capture the outsized short-term moves that often define Bitcoin's year-end closes. The upshot: technical structure should not be neglected, even with robust cryptographic underpinnings and favorable institutional trends."

Moreover, the technical picture can rapidly reverse based on exogenous (and often non-chart-driven) events that institutional and regulatory structures help buffer against. Therefore, while your caution is warranted for intrayear volatility, it should be further contextualized by the deep liquidity, immutability, and anti-fragile qualities conferred by both the protocol and the current regulatory landscape\u2014factors that sharply limit the impact of classic technical breakdowns in the Q4 context."

Distributed technical stability ensures network liveness and reduces internal collapse risks, but price is still functionally coupled to broader credit, liquidity, and global risk sentiment\u2014even when embedded in apparently 'sticky' institutional vehicles. The parallels you draw to prior rapid crypto drawdowns during external credit events are apt: Bitcoin\u2019s technical distribution of risk helps in relative terms, but not absolutely, should broader macro tides turn against all high-volatility assets. Thus, your emphasis on integrating macro-monetary stress with network-based perspective highlights a real source of tail risk that should inform any confident or extreme prediction. Our perspectives combine to caution against disregarding these broader financial dynamics even as systemic technical reliability grows."

While tail risks (global macro, regulatory shocks, or a major market event) remain, the probability that such a sequence produces a >17% drawdown and sub-$93k close before year-end looks somewhat overstated in my initial risk band.

No compelling arguments emerged suggesting major new systemic downside risks, and the base rate for post-regulatory-break years closing positive remains historically robust. However, the volatility regime and macrosensitive risk tail remain present, as all agree, so full extremity (e.g., 90+%) is only justified if the correction is confirmed as merely a healthy reset.

However, my critique of 'Finance (Asset Pricing Models)' reaffirms a modest degree of region-specific risk underappreciated in some forecasts: Asian markets and regulatory actors (Hong Kong, Korea, Japan) can introduce unique Q4 volatility not fully absorbed by global models, and Asian OTC flows can exacerbate major moves, even if the US remains stable. On the other hand, the defenses of regulatory and regional factors from other experts persuade me not to overstate this risk. Weighing the group\u2019s high confidence (mostly 85\u201392%), the strong structure but the persistence of inherent volatility and some Asian tail risks, I see a minor adjustment is fitting: nudging higher, but not fully matching the most bullish views.

Critiques remind me to remain vigilant about global, not just US, sources of risk\u2014especially Asian market shocks or regulatory surprises\u2014but these appear as tail risks rather than probable events. Conversely, certain on-chain data, Asian adoption, and technical patterns suggest the post-correction support is even more robust than my original probability implied. The consensus probability is tightly grouped in the upper 80s to low 90s, and my EMH-informed approach, which places extra weight on the status quo, is further validated. In light of all this, I see a slight rationale to raise my forecast by one point, both acknowledging the strong empirical and multi-domain base rate and the reaffirmed resilience after recent liquidations.

Notably, the on-chain analytics forecaster argued that my 15-20% tail risk might overstate downside potential, citing observable real-time frictions, institutional anchoring, and reduced fragility, which are convincing points favoring a small upward adjustment. At the same time, perspectives focused on regional flows (East Asia) and behavioral/technical risks urge modest caution, as Bitcoin's volatility, reflexivity, and potential for further deleveraging cannot be discounted entirely. On balance, incorporating more evidence of institutional stickiness, strong global regulatory support, historical record of post-breakout resilience, and base rates, I am persuaded to slightly increase my probability.

Conversely, defense of the regulatory/institutional regime shift confirms that a further major drawdown to sub-$93k is a genuine tail risk but unlikely absent a global \u2018risk off\u2019 event.

Regional risks from Asia and behavioral or macro volatility were well-noted in critiques but still appear to not alter the core status quo probability in a substantive way, given the magnitude of structural support.

However, two moderating points emerged: (1) Asian market forecasters highlighted the potential for rapid, regionally triggered liquidity shocks, reminding that global reflexivity can still catalyze sharp, path-dependent drawdowns; (2) Technical analysis and on-chain analytics both stress that even in bullish cycles, volatility and psychological breaks of major support can cause short-lived, but substantial, corrections.

Critiques and defenses also added nuance about region-specific liquidity risks and the importance of technical triggers, but these appear already reflected in the September correction and do not constitute arguments for a much lower probability. After integrating these perspectives, the risk landscape remains similar: the buffer to the threshold is significant, and the ecosystem has matured against systemic breakdowns.

This move signals a shift from a niche strategy to a broader trend among listed companies. The article cites Bloomberg 2024 data showing a 0.82 correlation between MicroStrategy\u2019s share price and Bitcoin, far exceeding the impact of its core business, and a 2021 Morgan Stanley report that Bitcoin holdings could lift a company\u2019s target price by about 8\u202f%. It also notes that during the 2022 Bitcoin crash of 65\u202f%, MicroStrategy\u2019s shares fell 71\u202f%, outpacing the Nasdaq. A JPMorgan 2023 study found that firms with crypto holdings above 20\u202f% of net assets had a 42\u202f% higher stock\u2011price volatility than the industry average (based on 37 listed firms). To hedge, Meitu (ticker 1357) reduced its Bitcoin\u2011market beta from 1.2 to 0.9 by buying CME Bitcoin futures. Regulatory uncertainty is highlighted by the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase that wiped $3.1\u202fbillion from its market cap in a single day, and by Trump Media\u2019s announcement that mentioned the phrase '\u6ce2\u52d5\u6027\u98a8\u96aa' 17 times. The piece discusses implications for Hong Kong, noting that HKFRS has no clear crypto\u2011asset accounting rules and that investors should scrutinise a company\u2019s on\u2011chain transparency and risk\u2011management capability when evaluating DAT strategies. The article concludes that while DAT can create sustained market premiums when paired with clear funding strategies and strict risk controls, investors must assess whether a firm\u2019s intent is long\u2011term value storage or short\u2011term speculation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[\u5373\u6642\u65b0\u805e instant news](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%e7%b6%93%e6%bf%9f/article/20250923/s00004/1758561103528/%e9%99%b3%e9%a0%b4%e5%b3%af%e5%8d%9a%e5%a3%ab-dat-%e6%95%b8%e5%ad%97%e8%b3%87%e7%94%a2%e8%b2%a1%e5%ba%ab-%e4%b8%8a%e5%b8%82%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e8%b2%a1%e5%ba%ab%e7%ae%a1%e7%90%86%e6%96%b0%e6%b5%aa%e6%bd%ae)\n\n**Crypto Crash: $1.5\u202fBillion in Wagers Liquidated \u2013 Bitcoin on the Decline**\nBitcoin fell below $112,000, dropping 2.9% on Monday, while Ether lost about 9% to $4,075.

The crash pushed the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies below $4\u202ftrillion, according to 'CoinGecko'. The downturn follows a period in which former U.S. President Donald Trump, who had previously called cryptocurrencies a 'Scam', has shifted his stance, launching memecoins with his wife Melania and securing a $1\u202fbillion deal between Trump Media & Technology Group and the exchange 'crypto.com'. The U.S. government has also adopted several crypto\u2011friendly measures\u2014building a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dropping lawsuits against crypto firms, enacting laws that allow banks to issue stablecoins, and permitting pension funds to invest in cryptocurrencies\u2014which helped lift Bitcoin to a record high of $120,000 in August, double the previous year\u2019s peak. Despite the market pullback, the Trump family reportedly stands to gain from their crypto investments, with two holdings valued at $6.5\u202fbillion, surpassing the earnings from their traditional real\u2011estate business, according to 'The Telegraph'.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:49 PM\nSource:[Focus](https://www.focus.de/finanzen/krypto-crash-1-5-milliarden-dollar-an-wetten-liquidiert-bitcoin-auf-talfahrt_04dafd1b-a1d7-4937-b53e-1b1b220bd01b.html)\n\n**Crypto suffers \u00a31bn slump as 'Trump bump' fades**\nTraders lost $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) of cryptocurrency bets when prices fell, according to Coinglass data. The slump hit 407,000 traders who had leveraged positions, triggering margin calls. Bitcoin fell 2.9% to below $112,000, while Ether dropped 9% to $4,075. The total market cap fell below $4tn, per CoinGecko. Coinbase shares slid 2.7% in pre\u2011market trading. The decline followed a rally that had been fueled by Donald Trump\u2019s pro\u2011crypto stance. Mr Trump once called cryptocurrencies a \"scam\", but has adopted a far more crypto\u2011friendly tone in his second term, launching his own \"memecoins\" and signing a multibillion\u2011dollar deal with Crypto.com. The administration has also enacted pro\u2011crypto policies, such as a strategic Bitcoin reserve and dropping lawsuits against crypto firms. Congress has passed laws allowing banks to issue stablecoins, and Trump has said pension funds should be able to invest in crypto. Bitcoin reached $120,000 in August, its highest level since the 2020 election. Edouard Hindi, chief investment officer at Tyr Capital, said the market is \"unwinding\" after overvaluation. He noted that 'you could just feel that there was something growing\u2026 the market froze, liquidity dropped and a couple of investors liquidated their positions overnight.' He added, 'It didn't make sense. That premia was a bit too high and the whole thing has started to unwind in the last 10 days.' The Trump family has made billions from a series of crypto ventures, with two of the family's crypto investments valued at a combined $6.5bn earlier this month.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Between July\u202f2024 and June\u202f2025, the region processed $2.3\u202ftrillion in received transaction value, peaking at $244\u202fbillion in December\u202f2024, driven by institutional inflows and post\u2011election bullish sentiment. Stablecoin usage also reached a record high in December\u202f2024, signalling a shift from speculative trading to regulated investment vehicles.\n\nU.S. regulators have moved from uncertainty to streamlined frameworks. The SEC, OCC, and CFTC have updated guidance, and in July\u202f2025 President Trump\u2019s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released recommendations to crown the U.S. as the \u2018crypto capital of the world.\u2019 The GENIUS Act, signed that month, created a two\u2011tier system for stablecoins: federal oversight for issuers with market caps above $10\u202fbillion and state oversight for smaller issuers.\n\nTokenized U.S. Treasuries and spot bitcoin ETFs are highlighted as key drivers. Tokenized money\u2011market funds grew from $2\u202fbillion AUM in August\u202f2024 to over $7\u202fbillion by August\u202f2025. Global bitcoin ETF AUM reached $179.5\u202fbillion by mid\u2011July\u202f2025, with U.S.\u2011listed funds holding more than $120\u202fbillion. Ethereum ETFs amassed $24\u202fbillion shortly after launch.\n\nStablecoins dominate the ecosystem, with monthly transfer volumes in 2025 routinely exceeding $2\u202ftrillion and peaking near $3\u202ftrillion. From January to July 2025, adjusted transaction value approached $16\u202ftrillion, nearly triple the previous year\u2019s figures. These USD\u2011pegged digital dollars facilitate global settlements, remittances, and DeFi trading.\n\nThe article notes volatility: transaction values dropped 35\u202f% in September\u202f2024 and rose 84\u202f% in November. North America leads in high\u2011value deals, with 45\u202f% of transactions over $10\u202fmillion versus Europe\u2019s 34\u202f%. Centralized exchanges accounted for $2.7\u202ftrillion in bitcoin purchases, $1.5\u202ftrillion in ethereum, and $454\u202fbillion in USDT between June\u202f2024 and July\u202f2025, with bitcoin maintaining a 42\u202f% fiat trading share since late\u202f2022.\n\nChainalysis concludes that ETF approvals and Treasury tokenization herald a golden era for U.S.-led digital finance, positioning the U.S. to maintain economic primacy in the blockchain transition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 09:23 PM\nSource:[Crowdfund Insider](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2025/09/251692-crypto-etfs-and-digital-assets-treasuries-are-shaping-digital-finance-in-the-us-analysis/)\n\n**US and UK Create Joint Crypto Task Force to Shape Future Regulations - Brave New Coin**\nOn September 22, 2025, the United States and the United Kingdom announced the creation of the Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future, a joint body that will develop shared policies for digital assets within 180 days. The task force, led by officials from the US Treasury and the UK Treasury and including regulators from both countries, aims to coordinate rules while each nation is still drafting its own legislation and to facilitate cross\u2011border capital raising for crypto companies. The US Treasury Department stated, 'These recommendations are to be developed in close collaboration with industry partners ensuring we unlock opportunities for investors, businesses, and market participants on both sides of the Atlantic.' Major financial and crypto firms\u2014Bank of America, Barclays, Circle, Citi, Coinbase, and Ripple\u2014sent representatives to early meetings. Dante Disparte of Circle called the task force a 'pivotal step forward' and said it would help create 'safer, more resilient markets.' Coinbase highlighted the need for a 'stablecoin corridor' between the two countries. The announcement follows the Trump administration\u2019s pro\u2011crypto stance and the UK\u2019s April 2025 draft legislation that will bring crypto firms under the same regulatory framework as traditional financial firms, with full rules expected in 2026. The task force faces challenges such as stablecoin regulation and balancing innovation with consumer protection. Market reactions included a 3.5% drop in Coinbase shares and Bitcoin trading at about $112,700, down 2.4% in 24 hours. The partnership is seen as a potential global benchmark for crypto regulation, with the US and UK hoping to outpace other financial centers like Singapore and Hong Kong.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 11:10 PM\nSource:[Brave New Coin](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/us-and-uk-create-joint-crypto-task-force-to-shape-future-regulations)\n\n**Dr. Chen Ying\u2011feng: DAT Digital Asset Treasury \u2013 A New Wave for Listed Companies**\nThe article reports that in August 2024, former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Trump Media & Technology Group announced a strategic partnership with the top\u201110 cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com, using $105\u202fmillion of company funds to buy CRO tokens and create a corporate digital\u2011asset treasury (DAT). This move signals a shift from a niche strategy to a broader trend among listed companies. The article cites Bloomberg 2024 data showing a 0.82 correlation between MicroStrategy\u2019s share price and Bitcoin, far exceeding the impact of its core business, and a 2021 Morgan Stanley report that Bitcoin holdings could lift a company\u2019s target price by about 8\u202f%. It also notes that during the 2022 Bitcoin crash of 65\u202f%, MicroStrategy\u2019s shares fell 71\u202f%, outpacing the Nasdaq. A JPMorgan 2023 study found that firms with crypto holdings above 20\u202f% of net assets had a 42\u202f% higher stock\u2011price volatility than the industry average (based on 37 listed firms). To hedge, Meitu (ticker 1357) reduced its Bitcoin\u2011market beta from 1.2 to 0.9 by buying CME Bitcoin futures. Regulatory uncertainty is highlighted by the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase that wiped $3.1\u202fbillion from its market cap in a single day, and by Trump Media\u2019s announcement that mentioned the phrase '\u6ce2\u52d5\u6027\u98a8\u96aa' 17 times. The piece discusses implications for Hong Kong, noting that HKFRS has no clear crypto\u2011asset accounting rules and that investors should scrutinise a company\u2019s on\u2011chain transparency and risk\u2011management capability when evaluating DAT strategies. The article concludes that while DAT can create sustained market premiums when paired with clear funding strategies and strict risk controls, investors must assess whether a firm\u2019s intent is long\u2011term value storage or short\u2011term speculation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[\u5373\u6642\u65b0\u805e instant news](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%e7%b6%93%e6%bf%9f/article/20250923/s00004/1758561103528/%e9%99%b3%e9%a0%b4%e5%b3%af%e5%8d%9a%e5%a3%ab-dat-%e6%95%b8%e5%ad%97%e8%b3%87%e7%94%a2%e8%b2%a1%e5%ba%ab-%e4%b8%8a%e5%b8%82%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e8%b2%a1%e5%ba%ab%e7%ae%a1%e7%90%86%e6%96%b0%e6%b5%aa%e6%bd%ae)\n\n**US\u2011UK Transatlantic Working Group to Explore Crypto Regulation Collaboration**\nOn September 22 2025, the U.S. Treasury and the UK Treasury announced the creation of a Transatlantic Working Group on Future Markets to examine cryptocurrency laws and regulations. The group, which will operate through the existing UK\u2011US Financial Regulation Working Group, is expected to publish a report with recommendations within 180 days. It will study how the two countries can collaborate on wholesale digital\u2011market innovation and will seek input from leading industry experts, as the Treasury said it would \"recabar la opini\u00f3n de los principales expertos del sector\". The announcement followed a Financial Times report of a meeting between UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Representatives from several crypto firms participated in the discussion. The U.S. Treasury did not say whether the group relates to pending U.S. legislation such as the Payment Stablecoin Framework Act (GENIUS). Coinbase\u2019s vice\u2011president Daniel Seifert said the company was \"orgullosa\" of supporting the collaboration. Both governments have taken steps to address regulatory issues for digital assets in 2025, including a memorandum of understanding signed by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and former U.S. President Donald Trump to explore technology development, though the agreement is not legally binding. The U.S. Treasury has also indicated it will explore \"neutral budgetary paths\" for acquiring Bitcoin as part of its crypto reserve plans.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 07:45 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/us-uk-digital-asset-task-force-regulation)\n\n**Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP In Freefall: What's Driving The Current Crypto Slump?**\nThe cryptocurrency market began the week with a notable downturn, as total sector capitalization dipped toward $3.8\u202ftrillion. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant correction, trading as low as $112,700. CoinGecko data shows that this decline had a ripple effect, causing major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) to register losses of 7\u202f%, 5\u202f%, 7\u202f%, and 10\u202f%, respectively. The sell\u2011off also impacted crypto\u2011related stocks: Bitcoin investment firm Strategy (MSTR) fell 2.6\u202f%, while US\u2011based crypto asset exchange Coinbase dropped 3.4\u202f% during afternoon trading. In contrast, the benchmark S&P\u202f500 index gained 0.4\u202f%, positioning itself for another potential all\u2011time high. Analysts suggest that the recent market slump can be attributed to a buildup of excess leverage following last Thursday\u2019s Federal Reserve (Fed) decision to cut interest rates. Adam Morgan McCarthy, head of research at Kaiko, indicated that funding rates have risen since the Fed meeting, pointing to speculative trading that may have occurred in the wake of the rate cut. He noted that the combination of excess leverage from speculative bets and an earlier price decline triggered a wave of liquidations, further exacerbating the market downturn. The Fed\u2019s decision to lower borrowing costs by a quarter point marked its first rate cut of 2025. However, as Barron\u2019s reported on Monday, Chair Jerome Powell characterized this move as a 'risk-management cut,' implying a cautious approach rather than a wholesale easing of monetary policy. Despite the immediate challenges facing the cryptocurrency market, the longer\u2011term outlook appears optimistic. Deutsche Bank strategist Marion Laboure expressed confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, predicting it could surpass $120,000 by the end of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource:[NewsBTC](https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-in-freefall-whats-driving-the-current-crypto-slump/)\n\n**Binance-linked cryptocurrency hits record: What is driving the surge? | Stock Market News**\nOn September\u202f22\u202f2025, Bloomberg data showed the BNB token, the fifth\u2011largest cryptocurrency by market value, surged to an all\u2011time high of $1,083 on Sunday. The price later retraced alongside Bitcoin and Ether during a broader market sell\u2011off. The rally has been attributed to speculation that Binance co\u2011founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) may receive a U.S. presidential pardon, a claim he reiterated on a May podcast. He publicly stated on a podcast in May that he was seeking a pardon from US President Donald Trump. Online betting platform Polymarket set a 64\u202f% probability of a pardon on September\u202f13, later dropping to 50\u202f%. Patrick Horsman, co\u2011founder of Build and Build Corp, told Bloomberg that 'Rumors of CZ's (Changpeng Zhao) possible pardon fuel further speculation,' he said. Regulatory pressure is also a factor: Senator Elizabeth Warren has asked the U.S. Justice Department to confirm Binance\u2019s compliance with its 2023 settlement over money\u2011laundering and sanctions violations, and Binance may soon negotiate a deal to remove an external compliance monitor. CoinMarketCap data indicate that listed accumulators hold about $560\u202fmillion of BNB, representing 0.4\u202f% of the total supply.

Coinbase CEO Armstrong Names Trigger - Business Insider**\nThe article reports that the cryptocurrency market has been largely sideways over the weekend, with Bitcoin trading around $115,000 and Ethereum near $4,500. 2025 has seen a positive trend, as Bitcoin has gained roughly 25\u202f% year\u2011to\u2011date, largely driven by regulatory changes in the United States.  Under the Trump administration a more crypto\u2011friendly environment was created, and the current focus is on the proposed \"Clarity Act\" (also known as the Market Structure Bill).  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the Act could be the \"next decisive step\" for U.S. regulation, providing legal certainty for companies, investors and projects and potentially becoming \"the biggest catalyst\" for the sector.  The bill, H.R. 3633, would split oversight between the SEC and CFTC, require exchanges and brokers to register, set transparency and disclosure obligations, and regulate stablecoins while excluding certain DeFi activities and banning a Fed\u2011issued CBDC.  It was passed by the House in July 2025 and is now in the Senate Banking Committee.  Analyst Daniel Olshansky views the Act as a technical improvement in jurisdictional clarity but notes token classification remains complex, with assets split into speculative ROI tokens, utility tokens (including stablecoins and infrastructure) and security tokens focused on governance or privacy.  He expects courts to decide on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis, so full clarity may not arrive immediately.  The article also highlights the importance of speed in the volatile crypto sector, citing Snorter's Telegram\u2011based bot that processes blockchain data in real time to execute trades instantly, giving traders an edge in markets where seconds matter.  Snorter's SNORT token, used to access the bot, offers lower fees, voting rights and staking rewards; the presale raised over $4\u202fmillion, signalling strong demand for automated trading solutions.  The project operates on Solana for low fees and high speed, with plans to expand to other blockchains.

Ethereum has also surged to $4.7K, its highest level since late 2021. The rise in Bitcoin is driven by a favorable legislative environment created by President Donald Trump, which has increased demand and potential for further gains. The coordinated action highlights that mainstream benchmarks and speculative market corners are using the same source of optimism. According to CoinGecko, both tokens now account for roughly 70% of all cryptocurrency market valuation. The steady demand from recently active treasury firms has driven Ether's rise, while Bitcoin's more gradual ascent has relied on ongoing exchange-traded inflows despite technical resistance. As anticipated, this week's US inflation data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in September, improving financial conditions and attracting capital from blue-chip stocks to volatile digital tokens.

This growth is largely attributed to the adoption of the first national law on stablecoins in the US, initiated by the administration of former President Donald Trump. The law regulates digital assets tied to the US dollar and provides for state oversight, ensuring transparency and security for institutional investors. This has significantly increased the trust of major players in the cryptocurrency market. As Bloomberg reports, citing CoinGecko data, the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has exceeded $4 trillion for the first time in history. The law establishes clear rules for stablecoin issuers, including reserve requirements and liability, and opens the door for traditional financial institutions to participate in the cryptocurrency sector. The cryptocurrency community has welcomed the law, as it reduces regulatory uncertainty and encourages institutional capital to enter the cryptocurrency space. Analysts predict that if the US maintains a favorable policy and a stable regulatory environment, the market capitalization may reach $5 trillion by the end of 2025. 'The path for Bitcoin to reach $150,000 looks increasingly inevitable,' said an analyst. In the wake of the growth in Bitcoin's value, the altcoin segment has also become more active. For example, Ether has risen by 22% over the past five days, Uniswap has increased by 24%, and Solana has added 6.5%.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 07:10 AM\nSource:[pozitciya.com.ua](https://pozitciya.com.ua/111315-kriptorinok-perevischiv-4-trln-zavdyaki-zakonu-trampa-pro-steyblkoyini.html)\n\n**Crypto Policy Under the Trump Administration Could Enhance Adoption of Digital Assets : Analysis**\nThe Trump Administration has ushered in a transformative period for cryptocurrency policy in the United States, aiming to position the nation as the global 'crypto capital.' President Trump signed two pivotal executive orders, including the 'Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology' order, which promotes self-custody, blockchain access, mining, and uncensored transactions while prohibiting the development of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The order also established the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, chaired by David Sacks, to deliver a federal regulatory framework within 180 days. The Treasury Department created a 'Strategic Crypto Reserve,' including assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano, positioning cryptocurrencies alongside traditional reserves like gold. The SEC has launched 'Crypto 2.0,' a task force to develop clear regulatory boundaries and sensible disclosure frameworks, and has rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, allowing banks to custody client crypto assets. The GENIUS Act, signed by President Trump on July 18, 2025, regulates stablecoins, sets clear rules for banks and issuers, and marks a historic recognition of crypto in U.S. law. However, challenges remain, including potential volatility from speculative investments and unresolved regulatory questions around decentralized finance (DeFi).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 01:04 AM\nSource:[Crowdfund Insider](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2025/07/247004-crypto-policy-under-the-trump-administration-could-enhance-adoption-of-digital-assets-analysis/)\n\n**Cryptocurrencies Surpass $4 Trillion in Value, Marking a Significant Milestone**\nThe cryptocurrency market has surpassed $4 trillion in value for the first time in its history, according to data from CoinGecko. This milestone marks a significant step towards maturity for the sector, which aims to move beyond speculation and become a mainstream part of the global financial landscape. The US legislature is working to regulate this market, with the passage of the 'Genius Act' law, which will establish federal and state regulation of dollar-pegged stablecoins. The law, which has already been approved by the Senate, is now awaiting President Trump's signature. The 'Genius Act' aims to promote transparency and security, while also encouraging widespread adoption. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies continue to set new records, with Bitcoin reaching $120,000 and Ether more than doubling in value in the past quarter. Analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. As institutional investors increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies as a safe-haven asset or long-term speculation, more listed companies are allocating a portion of their reserve capital to Bitcoin, solidifying the sector's reputation as a 'safe-haven'. The stock market is also reflecting this trend, with stocks like Coinbase and Robinhood reaching record highs due to the cryptocurrency rally. The rapid growth of Ether-related titles and other altcoins demonstrates a thriving ecosystem, marking a turning point for the sector as it becomes increasingly integrated into traditional regulatory and financial circuits.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: July 21, 2025 07:09 AM\nSource:[QuiFinanza](https://quifinanza.it/economia/finanza/criptovalute-massimi-capitalizzazione/920977/)\n\n**Cryptocurrency Market Surpasses $4 Trillion, Marking a New Era for Digital Finance**\nThe cryptocurrency market has surpassed $4 trillion in value for the first time in its history, according to CoinGecko, reaching $3.92 trillion before closing on Friday, July 18, 2025. This milestone marks a significant maturation of the sector, which is moving away from its speculative aura and becoming a major player in the global financial landscape. A key factor in this growth is the passage of the 'Genius Act' in the US House of Representatives, which aims to regulate stablecoins anchored to the US dollar. The law, now headed to President Trump for signature, aims to establish transparency and security, while also promoting widespread adoption. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has broken through the $120,000 barrier, reaching new all-time highs, while Ether has more than doubled in value over the past quarter. According to Bernardston, a prominent broker, Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. As institutional investors increasingly turn their attention to these assets, more companies are allocating a portion of their reserve capital to Bitcoin, solidifying their confidence in the sector as a 'safe-haven' asset. The stock market is also reflecting this trend, with companies like Coinbase and Robinhood reaching record highs due to the cryptocurrency rally. Additionally, the rapid growth of Ether-related titles and other altcoins demonstrates a thriving ecosystem. As such, this marks a turning point for the sector, with a new era of digital finance on the horizon.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: July 21, 2025 06:37 AM\nSource:[La Repubblica](https://finanza.repubblica.it/News/2025/07/21/il_mercato_crypto_supera_i_4_trilioni_di_dollari_una_nuova_era_per_la_finanza_digitale-11/)\n\n**Crypto sector breaches $4tn in market value**\nThe crypto sector's market value reached $4 trillion on Friday, according to CoinGecko, marking a significant milestone in its growth. The sector's expansion is attributed to renewed optimism, regulatory clarity, and rising institutional flows. The US House of Representatives passed a bill to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, sending it to President Donald Trump for signature. Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that the legislation signals a shift in attitudes towards the crypto industry. The $4 trillion milestone highlights the sector's growth from its speculative origins to a central part of the global investment landscape. Stablecoins, used for instant payments, are gaining popularity, and corporate treasury allocations to bitcoin are increasing. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, set a record by crossing the $120,000 mark earlier this week and is forecast to reach $200,000 by end-2025. Ether, the second-biggest crypto token, has more than doubled over the past three months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 20, 2025 07:44 PM\nSource:[The Daily Star](https://www.thedailystar.net/business/global-economy/news/crypto-sector-breaches-4tn-market-value-3944256)\n\n**Cryptocurrency Market Surpasses $4 Trillion as US Regulatory Advancements Drive Price Surge**\nThe cryptocurrency market has surpassed $4 trillion in total market capitalization, driven by the surge in XRP and Ethereum (ETH) prices. According to CoinGecko, this is the first time the market has reached this level, reflecting a rotation of capital from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins. The price increase, the largest since November 2021, is directly linked to the regulatory advancements in the United States, a shift in the era of Biden. The Congress has approved two widely anticipated laws: the GENIUS Act, focused on stablecoins, and the CLARITY Act, which sets guidelines for the cryptocurrency market in general. Both measures received bipartisan support and are now awaiting signature from President Donald Trump. Additionally, a report by the Financial Times revealed that Trump may sign an executive order in the coming days authorizing investment in cryptocurrencies through 401(k) retirement accounts. This news led Bitcoin to surpass $120,000, while XRP broke its 2018 historical maximum and reached $3.50, with a 14% increase in the day and over $200 billion in market value. 'The approval of the GENIUS Act represents a historic turning point,' said Rep. French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. According to him, the project 'establishes clear rules for stablecoin payments.' Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, described the advancement as 'an important milestone for US leadership in payment innovation, with a focus on consumer safety.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 18, 2025 10:40 AM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mercados/xrp-e-ethereum-disparam-e-mercado-cripto-vai-a-us-4-tri-apos-eua-aprovarem-regulacao/)\n\n**Bitcoin Surpasses $123,000 for the First Time in History**\nBitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $123,091 for the first time in its history, according to CoinMarketCap. This comes as investors expect a long-awaited political gain for this type of asset this week. The US House of Representatives will discuss a series of laws to provide a regulatory framework for the digital assets industry later today, a long-awaited demand. The progress made in cryptocurrency legislation has added momentum to the rally, with the House of Representatives discussing and possibly voting on the 'Clarity' law, the central bank digital currency monitoring law, and the 'Genius' package of stablecoins introduced by the Senate, while Republicans are moving to support President Donald Trump's agenda in favor of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has risen by 29% since the beginning of the year, leading to a broader recovery in other cryptocurrencies in recent weeks despite the tariffs imposed by Trump and the chaos they caused. George Mandris, a major trader at eXBT Trading, said, 'This shift indicates a mature perspective on Bitcoin; it's not just a speculative asset, but a complete hedging tool and a rare value store.' Investors have injected more than $2.7 billion into US-traded Bitcoin funds last week, marking the fifth-largest weekly inflow since its debut in January last year. The 12 funds now manage a combined $151 billion in assets, and the open interest in Bitcoin futures has reached a record high of $86.3 billion, according to data from CoinGlass. In terms of decentralized trading, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has risen to its highest level in over 5 months at $3,062, and 'XRP' has risen by about 3%.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 14, 2025 08:09 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2025/7/14/bitcoin-first-history-price)\n\n**Bitcoin Surpasses $118,000 for the First Time in History**\nBitcoin has surpassed $118,000 for the first time in its history, according to data from the cryptocurrency exchange platform 'CoinGecko'. The price of Bitcoin rose from around $113,000 on Thursday evening to $118,000 at 9:03 am on Friday, before falling back to $117,262. This is the highest level in the history of the cryptocurrency, surpassing the previous record of $111,000 set in May. According to Anadolu Ajans\u0131's correspondent, this significant increase in price is driven by unprecedented inflows into Bitcoin futures traded on the US stock exchange, as well as a range of political and economic factors. These factors include the ongoing decline in the value of the dollar and legislative efforts in the US Congress to regulate the cryptocurrency market, particularly stablecoins, which are often pegged to the dollar or euro to ensure their stability. Additionally, the positive stance on cryptocurrencies by the administration of US President Donald Trump has added momentum to this increase, amidst growing political support for this sector. In this context, the US Senate recently approved a bill known as the 'Geneva Act', aimed at establishing a regulatory framework to protect users of stablecoins. The bill is expected to be presented to the US House of Representatives next week, seen by observers as a step towards wider official recognition of digital assets in the US. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency futures market has seen unprecedented liquidations, with over $1.11 billion in short positions being closed in just 24 hours, according to data from 'Quandl'. This is the largest liquidation since the beginning of the year, exceeding the previous record set on May 10, reflecting the volatility of the market and the impact of Bitcoin's sudden surge on traders who had bet on its decline.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 05:38 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B2-118-%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87/3628516)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a wide range of expert perspectives\u2014including on-chain analytics, market sentiment, regulatory compliance, regional Asian markets, efficient market hypothesis, behavioral finance, monetary theory, asset pricing, technical analysis, cryptography, and distributed systems\u2014there is a strong consensus that Bitcoin is highly likely to close 2025 at a price above its January 1 opening of $93,429.20. All experts emphasize the formidable bullish tailwinds from unprecedented US (and international) pro-crypto policies, major legislative progress (GENIUS and CLARITY Acts), the Trump administration\u2019s supportive stance, massive institutional and ETF inflows (exceeding $120B in AUM), and the entry of pension funds and corporate treasuries. These factors are described as creating a robust price floor, shifting market structure away from purely speculative cycles toward greater institutional stability.\n\nThe experts recognize the September correction and major leveraged liquidations (over $1.5B in value), with several explicitly flagging the risk of further drawdown or unwinding of the 'Trump bump' premium. However, most view the recent volatility as a healthy cleansing typical in bull cycles, and note that the current price (roughly $112,000) provides a significant buffer (~17\u201320%) above the resolution threshold. Experts consistently point out that, historically, Bitcoin almost always closes the year higher after setting new all-time highs and when regulatory/institutional support is strong, except in rare major bear markets or black swan events.\n\nBearish scenarios are outlined\u2014involving macroeconomic shocks, major regulatory reversals, significant security breaches, or the collapse of a major exchange or stablecoin\u2014but are deemed lower probability unless coupled with cascading negative events. All experts assign their probabilities for a 'Yes' outcome (closing above $93,429.20) in a high range, from 83% to 92%, calibrating slightly lower for lingering drawdown risk and crypto\u2019s characteristic volatility, but overwhelmingly converging on 'Yes' being the base case. The modal reasoning is that only a severe, unexpected crisis would be sufficient to erase the existing price cushion and counteract current base rates and policy/market structure shifts. In summary, experts overwhelmingly expect Bitcoin to finish 2025 above its starting price, with only moderate caution for volatility or tail risks.",
