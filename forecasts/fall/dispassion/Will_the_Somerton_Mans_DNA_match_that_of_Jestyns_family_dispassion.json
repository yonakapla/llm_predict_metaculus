The willingness of living descendants to provide samples is an asset, but ultimately cannot overcome the base rate for failed or inconclusive results in similarly degraded samples.

These factors make successful autosomal profile recovery much less likely than in many other recent cold cases, some of which benefited from better preservation or less chemical interference. Furthermore, the reasoning does not fully account for the informational signal in the lack of any publicized success after several years of high-profile work on this case. In my judgment, these technical and procedural headwinds should push the probability closer to the lower end of the spectrum, as seen in the 12-20% range posited by other specialists.

Their reasoning accurately acknowledges the rising base rate for successful identifications in recent cold cases, while also realistically highlighting the severe technical obstacles presented by the Somerton Man's embalmed and long-interred remains. Importantly, they recognize that, if a usable DNA profile were obtained, a match would be highly likely due to the clear genealogical hypotheses and living relatives. However, they correctly identify that the primary risk is failure to extract usable DNA or bureaucratic/administrative delays, not the absence of a biological relationship. Their probability, slightly below mine, reflects a careful weighting of technical potential against the inertia of the status quo and the imminent resolution deadline. From a genetics standpoint, this middle-ground estimate is well-defended and appropriately cautious."

This forecaster accurately identifies the dual challenges of technical feasibility and the procedural need for timely, public confirmation. Their reasoning is prudent, avoiding both undue pessimism (since breakthroughs do occur) and unwarranted optimism (given the overwhelming technical and bureaucratic headwinds). This conservative estimate is justified by both historical precedent and the current lack of positive news, making it a strong and defensible position within the field."

The forecast rightly emphasizes the importance of the status quo and the lack of new positive evidence, while not dismissing recent advances in the field. By assigning a low\u2014but nonzero\u2014probability (18%), they avoid the common pitfall of overestimating the power of technology in the face of harsh biological realities.

The woman, identified as Linda Cecilia Haddad, was 39 years old at the time of her death and originally from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her remains were found by a passerby and an IDOT snowplow driver along US Route 136 between Le Roy and Bellflower. Initial medical examiners found no evidence of foul play, but her identity remained unknown despite extensive investigations, including interviews with individuals who had given her rides, forensic anthropological analysis, and DNA submissions to CODIS and NamUs, which yielded no matches. In 2016 and again in 2021, leads were pursued but did not result in identification. In August 2023, Moxxy Forensic Investigations, in partnership with the McLean County Coroner's Office and Sheriff's Office, reopened the case. After a fundraising campaign achieved its goal in November 2024, genetic genealogical analysis began in February 2025. By late March 2025, a potential candidate was identified through living relatives; a DNA sample from a relative confirmed the match. Final confirmation was made on August 1, 2025, when genetic comparison confirmed Linda Cecilia Haddad, born August 27, 1942, as the deceased. The investigation involved collaboration with Genologue (Atlanta, GA) for DNA sequencing, Parabon NanoLabs (Reston, VA) for bioinformatics, and the public DNA database GEDmatch. Seven investigative genetic genealogists conducted a month-long analysis. Moxxy Forensic Investigations' co-founder Kaycee Connelly called the case 'a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when science, compassion, and determination come together.' Haddad\u2019s family expressed gratitude to the investigative teams and the people of Le Roy, Illinois, who had helped her in her final days. McLean County Sheriff Matt Lane praised the dedicated efforts of past and present investigators, stating the case brought closure after 43 years. This was McLean County\u2019s only unidentified person case.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:43 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/genetic-genealogy-solves-43-old-004318166.html)\n\n**Dear Abby: Man asked to confirm paternity after stranger's DNA test raises questions**\nA man from Texas, referred to as 'Maybe Uncle,' received a DNA match from a stranger identifying her as his niece, based on a shared genetic profile.

The expert reported that 72 of the 100 tested samples contained a mixture of DNA from both Delphine and C\u00e9dric (referred to as \u2018mixture\u202fA\u2019), while 28 samples contained only C\u00e9dric\u2019s DNA. No sample yielded DNA belonging solely to Delphine, and no other DNA profiles were identified. The expert confirmed that the hair samples from the Peugeot\u202f207, the bedding, and the washing machine yielded no exploitable genetic profiles, and that the only positive blood test was a mixture of the two spouses\u2019 DNA.

She reports that he locks eyes, touches, and kisses these women while she feels ignored, humiliated, and disrespected.

Eric replies with two pieces of advice: 1) if the boyfriend refuses to stop, she should separate herself from the relationship until the issue is resolved, and 2) she should seek confirmation from trusted friends about what she is witnessing. Eric emphasizes that the behavior is unhealthy and that she should not dismiss her own experience. The second part of the article is a separate letter from a 64\u2011year\u2011old man to his father. He recounts discovering through DNA testing that his three children are not biologically his, and that his ex\u2011wife has had children with other men. He expresses deep emotional conflict but also a commitment to his children and grandchildren. He writes to his father, explaining that family is defined by love and connection rather than blood relation, and that his children consider him their father.

The woman, identified as Linda Cecilia Haddad, was 39 years old at the time of her death and originally from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her remains were found by a passerby and an IDOT snowplow driver along US Route 136 between Le Roy and Bellflower. Initial medical examiners found no evidence of foul play, but her identity remained unknown despite extensive investigations, including interviews with individuals who had given her rides, forensic anthropological analysis, and DNA submissions to CODIS and NamUs, which yielded no matches. In 2016 and again in 2021, leads were pursued but did not result in identification. In August 2023, Moxxy Forensic Investigations, in partnership with the McLean County Coroner's Office and Sheriff's Office, reopened the case. After a fundraising campaign achieved its goal in November 2024, genetic genealogical analysis began in February 2025. By late March 2025, a potential candidate was identified through living relatives; a DNA sample from a relative confirmed the match. Final confirmation was made on August 1, 2025, when genetic comparison confirmed Linda Cecilia Haddad, born August 27, 1942, as the deceased. The investigation involved collaboration with Genologue (Atlanta, GA) for DNA sequencing, Parabon NanoLabs (Reston, VA) for bioinformatics, and the public DNA database GEDmatch. Seven investigative genetic genealogists conducted a month-long analysis. Moxxy Forensic Investigations' co-founder Kaycee Connelly called the case 'a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when science, compassion, and determination come together.' Haddad\u2019s family expressed gratitude to the investigative teams and the people of Le Roy, Illinois, who had helped her in her final days. McLean County Sheriff Matt Lane praised the dedicated efforts of past and present investigators, stating the case brought closure after 43 years. This was McLean County\u2019s only unidentified person case.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:43 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/genetic-genealogy-solves-43-old-004318166.html)\n\n**Dear Abby: Man asked to confirm paternity after stranger's DNA test raises questions**\nA man from Texas, referred to as 'Maybe Uncle,' received a DNA match from a stranger identifying her as his niece, based on a shared genetic profile.

The brother confirmed the encounter and is emotionally overwhelmed by the revelation, as he is already raising a child and his wife is pregnant again.

The initiative is part of a nationwide effort to aid criminal investigations, citing the 28\u2011year\u2011old rape\u2011murder case in Nanjing that was solved in 2020 when the suspect\u2019s Y\u2011DNA matched a sample from a male relative in the Y\u2011library.

The Y\u2011library, which records Y\u2011chromosome data from male family members, is said to be effective because Y\u2011DNA is passed unchanged from father to son, making it useful for tracing paternal lineages. Experts quoted in the piece explain that a Y\u2011library can narrow investigations to a specific family branch, saving time and resources. The article notes that other regions\u2014Hubei, Yunnan, Fujian, and parts of Inner Mongolia\u2014have also begun similar projects. Legal experts point out that current Chinese law does not authorize indiscriminate blood collection; it is only permitted for criminal suspects or victims under specific statutes.

Researchers traced the male line of the da\u202fVinci family back to 1331, covering 21 generations and about 400 individuals, and identified at least six living descendants whose DNA confirms a direct link to Leonardo.  The team has also confirmed the existence of a family burial site in the Santa\u202fCroce\u2011in\u2011Vinci church, where the remains of Leonardo\u2019s grandfather Antonio, uncle Francesco, and full\u2011blood brothers are believed to lie.  The next step is to perform genetic analysis of those remains to compare them with the DNA of the living descendants and reconstruct Leonardo\u2019s full genome.  \"Further detailed analyses are needed to determine whether enough DNA has been preserved,\" said David\u202fCaramelli of the University of Florence.  \"By restoring Leonardo\u2019s DNA we hope to understand the biological roots of his exceptional vision and creative abilities,\" added Alessandro\u202fVettczi of the Leonardo da\u202fVinci Heritage Association.

He had caught his ex\u2011wife in bed with another man at that time, remarried at 30, and now worries about the emotional impact on his children and grandchildren. The children, however, have all told him they consider him their father. Eric responds, stressing that family is defined by love and shared history rather than blood ties, and that the children\u2019s affirmation of him as their dad is meaningful. The letter includes the following key facts: the narrator\u2019s age (64), the ages of the children at the time of the affair (2, 4, 6), the DNA test result that the children are not his biological offspring, and the fact that each child has a different biological father.

The first letter, written by a woman who calls herself \"Lover Boy's Lady,\" describes her boyfriend\u2019s repeated, seductive attention toward other women in public and professional settings. She reports that he locks eyes, touches, and kisses these women while she feels ignored, humiliated, and disrespected. She says she has confronted him privately, but he denies the behavior and calls her \"crazy.\" She requests advice on how to handle the situation. Eric replies with two pieces of advice: 1) if the boyfriend refuses to stop, she should separate herself from the relationship until the issue is resolved, and 2) she should seek confirmation from trusted friends about what she is witnessing. Eric emphasizes that the behavior is unhealthy and that she should not dismiss her own experience. The second part of the article is a separate letter from a 64\u2011year\u2011old man to his father. He recounts discovering through DNA testing that his three children are not biologically his, and that his ex\u2011wife has had children with other men. He expresses deep emotional conflict but also a commitment to his children and grandchildren.

The author, who grew up in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, learned that his father had fathered a child with a woman who later married the author's mother, resulting in Linda\u2019s birth in 1954. The DNA match was a 25\u202f% paternal match, prompting the author to send a brief message to Linda asking if they shared the same father. Linda responded quickly, saying, 'Nothing would surprise me,' and revealed that she had always suspected something was amiss in her family. She had been teased as an adopted child and had long wondered why she differed from her siblings. The author and Linda met in person, found striking physical and personality similarities, and have since maintained contact, even traveling together. The narrative explores the emotional complexities of late\u2011life sibling discovery, including the author's lingering grief over his father's death, the sense of loss and anger Linda may feel about never knowing her biological father, and the lack of cultural or literary guidance for such relationships. The author reflects on how this revelation reshapes his understanding of his past and future, and he questions whether he and Linda should merge families, cultivate a private sisterhood, or simply appreciate the serendipity of their meeting.

The Leonardo da\u202fVinci DNA Project, led by Alessandro Vezzosi, Agnese Sabato, David Caramelli, and Elena Pilli, has identified 15 direct male\u2011line descendants linked to Leonardo\u2019s father and half\u2011brother.  Geneticists tested six of these men and found matching Y\u2011chromosome fragments, confirming a 15\u2011generation continuity of the Da\u202fVinci line.  The team plans to compare this living DNA with remains excavated from the Church of Santa\u202fCroce in Vinci, where bone fragments of Leonardo\u2019s grandfather Antonio, his uncle Francesco, and other relatives were recovered.  Caramelli notes that \u2018Further detailed analyses are necessary to determine whether the DNA extracted is sufficiently preserved,\u2019 and that a match would validate centuries of genealogical work.  The project\u2019s goal is to use the DNA to learn about Leonardo\u2019s visual acuity, health, diet, left\u2011handedness, and to potentially verify the authenticity of disputed works.  As Jesse H. Ausubel of The Rockefeller University explains, \u2018Even a tiny fingerprint on a page could contain cells to sequence\u2026 Soon we may gain information about Leonardo and other historical figures once believed lost forever.\u2019  The study also uncovered new details about Leonardo\u2019s family: his grandfather Antonio was a merchant between Catalonia and Morocco, and his mother Caterina may have been a slave in a banker\u2019s household.  Additionally, a charcoal drawing of a \u2018Unicorn Dragon\u2019 found on a fireplace mantle in Vinci is being investigated as a possible Leonardo sketch.

Preer, a 49\u2011year\u2011old mother from Chevy Chase, was found dead in her upstairs bathroom; the original investigation had focused on her husband, Carl \"Sandy\" Preer, who had a strained marriage and a failed polygraph.  DNA recovered from under Preer\u2019s fingernails did not match Sandy, leaving the case unsolved for 23 years.\n\nIn 2022, Augustin was transferred to the cold\u2011case unit and teamed with Dupouy.  They obtained an enhanced DNA profile from Othram, a forensic genetics company, and entered it into public genetic databases.  The search produced a high\u2011match profile linked to a Romanian family line.  Augustin traced the surname \"Gligor\" back to Eugene Gligor, Preer\u2019s daughter\u2019s high\u2011school boyfriend, who was a first cousin twice removed of the Romanian match.\n\nThe detectives collected a DNA sample from a discarded water bottle at Dulles Airport, confirming that Gligor\u2019s DNA matched the sample found under Preer\u2019s fingernails.  They secured arrest warrants, and Gligor was apprehended in Washington, D.C., extradited to Maryland, and charged with second\u2011degree murder.  He pleaded guilty in May 2024 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in August 2025.\n\nDetective Augustin said, 'Throughout my whole career, my goal was to get to the cold case unit,' and noted that the case \"was a sense of closure and just rewarding, letting them know we got the guy and we didn\u2019t forget about Leslie.\"  The investigation cleared Preer\u2019s husband of any involvement and brought closure to the Preer family.\n\nKey metrics: 2001 murder, 23\u2011year cold case, 2022 transfer to cold\u2011case unit, 2024 guilty plea, 22\u2011year sentence in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 05:06 PM\nSource:[abc7ny.com](https://abc7ny.com/post/how-detectives-used-genetic-genealogy-crack-open-23-year-old-cold-case/17801904/)\n\n**Six Men Share Da Vinci\u2019s DNA: Science Opens an Unexpected Path to His Tomb**\nThe Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project, led by Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato, reconstructed seven centuries of genealogy from parish, notarial, and judicial records. Although Leonardo had no direct descendants, the researchers traced the paternal line and half\u2011siblings to locate living male descendants. Of the fifteen identified, six agreed to participate in a genetic analysis coordinated by forensic anthropologist Elena Pilli. The study focused on the Y chromosome, which is transmitted nearly intact from father to son. The concordance among the six descendants confirmed the continuity of the male line across fifteen generations. Scientists also recovered remains of historical ancestors from Tuscan cemeteries, validating their belonging to the same lineage through dating and paleogenomics. Comparison of ancient bones and current DNA supports the lineage, though final verification with the tomb in Amboise, France remains pending. The project also aims to apply genetics to authenticate artworks by analyzing microorganisms, fibers, or biological traces in manuscripts and canvases, matching them to Leonardo\u2019s reconstructed genetic profile. This approach is already used in Europe to resolve questions about old works and could help identify forgeries or confirm authorship, rewriting part of art history. The complete sequencing of Leonardo\u2019s DNA could provide clues about his ancestry, physical traits, and possible medical conditions, offering unprecedented biological context. While genetics cannot explain the origin of genius, it can close questions that history and art criticism have not resolved. The discovery of living descendants and the possibility of comparing their genes with remains and objects linked to Leonardo marks a milestone: modern science is closer than ever to solving the mystery of his tomb and opening a new era in cultural heritage studies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 01:40 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo en Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.gizmodo.com/seis-hombres-comparten-el-adn-de-da-vinci-la-ciencia-abre-un-camino-inesperado-hacia-su-tumba-2000188141)\n\n**6 Living Men Share Leonardo da Vinci's DNA. They Might Prove Where He's Buried.**\nThe Leonardo da\u202fVinci DNA Project has identified a genetic link between six living male descendants and bone fragments recovered from a family tomb at Amboise Castle. Using Y\u2011chromosome analysis, the team confirmed that segments of the Y chromosome matched across the six men, indicating continuity of Leonardo\u2019s male line since the 15th generation. The project began with genealogical research that traced collateral lines through Leonardo\u2019s father and half\u2011brother back to 1331, producing a list of 15 potential male\u2011line descendants. Six of these descendants were tested, and the Y\u2011chromosome matches were reported by Phys.org. The bone fragments, identified as male, were radiocarbon dated and subjected to paleogenomic analysis; their Y chromosome also matched the living samples, allowing the researchers to verify historical paternity records and potentially reconstruct Leonardo\u2019s genome. The project\u2019s broader goals include testing samples from private and public Renaissance art collections, pilot studies on biological material from aging artworks, and microbial flora analysis. Once Leonardo\u2019s DNA is clearer, the team plans to compare it with biological remnants on works attributed to him, which could shed light on his ancestry, pigmentation, and health risks, though it will not decode his artistic genius.\n\nKey metrics: six living descendants tested, 15 male\u2011line descendants identified, lineage traced back to 1331, bone fragments radiocarbon\u2011dated and matched to Y\u2011chromosome segments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65830735/leonardo-da-vinci-dna-project-burial-remains/)\n\n**27 Times It Looked Like DNA Was 'Copy-Pasted' On Different Relatives**\nThe r/AncestryDNA subreddit is a community where people share their genetic ancestry and document their physical resemblance to relatives, some of whom may have lived hundreds of years ago.

'She never gave up, even when judges tried to close the case,' Nathalie said. The family's lawyer, Me Didier Seban, notes that the case is significant because the DNA evidence has been preserved, including the clothes Sabine was wearing and the DNA from the sperm. However, the French DNA database is limited, with only 23 markers used for comparison. In contrast, private companies in the US use thousands of markers, allowing for more accurate matches. The Dumont family hopes to access these databases to find a match and ultimately identify the perpetrator. 'We're not just looking for the perpetrator, but also for justice and truth,' Nathalie said.

This study, the result of decades of interdisciplinary work, also located a family tomb in Vinci that could contain remains compatible with the lineage of the Renaissance genius. The discovery allows for the advancement of da Vinci's genetic profile reconstruction, opening new avenues for understanding aspects of his biology and health, still unknown after five centuries. The study, part of the Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project, was led by Italian researchers Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato, and published in the book Gen\u00eca Da Vinci. Genealog\u00eda e Gen\u00e9tica per il ADN di Leonardo, edited by Angelo Pontecorboli Editore. The research reconstructed a 21-generation genealogical tree, starting from 1331, by analyzing parish records, wills, land registries, and death certificates. The team identified 15 living male descendants of the same family branch as da Vinci's father and one of his half-brothers, Domenico Benedetto. Of these, six voluntarily underwent genetic analysis, revealing clear coincidences in their Y chromosomes. The study highlights the importance of the Y chromosome, which remains almost unchanged from father to son, allowing direct connections to be established in the male line without the need for direct descent, essential given da Vinci's lack of known children. The researchers also located a family tomb in the church of Santa Croce in Vinci, where da Vinci's grandfather Antonio, his uncle Francesco, and several of his half-brothers were buried. Fragments of bones found during the excavation have been dated using carbon 14, and one of them corresponds to a male whose chronology matches the sought-after family generation. The fragment is currently undergoing paleogenetic analysis to determine if its DNA can be compared with that of the living descendants and confirm its belonging to the Da Vinci lineage. If the results match, the team will move towards a more ambitious goal: the partial reconstruction of da Vinci's genetic profile. One of the most striking findings related to the project was a drawing discovered in an old house in Vinci, representing a fantastical creature, the 'Unicornio Drag\u00f3n', and showing stylistic similarities with da Vinci's anatomical studies. Although its authorship is still under study, the drawing was restored and analyzed due to its potential artistic and scientific value. The research not only has a genetic dimension but has also become a tool for reconstructing da Vinci's territory, i.e., the physical and social environment he inhabited. Thanks to the analysis of land registries and writings, the authors of the project have located up to seven family homes in the Vinci area and two inherited properties by da Vinci. The project poses several future lines of study: 'The study of da Vinci's living relatives represents a turning point in the combination of history, archaeology, and biology. The goal is not to build a myth, but to better understand the factors that contributed to forming a figure so influential. It is even possible to find indications of the abilities that characterized him: sharp vision, advanced spatial thinking, multifaceted creativity. In da Vinci's own writings, one can observe reflections on heredity, reproduction, and the impact of the environment on children, made centuries before the development of modern genetics, reinforcing the interest in recovering biological data from the artist from a scientific and non-idealized perspective.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/historia/estupefaccion-cientificos-hallazgo-6-parientes-vivos-leonardo-da-vinci-traves-adn-14852144)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters broadly agree that the probability of the Somerton Man's DNA matching that of 'Jestyn's' family by the December 31, 2025 deadline is low to moderate. The principal obstacles identified are the degraded and embalmed state of the remains, the technical difficulty of DNA extraction, and the lack of any public confirmation or announcement of a match as of mid-October 2025. Advances in forensic genetics and notable recent successes in solving cold cases using modern techniques are noted as factors that increase the chance of a match, especially since Rachel Egan (a Thomson descendant) has volunteered her DNA and the family is cooperative. Many experts cite rare phenotypic traits as circumstantial support for a potential biological relationship but stress that only DNA confirmation can resolve the question. The absence of new, positive results so close to the deadline, despite high public and scientific interest, is seen as a strong negative signal. Forecasted probabilities cluster mostly between 12% and 38%, with one notably higher estimate (63%) that heavily weights recent scientific advances and the strength of phenotypic and circumstantial evidence. Most forecasters consider the likelihood of an official, affirmative announcement before year-end to be modest, with technical and time constraints dominating. Overall, the consensus is that a confirmed DNA match is possible but unlikely by the resolution date, chiefly due to technical challenges and the lack of public disclosure to date.",
