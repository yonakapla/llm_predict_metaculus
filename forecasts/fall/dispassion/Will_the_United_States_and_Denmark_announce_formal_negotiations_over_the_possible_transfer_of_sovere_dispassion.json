However, no new evidence or scenario has been raised that would meaningfully shift the structural, legal, and normative barriers identified in my initial forecast. The Realist critique is well taken as a reminder of the nonzero risk of international shocks, but these are already reflected in the 1% estimate, which is above absolute zero.

No participant identifies overlooked signals or plausible, imminent shocks that could realistically tip the process within the time window. The base rate and discursive environment remain unchanged, and the short time to resolution further reduces the plausibility of a dramatic shift.

The statement, published on November 22, 2025, on the official websites of Sweden and Norway, emphasized that the conflict is not only about Ukraine\u2019s security but also about the security of Europe as a whole. The leaders pledged to maintain and expand sanctions and economic measures against Russia as long as the war continues. They highlighted Ukraine\u2019s consistent willingness to pursue peace, including its readiness for negotiations and work on a peace plan proposed by the U.S., while noting that Russia has not taken any steps toward ceasefire or peace efforts, instead continuing attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. Western leaders called for revisions to the U.S. 'peace plan' under President Donald Trump, which reportedly includes territorial concessions by Ukraine, financial support for reconstruction, gradual lifting of sanctions on Russia, and a long-term economic agreement between Moscow and Washington. The U.S. gave Ukraine until November 27, 2025, to accept the plan, threatening to halt weapons deliveries and intelligence sharing if rejected. The plan is set to be discussed at a meeting on November 23, 2025, in Geneva, involving EU, U.S., and Ukrainian representatives, including Andriy Yermak (head of the President\u2019s Office), Rustem Umerov (Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council), Kyrylo Budanov (Head of the Ukrainian General Staff), and Serhiy Kyslytsya (Deputy Foreign Minister).

If Russia re-occupies Ukraine, a 'determined and coordinated military intervention' and the resumption of sanctions will be triggered. The Kremlin has expressed approval, with Putin stating the U.S. peace plan could form the foundation of a final peace agreement and warning Kyiv that prolonging the war would lead to further territorial losses. Kyiv has reacted with outrage: President Zelenskiy, in a national address, rejected the plan, asserting Ukraine would not sacrifice its national interests and pledged to propose alternatives. Trump, viewing the war as a burden inherited from Biden, reportedly sees Zelenskiy as a 'nuisance' and calculates that ending the conflict could grant the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s resources (minerals, fertile land). Zelenskiy, aware that military success without U.S. support is unlikely and cognizant of corruption scandals involving figures with ties to London, recognizes Putin\u2019s strategic use of the war to consolidate power\u2014suggesting the conflict could drag on for years. His future decisions will prioritize self-preservation over Ukraine\u2019s territorial future. Regardless of debates over who started the war or issues of justice, the concrete realities on the eastern front remain unchanged: no new developments in the eastern theater.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[A Haber](https://www.ahaber.com.tr/yazarlar/melih-altinok/2025/11/23/yoksa-bu-savas-yillarca-surer)\n\n**USA Attempted to Arrange High-Level Meeting with Greenland's Prime Minister Without Denmark**\nThe White House has not commented on a report by Politiken revealing that the United States has attempted to arrange high-level meetings with representatives from Greenland without Denmark's involvement. According to sources in the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, the U.S. has made multiple attempts to engage directly with Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Greenland\u2019s newly appointed prime minister, since his appointment in April 2025. The standard practice requires both Denmark and Greenland to be present when foreign, security, and defense policies affecting Greenland are discussed. However, the U.S. has reportedly sought direct dialogue, citing Greenland\u2019s strategic importance. In a written response, the White House stated that President Trump believes Greenland would be better protected against modern threats in the Arctic region under U.S. security guarantees. This follows renewed attention to Trump\u2019s interest in purchasing Greenland, which emerged nearly a year prior during his first presidential term. The Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (S), Greenland\u2019s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, and Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen (M) have all declined to comment on the report.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 08:37 PM\nSource:[B.T.](https://www.bt.dk/politik/medie-usa-har-forsoegt-at-arrangere-moede-med-groenlands-regeringschef)\n\n**Greenland Premier Seeks Democratic Partnerships for Rare Earth Development, Excludes China**\nGr\u00f8nland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen stated on November 19, 2025, during an interview with Nikkei, that Gr\u00f8nland seeks cooperation with democratic nations\u2014such as Japan, the European Union, and the United States\u2014for the development of critical minerals like rare earth elements, explicitly excluding the People's Republic of China. This stance comes amid growing Western efforts to reduce dependency on Chinese supply chains, especially as China has weaponized critical minerals. Nielsen emphasized that China is 'not within our consideration' and that Gr\u00f8nland has not received any investment requests from Chinese companies nor intends to consider China as a future partner. He highlighted the importance of strengthening ties with allies, noting that 'we need the EU, and the EU needs Gr\u00f8nland.' The EU has already begun developing mineral projects in Gr\u00f8nland, with the European Commission identifying most critical minerals as present on the island. Gr\u00f8nland's strategic Arctic location has heightened global interest, particularly due to China\u2019s Polar Silk Road initiative and Russia\u2019s growing influence in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously expressed interest in purchasing Gr\u00f8nland, citing national security and economic reasons. Although Nielsen affirmed Gr\u00f8nland will never be sold, he called for deeper cooperation with the U.S., including potential expansion of American military presence. Experts like Professor Marc Lanteigne from the Arctic University of Norway note Gr\u00f8nland holds vast reserves of rare earth elements, uranium, precious metals, and strategic minerals. Companies such as Critical Metals and Amaroq are actively developing resources, with Amaroq discovering commercially viable deposits of germanium and gallium in western Gr\u00f8nland\u2014materials vital for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and military technology. These discoveries underscore the growing global strategic interest in diversifying supply chains away from China, which dominates global supply of these critical minerals.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 08:08 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/11/22/n14641177.htm)\n\n**Greenland PM Seeks Democratic Partnerships for Rare Earth Development, Excludes China**\nGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen stated on November 19, 2025, during an interview with Nikkei, that Greenland is seeking partnerships with democratic nations\u2014specifically Japan, the European Union, and the United States\u2014for the development of critical minerals such as rare earth elements, explicitly excluding China.

Nielsen emphasized that China is 'not in our consideration' and that Greenland has not received any investment requests from Chinese companies, nor does it view China as a future partner. Greenland, located in the Arctic, is seen as a strategic alternative to China for critical minerals due to climate change and increased Arctic navigation.

This is Trump\u2019s 'obsession' with Greenland**\nThe article from TVN24, published on October 21, 2025, reports that despite a period of silence from Donald Trump regarding his interest in acquiring Greenland, his obsession with the territory remains undiminished. According to Politico, high-ranking Danish officials believe Trump is still determined to become the first U.S. president since Andrew Johnson in 1867 to significantly expand American territory. Although recent agreements on defense and trade have improved transatlantic relations, Greenland could become the central flashpoint of a second Trump administration's foreign policy. Danish officials warn that Trump's fixation\u2014described as irrational yet genuine\u2014poses a serious threat to international norms of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The article notes that Greenland's strategic value is not backed by immediate security threats from Russia or China, and American investors have shown little interest in its mineral resources. However, Danish authorities suspect that Trump\u2019s ambitions stem from a symbolic desire to claim land he views as part of America\u2019s manifest destiny. The U.S. president\u2019s approach is also reportedly extended to Canada, though annexing a population of 40 million is seen as impractical. In contrast, Greenland\u2019s population of 56,000 and its 80% ice coverage make it a more feasible target. Trump reportedly claimed, 'I\u2019m sure Denmark will agree,' without consulting Greenland\u2019s Inuit majority, 89% of whom are Inuit, and 85% of whom rejected U.S. sovereignty in a January poll. Intelligence reports suggest U.S. agencies have been identifying potential pro-Trump Greenlanders, and in August, Denmark summoned a senior U.S. diplomat over allegations of three Americans linked to Trump conducting covert operations on the island. Danish officials believe the U.S. strategy may involve economic pressure\u2014either direct payments to residents or influence campaigns targeting local politicians\u2014rather than military invasion. The article emphasizes that Denmark fears a slow, economic takeover could go unnoticed by Brussels and EU partners. The Danish government is seeking broader European support, especially from Berlin and EU institutions, to strengthen Greenland\u2019s security and promote sustainable economic development. Greenland remains under Danish sovereignty but retains European Union citizenship for its residents, allowing access to both systems. The article warns that a Trump-led takeover would likely bring exploitative American investments that disregard Inuit culture, citing Alaska\u2019s treatment of Indigenous people as a cautionary example. Ultimately, Politico concludes that a transatlantic conflict over Greenland may be inevitable, and that if Trump succeeds in pressuring Denmark, other nations may follow suit in challenging international borders.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 01:27 PM\nSource:[TVN24](https://tvn24.pl/biznes/ze-swiata/grenlandia-i-donald-trump-to-ma-byc-obsesja-prezydenta-usa-nie-spodziewaja-sie-inwazji-wojskowej-st8711691)\n\n**PolitiCo: Denmark Still Fears Trump\u2019s Ambitions to Annex Greenland**\nAccording to Politico, Danish authorities remain deeply concerned about the possibility that former U.S. President Donald Trump may seek to annex Greenland, making him the first U.S. president since Andrew Johnson\u2019s acquisition of Alaska in 1867 to significantly expand U.S. territory. Copenhagen is alarmed that some European Union and NATO allies do not fully grasp the severity of the threat Trump\u2019s fixation on Greenland poses to U.S. relations, international respect for sovereignty, and border integrity. Due to concerns over provoking Trump\u2014especially amid ongoing U.S. trade and cooperation negotiations\u2014some allies downplay his statements as attention-seeking rhetoric or jokes, though Danish officials take the threat seriously. The Pentagon has recently included Greenland in the U.S. Northern Command\u2019s area of responsibility, citing enhanced defense capabilities for the continental U.S. and strengthened cooperation with Arctic partners, without informing the Danish government.

Key deposits include the Ilimaussaq Complex (over 11 million tons of rare earth oxide equivalent, TREO >1.5%), the Kringlerne (Killavaat Alannguat) deposit rich in light and heavy rare earths, and the Tanbreez deposit (over 4 million tons of REOs), now owned by Critical Metals Corp. The Kvanefjeld project, rich in neodymium, dysprosium, and uranium, remains on hold due to Greenland\u2019s 2021 uranium mining ban. Energy Transition Minerals (ETM), an Australian firm, is pursuing $11.5 billion in compensation through international arbitration against Greenland and Denmark, arguing the ban constitutes expropriation under investment agreements. Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark since 2009, controls most domestic affairs including natural resources, while Denmark manages foreign policy and defense. Despite U.S. President Trump\u2019s public statements about acquiring Greenland 'one way or another'\u2014though not explicitly committing to military action\u2014U.S. foreign aid has been reallocated under the 'America First' initiative, with $400 million earmarked for Greenland\u2019s economic development and conservation. The EU has made tangible progress, securing a 30-year mining permit for a Danish-French consortium for anorthosite mining, signaling stronger alignment with European interests. Greenland\u2019s exports are dominated by seafood (over 80%), valued at $1.36 billion in July 2025, with major import partners including Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and Canada. Greenlanders hold mixed views on mining, with concerns over environmental risks, especially uranium contamination, and cultural preservation. The government maintains sovereign control over resources and emphasizes negotiation of royalties, environmental safeguards, and local employment. As of October 2025, the Tanbreez Project is progressing toward mining operations by end of 2028, pending submission of plans and financial guarantees. Despite geopolitical tensions and foreign interest from the U.S., EU, and China, Greenland\u2019s strategic importance lies in its vast REM potential, its role in the energy transition, and its complex balance between sovereignty, environmental stewardship, and economic development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:36 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/hot-topics-in-international-trade-8821163/)\n\n**U.S. State Department: Respect Greenlanders' Right to Decide Their Own Future**\nOn August 27, 2025, U.S. charg\u00e9\u2011d\u2019affaires in Denmark Mark Stroh met with Danish and Greenlandic officials after Danish intelligence warned that U.S. citizens were attempting to influence Greenland\u2019s political direction.

    "summary": "All experts overwhelmingly agree that the probability of the United States and Denmark announcing formal negotiations over Greenland's sovereignty before 2026 is exceedingly low, estimating a probability between 1-2%. Their assessments draw on a diverse range of perspectives\u2014including diplomacy, geopolitical risk, international relations (realism, liberalism, constructivism), international law, and Nordic studies\u2014but converge on key factors: (1) Strong and public Danish and Greenlandic resistance to any discussions of sovereignty transfer, underpinned by legal, constitutional, and procedural frameworks requiring both parties' consent. (2) Overwhelming opposition among the Greenlandic population (only 6% in favor) and Danish public, with Greenlandic leaders explicitly ruling out the notion of being 'sold.' (3) The base rate for such territorial negotiations between developed Western democracies is virtually zero, and no modern precedent exists. (4) While the Trump administration's continued interest and unconventional tactics (such as attempts to bypass Denmark) marginally increase the probability, these have been consistently rebuffed and have only reinforced local and European resistance. (5) International norms, legal principles (especially self-determination), and European/EU alliance dynamics create further substantial barriers. (6) All recent evidence points to the status quo persisting, with no signs of political, public opinion, or procedural shifts that would make a public, formal announcement of negotiations plausible in the short remaining time before the resolution deadline. Experts only concede a tiny chance for a 'black swan' event (e.g., sudden political crisis or seismic shift in policy), but find no evidence pointing toward such a development. In sum, barring an extraordinary and unforeseen event, a 'Yes' resolution is extremely unlikely.",
