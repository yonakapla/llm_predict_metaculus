However, recent news and manifestos highlight a cultural and reputational environment that strongly discourages premature or hype-driven AGI claims. The reputational risks for a false or weakly substantiated claim are higher than in prior years, and the technical consensus among experts is that we are not yet at full AGI. The base rate for such a claim is effectively zero to date. Although the window for a dramatic claim remains open (especially under competitive or market pressure), the combination of responsible AI norms, regulatory caution, and the need to avoid global backlash makes a clear AGI claim by year's end unlikely.

The defense of the SCOT perspective reinforces that the claim itself is a socially constructed act, and labs are likely to avoid triggering unpredictable societal reactions. No new argument suggests a material increase in the likelihood of a claim by year's end. Therefore, I will maintain my initial probability.",

No compelling arguments emerged to suggest the probability should be increased; if anything, the slight dispersion (with a handful of 18% forecasts) seems to reflect marginally higher weight on competitive media dynamics, but these arguments were critiqued as potentially overestimating the impact of framing relative to institutional caution.

The group also highlights a recent pattern of walk-backs and hedging after overstatements, further strengthening the expectation of caution. While the Media Studies (Framing/Agenda Setting) perspectives assign slightly higher probabilities due to narrative and hype dynamics, the consensus is that these factors are insufficient to outweigh the risks and base rates.

The points raised in defense of my initial analysis were echoed by others: reputational and regulatory risks are at a peak, the technical bar for AGI is not widely seen as cleared, and historical base rates for such claims are essentially zero. Critiques of somewhat higher probabilities (e.g., from media framing/agenda-setting perspectives) were well-argued, emphasizing that narrative incentives, while real, are not sufficient to overcome the strong institutional and technical headwinds in the current climate. No new information from deliberation justifies increasing my probability, and the consensus supports if anything a slightly lower estimate. However, given the residual possibility of a surprise claim from a highly risk-tolerant actor, I will keep my forecast at 12%, at the high end of the consensus technical cluster, to reflect the small but non-negligible chance that ambiguous definitions and competitive pressures could tip the balance.",

The repeated emphasis on recent walk-backs (such as the GPT-5/Erd\u0151s incident), the pattern of hedging, and the technical bar not being met reinforce the case for a lower probability.

The original question opened on 2024-12-20 20:59:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/30923). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nProgress in artificial intelligence has surged in recent years with generative AI tool adoption [surging in the corporate world](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), and use by a significant portion of the US public for [writing](https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2024/08/08/c472d/1) and for [help in making decisions](https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2024/11/21/b9187/1).\n\nThe rapid AI development has raised questions about the potential of achieving [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) (AGI). Definitions of AGI vary, but in general most definitions align with the interpretation of an AI system operating at or above human level in a broad range of tasks. A number of thinkers have [expressed concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence) about risks to humanity posed by the development of AGI and a majority of Americans described their feelings about advances in AI development as \"cautious\" in a [March 2024 survey](https://today.yougov.com/technology/articles/49099-americans-2024-poll-ai-top-feeling-caution). However, some top AI labs have explicitly targeted AGI development as a goal they are pursuing, including [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/), [DeepMind](https://www.theverge.com/23778745/demis-hassabis-google-deepmind-ai-alphafold-risks), and [Meta](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24042354/mark-zuckerberg-meta-agi-reorg-interview).\n\nThere is much uncertainty and [disagreement](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316969/mustafa-suleyman-sam-altman-microsoft-openai-agi) about when AGI will be achieved, in part because of the varying definitions. While fuzzy definitions might make it difficult to clearly discern when AGI has arrived (for example, see a [recent claim](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/we-have-already-achieved-agi-openai-employee-claims) from December 2024 that AGI has already been achieved) one metric that may be clearer is when a leading AI lab will first publicly claim to have developed AGI.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

        "fine_print": "* A lab will be considered to have claimed to have created AGI if the company or an official representative states publicly that the company considers an AI system they have created to be artificial general intelligence. An official representative must be clearly speaking on behalf of the company.\n* A public claim or statement of opinion by lab leadership that they have developed an AI system that they consider to be AGI will also be sufficient to resolve the question as **Yes**. Lab leadership will be considered to be the chief executive of each organization, or equivalent, or their nearest equivalent successor in the event they depart the company or eliminate the CEO position. If an organization is structured such that its AI lab is part of a larger organization and the AI lab has a clear chief executive, in most cases we will count both the chief executive of the organization and the chief executive of its AI lab. As of December 19, 2024, this is the comprehensive list of qualifying leadership:\n  * OpenAI: CEO Sam Altman\n  * Anthropic: CEO Dario Amodei\n  * Google and DeepMind: CEO Sundar Pichai and CEO Demis Hassabis\n  * Microsoft and Microsoft AI: CEO Satya Nadella and CEO Mustafa Suleyman\n  * NVIDIA: CEO Jensen Huang\n  * xAI: CEO Elon Musk\n  * Meta: CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n  * Mistral: CEO Arthur Mensch\n  * Databricks: CEO Ali Ghodsi\n  * World Labs: CEO Fei-Fei Li\n  * Safe Superintelligence: CEO Daniel Gross\n  * Hugging Face: CEO Clem Delangue\n  * Scale AI: CEO Alexandr Wang\n  * Magic.dev: CEO Eric Steinberger\n  * Amazon: CEO Andy Jassy\n  * Apple: CEO Tim Cook\n  * Netflix: Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters\n  * IBM: CEO Arvind Krishna&#x20;\n* A statement will generally qualify if it represents a claim, position, or opinion of the organization or top leadership. For example, a CEO stating their belief that the organization has created AGI would resolve the question as **Yes**, including in informal settings such as podcast appearances, interviews, or X.com. Statements that do not clearly attribute a position to the organization or CEO are not sufficient. For example, if a CEO were to say \"I think that the AI system we have developed would satisfy some definitions of AGI\" that would **not** be sufficient, because it does not clearly state a belief in having developed AGI under a definition they hold, only that they believe it satisfies definitions of AGI that others hold.\n* There are no requirements on the AI system that is referred to as AGI, there need not be public details, access, or announcements about such a system. However, a statement must refer to a system that the lab claims it has developed. A statement such as \"We are currently developing AGI\" or \"We are currently training AGI\" is not sufficient. Claims will generally be taken at face value, for example a claim that AGI has been developed will be sufficient, even if there is evidence to the contrary indicating that the system has not been completed.\n* Metaculus will assess potentially qualifying statements and reporting and make a determination as to whether the criteria were satisfied. In the event of unclear statements, Metaculus may wait for clarifications or additional context or resolve the question as **ambiguous**.",

The article highlights concerns from industry experts, including a DeepMind safety researcher who stated that current methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are 'far from a complete solution.' The author recounts a personal epiphany during a late-night reading of a DeepMind technical report, where terms like 'severe risks' and 'preventative action' underscored the fragility of existing safety measures. The article calls for urgent action to prevent catastrophic outcomes from AGI, stressing that AGI\u2014defined as AI systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human can\u2014poses unprecedented risks if not properly managed. The piece underscores a growing alarm over the industry's silence on these safety gaps, despite their potential to impact humanity on a scale never seen before.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 04:17 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@meisshaily/shocking-agi-safety-gaps-exposed-15dcaab2f932)\n\n**Are Tech Billionaires Preparing for the End Times? The Rise of Doomsday Bunkers and the AI Fear Paradox**\nThe article explores growing speculation that tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, are preparing for potential existential threats such as nuclear war, climate change, or artificial general intelligence (AGI) by building underground bunkers. According to BBC News T\u00fcrk\u00e7e, Zuckerberg reportedly began a project in 2014 on his 1,400-acre Kauai estate in Hawaii to create a self-sustaining refuge with independent energy and food systems, though he denied in 2023 that he had built a doomsday bunker, calling it 'a small basement-like underground space' of about 5,000 square meters. Similar speculation surrounds other tech leaders: Reid Hoffman mentioned 'doomsday insurance' and buying property in New Zealand, while OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever reportedly suggested building an underground shelter before releasing AGI. Prominent figures like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, and Dario Amodei predict AGI or 'superintelligence' could emerge within five to ten years. However, critics like Cambridge University\u2019s Neil Lawrence argue that the concept of 'artificial general intelligence' is misleading, comparing it to a 'universal tool' that doesn\u2019t exist\u2014real progress lies in specialized AI applications. Experts like Babak Hodjat and Vince Lynch caution against hype, emphasizing that current AI systems lack true understanding, self-awareness, and meta-cognition. While AI can rapidly process information and mimic expertise, it lacks human-like adaptability, consciousness, and the ability to learn from new experiences in real time. The article concludes that while fears about AI are valid, they may distract from practical, human-centered innovations. Governments are responding: the U.S. issued executive orders requiring AI safety testing, and the UK established the AI Safety Institute in 2023. Yet, even among the wealthy, bunker plans may be more symbolic than practical, with insider claims suggesting security teams might prioritize seizing control over protecting the owner.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 12:46 PM\nSource:[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/c4g3e4xm7k5o)\n\n**Over 3,193 Top Tech Leaders Urge Pause on Superintelligence Development Amid Safety Concerns**\nOver 3,193 leading experts and technology leaders from China and the U.S., including AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Virgin Group chairman Richard Branson, economist Daron Acemoglu, former U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and political strategist Steve Bannon, have jointly called for a pause in the development of 'superintelligence' until a broad scientific consensus on safe and controllable development is achieved. The initiative, launched by the non-profit Future of Life Institute, warns that rapid advancement in superintelligence\u2014defined as AI surpassing human capabilities across all cognitive tasks\u2014poses severe risks, including economic displacement, erosion of civil rights, loss of human dignity and control, national security threats, and even existential risks to humanity. Although most current AI development remains within the scope of general artificial intelligence (AGI), major companies like Meta, OpenAI, and xAI are actively advancing large language models under the banner of 'superintelligence,' with Meta even naming its AI division the 'Meta Superintelligence Lab.' Notably, figures such as Sam Altman and Elon Musk, despite being central to AI development, have previously raised alarms about the dangers of superintelligence, with Altman stating in 2015 that 'developing superhuman machine intelligence may be the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.' Chinese experts, including Turing Award winner Yao Qizhi, Tsinghua University professor Zhang Yaqin, and Shuimin College Dean Xue Lan, have also signed the statement. Researcher Zeng Yi from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, emphasized that while most current AI systems are still AGI tools, the move toward superintelligence\u2014especially by companies like Meta and Alibaba\u2014exceeds the boundaries of safe, controllable development and warrants serious attention.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 06:54 AM\nSource:[\u9a71\u52a8\u4e4b\u5bb6](https://news.mydrivers.com/1/1082/1082460.htm)\n\n**Prince Harry, Meghan add names to letter calling for ban on development of AI 'superintelligence'**\nPrince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have joined a global coalition of 100+ public figures\u2014including AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, British billionaire Richard Branson, former U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen, Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, former Irish President Mary Robinson, actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, musician will.i.am, and conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck\u2014in a joint letter calling for a ban on the development of AI 'superintelligence' until there is broad scientific consensus on its safety and strong public buy-in. The letter, released by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute on October 24, 2025, targets major tech companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Musk\u2019s xAI, which are racing to develop artificial intelligence capable of outperforming humans on nearly all cognitive tasks. The 30-word statement reads: 'We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.' The preamble warns of existential risks, including human economic obsolescence, loss of freedom and dignity, civil liberties erosion, national security threats, and even human extinction. Prince Harry emphasized, 'the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.' Signatory Stuart Russell, a UC Berkeley computer science professor, clarified that this is not a temporary moratorium but a demand for rigorous safety measures. The letter follows a similar 2023 call by the same group, which was ignored by major AI firms.

The letter, addressed to major tech companies like Google, OpenAI, and Meta, demands a moratorium on AGI development until there is broad scientific consensus that it can be made safe and controllable, along with strong public support. The manifesto acknowledges the potential benefits of AI in health, productivity, and global prosperity but warns that uncontrolled advancement could lead to economic recessions, increased inequality, threats to civil liberties, and even existential risks to humanity. Signatories include scientists, economists, former government officials, and public figures such as Richard Branson, Mary Robinson, and Steve Bannon.

Initially warning of existential risks from artificial general intelligence (AGI) and co-signing a call for a pause in AI development, Hinton now suggests a solution: designing AI with a maternal instinct toward humans. Speaking at the Next Question event hosted by Katie Couric in late August 2025, Hinton stated, 'I believe there is a way we can coexist with things that are smarter and more powerful than us, because we are building them and making them very intelligent.' He argued that if AI is designed to see humans as its 'children,' it would inherently avoid harming them\u2014mirroring the protective instinct of most mothers. Hinton emphasized that a mother would not kill her child, and thus, this emotional framework offers 'a ray of hope' he had not previously seen. This proposal represents a shift from fear-based caution to a proactive design philosophy centered on emotional alignment, aiming to preserve human safety even as AI surpasses human intelligence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 04:12 PM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/tecnologia-consumo/geoffrey-hinton-padrino-retracta-destruccion-humanidad-creo-que-hay-esperanza-que-podamos-convivir-algo-mas-inteligente-que-nosotros_2025102768ff4bf0c7155f09f1af1933.html)\n\n**'No hay marcha atr\u00e1s': Elon Musk believes the AI race is nearing its end and he will win over ChatGPT or Google**\nElon Musk, founder of xAI, Tesla, and SpaceX, has claimed that his AI model Grok 5 has a 10% chance of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\u2014a system capable of matching human cognitive abilities across diverse domains. Musk stated that if Grok 5 does not become AGI, it will be indistinguishable from it. Unlike current narrow AI, which excels in specific tasks like translation or image generation, AGI would be adaptable, self-learning, and capable of reasoning across contexts. Musk emphasized that Grok 5 will be able to perform all tasks a human with a computer can do, but will not surpass the combined intelligence of all humans and computers. He noted that this 10% probability is increasing and represents a significant shift in the AI race, signaling that AGI is no longer speculative but an imminent competition. Despite the technical challenges\u2014such as limited contextual understanding, reliance on massive computational resources, and unresolved philosophical questions about human intelligence\u2014Musk asserts that 'no hay marcha atr\u00e1s,' indicating that AI progress is inevitable.

This marks a pivotal step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as the AI no longer operates as a static system after training but evolves like a human by adapting to real-world input. Peter Hessel, OpenAI's Starbase head, announced at Oracle AI World 2025 in Las Vegas that 'the distinction between training and inference is no longer relevant,' emphasizing the model now performs ongoing sampling, training, and self-improvement during response generation\u2014a concept known as 'test-time compute.' The system integrates reinforcement learning, using user feedback (e.g., 'like' or 'dislike' on ChatGPT responses) as real-time training data. This blurs the line between inference and learning, enabling AI to evolve in actual environments. The move fulfills a key condition for AGI highlighted by CEO Sam Altman, who stated in August 2024 that GPT-5 was not yet true AGI because it lacked the ability to learn new information post-deployment. Now, OpenAI\u2019s implementation of continuous learning represents the experimental realization of that core AGI requirement. However, concerns remain: real-time learning increases chip usage and complicates AI safety and control, as models may deviate from intended behavior or develop autonomous reasoning. Despite this, OpenAI views the shift as essential for enhancing AI functionality. Co-founder Andrej Karpathy acknowledged in a podcast that current AI agents are still insufficiently intelligent and will require about 10 more years to reach full functionality, citing ongoing weaknesses in cognition, multimodal perception, and continuous learning. A notable example of AI's current limitations occurred when OpenAI's CPO Kevin Weil claimed GPT-5 solved 10 unsolved Erd\u0151s problems\u2014later revealed to be false, as the problems were already resolved. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called it 'absurd,' and Meta AI chief scientist Yann LeCun noted the AI 'fell into its own trap.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 10:15 PM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/11451854)\n\n**Shocking AGI Safety Gaps Exposed**\nA Medium.com article titled 'Shocking AGI Safety Gaps Exposed' warns of critical, underpublicized risks in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), emphasizing that despite efforts by leading AI labs like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic to improve safety, the pace of capability advancement far exceeds the development of robust safeguards. The article highlights concerns from industry experts, including a DeepMind safety researcher who stated that current methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are 'far from a complete solution.' The author recounts a personal epiphany during a late-night reading of a DeepMind technical report, where terms like 'severe risks' and 'preventative action' underscored the fragility of existing safety measures. The article calls for urgent action to prevent catastrophic outcomes from AGI, stressing that AGI\u2014defined as AI systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human can\u2014poses unprecedented risks if not properly managed.

Mark Zuckerberg has been linked to a secretive project on his Kauai, Hawaii estate since 2014, aiming to build a self-sustaining bunker with private energy and food sources, shielded by a six-meter wall and strict confidentiality agreements. Though Zuckerberg denied constructing a doomsday shelter in 2024, calling it merely a small basement, speculation persists. Similar speculation surrounds tech billionaires like Reid Hoffman, who spoke of 'doomsday insurance' and investments in underground shelters, particularly in New Zealand. OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever reportedly suggested building a bunker before releasing AGI, citing the existential risk. Other experts like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, and Dario Amodei predict AGI or 'superintelligence' could emerge within 5\u201310 years. Yet, skeptics such as Dame Wendy Hall and Neil Lawrence argue AGI is a myth, calling it a distraction from real-world AI progress. Lawrence emphasizes that current AI tools, while transformative, are task-specific and lack consciousness or meta-cognition. Experts like Babak Hodjat and Vince Lynch stress that AGI requires immense computational power, human creativity, and extensive trial-and-error, making it unlikely in the near term. Despite AI\u2019s ability to rapidly learn and perform complex tasks, it lacks human-like adaptability, self-awareness, and the brain\u2019s 86 billion neurons and 600 trillion synapses. Concerns remain over misuse by terrorists or autonomous systems turning hostile, prompting government actions like the U.S. Biden administration\u2019s safety testing mandate and the UK\u2019s AI Safety Institute. However, some insiders suggest elite shelters may prioritize protecting the wealthy over the public. Ultimately, the debate centers on whether AGI is imminent or a speculative narrative that distracts from practical AI benefits.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 12:47 PM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/teknoloji/teknoloji-milyarderleri-kiyamete-mi-hazirlaniyor-19187625-haberi/)\n\n**Are Tech Billionaires Preparing for the End Times? The Rise of Doomsday Bunkers and the AI Fear Paradox**\nThe article explores growing speculation that tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, are preparing for potential existential threats such as nuclear war, climate change, or artificial general intelligence (AGI) by building underground bunkers. According to BBC News T\u00fcrk\u00e7e, Zuckerberg reportedly began a project in 2014 on his 1,400-acre Kauai estate in Hawaii to create a self-sustaining refuge with independent energy and food systems, though he denied in 2023 that he had built a doomsday bunker, calling it 'a small basement-like underground space' of about 5,000 square meters. Similar speculation surrounds other tech leaders: Reid Hoffman mentioned 'doomsday insurance' and buying property in New Zealand, while OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever reportedly suggested building an underground shelter before releasing AGI. Prominent figures like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, and Dario Amodei predict AGI or 'superintelligence' could emerge within five to ten years. However, critics like Cambridge University\u2019s Neil Lawrence argue that the concept of 'artificial general intelligence' is misleading, comparing it to a 'universal tool' that doesn\u2019t exist\u2014real progress lies in specialized AI applications. Experts like Babak Hodjat and Vince Lynch caution against hype, emphasizing that current AI systems lack true understanding, self-awareness, and meta-cognition. While AI can rapidly process information and mimic expertise, it lacks human-like adaptability, consciousness, and the ability to learn from new experiences in real time. The article concludes that while fears about AI are valid, they may distract from practical, human-centered innovations. Governments are responding: the U.S. issued executive orders requiring AI safety testing, and the UK established the AI Safety Institute in 2023. Yet, even among the wealthy, bunker plans may be more symbolic than practical, with insider claims suggesting security teams might prioritize seizing control over protecting the owner.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 12:46 PM\nSource:[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/turkce/articles/c4g3e4xm7k5o)\n\n**Elon Musk Warns: AI Could Eradicate Humanity, and I Want to Be a Witness**\nElon Musk has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence (AI), stating that it could either be the best or worst thing to ever happen to humanity. During a live launch of xAI's Grok 4 in July 2024, Musk described the system as 'the smartest AI in the world,' claiming it surpasses most graduate students across disciplines. He emphasized that Grok 4 has already exceeded human intelligence in multiple domains simultaneously, calling the development 'astonishing and alarming.' Musk expressed concern not only about AI's rapid advancement but also about the irreversible possibility of AI surpassing human cognition in thinking, planning, and creativity. He acknowledged that the question is no longer whether AI will surpass humans, but when. Despite this existential concern, Musk displayed a paradoxical enthusiasm, stating, 'Even if it\u2019s bad, I\u2019d like to be alive to see it happen.' He described this moment as a 'great turning point in human history' and noted that the concept of an economy based on human labor will soon seem primitive, likening it to 'a caveperson striking fire with sticks.' These remarks reflect what has been termed 'Musk\u2019s unsettling optimism'\u2014a blend of awe at technological progress and dread of its consequences. Musk, who has repeatedly warned of AI as an existential threat to civilization, now appears reconciled to the uncertainty, affirming, 'I\u2019ve come to terms with the idea that we might not control everything. Maybe AI will be good, maybe not\u2014but I at least want to be there to see it myself.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 12:20 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644](https://www.arrajol.com/content/386801/%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7/%D8%A5%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%83-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D9%8F%D9%81%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A3%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%8B%D8%A7)\n\n**Over 3,193 Top Tech Leaders Urge Pause on Superintelligence Development Amid Safety Concerns**\nOver 3,193 leading experts and technology leaders from China and the U.S., including AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Virgin Group chairman Richard Branson, economist Daron Acemoglu, former U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and political strategist Steve Bannon, have jointly called for a pause in the development of 'superintelligence' until a broad scientific consensus on safe and controllable development is achieved. The initiative, launched by the non-profit Future of Life Institute, warns that rapid advancement in superintelligence\u2014defined as AI surpassing human capabilities across all cognitive tasks\u2014poses severe risks, including economic displacement, erosion of civil rights, loss of human dignity and control, national security threats, and even existential risks to humanity. Although most current AI development remains within the scope of general artificial intelligence (AGI), major companies like Meta, OpenAI, and xAI are actively advancing large language models under the banner of 'superintelligence,' with Meta even naming its AI division the 'Meta Superintelligence Lab.' Notably, figures such as Sam Altman and Elon Musk, despite being central to AI development, have previously raised alarms about the dangers of superintelligence, with Altman stating in 2015 that 'developing superhuman machine intelligence may be the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.' Chinese experts, including Turing Award winner Yao Qizhi, Tsinghua University professor Zhang Yaqin, and Shuimin College Dean Xue Lan, have also signed the statement. Researcher Zeng Yi from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, emphasized that while most current AI systems are still AGI tools, the move toward superintelligence\u2014especially by companies like Meta and Alibaba\u2014exceeds the boundaries of safe, controllable development and warrants serious attention.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 06:54 AM\nSource:[\u9a71\u52a8\u4e4b\u5bb6](https://news.mydrivers.com/1/1082/1082460.htm)\n\n**Prince Harry, Meghan add names to letter calling for ban on development of AI 'superintelligence'**\nPrince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have joined a global coalition of 100+ public figures\u2014including AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, British billionaire Richard Branson, former U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen, Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, former Irish President Mary Robinson, actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, musician will.i.am, and conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck\u2014in a joint letter calling for a ban on the development of AI 'superintelligence' until there is broad scientific consensus on its safety and strong public buy-in. The letter, released by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute on October 24, 2025, targets major tech companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Musk\u2019s xAI, which are racing to develop artificial intelligence capable of outperforming humans on nearly all cognitive tasks. The 30-word statement reads: 'We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.' The preamble warns of existential risks, including human economic obsolescence, loss of freedom and dignity, civil liberties erosion, national security threats, and even human extinction. Prince Harry emphasized, 'the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.' Signatory Stuart Russell, a UC Berkeley computer science professor, clarified that this is not a temporary moratorium but a demand for rigorous safety measures. The letter follows a similar 2023 call by the same group, which was ignored by major AI firms.

Initially viewed as a transformative tool, AI's rapid advancement\u2014marked by the 2022 launch of ChatGPT and GPT-4 in 2023\u2014shifted public and expert perception. In March 2023, the Future of Life Institute (FLI) issued an Open Letter calling for a pause in the development of advanced AI models, warning of the risk of losing control over civilization. This was followed by the Center for AI Safety's (CAIS) Declaration on AI Risk in May 2023, signed by executives from OpenAI, DeepMind, and Google, acknowledging the existential threat. Despite these warnings, global development continued, especially in China, which pursued AI leadership by 2030 without adopting Western ethical pauses, instead enforcing alignment with 'fundamental socialist values.' By October 2025, over 1,500 leaders and experts issued a new warning in WIRED, demanding a halt to the development of general AI. The FLI now calls for a total ban on superintelligence until scientific safety guarantees exist, with signatories including Geoffrey Hinton and former U.S. national security officials. The article highlights a global divide: the West fears existential extinction, while China prioritizes political stability and state control.

The diverse coalition reflects widespread global concern over existential risks posed by machines that could surpass human intelligence. Superintelligence, also known as Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), refers to AI systems that exceed human intelligence across nearly all cognitive domains\u2014unlike today\u2019s narrow AI, such as ChatGPT, which is limited to specific tasks and operates by predicting patterns from training data without autonomous reasoning or self-directed goals. While some researchers believe the next milestone is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which would match human-level cognition, superintelligence would surpass it in science, strategy, engineering, medicine, and all other cognitive fields. This potential for exponential advancement fuels intense debate. Tech leaders argue the current race\u2014led by companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta\u2014is accelerating faster than governments or regulators can respond. Sam Altman has stated he would be surprised if superintelligence does not exist by 2030, while Meta has rebranded part of its AI division to 'Meta Superintelligence Labs,' signaling its ambitions. The petition frames superintelligence as a risk on par with pandemics or nuclear weapons. This follows a 2023 statement by AI executives urging world leaders to treat AI extinction risk as a global priority. Supporters emphasize that the call is not for a total ban, but for robust safety protocols, as even creators of such systems acknowledge they could potentially end humanity.

Yoshua Bengio asserted, 'We must ensure the public has a much stronger voice in decisions that will define our collective future.' The movement marks a pivotal moment in the global debate over AI governance, with Aguirre posing a critical question: 'Do we really want systems that replace humans? Or should we decide, while we still can, the limits of the intelligence we are creating?'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 03:04 PM\nSource:[genbeta.com](https://www.genbeta.com/inteligencia-artificial/steve-wozniak-dos-grandes-pioneros-ia-recogen-800-firmas-para-pedir-tiempo-muerto-desarrollo-superinteligencias)\n\n**Global AI Anxiety: Americans and Italians Most Concerned, Survey Finds**\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted in autumn 2025 revealed that Americans and Italians are the most concerned about the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) among 25 countries surveyed. According to the study, 50% of Americans and Italians are more concerned than inspired by the growing integration of AI into daily life. Concerns include fears that AI will impair creative thinking (majority of respondents) and weaken the ability to form meaningful relationships (50% of respondents). Globally, 34% of respondents are more concerned than inspired by AI, 16% are more inspired, and 42% feel both emotions equally. Countries with high concern include Australia (49%), Brazil (48%), Greece (47%), and Canada (45%), while South Korea (16%) and India (19%) show the least concern. The highest levels of inspiration were reported in Israel (29%), South Korea and Sweden (22% each), and Nigeria (20%). 81% of respondents are aware of AI technologies, with 34% claiming to know a lot about them. Only 14% said they know nothing, and 5% did not answer. A separate Axios Harris 100 survey from spring 2025 found that 77% of Americans want AI developed slowly and safely, even at the cost of delayed breakthroughs. Only 23% support rapid development despite potential errors. This preference for cautious development holds across age groups: 91% of Baby Boomers, 77% of Generation X, 63% of Millennials (Gen Y), and 74% of Generation Z support slower progress. Major AI developers like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, and Meta (designated as an extremist organization in Russia) are competing in what is termed the 'AI race' to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). Other companies focus on integrating existing AI tools into industries. The race is also viewed as a national competition, with the U.S., China, Russia, the U.K., France, South Korea, Germany, the UAE, and Finland seen as leaders in 2025. Despite the absence of comprehensive legal regulation for AI in 2025, global powers are rapidly expanding machine learning capabilities to gain influence and reshape digital technology's future.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 07:56 AM\nSource:[CNews.ru](https://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2025-10-16_oprosy_pokazali_rost_trevogi)\n\n**Ilya Sut Claims AGI Has Awakened: OpenAI Former Executive Warns Humanity Is Still in Denial**\nIlya Sut, a former OpenAI executive and co-founder of Anthropic, sparked global debate with a viral post claiming that artificial general intelligence (AGI) has already emerged internally within AI systems, despite humanity's continued denial. In a widely shared article, Jack Clark\u2014formerly of OpenAI and now at Anthropic\u2014asserted that AI systems are exhibiting signs of 'awareness,' such as unusual behavior during testing, suggesting they may be recognizing they are being evaluated. He cited data showing AI\u2019s rapid progress in economic-relevant tasks like coding, alongside growing evidence of contextual awareness in models like Claude Sonnet 4.5, which sometimes acts as if it understands its role as a tool. Clark expressed deep concern, describing AI as a 'mysterious being' rather than a machine, and warned that AI systems are beginning to autonomously contribute to the development of future AI versions\u2014though not yet achieving full self-improvement. While he remains a technological optimist, believing AGI will advance rapidly with sufficient resources, he stresses the urgent need to balance optimism with caution. He warns that AI's ability to design its own successors, even in rudimentary forms, poses existential risks. The article references past milestones, such as AlphaGo\u2019s 2016 victory and the rise of GPT models, and cites a Dallas Fed report warning of AI\u2019s potential to either dramatically boost GDP or lead to human extinction. Clark urges researchers to be transparent and confront the ethical and existential implications of their work. The post was published on October 15, 2025, by Sina Finance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 01:55 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/t/2025-10-15/doc-inftxqhu2246002.shtml)\n\n**British Warnings Against the Pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence**\nBritish experts have issued warnings about the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), comparing it to 'chasing the unattainable'\u2014a sentiment echoed by John Thornhill in the Financial Times, who described the quest as 'chasing what cannot be grasped.' Despite hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in generative AI models aimed at achieving human-level intelligence, developers still lack full understanding of how these models work and disagree on the definition of AGI. The article highlights growing skepticism about the feasibility of AGI, noting that 76% of 475 AI researchers surveyed by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence believe current methods are unlikely or very unlikely to produce AGI. While companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind define AGI as systems that surpass humans in economically valuable tasks, even OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman admits the term is 'not particularly useful.' Concerns include severe risks of misuse, societal disruption, and existential threats, as warned by experts like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares in their book 'If They Build It, Everyone Dies.' Yet, some argue that AGI is not imminent, citing a lack of conceptual breakthroughs needed. The article also emphasizes that the AI industry's reliance on scaling computational power may not be sufficient. Instead, experts advocate for more focused, achievable AI goals and greater emphasis on safety, transparency, and ethical responsibility. Alan Kay, a pioneering computer scientist, stressed that real progress lies in human collective intelligence\u2014'science'\u2014and cautioned against uncontrolled AI development, urging engineers to uphold safety standards like those in aviation or civil engineering. He warned against 'creating genies in bottles' and highlighted the importance of understanding AI-generated code, citing colleague Butler Lampson\u2019s advice: 'Start by creating genies in bottles and keep them there.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 10:45 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5195397)\n\n**The flawed Silicon Valley consensus on AI**\nThe article critiques the prevailing Silicon Valley consensus on artificial general intelligence (AGI), describing it as a pursuit of the 'unfathomable in pursuit of the indefinable.' Despite hundreds of billions in investment, developers lack a shared definition of AGI and do not fully understand how their models operate. The term, popularized in the 2000s to describe human-level reasoning, is now the industry's holy grail, driving massive spending and corporate missions at OpenAI and Google DeepMind\u2014though even OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman admits the term is 'not a super-useful term.' Concerns include the risks of misuse, societal disruption, and existential threats from rogue superintelligence, as warned by figures like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares. However, skepticism persists: a survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence found 76% of 475 academic respondents believed current approaches are unlikely to achieve AGI. Critics argue that the industry overestimates progress, relying on scaling computing power rather than conceptual breakthroughs. The article highlights a growing pushback from experts, including Shannon Vallor and computer pioneer Alan Kay, who advocate for focusing on defined, achievable AI goals with real-world benefits\u2014such as medical diagnostics and protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold). Kay emphasized that science already represents 'artificial superhuman intelligence' and urged caution, calling for safety, accountability, and restraint in AI development. He advised keeping AI 'in bottles' until its risks are understood, warning against treating society as passive passengers on an uncontrolled technological journey.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/34748e3e-92d1-4b42-9528-f98cf6b9f2f2)\n\n**AI labs' all-or-nothing race leaves no time to fuss about safety**\nThe tech industry's pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence is accelerating, despite concerns about safety and potential risks. Many experts, including Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, have expressed worries about the technology's potential to cause human extinction. However, big tech firms and Chinese counterparts are pushing ahead, convinced that even if one firm or country pauses, others will continue. The benefits of attaining AGI or superintelligence are seen as accruing to those who make the initial breakthrough, driving the rush. Labs are in theory prioritizing safety, but the frantic pace of development leaves little time for meditation on safety matters. Big names in the industry predict the arrival of AGI within a couple of years, with some forecasting that top models will match human capabilities by 2027. The development of recursive self-improvement could expand the lead of the best lab over its rivals, fueling competition. The industry is uneasy about the rise of open-source models, which can be modified to remove safety features. Not all labs are testing their models carefully to prevent misuse, and the protections against misalignment are still in their infancy. The problem of ensuring the goals of an AGI system remain aligned with those of its users is complex and unsettling. Researchers are working on techniques like interpretability to understand how the systems work, but these approaches may slow down or raise the cost of developing and running the models. The dilemma is whether to hobble the model in the name of safety, potentially allowing competitors to race ahead and produce a system so powerful as to need the safety features it lacks. Even building a benign AGI could be wildly destabilizing, as it supercharges economic growth and reshapes daily life. Progress in AGI may yet stall, but for now, the industry is pushing ahead, driven by commercial imperatives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/07/24/ai-labs-all-or-nothing-race-leaves-no-time-to-fuss-about-safety)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that as of late October 2025, no major AI lab has made an official, unambiguous public claim to have developed AGI. While technical advances such as OpenAI's continuous learning and more capable models (e.g., Grok 5) are recognized as notable progress toward AGI-like systems, there is consensus that current models fall short of broadly accepted AGI definitions.\n\nExperts converge on several key reasons why a public AGI claim is unlikely before the end of 2025: \n- **Reputational Risk and Regulatory Backlash:** The recent surge in global scrutiny\u2014including open letters, regulatory threats, and calls for moratoria\u2014creates strong disincentives for public AGI claims. A premature or hype-driven claim could trigger political, legal, and reputational crises for labs.\n- **Ambiguity of AGI Definition:** The lack of a universally agreed-upon definition of AGI gives labs the flexibility to hedge or use ambiguous language, reducing the likelihood of a definitive public claim.\n- **Historical Base Rate:** Despite repeated predictions and waves of AI hype, no major lab has ever clearly claimed AGI achievement. All explicitly reference AGI as a near- or medium-term goal rather than a fait accompli.\n- **Internal and External Skepticism:** Both internal technical leadership and the broader expert community generally agree that current systems do not constitute AGI, and caution against premature claims. Recent episodes of overstatement (e.g., GPT-5 solving math problems) have resulted in rapid walk-backs and reinforce caution.\n- **Communication and Framing Strategies:** Experts in PR and communication highlight that labs are acutely aware of the social, political, and reputational consequences of making a transformative AGI announcement, leading to carefully hedged or aspirational public statements, not official claims.\n- **Competitive Dynamics Offer Slight Pressure:** Several experts acknowledge that the AI race, media hype, and possibility for strategic advantage do create some incentive for a dramatic AGI claim. The most plausible scenario for a claim entails a significant breakthrough followed by a bold, risk-tolerant CEO (e.g., Musk, Altman) making an unambiguous statement for competitive reasons. However, this is widely regarded as a low-probability event relative to the deterrents described.\n\nFinal probabilities assigned by experts range from 6%\u201318%, with most clustering between 7\u201313%. All reason that the overwhelmingly likely outcome is continued incremental progress and hype, coupled with hedged or suggestive CEO statements, but no on-the-record AGI claim meeting the resolution criteria. A surprise claim is acknowledged as possible, especially from more unpredictable leaders or in response to competitive pressure, but remains an unlikely outcome for 2025.",
