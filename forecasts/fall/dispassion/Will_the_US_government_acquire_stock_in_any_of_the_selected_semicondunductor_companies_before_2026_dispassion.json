Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology are still in play, and political reporting indicates the White House is actively seeking further pre-election deals. However, the process is fraught: legal ambiguity, corporate and foreign resistance (especially from South Korea for Samsung), and the risk of destabilizing investment climate act as brakes. Still, the administration\u2019s demonstrated willingness to act, the absence of explicit exemptions for at least two companies, and the strong political incentives to secure a symbolic win increase the chances above base rate. On balance, given status quo inertia but with strong political will and some precedent, I estimate a solid minority chance\u2014higher than base rate but not overwhelming.",

TSMC, in particular, has threatened to return subsidies rather than accept government ownership, and both political and strategic rationales align for the administration to avoid a confrontation with TSMC or Micron. That leaves Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology as the most likely targets. Samsung has received billions in subsidies but is continuing to expand in Texas; it is not explicitly exempt, and the administration may see political value in striking a deal. The reporting suggests companies fear retaliation and are under pressure, but also that legal and administrative challenges could slow the process. With about 2.5 months remaining and strong political incentives to announce deals before the midterms, there is a substantial chance that at least one equity stake is acquired, most likely in Samsung or a smaller firm. Nevertheless, the combination of explicit carve-outs for TSMC and Micron, the potential for companies to avoid equity by increasing US investment or returning subsidies, and the legal/operational friction involved means that the outcome is far from certain. A base rate for abrupt, high-profile new government equity stakes in the US is low, but the policy break represented by the Intel deal and the administration\u2019s urgency justifies a material probability.

Recent reporting and official statements show the White House is reaching out to dozens of firms, and the Intel deal has already broken substantial precedent, indicating a willingness to push through legal and corporate resistance. While TSMC and Micron are indeed exempt, Samsung (and to a lesser extent, Global Foundries or Microchip Technology) are in more ambiguous positions and have not been publicly removed from consideration. The critique is that your probability (25%) is too low given: (1) the sharply increased policy tempo, (2) the administration\u2019s clear appetite for further equity deals, and (3) the lack of public carve-outs for Samsung, which remains a plausible and politically valuable target.

Rest assured, we did not discuss this issue during this round of talks, nor would we agree to such conditions.' The rejection comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions and U.S. efforts to relocate critical chip manufacturing to American soil. The Trump administration had previously urged Taiwan to shift half of its production to the U.S., and just before Taiwan's refusal, President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick demanded that 50% of chips used in America be manufactured domestically, warning that Taiwan risks losing U.S. defense guarantees if it does not comply. Despite TSMC\u2019s $165 billion investment in Arizona chip factories, the majority of its production will remain in Taiwan. Additionally, TSMC denied rumors of potential investments or partnerships with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), quashing speculation about a resolution to U.S. demands. Meanwhile, President Lai Ching-te announced plans to purchase $10 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products\u2014such as soybeans, wheat, corn, and beef\u2014over the next four years. Taiwan currently holds a substantial trade surplus with the U.S. and is subject to a 20% tariff on its exports to the U.S.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:58 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/10/47961096/taiwan-rejects-us-proposal-for-50-50-chip-production-deal-never-made-any-commitment)\n\n**Trump Administration Cancels $10 Trillion Semiconductor Fund, Casting Uncertainty Over Industry and Samsung's Projects**\nThe U.S. semiconductor industry faces renewed uncertainty after the Trump administration announced the cancellation of a $740 million (approximately 10 trillion KRW) research and development (R&D) fund for the nonprofit group Natcast, which had been established under the Biden administration. The fund, intended to support semiconductor R&D infrastructure and workforce training, is now effectively defunct, with its projects on hold. The U.S. Department of Commerce, led by Secretary Howard Lutnick, labeled the initiative a 'slush fund for Biden loyalists' and cited lack of legal basis, prompting a reversal of funding. While the CHIPS and Science Act's direct subsidies\u2014such as the $4.745 billion awarded to Samsung Electronics for expanding semiconductor facilities in Taylor and Austin, Texas\u2014are still being implemented normally, the broader uncertainty has caused major industry players like Intel, IBM, and AMD to remain silent. Industry sources report widespread fear among companies that opposing the administration could lead to adverse outcomes in future subsidy reviews. Experts warn the move undermines the bipartisan consensus behind the CHIPS Act and may destabilize corporate investment strategies in the U.S. The situation is particularly concerning amid intense global semiconductor competition and escalating U.S.-China tensions. Samsung\u2019s $37 billion private investment plan and local job creation commitments remain on track, but the overall climate of unpredictability is causing concern across the sector.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 02:20 AM\nSource:[First-Class \uacbd\uc81c\uc2e0\ubb38 \ud30c\uc774\ub0b8\uc15c\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.fnnews.com/news/202510011055365776)\n\n**U.S. and Taiwan Advance Toward Key Semiconductor Agreement for National Security**\nU.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick announced that a critical semiconductor agreement with Taiwan is imminent, aiming to increase domestic chip production in the United States to 40% as a strategic response to China's growing influence and geopolitical risks. Lutnick emphasized that the current reliance on Taiwan\u2014where over 95% of U.S. chips are manufactured\u2014is unsustainable, especially given China's stated intent to 'conquer Taiwan.' He highlighted that Taiwan produces more than 60% of global semiconductors and nearly 92% of advanced logic chips below 5 nanometers, which are vital for AI, high-performance computing, and defense systems. The U.S. government, under the Trump administration, is pushing for greater supply chain independence through proposed 'chips 1:1' regulations that would impose 100% tariffs on imported chips unless matched by domestic production. This effort builds on the CHIPS and Science Act passed under Biden. TSMC, Taiwan\u2019s leading chipmaker, is already investing $100 billion over five years in the U.S., including facilities in Arizona, and currently produces N4 chips there, with plans to support N3 and N2 nodes by 2028\u20132029. However, Taiwan remains resistant to transferring its most advanced 2nm fabrication technology abroad, maintaining its leadership in cutting-edge processes. The U.S. relies heavily on TSMC for high-performance silicon used by companies like Nvidia and Apple. A disruption in Taiwan\u2019s production\u2014due to conflict or geopolitical instability\u2014could cause catastrophic economic consequences, as seen during the pandemic chip shortage. Despite the urgency, full diversification remains unfeasible in the short to medium term due to Taiwan\u2019s tightly guarded technological edge.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 09:57 PM\nSource:[El Diario Nueva York](https://eldiariony.com/2025/09/30/ee-uu-y-taiwan-avanzan-hacia-un-acuerdo-de-semiconductores-clave-para-la-seguridad-nacional/)\n\n**Trump and Lutnick Demand Half of U.S. Chips Be Made at Home - Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)**\nPresident Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have demanded that half of all chips used in the United States be manufactured domestically, asserting that semiconductor production is critical to national security. They have pressured Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSMC) to relocate a significant portion of its advanced chip production to the U.S., warning that failure to do so could jeopardize American defense guarantees to Taiwan. Lutnick argued that Taiwan\u2019s dominance in advanced chip fabrication creates economic vulnerability and undermines the U.S. 'silicon shield,' making access to essential military and industrial chips precarious. The administration has proposed steep tariffs on imported chips, a potential '1:1' production rule requiring domestic output to match imports, and a major investment plan from TSMC for new U.S. fabrication and packaging facilities. Lutnick stated that U.S. military support for Taiwan is contingent on these supply chain adjustments. In a direct intervention, the Trump administration acquired a 10% stake in Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) in August 2025 through an $8.9 billion investment, converting unspent CHIPS Act funds into equity to strengthen Intel\u2019s foundry business. This move marks a significant shift toward state-led industrial policy, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign semiconductors, restructure global supply chains, and align economic security with national defense.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 03:12 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/09/47946110/trump-and-lutnick-demand-half-of-americas-chips-must-be-made-at-home-or-else)\n\n**Trump And Lutnick Demand: Half Of America's Chips Must Be Made At Home\u2014Or Else**\nPresident Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have demanded that half of all chips used in the United States be manufactured domestically, asserting that semiconductor production is critical to national security.

The White House aims to reduce reliance on foreign chips, restructure global supply chains, and integrate economic security with national defense.

Trump administration officials have reportedly held discussions with dozens of companies deemed critical to national or economic security, offering incentives such as tariff reductions, income guarantees, and equity stakes in struggling firms. These efforts are designed to help President Donald Trump demonstrate political victories leading up to the 2026 midterms, with agreements expected to be publicly announced by the White House. The administration aims to incentivize companies to shift production to the United States, reduce operations in China, strengthen government coffers, and secure supply chains for critical goods. Key sectors targeted include semiconductors, energy, battery production, artificial intelligence, and transportation. Pharmaceutical executives, White House staff, and officials from organizations like Health & Services have reportedly received frequent outreach. As part of this initiative, the White House has tasked the International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), a federal agency, to oversee and finance the plan. The IDFC submitted a proposal in June to increase its funding authority from $60 billion to $250 billion, though Congress has not yet approved it. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is viewed as Trump\u2019s primary negotiator, having previously overseen many of the administration\u2019s largest deals, including a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel and the 'golden share' provision enabling Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel earlier this year.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 10:52 AM\nSource:[Investing.com T\u00fcrkiye](https://tr.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/beyaz-saray-ara-secimler-oncesi-cesitli-sektorlerde-anlasmalar-hedefliyor-3564331)\n\n**Taiwan Rejects U.S. Proposal for 50-50 Chip Production Split, Citing Strategic and Geopolitical Risks**\nTaiwan has firmly rejected the idea of a 50-50 split in semiconductor production with the United States, calling the proposal 'far-fetched' and stating that the topic was never discussed during a delegation visit to Washington on October 1, 2025. Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun explicitly confirmed that Taiwan will not agree to such a division, emphasizing that it would go against the spirit of U.S.-Taiwan cooperation. The proposal originated from U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who, on September 27, 2025, suggested that the U.S. must reclaim half of global chip production. However, Taiwan\u2019s government and domestic political parties have united in opposition, viewing the idea as a threat to its strategic position. Taiwan\u2019s dominance in advanced semiconductor manufacturing\u2014led by TSMC, which held 53% of the global foundry market in 2021 and produced 92% of the world\u2019s most advanced chips in 2019\u2014underpins its geopolitical leverage. TSMC operates 18 facilities in Taiwan, with additional plants in China (2), the U.S. (2), and Japan (1). In response to Donald Trump\u2019s return to the presidency and his pro-business, reindustrialization agenda, TSMC plans to invest $100 billion more in U.S. chip production, on top of $65 billion already committed to a plant in Phoenix, Arizona. Taiwan\u2019s resistance stems from its 'silicon shield' strategy: by remaining the indispensable hub of global semiconductor supply, it deters potential Chinese invasion, as any attack would disrupt critical global tech infrastructure. The world has repeatedly paused during regional seismic events\u2014such as a 7.2\u20137.5 magnitude earthquake in 2024 near Taiwan\u2014due to fears of supply chain collapse.

The Biden administration established the nonprofit Natcast, a national semiconductor technology center, to lead semiconductor research and development (R&D), with over 200 companies including NVIDIA, Intel, and Samsung Electronics participating and managing a $7.4 billion fund. However, under the Trump administration, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick labeled Natcast a 'Biden loyalist slush fund' and revoked its federal funding, citing a new Department of Justice interpretation that the organization was illegally established with weak legal foundations. Lutnick asserted federal control over the funds, leading to the suspension of Natcast\u2019s projects and the termination of over 90% of its 110 employees. Promised investments of billions of dollars to states like Arizona are now uncertain. The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced it will restart the selection process for subsidy recipients from the beginning, creating widespread uncertainty in the industry. Major firms such as Intel, IBM, and AMD are contacting Commerce Department officials to secure support, but most are refraining from public criticism due to fear of retaliation. Some analysts suggest the Trump administration may be redirecting funds to politically favorable regions, with close allies dominating the funding oversight committee, raising concerns about transparency and conflicts of interest. The Trump administration claims it will restructure the program under stricter conditions, potentially demanding equity stakes from companies, prompting concerns about excessive government intervention.

The first major deal was with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), where the US government converted nearly $11 billion in Chips Act grants into a 10% equity stake, leading to a stock price surge of over 25%. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the approach, stating it is a mistake to provide grants without securing returns. In July, the US Defense Department acquired $400 million (\u00a3297.7 million) in shares of MP Materials (NYSE: MP), making it the largest shareholder; the company described the arrangement as a 'public-private partnership,' and its stock nearly doubled after the announcement. The next target is Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC), where the Trump Administration plans to acquire a 10% stake as part of a renegotiation of a $2.2 billion (\u00a31.6 billion) government loan for the Thacker Pass lithium project, expected to become operational in 2028. Reports indicate Trump is also pushing General Motors to cede control over parts of the project to Washington. Lithium Americas' stock nearly doubled in a single day following the news. Trump is also considering a stake in Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), with Lutnick stating the company is 'essentially an arm of the US government' due to its 97% revenue from the US government, though the deal remains unconfirmed. Lockheed Martin shares have risen over 7% in the past month. Trump has defended the policy, saying, 'It's not a shame, that's called business,' in late August.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 07:59 PM\nSource:[International Business Times](https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-turns-uncle-sam-shareholder-inside-his-shock-11b-intel-stake-companies-next-his-list-3784892)\n\n**Trump and Lutnick Demand Half of U.S. Chips Be Made at Home - Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)**\nPresident Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have demanded that half of all chips used in the United States be manufactured domestically, asserting that semiconductor production is critical to national security. They have pressured Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSMC) to relocate a significant portion of its advanced chip production to the U.S., warning that failure to do so could jeopardize American defense guarantees to Taiwan. Lutnick argued that Taiwan\u2019s dominance in advanced chip fabrication creates economic vulnerability and undermines the U.S. 'silicon shield,' making access to essential military and industrial chips precarious. The administration has proposed steep tariffs on imported chips, a potential '1:1' production rule requiring domestic output to match imports, and a major investment plan from TSMC for new U.S. fabrication and packaging facilities. Lutnick stated that U.S. military support for Taiwan is contingent on these supply chain adjustments. In a direct intervention, the Trump administration acquired a 10% stake in Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) in August 2025 through an $8.9 billion investment, converting unspent CHIPS Act funds into equity to strengthen Intel\u2019s foundry business. This move marks a significant shift toward state-led industrial policy, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign semiconductors, restructure global supply chains, and align economic security with national defense.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 03:12 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/09/47946110/trump-and-lutnick-demand-half-of-americas-chips-must-be-made-at-home-or-else)\n\n**Trump And Lutnick Demand: Half Of America's Chips Must Be Made At Home\u2014Or Else**\nPresident Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have demanded that half of all chips used in the United States be manufactured domestically, asserting that semiconductor production is critical to national security.

According to a Wall\u202fStreet\u202fJournal article dated August\u202f21, 2025, the policy discussion was sparked by Commerce Secretary Howard\u202fLutnick\u2019s public statement on August\u202f19 that the government was studying the possibility of taking a 10\u202f% stake in Intel. A senior, unnamed government official told the Wall\u202fStreet\u202fJournal that the Commerce Department \"does not intend to take equity from TSMC and Micron.\" The decision to require equity depends on whether a company has pledged additional U.S. investment after receiving subsidies. TSMC, a major beneficiary of the Chips Act, has already pledged a $100\u202fbillion investment in the U.S., including three new fabs in Arizona on top of a prior $65\u202fbillion commitment; this large investment is cited as the reason the administration will likely exempt it from equity demands. The Chips Act totals $52.7\u202fbillion in subsidies, of which $6.6\u202fbillion has been disbursed to TSMC. Other major recipients include Intel, Micron and Samsung. The article notes that the U.S. has historically used equity stakes to support strategic industries during economic uncertainty, and that the current consideration reflects a focus on the semiconductor sector\u2019s strategic importance and efficient use of subsidy funds.

However, Trump officials say the administration has no plans to take shares in U.S.\u2011expanding semiconductor firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) or Micron.  Business Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on August\u202f19 that the Trump administration is negotiating with Intel to acquire a 10\u202f% stake and may apply the same approach to other firms.  Lutnick said the Biden administration \"\u7b49\u65bc\u514d\u8cbb\u70ba\u82f1\u7279\u723e\u3001\u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb\u7b49\u516c\u53f8\u9001\u9322\uff0c\u5ddd\u666e\u5247\u626d\u8f49\u5c40\u9762\uff0c\u8b8a\u6210\u653f\u5e9c\u63d0\u4f9b\u88dc\u52a9\u4e4b\u5f8c\u8981\u53d6\u5f97\u80a1\u6b0a\u3002\"  The move has raised concerns among tech executives, who fear that the administration could take stakes in major chip makers like TSMC, Micron, and Samsung.  In July, the Trump administration acquired a 15\u202f% stake in a rare\u2011earth materials producer.  TSMC received a 6.6\u202fbillion\u2011yuan U.S. subsidy to build a large advanced\u2011chip plant in Arizona, which began production at the end of 2024.  Officials say the administration does not intend to demand equity from companies that are expanding in the U.S., but may require it for companies that receive subsidies.  Lutnick has long pushed for companies receiving Chips Act funds to increase their U.S. investment to secure better terms for taxpayers.  Converting subsidies into equity could face legal challenges, though the Chips Act mandates profit sharing when profits exceed a threshold.  The Trump administration's intervention has caused anxiety among industry leaders, who fear becoming the next target.  Nvidia and AMD have recently agreed to share 15\u202f% of revenue from chip sales to China with the U.S. government.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 06:28 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6813/8956284)\n\n**How Trump will decide which Chips Act companies must give up equity**\nCommerce Secretary Howard\u202fLutnick said the Biden administration is in talks to take a 10\u202f% equity stake in Intel and may consider similar stakes in other chip makers such as TSMC, Micron and Samsung.  He explained that the administration has already taken a 15\u202f% stake in a rare\u2011earth producer and that it wants equity in exchange for subsidies when companies do not increase their U.S. investment.  Lutnick told CNBC that \"The Biden administration literally was giving Intel [money] for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies, just giving them money for free,\" and that under a Trump\u2011era approach the government would \"want a piece of the action\" for the money it provides.  TSMC, which received up to $6.6\u202fbillion in subsidies for a new Arizona plant, has said it has never relied heavily on U.S. financial support and would hand back subsidies if asked to become a stockholder.  The Commerce Department has stated it is not looking to take equity from TSMC or Micron, but it is encouraging companies that receive Chips Act grants to raise their total U.S. investment in hopes of negotiating better terms for taxpayers.  The Chips Act, which authorizes tens of billions of dollars in grants, loans and subsidies to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturing, has been criticized for its slow implementation and for the administration\u2019s willingness to reward or punish firms based on their U.S. investment levels.  Trump\u2019s recent policy of exempting companies that spend more in the U.S. from roughly 100\u202f% tariffs on chip imports and the government\u2019s 15\u202f% cut of sales to China from Nvidia and AMD illustrate the political stakes involved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 03:45 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/global/how-trump-will-decide-which-chips-act-companies-must-give-up-equity-11755834148831.html)\n\n**US Reportedly Goes Selective In Taking Stakes In Big Chips After Trump Administration Confirms 10% Intel Investment**\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the U.S. government is in talks to take a 10% stake in Intel and may pursue similar deals elsewhere, while clarifying that firms such as TSMC and Micron, which are expanding U.S. operations, would not be targeted. The article notes that the Trump administration last month took a 15% stake in rare\u2011earth producer MP Materials and has ordered chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to give the government 15% of their China sales. It also reports that TSMC, which received up to $6.6\u202fbillion for its Arizona plant that began production in 2024, has discussed returning subsidies if the U.S. sought an equity stake. Lutnick has urged grant recipients to raise U.S. spending, including Intel, which is negotiating whether part of its CHIPS funding could be converted into equity. Trump has clashed with Intel leadership, urging CEO Lip\u2011Bu Tan to resign over China ties. The Chips Act, first introduced during Trump's earlier term, authorized tens of billions to boost U.S. semiconductor production but has been slowed by tariff disputes and implementation delays. Any equity deals could face legal challenges since the law already requires profit\u2011sharing above certain thresholds. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment was 'bullish' for Nvidia with 'normal' message volume, while sentiment for Advanced Micro Devices was 'bearish' with 'low' message volume.

However, officials told the WSJ that the department \"does not intend to take equity in TSMC or Micron,\" and that companies that do not raise their commitments may be required to offer equity in return for subsidies. TSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple among its key customers, announced a $100\u202fbillion investment in the United States at a White\u202fHouse event in March, adding to the $65\u202fbillion already pledged for three manufacturing plants in Arizona. The U.S. Treasury\u2019s CHIPS Act, which allocated $52.7\u202fbillion, approved $6.6\u202fbillion in subsidies for TSMC\u2019s U.S. production last year.

According to CNBC, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government is negotiating a 10% stake in struggling chipmaker Intel and may consider similar equity for other chip companies. Lutnick stated, 'The Biden administration is basically giving money to Intel, to TSMC, to all these companies. The Trump administration\u2019s stance is, \u2018Hey, we want equity. If we provide financial support, we must get corresponding rights.\u2019' This statement heightened concerns among industry executives that the U.S. government might also take equity in major manufacturers such as TSMC, Micron, and Samsung. Last month, the U.S. government acquired a 15% stake in a rare\u2011earth materials producer. TSMC, which received up to $6.6\u202fbillion in U.S. subsidies for building a large chip plant in Arizona that began production in late 2024, may return subsidies if forced to become a shareholder. A government official clarified that the U.S. does not intend to take equity in companies like TSMC that are increasing U.S. investment, but companies that have not committed additional investment may need to exchange equity for subsidies. The CHIPS Act provides hundreds of billions in subsidies, loans, and other incentives to encourage companies such as Intel and TSMC to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. The Trump administration has indicated that companies increasing U.S. investment could be exempt from approximately 100% import tariffs on chips. However, converting Intel\u2019s CHIPS Act funds into equity could face legal challenges, as the Act requires companies to share profits above a certain threshold with the government.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 12:09 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8m1BMUaUdTQ)\n\n**US Government Considers Acquiring Stakes in Major Semiconductor Companies**\nThe US government, led by Donald Trump, is considering acquiring a stake in several major semiconductor companies, including Micron, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), and Samsung, which have received billions of dollars in subsidies under the Chips Act. According to Reuters, the administration is looking to acquire a 10% stake in Intel, which has already been confirmed by Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson. Howard Lutnick, the US Secretary of Commerce, is working on an agreement with Intel to acquire the stake. This move could mark a significant change in the US government's approach to the private sector, as the administration is no longer hesitant to directly intervene in the capital of major companies. The administration is also considering acquiring stakes in Micron, TSMC, and Samsung, which have been beneficiaries of the Chips Act. The Chips Act, passed in 2022, aimed to encourage semiconductor manufacturers worldwide to open factories in the US, a goal shared by Donald Trump. The administration is seeking to reduce the US's dependence on Asia, where most semiconductor manufacturers are based. As of January 2025, over $33 billion in subsidies had been awarded, with $4.745 billion going to Samsung, $7.86 billion to Intel, $6.6 billion to TSMC, and $6.1 billion to Micron. According to the US Secretary of Commerce, it's time for the return on investment: 'Imagine this: the Biden administration gave Intel free money, gave TSMC free money, (...).

This move would mark a historic shift in US industrial policy, giving the government direct influence over companies key to national security. As reported, the White House has already confirmed talks with Intel on a potential 10% stake. Lutnick, backed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, has pushed the approach, which has been signaled as supported by Trump.

    "date": "2025-10-15T01:41:25.222749",
    "summary": "Across the spectrum of expert perspectives, there is broad agreement that the Trump administration\u2019s equity-for-subsidy approach\u2014demonstrated by the Intel deal\u2014marks a significant and unusual shift in US industrial policy, raising the base rate for government equity stakes in semiconductor companies for the duration of the forecast window. All experts concur that TSMC and Micron are explicitly exempt from government equity demands due to their large US investments, as repeatedly stated by administration officials and reflected in public statements and reporting. The focus, therefore, is on Samsung (and its US subsidiaries), Global Foundries, and Microchip Technology as plausible targets for equity deals before the end of 2025.\n\nMost forecasters cite the strong political incentive to secure further public 'wins' ahead of the 2026 midterms, which increases the likelihood of additional equity deals, especially as a means of leveraging subsidy disbursements. The precedent set by the Intel deal and the administration\u2019s recent actions in other strategic sectors (such as rare earths) support the plausibility of such moves. At the same time, legal hurdles, potential industry/foreign government resistance (with threats to return subsidies), and historical US reticence to direct equity holdings outside periods of acute crisis are seen as significant constraints, particularly for Samsung, which could plausibly negotiate an exemption or resist due to its size and strategic alternatives.\n\nForecasts diverge mainly in their assessment of the likelihood that these factors result in a government equity acquisition before the resolution date. Probabilities offered range from 25% to 75%, with several experts clustering around 33-38% (leaning toward no new deals, but acknowledging a significant chance), while others, emphasizing the administration's aggressiveness and the narrow window for political gains, project likelihoods above 60%, with one outlier at 75%.\n\nThe most likely 'Yes' scenario, cited by nearly all, is an equity agreement with Samsung, its US subsidiary, or a smaller player such as Global Foundries or Microchip Technology in the coming months\u2014motivated by the administration\u2019s need for a political win and enabled by the willingness to push legal boundaries and use leverage over ongoing subsidies or regulatory approvals. The 'No' scenario is seen as more plausible if the targeted companies negotiate exemptions (as TSMC and Micron did), threaten to return subsidies, or successfully delay any deal beyond the resolution date, aided by legal uncertainty or effective pushback from industry and Congress.\n\nIn summary, forecasters generally assess the odds of the US government acquiring stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026 as meaningfully higher than historical base rates, mainly due to the Trump administration\u2019s declared policy and political incentives. Yet, the explicit exemption of the two largest firms and the headwinds of legal and industry resistance limit the probability, with Samsung singled out as the most probable target for further government equity acquisition if any deal occurs.",
