Tariff effects are still flowing through, and while some price gains are absorbed by margins, there\u2019s evidence this buffering is increasingly limited as 2025 progresses. The policy impulse from Trump (tariff, fiscal, immigration) remains inflationary in the short run. On the disinflationary side, recent data show a shockingly weak labor market with much higher unemployment and subdued job growth, implying real demand may soon falter. Some PPI and core inflation data are coming in cooler than expected, and there are signs\u2014if the labor market deteriorates further\u2014that headline CPI could decelerate into late 2025.

(2) Most recent rapid inflation upcycles have ended with subsequent YoY prints lower than the prior year, especially when labor markets turn decisively negative. (3) The stickiness of recent tariff-driven inflation is real, but business absorption and evidence from the PPI suggest this shock is dissipating, not compounding. (4) Fed policy is not aggressively stimulative; forward guidance indicates a moderate easing path, and real rates remain structurally positive. (5) Economic consensus and models (CBO, Moody\u2019s) forecast 2025 inflation modestly above 3% for the full year, but CPI already peaked above 2.7% in mid-2025, raising the bar for a higher November-to-November number. (6) News consensus and labor data suggest that recession risk/demand-driven disinflation outweighs the risk of another inflation surge barring an energy shock or further supply chain breakdowns. Therefore, the most likely outcome is a headline CPI YoY in November 2025 that is below the November 2024 value of 2.73%, probably in the 2.0\u20132.6% range.

The Federal Reserve is beginning to cut rates, under pressure from both economic data and political actors, but markets and the Fed remain wary of stoking fresh inflation. Professional economic forecasts (e.g., CBO) suggest an annual 2025 average inflation rate of 3.1%, which would imply that absent major disinflation, the November 2025 print could be at or above the previous year\u2019s 2.73%. That said, labor market weakness historically exerts strong downward pressure on inflation. Given the high current reading, softening economy, Fed cuts, and the possibility of base effects lowering YoY inflation with modestly weak monthly prints, I estimate the probability of a lower CPI in November 2025 than in November 2024 to be somewhat less than even but not extremely low. The base rate for annual CPI retracements during times of sharply rising unemployment is non-negligible, but with current prints elevated, the path to a 'Yes' resolution relies on quite rapid disinflation by late 2025\u2014which is plausible, but not the most likely outcome by default. I assign a final probability of 35%, reflecting how the status quo (recently rising inflation) and explicit policy-induced price pressures make a higher November 2025 CPI slightly more probable, but labor market and base effect risks temper that.",

Importantly, your position seems to underweight the actual mechanics of inflation stickiness in the context of simultaneous tariff, immigration, and fiscal shocks. Forward guidance is a valuable framework, but it cannot overcome hard fundamentals: services and shelter inflation are exceptionally persistent, and the lag between labor market slack and realized CPI disinflation may extend past the question's resolution window. Lastly, the softening in pipeline price data (such as PPI) is indeed encouraging, but in historical analogues, even pronounced PPI collapses don't guarantee immediate CPI reversals when supply shocks dominate and expectations take time to adjust.

Second, you judge the pass-through of tariffs as relatively shallow based on recent PPI/wholesale trends and margin compression, yet the literature and real-world data suggest that as time passes and input buffers deplete, the pressure to pass costs on to consumers intensifies, supporting ongoing stickiness in CPI\u2014especially major weight categories like shelter and services.

Moreover, your reasoning astutely notes the potential for policy lags to miss the window; interest rate cuts that begin in September may not exert strong downward pressure on YoY CPI until late in or after the relevant period. The weighting of base rates, recent CPI momentum, and unique cyclical factors justifies a forecast in the 40% range\u2014recognizing genuine two-sided risk and refusing to push too far toward either extreme without more decisive evidence of monthly CPI moderation.

By stressing that much of the tariff-induced price pressure has proven to be a one-time shock and that pass-through is peaking, you make a strong case that realized inflation is likely to subside as slack accumulates and sequential monthly prints moderate. Furthermore, your attention to the historical post-shock pattern\u2014where inflation declines 6-18 months after the initial level increase unless re-shocked\u2014closely matches both my base rate analysis and the mechanism by which expectations containment precludes further rounds of price acceleration. The only caveat I\u2019d add is that sudden unanchoring of expectations is always a risk if policy credibility breaks, but, so far, all evidence suggests this is not occurring. Your forecast, weighted toward a Yes, is consistent with both the empirical record and the core features of the inflation expectations framework."

However, the historical evidence on Phillips Curve efficacy during periods of large and simultaneous supply and policy shocks is mixed. First, cost-push shocks (tariffs, supply constraints) tend to keep headline inflation elevated and slow to revert, even in the face of labor market slack, due to the persistence of core service and shelter inflation and the delayed pass-through to final consumer prices. Second, recent headline CPI data show renewed acceleration rather than deceleration, casting doubt on the immediacy and strength of demand-pull disinflation before late 2025. Third, expansionary fiscal policy may curtail the disinflationary effect of labor market slack. While you are right to weight labor slack as disinflationary, base rates for stickiness post-policy/supply shock situations suggest caution about a rapid drop. Moderate probability for a Yes outcome is justified; two-thirds strikes me as too aggressive relative to the current evidence and base rates."

The recent upward trend in inflation prints, combined with only tentative signs of disinflation ahead, should be weighted heavily\u2014especially given empirical evidence that cost shocks layered alongside active political interference and high uncertainty create inertia in realized inflation. Several other forecasters place higher probabilities on a rapid fall in CPI; however, this ignores the complexity of path dependence and the asymmetric risk that shocks get prolonged when the policy environment is unpredictable and central bank independence is questioned. Your skepticism about the immediacy of disinflation, despite some negative labor signals, is appropriate for this environment."

However, the more in-depth reading of PPI/wholesale pipeline data, and the historical observation that YoY CPI rarely stays elevated after sharp employment declines, increase the likelihood that the one-off nature of recent inflation shocks combines with aggregate demand weakness for rapid roll-off by November. My critique of the Monetarist position stands\u2014the tail risks of inflation persistence are very real\u2014but group consensus signals that my baseline was likely too anchored to status quo stickiness rather than the probability of sharp inflection in the data.

The consensus among forecasters is less extreme than my initial forecast and, in particular, strong arguments were raised that both upside and downside risks have grown. Although my initial viewpoint remains supported\u2014that the risk balance favors lower CPI in November 2025\u2014I now judge a modestly higher risk of stickiness due to persistent cost-push factors and less-than-decisive monetary/fiscal offset.

Additionally, the persistence of elevated YoY prints in mid-2025 (currently 2.9% in August), and the structure of the CPI basket, suggest it will require sustained, significant monthly retrenchment for November 2025 to fall below 2.73%. The upside inflation risks posed by ongoing policy and demographic shocks exceed the downside risks from a slackening labor market\u2014if only modestly.

There is also broad agreement that the initial tariff shock is increasingly being absorbed by firms or is not producing a compounding effect on CPI. The main contrarian perspective, citing annual model forecasts (CBO, Moody's) averaging above 2.7%, could be overweighting the lagged, annual nature of those forecasts as compared to the November-to-November window under consideration, with recent PPI and pipeline price data already rolling over. Furthermore, forecasters note that Federal Reserve easing may cushion CPI but is unlikely to reignite it given the magnitude of demand weakness.

Conversely, the most hawkish No forecaster (CBO) likely overstates stickiness, given the speed of labor weakening. My critique of the Interest Rate Transmission view holds: while policy lags are relevant, the combined effects of weakening demand and increased business absorption of tariffs may make my prior 75% (No) a bit too extreme. There remains structural cost-push inflation, but the disinflation risk is higher than I allowed.

The shift began this summer when two Fed governors dissented in July, arguing that the job market warranted a rate cut, and continued as other officials downplayed inflation and focused on an economy that was slowing and at risk of shedding jobs.  The latest data show the unemployment rate rose to 4.3\u202f% in August and the economy actually lost jobs in June following a revision.  A benchmark employment revision this week indicated nearly a million fewer jobs were added in the year through March than originally reported.  Consumer prices in August rose faster than the prior month, while initial jobless\u2011benefits claims jumped in the latest week, signalling a cooling labor market.  \"The Fed should cut 50 basis points next week\u2026Labor market conditions are cooling more rapidly than they were to start the year,\" wrote Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.  Market analysts, including 105 of 107 economists in a recent Reuters poll, expect only a quarter\u2011percentage\u2011point cut next week, but the new data could lead officials to project a quicker and steadier drop in rates as they shift from guarding against inflation to defending the job market.

The last quarterly projections in June had Fed officials anticipating two quarter\u2011percentage\u2011point rate cuts this year, but seven of the 19 anticipated no moves as they weighed how Trump\u2019s tariffs might complicate efforts to return inflation to the 2\u202f% target.  While data this summer has eased concerns about stagflation, it has raised uneasiness about the direction of the job market.  The pass\u2011through of tariffs to consumer prices has been more tempered than expected, and although inflation is expected to accelerate this year, policymakers have become more comfortable with the idea that any tariff\u2011driven boost would be a one\u2011time price shock they could largely ignore.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell called that view \"a reasonable base case\" in remarks last month at a Fed research conference in Wyoming.  The recent benchmark employment revision points to substantially fewer job gains at the start of 2025, a key moment when officials decided to pause what had been an expected series of rate cuts this year on concern that tariffs could rekindle inflation.  Excluding two months at the end of 2024 when hiring jumped in a bout of business exuberance following Trump\u2019s election, the revised data show job gains from April\u202f2024 through August\u202f2025 may have averaged just 40,000 a month, a virtual stall speed for the US economy.  The unemployment rate for Blacks jumped from 6\u202f% in February to 7.5\u202f% in August, while the rate for whites edged down to 3.7\u202f% from 3.8\u202f% in February.  \"Fed officials are willing to make a quarter\u2011percentage\u2011point cut,\" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for BNY Investments, \"but I think they frame it as a recalibration after concluding tariffs will have less of a price impact than feared and likely won\u2019t trigger persistent inflation.\"  Consumer spending has held up better than anticipated, while investment gains around artificial intelligence have boosted output.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 06:53 PM\nSource:[The Daily Star](https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/feds-fear-meter-may-be-pointing-stagnation-rather-stagflation-3986026)\n\n**Global 36-hour interest-rate spree heralds first US reduction of 2025**\nThe article reports that a week of global central\u2011bank meetings will see the first U.S. interest\u2011rate cut since the 2024 election, with the Federal Reserve expected to lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.  The standoff between President Trump\u2019s push for lower borrowing costs and Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s concern over tariff\u2011driven inflation frames the discussion.  The Bank of Canada will cut its overnight rate to 2.5% on Wednesday, while the Bank of England is likely to keep its key rate unchanged after a split decision in August.  The Bank of Japan is expected to hold rates, continuing its tightening path.  The article lists a series of other advanced\u2011economy decisions, including potential cuts in Canada, Norway, and Indonesia, and notes that the U.S. and Canadian markets will watch retail\u2011sales data (forecast 0.3% rise in August) and jobless\u2011claims figures.  A Bloomberg economists\u2019 quote says, 'We expect the FOMC to cut rates by 25 basis points. That won't be because economic data on both sides of Fed's mandate - price stability and full employment - warrant it.

The Fed\u2019s next meeting on Sept.\u202f17 is expected to see a 25\u2011basis\u2011point cut, but officials warn that the move may not start a smooth rate\u2011cutting cycle. Pat Harker, former president of the Philadelphia Fed, said 'it's not obvious that's going to happen here in a robust way.' The Fed\u2019s policy rate is currently 4.25\u202f%\u20134.5\u202f%. Trump last month tried to fire Governor Lisa Cook and nominated a close ally for the Board of Governors, a move temporarily blocked by the courts. Jobs data have been disappointing, with a rise in unemployment\u2011benefit filings and revised employment growth figures for 2024 and early 2025. Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments, said 'I see weakness in the employment data that they've got to respond to' and expects a cut but no continuous reductions. Tariff\u2011related price pressures are beginning to show up, but many firms are absorbing duties. Marc Giannoni of Barclays Capital noted 'The trade shock and the immigration shock are two shocks that are making it very difficult for them to manage their dual\u2011mandate goals.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 02:30 PM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fed-debate-turns-to-pace-of-cuts-amid-heavy-trump-pressure-13545223.html)\n\n**US consumer inflation heats up but unlikely to deter rate cut**\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose to 2.9\u202fpercent year\u2011on\u2011year in August, the highest level since January, according to Labor Department data.  The month\u2011on\u2011month increase was 0.4\u202fpercent, up from 0.2\u202fpercent in July.  Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, climbed 3.1\u202fpercent from a year ago.  \"We are seeing some impact from tariffs, especially with higher prices on cars and clothes,\" said LPL Financial chief economist Jeffrey Roach, adding that grocery costs had their biggest jump since 2022.  President Donald Trump\u2019s 10\u202fpercent tariffs on most trading partners and sector\u2011specific duties on steel and autos are cited as contributing to the price rise.  Despite the hotter inflation, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates at its September 16\u201117 meeting, with traders anticipating a 25\u2011basis\u2011point reduction.  \"The jump in initial jobless claims to its highest reading since October 2021 overshadows the importance of the inflation report,\" said Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic, noting that the labor market\u2019s cooling reinforces the case for a rate cut.  IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack warned that \"some strains are beginning to show\" in the U.S. economy, with demand cooling and job growth slowing, suggesting the Fed may keep rates lower in October if expectations remain contained.  Navy Federal Credit Union chief economist Heather Long highlighted the tariff\u2011driven cost increases, noting coffee up 21\u202fpercent, audio equipment up 12\u202fpercent, and living\u2011room furniture up 10\u202fpercent from last August.\n\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 07:31 AM\nSource:[The Daily Star](https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/us-consumer-inflation-heats-unlikely-deter-rate-cut-3984696)\n\n**Unemployment, inflation and GDP growth will be worse this year than...**\nAccording to a new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report released on September 12, 2025, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, immigration crackdowns and sweeping tax and spending law are expected to worsen unemployment, inflation and GDP growth this year before improving next year. The CBO now projects real GDP growth to fall from 2.5\u202f% in 2024 to 1.4\u202f% in 2025, a downgrade from the 1.9\u202f% originally projected. It also projects GDP to rise to 2.2\u202f% in 2026, then level at 1.8\u202f% in 2027 and 2028.

The report attributes the slowdown to higher consumer prices from tariffs and a decline in immigration, which reduces consumer spending. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, 'Americans heard similar doom\u2011and\u2011gloom forecasts during President Trump\u00b4s first term, when the President\u00b4s economic agenda unleashed historic job, wage, and economic growth and the first decline in wealth inequality in decades.' He added, 'These same policies of tax cuts, tariffs, deregulation, and energy abundance are set to deliver - and prove the forecasters wrong - again in President Trump\u00b4s second term.' The CBO also estimates that Trump\u2019s hard\u2011line immigration measures will remove roughly 320,000 people from the U.S. over the next decade, and that the U.S. population will be 4.5\u202fmillion lower by 2035 than previously projected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 08:23 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-15093577/Unemployment-inflation-GDP-growth-worse-year-projected-budget-office-says.html)\n\n**Fed's fear meter may be pointing to stagnation, rather than**\nFederal Reserve officials, who are expected to cut interest rates next week, are also moving closer to resolving a months\u2011long debate over the risk of stagflation after recent data showed persistent weakness in hiring and easing inflation concerns.  The shift began this summer when two Fed governors dissented in July, arguing that the job market warranted a rate cut, and continued as other officials downplayed inflation and focused on an economy that was slowing and at risk of shedding jobs.  The latest data show the unemployment rate rose to 4.3\u202f% in August and the economy actually lost jobs in June following a revision.  A benchmark employment revision this week indicated nearly a million fewer jobs were added in the year through March than originally reported.  Consumer prices in August rose faster than the prior month, while initial jobless\u2011benefits claims jumped in the latest week, signalling a cooling labor market.  \"The Fed should cut 50 basis points next week\u2026Labor market conditions are cooling more rapidly than they were to start the year,\" wrote Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.

Inflation rose 0.4% in August and 2.9% on a yearly basis, according to a federal report, which is still below the 2% target but higher than the 0.3% estimate.  Jobless claims surged to 263,000 in the week ended September 6, the highest in nearly four years.  Economists say these conditions make a rate cut almost inevitable; the CME FedWatch model assigned a 93% probability to a 25\u2011basis\u2011point cut at the next meeting.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 0.3% monthly gain and a 12\u2011month increase of 3.1%, with core inflation at 3.1% as well.  Coffee, beef, and shelter prices were the main contributors to the rise, while medical care, recreation, and communication fell.  Stocks rallied after the CPI release, reflecting expectations of a Fed cut.  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Fed should have acted sooner and praised President Trump\u2019s economic agenda, calling it a \u201cboom.\u201d  Trump\u2019s tariff policy\u201410% on all imports and 15\u201341% on over 67 countries\u2014has raised concerns that businesses may pass costs onto consumers.  Chief economist Heather Long noted the 2.9% August inflation as the highest since January.  Representative Brendan Boyle criticized Trump as a \u201ccon artist.\u201d  Economists like Wayne Winegarden warned that a cut could trigger a resurgence of inflation, while others, such as Kishore Kulkarni, argue that a cut would help the housing market.  The U.S. added only 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July, and the BLS revised the 12\u2011month job\u2011creation total down by 911,000 for the year ending March.

The data suggest that the jobs market had been deteriorating for months before the Trump tariff policy and that stimulus measures such as the 'Inflation Reduction Act' and the 'Chips Act' did not prevent the decline. The revision also implies that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates later this month, a move that could be bullish for stocks. In contrast, Wednesday\u2019s producer price index (PPI) came in cooler than expected: the PPI fell 0.1% for the month versus a 0.3% increase forecast by Wall Street, and core PPI rose 2.8% year\u2011over\u2011year versus the 3.5% estimate.

The month\u2011on\u2011month drop in wholesale prices could signal lower profit margins and a potential easing of inflationary pressure. Fed chief Jerome Powell has suggested that the central bank could cut interest rates at its next meeting on September\u202f17, citing the Fed\u2019s \u2018dual mandate\u2019 to balance a healthy labor market while keeping inflation near a 2\u202fpercent target. The wholesale price report was released a day before the Labor Department\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) is due; the CPI is expected to rise 0.3\u202fpercent from July, up from 0.2\u202fpercent the month before. Economists watch wholesale prices because components such as health care and financial services feed into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. Meanwhile, new data released yesterday showed that the US jobs market is in a much worse shape than initially thought: the number of jobs added to the economy for the year through March could be 911,000 less than previously reported, implying nearly 76,000 fewer jobs each month. The latest report also painted a gloomy picture, with just 22,000 jobs added in August, far below Wall Street\u2019s forecast of 75,000, and June\u2019s figures were revised down to a net loss of 13,000 jobs. Leading figures now believe America is in a \u2018labor recession\u2019 that risks pushing the rest of the economy into a full\u2011blown recession. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said a \u2018labor recession\u2019 is already underway and that further revisions risk tipping the economy over a cliff; he added that an uptick in layoffs\u2014already up 140\u202fpercent from a year ago\u2014would also darken the situation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 01:17 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/consumer/article-15084629/Key-inflation-gauge-sparks-hope-tariffs-wont-sting-much.html)\n\n**Even If Rates Go Down, We're Not Out of the Woods Yet**\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has hinted at a potential rate cut in September, according to the article. The piece explains that lower interest rates are traditionally seen as stimulators of economic growth, consumer spending, investment, and tax revenue, citing the positive reaction of the stock market to cheaper money. It notes that the Fed cuts rates when data suggest a weakening economy, but that lower rates can also trigger higher inflation, especially with President Trump's tariff policy. The article presents recent data: GDP fell 0.5% in Q1\u202f2025, with consumer spending and investment weak, and imports the main contributor to growth; if imports are excluded, GDP would likely be negative for Q2, implying a recession. It also cites PCE figures, noting that PCE (minus food and energy) is rising, but the Fed may not view this as a reason to lower rates. Unemployment data are described as steady, but the JOLTS report shows unemployment outpacing job openings for the first time since the pandemic. The article references historical Fed rate cuts, noting that every cut over the past quarter century has preceded a recession, but that 1995, 1998, and 2021 were exceptions with stock gains of +34%, +26%, and +31% respectively. It advises clients to focus on data\u2011driven investment strategies, quoting: 'Instead of trying to front run the data, be the data.' The article also discusses the VIX as a tool for assessing market sentiment, warning that a low VIX does not eliminate risk. The tone is analytical, presenting data and interpretations without overt emotional language.

Trump has blamed the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, urging patience, and on social media he said, \u2018The Fed should have cut rates long ago; it\u2019s too late.\u2019  Trump also claimed that rates should be lowered by 3\u202fpercentage points, a view that few economists support.  Inflation has fallen from 2.9\u202f% to 2.7\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year, yet the personal\u2011consumer\u2011price index rose to 2.9\u202f%, above the Fed\u2019s 2\u202f% target.  Market expectations now favor a Fed rate cut of 0.25\u202f% on September\u202f16\u201117, with a 90\u202f% probability of a 0.25\u202f% cut and a 10\u202f% probability of a 0.5\u202f% cut.  Trump\u2019s rhetoric about a \u201cgolden age\u201d of manufacturing and the \u201cGreat and Beautiful Act\u201d is contrasted with the reality of a sluggish housing market, where unsold inventory has risen nearly 50\u202f% since the last Fed cut.  The article quotes Trump\u2019s claim that the economy will shine again in \u201csix months,\u201d and Treasury Secretary Janet\u202fBiden\u2011era adviser Kevin\u202fHassett\u2019s view that the U.S. must undergo a \u201cdetox\u201d period.  Overall, the piece presents a mix of data, expert commentary, and political statements to argue that the U.S. is heading toward recession.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6813/8988282)\n\n**Goolsbee Leaves Door Open for Potential Interest Rate Cut in September**\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee left the door open for a potential interest rate cut in September, but expressed caution due to recent inflation data. Goolsbee told CNBC that 'we still need at least one more meeting to evaluate if we're on the right track.' He added, 'If we can get reassured, or get a signal during this meeting or fall meetings, that we're not in a sustained inflationary spiral; it will still be reasonable, given the strength of the economy, to bring interest rates back to a level we think is stable.' The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged throughout the year, monitoring the impact of Trump-era tariffs, which were expected to lead to higher inflation, unemployment, and slower economic growth. However, data has not yet confirmed these concerns. As the economy slows down, economists and financial markets expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates again next month. Meanwhile, some concerning indicators have emerged around inflation, along with mixed signals about the persistence of consumer spending. Friday's data showed a 0.5% increase in US retail sales last month, driven by a 0.9% increase in service prices, after adjusting for the tariff hike in July, which kept prices higher than usual for consumers. Goolsbee commented on the producer price index and consumer price index reports, saying, 'This does raise my concern a bit; it's unlikely to be due to tariffs, so I hope it's just a temporary blip.' He added, 'We shouldn't overreact to one month's import price data, nor should we overinterpret the monthly inflation data for the consumer price index or the producer price index, but it's at least worth watching and paying attention to.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 12:40 PM\nSource:[aawsat.com](https://aawsat.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF/5175588-%D8%BA%D9%88%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%AE%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B6%D8%AE%D9%85)\n\n**Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Expresses Concern Over Inflation Data**\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Estaban Goolsbee expressed concern about inflation data and its impact on interest rates. He stated, 'I am still looking for more convincing data before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 16-17.' Goolsbee, one of the 12 voters on the Federal Open Market Committee this year, added that the reports on consumer and producer prices 'raised concerns' about the direction of inflation, as service prices 'that are clearly not temporary' are rising. He said during an interview with 'Squawk Box': 'I feel we still need another report, at least, to know if we are still on the right track.' The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July was relatively in line with market expectations, despite the core reading, excluding food and energy, rising to 3.1%, slightly above Wall Street's expectations. However, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for July, which measures wholesale prices, surprised with a 0.9% monthly increase, the largest in about three years. The data is closely scrutinized for evidence of the impact of tariffs on inflation. While neither report showed clear and significant effects, many economists believe that the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on imports are starting to show up in the data and will become more apparent in the coming months. Goolsbee said, 'It all depends on the data and economic expectations. If the inflation reports continue as before... I will be very confident, after things have cooled down, we are still in our current position, a strong economy with low inflation.' In this case... it would be correct to lower interest rates to the level we believe they will stabilize at. We need to clarify some things through the numbers.' The markets are approaching certainty that the Federal Open Market Committee will vote to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point in September, from its current level of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, there are some doubts about what will happen next, with a 55% probability of another cut in October and a 43% probability of a third step in December, according to the FedWatch index from the CME Group.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[elbalad.news](https://www.elbalad.news/6667712)\n\n**US Treasury Secretary: Reducing Interest Rates Almost Certain After Inflation Data**\nUS Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, said on Wednesday, August 13, that reducing interest rates at the Federal Reserve's meeting in September is almost certain after new data showed moderate inflation rates in the US last month. Yellen believes that a 50-basis-point cut is possible in one go, given the recent weak labor market data. According to FedWatch, a tool from the CME Group, market participants see a 99.9% chance of a 0.25 percentage point cut in the federal funds rate during the next meeting on September 16-17. These developments come after the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July, which showed a lower-than-expected increase, indicating that inflation rates have not been significantly affected by the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The data showed that the CPI rose 0.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis and 2.7% on an annual basis, compared to expectations of 0.2% and 2.8% respectively. Yellen later commented that the Federal Reserve used concerns about a weak labor market as a reason to cut interest rates more in September 2024. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times last year, totaling 1%, starting from the September 2024 meeting. Trump criticized the rate cut last year, calling it politically motivated ahead of the presidential election in November 2024. On the other hand, Trump has repeatedly called for rate cuts this year, while the Federal Reserve has maintained them during its five meetings in 2025 so far.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 14, 2025 12:33 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6665917)\n\n**JP Morgan CEO Criticizes Trump's Attempts to Influence the Federal Reserve**\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, has criticized Donald Trump's attempts to influence the Federal Reserve, saying 'the independence of the Fed is absolutely crucial' and 'playing with the Fed can have negative consequences.' This is the first time a major US financial institution leader has publicly criticized Trump's attacks on Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman. Dimon has a reputation for speaking his mind, and his comments have been seen as a rare rebuke of Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed. Trump has been threatening to replace Powell, who has a term that ends in May 2025, and has called him 'a fool' and 'a clown' for not cutting interest rates. However, market analysts believe that Trump is unlikely to actually fire Powell, as it would lead to a surge in US Treasury yields and a decline in the value of the dollar. The Trump administration's trade policies, including tariffs, have actually made it more difficult to achieve the lower interest rates they desire. The tariffs have led to 'tariff inflation,' which is causing prices to rise. The US Labor Department reported that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% in June, the largest monthly increase of the year. Many companies have been stockpiling goods before tariffs were imposed, and now they are passing on the costs to consumers. Goldman Sachs estimates that US consumers will bear 70% of the cost of the tariffs. 'The debate over whether tariffs cause inflation is over,' said Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 'Prices are rising,' said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. However, some analysts believe that the purchasing power of US consumers is declining, which could lead to a decrease in inflation. The CPI report showed that hotel prices and airline fares are declining, and rental prices are also falling. 'Demand is clearly weakening,' said Richard Moody, chief economist at R Legg Mason Financial.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 08:39 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/america/1208319.html)\n\n**Trump's Tariffs Start to Take Effect, Inflation Rises**\nThe recent 2.7% increase in the US inflation rate, according to the latest data for June, may be the first sign of a trend upward that would show the initial effect of President Donald Trump's tariff war. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by three tenths from the 2.4% recorded in May, in line with analysts' forecasts, who estimate that these data will continue to rise in the coming months when business owners can no longer avoid passing on import costs to consumers. According to Omair Sharif, of the consulting firm Inflation Insights, the prices of basic goods, excluding cars, experienced a monthly increase of 0.55%, the highest since November 2021, which is a sign that 'tariffs are starting to take effect.' However, the most palpable effects of this tariff war are yet to be seen, as it usually takes months for these effects to be reflected in the data. The June figures would strengthen the cautious stance taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) on a future reduction in interest rates, which remain in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since the December 2024 cut. Trump has insisted that the Fed should lower rates by at least three points, considering the inflation 'very low'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 04:18 AM\nSource:[Gesti\u00f3n](https://gestion.pe/mundo/eeuu/aranceles-de-trump-comienzan-a-hacer-mella-en-la-inflacion-de-eeuu-cuanto-subio-noticia/)\n\n**Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Testifies Before Congress**\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Federal Reserve will continue to wait for economic developments before making a decision on interest rates. This stance is in contrast to President Donald Trump's calls for an immediate rate cut. Powell stated, 'At this time, we are in a good position that allows us to wait and see more about the potential path of the economy before considering any changes to our policy.' Powell is set to face two days of intense questioning from Congress, despite Trump's repeated calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell, saying, 'I hope the Congress will end this guy's stupid and nasty behavior. We will pay the price for his incompetence for years to come.' He added, 'A rate cut will make a big difference, and we can raise it later if things get worse.' In his testimony, Powell reviewed the current economic situation, stating that the data indicates that the economy remains strong. He noted that the GDP growth rate slowed to 2.5% in the first quarter of 2025, but this was largely due to fluctuations in net exports, driven by companies' increased imports in anticipation of potential tariffs. On the other hand, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which excludes net exports, investment, and government spending, grew at a strong 2.5% rate. Powell also noted that consumer sentiment surveys and business surveys have shown a decline in confidence in recent months, and an increase in uncertainty about economic expectations, largely due to trade policy concerns. He emphasized that 'we will see how these developments affect future spending and investment.' In the labor market, Powell stated that conditions remain strong. The average monthly gain in non-farm payroll jobs was 124,000 in the first five months of the year, and the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.2% in May, remained within a narrow range throughout the past year. He also noted that wage growth has continued to be moderate, with growth exceeding inflation. Powell stated, 'Overall, a wide range of indicators suggest that labor market conditions are roughly balanced and consistent with the maximum level of employment.' He added, 'The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressure.' He also noted that the labor market's strength in recent years has helped to narrow long-standing gaps in employment and earnings across demographic groups. Regarding inflation, Powell stated that it has 'declined significantly' from its peak in mid-2022, but remains 'a bit above' the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2%. The PCE price index, which is based on consumer spending, rose 2.3% over the past 12 months, with the exception of food and energy prices, which are volatile. Powell also noted that short-term inflation expectations have risen in recent months, and are attributed to tariffs as a primary factor. However, most long-term inflation expectations remain consistent with the 2% target. In terms of monetary policy, Powell stated that the Federal Reserve's actions are guided by its dual mandate. With the labor market approaching full employment and inflation remaining above target, the committee has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25% to 4.5% since the beginning of the year. He also noted that the Federal Reserve has continued to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, considering the uncertain effects of tariffs on the economy. Powell emphasized that the effects of tariffs on inflation can be short-lived, reflecting a one-time change in price levels. However, he also acknowledged that the effects can be more persistent. He concluded his testimony by stating, 'At this time, we are in a good position to wait and see more about the potential path of the economy before considering any changes to our policy.' He reiterated the Federal Reserve's commitment to its public mission, stating, 'Everything we do is in service of our public mission... We will do everything in our power to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5157839)\n\n**Powell Rejects Calls for Rate Cut as Early as July, Citing Strong Economy**\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has rejected calls to lower interest rates as early as July. The US economy remains strong, but the consequences of President Donald Trump's trade war and other policy changes have introduced uncertainty, according to Powell's semi-annual report. The impact of import tariffs is expected to be less dramatic than forecast in April, but 'their increase this year is likely to push prices up and affect economic activity,' Powell said. Although the inflationary impact of Trump's policy 'may be short-term,' 'it is also possible that inflationary effects may be more persistent,' the report states. 'Despite increased uncertainty, the economy is in a strong position. The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has significantly decreased, but is slightly above our long-term target of 2%,' Powell said. The US GDP growth rate rose to 2.5% in 2024, but decreased in the first quarter, reflecting fluctuations in net exports caused by companies increasing import volumes before the introduction of new tariffs. 'This unusual spike complicated the measurement of GDP,' Powell noted. 'Household and business surveys report a deterioration in sentiment over the past few months and increased uncertainty about economic prospects, largely reflecting concerns about trade policy. It remains to be seen how these events will affect future spending and investment,' the report states.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 01:22 PM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/business/1032925)\n\n**Trump Calls on Federal Reserve to Lower Interest Rates by Full Percentage Point**\nUS President Donald Trump has called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates by a full percentage point, following the release of new inflation data. Trump described the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) as 'great', and wrote on his Truth Social account that 'the Federal Reserve should lower a full point. It will pay much less interest on debt. Very important!' According to Reuters. Trump's Vice President, JD Vance, also criticized the Federal Reserve for refusing to lower interest rates. Trump has been calling for lower interest rates for some time, and his comments have been largely ignored by the Federal Reserve. The CPI for May showed a slight increase in inflation compared to last year, with many economists expecting a surge in prices due to the significant tariffs imposed by Trump on a wide range of goods. The overall CPI for the month rose 2.4% compared to May 2024, slightly higher than the 2.3% reading in April, while the core CPI, excluding food and energy prices, rose 2.8% during the same period. The CPI data comes before the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, where officials are expected to keep the target federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. The Federal Reserve officials are currently in a wait-and-see mode, as the uncertainty of Trump's trade policy makes it difficult to predict the future of the economy. Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, believe that tariffs will increase inflation, reduce growth, and lower employment. Some of these risks have been mitigated by Trump's recent easing of some of the more severe tariffs. The main question facing the Federal Reserve is whether the tariffs will lead to a one-time increase in prices that can be ignored, or a more sustained increase. A recent report from the New York Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing and service companies will face a large amount of tariffs. However, a separate report from the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed that the public has become less concerned about future inflation, which may reduce the risk of sustained price pressures. Following the release of the CPI data, markets increased the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September. Economists at City Bank said that the CPI data 'will give the Federal Reserve more confidence that the underlying inflation has fallen faster this year than the rising risks from tariffs, and that the risk of sustained inflation from tariffs is low.' They added 'we continue to expect consecutive rate cuts of 125 basis points from the Federal Reserve starting in September.' However, other economists were more cautious about long-term inflation expectations. Scanda Amarnath, CEO of Empleo America, said 'it is likely that we will see a noticeable surge in inflation of goods and electricity later this summer, both of which threaten to keep interest rates high for longer and increase the risk of recession as a result.' Trump's call for a full percentage point cut in interest rates is a rare political call that is usually reserved for economic emergencies. Trump has been pushing for easier monetary policy for some time, even as Federal Reserve officials have ignored his comments. Trump's comment on how a Federal Reserve rate cut would affect government debt payments highlights the high cost of short-term interest rates on government borrowing. However, the Federal Reserve is not responsible for managing government borrowing costs, and officials have said that is not a factor in their deliberations on future interest rate policy.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 06:25 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5153453)\n\n**US prices grow at a slow pace, Trump urges the Fed to lower interest rates**\nUS prices are growing at a slow pace. Trump is urging the Fed to lower interest rates. Many American businesses have warned that they would be forced to raise prices to consumers due to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. However, recent data suggests that the impact on consumers has been contained, contributing to keeping the price of money under control, an element that could lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as early as September. According to the Consumer Price Index published on Wednesday, in May the annual inflation rate reached 2.4%, a slight increase from the 2.3% recorded in April. The 'core' inflation rate, which excludes categories more subject to fluctuations such as food and energy, remained stable at 2.8%, a key indicator that policymakers closely monitor to assess the real pressure on prices. However, it is not a victory signal: economists expect that the tariffs, if they are reinstated and are as high as those announced on April 2, could have their first effects on prices in the summer: tariffs are a tax on imports and often, at least initially, companies manage to absorb them. The data collected by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book show that costs will increase at a higher rate 'in the next three months'. Another reason for this delay is the stockpiling: companies, after months of threats from Donald Trump, have stockpiled products to avoid importing goods hit by tariffs. Meanwhile, the results published yesterday send an important signal to the Fed, which for months has refused to lower interest rates, despite Trump's persistent requests, fearing that inflation could return to grow: but the bank led by Jerome Powell wants to understand better how Trump's policies can influence the US economy. The minutes of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the monetary arm of the central bank, outline a less positive situation: with an increase in inflation in the coming months and in 2026, and a return to the 2% target by 2027. Trump has written a post on his social media Truth, again asking for a cut in interest rates. 'Just out the inflation data. Fantastic numbers. The Fed should cut rates by one point at a time. We would pay much less interest on future debt repayments. It's very important!', he wrote. However, the Fed prefers to wait until the summer and make a new cut probably in September, and then add a second one by the end of 2025, if the situation remains stable. Wall Street, after responding positively to the inflation data and the agreement with China, has continued the session of yesterday mixed, waiting for new trade agreements that can exclude a tariff war. Yesterday, US Treasury yields fell, a clear signal that investors see inflation as a smaller obstacle to cutting interest rates. US Treasury yields at 10 years, one of the main indicators for the costs of mortgages, car loans and credit card interest rates, fell below 4.4%.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 03:16 AM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/i_prezzi_usa_crescono_poco_trump_fed_giu_tassi-8892318.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "The panel of forecasting experts is divided on whether the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) in November 2025 will be lower than in November 2024 (2.73%), but most expect only a modest difference with significant uncertainty. Forecasters taking a monetary policy, economic statistical, and policy analysis approach (e.g., Central Banking, US Economic Statistics, US Policy Analysis, New Keynesian Models) generally emphasize the recent rise in inflation due to tariffs and restrictive immigration, resulting in current CPI (as of August 2025) above 2.7%. These experts cite mainstream projections (CBO, Moody\u2019s) that anticipate annual inflation above 3% in 2025, and stress that tariff pass-through to consumer prices and labor supply reductions are likely to persist through late 2025, making it more probable inflation remains at or above the prior year\u2019s rate. Their combined probabilities for a 'Yes' outcome (lower CPI in Nov 2025) cluster mainly below 50%, with estimates like 32\u201340% (Central Banking baseline, US Economic Stats, Policy Analysis, Political Business Cycles) and some higher outliers.\n\nConversely, forecasters drawing more on forward guidance, labor market analysis, macroeconomic base rates, and the one-off nature of recent shocks (e.g., Central Banking\u2014Fed Forward Guidance, Monetarist, Phillips Curve, Interest Rate Transmission, Inflation Expectations views) highlight the rapidly deteriorating labor market\u2014rising unemployment, weak job creation, downward BLS revisions\u2014coupled with evidence that much of the tariff impact may be a one-time price level bump, rather than sustained inflation. They argue that labor market slack, declining aggregate demand, softening PPI, and expectations anchoring are all classic precursors to disinflation. These forecasters see base effects from elevated 2024 CPI and modest monthly price declines as potentially pulling YoY inflation below the 2024 mark, even with lingering stickiness in services and shelter. Their estimated probabilities tend to be clearly above 50%, ranging from 66% to 73%, reflecting their conviction that disinflationary forces\u2014especially lagged effects from the cooling labor market and possible impact of Fed rate cuts\u2014outweigh remaining inflation risks.\n\nAll experts emphasize high uncertainty, stemming from the interplay between persistent cost-push shocks (tariffs, restricted immigration), weakening demand, and political intervention in monetary policy. Key divergences arise from their weighting of how persistent tariff-driven inflation will prove, how quickly demand will deteriorate, and how effective rate cuts will be in either offsetting or compounding these dynamics. The debate also features varying interpretations of base rates for YoY CPI reversals following shock events. Overall, the consensus reflects a near-even split, with a slight lean towards inflation either remaining narrowly above or just below the 2024 level, depending on the relative strength of labor market-driven disinflation versus persistent supply-side pressures. Expected probability-weighted outcome, based on this synthesis, would be close to 50%, but individual forecasts span from 32% (more pessimistic on disinflation) to 75% (more optimistic on demand-led moderation of inflation).",
