Still, ARES stands out as a strong technical and thematic candidate: it meets all financial, liquidity, and float requirements and would add sectoral diversity to the index. Importantly, none of the recent rejections (like MSTR) signal a broad committee hesitancy about asset managers or alternative investment firms\u2014only business model risks specific to crypto. While ARES remains a top contender on 'watch' lists, the window for a near-term inclusion is narrowing.

In defense, therefore, I acknowledge your strong base-rate logic, but emphasize that the structural readiness and accounting cleanliness of ARES places it at the very top of the 'next in line' cohort, and my elevated estimate reflects this conditional posture\u2014albeit with less weight on status-quo inertia than your model would advise."

Your stress on there being 'no explicit negative news' but also no catalyst, and your modest probability, are both empirically justified. From my strategic management perspective, I'd suggest adding that ARES's maturity and diversity do set it apart for future candidacy, but your current window framing is exactly right\u2014short-term odds are limited mostly to the chance of a last-minute constituent exit. This matches real-world index management and organizational behavior: institutional inertia dominates until there is a concrete need.

You correctly identify that, even for companies like ARES meeting every technical and financial benchmark, post-rebalance additions typically depend almost exclusively on rare exogenous events such as sudden mergers, bankruptcies, or unexpected sectoral imbalances. From a strategic management (RBV) perspective, I\u2019d add that ARES's strong, sustainable business model may allow it to integrate swiftly in the event of such an opening\u2014but your highlighting of the 'stickiness' of the index is well-supported by the historical record. Your single-digit forecast is justified: while readiness and legitimacy are necessary, the actual timing remains overwhelmingly a function of status-quo adherence unless triggered otherwise. Thus, your conservative odds are the most prudent estimate given the facts on hand and observed committee behavior."

The strong consensus from index, equity research, and strategy experts\u2014each citing low single-digit (or just into teens) probabilities for post-rebalance inclusion\u2014demonstrates that I overweighted ARES's readiness and underweighted the practical inertia and discretion of the S&P committee.

The decision is a setback not only for Strategy but for the broader cohort of corporate crypto treasuries that use balance\u2011sheet bitcoin accumulation. The report points out that Strategy\u2019s inclusion in other major benchmarks\u2014such as the Nasdaq\u202f100 and MSCI indices\u2014has quietly given bitcoin a backdoor into retail and institutional portfolios. JPMorgan warns that the S&P\u202f500 decision could mark the limit of that trend and may prompt other index providers to rethink the inclusion of bitcoin\u2011heavy companies. Adding to the pressure, Nasdaq has reportedly begun requiring shareholder approval before companies can issue new stock to buy crypto. Strategy recently abandoned its no\u2011dilution pledge, indicating a willingness to issue shares at lower multiples to continue funding bitcoin purchases. Corporate crypto treasuries are facing weakening share prices and slowing issuance; equity and debt fundraising volumes declined last quarter, suggesting investor appetite is waning. The rising risk premium could push investors and index providers to favor crypto companies with operating businesses\u2014such as exchanges and miners\u2014over pure bitcoin\u2011holding vehicles. The report cites bitcoin\u2019s price at $108,783.53 and notes that the S&P\u202f500 decision could \"mark the limit of that trend\" and that \"the rising risk premium could push investors and index providers to favor crypto companies with operating businesses, like exchanges and miners, over pure bitcoin\u2011holding vehicles.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 11:58 AM\nSource:[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/11/strategy-s-s-and-p-500-snub-is-a-cautionary-signal-for-corporate-bitcoin-treasuries-jpmorgan)\n\n**S&P 500 Rejects Strategy Despite Meeting Eligibility Criteria, JPMorgan Reports**\nThe S&P\u202f500 index committee rejected Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) from the index last week, even though the company met all technical eligibility criteria. JPMorgan analysts, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, described the move as a \"blow to crypto treasuries\" and warned that it signals caution toward firms that function primarily as bitcoin funds. The decision affects not only Strategy but also other crypto\u2011treasury companies that have emerged recently. Strategy, the largest public crypto\u2011treasury firm, had previously been included in major benchmarks such as the Nasdaq\u202f100, MSCI\u202fUSA, MSCI\u202fWorld and the Russell\u202f2000, which had helped drive its stock performance. The rejection suggests that the indirect channel for bitcoin exposure through index inclusion may be \"reaching its limits,\" according to the JPMorgan report. The article notes that other index providers might reconsider adding similar firms after the S&P\u202f500\u2019s lead, potentially restricting their access to broader investment portfolios. Additional pressures include Nasdaq\u2019s new requirement for shareholder approval before issuing shares to fund crypto purchases, and a recent shift by Strategy away from a pledge to avoid issuing shares below a 2.5\u2011multiple. Market fatigue is evident in declining equity issuance volumes and slowing funding activity for crypto\u2011treasury firms, while debt issuance continues with higher risk premiums. JPMorgan analysts warn that skepticism toward bitcoin\u2011backed loans, token\u2011linked convertibles and other structured financing is growing, and that capital may shift toward crypto companies with operating businesses such as exchanges and miners. The S&P\u202f500 rejection reflects broader market concerns about companies whose primary business model revolves around holding cryptocurrency rather than traditional operations, and could reshape how crypto\u2011focused companies structure their balance sheets moving forward.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/sp-500-rejects-strategy-despite-meeting-eligibility-criteria-jpmorgan-reports/)\n\n**Part of the Club: Robinhood & AppLovin Soar on S&P 500 Inclusion**\nThe article reports that on September\u202f8, 2025, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:\u202fHOOD) and AppLovin (NASDAQ:\u202fAPP) were added to the S&P\u202f500 Index, a move that validates their business fundamentals and is expected to drive further share demand.  At the time of inclusion, Robinhood had a market capitalization of $33\u202fbillion and AppLovin $109\u202fbillion; about 25\u202f% of S&P\u202f500 constituents began 2025 with lower market caps, making the addition seem inevitable.  Shares reacted strongly: Robinhood closed up nearly 16\u202f% and AppLovin rose almost 12\u202f%.  Prior to the price action, both stocks had surged 496\u202f% and 520\u202f% over the previous 52\u202fweeks, respectively, but the article notes that such gains are not solely speculative.  S&P requires a positive GAAP net income over the last 12\u202fmonths; Robinhood has maintained positive GAAP net income for seven consecutive quarters, while AppLovin has done so for nine quarters, underscoring their profitability.  In contrast, Bitcoin\u2011buyer Strategy (NASDAQ:\u202fMSTR) \u2013 which also meets the market\u2011cap threshold of $22.7\u202fbillion \u2013 has shown positive GAAP net income only two of eight quarters, making it a less likely candidate for inclusion.  The article explains that passive funds such as BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core S&P\u202f500 ETF (NYSEARCA:\u202fIVV), which holds roughly $667\u202fbillion in net assets, will need to purchase the new constituents to track the index, creating additional buying pressure.  Active managers may also adjust their holdings toward the new index weights, further supporting demand.  Overall, the article presents the inclusion as a credibility boost for the companies, while noting that long\u2011term success will still depend on continued earnings growth and business expansion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 06:31 PM\nSource:[Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/part-of-the-club-robinhood-and-applovin-soar-on-s-and-p-500-inclusion/)\n\n**Strategy's (MSTR) S&P 500 Snub Signals Chill for Corporate Bitcoin (BTC) Treasuries: JPMorgan**\nJPMorgan\u2019s analyst report notes that Strategy\u2019s (MSTR) bid to join the S&P\u202f500 was rejected even though it met all technical eligibility criteria, a move the bank says signals growing caution toward companies that function as de\u2011facto bitcoin funds.

JPMorgan analysts, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, described the move as a \"blow to crypto treasuries\" and warned that it signals caution toward firms that function primarily as bitcoin funds. The decision affects not only Strategy but also other crypto\u2011treasury companies that have emerged recently. Strategy, the largest public crypto\u2011treasury firm, had previously been included in major benchmarks such as the Nasdaq\u202f100, MSCI\u202fUSA, MSCI\u202fWorld and the Russell\u202f2000, which had helped drive its stock performance. The rejection suggests that the indirect channel for bitcoin exposure through index inclusion may be \"reaching its limits,\" according to the JPMorgan report. The article notes that other index providers might reconsider adding similar firms after the S&P\u202f500\u2019s lead, potentially restricting their access to broader investment portfolios. Additional pressures include Nasdaq\u2019s new requirement for shareholder approval before issuing shares to fund crypto purchases, and a recent shift by Strategy away from a pledge to avoid issuing shares below a 2.5\u2011multiple. Market fatigue is evident in declining equity issuance volumes and slowing funding activity for crypto\u2011treasury firms, while debt issuance continues with higher risk premiums. JPMorgan analysts warn that skepticism toward bitcoin\u2011backed loans, token\u2011linked convertibles and other structured financing is growing, and that capital may shift toward crypto companies with operating businesses such as exchanges and miners. The S&P\u202f500 rejection reflects broader market concerns about companies whose primary business model revolves around holding cryptocurrency rather than traditional operations, and could reshape how crypto\u2011focused companies structure their balance sheets moving forward.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/sp-500-rejects-strategy-despite-meeting-eligibility-criteria-jpmorgan-reports/)\n\n**Part of the Club: Robinhood & AppLovin Soar on S&P 500 Inclusion**\nThe article reports that on September\u202f8, 2025, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:\u202fHOOD) and AppLovin (NASDAQ:\u202fAPP) were added to the S&P\u202f500 Index, a move that validates their business fundamentals and is expected to drive further share demand.  At the time of inclusion, Robinhood had a market capitalization of $33\u202fbillion and AppLovin $109\u202fbillion; about 25\u202f% of S&P\u202f500 constituents began 2025 with lower market caps, making the addition seem inevitable.  Shares reacted strongly: Robinhood closed up nearly 16\u202f% and AppLovin rose almost 12\u202f%.  Prior to the price action, both stocks had surged 496\u202f% and 520\u202f% over the previous 52\u202fweeks, respectively, but the article notes that such gains are not solely speculative.  S&P requires a positive GAAP net income over the last 12\u202fmonths; Robinhood has maintained positive GAAP net income for seven consecutive quarters, while AppLovin has done so for nine quarters, underscoring their profitability.  In contrast, Bitcoin\u2011buyer Strategy (NASDAQ:\u202fMSTR) \u2013 which also meets the market\u2011cap threshold of $22.7\u202fbillion \u2013 has shown positive GAAP net income only two of eight quarters, making it a less likely candidate for inclusion.  The article explains that passive funds such as BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core S&P\u202f500 ETF (NYSEARCA:\u202fIVV), which holds roughly $667\u202fbillion in net assets, will need to purchase the new constituents to track the index, creating additional buying pressure.  Active managers may also adjust their holdings toward the new index weights, further supporting demand.  Overall, the article presents the inclusion as a credibility boost for the companies, while noting that long\u2011term success will still depend on continued earnings growth and business expansion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 06:31 PM\nSource:[Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/part-of-the-club-robinhood-and-applovin-soar-on-s-and-p-500-inclusion/)\n\n**Strategy Misses S&P 500 Inclusion This Month: Will It Ever Make the Cut?**\nStrategy (MSTR), the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, was omitted from the S&P\u202f500 during the latest quarterly rebalancing, with AppLovin (APP), Robinhood (HOOD) and Emcor (EME) added instead. The company meets all eligibility criteria\u2014U.S. domicile, a market capitalization above $22.7\u202fbillion, profitability in the most recent quarter and year, and at least 50\u202f% of shares publicly available\u2014but the Index Committee also weighs sector weighting and other factors. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimates that $22\u202ftrillion is linked to S&P\u2011500\u2011based products, and Stephens analysis says fund managers would need to buy roughly 50\u202fmillion Strategy shares worth about $16\u202fbillion if the firm were added. After reporting a $10\u202fbillion profit in the last quarter, Strategy still fell short of inclusion. Former committee chair David Blitzer told Bloomberg that the committee\u2019s goal is \u2018to have an index that really is a great measure of the market.\u2019 He added, \u2018The market goes up, the index goes up.

The update adds AppLovin Corp. (APP), Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), and Emcor Group Inc.

The article cites that HOOD stock has gained over 434% in the past year and that being added to the S&P 500 automatically places the company into index funds, pensions, and retirement accounts worldwide, thereby expanding its institutional footprint. Other changes include Uber Technologies (UBER) joining the S&P 100, replacing Charter Communications (CHTR); MP Materials (MP) and Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS) moving into the S&P MidCap 400; and several firms\u2014Wendy\u2019s (WEN), MarketAxess, Caesars, Enphase, Acadia Healthcare (ACHC), and ManpowerGroup (MAN)\u2014transitioning to the S&P SmallCap 600.

Balchunas explained, 'Why wasn\u2019t $MSTR allowed into the S&P 500 Index despite meeting all the criteria? Because the Committee said no.'

If the company were accepted, passive index\u2011tracking funds would need to purchase roughly 50\u202fmillion shares, creating an estimated $16\u202fbillion inflow at current market prices.  The S&P\u202f500 committee evaluates liquidity, profitability, trading history, and sector balance; it requires a minimum market capitalization of $22.7\u202fbillion and positive income for the current and past four quarters.  Strategy\u2019s market cap exceeds $90\u202fbillion, comfortably above the threshold.  The technology sector dominates the index, and recent additions such as Coinbase Global and Block (founded by Jack\u202fDorsey) signal growing recognition of digital assets.  Melissa Roberts, managing director at Stephens, noted that \u2018If someone is a big player in the space, it\u2019s hard to ignore them.\u2019  Nonetheless, skepticism remains about the sustainability of Strategy\u2019s corporate\u2011treasury model, which raises capital through debt and equity to acquire Bitcoin.  Shares fell 17\u202f% in August, eroding the premium over Bitcoin holdings, and the 30\u2011day price volatility reached 96\u202f%, higher than that of Nvidia or Tesla, potentially raising red flags for the committee.  Although Strategy was included in the Nasdaq\u202f100 last December, the S&P\u202f500 is larger, with nearly $10\u202ftrillion tied to passive strategies.

The company\u2019s market cap of $90\u202fbillion, liquidity of nearly $70\u202fbillion in Bitcoin, and positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the past four quarters satisfy the index\u2019s requirements of U.S. domicile, a market cap of at least $22.7\u202fbillion, and profitability. Among 26 candidates, Strategy topped the float\u2011adjusted liquidity ratio, a key metric for inclusion. Melissa Roberts, head of index rebalancing research at Stephens, told Bloomberg, 'They care about building representation of leading companies in the 500. So, if someone is a big player in the space, it\u2019s hard to ignore them.' The S&P committee, however, retains discretion, citing concerns over sector balance and the company\u2019s 30\u2011day price volatility of 96\u202f%, higher than Nvidia\u2019s 77\u202f% and Tesla\u2019s 74\u202f%. A failed preferred\u2011stock sale earlier this year forced Strategy to issue common stock, causing the share price to fall 17\u202f% in August. Despite these risks, passive index funds would need to buy roughly 50\u202fmillion shares\u2014about $16\u202fbillion at current prices\u2014if the company is added, turning institutional investors into indirect Bitcoin holders overnight. Research by Antti Petajisto shows that new S&P 500 entrants typically rally on inclusion, an effect that has slowed but still exists. Edward Yoon of Macquarie Capital warned that meeting eligibility does not guarantee inclusion, noting that the committee\u2019s discretion and sector\u2011weighting rules remain decisive.

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether Ares Management Corporation (ARES) will be announced for inclusion in the S&P 500 before October 2025 are nearly unanimous in their assessment that, while ARES meets all technical eligibility and financial requirements (including market capitalization, liquidity, GAAP profitability, U.S. domicile, and appropriate corporate structure), the probability of an announcement prior to the deadline is low. The main point of consensus is that the September 2025 rebalance\u2014where the S&P 500 committee added Robinhood and AppLovin\u2014was the primary window for further additions, and ARES was not included or rumored as a candidate. Several experts note that, historically, S&P 500 additions primarily occur during scheduled quarterly rebalancings, with off-cycle or late-cycle inclusions only arising after unforeseen events such as M&A or bankruptcies among existing constituents, and even then only rarely. While ARES's fundamentals, sector fit, and operational maturity make it a strong eventual candidate (especially as S&P has recently shown openness to alternative asset managers like Blackstone), the absence of news, leaks, or a current catalyst undermines the likelihood of inclusion for the current period. Sector balancing could favor ARES in the future but is not a compelling driver now, particularly since financial sector representation was recently refreshed. Final probabilities assigned by the experts are mostly in the single or low double digits, typically ranging from 3% to 18%, with only one notably higher outlier at 72%, which bases its optimism on strong technical and accounting credentials but still cites some residual uncertainty due to committee discretion. The modal expert view is that unless an unexpected corporate action forces a constituent's removal in the small remaining window, the status quo will hold and ARES will not be announced as a new S&P 500 addition before October 2025.",
