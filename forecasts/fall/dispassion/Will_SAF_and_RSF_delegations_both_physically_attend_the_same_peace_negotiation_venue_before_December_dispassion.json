AU best practice emphasizes that even surges in diplomatic activity rarely translate into simultaneous, physical attendance without months of confidence-building or at least a credible mutually hurting stalemate. The SAF's categorical public rejection of parity with the RSF, the existence of rival governments, and the lack of an empowered, trusted mediator make even a face-saving symbolic meeting unlikely on this timeline.

Critiques of moderate-high probabilities (e.g., 40%) are persuasive in noting that the fine print (simultaneous, physical, formal negotiation) and the absence of scheduled talks or pre-negotiation breakthroughs argue against dramatic upward revision. The 17\u201332% band is well-defended; my initial estimate of 28% sits within this consensus, reflecting a plausible chance of a last-minute, symbolic or externally-imposed meeting, but still recognizing the high likelihood that the status quo persists through the deadline.

Defenses of lower estimates reinforce my own assessment: the historical base rate for such a breakthrough in African civil wars with active rival governments and external sponsors is extremely low, especially on a short timeline. While there is marginal new momentum and a dire humanitarian context, these factors have not yet produced any concrete scheduling or commitments to joint in-person talks.

Defenses of lower probabilities (10-22%) are grounded in robust comparative evidence of how rare such procedural breakthroughs are in similar settings, especially on a short timeline and in the absence of a clear, dominant external enforcer or a mutually recognized stalemate. The only plausible path to YES remains a last-minute, optics-driven symbolic meeting, which is possible but remains remote given the evidence.

The statement acknowledges Sudan\u2019s status as the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian and displacement crisis, with 30 million people\u2014over two-thirds of the population\u2014needing aid and 24 million facing acute food insecurity. The participants condemn the ongoing conflict\u2019s devastating impact on civilians, especially women and children, and emphasize that the suffering over the past two and a half years is unbearable and threatens Sudan\u2019s and the region\u2019s future. The statement calls for the warring parties to resume direct negotiations for a permanent ceasefire, supports EU-led efforts to protect critical infrastructure, endorses the joint statement by the Quad Group on September 12, 2025, and urges all parties to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004) by halting external military and financial support. It reaffirms commitment to Sudan\u2019s sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, rejects parallel governance structures, and demands that the Sudanese people determine their political future through a transparent and inclusive transition. The statement condemns violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by both sides and calls for compliance with the Jeddah Declaration. It reaffirms support for the UN International Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Sudan and the International Criminal Court in holding perpetrators of international crimes accountable. It urges the implementation of a humanitarian truce in El Fasher as proposed by the UN and compliance with UNSC Resolution 2736 (2024). It commends the extension of the Adri border crossing until December 2025 and demands unimpeded, safe access for humanitarian aid across all Sudanese territories, including full access for UN and other international humanitarian personnel in Darfur and Kordofan. Finally, it pledges continued financial and diplomatic support to the humanitarian response and recognizes the exceptional support provided by host countries and local humanitarian actors. The statement is backed by the African Union, the European Union, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Norway.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 09:15 PM\nSource:[France Diplomatie - Minist\u00e8re de l'Europe et des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/ar/dossier-pays/afrique/soudan/evenements-et-visites/article/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9)\n\n**Have the Sudanese Army and Rapid Support Forces Come Close to Negotiations?**\nSince the release of the 'Quadrilateral International Mechanism' roadmap\u2014comprising the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE\u2014in September 2024, intensive regional and international consultations have been underway to open communication channels between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Multiple indicators suggest that the warring parties may soon sit at the negotiating table. U.S. Special Advisor for Africa, Masoud Bolus, stated that both sides are nearing direct talks, with Washington engaging both parties to establish general principles for negotiations. The Quadrilateral urged both sides in a recent statement to accept a three-month humanitarian truce, leading to a permanent ceasefire, followed by a nine-month comprehensive and transparent transition process culminating in a civilian government not controlled by any armed faction. Egyptian Foreign Minister Bader Abdel Ati\u2019s visit to Port Sudan and his meeting with Sudanese Army Commander and head of the Sovereignty Council, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, affirmed the shared stance of the Quadrilateral, emphasizing Egypt\u2019s efforts to end the war through international platforms, including the mechanism, to achieve a humanitarian truce and a political process leading to a Sudanese-Sudanese consensus. Sources familiar with the file confirmed ongoing coordination by the Quadrilateral with all parties at multiple levels, though details were withheld. Babker Faisal, Executive Director of the Unionist Gathering and a senior figure in the 'Somed Alliance' opposing the war, stated on Facebook that signs point to the army and RSF soon returning to negotiations in Jeddah. He emphasized that a humanitarian ceasefire would pave the way for a permanent cessation of hostilities and a civilian-led political process to restore democratic transition. Faisal warned that the greatest challenge for civilian forces is building a broad coalition, as any political success depends on full civilian ownership of the agenda and participants. He stressed that internal will is the decisive factor for peace and its sustainability, which cannot come from bilateral deals but from a comprehensive solution addressing the root causes of the war. He also warned that the former Islamist regime (the previous government) may use all means to block peace efforts and called for unified action to isolate and defeat its strategy of prolonging war. The army-led government welcomed the initiative but rejected equality between the army and RSF, while the RSF, which also runs a parallel government, welcomed any international effort addressing the war\u2019s root causes. A former Sudanese diplomat told Al-Sharq al-Awsat that the U.S. has shown serious commitment to resolving the conflict, working to align the positions of the Quadrilateral for coordinated action and support for the Trump administration\u2019s vision of a peaceful, mutually agreed resolution. The diplomat stated that all indications suggest the warring parties have no choice but to respond positively to the initiative, which represents a widely accepted regional and international vision for ending the war and resolving the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. Political analyst Abdullah Razeg told Al-Sharq al-Awsat that the Quadrilateral\u2019s initiative has received unprecedented international support from the UN, African Union, and EU, along with strong backing from regional and global actors\u2014key factors for its potential success. He confirmed that direct and indirect contacts have already begun with the main belligerents at various levels, preparing the ground for high-level negotiations. Razeg noted that the Quadrilateral\u2019s plan aligns closely with demands from Sudanese civil society and popular movements: a ceasefire to deliver humanitarian aid and protect civilians, followed by a Sudanese-Sudanese dialogue to restore the transitional period. These goals are widely accepted both domestically and internationally, strengthening efforts to isolate and pressure the warring factions. He also suggested that international powers, especially the U.S., may increase pressure on the recalcitrant party refusing a peaceful resolution, particularly given the regional and international consensus that no side can win through military victory. Razeg concluded that the chances of the warring parties entering negotiations are now higher than ever, with the only viable path forward being to seize this opportunity for peace, as other political alternatives are rapidly diminishing. He referenced a joint meeting in New York during the UN General Assembly, attended by representatives from the African Union, EU, and foreign ministers of France, Germany, and the UK, calling for the resumption of direct negotiations between the Sudanese army and RSF to achieve a permanent ceasefire.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0628\u0629](https://www.alrakoba.net/32128002/%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A/)\n\n**AU Paralysis Fuelling Sudan's Humanitarian Catastrophe**\nThe article highlights the escalating humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan, now in its third year of conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. Over 13 million people have been displaced, making Sudan the world\u2019s largest displacement emergency, while more than 25 million face critical food insecurity and at least 150,000 have died from war, famine, or disease. Despite widespread destruction\u2014including the bombing of mosques and hospitals\u2014Sudan receives minimal international media attention compared to conflicts in Gaza or Ukraine. The author, Kim Heller, argues that the lack of global focus reflects a racial hierarchy of suffering and calls attention to the role of foreign powers in perpetuating the crisis. According to the article, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are accused of supporting SAF, while the UAE has allegedly armed the RSF. The United States, though positioning itself as a peace broker, is seen as having strategic interests in Sudan\u2019s gold, oil, and Red Sea access. Despite a brief UN ceasefire proposal in September 2024, no arms embargo was established, and foreign interference continues. The African Union (AU), despite its mandate of 'African solutions to African problems,' has failed to act decisively, outsourcing its role to foreign powers (the 'Quad' of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and the US) and avoiding condemnation of external actors fueling the war. The article urges the AU to convene an African-led peace forum, demand an immediate end to foreign arms supply, and ensure civilian-led rebuilding in Sudan. It concludes by asserting that Sudanese lives are no less valuable than those in Gaza or Kyiv, and that global inaction constitutes moral complicity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 08:39 AM\nSource:[IOL](https://iol.co.za/pretoria-news/opinion/2025-10-03-au-paralysis-fuelling-sudans-humanitarian-catastrophe/)\n\n**'Foreign Affairs': The War in Sudan as a Preview of Future Conflicts**\nThe article from the American magazine 'Foreign Affairs' analyzes the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which has lasted for two and a half years, and examines a new joint roadmap announced by the 'Quadrilateral'\u2014Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the United States\u2014for ending the conflict. The plan calls for a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a Sudanese-led political process to form a new civilian government. Despite initial optimism, the plan faces major obstacles: the Sudanese Armed Forces have publicly rejected it, fighting continues without interruption, and the U.S. is seen as lacking the sustained engagement needed for success. The article argues that the decline of U.S. influence in the Horn of Africa\u2014due to strategic realignments and the rise of regional powers like the UAE and Saudi Arabia\u2014has forced reliance on less effective multilateral frameworks. The UAE and Egypt support the Sudanese Armed Forces (led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan), while Saudi Arabia maintains a formal neutrality but provides diplomatic and economic backing. The UAE is also accused of indirectly supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), through logistical networks, including via Libya. Regional powers such as Turkey, Qatar, and Iran have also entered the conflict, increasing its complexity. The article notes that the war has become a proxy battleground for regional competition, with external actors pursuing economic, strategic, and geopolitical interests. The conflict has caused an estimated 150,000 deaths, displaced a quarter of Sudan\u2019s 50 million population, and devastated infrastructure. The article concludes that the war in Sudan is a harbinger of future conflicts\u2014complex, multi-layered, and resistant to resolution due to competing external interests, advanced weaponry, and the absence of a single power capable of enforcing peace. It also highlights that the U.S. has significantly reduced its diplomatic and operational presence in the region, while regional powers have expanded their influence through investments and mediation efforts, often with conflicting agendas.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 06:40 AM\nSource:[\u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0646](https://www.almayadeen.net/press/-%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%B2---%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A3%D8%AA%D9%8A)\n\n**Joint Statement by International Participants on Coordinating Efforts to De-escalate the Crisis in Sudan (New York, September 24, 2025)**\nOn September 24, 2025, representatives from the African Union, the European Union, and foreign ministers of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom convened in New York with officials from Canada, Chad, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Kenya, Saudi Arabia, the Arab League, Libya, Norway, Qatar, South Sudan, Switzerland, Turkey, Uganda, the UAE, the United Nations, and the United States to coordinate efforts toward de-escalation in Sudan.

All participants expressed deep concern over the 'terrible' conditions in the city, where civilians are enduring unimaginable violence and humanitarian suffering amid ongoing hostilities. The UK mission stated in a press release that civilians in al-Fasher face 'unbelievable violence and violations, and deteriorating humanitarian conditions' due to continued fighting. The participants urged all warring parties, particularly the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), to implement an humanitarian ceasefire in al-Fasher and comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2736, which demands the lifting of the siege, a complete halt to hostilities, and de-escalation in the city and surrounding areas. The UK mission strongly condemned violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including war crimes, and emphasized that all armed groups are responsible for their actions, calling on all parties to respect their commitments under the Jeddah Declaration. The statement reiterated support for negotiations between warring factions to achieve a permanent nationwide ceasefire and protect civilian lives, stressing that the Sudanese people must determine their political future through a genuine, transparent, and credible transitional process led by Sudanese ownership. The conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces erupted in April 2023 over disagreements regarding plans for a political transition to civilian rule and the removal of military figures from power. The war has triggered one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises, with over 12 million Sudanese displaced internally and externally, and nearly half the population on the brink of famine.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0628\u0629](https://www.alrakoba.net/32128004/%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%8816-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D9%82%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B6/)\n\n**Have the Sudanese Army and Rapid Support Forces Come Close to Negotiations?**\nSince the release of the 'Quadrilateral International Mechanism' roadmap\u2014comprising the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE\u2014in September 2024, intensive regional and international consultations have been underway to open communication channels between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Multiple indicators suggest that the warring parties may soon sit at the negotiating table. U.S. Special Advisor for Africa, Masoud Bolus, stated that both sides are nearing direct talks, with Washington engaging both parties to establish general principles for negotiations. The Quadrilateral urged both sides in a recent statement to accept a three-month humanitarian truce, leading to a permanent ceasefire, followed by a nine-month comprehensive and transparent transition process culminating in a civilian government not controlled by any armed faction. Egyptian Foreign Minister Bader Abdel Ati\u2019s visit to Port Sudan and his meeting with Sudanese Army Commander and head of the Sovereignty Council, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, affirmed the shared stance of the Quadrilateral, emphasizing Egypt\u2019s efforts to end the war through international platforms, including the mechanism, to achieve a humanitarian truce and a political process leading to a Sudanese-Sudanese consensus. Sources familiar with the file confirmed ongoing coordination by the Quadrilateral with all parties at multiple levels, though details were withheld. Babker Faisal, Executive Director of the Unionist Gathering and a senior figure in the 'Somed Alliance' opposing the war, stated on Facebook that signs point to the army and RSF soon returning to negotiations in Jeddah. He emphasized that a humanitarian ceasefire would pave the way for a permanent cessation of hostilities and a civilian-led political process to restore democratic transition. Faisal warned that the greatest challenge for civilian forces is building a broad coalition, as any political success depends on full civilian ownership of the agenda and participants. He stressed that internal will is the decisive factor for peace and its sustainability, which cannot come from bilateral deals but from a comprehensive solution addressing the root causes of the war. He also warned that the former Islamist regime (the previous government) may use all means to block peace efforts and called for unified action to isolate and defeat its strategy of prolonging war. The army-led government welcomed the initiative but rejected equality between the army and RSF, while the RSF, which also runs a parallel government, welcomed any international effort addressing the war\u2019s root causes. A former Sudanese diplomat told Al-Sharq al-Awsat that the U.S. has shown serious commitment to resolving the conflict, working to align the positions of the Quadrilateral for coordinated action and support for the Trump administration\u2019s vision of a peaceful, mutually agreed resolution. The diplomat stated that all indications suggest the warring parties have no choice but to respond positively to the initiative, which represents a widely accepted regional and international vision for ending the war and resolving the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. Political analyst Abdullah Razeg told Al-Sharq al-Awsat that the Quadrilateral\u2019s initiative has received unprecedented international support from the UN, African Union, and EU, along with strong backing from regional and global actors\u2014key factors for its potential success. He confirmed that direct and indirect contacts have already begun with the main belligerents at various levels, preparing the ground for high-level negotiations. Razeg noted that the Quadrilateral\u2019s plan aligns closely with demands from Sudanese civil society and popular movements: a ceasefire to deliver humanitarian aid and protect civilians, followed by a Sudanese-Sudanese dialogue to restore the transitional period. These goals are widely accepted both domestically and internationally, strengthening efforts to isolate and pressure the warring factions. He also suggested that international powers, especially the U.S., may increase pressure on the recalcitrant party refusing a peaceful resolution, particularly given the regional and international consensus that no side can win through military victory. Razeg concluded that the chances of the warring parties entering negotiations are now higher than ever, with the only viable path forward being to seize this opportunity for peace, as other political alternatives are rapidly diminishing. He referenced a joint meeting in New York during the UN General Assembly, attended by representatives from the African Union, EU, and foreign ministers of France, Germany, and the UK, calling for the resumption of direct negotiations between the Sudanese army and RSF to achieve a permanent ceasefire.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0628\u0629](https://www.alrakoba.net/32128002/%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A/)\n\n**British Anthropologist: The Silent Weapon of Starvation Is Now Used in Gaza and Sudan**\nAccording to British anthropologist Alex de Wall, the weapon of starvation is being used with brutality against civilians in modern conflicts, transforming food\u2014a fundamental necessity of life\u2014into a weapon of war, a tool of humiliation, and a silent weapon of annihilation. The article, published in Foreign Affairs, highlights that this tactic is evident in Gaza, Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Syria, and other conflict zones, where hunger is a deliberate outcome of warfare and policy, not a natural disaster. The author cites data from the UN\u2019s Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) and the US-based Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which classify food insecurity in five escalating phases. Gaza is currently at Phase 5\u2014\u2018catastrophe\u2019\u2014described as a \u2018man-made crisis\u2019 that can be stopped and reversed. Around 22 million people, nearly half the population of Sudan, are in Phase 3\u2014\u2018crisis\u2019\u2014requiring aid to avoid a downward spiral into famine and destitution. In Sudan, the ongoing war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) under General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) under Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo \u2018Hemedti\u2019 has led to a collapse in food security. The RSF has imposed a 500-day siege on El Fasher, trapping 250,000 people without food. The SAF, meanwhile, has used UN recognition of its government to block aid to areas controlled by its rivals. Despite a UN humanitarian appeal reduced to covering only two-thirds of the affected population and funded at just 25% by September 2024, and a UN Security Council resolution in June 2024 demanding aid access, Russia vetoed a stronger resolution in November 2024, citing \u2018Sudan\u2019s sovereignty.\u2019 A quadrilateral plan by the US, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and others to halt fighting and open humanitarian corridors remains unimplemented. In Gaza, data from August 2025 shows that over 30% of the population\u201410 percentage points above the official famine threshold\u2014receive no food. The article attributes this to Israel\u2019s full blockade from March 2025, which banned food and medicine. After international pressure, Israel allowed limited aid but redirected it through the newly created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, under military control. This replaced 400 UN-run distribution points with just four\u2014three in the south, one in the center\u2014with no presence in northern Gaza. The author notes widespread violence during distribution, with over 1,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or private security firms. De Wall calls for a new international treaty, akin to those banning landmines and cluster munitions, to define starvation as a war crime, establish independent monitoring, and impose political and economic sanctions on those who weaponize hunger. He also urges long-term, politically independent humanitarian funding and the use of satellite imagery and AI to detect early signs of famine. According to Al Jazeera, these technologies could enable faster, more effective interventions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[sudafax.com](https://sudafax.com/507054/%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%b7%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a-%d8%b3%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%ad-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a5%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%af%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b5%d8%a7%d9%85%d8%aa%d8%a9-%d9%8a%d8%b3%d8%aa)\n\n**Ukrainian mercenaries backing rebels in Sudan war killed - army  --  RT Africa**\nThe Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) reported on October 3, 2025, that they had killed 'a large number' of foreign fighters, including Ukrainian mercenaries, supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the besieged city of El Fasher, North Darfur. The SAF stated that the 'special operation' conducted by the 6th Infantry Division and allied units inflicted 'heavy losses in lives and equipment' on RSF forces. Among those killed were mercenaries from Colombia and Ukraine, including individuals described as 'engineers in the field of drones and electronic systems' who attempted to infiltrate neighborhoods around El Fasher. The conflict, which erupted in April 2023 between SAF chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), has led to the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, with nearly 12 million people displaced as of September 2025, according to the UNHCR. The UN reports thousands killed and half the population facing acute food insecurity due to siege warfare, civilian strikes, and blocked aid. Sudan has accused the UAE of financing the RSF, citing an August incident where Sudanese air force destroyed an Emirati aircraft carrying Colombian militants, killing at least 40. In June, a Sudanese Foreign Ministry official claimed Ukraine was arming the RSF and doing the West\u2019s 'dirty work' by supporting armed groups in Libya, Somalia, and Niger. Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger have jointly accused Ukraine of abetting terrorism in the Sahel and filed a complaint with the UN Security Council.

Over 13 million people have been displaced, making Sudan the world\u2019s largest displacement emergency, while more than 25 million face critical food insecurity and at least 150,000 have died from war, famine, or disease. Despite widespread destruction\u2014including the bombing of mosques and hospitals\u2014Sudan receives minimal international media attention compared to conflicts in Gaza or Ukraine. The author, Kim Heller, argues that the lack of global focus reflects a racial hierarchy of suffering and calls attention to the role of foreign powers in perpetuating the crisis. According to the article, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are accused of supporting SAF, while the UAE has allegedly armed the RSF. The United States, though positioning itself as a peace broker, is seen as having strategic interests in Sudan\u2019s gold, oil, and Red Sea access. Despite a brief UN ceasefire proposal in September 2024, no arms embargo was established, and foreign interference continues. The African Union (AU), despite its mandate of 'African solutions to African problems,' has failed to act decisively, outsourcing its role to foreign powers (the 'Quad' of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and the US) and avoiding condemnation of external actors fueling the war. The article urges the AU to convene an African-led peace forum, demand an immediate end to foreign arms supply, and ensure civilian-led rebuilding in Sudan. It concludes by asserting that Sudanese lives are no less valuable than those in Gaza or Kyiv, and that global inaction constitutes moral complicity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 08:39 AM\nSource:[IOL](https://iol.co.za/pretoria-news/opinion/2025-10-03-au-paralysis-fuelling-sudans-humanitarian-catastrophe/)\n\n**'Foreign Affairs': The War in Sudan as a Preview of Future Conflicts**\nThe article from the American magazine 'Foreign Affairs' analyzes the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which has lasted for two and a half years, and examines a new joint roadmap announced by the 'Quadrilateral'\u2014Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the United States\u2014for ending the conflict. The plan calls for a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a Sudanese-led political process to form a new civilian government. Despite initial optimism, the plan faces major obstacles: the Sudanese Armed Forces have publicly rejected it, fighting continues without interruption, and the U.S. is seen as lacking the sustained engagement needed for success. The article argues that the decline of U.S. influence in the Horn of Africa\u2014due to strategic realignments and the rise of regional powers like the UAE and Saudi Arabia\u2014has forced reliance on less effective multilateral frameworks. The UAE and Egypt support the Sudanese Armed Forces (led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan), while Saudi Arabia maintains a formal neutrality but provides diplomatic and economic backing. The UAE is also accused of indirectly supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), through logistical networks, including via Libya. Regional powers such as Turkey, Qatar, and Iran have also entered the conflict, increasing its complexity. The article notes that the war has become a proxy battleground for regional competition, with external actors pursuing economic, strategic, and geopolitical interests. The conflict has caused an estimated 150,000 deaths, displaced a quarter of Sudan\u2019s 50 million population, and devastated infrastructure. The article concludes that the war in Sudan is a harbinger of future conflicts\u2014complex, multi-layered, and resistant to resolution due to competing external interests, advanced weaponry, and the absence of a single power capable of enforcing peace. It also highlights that the U.S. has significantly reduced its diplomatic and operational presence in the region, while regional powers have expanded their influence through investments and mediation efforts, often with conflicting agendas.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 06:40 AM\nSource:[\u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0646](https://www.almayadeen.net/press/-%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%B2---%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A3%D8%AA%D9%8A)\n\n**Sudan: Those Responsible for Sudan's War Have No Business Being Involved in the Peace**\nThe war in Sudan has caused up to 150,000 deaths in mass casualty incidents and over 500,000 deaths due to hunger and starvation, according to humanitarian reports. The UN General Assembly (UNGA) concluded with limited substantive attention to Sudan, despite the crisis being described as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Over 11.8 million people have been displaced\u20147 million internally and over 3 million externally\u2014due to the conflict. The primary responsibility lies with the two main belligerents: the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), both of whom orchestrated a coup in October 2021 and initiated the war in April 2023. As such, they have no legitimate role in Sudan\u2019s post-war future, which must be civilian-led. The Quad proposed a three-month humanitarian pause, a permanent ceasefire, and a nine-month transitional process leading to civilian governance\u2014welcomed tentatively by Sudanese civic and anti-war groups, including outreach to the RSF\u2019s parallel government. Despite numerous regional and international mechanisms\u2014including the IGAD Special Envoy, AU Peace and Security Council, AU Panel of the Wise, and multiple mediation efforts\u2014no progress has been made. External actors have continued arming and financing the belligerents, and the conflict persists. The article questions whether the new US stance or the Quad\u2019s apparent shift will lead to real change, while expressing skepticism toward IGAD and the AU, which have failed to move the needle despite a 'plethora of mechanisms.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 12:18 PM\nSource:[allafrica.com](https://allafrica.com/stories/202510020357.html)\n\n**Sudan\u2019s War as a Blueprint for Africa\u2019s Future: Escalation, Regional Rivalry, and the Collapse of Peace Efforts**\nThe Sudanese civil war, which began in April 2023, has drawn in regional and international powers, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the United States forming the 'Quad' to mediate a peace process. On September 12, 2024, the Quad announced a joint roadmap for a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a Sudanese-led political transition. However, the plan has stalled: fighting continues, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have publicly rejected the proposal, and no consensus has emerged among the external actors. The conflict pits SAF, backed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Algeria, Iran, and Qatar, against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), supported by the UAE, Chad, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya\u2019s eastern forces, Somalia, South Sudan, and Uganda. The UAE denies directly arming the RSF, but intelligence reports from African, Arab, U.S., and European officials suggest they are behind a major logistical supply chain through Libya. The UAE\u2019s involvement is driven by strategic interests in controlling Red Sea ports and expanding influence across the Horn of Africa, rather than solely resource acquisition. Saudi Arabia, officially neutral, has strengthened diplomatic and economic support for SAF due to regional security concerns, including the risk of instability spreading to the Red Sea and threatening its economic ambitions. The collapse of U.S. leadership in the region\u2014marked by reduced diplomatic staffing, diminished strategic priority, and a shift toward China-focused foreign policy\u2014has created a power vacuum filled by regional middle powers. The World Economic Forum (April 2024) reported that the UAE invested $59 billion in Africa (fourth-largest foreign direct investor), and Saudi Arabia invested $26 billion, with significant focus on the Horn of Africa. These investments have fueled competition, undermining unified peace efforts. The Peace Research Institute Oslo (2024) found that African conflicts have doubled in the last decade, with civil wars increasingly internationalized, as third-party states support both sides. In Sudan, this has resulted in a fragmented peace process with no central mediator. Attempts by the U.S., Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to broker peace have repeatedly failed due to lack of coordination and competing interests. The second Trump administration\u2019s efforts, led by Massad Boulos, also faltered after SAF leadership distanced itself from the agreement and the RSF intensified military operations. The war has become increasingly technologically advanced, with long-range drones used in attacks on Port Sudan\u2014across the Red Sea from Jeddah\u2014indicating a regional escalation. The conflict has already caused up to 150,000 deaths, displaced a quarter of Sudan\u2019s 50 million population, and destroyed infrastructure. The absence of a single power with authority to compel all parties to negotiate, combined with the deep entrenchment of rival alliances, has rendered lasting peace unattainable. The war in Sudan is now seen as a prototype for future African conflicts: complex, protracted, and driven by competing external interests, with peace agreements limited to freezing the status quo. The risk of spillover into neighboring conflicts, such as the fragile peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea, is growing, with regional alignment already polarizing along pro-SAF and pro-RSF lines.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 10:46 AM\nSource:[rightsreporter.org](https://www.rightsreporter.org/guerra-in-sudan-scontro-tra-potenze-arabe-mostra-futuro-africa/)\n\n**The Guardian view on catastrophe in Darfur: The world has looked away, but Sudan's civilians can't wait any longer | Editorial**\nThe Guardian editorial argues that the brutal war in Darfur, especially the 500\u2011day siege of El\u202fFasher by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.  It cites that an estimated 260,000 civilians face a choice between starvation, an airstrike or fleeing to risk rape, robbery and death, that about 150,000 people have been killed, that 12\u202fmillion have been displaced and that almost 25\u202fmillion are suffering acute hunger.  The piece criticises the international community for focusing on Ukraine and Gaza, noting that only in the run\u2011up to the UN General Assembly did the US, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE call for a three\u2011month truce to allow aid, while the African Union, EU and UK urged direct talks.  It accuses Egypt and Saudi Arabia of supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the UAE of supplying arms to the RSF, and calls for sustained diplomatic pressure, warning that the war could be driven by outside interference.

The four\u2011country coalition announced its commitment to a set of principles in mid\u2011September, with the aim of stopping the killings and ending the conflict.  The war has raged for two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half years, killing tens of thousands and possibly hundreds of thousands of people, and has created the largest displacement crisis in the contemporary world, according to the United Nations.  The initiative has generated what diplomats describe as \u2018ein gewisses Momentum\u2019, and has led to high\u2011level talks at the UN General Assembly in New\u202fYork.  Western states\u2014including Germany, the EU and the African Union\u2014have urged the Sudanese parties to start direct talks for a permanent cease\u2011fire, supporting the Quad\u2019s principle that the conflict cannot be solved militarily and that a civilian\u2011led transition must be pursued.  The Quad\u2019s most concrete goal is a three\u2011month cease\u2011fire that would lead to an indefinite truce.  However, skepticism remains: the UAE is alleged to provide financial, logistical and possibly weapons support to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which are fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) led by General Abdel\u202fFattah al\u2011Burhan and backed by Egypt.  The RSF has besieged the city of El\u202fFasher in Darfur for months, threatening famine, executions, torture and sexual violence.  The initiative also faces resistance from Islamist groups and deep mistrust between RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemeti) and SAF commander al\u2011Burhan, which could hinder direct negotiations.  In short, the Quad seeks to impose a civilian\u2011led political transition and a lasting cease\u2011fire, but its success depends on whether the involved states can enforce pressure on the warring factions and whether the parties will honour the agreed principles.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 12:23 PM\nSource:[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/sudan-quad-initiative-usa-aegypten-saudi-arabien-uae-li.3318015)\n\n**Egypt joins regional, global powers in push to end Sudan war**\nEgypt, together with the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom, issued a joint statement on Friday as part of the International Quartet on Sudan, calling for a three\u2011month humanitarian truce that would lead to a permanent ceasefire and a nine\u2011month inclusive transition to an independent civilian government that 'meets the aspirations of the Sudanese people' (article).

Khartoum has been heavily bombarded and atrocities in Darfur have prompted warnings of possible ethnic cleansing (article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 10:50 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/1234/552938/Egypt/Foreign-Affairs/Egypt-joins-regional,-global-powers-in-push-to-end.aspx)\n\n**Washington Celebrates Peace Efforts After a Year of Stalemate**\nOn 11\u202fAugust, a three\u2011hour meeting in Zurich between Sudan\u2019s Armed Forces commander Gen. Abdel\u202fFattah al\u2011Barhan and former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Africa adviser Mike Pols marked the first serious progress in Sudan peace talks in a year. The meeting, which was brokered by Qatar and kept secret, prompted UAE Deputy Ruler Sheikh Mansour bin\u202fZayed Al\u202fNahyan, national\u2011security adviser, to travel to Zurich the next day to meet Pols. Pols had previously failed to secure a breakthrough at the June\u202f2024 Quad Group (U.S., UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia) summit and at a Geneva initiative a year earlier. He now aims to re\u2011establish a Quad Group meeting to demonstrate that a U.S.\u2011led format still works and to keep the UN and AU out of high\u2011risk military negotiations. The article also describes the complex regional dynamics: Egypt insists the Sudanese Armed Forces and the newly appointed government lead the transition, while the UAE opposes the inclusion of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces in the transition. The RSF, led by Maj.\u202fGen. Mohamed\u202fHamdan\u202fDagalo, known as \u2018Hemaiti\u2019, is supported by the UAE and has split the country. Pols intends to hold a Quad Group meeting to show U.S. leadership remains viable, but the U.S. has not yet identified a clear strategy for ending the war and must first identify civilians it can work with. The article notes that the U.S. cannot deliver humanitarian aid without negotiating with RSF or Barhan\u2019s forces, who hold veto power over aid distribution, and that the U.S. has not yet faced significant opposition from regional backers of the RSF. Pols is also considering the RSF as a potential next target. The article is from Al\u2011Rakoba newspaper, published 31\u202fAugust\u202f2025.

Africa calls for Sudanese owned and Sudanese led inclusive dialogue**\nSouth Africa has issued a statement expressing solidarity with Sudan\u2019s civilians, particularly women and children, amid the ongoing armed conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The statement notes that since 15\u202fApril\u202f2023 the war has caused significant civilian casualties and displacement, citing a recent brutal attack on El\u202fFasher \u2013 the capital of North\u202fDarfur, which has been besieged for over 500\u202fdays \u2013 where heavy artillery killed about 24 people and wounded 55, including five women. South Africa urges an immediate end to the fighting and a return to genuine, sincere negotiations, calling for a Sudanese\u2011owned and Sudanese\u2011led inclusive dialogue that would lead to a civilian\u2011led, democratic government. The statement also stresses the need for parties to respect international humanitarian law, allow humanitarian access, and provide critical medical support, especially in El\u202fFasher. President Cyril\u202fRamaphosa is said to have repeatedly encouraged the warring parties to return to the negotiation table. South Africa reiterates its full support for the United Nations Secretary\u2011General\u2019s Personal Envoy to Sudan, Mr\u202fRamtane\u202fLamamra, the African Union (AU) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in mediating a peaceful resolution. The article, published by the Global Partnership for Education on 30\u202fAugust\u202f2025, frames the call as a diplomatic effort to secure sustainable peace and freedom for Sudan\u2019s people.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 30, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[Global Partnership for Education](https://www.africa-newsroom.com/press/south-africa-calls-for-sudanese-owned-and-sudanese-led-inclusive-dialogue)\n\n**Sudan's Al-Burhan Rejects Peace with Rapid Support Forces**\nSudanese General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has rejected any 'peace or reconciliation' with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as 'Hemetti'. Al-Burhan stated, 'We will not accept any settlement that keeps the RSF as a separate entity outside the regular military system.' This comes after a meeting between al-Burhan and US Presidential Envoy for Africa, Ambassador Samantha Power, in Switzerland, where they discussed a proposed US ceasefire and humanitarian aid plan. However, previous negotiations facilitated by the US and Saudi Arabia have not led to any breakthroughs towards a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the RSF continues to attempt to consolidate its control over large areas in western Sudan, announcing plans to establish a parallel civilian administration, which has sparked international outrage. The UN has described the situation in Sudan as one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with tens of thousands killed and millions displaced since the conflict began in April 2023. The European Union has called for immediate access to humanitarian aid, warning of a further escalation of the humanitarian crisis if the blockade and lack of basic services continue.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 14, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a21](https://arabi21.com/story/1700735/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B6%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D9%85%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A9)\n\n**Sudanese Army Chief Rejects 'Conciliation' with Rapid Support Forces**\nSudanese army chief and de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has rejected 'conciliation' with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) which has been waging war against them for over two years. The US is intensifying its diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in Sudan, which has been plagued by 'the worst humanitarian crisis in the world' according to the UN. In a speech marking the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the armed forces, al-Burhan reiterated his 'determination to continue the battle of dignity and defeat the rebellion and reject conciliation and compromise, no matter the cost'. This comes days after a meeting in Switzerland with US National Security Adviser for Africa, Maasoum Boulos. A Sudanese government source confirmed that al-Burhan and Boulos discussed an American proposal for a 'comprehensive ceasefire' and 'delivering humanitarian aid'. Despite US and Saudi efforts, attempts at mediation have so far failed to achieve a ceasefire in Sudan. The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, is seeking to establish a parallel administration in western Sudan in areas under its control. The UN Security Council strongly condemned this move, calling it a 'direct threat to Sudan's unity and territorial integrity'. The war that broke out in April 2023 has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions. Sudan is also facing its worst cholera outbreak in years. The EU has called on the warring parties to allow international humanitarian aid to enter the country 'as soon as possible'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 14, 2025 04:53 PM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**US Mediation Efforts Fail to End Sudan War**\nA new attempt at mediation to end the deadly war in Sudan has failed, with the US unable to bring together key international actors in Washington. On the ground, the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are setting up rival governments and seeking to expand their territorial control, with fierce fighting in North Darfur and Kordofan (west). Since April 2023, the war between General Abdel Fattah al-Burhane, head of the army, and his former deputy Mohamed Daglo, also known as 'Hemedti', commander of the RSF, has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions, causing what the UN calls the 'worst humanitarian crisis in the world', with destruction, famine, and cholera. - Diplomatic disagreements - Several mediation initiatives have already been launched, including in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Geneva, Switzerland, but none have succeeded. In early July, US President Donald Trump highlighted the efforts of his administration for peace in Africa. 'There is still much to be done, particularly in countries like Sudan, where there are many problems.' The US diplomacy had planned to bring together the Saudi, Egyptian, and Emirati foreign ministers, in the absence of the rival Sudanese parties. However, this quadripartite meeting was cancelled due to a disagreement between Egypt and the UAE, according to AFP information. According to a diplomatic source, the UAE had proposed, at the last minute, a text excluding both the army and the RSF from any future transition, a clause considered 'totally unacceptable' by Cairo. Additionally, 'the US were not ready because they had eliminated the personnel working on Sudan' during the recent restructuring of the State Department, which deprived them of any 'institutional memory' on the negotiation process, according to Sudanese analyst Kholood Khair. For the pro-army governor of Darfur, Mini Minawi, the diplomatic deadlock reveals a disconnect between international mediations and the realities on the ground, when it should be 'acting on the opinions expressed by the Sudanese and not by foreign countries'. 'We think that the UAE is not qualified to lead a mediation (...) because the RSF are fed and supported by the UAE,' he said on Monday. Abu Dhabi has always denied any involvement in the conflict, despite several reports by UN experts and international organizations accusing it of arming paramilitaries. Cairo, on the other hand, supports the power of General al-Burhane and considers it the only legitimate actor. - 'Absence of will' - For Bakri Eljack, spokesperson for the civil coalition Sumoud led by former Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, 'in the absence of a genuine internal will', it is unlikely that the US and major regional powers will achieve results. The failure of the Washington meeting 'will have no impact on the ground, as the armed forces do not attach importance to it since the situation on the ground has changed' in their favor, unlike the RSF, 'confronted with setbacks and internal divisions,' estimates military expert and former General Tarek Abdelkarim. On the other hand, Alaa Naqd, spokesperson for the Tassiss, a coalition grouping the RSF, armed movements and civil groups, estimated that the sine die postponement of the quadripartite meeting should not be interpreted 'as a failure' but as a 'first attempt by the Trump administration to deal with the Sudanese dossier.' For the Americans, it was a matter of 'sounding out the opinions of its allies in the region,' he said to AFP from Nyala, capital of South Darfur. Since a few weeks, each of the two rival camps is trying to assert its legitimacy. The recently appointed Prime Minister by the military power, Kamel Idriss, is seeking to re-establish his new government in Khartoum, the capital recaptured by the army in late May. In parallel, the RSF have also designated their own Prime Minister, Mohamed Hassan al-Ta'ayshi, and begun to form a rival administration, particularly in Darfur. The African Union has called on Tuesday not to recognize this rival government, estimating that this initiative compromises 'peace efforts and the very future of Sudan.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 06:10 PM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**UN Security Council to Hold Open Session on Sudan Crisis**\nThe United Nations Security Council is set to hold an open session on Friday, June 27, to discuss the developments in the Sudan crisis. The session will be part of the regular briefings provided by the UN Secretary-General on the situation in the country, which has become one of the worst humanitarian and armed conflicts in the world in recent years. According to diplomatic sources, the Council is expected to listen to a comprehensive briefing by the UN Special Representative to Sudan, Ramadan al-Mamur, covering the latest political and humanitarian developments, as well as the challenges facing efforts to achieve a lasting ceasefire between the warring parties. The open session will be followed by closed consultations among Council members, during which they will discuss an assessment of the conflict's developments and ways to support ongoing mediation efforts at both regional and international levels. The conflict, which has entered its third year, has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands and the displacement of over 10 million people inside and outside the country, amidst a near-total collapse of government institutions and essential services, including healthcare and education. Reports indicate an escalation of attacks on civilians and vital infrastructure, prompting dozens of humanitarian organizations to suspend or significantly reduce their activities, due to the lack of guarantees for the protection of humanitarian workers and civilian facilities. Despite the efforts of international and regional forces, including the 'Jeddah Initiative' led by the US and Saudi Arabia, as well as the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), negotiations have yet to yield tangible progress, amidst mutual accusations of obstructing peace paths and failing to adhere to a ceasefire. Observers expect the upcoming Security Council session to increase political and diplomatic pressure on the warring parties, raise the level of coordination between the UN and regional partners to push for peace efforts, and prevent further collapse in Sudan. The international community remains hopeful that the Sudanese parties will demonstrate a genuine political will to transition from a cycle of violence to a dialogue table and address the roots of the crisis comprehensively and sustainably.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 25, 2025 04:26 AM\nSource:[alsudantoday.com](https://alsudantoday.com/sudan-news/sudan-now-news/452405)\n\n**UN Security Council to Hold Open Session on Sudan Crisis**\nThe United Nations Security Council is expected to hold an open session on Friday, June 27, to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Sudan and listen to a briefing from the UN Secretary-General's representative, Ramadan Al-Omama. The briefing will cover the deteriorating humanitarian situation, increasing attacks on civilians, and the challenges facing peace efforts and ceasefire negotiations. This comes as Sudan is experiencing its worst crisis since independence, with the ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo 'Hemeti', entering its third year without any significant progress towards a political solution. The conflict has resulted in a major humanitarian disaster, with tens of thousands of deaths and over 10 million people displaced internally and externally. The infrastructure and basic services, including healthcare and education institutions, have also collapsed. Despite regional and international mediation, including the 'Jeddah' track led by the US and Saudi Arabia, the negotiations have not made any tangible progress, with both sides accusing each other of obstructing solutions. As Ramadan Al-Omama said, 'The situation in Sudan is dire and requires immediate attention and action from the international community.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 09:07 PM\nSource:[alsudantoday.com](https://alsudantoday.com/sudan-news/sudan-now-news/452382)\n\n",

    "summary": "The majority of forecasting experts agree that the probability of both Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) delegations physically attending the same peace negotiation venue before December 31, 2025 is low, with estimates ranging from 10% to 40%. Across a variety of perspectives\u2014UN peacemaking, mediation best practices, international relations theories, African Union guidelines, and postcolonial state theory\u2014common themes emerge: \n\n- The status quo is one of entrenched mutual distrust, maximalist preconditions, failed or sequential talks, and avoidance of face-to-face meetings since the war began in April 2023. \n- While there is intensified international and regional pressure, including from the Quad (US, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE), the UN, AU, and EU, historical base rates in similar high-intensity civil wars suggest that simultaneous, physical co-attendance is rare, especially within short timeframes and absent a clear military stalemate or collapse. \n- The risk of spoilers (internal hardliners, external patrons), fragmentation among mediators, and ongoing efforts to delegitimize the rival remain major obstacles. \n- Some slight increase in probability over previous periods is noted due to recent high-level diplomatic activity, rumors of preparatory contacts, and extreme humanitarian catastrophe, but experts stress these are necessary but not sufficient conditions, with no concrete evidence of scheduled or imminent joint attendance. \n- The modal scenario for a 'YES' is a symbolic, externally-choreographed one-off meeting for optics, most likely under extreme pressure or to unlock humanitarian aid, but experts remain skeptical this threshold will be crossed by the deadline. \n- Final probabilities cluster between 10% and 40%, with most in the 20-30% range. The median estimate is around 25-28%. The consensus is that while the odds are slightly better than at any prior point in the war due to rising international urgency, the structural and attitudinal barriers make a substantive breakthrough highly unlikely by the end of 2025.",
