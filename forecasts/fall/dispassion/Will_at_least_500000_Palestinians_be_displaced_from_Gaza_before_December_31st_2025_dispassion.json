Ceasefire agreements now explicitly prohibit displacement and are monitored by a multinational force. While Israeli right-wing figures continue to advocate for 'voluntary migration' and policy documents show some interest in such plans, these have run up against insurmountable practical and diplomatic obstacles.

Since the outbreak of war in October 2023, WHO has supported the medical evacuation of approximately 7,800 patients from Gaza. As of October 10, 2024, under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire, 41 critically ill patients and 145 accompanying relatives have been evacuated under WHO supervision. WHO Representative in Palestine, Rik Peeperkorn, emphasized during a press conference in Geneva via video link from Jerusalem that all crossings to Israel and Egypt must be opened not only for humanitarian aid but also for medical evacuations. He stated that WHO is ready to increase evacuation capacity to at least 50 patients per day, but noted that current rates would require 10 years to evacuate the 15,000 people in need, including 4,000 children. Peeperkorn stressed that fully opening all humanitarian corridors is 'vital' and the 'least costly option,' and highlighted that opening the Rafah Crossing in Egypt would enable medical treatment and travel to other countries. WHO reported over 700 deaths among those awaiting evacuation. So far, more than 20 countries, including Egypt, the UAE, Turkey, and Jordan, have accepted evacuees. Peeperkorn also revealed that Gaza\u2019s healthcare system is severely degraded: only 14 of 36 hospitals and 64 of 181 primary healthcare centers are partially operational. Key facilities such as Kemal Adwan, Al-Awda, Indonesia Hospital, and the European Hospital in Gaza are inaccessible and out of service.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 03:15 PM\nSource:[Asharq Al-awsat  - Turkish](https://turkish.aawsat.com/node/5201254)\n\n**UNRWA calls for entry of winter shelter supplies stuck in Egypt and Jordan**\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has urgently called for the entry of winter shelter supplies and humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, as winter approaches.

The occupation forces have imposed a strict siege, separating northern Gaza from central and southern areas by establishing roadblocks and conducting relentless military operations, including tank and missile strikes, in residential neighborhoods. Access to food, water, and medicine remains severely restricted. Displaced people in the south await the possibility of returning home, uncertain whether their homes still stand. Those remaining in Gaza City and the north face existential questions: Will they survive the ongoing bombardment? Where will they find basic necessities? When will they regain freedom of movement? A resident reflects on the term 'Arabs of 2023,' drawing a parallel to the 'Arabs of 1948' who became refugees after the Nakba. The author warns of a potential repetition of historical displacement, referencing past failed attempts to resettle Palestinians in the Sinai Peninsula, approved by Egypt\u2019s Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1953 but rejected by Palestinians. The article raises concerns that the current assault may lead to the creation of a Palestinian self-governing entity in Gaza under Israeli-American design, aimed at eliminating future resistance. This scenario is seen as increasingly likely, particularly given the disproportionate targeting of children\u201445% of the dead and a similar or higher proportion among the wounded\u2014whose bodies are severely maimed. The central question remains: Who will become the 'Arabs of 2023'?\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 20, 2023 06:12 PM\nSource:[bocchescucite.org](https://bocchescucite.org/voci-da-gaza-giorno-66/)\n\n**WHO Urges Permanent Opening of Humanitarian Corridors from Gaza Strip for Medical Evacuations**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called for the permanent opening of humanitarian corridors from the Gaza Strip, stating that such measures would 'transform the situation' for 15,000 injured Palestinians requiring medical treatment outside the region.

John White, UNRWA\u2019s Deputy Director for Gaza, stated on X (formerly Twitter) that children urgently need education as a foundational step toward recovery and hope, noting that UNRWA remains the largest provider of emergency education in the sector. Since the latest ceasefire, UNRWA has been providing education to approximately 10,000 children daily in designated schools\u2014down from 60,000 during previous calm periods\u2014with ongoing efforts to expand programs, including online learning.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0641\u062f](https://www.alwafd.news/5717242)\n\n**UNRWA: Winter Supplies in Jordan and Egypt Blocked from Entering Gaza**\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) stated on Saturday, October 25, 2025, that winter shelter supplies and essential winter materials for displaced families in Gaza are stored in UNRWA warehouses in Jordan and Egypt but are currently blocked from entering the besieged Gaza Strip.

The ICJ ruled on October 22, 2025, that Palestinians in Gaza have not received sufficient aid and ordered Israel to allow and facilitate humanitarian access, ending the use of starvation as a weapon in the war. This advisory opinion was issued at the request of the UN General Assembly in December 2024.

Since the war with Israel began two years ago, the WHO has facilitated the medical evacuation of nearly 7,800 patients, but an estimated 15,000 people\u2014including 4,000 children\u2014still require treatment outside the Gaza Strip. Despite a US-brokered ceasefire that began on October 10, 2024, only 41 critical patients have been evacuated since then. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO\u2019s representative in the Palestinian territories, emphasized that all crossings into Israel and Egypt must be opened for medical evacuations, particularly to hospitals in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as was routinely done before the war. He stated the WHO is ready to evacuate at least 50 patients per day and expressed concern that, at the current pace, it would take a decade to evacuate all 15,000 patients. He noted that over 700 people have died while waiting for evacuation. Currently, only 14 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are partially functional, serving a population exceeding two million. While over 20 countries have accepted evacuees, only a few have done so in significant numbers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 12:52 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/pleads-sick-gazans-allowed-leave-125231867.html)\n\n**Gaza: Palestinians Endure 'Unimaginable Suffering' as Humanitarian Aid Efforts Face Ongoing Obstacles**\nThe United Nations and its partner organizations are accelerating efforts to deliver life-saving aid to the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip, despite significant challenges posed by imposed restrictions on humanitarian access and overwhelming needs. Since the ceasefire began on October 10, the UN Migration Agency (IOM) has dispatched over 47,000 relief items, including 2,500 tents, to assist families recovering from devastation. UN agency chief Ami Pop expressed deep concern over the 'unimaginable suffering' endured by people in Gaza, emphasizing that shelter is not a luxury but a necessity for rest, dignity, and rebuilding lives. Over 90% of Gaza\u2019s population is estimated to be displaced, with at least 1.5 million people in urgent need of emergency shelter. IOM officials noted that many returning residents find only rubble at their homes, underscoring that recovery cannot begin without secure housing. Despite the ceasefire, delays in approvals, insecurity, and limited border crossing openings continue to hinder aid delivery. UN partners have pre-positioned supplies in Jordan, including over 28,000 additional tents and more than 4 million items for cold weather readiness. UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq reported that partners are now distributing over 1 million hot meals daily across Gaza, supported by six operational bakeries. Over 150 nutrition centers have been established\u2014double the number before the ceasefire\u2014with 20 mobile health and nutrition teams supporting them. In just one week, 1,200 severely malnourished children received therapeutic food. Water and sanitation efforts are ongoing, with millions of diapers and hygiene supplies distributed and 140 new water tanks installed for community-level water supply. Currently, aid is only being delivered via the Kerem Shalom and Kusseima border crossings. Farhan Haq urged Israel to open additional crossings, particularly in northern areas, to improve humanitarian access.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/hi/story/2025/10/1087113)\n\n**WHO Urges Full Opening of Routes for Patient Evacuation and Life-Saving Supplies in Gaza**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has reported progress in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza following the ceasefire agreement that took effect on October 10, 2024, but continues to urge the full opening of all border crossings to enable the evacuation of patients and the delivery of essential medical supplies and goods. WHO Representative Rick Piperkorn, speaking from Jerusalem at a press briefing in Geneva, emphasized that while aid efforts are increasing, 'all border crossings must be opened to deliver diverse food, shelter, and essential items, especially with winter approaching.' He noted that Gaza\u2019s healthcare system is severely damaged, with only around 2,100 hospital beds available for 2.1 million people, and several major medical facilities remain inaccessible due to their location outside the areas cleared by Israeli forces in October. Over 170,000 people have been injured in the conflict, and many cannot access necessary treatment. On Thursday, WHO conducted its first medical evacuation since the ceasefire\u201441 patients and 145 accompanying individuals were transferred to various countries. The organization plans to increase evacuations to 50 patients per day. Piperkorn stressed the importance of restoring medical evacuation routes to hospitals on the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and called for the daily opening of the Rafah crossing for medical evacuations to Egypt. He also urged more countries to accept patients and expressed hope that the newly established U.S.-led Civil-Military Coordinating Center will accelerate aid delivery and future reconstruction efforts. WHO has submitted a consolidated list of medicines and medical supplies used globally and is seeking unified approval for their shipment to reduce delays. 'The path ahead will be long and difficult, with many obstacles,' Piperkorn said, 'but we can only hope this ceasefire holds and we move toward peace and a political solution.' Meanwhile, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has delivered over 47,000 humanitarian aid units to Gaza since the ceasefire, including 31,000 items for shelter\u2014such as 2,500 tents\u2014helping displaced families live in safer, more dignified conditions. IOM Director General Amy Pope stated, 'The people of Gaza have endured unimaginable losses. They need help that arrives quickly and safely, through all possible routes. Shelter is not a luxury\u2014it is essential for families to warm up and begin rebuilding their lives.' According to humanitarian agencies, about 90% of Gaza\u2019s population remains without permanent shelter, and 1.5 million people require urgent assistance. The IOM has prepared millions of essential items for immediate deployment, including 28,000 tents for 168,000 people, blankets, mattresses, hygiene kits, and 4.1 million winter preparedness items. Despite the ceasefire, ongoing challenges include customs delays, limited crossing points, and continued instability, which hinder aid delivery. The IOM remains ready to scale operations as rapidly and extensively as Israeli authorities allow, in accordance with humanitarian principles.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/ru/story/2025/10/1466686)\n\n**Projecting Displacement: Has the Sharm El Sheikh Agreement Ended It or Is It Still a Threat?**\nThe 'Sharm El Sheikh Summit for Peace,' held on October 13, 2025, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, brought together leaders from over 30 countries, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and former U.S. President Donald Trump, to address the ongoing Gaza war that began in October 2023. The summit, a joint Egyptian-American initiative, resulted in the 'Sharm El Sheikh Declaration' or 'Trump's Declaration for Permanent Peace and Prosperity,' which included a ceasefire, prisoner exchange (approximately 20 live Israeli hostages for 2,000 Palestinian prisoners), phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a call for a reconstruction conference in Cairo in November 2025. The declaration explicitly prohibited forced displacement of Palestinians and affirmed their right to return. Despite this, concerns remain about the potential for 'soft displacement' through humanitarian aid, temporary resettlement programs, or international-led reintegration efforts, which could indirectly alter Gaza\u2019s demographic makeup. The absence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2014citing Jewish religious holidays\u2014raised questions about Israel\u2019s full commitment. Right-wing Israeli figures, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Innovation Minister Gila Gamliel, have openly advocated for Jewish settlements in Gaza and 'voluntary migration' of Palestinians, reflecting an ideology that views Gaza as part of 'Greater Israel.' Polls show 82% of Israeli Jews support expelling Gaza\u2019s population, indicating deep-rooted ideological support for such policies. Egypt has played a central role in blocking any displacement, leveraging diplomatic pressure to ensure compliance. Regional coordination through the Arab League and economic leverage\u2014including potential suspension of normalization agreements like Camp David and Abraham\u2014remain tools to counter Israeli violations. International efforts, including support from Russia and China, and legal actions at the UN and International Court of Justice (ICJ), provide additional avenues for accountability. Civil society organizations such as Amnesty International and the IRC lead global campaigns calling for arms embargoes and sanctions. Despite the agreement\u2019s humanitarian significance, it remains fragile due to Israel\u2019s lack of direct participation and the persistent right-wing agenda. The document concludes that lasting peace requires justice, not merely temporary ceasefires, and calls for unified Arab action and broader international coalitions to prevent future displacement and ensure a just resolution.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 06:23 AM\nSource:[\u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0646](https://www.almayadeen.net/articles/%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1--%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%82%D9%81%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A3%D9%85-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AD-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7)\n\n**'I've returned to my home in Gaza - this is what I've come back to'**\nFollowing a ceasefire in Gaza that took effect at 12pm local time on Friday, October 10, 2025, thousands of Palestinians began returning to northern areas of the territory, including Gaza City, after being displaced during Israel's two-year war against Hamas. The ceasefire, brokered by Donald Trump, marked the first phase of a peace deal in which 20 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza were released in exchange for approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees. Widespread aid distribution is expected to resume across the Strip. Two hundred U.S. troops arrived over the weekend to establish a base overseeing the truce, with a multinational taskforce including forces from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE. Residents described the conditions they returned to as 'unlivable,' with the UN reporting that over 90% of residential buildings in Gaza have been destroyed. Ola Amira, a 20-year-old medical student and volunteer with Reviving Gaza, returned to Gaza City after being displaced to Rafah and the Nuseirat refugee camp. She described her emotional state as 'my heart is literally squeezing from pain' and said her family\u2019s immediate reaction after returning was to want to immigrate once borders reopen. This marks the second time Amira and her family have returned during a ceasefire, with their first return earlier in 2025 resulting in them purchasing furniture and a new kitchen only to later feel unstable. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in August that the offensive in Gaza City aimed to destroy Hamas\u2019s 'last stronghold,' displacing around 700,000 people from the city and northern Gaza through aerial bombardment and ground operations. According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 67,194 people have been killed since Hamas\u2019s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, with 53% being women, children, and elderly individuals. The UN reports that over 90% of Palestinians\u20141.9 million people\u2014have been displaced at least once since October 2023. Hamas\u2019s initial attack killed 1,195 people, including 725 civilians, according to Israeli officials, and the Israel Defence Forces confirmed 466 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the subsequent conflict.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/returned-home-gaza-what-ive-come-back-to-3972532)\n\n**Gaza: Endless Displacement \u2014 Hundreds of Thousands Flee South Amid Bombing, No Safe Haven**\nOver a million Palestinians lived in Gaza City before the recent Israeli military offensive, according to estimates. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a negotiation path to end the war between Israel and Hamas, mass displacement continues as civilians flee north to south amid relentless Israeli bombardment. The designated 'humanitarian zone' of Al-Muwaasi, west of Khan Yunis, and central Gaza have both been targeted, resulting in dozens of deaths among displaced persons and refugees in shelters. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that 125,000 out of 135,000 shelters have collapsed over the past two years due to bombing and weather, with 93% no longer habitable. Despite repeated Israeli claims of 'safe zones,' the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights states that markets, aid centers, and gathering points for displaced people have been deliberately targeted, constituting 'clear war crimes aimed at terror and mass extermination.' Israeli media, including Haaretz, report that the Israeli cabinet approved a plan in August 2024 to gradually seize control of Gaza, forcibly displace its population southward and westward, and impose a total blockade. International warnings of an 'imminent humanitarian catastrophe' have been ignored. Doctors Without Borders states that over one million Palestinians face 'renewed terror,' with the displaced unable to flee due to illness, age, or pregnancy, while those who do flee are pursued by airstrikes even in shelters. The organization describes the situation as 'a deliberate, systematic genocide of an unarmed people.' Personal testimonies from displaced individuals like Fadl Moughal, Faris Moughal, and Sumaya Jabar reveal a cycle of repeated displacement, loss of family, poverty, unaffordable rents (up to 20 shekels per square meter), and survival in rubble or open streets. The Gaza government warns that the south can no longer absorb more refugees, especially in Al-Muwaasi, where approximately one million people live without basic living conditions. Hospitals have treated hundreds of casualties from attacks on convoys, constituting 'a gross violation of international humanitarian law.' The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and international human rights organizations are calling on the UN, the Security Council, and the international community to impose urgent protection for civilians, open safe corridors for aid, and halt forced displacement and genocide.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 04:10 PM\nSource:[euronews](http://arabic.euronews.com/2025/10/05/gaza-endless-displacement-hundreds-of-thousands-head-south-escape-bombings-and-without)\n\n**More than 900,000 Palestinians resist forced displacement in Gaza City**\nThe Gaza Media Office confirmed on Saturday 20 September that more than 900,000 Palestinians in Gaza City and the north of the Gaza Strip are standing firm and refusing to move south, where conditions for evacuation are extreme, citing a lack of water, food, safe health services and shelter. The office reported that 270,000 Gazans were forced to abandon their homes during Israel\u2019s mass displacement campaigns. It highlighted that the areas of Al\u2011Mawasi (in the Khan Younis governorate) and Rafah, promoted by Israel as \"humanitarian safe zones\", were bombed more than 110 times, resulting in over 2,000 registered deaths and countless bodies trapped under rubble. By noon on 20 September, more than 22,000 Gazans had returned from these southern areas to their original neighborhoods in Gaza City after finding basic conditions impossible to establish. Israel has designated only 12\u202f% of Gaza\u2019s total area as safe zones, attempting to force more than 1.7\u202fmillion people into them, a strategy the Gaza government calls \"concentration camps\" aimed at depopulating Gaza City and the north. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) estimated that a single family must spend approximately $3,180 to flee the bombardments, breaking down to $1,000 for a taxi, $2,000 for a family tent and $180 for a plot of land. UNRWA urged the international community to provide aid to ease the growing financial and humanitarian pressures on displaced families. The article also describes Israeli demolition operations, drone bombings, and the use of unmanned vehicles loaded with explosives in residential neighborhoods, labeling these actions as war crimes and ethnic cleansing. The narrative frames the situation as a genocide and a permanent forced displacement crime, presenting the Palestinian perspective on the ongoing conflict.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 01:33 AM\nSource:[teleSURtv.net](https://www.telesurtv.net/mas-900000-palestinos-resisten-desplazar-gaza/)\n\n**Netanyahu: Rafah Crossing Could Be Opened for Palestinians but Egypt Will Close It Immediately**\nThe article reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could \"open the Rafah crossing for Palestinians, but Egypt would close it immediately,\" in a statement to the Arabic outlet Al\u2011Quds Al\u2011Arabi.

Israel has killed nearly 62,700 Palestinians in Gaza since October\u202f2023, and the enclave faces famine. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and Israel faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[Yeni \u015eafak](https://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/relocation-of-13m-gazans-to-south-almost-impossible-authorities-warn-3706926)\n\n**Israel's Plan to Relocate 2 Million Palestinians to a Closed Area in Gaza Sparks Outrage**\nIsraeli Defense Minister Kats has unveiled a plan to relocate 2 million Palestinians from Gaza to a closed area in southern Gaza during a potential 60-day ceasefire agreement with Hamas. The plan, announced last Monday, aims to establish a closed area in southern Gaza to accommodate approximately 600,000 displaced people from Gaza, including four aid distribution points managed by international organizations. Eventually, all 2 million civilians in Gaza will be relocated there. Critics have raised concerns about the plan's feasibility and morality, with Israeli opposition leaders pointing out its high costs and an expert noting the lack of infrastructure to accommodate such a large number of refugees. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has described the proposed facilities as 'concentration camps', while the UK's Middle East and North Africa Minister expressed shock at the idea. 'Palestinian territory cannot be diminished,' UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said on X. 'Civilians must be able to return to their communities.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: July 13, 2025 10:33 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E4%B8%AD%E6%9D%B1/20250713-%E4%BB%A5%E8%89%B2%E5%88%97%E5%9C%8B%E9%98%B2%E9%83%A8%E9%95%B7%E8%A6%81%E6%8A%8A200%E8%90%AC%E5%8A%A0%E6%B2%99%E8%80%81%E7%99%BE%E5%A7%93%E5%AE%89%E7%BD%AE%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%B0%81%E9%96%89%E5%8D%80%EF%BC%8C%E8%81%AF%E5%90%88%E5%9C%8B%E8%AA%AA%E9%80%99%E6%98%AF%E9%9B%86%E4%B8%AD%E7%87%9F)\n\n**Israeli plan to move Gazans into closed zone triggers backlash**\nIsrael's proposal to relocate the entire civilian population of Gaza, over 2 million people, into a 'humanitarian city' in southern Gaza has been met with intense criticism. Critics argue that the plan is a costly distraction, a potential step towards forcing Palestinians off their land, and a 'concentration camp'. The plan, which would initially house 600,000 displaced people, has been described as 'extremist delusions' by opposition leader Yair Lapid. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has also condemned the plan, saying it would 'de-facto create massive concentration camps at the border with Egypt'. Amnesty International has warned that relocating Gazans within the territory or deporting them outside against their will would amount to the war crime of unlawful transfer. The projected expense of the initiative, estimated between 10 and 20 billion shekels ($3\u20136 billion), has further fuelled domestic outrage. 'That money is not coming back,' Lapid said. 'Netanyahu is letting Smotrich and Ben Gvir run wild with extremist delusions just to preserve his coalition.' - 'Civilians must be able to return to their communities,' said Britain's minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Hamish Falconer. 'Palestinian territory must not be reduced.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 13, 2025 05:51 PM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**Israel's Plan to Forcibly Relocate 2 Million Palestinians from Gaza Strip Sparks Controversy**\nIsrael's Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, has announced plans to forcibly relocate 2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to the southern city of Rafah, sparking controversy. According to Israeli daily Haaretz and British media The Guardian, Gallant instructed the military to prepare for the construction of an 'industrial city' in Rafah, where Palestinians would be resettled. The plan involves initially relocating 600,000 Palestinian refugees from the Al-Mawasi region, with the ultimate goal of relocating the entire 2 million population of the Gaza Strip. The settlement would be managed by international human rights organizations and guarded by the Israeli military. Gallant stated, 'Once Palestinians enter this area, they will not be able to leave freely, and we will simultaneously encourage those who wish to leave to do so in a third country.' The forced relocation of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip could be implemented if several conditions are met, including a ceasefire agreement and its actual implementation, according to Gallant. However, this plan has been criticized as a clear violation of international law and potentially a war crime. Israeli human rights lawyer Michael Sfard said, 'This is a plan to expel Palestinians from their homes, and it is a war crime.' He added, 'If this plan is carried out, it will be a war crime.' Israel has been embroiled in controversy over war crimes since it launched a war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in October 2023, using a strategy that fails to distinguish between civilians and combatants. The number of civilians killed in the bombing has exceeded 50,000, with most being women and children.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: July 08, 2025 04:34 AM\nSource:[\ub178\ucef7\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/6366189)\n\n**Voices from Gaza: Day 66**\nOn the 66th day of the war in Gaza, December 11, 2023, residents of Gaza City and northern Gaza express deep fear and anxiety amid continued Israeli military attacks. The occupation forces have imposed a strict siege, separating northern Gaza from central and southern areas by establishing roadblocks and conducting relentless military operations, including tank and missile strikes, in residential neighborhoods. Access to food, water, and medicine remains severely restricted. Displaced people in the south await the possibility of returning home, uncertain whether their homes still stand. Those remaining in Gaza City and the north face existential questions: Will they survive the ongoing bombardment? Where will they find basic necessities? When will they regain freedom of movement? A resident reflects on the term 'Arabs of 2023,' drawing a parallel to the 'Arabs of 1948' who became refugees after the Nakba. The author warns of a potential repetition of historical displacement, referencing past failed attempts to resettle Palestinians in the Sinai Peninsula, approved by Egypt\u2019s Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1953 but rejected by Palestinians. The article raises concerns that the current assault may lead to the creation of a Palestinian self-governing entity in Gaza under Israeli-American design, aimed at eliminating future resistance. This scenario is seen as increasingly likely, particularly given the disproportionate targeting of children\u201445% of the dead and a similar or higher proportion among the wounded\u2014whose bodies are severely maimed. The central question remains: Who will become the 'Arabs of 2023'?\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 20, 2023 06:12 PM\nSource:[bocchescucite.org](https://bocchescucite.org/voci-da-gaza-giorno-66/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts, from diverse disciplines including humanitarian operations, international law, conflict early warning, political science, migration studies, and Middle East studies, strongly agree that the probability of over 500,000 Palestinians being displaced from Gaza to outside the territory (especially into Egypt) before December 31st, 2025 is extremely low. The consensus is grounded in several converging assessments: \n\n1. While internal displacement within Gaza is catastrophic (over 1.7 million), actual documented cross-border movement remains extremely limited\u2014primarily highly controlled medical evacuations numbering thousands, not hundreds of thousands. \n2. Egypt has shown unwavering and forceful opposition to any mass influx of Palestinians, considering it a red line for national security and regional stability; this is reinforced by regional actors, the Arab League, and explicit diplomatic commitments (such as the Sharm El Sheikh Declaration). Military and logistical barriers are cited as formidable.\n3. While there is rhetoric and some contingency planning in Israel for external displacement of Gazans, practical implementation has been blocked by intense international legal, political, and diplomatic constraints, as well as Egypt's refusal.\n4. The international community (including the US, EU, UN, and Arab world) not only opposes but actively seeks to prevent forced mass displacement, framing it as a war crime with severe repercussions (e.g., ICJ/ICC scrutiny).\n5. All experts note that even extremely severe push factors (destruction, famine, inhuman living conditions) do not translate to mass cross-border movement when exit routes are politically and physically blocked.\n6. Historical base rates matter: even in the worst regional wars since 1948, such a large exodus has never happened from Gaza to Egypt or elsewhere. The present conditions, despite being apocalyptic, have not changed this reality.\n7. Experts allow for very low-probability 'black swan' scenarios (total collapse, regime change, unprecedented escalation), but see no concrete indicators in the current situation supporting such a risk in the short timeframe left. \n\nProbabilities across experts range from 2% to 5%, with key differences largely in emphasis on theoretical low-probability triggers. All concrete factors\u2014Egyptian and regional policy, international pressure, logistical realities, historical precedent, and on-the-ground data\u2014lead to the same forecast. The group chat did not reveal any material disagreement: all see the likelihood of 500,000+ Palestinians being displaced out of Gaza before December 31, 2025 as extraordinarily low barring a truly catastrophic, presently unforeseen development.",
