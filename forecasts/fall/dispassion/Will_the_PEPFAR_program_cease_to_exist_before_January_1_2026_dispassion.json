Courts have been inconsistent, with the Supreme Court recently allowing the administration to continue withholding funds. Congressional resistance has been weak, and much of PEPFAR\u2019s implementing infrastructure has already been gutted. However, the program has not been formally abolished by law, and some activities are still ongoing under the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy. The resolution criteria are strict: PEPFAR must cease to exist as a distinct program, not merely be reduced or partially defunded, before January 1, 2026. The most likely scenario is that, while PEPFAR is severely crippled and starved of funds, some vestigial form persists at least until the end of the year\u2014pending further court decisions or congressional action. The window for a final, unambiguous termination before January 1, 2026 is now very short, and the administrative and legal complexity of fully terminating a congressionally authorized program makes outright abolition difficult on this timeline.

The administration has attempted to terminate or starve the program via executive action and OMB impoundment, but courts have at times intervened, and the Supreme Court has not definitively settled the matter. Administrative absorption into the State Department has occurred for some functions, but reporting as of late November 2025 indicates PEPFAR is still recognized as a program, albeit crippled. The FY 2026 budget request proposes deep cuts, but Congress has not enacted them, and the timeline to January 1, 2026 is short. The base rate for full legal extinction of a major global health program within a year is very low. While the probability is higher than historical norms due to extreme executive action, the legal and appropriations framework makes a Yes resolution by January 1, 2026 unlikely unless a definitive administrative or legal act occurs in the next month.

The administration's FY 2026 budget cuts and the shift to a new aid model reinforce this. However, the legal bar for full program termination remains high; courts have at times blocked the most aggressive executive actions, and the definition of 'ceasing to exist' under the resolution criteria is strict: partial funding or program reduction is not enough. As of late November 2025, PEPFAR appears to be continuing in a truncated, waiver-driven, or administratively hobbled form, not yet formally terminated, merged, or defunded in entirety. With only about a month left to the resolution date, the window for a discrete, sustained action that would legally end PEPFAR by these criteria is rapidly closing. Given the severe damage but incomplete legal termination, the highest probability remains that PEPFAR will technically continue to exist in some form on Jan 1, 2026, even if operationally crippled. However, the risk of last-minute executive or Congressional action is much higher than in any historical base rate.

The current trajectory\u2014dissolution of implementing agencies, mass layoffs, and funding rescissions\u2014makes total cessation plausible, but the persistence of some funding, bureaucratic resistance, and the historical rarity of total elimination of flagship programs are important counterweights.

The forecast leans heavily on the legal and procedural inertia that historically protects such programs, but the recent Supreme Court emergency orders, ongoing executive actions, and the dissolution of USAID represent an escalation that erodes these safeguards. The administration's use of pocket rescission and impoundment\u2014plus the fact that courts have not provided durable, timely relief\u2014shows that the executive can create sustained, de facto program cessation even without formal repeal. This dynamic, coupled with a severely weakened congressional response and the absorption of PEPFAR administration into the State Department, means that the base rate for full program extinction is less relevant than in previous eras. Thus, while the probability estimate is well below 50% and recognizes historical patterns, it may be too conservative given the extraordinary context and the potential for a sudden, unblocked executive order or merger to tip the legal standard for cessation in the final month."

The administrative absorption and operational near-paralysis of PEPFAR are unprecedented, but the technical requirements for 'ceases to exist' (including a sustained, unblocked executive order or clear legal merger/termination) are high bars that have not yet been cleared. The PET argument may underplay the friction and delays endemic to large-scale federal program termination, especially amid ongoing litigation and congressional carve-outs.

Their identification of the historical base rate for program elimination as 'very low' is methodologically sound, and their recognition that severe curtailment does not meet the strict Metaculus resolution criteria is critical. This approach also benefits from a nuanced appreciation of both the domestic (congressional inertia, political risk) and international (reputation, bilateral relationships) constraints that make outright abolition unlikely in the short time remaining. Overall, this is a well-calibrated, status-quo-weighted argument that aligns closely with established patterns in US policy process research."

Their argument appropriately highlights the importance of waivers, ongoing (if partial) funding, and unresolved litigation in sustaining PEPFAR's existence as a distinct program. Critically, they recognize the historical rarity of outright elimination of such flagship programs and the inertia that protects them, even under hostile administrations. The probability offered (20%) is judicious: it accounts for the elevated risk due to severe executive disruption, but it rightly gives significant weight to the status quo and legal complexity.

By noting that PEPFAR is 'continuing in a truncated, waiver-driven, or administratively hobbled form, not yet formally terminated, merged, or defunded in entirety,' the forecaster aligns with Punctuated Equilibrium Theory's insight that even amid extreme disruption, institutional and legal legacies can preserve a program's nominal existence. The assessment properly recognizes the severe threats to continuity but tempers this with the reality that, in the absence of a clear legal/administrative action meeting the threshold, technical extinction is unlikely within the narrow timeframe remaining. Their probability (30%) is well-calibrated, higher than historic base rates but appropriately less than even odds, reflecting both the elevated volatility and the stubborn resilience of established federal programs. This balance is a strength, and the reasoning is compelling from both a policy process and PET perspective."

Their argument is especially strong in highlighting the inertia of bureaucracy, the entrenched bipartisan support for PEPFAR, and the very short window (just over a month) left for any full legal, administrative, or congressional extinction to occur.

The forecaster does an excellent job weighing the extreme disruption against the strict resolution criteria, noting that partial or even near-total operational collapse does not meet the bar for 'cease to exist' under Metaculus's rules. The probability (30%) is well-calibrated: higher than historical base rates due to the unprecedented context, but not overstated, given the short time remaining and the inertia typical of U.S. federal programs. The scenario analysis is especially compelling in articulating how a last-minute executive or congressional action could tip the scale, yet remains unlikely.

The forecaster insightfully notes that, despite unprecedented executive disruption, the final legal or administrative actions needed to satisfy the Metaculus resolution criteria have not yet occurred, and that ongoing litigation and congressional carve-outs are significant brakes on outright elimination. The probability (15%) is a clear reflection of this: it is higher than any historic norm, recognizing the crisis, but still emphasizes the resilience of statutory programs and the improbability of a clean, decisive termination event in the remaining four weeks.

The Trump administration\u2019s demonstrated willingness to dissolve USAID, impound funds via pocket rescission, and reassign or absorb programmatic functions into the State Department\u2014combined with a Supreme Court increasingly deferential to executive authority\u2014means that the legal and procedural safeguards protecting such programs are weaker than historical precedent would suggest. The forecast could give more weight to the potential for a rapid, unblocked executive action or a bureaucratic consolidation that, while not matching previous base rates, could meet the technical bar for 'ceases to exist' under the question's fine print, especially if legal challenges stall or are denied in the short window left.

The forecaster captures the reality that, although PEPFAR is operationally devastated\u2014funding halted, staff laid off, services slashed\u2014the program's statutory and bureaucratic identity persists. This distinction is crucial: in practice, African governments have seen donor programs wither or become nonfunctional while still existing on paper, and this gap between practical impact and legal existence is central to the group\u2019s reasoning. The scenario analysis also wisely notes how the likelihood of a sudden administrative or legal act that would fully terminate PEPFAR remains elevated but not dominant, especially given the short timeline and residual congressional carve-outs. The probability (30%) is a well-calibrated reflection of both the extreme threat environment and the inertia typical of U.S. foreign aid bureaucracy.

The highest outlier probabilities (in the 35-40% range) are based on the plausible risk of a late executive maneuver, but even these forecasters note that the strict legal criteria have not been satisfied and time is now extremely short.

In 2024 PEPFAR [received](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/pepfars-short-term-reauthorization-sets-an-uncertain-course-for-its-long-term-future/) temporary reauthorization from Congress amid the increasing opposition.

Concerns among anti-abortion members of Congress that PEPFAR has funded abortions in countries such as Mozambique, which has fueled speculation that PEPFAR may not have funding reauthorization and/or potentially could face budget cuts.\n2. Strong opposition to PEPFAR from the Trump Administration, including the loss of thousands of aid worker jobs since Trump's inauguration.\n3. The potential dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was implementing many of PEPFAR's programs.&#x20;\n4. Revival of the Mexico City policy by the Trump Administration, which requires no direct or indirect funding of abortions by non-governmental organizations and [includes PEPFAR](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-mexico-city-policy-an-explainer/) in its new policy.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":35481,\"question_id\":34948}}`",

The report states that persistent funding shortfalls have pushed the global HIV response into 'crisis mode,' particularly after the United States\u2014accounting for 75% of international HIV funding\u2014temporarily halted all HIV-related funding earlier in 2025. Although some programs have resumed through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), overall funding continues to decline. As of October 2025, an estimated 2.5 million people lost access to PrEP, a key HIV prevention medication. In Nigeria, male condom distribution dropped by 55% from December 2024 to March 2025. A survey by the ATHENA Network and UNAIDS found that nearly half of women and adolescent girls reported disruptions to HIV services. Despite a 54% decline in AIDS-related deaths (from 1.4 million in 2010 to 630,000 in 2024) and a 54% drop in new infections, the progress is under threat as current funding levels jeopardize the 2030 target to end AIDS as a public health threat.

The withdrawal halted or significantly reduced critical programs in food security, education, HIV/AIDS care, youth employment, and government services. By October 2025, Mozambique accounted for 11% of global ISIS-linked violence, with 79% of the group\u2019s global activity recorded in Africa between January and October. On September 7, 2025, ISIS attacked Mocimboa da Praia, beheading dozens of mostly Christian men and forcing thousands to flee.

Despite its initial high visibility and mandate to radically reduce federal spending, staff, and programs, Doge's operational independence has eroded, with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Kupor confirming that the department no longer exists as a centralized entity. Responsibilities were gradually absorbed by OPM and the Office of Management and Budget, which now institutionalize Doge\u2019s structural changes. Doge\u2019s tenure was marked by controversial actions: over 200,000 federal workers were laid off, and approximately 75,000 accepted buyouts, with internal claims of $214 billion in savings\u2014figures disputed by analysts due to lack of transparency and verifiable accounting. The shutdown of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) led to severe global health consequences, with epidemiologist Brooke Nichols estimating over 600,000 excess deaths linked to the loss of malaria prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, and vaccine programs. Internal uncertainty grew after Elon Musk\u2019s 130-day contract ended on May 30, 2025, and staff reportedly packed up personal belongings from headquarters. Musk, who once held up a chainsaw at CPAC to symbolize his anti-bureaucracy mission, has since distanced himself from the operation.

States like Idaho and Florida have launched their own Doge-style efficiency offices. While Doge\u2019s direct operations have ceased, its legacy persists through ongoing deregulation, AI-driven regulatory review, and visual modernization of government websites.

Promoted as a revolutionary efficiency initiative aimed at eliminating $2 trillion in government waste, DOGE lasted only months\u2014far short of its intended two-year mandate. According to Scott Kupor, Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), DOGE\u2019s functions have been absorbed by traditional federal agencies. Independent analysts and a damning Senate report indicate that DOGE cost more than it saved, with only $16.3 billion in verified savings\u2014far below its initial promises. The project caused widespread institutional chaos, including the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which critics link to approximately 638,000 preventable deaths globally due to halted humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Domestically, the Department of Education was weakened, and national cybersecurity was compromised by mass layoffs of experts, exposing sensitive federal data. DOGE also granted access to AI systems to federal databases, increasing cyber vulnerabilities. Elon Musk, who left in May after a public falling out with Trump, treated government operations as a personal toy; his surreal exit event, featuring an eye injury, underscored the administration\u2019s amateurism. Musk\u2019s popularity and Tesla\u2019s stock suffered as a result. Former DOGE staff now fear legal consequences, with some relocating to the new 'National Design Studio'\u2014a Trump-backed AI-driven redesign initiative led by an Airbnb co-founder.

However, Scott Cooper, the head of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and current leader of DOGE, denied the report, stating that DOGE had merely ceased having a 'centralized leadership' structure. On the same day, Cooper had previously claimed DOGE 'no longer exists' and that its functions had been absorbed by the Office of Personnel Management, which is seen as evidence of its dissolution. The DOGE was established on January 20, 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a 18-month advisory committee led by billionaire Elon Musk, with the goal of drastically cutting federal spending and restoring government efficiency. The committee was originally scheduled to end on July 4, 2026. After Musk's appointment, DOGE initiated large-scale federal employee layoffs and budget cuts, drawing widespread criticism. On May 28, 2025, Musk announced his departure from DOGE, leading to a public rift with Trump over the 'Big and Beautiful' (B&B) bill. Their relationship has since partially reconciled.

The plan aims to fulfill Trump\u2019s pledge to provide a better alternative to the enhanced ACA subsidies, which currently support approximately 22 million people. This comes after Democrats rejected efforts to reopen the government, which had been shut down for over a month, demanding a clear extension of these payments. Republican senators approved a mid-December vote to extend the enhanced subsidies until the end of the year, in exchange for extending government funding through January, prompting Trump and his team to develop their competing proposal. The enhanced subsidies were originally introduced in 2021 as part of the Biden administration\u2019s COVID-19 relief package. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a nonpartisan health policy research group, without the subsidies, insurance premiums are expected to more than double next year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that an additional two million people could become uninsured. Democrats are already preparing to use these anticipated consequences against the Republican Party in the upcoming midterm elections, hoping to replicate the 2018 midterm outcome when Republicans lost partial control of the House due to their prior efforts to repeal the ACA. A White House official stated that Trump must personally announce the plan, and until then, all reports about the administration\u2019s healthcare stance are speculative. The proposal is likely to include a mechanism allowing some enrollees in lower-tier insurance plans to redirect federal aid into health savings accounts. Trump has repeatedly called for a system that channels federal funds directly to individuals to help them purchase coverage, rather than funneling money to insurance companies through the current support program.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5317882)\n\n**U.S. Government Efficiency Department: No Early Dissolution, Official Denies Media Claims**\nAccording to the Xinhua News Agency, Scott Cooper, Administrator of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, denied on November 24, 2025, via social media that the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency had been dissolved eight months early, calling the report 'a sensational headline' created by media that misrepresented his words.

Doge\u2019s tenure was marked by controversial actions: over 200,000 federal workers were laid off, and approximately 75,000 accepted buyouts, with internal claims of $214 billion in savings\u2014figures disputed by analysts due to lack of transparency and verifiable accounting. The shutdown of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) led to severe global health consequences, with epidemiologist Brooke Nichols estimating over 600,000 excess deaths linked to the loss of malaria prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, and vaccine programs. Internal uncertainty grew after Elon Musk\u2019s 130-day contract ended on May 30, 2025, and staff reportedly packed up personal belongings from headquarters. Musk, who once held up a chainsaw at CPAC to symbolize his anti-bureaucracy mission, has since distanced himself from the operation. Former Doge officials transitioned into new roles across federal agencies\u2014Amy Gleason at HHS, Zachary Terrell as CTO at HHS, Rachel Riley at the Office of Naval Research, Jeremy Lewin at the State Department, Scott Langmack in HUD\u2019s AI initiatives, and Joe Gebbia leading the National Design Studio for federal web redesign. States like Idaho and Florida have launched their own Doge-style efficiency offices. While Doge\u2019s direct operations have ceased, its legacy persists through ongoing deregulation, AI-driven regulatory review, and visual modernization of government websites. The White House maintains that Trump continues to deliver on his mandate to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, though critics argue the initiative caused lasting harm to public services.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 05:29 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/trump-doge-shutdown-musk-what-really-happened-13953470.html)\n\n**Collapse of U.S. Aid Fuels Resurgence of ISIS in Mozambique Amid Escalating Crisis**\nThe collapse of U.S. aid programs, following the executive order by former President Donald Trump to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in January 2025, has significantly contributed to the resurgence of ISIS's 'Central Africa Province' in Mozambique. The withdrawal of aid\u2014amounting to $586 million in 2024, or roughly 3% of Mozambique\u2019s GDP\u2014disrupted critical programs including emergency food, clean water, education, local governance support, and HIV medication funding (partially $160 million). This abrupt funding halt, which affected $2.4 billion in ongoing or planned projects, created a vacuum that enabled militants to expand their influence. According to ACLED data, 79% of global ISIS activity from January to October 2025 occurred in Africa, with Mozambique accounting for 11% of global violence linked to the group in October. In Mocimboa da Praia, ISIS militants reasserted control, executing at least eight men\u2014seven decapitated\u2014prompting over 90,000 people to flee. Former USAID officials stated that the sudden cessation of programs removed vital social and economic safeguards, exacerbating poverty, despair, and marginalization\u2014key drivers of insurgency. With humanitarian workers leaving, aid offices closing, and UN funding reduced from $352 million to $126 million (with only $73.2 million received, $3.5 million from the U.S.), camps like Lianda now offer only one month of emergency aid. Despite the security crisis, major LNG projects by TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil continue near conflict zones, supported by a $4.7 billion EXIM Bank loan, raising concerns over development in unstable regions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[al-ain.com](https://al-ain.com/article/isis-terrorism-poverty-us-aid-mozambique)\n\n**The Monthslong Legal Battle to Save Foreign Aid**\nA nearly nine-month-long legal battle over President Donald Trump's attempt to cut $4 billion in foreign aid funding\u2014appropriated by Congress under President Joe Biden\u2014has repeatedly reached the Supreme Court, with the case reviewed by 21 judges and generating thousands of pages of filings. The lawsuit, filed by the Global Health Council, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, and other nonprofits, challenged Trump\u2019s blanket suspension of foreign aid, which disrupted humanitarian missions, halted supply chains, and led to rotting food and expired medicine abroad. In February 2025, Judge Amir H. Ali ruled the freeze likely unlawful and ordered the release of $2 billion in back payments. The Supreme Court initially upheld this, blocking the freeze. However, the administration dissolved USAID, cut over 80% of its programs\u2014including PEPFAR\u2014and invoked a controversial 'pocket rescission' to bypass Congress, claiming constitutional authority to impound funds. In August, a D.C. Circuit panel ruled only the comptroller general could sue on Congress\u2019s behalf, stalling the case. The Supreme Court then, on September 26, 2025, issued a preliminary emergency order blocking Judge Ali\u2019s $10 billion disbursement order, allowing the funds to remain frozen. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, calling the decision 'uncharted territory' and warning of catastrophic global harm. Despite lower court rulings in favor of the aid groups, the administration has continued to withhold funds, with Congress offering no resistance. Lawyers like Stephen K. Wirth argue the case is less about foreign policy and more about asserting executive power over Congress. The legal dispute remains unresolved, with the damage to global health and development efforts already substantial.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/twisted-path-foreign-aid-court-case.html)\n\n**The Trump Administration's Foreign Aid Review: Status of PEPFAR | KFF**\nThe Trump administration's foreign aid review, initiated on the first day of its second term, has significantly disrupted U.S. global health programs, particularly the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Executive actions included a 90-day foreign aid review, a stop-work order freezing all payments and services, the dissolution of USAID (including the reduction of most staff and contractors), and the cancellation of most foreign assistance awards. Although a limited waiver issued on February 1, 2025, allowed continuation of 'life-saving HIV services'\u2014specifically HIV treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and HIV testing\u2014other critical services like PrEP for non-pregnant individuals and programming for orphans and vulnerable children were prohibited. The stop-work order halted antiretroviral therapy and forced implementers to lay off thousands of staff. Of 770 global health awards identified, 86% were canceled, including 71% of HIV-related awards. Legal challenges have yielded limited success: a preliminary injunction was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on standing grounds, and the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the government\u2019s right to withhold funds. USAID was permanently dissolved and its functions absorbed into the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy (GHSD), while CDC staffing reductions threaten further implementation capacity. Despite the FY 2025 Continuing Resolution providing $4.85 billion in level funding for PEPFAR, the administration\u2019s FY 2026 budget request proposes only $2.9 billion\u2014a $1.9 billion reduction. The administration announced a partnership with the Global Fund to deliver long-acting injectable PrEP to up to 2 million people by 2028, continuing a Biden-era initiative. The September 2025 'America First Global Health Strategy' reorients global health priorities toward U.S. national interests. Reports confirm severe impacts: 71% of PEPFAR partners canceled at least one activity, 50% reported staff reductions, and only 14% could sustain operations beyond one month without funding. UNAIDS documented loss of thousands of HIV health workers in Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Angola, Eswatini, and Ukraine. WHO assessments found moderate to severe disruptions in HIV services across nearly half of surveyed countries. Modeling studies project that ending PEPFAR funding could lead to 565,000 new HIV infections and a 3.71-year reduction in life expectancy for people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa over a decade.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 04:08 PM\nSource:[KFF](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-pepfar/)\n\n**The Trump Administration's Foreign Aid Review: Reorganization of U.S. Global Health Programs | KFF**\nStarting on the first day of his second term, President Trump issued a series of executive actions that fundamentally restructured U.S. foreign assistance, including a 90-day review of foreign aid, a stop-work order freezing all payments and services for ongoing programs (except for limited life-saving services via waivers), the dissolution of USAID with the reduction of most staff and contractors, and the cancellation of 86% of USAID awards\u2014amounting to $12.7 billion in unobligated funding out of 770 global health awards identified. The stop-work order halted bilateral global health programming, forcing implementers to lay off thousands of staff and suspend services. Although waivers were issued for select life-saving services\u2014such as PEPFAR, TB, malaria, maternal and child health, nutrition, and infectious disease outbreak response\u2014access remained difficult and services stayed disrupted. The dissolution of USAID and proposed cuts to CDC have significantly reduced implementation capacity. Additional actions include the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, withdrawal from the World Health Organization, and a review of international organization participation. In September 2025, the administration released the 'America First Global Health Strategy,' focusing on HIV, TB, malaria, polio, and global health security under three pillars: making America safer, stronger, and more prosperous. The FY 2026 budget request proposes a $6.2 billion reduction in global health funding through foreign assistance, with a rescission package that initially sought to cut $400 million from PEPFAR and $500 million from other programs\u2014though Congress exempted PEPFAR, maternal and child health, TB, malaria, and nutrition from rescission, while allowing $500 million in family planning and other programs to be cut. Key uncertainties remain regarding program reorganization, leadership appointments (including the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and U.S. Malaria Coordinator), and the development of bilateral agreements to scale down funding. The future of U.S. global health efforts depends on these unresolved structural and financial decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[KFF](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-proposed-reorganization-of-u-s-global-health-programs/)\n\n**South Africa Celebrates U.S. Plan to Fund HIV Program**\nSouth Africa has celebrated the U.S. plan to fund the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has been credited with saving over 25 million lives from HIV over two decades, primarily in Africa. South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV globally. In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending all foreign aid to South Africa, including PEPFAR. Although a temporary 90-day exemption was granted, the U.S. began canceling grants by late February 2025, leaving most funds frozen or halted, resulting in job losses and disruptions to services. Previously, the U.S. provided over $400 million annually to HIV programs in South Africa and non-governmental organizations\u2014approximately 17% of total funding, according to the health department.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 12:37 PM\nSource:[jornada.com.mx](https://www.jornada.com.mx/noticia/2025/10/16/sociedad/sudafrica-celebra-plan-de-eu-para-financiar-programa-contra-el-vih)\n\n**This tiny nation was winning in its fight against HIV. Then Trump cut foreign aid**\nOn January 20, 2024, the first day of Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid, leading to the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This action severely disrupted HIV programs in Lesotho, a small southern African nation with one of the world\u2019s highest HIV infection rates. Prior to the cuts, nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid\u2014primarily through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\u2014had helped Lesotho achieve significant progress, including reaching UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal by late 2023. However, after the aid freeze, Lesotho lost at least 23% of its PEPFAR funding, resulting in the closure of clinics, layoffs of 1,500 health workers, and the suspension of HIV prevention programs targeting mother-to-child transmission, male circumcision, and high-risk groups. Patients began rationing medication, and health workers like Lisebo Lechela and Mapapali Mosoeunyane reported a collapse in services, with many fearing death due to interrupted treatment. Although the U.S. State Department announced in September 2024 a six-month bridge program to reinstate some lifesaving initiatives\u2014including testing, treatment, and a new long-acting HIV prevention shot\u2014implementation remains slow and uncertain. Lesotho, which funded only 12% of its health budget domestically, now faces a crisis in sustaining its HIV response. Health officials and experts warn that the cuts have set back progress by at least 15 years and risk reversing decades of gains, with UNAIDS warning up to 4 million global deaths could occur without restored funding. Despite some temporary relief, many in Lesotho feel betrayed and hopeless, with health workers and patients alike expressing despair over the loss of life-saving support. As of October 2025, no formal agreement has been secured, and hundreds of health workers remain unemployed despite verbal promises of absorption into the national system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 08:17 AM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/lesotho-hiv-aids-trump-africa-b2846428.html)\n\n**Trump administration's new global health aid strategy focuses on...**\nThe U.S. State Department announced on Thursday a shift in its foreign health assistance strategy to multiyear bilateral agreements with recipient countries, aiming to reduce waste and align aid with American interests. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, 'We must keep what is good about our health foreign assistance programs while rapidly fixing what is broken,' and added that the U.S. will remain the world\u2019s health leader but will do so in a way that directly benefits the American people and promotes national interest. The new approach follows President Trump\u2019s transactional style, building on his departure from traditional U.S. aid that he said had strayed from American values. The administration has already dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and cut billions of congressionally approved aid dollars, including a freeze that paused funding for the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26\u202fmillion lives. Under the new plan, countries will receive more \u2018skin in the game,\u2019 with aid tied to negotiations that encourage recipient governments to reduce dependence on U.S. assistance. The State Department said global health programs have become inefficient and wasteful, and will focus future dollars on drugs, diagnostic kits and frontline needs while shifting program management and technical assistance to recipient governments. The strategy will be negotiated over the next months, with new agreements expected by spring\u202f2026, and will keep supporting HIV\u2011stricken areas in Africa while redirecting more funding to partners in the Western Hemisphere and Asia\u2011Pacific. Funding will also move away from NGOs the administration views as mismanaging money.

The Trump administration dismantled USAID early this year, freezing foreign aid; the State Department later issued an exemption for life\u2011saving services, but many initiatives have still been terminated.  NGOs report shortages of medication, staff cuts, suspended community outreach, and rising stigma and mortality in countries such as Uganda, the Philippines and Tanzania.  M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res warned that \"PEPFAR faces an uncertain future\" and that the program\u2019s scope has \"decreased dramatically since January\".  World Vision\u2019s Kenyan program, which focused on orphaned children and prevention, was also cancelled.  Budget documents show that only about US$2.9\u202fbillion of the US$6\u202fbillion allocated for 2025 has been released, with the remainder listed as \"unassigned\" and tied to a spending plan yet to be approved.  Congressional aides and senators, including Susan Collins and Patty Murray, have criticized the Office of Management and Budget for blocking funds, arguing that the law requires all congressional appropriations to be used for PEPFAR\u2019s day\u2011to\u2011day work.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) disclosed that only about half of the $6\u202fbillion PEPFAR budget approved by Congress was spent this year, with the remaining billions carried over to the 2026 fiscal year.  Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the law is clear but the money is not reaching the field, adding that such delays will cause \"unnecessary deaths.\"  Republican Senator Susan Collins echoed the concern, noting that \"PEPFAR funds are blocked and patients are not receiving care.\"  President Trump separately announced the cancellation of $4.9\u202fbillion in overseas aid that had already been approved, provoking backlash from both parties.  A federal judge recently ruled that the administration cannot suspend foreign aid without congressional approval, yet the White House is seeking a Supreme Court review.

The order cited that the 'U.S. foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and, in many cases, are antithetical to American values.' The move led to mass layoffs, closure of the Washington,\u202fD.C. headquarters, and termination of thousands of contracts. By July\u202f1,\u202f2025 Rubio announced that 83\u202f% of USAID\u2019s programs\u2014worth $75\u202fbillion\u2014had been eliminated, leaving only 1,000 programs under State Department oversight. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and international organizations, called the action illegal, arguing that agency creation and elimination normally require congressional approval; courts, including the Supreme Court, largely agreed, with a judge ruling the administration likely violated the Constitution by withholding congressionally funded aid. The shutdown removed over 40\u202f% of global foreign aid, abruptly halting programs such as the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which had saved more than 25\u202fmillion lives, and stopping medicine distribution and clinic operations. Conservation initiatives and environmental protection efforts were also halted. A Lancet report estimates that the cuts could lead to 14\u202fmillion deaths worldwide by 2030, including 4.5\u202fmillion children under five. In Kenya, the freeze caused layoffs, crippled health programs, and left vulnerable communities in crisis. Rubio defended the move by citing $165\u202fbillion spent on aid that 'failed to align with American interests at the United Nations' and corruption among NGOs, while critics warned that the withdrawal amounts to a death sentence for millions in developing nations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 10:48 AM\nSource:[kdrtv.co.ke](https://www.kdrtv.co.ke/news/trumps-usaid-cuts-could-kill-14-million-globally-study-warns-a-humanitarian-disaster-on-pandemic-scale/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that PEPFAR, while facing unprecedented threats in 2025\u2014from aggressive executive actions (such as the dissolution of USAID, funding freezes, and administrative efforts to merge or terminate the program) and operational chaos\u2014has not been legally terminated, fully defunded, or decisively merged into another entity as of late November 2025. Across perspectives in U.S. government affairs, international aid management, political science, public health, and African studies, forecasters highlight several factors: (1) The Trump administration's open hostility to global health aid has sharply increased risk to PEPFAR's existence, with structural changes making termination increasingly plausible; (2) Congressional appropriations, inertia, and scattered bipartisan support remain partial bulwarks, with Congress continuing to provide some funding and resisting complete rescission or legal termination; (3) Judicial interventions have slowed, blocked, or muddied the most aggressive executive actions, and no court has thus far allowed uncontested administrative elimination for the required 60 days; (4) Bureaucratic inertia, international backlash, and the technical nuances of program cessation (strictly defined by the question) make outright legal extinction within a month highly challenging; (5) The historical base rate for full U.S. flagship aid program termination within a single budget cycle is near zero. \n\nAlthough the window for definitive action before January 1, 2026, is nearly closed, the risk of rapid, disruptive change is higher than ever, but experts universally judge that the most likely scenario is a severely weakened, partially operational, but still legally distinct and funded PEPFAR crossing into the next year. Forecasters' probabilities for PEPFAR ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, cluster between 11% and 40%, with most in the 12\u201330% range. The consensus view is that, barring an unexpected, decisive legal act or executive action surviving judicial challenge for 60 days within the remaining period, PEPFAR will technically survive into 2026.",
