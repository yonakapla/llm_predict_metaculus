To resolve 'Yes,' the 2025 figure must be \u226426.91%. Demographic decline, policy shocks (OBBBA, immigration), and cultural shifts (trades, AI-driven skepticism) all reinforce the trend downward. The news confirms that international enrollment is dropping, financial aid is being cut, and more students are pursuing alternatives to 4-year college. However, the decline so far has been gradual (about 2-3 percentage points over 7 years). With only 2-3 more years elapsed, and considering institutional efforts to recruit and retain students, the most likely scenario is a further decline but not a sharp one\u2014likely landing just above the 'Yes' threshold (i.e., in the 27.0-27.5% range). The risk of a sharper drop is nontrivial due to the confluence of negative factors, but the status quo of gradualism should be given extra weight. Therefore, I assess a moderately high probability that the threshold is not crossed, but with significant risk.

While there's a non-trivial chance that adaptation, lag effects, or alternate recruitment (older students, retooling) keep the decline under 10%, the weight of evidence favors a significant drop\u2014especially given the abrupt policy and demographic shifts peaking in 2025. Given all factors, I judge the probability that the fraction of American 18-24 year-olds enrolled in college in 2025 is at least 10% less than in 2015 (i.e., 26.91% or lower) to be around 75%.",

Furthermore, the denominator (total 18-24 population) is shrinking, which can mask declines in the numerator (enrolled students) and make percentage-based drops less dramatic than raw numbers suggest.

Thus, while I recognize slightly increased downside risk, I do not see sufficient new evidence to justify revising my probability upward or downward. I will maintain my original estimate.",

While my initial argument accounted for a convergence of historic negative shocks, the strongest counterpoint is the evidence that even large policy and economic disruptions often result in gradual, not abrupt, enrollment changes. The denominator (18-24 year-olds) is shrinking, but the numerator's rate of decline is not guaranteed to accelerate sharply enough in one or two years to cross the 10% threshold. The critique of the 'Economics (Labor Market Signaling)' forecaster is especially salient: negative impacts from the OBBBA Act and demographic cliff may take more than a single admissions cycle to fully manifest. While the probability remains elevated relative to historical norms, I now judge that the odds of breaching the 26.91% threshold in 2025 are somewhat lower than my initial estimate, warranting a downward adjustment, though it still leans Yes due to the unusual confluence of adverse factors.",

While my initial estimate was on the bold side to reflect the unprecedented simultaneity of shocks, I now see merit in slightly reducing my probability to better balance the base rate inertia with the acute negative drivers.

However, critiques emphasized that base rate inertia, stickiness of status attainment, and slow-moving societal change make sharp single-year declines historically rare. There is meaningful risk of a threshold-crossing drop, but odds above 60% seem to overstate the immediacy of these effects, while my original probability may have underweighted the magnitude of the 2024-25 policy shocks and the compounding effects.

The risk of a near-miss (e.g., rate landing just above 26.91%) is significant, and recent hard data suggest a gradual rather than precipitous decline.

The article claims that since the ruling, Black student representation at elite institutions like Harvard, Princeton, Caltech, and MIT has dropped significantly\u2014e.g., Black freshmen accounted for only about 2% at Caltech and Bates College. The AP cited Princeton sophomore Christopher Quire, who expressed shock at a sparsely attended Black freshman welcome event, saying, 'It feels like tying our feet together and telling us to restart.' In contrast, Preston Cooper of the American Enterprise Institute stated that the shift reflects a merit-based admissions system, noting, 'Americans think that colleges should not be taking into account race when they're making their admissions decisions.' The article further argues that affirmative action leads to higher dropout rates and lower academic performance among minority students, citing a Heritage Foundation analysis showing that over 50% of African-American law students admitted under such policies were in the bottom 10% of their class, with a dropout rate of 19.3% compared to 8.2% for white peers. The piece concludes with rhetorical questions challenging the logic of race-based hiring in sports and professions, suggesting that proponents of affirmative action should personally experience its consequences by using only minority professionals hired via such policies. The article is framed as a critique of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) agendas, portraying them as rooted in 'white guilt and emotional blackmail.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 04:53 PM\nSource:[The Western Journal](https://www.westernjournal.com/affirmative-action-ban-already-huge-impact-top-colleges-report/)\n\n**Brazil Regresses in Educational Inclusion Index and Remains at Pre-Pandemic Levels**\nAccording to the new data from the Educational Inclusion Index (IIE), produced by the organization Metas Sociais at the request of the Instituto Natura, only 15.5% of Brazilian youths born in 2006\u2014those who should have completed high school by 2023\u2014did so at the appropriate age (17 or 18 years old) with minimum desired proficiency in Portuguese and mathematics, as measured by the Basic Education Assessment System (Saeb).

The indicator shows a decline after the COVID-19 pandemic: it rose from 9.5% in 2015 to 18.9% in 2019, but dropped to 17% in 2021 and 15.5% in 2023 (the most recent available data). The percentage of students who graduate with adequate learning varies from 5.6% in Amap\u00e1 to 20.4% in Paran\u00e1. David Saad, president of Instituto Natura, emphasized that low learning levels are the main factor hindering improvement. He warned that students leaving school without sufficient learning face reduced access to higher education and better jobs. Despite improvements in Ideb, some states like Par\u00e1 show significant disparities: while Par\u00e1 rose to sixth place in Ideb for high school performance, it has the highest rate of students delayed by two or more years (46.5%) and one of the highest rates of youth outside school (10.6%), factors not captured by Ideb. The IEE is calculated biannually, aligning with the Saeb's schedule.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 03:11 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2025/10/so-15-dos-jovens-concluem-ensino-medio-na-idade-certa-e-com-aprendizado-esperado.shtml)\n\n**How One Big Beautiful Bill Act Threatens Student Success**\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed in July 2024, threatens student success by imposing significant cuts to federal support programs critical to college students' basic needs and financial stability. Nearly 60% of U.S. college students experience at least one form of basic needs insecurity, including food and housing instability. The bill includes $186 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), requiring all adults aged 18 to 64 to work at least 20 hours per week to qualify\u2014potentially cutting access for approximately one in four college students who face food insecurity. SNAP is vital for reducing hunger, supporting health, and boosting local economies, but its disruption may strain campus food pantries, which are largely privately funded. The bill also restricts Pell Grant eligibility: students with a Student Aid Index (SAI) above $14,790 and those whose scholarships cover full cost of attendance are no longer eligible, regardless of financial need. Experts warn this could disproportionately affect low-income and marginalized students. Additionally, the act caps graduate and professional degree loans at $200,000 and $100,000 respectively and eliminates Grad PLUS loans, which may reduce access to higher education for students at historically Black colleges and minority-serving institutions. These changes could lead to increased reliance on high-interest private loans and reduce enrollment and diversity in graduate programs. Policy leaders, including Bryce McKibben of the Hope Center and Jessica Thompson of the Institute for College Access and Success, express deep concern that these changes will exacerbate financial stress and threaten student persistence and degree completion. A 2025 Student Voice survey found 64% of students did not know whether their college offered emergency aid, and only 12% knew how to apply, underscoring systemic gaps in support infrastructure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 08:07 AM\nSource:[Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/health-wellness/2025/10/30/how-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-threatens-student)\n\n**Bashkortostan's College Student Population Exceeds University Enrollment**\nThe Republic of Bashkortostan has confirmed its status as a national leader in the scale of secondary professional education (SPoE), with the number of college students surpassing those in universities. According to regional education minister Ildar Mavletberdin, training is conducted across 170 specialties and 88 vocational professions. In 2025, 38,000 applicants enrolled in SPoE programs, with 66% of 9th-grade graduates choosing this path; the average competition ratio was 3 applicants per spot. The federal project 'Professionalitet' has been a key driver of development: since 2022, 19 colleges have been modernized, with 8 more planned for 2026, funded by 2.4 billion rubles from the federal budget and 1.3 billion from the republic. As a result, Bashkortostan leads Russia in the number of created education-production centers. Outcomes include an increase in the average admission score for vocational programs from 3.8 to 4.3 and a competition ratio of 4 applicants per spot. Targeted training has expanded significantly, rising from 637 contracts in 2022 to 4,307 in 2025. Monitoring of 'Professionalitet' graduates (involving 4 colleges) in 2025 showed 67% employed, 9% continuing education in universities, and 14% serving in the Russian Armed Forces; overall placement rate reached a record 91%. A special council under the republic's head synchronizes SPoE with economic needs. In the current academic year, 2,000 additional budget places were allocated, primarily in mechanical engineering, healthcare, and IT, meeting key enterprise workforce demands. Minister Mavletberdin emphasized that modern colleges have become agile platforms responding to labor market challenges, and the region\u2019s SPoE development strategy is the only correct path in the current context. Earlier, 'FederalPress' reported that Bashkortostan led the Volga Federal District in new individual entrepreneurs, registering over 20,800 in the first nine months of 2025, surpassing Tatarstan and Samara Oblast.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:09 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/community/55546424-v-bashkortostane-studentov-kolledzhey-stalo-bolshe-chem-studentov-vuzov/)\n\n**More overseas students propel early applications to record levels**\nThe number of early applications to UK universities for 2026 entry reached a record high of 79,160, a 7.4% increase from 73,720 in 2025, surpassing the previous peak of 77,810 in 2022.

Only 44% of regular AI users believe AI will limit their career opportunities, compared to 71% of those who have never used AI. Despite this, over half of young people (55%) view AI as a threat to their careers, and only 21% feel more excited than anxious about it. A stark gender gap exists: 30% of young men feel AI could help advance their careers, versus 13% of young women. While 72% of respondents believe AI education is at least somewhat important, 78% report that AI literacy is not taught in schools or is discouraged. Educators like David Marchick, dean of American University's Kogod School of Business, emphasize teaching skepticism and critical evaluation of AI early in academic programs. The study suggests that the AI knowledge gap may determine who benefits from AI and who is left behind.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/28/ai-optimism-gen-z-millennial-college)\n\n**Despite naysayers and rising costs, data show that college still pays off for students, and society overall**\nDespite significant challenges including federal funding cuts, restrictive immigration policies, and rising tuition costs under the second Trump administration, data from 2025 show that a college degree remains highly valuable for individuals and society. A September 2025 Gallup poll found that 75% of Americans rated college as 'very important' in 2010, compared to 35% in 2025, reflecting a growing skepticism. However, evidence indicates that college graduates earn significantly more: the average 2023 graduate earned $64,291 in 2024, up from $60,028 in 2023, while high school graduates earned a median of $46,100 in 2022. Lifetime earnings for college graduates exceed those of high school graduates by about $1.2 million. A major workforce gap is expected, with 18.4 million college-educated workers retiring by 2032, while only 13.8 million new college graduates are projected to enter the workforce, creating demand for 700,000 new college-degree-required jobs. Fields like nursing, teaching, engineering, and law will face shortages due to retirements. The State University of New York (SUNY) system returns $8.70 for every $1 invested in economic growth. The author argues that reforms such as integrating AI into curricula, prioritizing soft skills, expanding paid internships with academic credit, and offering microcredentials can increase enrollment and completion. These changes require state-level partnerships and long-term investment to ensure higher education continues to drive economic growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 05:05 PM\nSource:[Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2025-10-naysayers-college-pays-students-society.html)\n\n**Trans and nonbinary youth identities plummet by half, professor confirms**\nA San Diego State University psychology professor, Jean Twenge, confirmed findings from a University of Buckingham professor, Eric Kaufmann, that the number of young people identifying as transgender or nonbinary has declined significantly in the U.S. between 2022 and 2024. Kaufmann\u2019s analysis, based on the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) survey, indicated that nonbinary identification among college students dropped from 7% in 2023 to just under 4% in 2025, which he described as a 'free fall' in transgender identification. However, the FIRE survey did not specifically ask about transgender identity, raising concerns about data validity. Twenge analyzed the Cooperative Election Study (CES), which included direct questions on transgender and nonbinary identities from 2021 to 2024. Her analysis revealed that transgender identification among 18- to 22-year-olds dropped by half from 2022 to 2024, and nonbinary identification declined by over 50% between 2023 and 2024. Twenge concluded on her Substack that 'identifying as transgender really is in free fall among the young in the US. So is identifying as nonbinary,' affirming Kaufmann\u2019s conclusion despite concerns over the data source. She emphasized that a full analysis of 2025 CES data is needed to determine if the trend is sustained, and speculated that increased societal acceptance may be a contributing factor.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 05:05 PM\nSource:[WKRC](https://local12.com/news/nation-world/trans-and-nonbinary-youth-identities-plummet-by-half-confirms-sdsu-professor-gender)\n\n**Trans identity plummets among young Americans - study  --  RT World News**\nThe share of 18-24 year olds in the United States identifying as transgender has declined by approximately half since 2023, according to a study by politics professor Eric Kaufmann of the University of Buckingham. Kaufmann analyzed major U.S. surveys of high school and university students and found that the percentage of students identifying as 'not male or female' peaked at nearly 7% in 2023 and dropped to below 4% in 2025. The study also revealed a broader shift in sexual identity, with the proportion of non-heterosexual students decreasing by about ten percentage points, driven primarily by fewer young people identifying as queer, pansexual, or other non-heterosexual identities. Meanwhile, the share of heterosexual students rose to 77% in 2025, up from 68% in 2023. Kaufmann noted that younger students were less likely to identify as transgender or queer than older students, suggesting a cultural shift in identity trends. He emphasized that the decline in BTQ+ (bisexual, transgender, queer, and related) identification does not correlate with reduced social media use, religious revival, political conservatism, or lower support for progressive ideologies. Instead, Kaufmann attributes part of the trend to improved mental health among students post-Covid-19 pandemic. He described the shift as a 'momentous and unanticipated post-progressive cultural shift' following over a decade of rapid growth in gender and sexual diversity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 07:29 PM\nSource:[RT](https://www.rt.com/news/626495-us-trans-students-number-decline/)\n\n**Transgender Identity Numbers in Free Fall Among American Students: Study**\nA study analyzing polling data by Eric Kaufmann, a professor at the University of Buckingham and adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, suggests a nearly 50% decline in the number of college students identifying as transgender or nonbinary between 2023 and 2025. According to the report, the Andover Phillips Academy survey showed a drop from 9.2% to 3% of students identifying as neither male nor female, and Brown University saw a decline from 5% to 2.6% over two years. Kaufmann argues the trend indicates gender identity is 'going out of fashion,' citing that younger students are less likely to identify as transgender or queer than upperclassmen, suggesting shifting cultural fashions. However, the data is limited to university students and relies on a survey design that groups 'nonbinary' with 'transgender' identity, with no distinct option for transgender. Kaufmann himself acknowledged that a transgender person would likely select 'nonbinary'\u2014a claim unsupported by evidence. The article notes that prior research, such as the Williams Institute report (2022), found 1.4% of youth aged 13\u201317 and 1.3% of those aged 18\u201324 identified as transgender, a significant increase from earlier data. The author acknowledges the current study's limitations but suggests it may reflect a broader 'second thoughts' movement among youth re-evaluating identity, politics, and social norms, possibly influenced by post-pandemic societal changes. The article concludes with a speculative view that youth are re-examining foundational assumptions, not necessarily rejecting gender identity, and asserts that 'the kids will be alright.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 02:03 PM\nSource:[PJ Media](https://pjmedia.com/rick-moran/2025/10/15/transgender-identity-numbers-in-free-fall-among-american-students-study-n4944876)\n\n**As AI threatens white-collar work, more young Americans choose blue-collar careers**\nA growing number of young Americans are choosing blue-collar careers over college, driven by rising student loan debt, the perceived threat of artificial intelligence (AI) to white-collar jobs, and the pursuit of job security. Jacob Palmer, a 23-year-old electrician and business owner, launched his own electrical company in 2024 after completing an apprenticeship, reporting $90,000 in first-year revenue and projecting over $150,000 in 2025. According to a Jobber survey, 57% of Gen Z respondents cite student loan debt as a concern about college, and 77% prioritize jobs that are hard to automate\u2014favoring skilled trades like electricians, plumbers, welders, and HVAC technicians. In contrast, fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting are seen as more vulnerable to AI. The unemployment rate for college-educated 23-to-27-year-olds rose to 4.6% in 2025, up from 3.2% in 2019, while non-college-educated peers saw only a 0.5% increase. Experts like David Asay of Advantage Reline and Vinnie Curcie of OC Solar note a shift in perception: trades are now viewed as skilled, entrepreneurial, and secure. School districts like Mesa Public Schools report increased enrollment in welding, construction, and auto shop programs. Palmer and 18-year-old Kayden Evans, an intern at Empire Cat, both emphasize job security and independence, with Evans stating, 'AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 08:33 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/ai-artificial-intelligence-work-trade-jobs/)\n\n**Opinion | Gen Z men are facing a surprise workforce crisis**\nThe opinion piece argues that the steep decline in participation of young men (ages 16\u201124) in the U.S. labor market is largely driven by education and disability.

Only 45% of respondents are considered \u2018thriving\u2019\u2014meaning they rate their current lives positively and expect to continue doing so in five years. The decline is driven entirely by Gen\u202fZ adults: 39% of adult respondents report thriving, a five\u2011point drop from 2024, and only 37% of adult Gen\u202fZ women are thriving compared with 46% the previous year. In contrast, 56% of Gen\u202fZ middle and high\u2011school students report thriving, creating a 17\u2011percentage\u2011point gap between students and adults within the same generation. The survey also reports that Black Gen\u202fZ individuals are more likely to thrive than peers from other racial and ethnic backgrounds, that frequent attendance at religious services is associated with higher thriving rates, and that LGBTQ+ adults are significantly less likely to thrive. Students who do not plan to pursue higher education after graduation show lower classroom engagement across all eight measured elements compared with college\u2011bound peers. Despite adult wellbeing declines, every measure of classroom engagement reached record levels in 2025, with high\u2011school students showing notable improvements.

A new NFAP report warns of a \u2018demographic cliff\u2019 as the number of traditional college\u2011aged Americans is expected to fall sharply from 2025, potentially reducing undergraduate enrollment by nearly five million students by 2037 and graduate enrollment by over 1.1\u202fmillion. The loss of international students threatens the financial viability of many institutions, especially smaller, regional colleges that rely on their tuition for survival. Public colleges saw their largest decline in tuition revenue since 1980 in 2023, prompting cuts such as West\u202fVirginia\u202fUniversity\u2019s program closures and faculty layoffs. Immigration restrictions\u2014travel bans, limited visa interviews, reduced post\u2011graduation work options, and changes to the H\u20111B program\u2014have further compounded the problem. The article cites that in 2025 a controversial U.S. State Department decision forced international students to leave the country for minor visa violations, sparking criticism before being reversed. NAFSA predicts a substantial drop in new international enrollment for fall\u202f2025. The piece emphasizes that international students pay higher tuition, subsidizing U.S.\u2011born students, and that second\u2011generation Americans contribute significantly to campus diversity.

Colleges, companies, and cities are unprepared.**\nBusiness Insider reports that the United States is entering a \"demographic cliff\" as the birth rate, which peaked in 2007 at 4.3\u202fmillion births, has fallen to 3.6\u202fmillion in 2023.  The cohort born in 2007 is now turning 18, shrinking the pool of college applicants and future workers.  A Lightcast study projects a 6\u202fmillion\u2011worker deficit by 2032 from retiring baby boomers and a shrinking population, which will also reduce Social\u2011Security contributions.  Colleges are already feeling the strain: 11 of 31 degree\u2011granting institutions that closed in 2024 were in the Northeast, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimates that 80 more could shut by 2029.  When a school closes, only 47\u202f% of displaced students re\u2011enroll elsewhere and less than 37\u202f% of those finish a degree.  Smaller rural campuses are cutting programs, leaving underserved communities with fewer postsecondary options; the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce projects that by 2031, 72\u202f% of U.S. jobs will require some form of postsecondary education, up from 68\u202f% in 2021.  Each college closure averages a loss of 265 jobs, $14\u202fmillion in labor income, $21\u202fmillion in GDP, and $32\u202fmillion in overall economic activity (IMPLAN 2024).  The Congressional Budget Office warns that by 2033 deaths will outpace births, shrinking the labor force and slowing growth, a pattern mirrored in Japan\u2019s post\u2011war decline.  While pronatal policies such as Trump\u2019s $1,000 baby bonus are politically popular, labor economist Wafa\u202fOrman says they are unlikely to reverse the trend; immigration expansion is the only realistic solution.  Some institutions are adapting: the University of Montana, after a 40\u202f% enrollment drop from 2011\u20112019, has doubled down on non\u2011traditional students, community\u2011college licensing, and workforce\u2011development partnerships, achieving eight consecutive semesters of enrollment growth and a 74.8\u202f% retention rate.  \"It won't be solved by one silver bullet,\" says Carleton College economics professor Nathan\u202fGrawe, who warns that \"some parts of the country are going to face some really stiff challenges.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:17 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/america-economy-great-people-shortage-colleges-employers-birth-rate-2025-8)\n\n**University Enrollment for 2025 High School Exam: Initial Indicators Show High Percentages in Top Colleges**\nWith the announcement of the 2025 high school exam results, students are now focusing on the next stage of their educational journey, which is university enrollment. As the online registration for preferences has opened, initial indicators show high percentages in some top colleges, fueling competition among thousands of students, especially considering the differences between the old and new high school systems. The number of students and registration dates for the first stage are as follows: According to the data released by the Electronic Coordination Office, the total number of students in the first stage is 94,721 students, distributed as follows: New system students: 92,503 Old system students: 2,218 The first stage of university enrollment for the 2025 high school exam will start on Tuesday, July 29, and will continue until Saturday, August 2. The online coordination website will be closed at 7 pm on the last day. Students can register their preferences electronically 24/7 through the official coordination website: https://tansik.digital.gov.eg They can also visit the computer centers inside public universities daily from 9 am to 3 pm, with the option to modify their preferences throughout the registration period. Initial indicators suggest that some top colleges may have lower admission thresholds, with the medical college expected to accept students with a score of 91.56%, while the engineering college may accept students with a score of 88.44%. For students in the literary branch, the expected lower threshold is 72.81% in the new system. In the old system, the expected lower threshold for the Faculty of Medicine is 94.63%, while the Faculty of Engineering is expected to approach 90%. This reflects the continued pressure of high numbers and grades this year. It is worth noting that the Ministry of Higher Education has urged students to be cautious when choosing their preferences, to review the available university majors for each branch, and not to focus solely on top colleges, but also to consider colleges that match the student's interests and the job market.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 11:51 AM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5160437)\n\n**More U.S. Students Apply to U.K. Colleges Post-Trump**\nA record number of 7,930 American students applied to colleges or universities in the United Kingdom for fall 2025, a 14% increase from the previous year, according to UCAS data. This trend is attributed to some young Americans' decision to leave the U.S. in response to the Trump administration and its policies. Conversely, U.S. institutions are projecting a decline in international student enrollment, with 78% of 150 institutions anticipating a decrease in undergraduate and graduate international students. UCAS also reported record growth in applications from China, Ireland, and Nigeria, with international applications growing 2.2% year-over-year. However, international students from Nigeria are experiencing challenges getting visa appointments to enter the U.S., which could signal further enrollment declines in that group.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 21, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/21/more-us-students-apply-uk-colleges-post-trump)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters addressing whether the fraction of American 18-24-year-olds enrolled in college in 2025 will be at least 10% lower than in 2015 (i.e., fall to 26.91% or below) present a broad consensus that the risk of a sharp drop is higher than at any point in recent decades, due to a unique convergence of negative factors, although there is some division on whether the probability is just above or below 50%.\n\nAll experts agree on the primary headwinds: (1) the 'demographic cliff'\u2014a shrinking college-age cohort due to post-2007 birth declines; (2) substantial reductions in federal financial aid and basic needs support (especially the 2024 OBBBA Act) hitting low- and middle-income students the hardest; (3) growing public skepticism about the value and ROI of a college degree, especially as blue-collar/trade alternatives gain appeal amidst AI-driven labor market shifts; and (4) a significant wave of college closures, particularly among small or less-selective institutions, further reducing access. Additional common points include declining international student enrollment and societal/policy responses like the affirmative action ban, with uneven but generally negative effects on participation rates.\n\nThe main factors that might buffer a sharp decline are the persistent college wage premium for many fields, continued credentialism among employers, and institutional adaptation (e.g., recruitment of non-traditional students, program flexibility).\n\nFinal probability estimates cluster into three groups: (1) Those seeing the status quo inertia and institutional/cultural resilience as likely to keep the enrollment drop just under 10%: Higher Ed Admin (Enrollment Management, College Admissions) and Economics (Supply & Demand) assign probabilities of 35-38%. (2) Those arguing that the convergence of shocks tips the balance towards a historic, >=10% drop: US Demography (Cohort Analysis, Human Capital Theory), Sociology (Status Attainment), and Education Policy (Credentialism, Access), with probabilities in the 60-85% range (most in the 60-75% band). (3) One forecast at a slightly more reserved moderately-probable 'Yes' outcome (US Demography, Population Projections: 38%).\n\nAll group discussions highlight that while single shocks have led to slow declines in the past, 2025 is a unique inflection point due to simultaneous demographic, economic, policy, and social shifts. Most forecasters expect the fraction to land right around the 26.9% threshold\u2014making the outcome very sensitive to final NCES data. The most common projected outcome is a modest Yes: a decline just exceeding the threshold due to financial aid cuts, shrinking cohorts, and the rise of alternatives to college, with status attenuation theory\u2019s traditional inertia proving insufficient against the strength and timing of current negative forces.",
