The deliberation reinforced the weight of historical base rates, the rigidity of US policy response, and the adequacy of current containment mechanisms for the present situation. Given these inputs, my initial estimate of 23% is slightly above the consensus median but remains within the reasonable range. Upon reflection, I find the arguments for a somewhat more conservative estimate compelling, especially given the lack of any imminent signals of escalation and the strong status quo bias.

Critiques of higher estimates (such as those at or above 27%) are persuasive, particularly given the very short window to resolution and the current CDC/HHS communication of low risk. While my initial estimate accounted for nonzero risk from mutation or a surprise cluster, I now judge that the status quo bias and institutional friction are even stronger than I initially weighted, and that the probability of a sudden, qualifying event in the next two months is very small.

Risks to Humans, Animals, and the Pandemic Threat**\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus continues to spread across wild bird populations in Europe, particularly among cranes and waterfowl such as ducks and geese, according to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI). The FLI warns of a high risk of further outbreaks due to strong migratory activity and the ability of some surviving birds to carry and spread the virus despite reduced susceptibility. In Germany and Europe, 15 outbreaks have been reported since September 1, 2025, in poultry farms, leading to the culling of thousands of birds\u2014most notably over 35,000 chickens in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Experts rate the risk of H5N1 entering poultry holdings as very high, with transmission occurring via contact with wild birds, their droppings, or contaminated clothing and equipment. Zoo and wildlife park birds are also at risk. While H5N1 has infected 992 humans globally\u2014mainly in Asia, Turkey, Spain, the UK, and the US\u2014symptoms in humans are typically mild due to the virus\u2019s limited ability to bind to human cell receptors. However, a single mutation, such as Q226L, could significantly enhance its human receptor-binding capacity. The virus remains non-transmissible between humans and requires further mutations to become a human pandemic threat. A key concern is the potential for genetic reassortment if a human is co-infected with H5N1 and seasonal influenza, as seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In the US, H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows have been reported since 2024, with viral particles detected in raw milk (up to 20% of supermarket samples tested positive), though these cases were primarily caused by a less pathogenic variant. The FLI assesses the risk to cattle and raw milk contamination in Europe as very low, citing no import of raw milk or live cattle from the US to Germany and the processing of imported dairy products that renders viral infectivity unlikely. A single infected sheep in England was likely exposed via contaminated milking equipment on a farm with infected poultry.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:01 AM\nSource:[scinexx | Das Wissensmagazin](https://www.scinexx.de/?p=308059)\n\n**Warnings Over Avian Influenza Reaching Australian Territories: Scientists Raise Alarm, Government Assures Preparedness**\nScientists have detected potential signs of bird flu in elephant seals on Heard Island, an Australian external territory, with field observations aligning with avian influenza symptoms, though confirmation is pending. Laboratory testing of samples is scheduled for November. While no unusual bird deaths have been reported among penguins or other marine birds, the Australian Department of Agriculture describes the situation as a 'warning sign' requiring serious preparedness for a possible outbreak. Professor Sanjaya Senanayake from the Australian National University emphasized that migratory birds pose the greatest risk for spreading the virus to Australia, citing the ease of cross-continental transmission, as seen in the United States. He urged authorities to strengthen veterinary surveillance, calling for immediate testing and quarantine if symptoms appear in birds or livestock. Australian Agriculture Minister Julie Collins stated the country is 'as prepared as possible' but confirmed the situation on Heard Island remains unresolved. She urged the public not to touch dead birds and to report any mass die-offs via birdflu.gov.au. The government has allocated over AUD 100 million for surveillance, response planning, and additional funding for environmental groups monitoring wildlife. Researcher Jane Younger from the University of Tasmania warned that a potential outbreak on Heard Island could be catastrophic for regional wildlife and Australia, noting the virus has spread rapidly across the Southern Ocean in the past six months, with Macquarie Island and mainland Australia as potential next targets. She cited up to 90% chick mortality in some affected areas globally and warned marine birds would be among the first casualties. Although human infections with H5N1 are rare, the World Health Organization reported dozens of cases in the past two years, mostly among poultry workers, including one death in the U.S. Scientists caution that genetic mutations allowing the virus to jump from birds to cattle could increase the risk of a human-transmissible pandemic. Senanayake stated that the virus\u2019s ability to jump to cattle was unexpected and must be closely monitored, as avian flu could be the seed of the next global pandemic. Australia remains the only continent without a confirmed H5N1 outbreak, but its geographic location and migratory bird routes make it highly vulnerable. While the government expresses confidence in rapid response capabilities, scientists stress that prevention hinges on continuous monitoring and public awareness. Younger concluded that if the virus reaches Australia, ecological damage would be inevitable, and only surveillance would be possible, underscoring the fragility of ecological balance against an invisible threat.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[SBS](https://www.sbs.com.au/language/arabic/ar/article/bird-flu-heard-island-australia/88liqu8dg)\n\n**Bird flu spread a concern for govts, poultry industry**\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread to 10 countries in Europe and the UK by mid-October 2025\u2014marking the first time in at least a decade that such a widespread outbreak has occurred this early in the season. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) reported 56 outbreaks across the EU and UK during August to mid-October, with Poland, Spain, and Germany reporting the highest numbers. Belgium and Slovakia reported their first cases of the season, prompting Belgium to mandate that all poultry be kept indoors. France, another major poultry producer, also reported new outbreaks and issued confinement orders earlier than in previous years. Germany\u2019s Agriculture Minister Alois Rainer warned of a 'very rapid increase in infections' over the past two weeks, with the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) classifying the risk of further outbreaks as 'high'. The virus, primarily spread by migrating wild birds, has also infected mammals, including dairy cows and farmworkers, and has caused over 180 million bird deaths in the US, affecting egg prices. Brazil has recovered from an outbreak and is now free of bird flu. Japan reported its first case of the season. In a related development, Australian authorities confirmed hundreds of dead seal pups on Heard Island with symptoms consistent with H5N1, indicating the virus has reached the sub-Antarctic region\u2014making it the farthest south the virus has spread since arriving from South America in 2023. The risk to humans remains low, but the World Health Organization stresses the need for monitoring as the virus increasingly spreads to mammals. France has launched its third annual nationwide bird flu vaccination campaign for farm ducks, which it credits with curbing the disease.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 09:41 PM\nSource:[Gulf-Times](https://www.gulf-times.com/article/713690/opinion/bird-flu-spread-a-concern-for-govts-poultry-industry)\n\n**When Farmers Are Overwhelmed: Why the THW Cannot Assist in the Avian Influenza Crisis**\nGermany is experiencing a severe outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1), with over 200,000 geese, turkeys, ducks, and chickens culled across the country, particularly in Brandenburg's M\u00e4rkisch-Oderland district, where around 130,000 birds were killed in two infected poultry farms. The virus, primarily spread by cranes, thrives in colder temperatures, raising concerns as winter approaches. Although temperatures above 10\u00b0C are expected until early November, offering temporary relief, the crisis continues to escalate. Despite past THW involvement in animal disease emergencies\u2014such as African swine fever\u2014current restrictions prevent the Technical Relief Agency (THW) from assisting in the current avian flu response. The Federal Ministry of the Interior has not commented, though Brandenburg's Agriculture Minister Hanka Mittelst\u00e4dt stated that activating the THW would require declaring a crisis. Farmers are compensated by the Animal Disease Compensation Fund, currently up to \u20ac50 per animal, with plans to raise the cap to \u20ac110 per animal, pending EU approval and legislative passage\u2014though retroactive application remains uncertain. While animal disease control is primarily a state responsibility, Federal Agriculture Minister Alois Rainer (CSU) has taken personal charge, coordinating with state ministers to ensure unified, decisive action across federal and state levels.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[Bild](https://www.bild.de/leben-wissen/medizin/wenn-landwirte-ueberfordert-sind-vogelgrippe-warum-darf-das-thw-nicht-helfen-68fdfe5459e2e0975070c198)\n\n**Alarm over Avian Influenza: Outbreaks Spread Beyond Birds, Threaten Mammals and Humans**\nAvian influenza is spreading rapidly across Europe, with 56 outbreaks detected in 10 EU countries and the UK between August and mid-October 2024\u2014marking the first time in at least a decade that the virus has reached 10 countries so early in the season, despite the total number of outbreaks being lower than in 2022. The virus is now affecting not only birds but also mammals, including cattle, fawns, and seals, with over 40 mammal species infected by September 2025. In Germany, 1,000 cranes have died due to the virus, and experts warn it threatens key migratory routes. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has issued an urgent alert, stating the virus 'requires urgent global attention as it is increasingly crossing species barriers and infecting domestic and wild mammals.' In the United States, cattle are being infected with high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) with few symptoms, but their milk may transmit the virus. Scientists recommend that only milk from non-infected, pasteurized or otherwise inactivated cows should enter the market. Human risk remains low for the general population but is moderate for those in close contact with infected birds, animals, or contaminated environments. The Public Health Station in Polkowice, Poland, warns that human infections have occurred, particularly in rural and suburban areas where free-ranging poultry interact with homes and children, increasing exposure through feces and contaminated environments.

The virus, initially spreading among wild birds and then to commercial poultry farms, has prompted the culling of over 170 million birds\u2014significantly higher than the 50 million culled during the 2015 outbreak. The disease has now spread to dairy cows, raising concerns about zoonotic transmission to humans, with one confirmed death in Louisiana and 70 human cases, mostly linked to cattle contact. Experts like Dr. Abraar Karan from Stanford University warn that the virus\u2019s ability to mutate in new hosts like cows increases the risk of a more dangerous strain emerging. Despite government investments\u2014$1 billion from the USDA for pandemic response, including $100 million for vaccine research\u2014progress remains limited. The USDA\u2019s $2 billion expenditure since 2023 has had only partial success, and producers receive subsidies for culling, which critics argue disincentivizes safer farming practices. The epidemic has disrupted supply chains: egg prices have doubled since 2024, with some stores charging $10 per dozen. Businesses like Tribeca Park Cafe and Norma's Sweets report losing up to half their customers due to price hikes. While some experts like Harry Kaiser predict that high prices may eventually stimulate production and lower costs, others caution that viral mutations complicate recovery. Consumers are advised to seek alternatives like flaxseed, chia, legumes, nuts, or egg substitutes to reduce reliance on eggs. The article highlights systemic failures in disease control, political inaction, and economic consequences, with the crisis now spanning all continents except Australia.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/wideo/ptasia-grypa-jak-wplywa-na-ceny-jaj-i-co-mozemy-zrobic/889jdvr)\n\n**Avian Influenza Spreads Rapidly: What You Should Watch For**\nThe H5N1 avian influenza (bird flu) outbreak is spreading rapidly across Germany, with a significant increase in cases reported in Niedersachsen since mid-October. As of October 26, 2025, 16 outbreaks have been confirmed in the state, including five near Garrel (Landkreis Cloppenburg), one in Stuhr (Landkreis Diepholz), and one in Soltau (Landkreis Heidekreis). Two districts\u2014Gifhorn and Cloppenburg (in a restricted zone around Garrel)\u2014have implemented local stall mandates, though the state government cannot impose a statewide requirement due to legal changes since 2014. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut confirms all official cases. The current surge in infections is considered unusually high, especially compared to previous years; in 2021, Niedersachsen reported 83 outbreaks, but the current spread, particularly among cranes, has reached unprecedented levels in Germany. Authorities advise the public not to touch dead birds or those showing abnormal behavior such as head tremors or flight inability, and to report them to local veterinary offices. The Robert Koch-Institute has not recorded any human H5N1 cases in Germany, and the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut states that the population currently faces no significant risk. Consumption of poultry, eggs, and poultry products is deemed safe, as the virus is destroyed at temperatures above 70\u00b0C, which is typical in normal cooking.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 11:56 AM\nSource:[Norddeutscher Rundfunk](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/vogelgrippe-lage-verschaerft-sich-auch-in-niedersachsen,vogelgrippe-240.html)\n\n**Bird flu cases on the rise, as illness confirmed at Georgia commercial poultry farm**\nA commercial poultry farm in Gordon County, Georgia, has confirmed a case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), also known as bird flu, becoming the third such facility in the state to test positive in 2025. The farm, which housed approximately 140,000 broiler chickens, reported signs of illness on Wednesday, prompting the Georgia Department of Agriculture to deploy Emergency Management and State Agricultural Response Teams on Thursday. The teams conducted depopulation, disposal, cleaning, and disinfection of the premises. For the next two weeks, all commercial poultry operations within a 6.2-mile radius are under quarantine and subject to surveillance testing. Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler J. Harper stated the outbreak poses a 'serious threat to Georgia's #1 industry' and to the livelihoods of thousands dependent on poultry production. This follows recent outbreaks at a commercial turkey farm in Swift County, Minnesota (34,000 birds), and an egg-layer farm in Indiana (nearly 20,000 birds). According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS), HPAI was first confirmed in a U.S. commercial flock on February 8, 2022. Over the past 30 days, 64 flocks have been confirmed infected, affecting nearly 3.5 million birds. Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discussed the public health implications of the spread on 'Fox Report.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 11:41 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/health/bird-flu-cases-rise-illness-confirmed-georgia-commercial-poultry-farm)\n\n**When Farmers Are Overwhelmed: Why the THW Cannot Assist in the Avian Influenza Crisis**\nGermany is experiencing a severe outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1), with over 200,000 geese, turkeys, ducks, and chickens culled across the country, particularly in Brandenburg's M\u00e4rkisch-Oderland district, where around 130,000 birds were killed in two infected poultry farms. The virus, primarily spread by cranes, thrives in colder temperatures, raising concerns as winter approaches. Although temperatures above 10\u00b0C are expected until early November, offering temporary relief, the crisis continues to escalate. Despite past THW involvement in animal disease emergencies\u2014such as African swine fever\u2014current restrictions prevent the Technical Relief Agency (THW) from assisting in the current avian flu response. The Federal Ministry of the Interior has not commented, though Brandenburg's Agriculture Minister Hanka Mittelst\u00e4dt stated that activating the THW would require declaring a crisis. Farmers are compensated by the Animal Disease Compensation Fund, currently up to \u20ac50 per animal, with plans to raise the cap to \u20ac110 per animal, pending EU approval and legislative passage\u2014though retroactive application remains uncertain. While animal disease control is primarily a state responsibility, Federal Agriculture Minister Alois Rainer (CSU) has taken personal charge, coordinating with state ministers to ensure unified, decisive action across federal and state levels.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[Bild](https://www.bild.de/leben-wissen/medizin/wenn-landwirte-ueberfordert-sind-vogelgrippe-warum-darf-das-thw-nicht-helfen-68fdfe5459e2e0975070c198)\n\n**Avian Influenza: Prefecture Strengthens Safety Measures in Aude**\nThe Aude department in France has been placed under an 'elevated' risk level for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), following the detection of outbreaks in poultry and the presence of the virus in wild bird populations, as confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture. In response, the Aude prefecture has reinforced preventive measures and urged both farmers and private individuals to strictly adhere to biosecurity protocols. Poultry must be confined or protected by nets in backyard settings and facilities with fewer than 50 birds; larger farms must secure feed and water supplies. Gatherings of birds are banned, pigeon racing competitions are suspended until March 31, 2026, transportation of calling birds is restricted, and releases of waterfowl from the anatid family are prohibited. Vehicles transporting ducks must be equipped with tarps to prevent feather dispersion. These measures complement the ongoing third mandatory vaccination campaign, which began on October 1, 2025, targeting commercial farms with more than 250 ducks. The prefecture emphasizes that 'surveillance, biosecurity, and vaccination are the three pillars of prevention.' Owners of poultry, ducks, or game birds are required to register with the Departmental Directorate for Employment, Labour, Solidarities, and Population Protection (DDETSPP) and report any animal movements. The prefecture confirms that current HPAI strains in France and Europe pose no risk to human health, either through contact with birds or consumption of poultry products.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 04:10 AM\nSource:[Ladepeche.fr](https://www.ladepeche.fr/2025/10/26/grippe-aviaire-la-prefecture-renforce-les-mesures-de-securite-13015382.php)\n\n**Alarm over Avian Influenza: Outbreaks Spread Beyond Birds, Threaten Mammals and Humans**\nAvian influenza is spreading rapidly across Europe, with 56 outbreaks detected in 10 EU countries and the UK between August and mid-October 2024\u2014marking the first time in at least a decade that the virus has reached 10 countries so early in the season, despite the total number of outbreaks being lower than in 2022. The virus is now affecting not only birds but also mammals, including cattle, fawns, and seals, with over 40 mammal species infected by September 2025. In Germany, 1,000 cranes have died due to the virus, and experts warn it threatens key migratory routes. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has issued an urgent alert, stating the virus 'requires urgent global attention as it is increasingly crossing species barriers and infecting domestic and wild mammals.' In the United States, cattle are being infected with high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) with few symptoms, but their milk may transmit the virus. Scientists recommend that only milk from non-infected, pasteurized or otherwise inactivated cows should enter the market. Human risk remains low for the general population but is moderate for those in close contact with infected birds, animals, or contaminated environments. The Public Health Station in Polkowice, Poland, warns that human infections have occurred, particularly in rural and suburban areas where free-ranging poultry interact with homes and children, increasing exposure through feces and contaminated environments. 'Three cases have been identified' in recent reports. \nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 03:30 PM\nSource:[nextgazetapl](https://next.gazeta.pl/next/7,172392,32352388,alarm-ws-ptasiej-grypy-od-10-lat-nie-bylo-tak-zle-atakuje.html)\n\n**What Does the Current Avian Influenza Outbreak Mean for Humans?**\nThe current outbreak of avian influenza, specifically the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, is primarily affecting wild waterfowl and domestic poultry, according to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI). In response to outbreaks, all birds on affected farms are culled\u2014such as 15,000 poultry in the Alb-Donau-Kreis\u2014to prevent further spread, followed by thorough decontamination of facilities. Protection zones (3 km radius) and surveillance zones (10 km radius) are established, enforcing measures like a ban on movement and mandatory housing of poultry. Human infection remains rare; no H5N1 cases have been reported in Germany, and the Robert Koch-Institut states the risk of severe illness is currently low. While the virus can theoretically infect humans at high exposure levels, it has not been transmitted via food\u2014no cases have been linked to contaminated poultry products. The FLI confirms that cooking poultry thoroughly (no pink meat, no red juice) and fully cooking eggs (solid egg white and yolk) eliminates risk. Although H5N1 vaccines exist for birds in certain countries like France under special authorization, they are not widely used in Germany and are only suitable for specific species like ducks and geese in free-range systems. Human vaccines are available and could offer protection, but the German federal government has not centrally procured them, citing that procurement only occurs in cases of imminent or existing threat. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) continues to assess the risk to the general population as low.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 08:25 AM\nSource:[Proplanta](https://www.proplanta.de/agrar-nachrichten/verbraucher/was-bedeutet-der-aktuelle-vogelgrippe-ausbruch-fuer-den-menschen_article1761380729.html)\n\n**CDC Confirms Human H5 Bird Flu Cases in Colorado Poultry Workers - World Today News**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed four human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in Colorado poultry workers as of July 14, 2024, with a nine-member multidisciplinary team from the CDC on-site to support the state\u2019s assessment of the poultry outbreak and associated human cases. Genetic sequencing of the virus is underway, with results expected in 1\u20132 days. The CDC maintains that the public risk remains low, emphasizing that all infections are directly linked to exposure to infected poultry, with no unexpected increases in flu activity reported in Colorado or other states experiencing outbreaks in cows and poultry. A CDC spokesperson stated, 'These cases underscore the importance of taking precautions when working with potentially infected animals.' As of July 22, 2024, Colorado had confirmed a total of nine human cases linked to poultry outbreaks. Additional updates include two confirmed human cases in California (October 3, 2024) tied to dairy cow exposure and a first U.S. case without known animal exposure in Missouri (September 6, 2024), reported on August 10, 2025.

Despite this, human cases remain limited, with only one case detected in May 2022 (Canada), and no confirmed human-to-human transmission. Three leading theories explain the low human mortality: (1) pre-existing immunity from prior exposure to seasonal or past influenza strains\u2014particularly the 2009 H1N1 pandemic\u2014may offer cross-protection; (2) the virus remains highly host-specific and has not yet adapted to efficiently infect humans; and (3) limited human exposure, primarily among poultry workers and culling personnel, reduces transmission risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC emphasize continued surveillance to detect any changes in the virus that could increase transmissibility or virulence. A 2025 study confirmed that immunity from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic protects against severe H5N1 illness. Additionally, the H5N1 virus was found in raw cow\u2019s milk in the U.S., with high concentrations detected, raising new concerns about zoonotic transmission pathways. The general public risk remains low, but vigilance and biosecurity measures\u2014such as avoiding contact with sick or dead birds and practicing hand hygiene\u2014are crucial.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:03 PM\nSource:[world-today-news.com](https://www.world-today-news.com/h5n1-flu-why-north-america-isnt-more-deadly/)\n\n**Emergency Doctors Alert to Rising Avian Influenza Cases**\nThe Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (Semes) has warned that the number of outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has risen worldwide, prompting emergency services to prepare for possible human cases. Since July 2025, outbreaks have been detected in poultry farms across Extremadura, Castilla\u2011La Mancha, Andaluc\u00eda and Castilla y Le\u00f3n, as well as in wild birds in several national parks, including Do\u00f1ana. Consequently, Spain lost its 'bird\u2011flu free' status with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in mid\u2011July. Global data up to June 2025 show 1,292 outbreaks in poultry in 47 countries and 1,619 in wild birds in 49 countries. In mammals, outbreaks doubled in 2024 compared with 2023, reaching over 1,000 cases in 55 countries, with a notable outbreak in US cattle. Human cases totaled 94 with 9 deaths worldwide from 2024 to May 2025, almost all linked to direct contact with infected animals; no cases have been reported in the European Union since 2024. Dr. Beatriz Rodr\u00edguez, head of Semes\u2019 One Health group, warned that avian influenza viruses pose a risk to humans if they transmit from birds to people or evolve to spread between humans, potentially creating a pandemic\u2011capable virus. She stressed the need for a One Health approach that integrates human, animal and environmental health. Dr. Ana R\u00edos Gonz\u00e1lez echoed that, despite the low risk to the general population, vigilance, prevention and preparedness in emergency services are essential for rapid and effective management of suspected cases. The article advises the public not to touch sick or dead birds or anomalous wild mammals, to call 112 and contact Seprona if needed, and to consume only pasteurised dairy, well\u2011cooked poultry and eggs, and to wash hands after visiting farms, wetlands or reserves.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 07:55 PM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/sociedad/alerta-medicos-urgencias-emergencias-aumento-casos-gripe-aviar_2025092568d59debf10d3f06780ef9f2.html)\n\n**United States Confirms Presence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed the detection of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in a dairy herd in Nebraska, identifying the strain as genotype B3.13 of the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b. The case was discovered through state\u2011led tracing after an initial sample was taken from milk for pre\u2011distribution surveillance, a procedure mandated by a federal USDA order issued in April 2024. This marks the first known H5N1 infection in bovine in Nebraska. Following the outbreak in March 2024, infections were reported in dairy cattle across 17 states, though the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) noted that cases remained confined to a limited number of states this year. APHIS is working closely with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture to conduct further investigations, testing, and epidemiological data collection to better understand the detection and prevent wider spread. The agency urged all dairy farms to strengthen biosecurity measures, especially ahead of the upcoming fall migratory bird season, while stating there is no concern that the situation poses a risk to consumer health or the commercial milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that pasteurization effectively inactivates H5N1, ensuring the safety of pasteurized dairy products, according to Xinhua news agency. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that H5N1 viruses circulating in birds and dairy cattle pose a low risk to the general public but warned that individuals with occupational or recreational exposure to infected birds or mammals face higher risk and should take appropriate precautions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 10:13 PM\nSource:[El Comercial](https://www.elcomercial.com.ar/47257-estados-unidos-confirma-la-presencia-de-gripe-aviar-altamente-patogena)\n\n**US confirms highly pathogenic avian flu in Nebraska dairy herd**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that a dairy cattle herd in Nebraska tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13, marking the first known case of HPAI in cattle in the state. The detection followed state\u2011led tracing after an initial finding in pre\u2011movement surveillance milk samples, which are required under a federal order issued by the USDA in April 2024. Since the outbreak began in March 2024, dairy cattle infections have been reported in 17 states, though the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) notes that cases have remained confined to a small number of states this year. APHIS is working closely with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture to conduct additional on\u2011farm investigation, testing and gather epidemiological information to better understand the detection and prevent further spread. The agency urged all dairy farms to strengthen biosecurity measures, especially as the fall migratory bird season approaches. The USDA stated that there is no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health or affects the safety of the commercial milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration confirmed that pasteurisation effectively inactivates H5N1, ensuring the safety of pasteurised milk products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that H5N1 viruses circulating in birds and U.S. dairy cattle are believed to pose a low risk to the general public, but warned that individuals with occupational or recreational exposure to infected birds or mammals are at higher risk and should take appropriate precautions. HPAI is a highly contagious transboundary disease with zoonotic potential, causing variable clinical signs and high mortality rates in both wild and domestic bird populations. Current outbreaks have severely impacted countries globally, causing losses of rare and important wild bird species, as well as significant social and economic costs, including livelihood losses and egg shortages. The spread of HPAI also strains poultry\u2011related businesses, as measures such as culling and movement restrictions are necessary to contain the virus, which can disrupt the trade of poultry products. The ongoing devastation highlights the urgent need for improved control measures to prevent spillover and viral changes that could lead to a global pandemic. HPAI also infects mammals and humans, posing serious public health risks; infected mammals include domestic cats, cattle, and wild animals such as foxes and seals, with human cases, although rare, occurring in those with close contact with infected poultry or environments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 03:57 AM\nSource:[Social News XYZ](https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/09/15/us-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-flu-in-nebraska-dairy-herd/)\n\n**Another Cat Euthanized After Eating Raw Food Tainted With Bird Flu**\nOn September 5, 2025 the FDA issued a warning after a cat was euthanized for likely infection with H5N1 bird flu that had been detected in raw cat food sold by RAWR. Both samples of the Chicken Eats product (sell\u2011by 09/18/26) tested positive for Influenza A virus, with one sample containing H5N1. The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the cat had H5N1 and whole\u2011genome sequencing linked the virus to a common contamination source. WGS showed all three samples clustered together, matching a lineage detected in November\u2013December 2024 that is no longer circulating. The contaminated lot was identified as Lot CCS\u202f25\u202f093. The H5N1 strain was genotype B3.13, previously found in other raw poultry\u2011based pet foods linked to feline illness or death. Since 2024 the CDC has reported 70 human bird\u2011flu cases in the U.S., but has not updated its website in over a month and no animal cases are publicly tracked. No human has been infected through food, and the only U.S. death from the current H5N1 outbreak occurred in Louisiana in January 2024. The virus also spread to dairy cows in 2024, raising concerns about a mutated H5N1 that could transmit from human to human, though no such cases have been documented. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly opposed culling infected flocks, saying, 'We\u2019ve in fact said to [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it,' and later told Fox News, 'Most of our scientists are against the culling operation.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 12:39 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/another-cat-euthanized-after-eating-raw-food-tainted-with-bird-flu-2000654074)\n\n**California Child Infected With H5N1 Bird Flu, Source Unknown**\nA San\u202fFrancisco child infected with H5N1 bird flu in December\u202f2024 was identified through enhanced surveillance, but no clear source of exposure was found. The case, reported by the San\u202fFrancisco Department of Public Health and the CDC in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on September\u202f4\u202f2025, involved a school\u2011aged child who exhibited typical flu\u2011like symptoms\u2014fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and conjunctivitis\u2014for about a week before testing positive for H5N1. Authorities traced 67 close contacts\u2014including household members, classmates, and health\u2011care providers\u2014but all tested samples were negative, leaving no evidence of onward transmission. The child had not traveled, visited farms, or been near poultry or wild birds; the family had purchased poultry from a live\u2011bird market, but it was cooked and eaten well before the illness began. Genetic sequencing identified the virus as clade\u202f2.3.4.4b, genotype\u202fB3.13, the same lineage driving the California dairy outbreak and found in cats and wild birds, yet it lacked mutations associated with efficient human\u2011to\u2011human transmission. This case is one of 70 confirmed U.S. H5N1 infections since 2023, with only three\u2014this one included\u2014having no identifiable source. American cases have largely been mild, with one death reported, contrasting with the higher fatality rates seen globally.

They claim that this would lead to unnecessary suffering of poultry, put other animals at risk, and prolong exposure for farmworkers, increasing transmission risks for humans. Since January 2022, over 173 million birds have been infected with HPAI. Sorrell et al. suggest that this strategy would increase the risk of viral adaptation, creating long-term reservoirs of infection and raising the risk of a future pandemic. They propose instead that public health and agricultural agencies should reinforce surveillance, improve outbreak response, and adopt new science-based tools to reduce spillover risks and protect public and ecological health.

The plan, advocated by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Brooke Rollins, aims to identify birds naturally resistant to the virus by not eliminating infected animals. However, virologists warn that this strategy could have catastrophic consequences, including the risk of a new global pandemic. According to Erin Sorrell, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University, the longer the virus circulates among different species, the higher the chances of it mutating and adapting to new hosts, including humans. 'The worst-case scenario is that the virus adapts and becomes transmissible between people. Then we'll have a pandemic,' she warned. Since January 2022, the H5N1 virus has infected over 174 million birds in the US, leading to significant economic losses and increased egg prices. The virus has also been detected in wild birds, commercial flocks, and domestic farms, resulting in human deaths. Moreover, the virus has infected over 48 species of mammals, including raccoons, opossums, seals, and polar bears. The scientists argue that the government's strategy ignores the risk of viral adaptation and poses a threat to global public health. They advocate for the continuation of containment measures, such as culling infected birds, to prevent the spread of the virus and protect human populations.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 04, 2025 01:01 PM\nSource:[Canaltech](https://canaltech.com.br/saude/eua-quer-que-gripe-aviaria-se-espalhe-entre-aves-acao-pode-gerar-nova-pandemia/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasting experts are largely aligned in their view that a US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) public health emergency (PHE) declaration for H5 avian influenza by January 1, 2026 is unlikely, assigning probabilities mainly in the 8\u201328% range. The consensus reasoning is as follows: \n\n- The historical base rate for HHS PHE declarations is low and generally requires clear evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission or a substantial, direct public health threat. Previous PHEs (H1N1, Zika, COVID-19, Mpox) were declared under these conditions, which have not yet occurred for H5 avian influenza.\n- The current status (as of late October 2025) is that human H5 cases in the US are rare, mostly mild, and almost exclusively linked to direct animal exposure. No evidence of ongoing or efficient human-to-human transmission exists, and both CDC and HHS continue to rate public risk as low. Agencies are maintaining the status quo approach with surveillance and animal-focused interventions, and federal response posture is measured.\n- While there are unprecedented levels of animal morbidity and severe economic impacts (rising egg prices, supply disruptions), these have rarely, if ever, prompted a PHE absent clear human health risk.\n- Several experts note increased theoretical risk due to the virus's adaptation in mammals, ongoing mutation and reassortment potential, and winter seasonality. However, these risks remain hypothetical unless a significant change in epidemiology occurs (e.g., emergence of unexplained human cases, mutation to efficient human-to-human transmission, or severe/fatal cases outside occupational exposures).\n- Economic and political pressures are mounting but, by themselves, are unlikely to prompt a federal PHE. Political figures (including the HHS Secretary) have signaled reluctance for escalated action absent new risk to humans, and there is some political fatigue or wariness of overreacting post-pandemic.\n- Some probability is allowed for unforeseen 'focusing events' (such as a cluster of unexplained severe human cases, a mutation event, or a dramatic media/political shift) that could create a sudden policy window for declaration, but these are considered tail events.\n\nIn sum, the expert consensus is that the status quo is likely to persist in the absence of a major epidemiological or political shift. Point estimates for a PHE declaration by January 1, 2026 range from 8% to 28%, with most clustered around 15\u201325%. Key triggers that would make a declaration more probable are clear evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, a marked increase in severe or unexplained human cases, or a high-profile political or epidemiological event. Without such developments, the probability remains well below even odds.",
