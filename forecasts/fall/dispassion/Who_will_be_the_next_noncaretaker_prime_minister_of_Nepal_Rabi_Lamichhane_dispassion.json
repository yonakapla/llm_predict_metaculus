I agree that the path to the premiership for someone with Lamichhane\u2019s baggage requires not only elite acquiescence (which is clearly absent) but also drastic further destabilization that is not in evidence. Importantly, this analysis further tightens the case against Lamichhane by noting that the next 'proper' non-caretaker PM is functionally locked in for after the scheduled 2026 elections, regardless of continuing unrest or mass sentiment.

By addressing both Lamichhane\u2019s ongoing legal barriers and his lack of a broad coalition (despite protest-driven popularity), the argument tightly binds together the legal, procedural, and practical hurdles. The reasoning is well-calibrated, recognizing the role of caretaker governments in Nepal\u2019s recent political history and the rarity of disruptive, outsider ascensions between established electoral cycles.

The observation that recent precedent does not support the scenario of a recently jailed, outsider figure leapfrogging to the premiership through protest momentum is well-founded.

Group deliberation reinforced these points across different expert perspectives: all placed heavy emphasis on caretaker entrenchment, procedural obstacles, elite vetoes, and the structural inertia of the current system. The slight nonzero probabilities offered by some\u2014rooted only in hypothetical tail-risk events like sudden collapse of consensus or mass-movement-driven rupture\u2014do not present any new evidence, nor additional credible likelihood that Lamichhane could overcome the confluence of legal, institutional, and coalition hurdles by Jan 1, 2026. Since no new scenario or overlooked factor was uncovered that would meaningfully increase his odds, I see no reason to alter my initial estimate.",

It identifies three main candidates: Balen Shah, Mayor of Kathmandu; Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar, a senior businessman and media founder; and Rabi Lamichhane, a media personality and party leader. The piece evaluates each candidate\u2019s strengths and risks. Balen Shah is described as an \"untainted outsider\" who mobilises youth but lacks broader governance experience and may alienate elites. Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is portrayed as a \"stable, moderate, and consensus\u2011oriented\" figure with strong business and diplomatic ties, though he has limited mass appeal. Rabi Lamichhane is noted for mass appeal and anti\u2011corruption rhetoric but faces legal controversies and credibility questions. The article concludes that Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is the most internationally palatable candidate for an interim prime minister, offering a balanced, neighbour\u2011friendly statesmanship.

According to the piece, at least 72 people were killed and 2\u202f000 injured, and preliminary estimates put the damage at 2\u202fto\u202f20\u202fbillion euros.  The protests destroyed key state buildings \u2013 the Parliament, the Supreme Court, ministries, police stations, hotels and the headquarters of *The Kathmandu Post* \u2013 and set fire to the historic Singha\u202fDurbar complex.  A Ministry of Health employee lamented, \u2018I understand that the youth want change, but it is a mess, all the archives go up in smoke,\u2019 while a transport ministry official said, \u2018Do not confuse politicians with the buildings that serve the people.\u2019  The unrest was inspired by earlier youth\u2011led movements in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri\u202fLanka, and the article notes that the youth of Nepal, often called \u2018Nepo\u2011kids,\u2019 used TikTok and Discord to organize.  After the army imposed a curfew, the youth elected former Supreme Court chief Sushila\u202fKarki as prime minister via a Discord vote, a move described as \u2018the first government head elected on Discord.\u2019  The article quotes economist Raghu\u202fBir\u202fBista: \u2018Beyond the amounts, Generation\u202fZ burned symbols.

Karki, 73, who was appointed on September\u202f12, took office following an agreement with leaders of the largely youth\u2011led \u2018Gen\u202fZ\u2019 protest movement.  The military, which enforced a curfew during the unrest, ultimately consented to her leadership of a caretaker government charged with overseeing elections within six months.

Former chief justice Sushila Karki, 73, was sworn in as interim prime minister on September 13, 2025, becoming the country\u2019s first female leader. Her appointment followed the resignation of KP Sharma Oli and the dissolution of parliament, with new elections slated for March 2026. Protesters had stormed Kathmandu, torching the Supreme Court, the Attorney General\u2019s office, the Prime Minister\u2019s residence and Parliament; security forces reported that more than 12,500 prisoners escaped from jails amid the chaos. Karki\u2019s emergence was the result of negotiations involving army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel, President Ram Chandra Paudel and youth activists on Discord. Suraj Bhattarai, a social worker, said 'We believe she will push forward the fight against corruption and promote good governance.' The article notes that the unrest was sparked by corruption, economic hardship and a controversial social media ban, and that the government\u2019s decision was aimed at curbing fake news and hate speech, though protesters viewed it as a crackdown on free expression.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 09:41 AM\nSource:[icirnigeria.org](https://www.icirnigeria.org/nepal-calm-as-first-female-prime-minister-takes-charge-after-deadly-protests/)\n\n**When will Nepal get new PM? Gen-Z 'cracks', suspense grows as names shuffle | What we know so far**\nScuffles were reported among Gen\u2011Z factions backing different contenders outside the Nepal Army headquarters in Kathmandu on Wednesday evening, as talks to pick an interim leader after the violent overthrow of the government extended into the third day. The post of prime minister has been vacant since KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday. Four names have emerged as potential candidates: Kathmandu mayor and rapper Balendra Shah 'Balen', former chief justice Sushila Karki, former chief of the electricity board Kulman Ghising, and current mayor of Dharan Harka Raj Sampang Rai. The scuffle on Thursday evening involved supporters of Balen, Karki or Sampang, according to multiple outlets. No final decision has yet been reached; talks are ongoing among Gen\u2011Z representatives, President Ram Chandra Paudel and the army chief. The President issued an appeal for calm and said he was doing his best to find a solution, with a letter seen as a signal to Gen\u2011Z representatives to 'take the onus and decide'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 11:19 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-nepal-get-new-leader-wait-extends-gen-z-cracks-what-we-know-so-far-101757588087511.html)\n\n**'Gen Z' protests: What's next for Nepal?**\nThousands of demonstrators in Nepal marched to demand the lifting of a social\u2011media ban that sparked a wave of anti\u2011corruption protests and led to the resignation of the prime minister on Tuesday. The protests, which have already claimed at least 19 lives, are dominated by Generation\u202fZ (born 1997\u20112012) and lack a single leader. The army has called for talks, but it is unclear whom the government can negotiate with. Constitutional expert Balaram\u202fKC said, 'Gen\u202fZ should set up a negotiation team,' and added that the president should then hold talks with that team, civil\u2011society members and the army. Under Nepal\u2019s 2015 constitution a successor must be chosen from the party with a parliamentary majority; if none exists the president appoints a candidate who can secure a majority and must win a confidence vote within 30\u202fdays. If that fails, the house may be dissolved and elections held. Experts such as Bipin\u202fAdhikari propose a temporary interim government that could pursue the reforms demanded by Gen\u202fZ and hold elections within six months. Potential leaders favored by the youth include Balendra\u202fShah, the 35\u2011year\u2011old mayor of Kathmandu elected in 2022, and Rabi\u202fLamichhane, a former TV journalist who founded the Rastriya\u202fSwatantra\u202fParty in 2022 and was reportedly freed from prison by protesters.

Gen\u2011Z groups, notably Hami Nepal, held an hours\u2011long online discussion on Discord and voted to endorse former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as caretaker prime minister.  The Army chief, Ashokraj\u202fSigdel, was informed of the choice, while other Gen\u2011Z\u2011style groups\u2014including royalists and those who allegedly infiltrated the Monday\u2011night rally that killed 20 people\u2014were invited to meet at the army headquarters on Thursday.  Former National Human Rights Commissioner Mohna\u202fAnsari wrote on social media that \u201cFormer Chief Justice Sushila Karki is the best option to address the adverse circumstances prevailing in the nation\u201d and urged the President to act transparently.  The Constitution\u2019s Article\u202f273 allows the President to declare a state of emergency, which must be endorsed by a two\u2011thirds majority of Parliament within a month and would then last three months.  Analysts such as Krishna\u202fKhanal argue that a middle\u2011ground solution is needed, noting that the 2015 Constitution was the product of nearly a decade of negotiation and that a new charter could destabilise the country.  The article cites that 30 people died during the violent protests on Monday and Tuesday, and that 12 Gen\u2011Z\u2011style groups were involved in the discussions.  It also lists potential caretaker candidates\u2014Balen\u202fShah, Kulman\u202fGhising, Sumana\u202fShrestha\u2014and notes that Rabi\u202fLamichhane was released from jail on Tuesday after eight months of incarceration for embezzlement.

Constitutional expert Balaram K.C. said, 'Gen Z should set up a negotiation team,' and added that the president should then hold talks with the team, civil society members and the army.

It identifies three main candidates: Balen Shah, Mayor of Kathmandu; Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar, a senior businessman and media founder; and Rabi Lamichhane, a media personality and party leader. The piece evaluates each candidate\u2019s strengths and risks. Balen Shah is described as an \"untainted outsider\" who mobilises youth but lacks broader governance experience and may alienate elites. Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is portrayed as a \"stable, moderate, and consensus\u2011oriented\" figure with strong business and diplomatic ties, though he has limited mass appeal. Rabi Lamichhane is noted for mass appeal and anti\u2011corruption rhetoric but faces legal controversies and credibility questions. The article concludes that Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is the most internationally palatable candidate for an interim prime minister, offering a balanced, neighbour\u2011friendly statesmanship.

Demonstrators set fire to the Parliament, the President's Office, the PM's residence, the Supreme Court, political party offices and homes of senior leaders. At least 19 people were killed in Monday's protests by Gen Z over corruption and a government ban on social media, which was lifted Monday night. A mob set a house belonging to former prime minister Jhala Nath Khanal on fire in Dallu; his wife Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar sustained serious burn injuries and later died at Kirtipur Burn Hospital. The Supreme Court building, Singhdurbar, the President's Office at Maharajgunj and the PM's residence at Baluwatar were also set ablaze. The Kantipur Television office in Tinkune, as well as police posts at Gaushala, Lubhu and Kalimati, were vandalised and set on fire. The house of former prime minister and Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba in Budhanilkantha was also torched. Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balen Shah urged calm and called for talks with the Army chief, but insisted Parliament must be dissolved first. Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman Rabi Lamichhane was released from jail; a party leader said, 'Since the administration said they could not provide security and asked the family to take responsibility, his family took charge,' according to My Republica. Meanwhile, a few Telugu families of Indian origin were stranded in Kathmandu; they had been staying at a top hotel but were moved to a nearby guest house after agitators knocked on the doors.

The protests were sparked by a ban on 26 social media apps, including Instagram, Facebook and X. The violence also saw the burning of Oli\u2019s home in Bhaktapur and stone\u2011throwing at the residences of Deputy Prime Minister Bishnu Paudel and Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Biswo Paudel. In the same week, 21 MPs from Rabi Lamichhane\u2019s Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) resigned, heightening the political crisis. Lamichhane, a former home minister and media personality, is seen as a potential successor, but his ability to lead depends on his release from jail. Another possible contender is Balendra \u201cBalen\u201d Shah, the independent Mayor of Kathmandu, who has publicly supported the Gen\u2011Z protests and urged that the movement remain non\u2011partisan. The situation remains volatile, with sources saying clarity may emerge in the next 24\u201348 hours. The article cites a quote from Shah: 'The rally is clearly a spontaneous movement of Gen\u2011Z...

    "summary": "All seven experts assign an extremely low probability\u2014ranging from 1% to 3%\u2014that Rabi Lamichhane will become the next non-caretaker prime minister of Nepal before January 1, 2026. Their consensus is founded on several core factors: (1) Lamichhane's recent or ongoing legal troubles (generally described as being 'behind bars' for embezzlement), which create strong constitutional and practical eligibility barriers. (2) The explicit caretaker/interim mandate of current Prime Minister Sushila Karki, who is supported by the political elite, military, and international actors to maintain stability and conduct elections by March 2026. (3) The lack of institutional, elite, or coalition support for Lamichhane, with his outsider, divisive status, and his limited party's seat share making coalition-building for a confidence vote nearly impossible. (4) Strong international and domestic incentives for a technocratic, consensus caretaker government until elections, barring a total collapse or spectacular crisis. (5) Historical and regional base rates that show vanishingly few instances of recently-imprisoned, controversial outsider figures rising immediately to executive power under such highly constrained, post-uprising conditions. While all experts note the unpredictable volatility following the Gen Z-led protests and Lamichhane's undeniable youth appeal, they concur that the dominant forces\u2014elite resistance, strict legal hurdles, a clear procedural status quo, and international pressure for stability\u2014heavily outweigh the prospects for an extraordinary, rapid-outlier breakthrough. Only a complete caretaker government collapse combined with legal exoneration, party system paralysis, and a unique elite-protest consensus could plausibly deliver a Yes outcome, which all agree is extremely improbable within the resolution window.",
