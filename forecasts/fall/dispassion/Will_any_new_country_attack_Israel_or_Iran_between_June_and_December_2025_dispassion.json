The current environment is extremely tense, but the demonstration of overwhelming force by Israel and the US, clear threats of massive retaliation, and the deterrence effect of US security guarantees to allies and partners make new state attacks highly costly. Regional actors have strong incentives to avoid direct, overt attacks due to the risk of devastating retaliation, domestic instability, and possible loss of US support.

Israel and Iran have both demonstrated high willingness to retaliate against new entrants, and the risk of escalation to a wider regional or even global war is acute. While there are strong anti-Iran or anti-Israel sentiments among some regional states, their historical preference for indirect action (via proxies or covert ops) is likely to persist, especially given the high costs observed in June's kinetic exchanges. The base rate for new state entries into Middle Eastern conflicts after the initial escalation is low. However, there remains a non-trivial risk of miscalculation, rogue action, or an incident that is unambiguously attributed to a new state, particularly involving Lebanon (Hezbollah) or Syria, but most such actors have incentives to avoid overt attribution and escalation. On balance, the probability of a new state attacking Israel or Iran between June and December 2025 is low, but not negligible given the volatility, so I assign a probability of 13%.",

No new, compelling evidence has emerged to materially increase or decrease the risk from my initial assessment. Therefore, my revised probability remains unchanged.",

My initial probability (7%) is at the lower end but is well-supported by the rational actor, attribution, and regime incentive arguments, as well as the lack of credible indicators of imminent direct entry by new states. While some group members make a strong case for a small upward adjustment due to the unique volatility of the post-June 2025 environment, I find that the fine print's strict attribution requirement and the absence of new warning signs since June justify maintaining a forecast at the lower end.

Nearly all forecasters anchor their assessments in the historical base rate of state-on-state escalation in the region, the powerful deterrence effect of US involvement, and the prevalence of proxy warfare. Notably, critiques of lower probabilities (e.g., 7%) correctly argue that the unique post-June 2025 environment marginally elevates risk due to volatility, fog of war, and regime instability, but not enough to depart significantly from the status quo. Conversely, those advocating for even lower probabilities emphasize the restraining effect of diplomacy and the strict attribution criteria. My own initial forecast (13%) sits at the top end of consensus, reflecting slightly greater weight on volatility and sectarian network spillover risk. However, after group discussion, I see merit in tightening my estimate to better align with the modal view: while nonzero, the risk is best represented just below my original figure. The most compelling arguments for a slight reduction are the persistent absence of actionable warning indicators and the successful containment of escalation after massive violence\u2014suggesting that a 10% probability more accurately reflects the current balance of risks.",

The IRGC emphasized that any new mistake or potential aggression from the enemy will be met with a harsher, more precise, and more devastating response than previous actions under Operation Sadiq Promise. On September 30, an Iranian official told the Mehr News Agency that there was no military activity in the region, and Iran's armed forces remained fully prepared. This came after an Israeli military official threatened a return to war with Iran following the activation of UN sanctions, claiming Israel and Iran are engaged in a regional arms race and that Israel is preparing for various scenarios, including a potential military response against Iran. The official asserted that Iran suffered a severe blow in the previous confrontation and fully understands the extent of the damage and Israel\u2019s military capabilities. In a surprise escalation, Israel launched a 12-day war against Iran on June 13 with U.S. support, targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites, assassinating military and nuclear scientists, and destroying infrastructure. Iran retaliated by striking Israeli military and intelligence facilities with ballistic missiles and drones, causing unprecedented destruction and panic, resulting in 28 deaths and 3,238 injuries, according to Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:55 AM\nSource:[Elnashra News](https://www.elnashra.com/news/show/1743959/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%20%D8%A3%D9%8A-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A3-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B3)\n\n**Israel Considers Launching a New Attack Against Iran**\nAccording to a senior Israeli military official, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are preparing for multiple scenarios, including the possibility of launching another attack against Iran. The official stated, 'We are closely monitoring developments across the Middle East and in Iran. Both Israel and Iran are engaged in an arms race and a learning process. We are preparing for various scenarios and possibilities, one of which is that we may need to act against Iran again.' The official added that Iran has suffered a significant blow from Israel and is fully aware of the extent of the damage and Israel's capabilities. Meanwhile, Mohsen Rezaei, former commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, warned in a state television interview that Iran would enter a war with the United States if Israel launches another attack, and emphasized that Tehran would not accept negotiations with Western countries that could allow Israel time to prepare or strengthen its position. This follows the '12-day war' that began on June 13, when Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military commanders, senior officials, and nuclear scientists\u2014many of whom were killed along with their families. The conflict escalated when the U.S. joined the assault, striking three major Iranian nuclear sites. In response, Iran attacked the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, located in Qatar. A ceasefire was announced on June 24, ending the hostilities between Tel Aviv and Tehran.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/567016-israel-evaluaria-lanzar-nuevo-ataque-iran)\n\n**Jeffrey Sachs Suggests U.S. Involvement in Conflict with Iran**\nAccording to Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist and professor at Columbia University, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may attempt to involve the United States in a military conflict with Iran. In an interview with journalist Tucker Carlson, Sachs stated that the likelihood of such a conflict is high, citing Netanyahu's consistent resolve on this issue over nearly thirty years. Sachs noted that Netanyahu has previously initiated U.S. military-political intervention in Iran's affairs and may seek to repeat this strategy. On the night of June 13, Israel launched a military operation against Iran, accusing Tehran of developing a secret nuclear weapons program. Targets included nuclear facilities, military leadership, prominent nuclear scientists, and airbases. Iran rejected the allegations and launched retaliatory strikes. For 12 days, both sides exchanged attacks, and the United States joined the conflict by conducting a single strike on Iranian nuclear sites on the night of June 22. On June 23, Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. military base Al-Udeid in Qatar, stating it did not seek further escalation. U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope that Iran's action was a way to release tension and that current events could lead to peace in the Middle East. He also announced that a ceasefire agreement had been reached between Israel and Iran, set to officially end the 12-day armed confrontation within 24 hours.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 01:06 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/dzheffri-saks-predpolagaet-vovlechenie-ssha-v-konflikt-s-iranom-706594.html)\n\n**Netanyahu Trying to Drag the U.S. into War with Iran, Expert Says**\nAccording to an expert, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is attempting to draw the United States into a war with Iran.

The measure, adopted by MPs during a 12-day Israeli military aggression against Iran from June 13 to June 24, 2025, will take effect once the president is notified by Parliament. The Israeli assault, described as 'blatant and unprovoked,' killed at least 1,064 people, including military commanders, nuclear scientists, and civilians. The United States also violated international law by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites. In response, Iran launched retaliatory strikes targeting strategic sites in occupied territories and the al-Udeid air base in Qatar, the largest U.S. military base in West Asia, successfully halting the aggression. During the conflict, drones and munitions were smuggled into Iran, leading to the arrest of several spies linked to Israel\u2019s Mossad. Three men\u2014Idris Aali, Azad Shojaei, and Rasoul Ahmad\u2014were convicted of 'corruption on earth' (fesad fil arz) and 'waging war against God' (moharebeh) for smuggling remotely controlled assassination devices disguised as alcoholic beverages to assassinate Iranian officials. After a trial in the Revolutionary Court of Urmia and a review by the supreme court, their death sentences were upheld and executed in Urmia. Additional Mossad agents were reportedly arrested across Iran following the aggression. The judiciary confirmed the legal process included defense representation and extensive documentation of foreign collaboration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:42 PM\nSource:[Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/518606/Iran-to-aggravate-punishment-for-spies)\n\n**Iran's Revolutionary Guard: Any New Enemy Mistake or Attack Will Be Met with Harsh Retaliation**\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) stated in a statement marking the anniversary of Operation 'Sadiq Promise' against Israel that the operation was both a severe punishment for enemy attacks amid international inaction and a clear message to the world and the 'cruel and vicious Zionist entity' that the era of threats without consequences has ended.

On the evening of June 23, Iran launched missile strikes on the U.S. base Al-Udeid in Qatar, stating that it had no intention of further escalating the conflict.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20251002/netanjahu-2045760493.html)\n\n**Iran to aggravate punishment for spies**\nIran has approved a motion to intensify punishment for espionage and collusion with the Israeli regime and other countries deemed hostile to its national security, according to the Guardians Council spokesperson Hadi Tahan. The measure, adopted by MPs during a 12-day Israeli military aggression against Iran from June 13 to June 24, 2025, will take effect once the president is notified by Parliament. The Israeli assault, described as 'blatant and unprovoked,' killed at least 1,064 people, including military commanders, nuclear scientists, and civilians. The United States also violated international law by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites. In response, Iran launched retaliatory strikes targeting strategic sites in occupied territories and the al-Udeid air base in Qatar, the largest U.S. military base in West Asia, successfully halting the aggression. During the conflict, drones and munitions were smuggled into Iran, leading to the arrest of several spies linked to Israel\u2019s Mossad. Three men\u2014Idris Aali, Azad Shojaei, and Rasoul Ahmad\u2014were convicted of 'corruption on earth' (fesad fil arz) and 'waging war against God' (moharebeh) for smuggling remotely controlled assassination devices disguised as alcoholic beverages to assassinate Iranian officials. After a trial in the Revolutionary Court of Urmia and a review by the supreme court, their death sentences were upheld and executed in Urmia. Additional Mossad agents were reportedly arrested across Iran following the aggression. The judiciary confirmed the legal process included defense representation and extensive documentation of foreign collaboration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:42 PM\nSource:[Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/518606/Iran-to-aggravate-punishment-for-spies)\n\n**Unprecedented U.S. Military Buildup in the Middle East Sparks Fears of Escalation**\nIn October 2025, a significant deployment of U.S. KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar has raised concerns about potential military escalation in the Middle East. The movement, described as unprecedented, signals a heightened U.S. military readiness in the region amid rising tensions following a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel and recent Israeli attacks on Qatari territory. The KC-135s are critical for aerial refueling, enabling long-range missions by U.S. fighter jets in the Persian Gulf. This deployment coincides with controversial statements by U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and former President Donald Trump\u2019s nuclear threats, as well as prior aircraft movements before the June U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While the Pentagon has not issued official statements, unconfirmed military sources cite a 'logistical reinforcement' in anticipation of a critical phase. Iran has responded with strong rhetoric, vowing to expand its missile capabilities and retaliate decisively, with former Revolutionary Guard commander Mohsen Rezaei stating that Iran would enter war with the U.S. if Israel attacks. The situation is further complicated by reports of U.S.-Israel joint plans for a large-scale military strike on Iran, including operations in southern Iran and control of the Persian Gulf. Simultaneously, the U.S. has pressured India to sever ties with Iran and abandon the Chabahar port, while a U.S. delegation visited Kabul amid internet blackouts by the Taliban. Iran has strengthened military ties with Russia and China, including missile technology transfers and Russian military flights. The article questions whether this represents strategic deterrence or a descent into open conflict, with Qatar\u2019s strategic role as the U.S. Central Command hub becoming increasingly central. The article also notes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was forced by Trump to publicly apologize to Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani after a prior attack on Doha, highlighting shifting regional dynamics.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[DAGOSPIA](http://www.dagospia.com/cronache/ci-strani-movimenti-cieli-mediorientali-gli-uniti-schierato-decine-449118)\n\n**Iran's Revolutionary Guards call to extend missile range in wake of war with Israel**\nIn response to Western demands to limit Iran's missile capabilities\u2014seen as a major obstacle to a nuclear deal\u2014Mohammadjafar Asadi, deputy inspector of the Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, stated that Iran will extend its missile range to any point deemed necessary. Iran currently self-imposes a 2,000-kilometer (1,200-mile) missile range, sufficient to reach Israel, but has increasingly launched missiles from eastern regions of the country following Israeli strikes on western launch sites in June 2024. Asadi claimed that the current missile range limited the June war to 12 days and implied that expanded range would enhance Iran\u2019s deterrence in future conflicts. The conflict was triggered by Israel\u2019s large-scale attack on Iran\u2019s military leadership, nuclear scientists, enrichment sites, and missile program, which Israel justified as preventing Iran\u2019s stated goal of destroying the Jewish state. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons but has enriched uranium to weapons-grade levels, obstructed international inspections, and expanded its ballistic missile program. In retaliation, Iran launched over 500 ballistic missiles and approximately 1,100 drones at Israel, resulting in 31 deaths, over 3,000 injuries, 36 missile impacts, one drone strike in populated areas, damage to 2,305 homes across 240 buildings, two universities, a hospital, and displacement of over 13,000 Israelis. The Times of Israel reported these developments on October 1, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 04:34 PM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-revolutionary-guards-call-to-extend-missile-range-in-wake-of-war-with-israel/)\n\n**Israel Strikes Iran - Jewish Policy Center**\nEdwin Black's book, 'Israel Strikes Iran: Operation Rising Lion - The 20-Year Backstory,' provides a detailed account of the buildup to Israel's military actions against Iran, emphasizing long-term strategic planning and intelligence efforts. The book highlights Iran's persistent nuclear ambitions, including uranium enrichment and weapon development, which predated and continued beyond the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Black details how Iran received support from other nations and benefited from Western sanctions relief or non-enforcement, enabling its nuclear program. Despite widespread awareness of Iran's cheating, few acted. Black, an award-winning investigative journalist, traces the timeline of events from 2004 onward, including the development of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bunker buster, which was kept secret for over two decades by hundreds of U.S. Defense Department personnel and officials. The 2025 update reveals that Israel executed 'Operation Midnight Hammer'\u2014a highly synchronized strike involving twelve MOPs at Fordow, two at Natanz, and Tomahawk cruise missiles at Isfahan\u2014within minutes. The book also covers covert operations such as the 2018 theft of Iran\u2019s nuclear archive, assassinations of Iranian scientists, and sabotage of facilities. Israel\u2019s retaliatory actions included the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, pager attacks on Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon on September 17, and the destruction of Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut on September 27. Iran responded, but Israel\u2019s defenses successfully intercepted a massive barrage in April 2024, which included 30 cruise missiles, 120 ballistic missiles, and 170 drones, injuring a seven-year-old girl in Arad. The book concludes with a cautionary note from Black: 'The most important warning of this book is contained not in the text written above, but the text yet to be written below... Our destiny paragraph is yet to be written.'

The assault resulted in at least 1,064 deaths, including military commanders, nuclear scientists, and civilians. The United States joined the conflict by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites, which Safavi described as a grave violation of international law. Iran responded with retaliatory operations on June 24, successfully halting the aggression. Safavi stated that over 500 missiles were fired at Israeli-occupied territories, causing extensive damage to installations in Haifa and other areas, including refineries, power plants, and research centers. He noted that some missile impacts were equivalent to earthquakes, affecting areas within a 3-kilometer radius. Safavi also acknowledged that Iran was initially deceived and caught off guard, indicating a need to improve strategic intelligence. He claimed Israel imposed a news blackout to conceal the true extent of its losses.

According to Day.Az, explosions in different parts of the city are being shared on social media. Earlier, Trump stated that Israel and Iran agreed to cease fire in the next few hours. It is worth noting that on June 13, Israel launched airstrikes on Iran, resulting in the deaths of several military personnel, including the head of the Iranian General Staff, Mohammad Bagheri, and the commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami. In response, Iran launched over 150 ballistic missiles and more than 100 drones at Tel Aviv and other Israeli regions, resulting in civilian casualties and significant damage. Since then, the exchange of blows between the two sides has continued. On June 22, the US Air Force launched airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, reportedly destroying all three. On June 23, Iran launched rocket attacks on US bases in Qatar and Iraq, as part of its 'Good News of Victory' operation. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) released a statement in response to the attack on the US base in Qatar, stating, 'In response to the obvious military aggression of the criminal regime of the United States of America against the peaceful nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the gross violation of international law, the IRGC launched a powerful and devastating rocket attack on the Al-Udeid base in Qatar.' The Qatari Ministry of Defense reported that the Iranian rocket attack was successfully repelled, with no casualties or injuries reported.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 23, 2025 10:55 PM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https://news.day.az/world/1762994.html)\n\n**TIMELINE: Iran retaliates with missile strike on US bases; global fears of escalation grow**\nIsrael and the United States launched airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, prompting Iran to retaliate with a missile strike on US bases in Qatar.

Israeli planes continued to pound targets in Tehran and western Iran after 10 days of fighting. Zamir credited close coordination between Israeli and American diplomatic and military leaders for a series of high-powered strikes on Iran's Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites. The US dropped 14 bunker-buster bombs, more than two dozen Tomahawk missiles, and over 125 military aircraft, including seven B-2 stealth bombers, in the operation dubbed 'Midnight Hammer.' Iran has launched over 500 ballistic missiles and around 1,000 drones at Israel, killing 24 people and wounding thousands. Zamir said, 'We've gotten to a turning point in the battle, after last night, [when] the US military struck central nuclear sites in a lethal, precise and very impressive way.'

Trump announced in a public address on June 21 that 'we have successfully completed a very successful attack on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow and Natanz and Isfahan.' The attack involved B-2 stealth bombers, which are equipped with the largest bombs in the world, the 'Bunker Buster GBU-57.' According to major news outlets, including the New York Times, six B-2 bombers dropped 12 13.6-ton Bunker Buster bombs on the Fordow nuclear facility, while a US Navy submarine launched 30 Tomahawk missiles at the Natanz and Isfahan facilities. Trump said, 'Iran must now choose peace. If not, future attacks will be stronger and easier to carry out.' Iran's state TV warned that 'all American citizens or military personnel are now legitimate targets,' and Iran-backed Hamas and Houthi rebels have condemned the US airstrikes and vowed to retaliate.

Trump warned that if Iran retaliates, it will face 'even greater retaliation.' This is the first time the US has directly attacked Iranian territory, marking a new stage in the strategic confrontation between the US and Iran. The US military deployed 6 B-2 stealth bombers from a base in Missouri, which flew over 640 kilometers to strike the facilities. The Fordow facility was hit by 12 GBU-57 'bunker buster' bombs, while the Natanz and Isfahan facilities were struck by 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from a submarine. Trump claimed that the operation was a 'spectacular military victory' and that the Iranian nuclear facilities had been 'completely destroyed.' The targets include: Fordow, a key underground nuclear facility located 192 kilometers south of Tehran, where the International Atomic Energy Agency detected 83.7% enriched uranium in 2023; Natanz, a major uranium enrichment facility that was previously attacked by Israel on June 13; and Isfahan, a nuclear technology center responsible for converting natural uranium into UF6 gas.

The US Navy also launched 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine, targeting Isfahan and Natanz. Trump stated that the three facilities 'have been completely and totally destroyed.' Iran's Foreign Minister Araghchi condemned the US for violating international law and stated that Iran will 'reserve all options to defend its sovereignty, interests, and people.' Iran has only responded with a few missile launches towards Israel, but not against the US. The US military has deployed troops to the region and is on high alert, with bases in Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE potentially being targeted by Iran. The US is also concerned about the potential for proxy attacks by Iran's allies, such as Hezbollah and Hamas. China and Russia, as key allies of Iran, are being watched closely, but it is unlikely that they will intervene directly in the conflict.

The operation, code-named 'The Rising Left', aimed to inflict significant damage on Iran's nuclear and missile potential. Between June 13-21, the Israeli military attacked over 1000 targets in Iran, primarily military and nuclear facilities. Many rocket launchers were destroyed in western and central Iran, and control was established over the airspace. As a result of the precision strikes, the top command of the IRGC, Iranian army, and intelligence were eliminated, as well as nine nuclear scientists. Iran claims that hundreds of people were killed and thousands injured on its territory in the first days of the war. Iran responded with drone and rocket attacks. A hospital in Be'er-Sheva was attacked. Some rockets fell in residential areas in Tel Aviv, Ramat-Gan, Bnei-Brak, Rishon LeZion, Bat Yam, Holon, Tamar, Haifa, Petah Tikva, and other cities. 24 people were killed, over 1000 were injured. The ninth day of the war is ongoing. According to Israeli sources, the US attacked a nuclear facility in Fordo with six GBU-57 bombs, and launched 30 Tomahawk missiles from a submarine against nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan. Other US attacks have not been reported yet, but they are ready for active combat operations. Distracting attacks were carried out by the Israeli Air Force. The US and Israeli military operations against Iran's nuclear facilities have been confirmed by Iranian authorities. The Director-General of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, confirmed that on June 21, Israeli aircraft attacked a nuclear complex in the Iranian city of Isfahan for the second time since the start of the war. According to the IAEA, six buildings of the nuclear complex were damaged, including a centrifuge production plant.

According to US President Trump, these facilities have been 'completely and thoroughly destroyed.' Trump stated, 'Our goal is to destroy Iran's uranium enrichment capability and prevent this Middle East country, which is the largest supporter of terrorism, from manufacturing nuclear weapons.' He emphasized that all US military aircraft involved in the attack have safely left Iranian airspace and declared, 'Now is the time for peace.' Trump also warned on social media platform Truth Social that if Iran retaliates against the US, it will face 'even stronger counterattacks.' The US used B-2 stealth bombers carrying heavy GBU-57 'massive bunker buster bombs' to drop several massive bombs on Fordow, while Natanz and Isfahan were attacked with approximately 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from US submarines. Iran initially denied the attack, but later confirmed that the three facilities were attacked, stating that nuclear materials had been removed beforehand to minimize losses. Iran warned that all US citizens and military personnel in the Middle East region will become 'attack targets,' and hardline parliamentarian Hamid Rasaei called for a 'strong response' to the strike. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu supported the action, calling it a 'historic declaration,' while UN Secretary-General Guterres expressed concern that it could lead to a regional conflict and urged all parties to return to diplomatic channels.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 22, 2025 04:07 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u982d\u6bbc Newtalk](https://newtalk.tw/news/view/2025-06-22/977683)\n\n**Trump Announces US Military Strike on Iranian Nuclear Facilities**\nUS President Trump announced on June 21 that the US military had successfully launched a strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. According to CBS, Trump stated on his social media platform 'Truth Social' that 'we have successfully completed the attack on Iran's three nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan.' He emphasized that all planes have left Iranian airspace and 'all ammunition has been dropped on the main target Fordow.' Trump also stated that 'now is the time to pursue peace.' Trump described the operation as 'a spectacular military success' and stated that 'Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely destroyed.' Fordow is considered a critical facility in Iran's nuclear program, located 300 feet underground with multiple air defenses. Experts believe that the most effective way to destroy the facility is to use the US-made 'Bunker Buster' GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb, which can only be launched by the US B-2 stealth bomber. A source confirmed that MOP was used in the operation, with each target hit by two bombs. However, a Pentagon official stated that three B-2 bombers participated in the attack, each carrying two MOPs. Additionally, the US military launched 30 Tomahawk missiles from a submarine, targeting Natanz and Esfahan nuclear facilities. White House officials stated that the US had notified Israel before the strike. Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu after the strike, and Netanyahu praised Trump's actions, stating 'Trump has consistently emphasized that strength leads to peace. Tonight, Trump has shown great strength with the US.' Iran had previously stated that if the US joined Israel's attack, it would retaliate. Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military targets on June 13, and Iran responded with missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities. A US intelligence official stated that 'we are in uncharted territory. We don't know how Iran will respond, as this is the most tense and intense conflict in modern times. We can't determine how the Hamani regime will respond.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 22, 2025 03:12 AM\nSource:[NOWnews \u4eca\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nownews.com/news/6698374)\n\n",

    "summary": "All ten experts, each drawing on distinct academic frameworks\u2014ranging from military strategy, intelligence analysis, and international relations theories to political science and Middle East studies\u2014forecast that the probability of a new country attacking Israel or Iran between June and December 2025 is low, though not zero. The consensus centers on several core reasons: \n\n- The historical base rate of new state entries into active Middle Eastern wars is extremely low, particularly after initial escalations and major power (US) intervention. \n- Regionally, states with conflicting interests (such as Gulf monarchies, Turkey, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon) overwhelmingly prefer indirect involvement through proxies or covert actions rather than overt, attributable attacks, due to fear of devastating retaliation and U.S. deterrence. \n- The overt involvement of the United States, explicit security guarantees, and demonstrated willingness by both Israel and Iran to retaliate massively serve as a powerful deterrent to new entrants.\n- Domestic constraints, regime survival instincts, and ongoing diplomatic and international pressure further disincentivize direct military action by third countries.\n- While some factors\u2014such as heightened regional polarization, the destructive precedent set by the June 2025 war, the possibility of miscalculation or accidental escalation, and historical rivalries\u2014slightly increase the risk, these are consistently outweighed by deterrence, the consequences observed in recent fighting, and the preference for proxy warfare.\n- The fine print, which excludes proxy or covert attacks unless they are overtly claimed or unambiguously attributed, further lowers the chance of a 'yes' outcome.\n\nIn sum, the most likely scenario is continued indirect and proxy activity; any overt, attributable attack by a new country would require extreme miscalculation, rogue action, or a black swan event. The individual expert probabilities range from 7% to 13%, with the central tendency (mean/median) around 10%. All forecasts emphasize that, although the regional environment is exceptionally volatile, the overwhelming pattern is for states to exercise restraint under these circumstances.",
