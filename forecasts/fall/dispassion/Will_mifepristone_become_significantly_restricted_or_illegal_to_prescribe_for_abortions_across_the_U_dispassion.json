The relevant lawsuits (e.g., Missouri v. FDA) have been slow-moving, and the Supreme Court's 2024 ruling and the structure of legal challenges make a nationwide ban before January 2026 procedurally difficult. The FDA's ongoing safety review could, under heavy political pressure, result in new restrictions, but given the extensive safety record and lack of credible new adverse evidence, this remains unlikely. The Comstock Act could theoretically be used to restrict distribution, but would face immediate legal challenge and delays. Congressional action is highly improbable within the timeframe. The requirement that the restriction be nationwide and in effect by January 1, 2026, sets a high bar. Base rates for nationwide bans of long-approved FDA drugs for political reasons are extremely low.

While the political climate is volatile and the Comstock Act is a theoretical risk, the actual mechanisms for rapid, nationwide, effective restriction are exceptionally constrained.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nMifepristone is a medication approved in the US for medical abortion and the management of Cushing's syndrome. As a progesterone receptor antagonist, it blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone critical for maintaining pregnancy. When used in combination with misoprostol, mifepristone effectively terminates early pregnancies by inducing uterine contractions and expelling the pregnancy tissue.\n\nIn 2024, the Republican Study Committee proposed a federal budget that [endorsed prohibiting mifepristone](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/22/fact-sheet-house-republicans-endorse-a-national-abortion-ban-with-zero-exceptions-in-latest-budget/), however as of January 2025 this has not been yet enacted. In 2023, [a suit was filed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDA_v._Alliance_for_Hippocratic_Medicine) by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, seeking to restrict access to mifepristone. A preliminary injunction suspending the approval of mifepristone, but this was never enacted as it was partially reverted by the Fifth Circuit and then reversed by the Supreme Court in 2024.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":31324,\"question_id\":30959}}`",

The FDA's approval, which follows a four-year application process, allows a lower-cost generic version of the drug\u2014used to terminate pregnancies up to 10 weeks\u2014to be marketed. The move was criticized by conservative figures, including Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who stated he 'has lost confidence in the leadership at the FDA,' and by Students for Life Action, which called the approval 'a stain on Trump\u2019s presidency and another sign that the deep state at the FDA must go.' Despite this, FDA officials emphasized they have 'very limited discretion' in approving generic drugs and do not endorse any specific product. The approval comes amid growing pressure on top Trump administration health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, to reevaluate mifepristone\u2019s safety\u2014despite decades of scientific consensus affirming its safety and efficacy. In a letter to Republican attorneys general, Kennedy and Makary committed to a comprehensive review of the drug. The original mifepristone was approved in 2000, with the first generic version (GenBioPro) approved in 2019. In 2021, under President Joe Biden, the FDA expanded access by allowing online prescriptions and mail delivery. The approval of a second generic version is unlikely to significantly alter access, as mifepristone is typically used with misoprostol\u2014accounting for about two-thirds of U.S. abortions. Misoprostol induces uterine contractions, while mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks progesterone. However, access remains restricted in many states due to abortion bans or specific restrictions on the drug, leading to ongoing legal challenges. These restrictions are not supported by major medical associations, including the American Medical Association.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Univision](https://www.univision.com/noticias/salud/la-fda-aprueba-otra-pildora-abortiva-generica-y-desata-indignacion-entre-los-conservadores)\n\n**U.S. Approves New Generic Abortion Pill, Sparking Conservative Outcry**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, prompting strong backlash from conservative and anti-abortion groups. The drug, developed by Evita, is approved for use up to 70 days of gestation and is part of a medication abortion regimen typically combined with misoprostol. This approval follows the original 2000 FDA approval of mifepristone and is a standard regulatory process for drugs with expired patents. Anti-abortion organizations, including Students for Life Action and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, condemned the decision, with Marjorie Dannenfelser calling it 'irresponsible' and 'unacceptable.' Republican Senator Josh Hawley expressed loss of confidence in the FDA, while former President Mike Pence accused the move of being a 'total betrayal' of the pro-life movement and demanded the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump\u2019s health advisor. The controversy comes amid a broader legal battle: in 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine that anti-abortion groups lacked standing to challenge the drug\u2019s regulation, affirming the FDA\u2019s authority. The FDA\u2019s approval process included compliance with the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program to ensure safe use. Advocates for reproductive rights, including the American Medical Association and Reproductive Freedom for All, praised the decision as evidence-based, emphasizing the drug\u2019s proven safety and efficacy. The approval may lower costs for medication abortion, though its real-world impact depends on state laws, existing restrictions, and potential court orders limiting distribution. Legal challenges continue in states with restrictive abortion laws, where the enforceability of state bans against federally approved drugs remains under judicial review.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 01:19 AM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2025/10/03/eeuu-aprueban-nueva-pildora-generica-abortiva-y-provoca-ola-de-criticas-de-parte-de-conservadores/)\n\n**FDA Approves Another Generic Version of Abortion Pill, Sparking Outrage Among Conservatives**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, manufactured by Evita Solutions, marking a routine regulatory step that triggered immediate backlash from anti-abortion groups and Republican politicians aligned with former President Donald Trump.

The approval comes amid growing pressure on top Trump administration health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F.

Under President Joe Biden, the FDA expanded access in 2021 by allowing online prescriptions and mail delivery, a move opposed by anti-abortion advocates. Generic drug approvals are typically routine, requiring manufacturers to prove bioequivalence to the original drug.

Evita\u2019s website states it believes 'all people should have access to safe, affordable, high-quality, effective, and compassionate abortion care.' The approval of a second generic version is unlikely to significantly expand access, as mifepristone is used in combination with misoprostol, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. abortions. Mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks progesterone, while misoprostol causes uterine contractions and cramping. Access remains restricted in large parts of the U.S. due to state laws banning abortion\u2014especially medication abortion\u2014or imposing separate restrictions on mifepristone. These laws are currently under legal challenge.

Organizations such as Students for Life Action and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America condemned the decision, with Marjorie Dannenfelser calling it 'unacceptable' and Senator Josh Hawley stating he lost confidence in the FDA. Former President Mike Pence accused the agency of betraying the pro-life cause and called for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump\u2019s health advisor, amid ongoing scrutiny of the drug\u2019s safety. In contrast, reproductive rights advocates hailed the approval as a scientific victory. The American Medical Association reaffirmed mifepristone\u2019s 'extremely safe and effective' status and warned that restricting access would endanger public health. Reproductive Freedom for All emphasized the decision was based on evidence-based regulatory work. The FDA requires the new generic version to comply with the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program to ensure safe use. This approval comes amid ongoing legal battles over medical abortion in the U.S., including the Supreme Court\u2019s 2024 ruling in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, which upheld the FDA\u2019s regulatory authority by dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 standing. However, in states with strict abortion laws, legal challenges continue over whether state bans can override federally approved medications. The GenBioPro case is a prominent example. The generic version could lower costs and expand access, but its real-world effectiveness depends on state laws and pending judicial decisions. Experts stress that unequal access across states remains a major challenge, with some regions guaranteeing availability while others impose legislative vetoes and ongoing litigation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[El Diario - Manabita](https://www.eldiario.ec/mundo/ola-de-protestas-tras-la-aprobacion-de-una-nueva-pildora-abortiva-generica-en-ee-uu-03102025/)\n\n**FDA Approves Another Generic Abortion Pill, Sparking Outrage Among Conservatives**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, manufactured by Evita Solutions, marking a routine regulatory step that triggered immediate backlash from pro-life groups and Republican politicians aligned with former President Donald Trump.

In a letter to Republican attorneys general, Kennedy and Makary committed to a comprehensive review of the drug. The original mifepristone was approved in 2000, with the first generic version (GenBioPro) approved in 2019. In 2021, under President Joe Biden, the FDA expanded access by allowing online prescriptions and mail delivery. The approval of a second generic version is unlikely to significantly alter access, as mifepristone is typically used with misoprostol\u2014accounting for about two-thirds of U.S. abortions. Misoprostol induces uterine contractions, while mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks progesterone. However, access remains restricted in many states due to abortion bans or specific restrictions on the drug, leading to ongoing legal challenges. These restrictions are not supported by major medical associations, including the American Medical Association.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Univision](https://www.univision.com/noticias/salud/la-fda-aprueba-otra-pildora-abortiva-generica-y-desata-indignacion-entre-los-conservadores)\n\n**Republican fury after FDA approves abortion pill: 'Complete betrayal'**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new generic version of mifepristone, the abortion pill, on October 3, 2025, prompting strong backlash from Republican figures and anti-abortion groups. Evita Solutions, the drugmaker, announced the approval, which follows a four-year review period\u2014unusually long for a generic drug application. Former Vice President Mike Pence called the decision a 'complete betrayal of the pro-life movement' and demanded President Donald Trump reverse it, citing concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as Health Secretary. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley criticized the FDA for approving the drug despite its promise to conduct a safety review, calling it dangerous. Oklahoma Congressman Josh Brecheen labeled abortion 'murder' and cited a 22x higher complication rate than initially reported by the FDA. Anti-abortion activist Lila Rose condemned the approval, demanding Kennedy reverse the decision. In contrast, Reproductive Freedom for All praised the FDA's action, noting mifepristone has been safely used for over two decades in abortion and miscarriage care. The FDA and Health Secretary Kennedy had previously pledged a full review of mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and consistently deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists. The generic approval is not expected to significantly expand access, as mifepristone is used in combination with misoprostol, which causes uterine contractions. The approval underscores ongoing political and legal tensions over reproductive rights and federal drug regulation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/republican-fury-fda-approves-abortion-pill-10822292)\n\n**The Intersection of State and Federal Policies on Access to Medication Abortion Via Telehealth after Dobbs | KFF**\nAfter the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, the use of telehealth for medication abortion has become a focal point of legal and policy conflict between state and federal authorities. Mifepristone, approved by the FDA 25 years ago, is used in combination with misoprostol to safely terminate early pregnancies (up to 70 days or 10 weeks) with a 99.6% success rate and a less than 0.001% mortality rate. As of 2024, one in four U.S. abortions are obtained via telehealth, with about half of those involving providers in states with 'shield' laws mailing pills to patients in states with abortion bans or gestational limits. By July 2025, eight states had shield laws protecting providers from prosecution when delivering care legally in their state, regardless of patient location. However, Louisiana and Texas have sued New York doctors for mailing abortion pills into their states, with Texas issuing a default judgment and $100,000 fine against a physician, though New York\u2019s shield law has blocked enforcement. The federal government\u2019s potential enforcement of the 1873 Comstock Act\u2014banning the mailing of materials used for abortion\u2014could restrict nationwide access to mifepristone, though the Biden administration argues intent must be proven. The Trump administration, under Project 2025, has signaled intent to enforce the Act. The FDA is conducting a safety review of mifepristone under pressure from anti-abortion advocates, despite criticism of its methodology. Four citizen petitions have been filed with the FDA, and multiple lawsuits are ongoing: Missouri v. FDA seeks to reinstate in-person dispensing and three-visit requirements; Oregon and Washington, joined by 16 states, challenged FDA\u2019s REMS as unjustified barriers; GenBioPro sued to prevent suspension of FDA approval; and cases in West Virginia and North Carolina challenge state laws restricting telehealth and in-person dispensing, with the 4th Circuit upholding West Virginia\u2019s law. A Louisiana state court case challenges the state\u2019s reclassification of mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances. The legal landscape remains fluid, with federal and state courts actively shaping access to telehealth-based medication abortion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 02:21 AM\nSource:[KFF](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/the-intersection-of-state-and-federal-policies-on-access-to-medication-abortion-via-telehealth-after-dobbs/)\n\n**U.S. Approves New Generic Abortion Pill, Sparking Conservative Outcry**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, prompting strong backlash from conservative and anti-abortion groups. The drug, developed by Evita, is approved for use up to 70 days of gestation and is part of a medication abortion regimen typically combined with misoprostol. This approval follows the original 2000 FDA approval of mifepristone and is a standard regulatory process for drugs with expired patents. Anti-abortion organizations, including Students for Life Action and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, condemned the decision, with Marjorie Dannenfelser calling it 'irresponsible' and 'unacceptable.' Republican Senator Josh Hawley expressed loss of confidence in the FDA, while former President Mike Pence accused the move of being a 'total betrayal' of the pro-life movement and demanded the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump\u2019s health advisor. The controversy comes amid a broader legal battle: in 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine that anti-abortion groups lacked standing to challenge the drug\u2019s regulation, affirming the FDA\u2019s authority. The FDA\u2019s approval process included compliance with the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program to ensure safe use. Advocates for reproductive rights, including the American Medical Association and Reproductive Freedom for All, praised the decision as evidence-based, emphasizing the drug\u2019s proven safety and efficacy. The approval may lower costs for medication abortion, though its real-world impact depends on state laws, existing restrictions, and potential court orders limiting distribution. Legal challenges continue in states with restrictive abortion laws, where the enforceability of state bans against federally approved drugs remains under judicial review.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 01:19 AM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2025/10/03/eeuu-aprueban-nueva-pildora-generica-abortiva-y-provoca-ola-de-criticas-de-parte-de-conservadores/)\n\n**FDA Approves Second Generic Version of Abortion Pill, Sparking Conservative Backlash**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a second generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, manufactured by Evita Solutions, marking a routine regulatory step that triggered immediate backlash from anti-abortion groups and Republican politicians aligned with former President Donald Trump.

The new generic version, which is authorized for use in early pregnancies up to 10 weeks, follows the 2019 approval of the first generic version by GenBioPro. Critics, including Students for Life Action and Senator Josh Hawley, condemned the approval, with Hawley stating he 'has lost confidence in the leadership of the FDA.' The move comes amid ongoing pressure on top Trump administration health officials, including Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, who committed in a letter to a comprehensive safety review of mifepristone. Despite the controversy, the FDA typically approves generic drugs within 10 months after patent expiration, though Evita Solutions submitted its application four years ago. Evita Solutions claims its mission is to ensure 'safe, affordable, high-quality, effective, and compassionate abortion care' for all. The approval of a second generic is unlikely to significantly alter access, as mifepristone is used in combination with misoprostol, which accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. abortions.

Evita Solutions, which aims to 'normalize abortion care' and make it 'accessible to all,' becomes the second manufacturer authorized to sell a generic version after GenBioPro\u2019s 2019 approval. The drug, originally marketed as Mifeprex by Danco Laboratories, is used in nearly two-thirds of U.S. abortions and works by blocking progesterone to prevent the maintenance of the uterine lining, followed by misoprostol to complete the process. The FDA\u2019s approval, which occurred amid a broader Trump administration review of mifepristone\u2019s safety regulations, sparked swift backlash from conservative groups and lawmakers. Students for Life Action called the approval 'a stain on the Trump presidency,' while Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) stated he had 'lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.' The approval comes after the 2021 and 2023 revisions to the drug\u2019s risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, which expanded access to telehealth prescribing and mail delivery, increasing the use window from 7 to 10 weeks of pregnancy.

The lawsuit, originally filed in 2022 by anti-abortion activists and doctors, was joined by Idaho, Missouri, and Kansas\u2014states that lacked jurisdictional ties to Amarillo, Texas, where the case was initially filed. Kacsmaryk ruled that dismissing the case would force plaintiffs to restart from 'square one' and sever connections between the states and original plaintiffs. The Supreme Court previously dismissed the original lawsuit in 2024 on standing grounds, finding the conservative doctors had not demonstrated personal harm from FDA regulations. However, the Supreme Court did not rule on the drug\u2019s safety or regulatory merits. The red states argue that relaxed FDA rules have allowed mifepristone to cross state lines, endangering women and undermining anti-abortion laws. The states seek to limit mifepristone use to pregnancies under seven weeks and require three in-person doctor visits, while also challenging the approval of generic versions. GenBioPro, the maker of generic mifepristone, joined as a defendant in April and criticized the lawsuit as 'politically motivated,' asserting that mifepristone has been FDA-approved for 25 years under rigorous standards and that restricting access would infringe on reproductive rights and endanger public health. Over 7.5 million Americans have used mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage care since its approval. The case\u2019s transfer to Missouri opens the possibility of a ruling on the drug\u2019s regulatory status, potentially reinstating prior restrictions or revoking approval. The Department of Health and Human Services is currently reviewing mifepristone\u2019s safety regulations, while the FDA maintains that mifepristone, when used with misoprostol, is a safe and effective alternative to surgical abortion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 04:43 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5531327-mifepristone-lawsuit-transferred-missouri/)\n\n**Post-Dobbs Reproductive Health Care Provider Considerations | Practical Law The Journal | Reuters**\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the legality of abortion has been returned to the states, creating a complex and evolving legal landscape for reproductive health care providers. Providers must navigate state-specific laws on abortion, including medication abortion via telehealth, as well as federal policies under the Biden and Trump administrations. Key developments include the 2024 Final HIPAA Regulations, which prohibited uses and disclosures of protected health information (PHI) related to lawful reproductive health care, but were vacated in June 2025 by a Texas district court in Purl v. HHS, which ruled that HHS exceeded its authority. The Supreme Court later affirmed the vacatur in July 2025. Under EMTALA, federal courts have ruled that states cannot prohibit emergency abortions when necessary to stabilize a patient, as seen in Idaho (United States v. Idaho, Moyle v. United States) and Texas (Texas v. Becerra). In Idaho, a hospital (St. Luke's Health System) obtained a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the state\u2019s abortion ban when it conflicts with EMTALA-mandated emergency care. The FDA\u2019s 2023 approval of mifepristone (the abortion pill) under a REMS program has faced multiple legal challenges. The Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine sued to remove mifepristone from the market, leading to a nationwide preliminary injunction in April 2023, which was stayed by the Supreme Court. In June 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing, returning the case to lower courts. The case continues with Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho as intervenor plaintiffs. The Fifth Circuit upheld restrictions on mifepristone distribution, including requiring in-person visits and limiting use to seven weeks. The FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2023 changes allowing telehealth prescriptions and pharmacy certification remain in effect. State-level challenges continue: Washington and 16 other states sued to remove REMS restrictions, but the court granted summary judgment in favor of the FDA in July 2025. Providers face significant risks, including criminal and civil liability in states that ban abortion, potential licensing repercussions across states, and malpractice insurance limitations. Some states, such as California, New York, and New Jersey, have enacted protections for providers and patients. Providers must also consider the definition of personhood in certain states, where life is defined at fertilization or heartbeat, potentially enabling wrongful death claims. The article emphasizes that providers must assess state laws, federal guidance, and ongoing litigation to manage legal and operational risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 04:06 AM\nSource:[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/practical-law-the-journal/transactional/post-dobbs-reproductive-health-care-provider-considerations-2025-10-01/)\n\n**On its 25th birthday, mifepristone is more under attack than ever**\nOn its 25th anniversary, the FDA\u2011approved abortion drug mifepristone faces intensified attacks from anti\u2011abortion Republicans who seek to revoke its approval and impose new restrictions. The drug, first approved in France in 1990 and in the U.S. on Sept.\u202f28,\u202f2000, has enabled at\u2011home abortions by blocking progesterone and, together with misoprostol, expelling the pregnancy. In 2016 the FDA extended its use to 10\u202fweeks, and in December\u202f2021 the Biden administration allowed remote prescribing, increasing accessibility. Despite the 2022 Supreme Court Dobbs decision, mifepristone\u2019s use has grown: medication abortion now accounts for more than 60\u202f% of all U.S. abortions, with one in four abortions performed via telehealth and half of those telehealth abortions occurring under shield laws that protect providers in blue states. Anti\u2011abortion groups, including some Trump\u2011era officials, have cited a right\u2011wing report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center that claims higher complication rates, but experts note the study\u2019s lack of peer review and unclear methodology. The HHS and FDA announced a new review after a letter from Republican attorneys general. State\u2011level efforts include Louisiana\u2019s classification of the drugs as controlled substances and Texas\u2019s bill allowing private citizens to sue anyone who distributes or prescribes them for at least $100,000. Advocacy voices such as Kelly Baden of the Guttmacher Institute and Danika Severino Wynn of Planned Parenthood argue that mifepristone is safe, effective, and essential for reproductive autonomy, warning that \u201canti\u2011abortion policymakers and activists are escalating attacks on medication abortion to continue their crusade against abortion for anyone and at any time through shoddy science, medically unnecessary restrictions, and punitive lawsuits and legislation.\u201d\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 08:04 PM\nSource:[Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/on-its-25th-birthday-mifepristone-abortion-pill-is-more-under-attack-than-ever/)\n\n**FDA Review of Mifepristone Under Scrutiny**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is set to conduct a new review of the safety and effectiveness of mifepristone, a medication approved in 2000 for terminating pregnancies up to 10 weeks gestation. In a letter sent on September 19 to 22 Republican attorneys general, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary wrote, 'This Government will ensure the proper protection of women\u2019s health by thoroughly investigating the circumstances in which mifepristone can be dispensed safely.' The review comes amid concerns that tighter restrictions could limit access, especially as telehealth and mail\u2011delivery services have expanded use in rural areas. Opponents of abortion have argued that the drug is 'not safe' and have pushed for it to be limited to in\u2011person consultations. The FDA maintains that mifepristone has been safe and effective for over two decades, with only five deaths per million users\u2014 a mortality rate of 0.0005\u202f%\u2014 comparable to common analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has repeatedly called for broader access. The landscape of abortion access changed dramatically after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision in 2022, which removed federal protection; since then 20 states have imposed restrictions or bans, while others have enacted new protections. Telehealth has played a key role: according to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2024 more than one million abortions were performed in a single year, with about 14\u202f% occurring in exclusively online clinics\u2014 up from 10\u202f% in 2023. During a Senate hearing, Kennedy said the Biden administration had 'misrepresented the safety data' on mifepristone, though he offered no details, adding, 'We receive data all the time: new data that we are reviewing.' The outcome of the FDA review will hinge on this evaluation and the political pressures in a country where abortion remains one of the most polarizing issues.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 05:23 AM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2025/09/26/farmaco-abortivo-bajo-la-lupa-fda-analiza-posibles-riesgos/)\n\n**U.S. Federal Agencies Investigate Safety of Mifepristone, Drug Used for Abortion**\nU.S. federal agencies, led by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are reviewing the safety and efficacy of mifepristone, a medication used for medical abortion.

They wrote, 'Este Gobierno garantizar\u00e1 la protecci\u00f3n adecuada de la salud de las mujeres investigando exhaustivamente las circunstancias en las que la mifepristona puede dispensarse de forma segura.' The letter has raised concerns among abortion\u2011rights advocates, who fear new federal restrictions could limit access to the drug, which has been available since 2000 and is authorized for use up to 10 weeks of gestation. FDA data show only five deaths per million users\u2014 a mortality rate of 0.0005%\u2014 comparable to over\u2011the\u2011counter pain relievers. Kennedy told Senate Finance Committee that the Biden administration had 'tergiversado los datos' to hide a safety warning, and that studies are 'progresando y que est\u00e1n en curso.' The FDA\u2019s review follows a Supreme Court decision in June 2024 that prevented a ban on the drug but left open the possibility of future regulatory changes. In 2024, more than one million abortions were performed in the United States, with 14% occurring in clinics that operate exclusively online\u2014 up from 10% in 2023, an increase of roughly 40,000 abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

Texas and Florida contend that Missouri, Kansas and Idaho may no longer adequately represent Republican\u2011led states because Missouri\u2019s abortion regulations were blocked by a 2024 constitutional amendment and Idaho\u2019s ban could be reversed in a 2026 referendum. Kansas is also seen as weak after its Supreme Court affirmed a broad constitutional right to abortion. The states also cite New York\u2019s shield laws that enable mail\u2011order mifepristone, which they say threatens their abortion policies. The lawsuit challenges FDA actions from 2016 and 2021 that expanded medication abortions to 10 weeks of pregnancy (up from seven) and allowed mail delivery without an in\u2011person clinician visit. The case began under the Biden administration, but President Trump has defended the FDA\u2019s decisions. A 2024 Supreme Court ruling rejected a bid to restrict the drug, and U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, allowed Missouri, Kansas and Idaho to continue the lawsuit. Texas and Florida\u2019s filing states: 'We need to step in to protect our abortion policies from other states, like New York, that have passed shield laws that enable patients to get mail\u2011order mifepristone in other states.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 23, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/texas-florida-seek-to-join-legal-challenge-to-abortion-pill-4207834)\n\n**Texas, Florida seek to join legal challenge to abortion pill**\nTexas and Florida filed a motion in federal court on August 22, 2025, asking to join a lawsuit led by Missouri, Kansas and Idaho that seeks to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone.

The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled that the FDA's approval of Mifepristone does not supersede the West Virginia law on medication abortions. Medication abortions account for more than half of all abortions in the US. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote that a 2007 federal law, which gives the FDA more authority over 'high-risk' medications, does not clearly indicate an intention to override the traditional right of states to protect the health and safety of their citizens. Wilkinson also saw no indication that Congress intended to guarantee a nationwide access to Mifepristone. 'The debate, led by able and dedicated advocates and opponents of access to abortion medication, is simply not the one that this court should decide without clear congressional guidance,' the judge wrote for the 2-1 majority. The decision on Tuesday is the first of a US appeals court that allows states to restrict the use of the pill. In June 2024, the US Supreme Court had preserved access to Mifepristone and rejected a lawsuit by abortion opponents seeking to overturn the FDA's approval. The West Virginia law was challenged by GenBioPro, a Nevada-based company that sells a generic version of Mifepristone. Opponents of the law warned that its survival could enable other states to criminalize access to FDA-approved medications. 'The law creates a dangerous precedent for access to other evidence-based medical treatments that the FDA has deemed safe and effective,' said Skye Perryman, president of the non-profit organization Democracy Forward, which supported GenBioPro in the case. West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, who defended the law as the state's attorney general, called the decision a 'great victory' that would allow West Virginia to 'take a leading role in protecting life nationwide.' With the decision on Tuesday, a ruling by US District Judge Robert Chambers from Huntington, West Virginia, from August 2023 was confirmed. Mifepristone is the first tablet, followed by Misoprostol, used for medication abortions in the first ten weeks of pregnancy and was approved by the FDA in 2000. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health organization, 28 states restrict access to medication abortions. The 'Unborn Child Protection Act' of West Virginia prohibits abortions with few exceptions, including within the first 14 weeks of pregnancy for minors who were victims of rape or incest. Wilkinson emphasized that federal courts should not impose their own political views on the decisions of lawmakers at the state level without evaluating the law. He also said that overturning the law would be equivalent to a 'near-open disregard' of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling, in which the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the nationwide right to abortion. 'Just after the Supreme Court returned the authority to regulate abortion to the states, GenBioPro wants us to take it away from them immediately,' Wilkinson wrote. 'In a time when the rule of law is being severely attacked, ignoring the Supreme Court is not an option,' he added. Wilkinson was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. His opinion was supported by US District Judge Rossie Alston, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, who normally operates in Alexandria, Virginia. Appeals Judge DeAndrea Gist Benjamin, a Democrat appointed by President Joe Biden, dissented and said that the West Virginia law 'erects barriers to lifesaving medical care for countless residents of West Virginia in a way that Congress did not intend.' She added that the law could further burden patients in medically underserved areas, forcing them to travel to other states for treatment. The case is GenBioPro Inc v Raynes et al, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-2194.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 02:22 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/nachrichten/US-Berufungsgericht-bestatigt-Abtreibungsverbot-und-Einschrankungen-fur-Mifepriston-in-West-Virgi-50513561/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert domains\u2014law (FDA regulatory, constitutional, federalism, judicial precedent), health policy, political science, and public health\u2014the consensus is that the probability of mifepristone becoming significantly restricted or illegal to prescribe for abortions nationwide before January 1, 2026, is low but not zero. Forecasters nearly unanimously cite the extremely short time frame remaining (about 3 months), the robust status quo (including recent FDA approval of a new generic), slow-moving and procedural regulatory/administrative law, and the high inertia and legal complexity of enacting fast, sweeping national restrictions. Experts note ongoing litigation by red states and heavy Republican political pressure, as well as hypothetical executive actions (e.g., aggressive enforcement of the Comstock Act or emergency FDA suspension). However, all stress that (a) the Supreme Court's 2024 decision affirmed FDA authority and standing barriers; (b) lawsuits like Missouri v. FDA are unlikely to reach final, nationally enforceable decisions or avoid appellate stays before the deadline; and (c) FDA administrative reviews or rulemakings are procedurally slow and subject to legal challenge. Congressional action is viewed as virtually impossible in the time left. While an unforeseen emergency court injunction or executive order is theoretically possible, experts assign this only a low, residual probability. Probability estimates range from 4% to 12%, with a central cluster around 6-8%. The unified reason is that base rates for abrupt, nationwide bans or restrictions on long-approved FDA drugs are extraordinarily low, and nothing in the present legal, regulatory, or political environment indicates a strong likelihood of overcoming systemic inertia before 2026.",
