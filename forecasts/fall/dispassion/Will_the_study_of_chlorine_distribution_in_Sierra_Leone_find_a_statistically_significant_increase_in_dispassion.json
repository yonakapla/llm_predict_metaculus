The arguments from African Studies and WASH/behavior change specialists strengthen the case for caution, but no new evidence or argument suggests a need to significantly move the forecast up or down. Thus, my original 75% remains well-calibrated: bold but not maximal, balancing technical strength with context-specific uncertainty.",

The original question opened on 2024-10-23 16:00:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/28371). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nIn May 2024, GiveWell made a [grant](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#Internal_forecasts) to Wageningen University to add delivery of chlorine for disinfecting drinking water to a bundle of health services that is being delivered door-to-door in Sierra Leone, as part of a cluster-randomized controlled trial. This trial will study whether this distribution of chlorine will lead to a statistically significant increase in chlorine usage:\n\n>The study will be a cluster-randomized [randomized controlled trial] in which the treatment communities receive household-to-household visits from health teams offering routine childhood and HPV vaccines to those who have not received all of the vaccines in the vaccination schedule. Households with children under the age of 5 will also be offered VAS, deworming pills, chlorine to treat drinking water, and ORS/zinc to treat future diarrhea episodes [[1](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#footnote1)]. Control communities will not receive any interventions [[2](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#footnote2)]. The health teams will also provide information on when young children are due for subsequent vaccines [[3](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#footnote3)]. The health teams will return after three months and provide the same bundle of services [[4](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#footnote4)].\n\n>Data on vaccination, VAS, and deworming uptake will be collected at the same time as delivery at both the initial visit and the 3-month follow-up visit, and simultaneously in control communities [[5](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#footnote5)]. At the 3-month visit, households will also be asked about use of chlorine and ORS/zinc, and the survey team will test household water for chlorine [[6](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#footnote6)]. Chlorine and ORS/zinc usage will be measured just at the 3-month visit, as unlike the other commodities, take-up of these products cannot be measured right away [[7](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#footnote7)]. \n\nAs of May 2024, the estimated usage of chlorine in these communities was about 8% and the study is powered to detect a minimum effect size of 5 percentage points. If that increase in chlorine use was achieved, it would mean at least 13% usage in the treatment group. GiveWell's internal forecasting offers a probability of 80% that the study will measure a statistically significant increase in chlorine usage in the treatment group, combined over two rounds of distribution.\n\nAccording to [the grant rationale](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#The_case_for_the_grant), GiveWell has high confidence in the research team and thinks they will be able to achieve the sample size needed to detect effects in chlorine usage. GiveWell\u2019s reservations about the potential outcomes include:\n\n- Recipients may be overwhelmed by the quantity of health services being received in the door-to-door visits and may not process all the instructions.\n- Recipients may view oral rehydration solution and chlorine as substitutes for each other.\n- People in areas with very little contact with health authorities might not react to the health information in ways that researchers would hope.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":28371,\"question_id\":28371}}`",

A major breakthrough in HIV prevention is emerging with lenacapavir, an injectable drug administered twice yearly that reduces HIV transmission risk by over 99.9%. Winnie Byanyima of UNAIDS warns that U.S. funding cuts threaten progress, but she sees lenacapavir as a transformative tool for low-income African countries, with rollout planned for 2027. In response to the withdrawal of U.S. aid, the Madagascar Foundation launched an ambitious $400 million hospital ship project, with $40 million annual operating costs, to serve East Africa from Mozambique to Kenya. The ship will be supported by mobile medical convoys. Research on Ebola Sudan shows the virus can persist for months post-infection, with 57.5% of survivors reporting persistent symptoms two years later, including musculoskeletal, neurological, and vision issues. Viral RNA was detected in semen up to 210 days and in breast milk up to 199 days, raising concerns about sexual and mother-to-child transmission. The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s Kasai region shows signs of slowing, with no new cases since September 30, 64 cumulative cases (53 confirmed, 11 probable), 42 deaths (64.5% lethality), and over 8,000 vaccinated. The WHO and partners need $66.6 million to support the national response. Cholera cases in Africa are projected to exceed 300,000 by end-2025\u2014three times 2022 levels\u2014with a 2.1% fatality rate. Kenya and Zambia report rising mpox cases, with clade 1b spreading to Nairobi and high positivity in Copperbelt, Muchinga, and Lusaka provinces; the WHO downgraded mpox to non-urgent status on September 5, 2025, citing sustained global decline, but emphasized continued vigilance. Ethiopia\u2019s Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority (EFDA) achieved WHO Maturity Level 3 (ML3), joining nine other African nations in having a robust regulatory system. In Togo, MA SANT\u00c9 medical center was suspended for 12 months due to fraud in the Universal Health Insurance scheme, with repayment required. Sierra Leone received $456,000 in WHO medical supplies to enhance antimicrobial surveillance. Ghana received emergency medical aid for conflict-affected areas in the Savannah Region. Benin launched training on the e-PHEM digital emergency management platform, becoming the seventh West African country to adopt it. Mauritius launched a national cardiac registry to combat cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in 2021, driven by diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and smoking.

However, no statistically significant benefit was observed when the age range was expanded to children younger than 9 years, with a 15-percentage-point increase (from 43% to 58%). The pooled VE for one dose of IIV was 14% for children under 3 years and 35% for those up to 8 years. For live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), pooled one-dose VE was 26%, similar to one-dose IIV VE (35%), but second-dose LAIV efficacy was significantly higher at 82%. The authors noted that the difference in efficacy between LAIV and IIV may reflect seasonal antigenic variation rather than inherent vaccine superiority. Most studies (23 of 28) categorized children as partially or fully vaccinated rather than by dose count, with pooled VE of 32% for partial vaccination and 43% for full vaccination. The researchers emphasized that few randomized controlled trials assessed the protection of one versus two doses in the same population and that many observational studies were at high risk of bias due to misclassification. They concluded that the second IIV dose provides meaningful additional protection for vaccine-naive children under 3, but the benefit diminishes with age, and more high-quality studies are needed to determine the optimal age range for a two-dose schedule for both vaccine types.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 08:32 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/second-flu-vaccine-dose-boosts-protection-young-vaccine-naive-kids-analysis)\n\n**Multivaccination Campaign Begins in Juiz de Fora for Children and Adolescents Up to 15 Years Old**\nThe city of Juiz de Fora, through its Secretariat of Health (SS), will launch the Multivaccination Campaign on Monday, October 6, 2025, targeting children and adolescents up to 15 years old.

The study included 50 postmenopausal women who met inclusion criteria: amenorrhea for at least 12 months or serum follicle-stimulating hormone >30 mIU/mL, along with symptoms such as vaginal dryness, burning, itching, pain, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Exclusion criteria included history of gynecological or breast cancer, pelvic organ prolapse, recent use of vaginal products or douching (within 3 months), or hormone therapy (within 6 months). Participants were randomly assigned to two groups of 25: Group 1 received zinc sulfate-containing pessaries, and Group 2 received placebo pessaries, both administered vaginally before bedtime for 14 consecutive nights. Pessaries were identical in appearance, using a glycerol-gelatine base, with zinc sulfate and lactic acid incorporated into the active group. Randomization codes were managed by an independent pharmacy at Cairo University, and blinding was maintained for participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for symptom severity (0\u201310), the Vaginal Health Index (VHI) for elasticity, secretion, pH, epithelial mucosa, and hydration (1\u20135, lower = worse), and the Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) calculated as [(1\u00d7%superficial) + (0.5\u00d7%intermediate) + (0\u00d7%parabasal)]. Assessments were performed before and after treatment. A satisfaction questionnaire was administered two weeks post-treatment.

The campaign uses a single-dose vaccine, which has been proven effective in preventing HPV infection. Dr. Justice Ofori-Amoah, District Health Director, emphasized the importance of protecting girls to prevent future cervical cancer cases. Gideon Asare, District Disease Control Officer, highlighted collaboration with schools, community leaders, and healthcare providers to ensure full coverage. The district has conducted cervical cancer screenings since August 2024, testing 126 individuals with only one positive result, underscoring the value of prevention over detection. Public Health Nurse Nancy Osei Owusu stated that while screening helps identify the virus, vaccination offers superior protection by preventing exposure. Dr. Kingsley Adeoye, Medical Officer at Effiduase Government Hospital, advised women to seek medical attention for symptoms such as unusual vaginal bleeding, persistent pelvic pain, or abnormal discharge. Globally, cervical cancer causes over 350,000 deaths annually, with Ghana recording about 1,700 deaths and nearly 3,000 new cases each year. In Sekyere East, where access to advanced cancer treatment is limited, the vaccination campaign is viewed as a critical, life-saving intervention to reduce future fatalities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 08:39 AM\nSource:[MyJoyOnline.com](https://www.myjoyonline.com/sekyere-east-launches-hpv-vaccination-campaign-to-protect-over-6000-girls/)\n\n**TFM Supports Local Livestock Initiatives to Promote Community Development**\nTenke Fungurume Mining (TFM) continues its community development initiatives by supporting local livestock farming, particularly goat rearing, as part of its broader strategy to diversify income sources for host communities. The company recently launched its third phase of goat distribution, delivering a total of 368 goats to 111 beneficiaries since the project began in late 2023. Of these, 260 goats were distributed to 79 farmers in the commune of Fungurume, and 108 goats were sent to 32 beneficiaries in villages of the Bayeke chiefdom. Each recipient received three goats. Before distribution, TFM ensures all animals are vaccinated and provides ongoing technical support for one year, including regular visits, deworming, and veterinary supplies. According to Jovial Mibanga, TFM\u2019s veterinarian, the program operates under a 'm\u00e9tayage' solidarity model: after one year, each beneficiary must return three goats, which are then redistributed to new families. This mechanism promotes sustainable herd growth and long-term community impact. Beneficiaries such as Nicole Kayombo and Kabina Maria praised the initiative, highlighting its role in improving household income, supporting children\u2019s education, and enabling social transformation, particularly for women.

The advisory emphasizes that most acute cough illnesses in children are self-limiting and do not require pharmacological treatment. It explicitly advises against prescribing cough and cold medications for children under two years and discourages their use in children under five, stating that any use above age five must involve careful clinical evaluation, strict adherence to dosing, shortest effective duration, and avoidance of multiple drug combinations. The advisory promotes non-pharmacological measures such as 'adequate hydration and rest' as first-line treatment. It also mandates that health facilities procure and dispense products made under Good Manufacturing Practices with pharmaceutical-grade excipients. While tests on samples from Madhya Pradesh found no Diethylene Glycol (DEG) or Ethylene Glycol (EG), and samples from Rajasthan showed no Propylene Glycol, the Union Health Ministry stated that the products were dextromethorphan-based formulations, which are not recommended for pediatric use. This follows a 2022 global alert by the World Health Organization after 66 deaths in The Gambia were linked to contaminated cough syrups from a Haryana-based manufacturer. The usual cause of toxicity is the substitution of industrial-grade glycerine or propylene glycol for pharmaceutical-grade versions, which can lead to acute kidney injury and death. In July 2024, over 100 pharmaceutical units across India failed quality control tests for cough syrups.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 04:18 AM\nSource:[Scroll.in](https://scroll.in/latest/1087291/health-ministry-advisory-calls-for-rational-use-of-cough-syrups-for-children)\n\n**Surge in FIVE viruses fuel fears hospitals could become overwhelmed**\nThe UK faces a potential 'quin-demic'\u2014a simultaneous surge in five winter viruses: Covid-19, influenza (flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, and norovirus\u2014raising concerns that the NHS could become overwhelmed. Two new Covid variants, Stratus and Nimbus, are driving a rise in infections, with cases doubling since August. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported a rise in Covid test positivity from 7.6% to 8.4% in one week and hospitalisations increasing from 2.0 to 2.7 per 100,000 people. Flu cases are rising earlier than usual, with positive tests in children aged 5\u201314 more than doubling from 1.9 to 4.1 per 100,000 after the return to school. RSV cases rose from 0.27 to 0.44 per 100,000 between mid-September, rhinovirus cases increased from 8.5 to 14.8 per 100,000, and norovirus remains a concern despite low current levels. Professor Lawrence Young of Warwick University warned that without high vaccination uptake, a dual wave of flu and Covid could severely strain the NHS, leading to longer wait times, cancelled surgeries, and worsening delays on already record-breaking waiting lists. He urged people to take flu, RSV, and Covid jabs when offered and to stay home when unwell. The NHS advises seeking medical help if symptoms persist beyond 10 days, worsen, include chest pain, severe breathlessness, confusion, or difficulty feeding in children, or occur in individuals with long-term health conditions or weakened immune systems. The winter vaccination campaign is underway, targeting over-75s, care home residents, pregnant women, those with weakened immune systems, and children\u2014including toddlers now eligible for nasal spray flu vaccines at community pharmacies. Some high street chemists offer private Covid jabs for up to \u00a399.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15158571/covid-rsv-norovirus-flu-quindemic-NHS-winter-fears.html)\n\n**Second flu vaccine dose boosts protection in young, vaccine-naive kids, analysis suggests**\nA meta-analysis of 51 studies involving 415,050 vaccine-naive children aged 6 months to 8 years, published in JAMA Network Open on October 3, 2025, found that a second dose of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) significantly increases vaccine effectiveness (VE) by 28 percentage points (from 52% to 80%) in children younger than 3 years. However, no statistically significant benefit was observed when the age range was expanded to children younger than 9 years, with a 15-percentage-point increase (from 43% to 58%). The pooled VE for one dose of IIV was 14% for children under 3 years and 35% for those up to 8 years. For live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), pooled one-dose VE was 26%, similar to one-dose IIV VE (35%), but second-dose LAIV efficacy was significantly higher at 82%. The authors noted that the difference in efficacy between LAIV and IIV may reflect seasonal antigenic variation rather than inherent vaccine superiority. Most studies (23 of 28) categorized children as partially or fully vaccinated rather than by dose count, with pooled VE of 32% for partial vaccination and 43% for full vaccination. The researchers emphasized that few randomized controlled trials assessed the protection of one versus two doses in the same population and that many observational studies were at high risk of bias due to misclassification. They concluded that the second IIV dose provides meaningful additional protection for vaccine-naive children under 3, but the benefit diminishes with age, and more high-quality studies are needed to determine the optimal age range for a two-dose schedule for both vaccine types.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 08:32 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/second-flu-vaccine-dose-boosts-protection-young-vaccine-naive-kids-analysis)\n\n**Zim steps up immunisation drive to protect every child under five - ZBC NEWS**\nZimbabwe is intensifying its immunisation drive to ensure all children under five receive routine vaccines against preventable diseases such as measles, polio, and rubella, in partnership with development agencies. The national immunisation programme is recognized as one of the most effective public health interventions, having saved millions of lives. However, challenges persist due to religious beliefs, cultural practices, and the dispersed nature of rural communities. In Msengezi, Chegutu District, mother Violet Gonye shared that her family\u2019s religious opposition once prevented her children from being vaccinated, but after losing two children to illness, she now ensures her remaining six children are immunised. Some community members, particularly in remote and nomadic areas, remain vaccine-hesitant, with one stating, 'I don\u2019t believe in vaccines, and I don\u2019t intend to take any of my children to the clinic,' while another said, 'We have our own ways to deal with diseases, using cooking oil, cotton wool, and prayers for measles.' To address these barriers, health workers are implementing innovative outreach strategies, including facility outreaches and home visits. Ms Wadzanai Dumba, Sister-in-Charge at Mupfure Clinic, noted that parents often miss appointments due to work or distance. Village health workers play a crucial role in tracking missed vaccinations and promoting immunisation. Ms Anna Chigodo, a Community Health Worker, said a measles and rubella campaign is currently underway from the 6th to the 10th of October. With support from partners like Crown Agents, the government is strengthening vaccination systems, expanding outreach, and training more health workers. Dr Sandra Mhuriro, Chegutu District Medical Officer, highlighted the success of the zero-dose project, which operates in 24 facilities and involves trained village workers collaborating with local leaders and herdsmen to educate communities and refer unvaccinated children. The overarching goal remains to ensure every child in Zimbabwe receives timely access to life-saving vaccines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 01:08 PM\nSource:[zbcnews.co.zw](https://www.zbcnews.co.zw/zim-steps-up-immunisation-drive-to-protect-every-child-under-five/)\n\n**Snapshot on nutrition awareness, behaviors and practices among Galkayo IDPs**\nDevelopment and Empowerment for Humanity (DEH) conducted a comprehensive assessment of nutrition awareness, behaviors, and practices among 273 households in Galkayo, Somalia, focusing on pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children under five. Findings revealed that PLW are a high-risk group, consistent with national trends of high fertility (6.2 births per woman) and low female literacy (26%). Children under two years dominated the sample, emphasizing the need for targeted infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and early nutrition interventions. Nutritional assessment showed 14.4% of children were acutely malnourished, primarily infants and younger toddlers. Breastfeeding practices were strong, with 96% of infants under six months still breastfeeding and 80% exclusively breastfed, though early initiation and sustained breastfeeding beyond 24 months remained weak. Complementary feeding practices showed limited dietary diversity, reliance on carbohydrate-rich staples, and frequent meal skipping. Child health and WASH indicators revealed mixed progress: institutional delivery and skilled attendance were high (77.7% and 76.9%, respectively), but antenatal care (ANC) attendance was low (51.6%), with many mothers initiating visits late. Immunization and supplementation coverage declined after BCG, with low Vitamin A and deworming coverage. Morbidity was driven by fever and diarrhea, with suboptimal management practices. WASH conditions posed ongoing risks: 33.7% of households practiced open defecation, low household water treatment, inconsistent handwashing, and reliance on unprotected water sources. Household food insecurity affected one-third of households, with children in food-insecure homes more likely to be malnourished. Key findings showed a significant drop in acute malnutrition from nearly half at baseline to 14.4% at endline, suggesting programmatic or seasonal effects, though service utilization weakened over time\u2014immunization, vitamin A, and deworming coverage declined, and zinc supplementation for diarrhea was extremely limited. DEH will respond by intensifying integrated nutrition, health, and WASH programming through community-based IYCF counseling, mother-to-mother support groups, age-appropriate complementary feeding, strengthened immunization and supplementation services via static and mobile facilities, improved ANC uptake, and behavior change communication on safe water, sanitation, and hygiene. Additionally, DEH will support household food security and resilience through nutrition-sensitive livelihoods, conditional cash or voucher programs, and dietary diversification initiatives. These actions aim to reduce malnutrition, improve maternal and child health, and strengthen community systems in alignment with national strategies and international standards.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 03:31 AM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/snapshot-nutrition-awareness-behaviors-and-practices-among-galkayo-idps)\n\n**Multivaccination Campaign Begins in Juiz de Fora for Children and Adolescents Up to 15 Years Old**\nThe city of Juiz de Fora, through its Secretariat of Health (SS), will launch the Multivaccination Campaign on Monday, October 6, 2025, targeting children and adolescents up to 15 years old. The campaign follows the national strategy of the Ministry of Health and aims to update vaccination records. Vaccination clinics at Basic Health Units (UBSs) will operate from Monday to Friday starting at 9:00 AM and on Saturdays from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM. Participants must bring their vaccination record, identification document, and SUS card. If the vaccination record is unavailable, staff will assess the situation on-site. The campaign will offer vaccines from the National Vaccination Calendar, including BCG, Dengue, Hepatitis A and B, Pentavalent, Polio, Rotavirus, Pneumococcal 10, Meningococcal C and ACWY, Influenza, Covid-19, Yellow Fever, Triple Viral, DTP, Varicella, and HPV. The campaign also includes catch-up vaccinations for those who have not completed or started their vaccination schedule, such as HPV (ages 15\u201319), Triple Viral (ages 12 months to 59 years), and Yellow Fever (ages 9 months to 59 years).

The study included 50 postmenopausal women who met inclusion criteria: amenorrhea for at least 12 months or serum follicle-stimulating hormone >30 mIU/mL, along with symptoms such as vaginal dryness, burning, itching, pain, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Exclusion criteria included history of gynecological or breast cancer, pelvic organ prolapse, recent use of vaginal products or douching (within 3 months), or hormone therapy (within 6 months). Participants were randomly assigned to two groups of 25: Group 1 received zinc sulfate-containing pessaries, and Group 2 received placebo pessaries, both administered vaginally before bedtime for 14 consecutive nights. Pessaries were identical in appearance, using a glycerol-gelatine base, with zinc sulfate and lactic acid incorporated into the active group. Randomization codes were managed by an independent pharmacy at Cairo University, and blinding was maintained for participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors. Outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for symptom severity (0\u201310), the Vaginal Health Index (VHI) for elasticity, secretion, pH, epithelial mucosa, and hydration (1\u20135, lower = worse), and the Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) calculated as [(1\u00d7%superficial) + (0.5\u00d7%intermediate) + (0\u00d7%parabasal)]. Assessments were performed before and after treatment. A satisfaction questionnaire was administered two weeks post-treatment. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0; statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

The strategy combines three interventions: the RTS,S malaria vaccine (four doses between six and 18 months), long-term preventive treatment with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine tablets (between nine and 24 months), and distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets at the time of the first vaccination. This integrated approach aims to drastically reduce malaria incidence, particularly severe cases. MSF project coordinator Zakari Moluh stated the initiative responds to Cibitoke\u2019s high malaria burden and aims for sustainable protection. Community health workers have driven high participation through awareness campaigns, with parents like Claudine Tuyishimire expressing strong enthusiasm after experiencing malaria\u2019s impact on their children. Early results show a drop of over 40% in severe malaria admissions at Cibitoke District Hospital since the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. MSF is conducting operational research to scientifically evaluate the strategy\u2019s impact. According to Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Ouabo, MSF country coordinator in Burundi, the approach is simple, low-cost, and highly scalable, offering a rational solution amid declining humanitarian funding. Despite progress in prevention, MSF continues to support treatment through community health workers, rapid diagnostics, and emergency referrals, with MSF teams also strengthening pediatric and intensive care at the district hospital. In 2023, 95% of the world\u2019s 597,000 malaria-related deaths occurred in Africa, underscoring the urgency of effective interventions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 02:01 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/children-receive-triple-protection-against-malaria-cibitoke)\n\n**CDC Continues to Torture the Data**\nThe article criticizes the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for alleged data manipulation and scientific misconduct, particularly in relation to vaccine safety assessments. The author claims the CDC has repeatedly made unsupported claims about vaccine efficacy\u2014such as influenza vaccines reducing hospitalizations and mortality\u2014despite a lack of evidence from randomized trials, relying instead on flawed case-control studies. The article highlights concerns following the June 2024 meeting of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel, reformed under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to eliminate financial conflicts of interest. Despite promises of transparency, the panel was presented with allegedly misleading data regarding Merck\u2019s monoclonal antibody for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in infants, which is nearly identical to Sanofi\u2019s previously approved version. Professor Retsef Levi, one of two dissenters, identified a consistent pattern of nervous system adverse events\u2014including seizures\u2014in Sanofi\u2019s clinical trials. The CDC\u2019s presentation, delivered by Matthew Daley of Kaiser Permanente Colorado (funded by Sanofi), split the data into two age groups based on a non-standard 37-day cutoff (instead of the clinical definition of four weeks), and excluded a meta-analysis that showed a statistically significant risk ratio of 3.93 (95% CI: 1.21 to 12.79, P = 0.02) when data were combined. The author argues this data splitting was intentional to obscure risk and constitutes deception. The article further alleges that Merck concealed neurological harms from its Gardasil HPV vaccine, with complicity from the European Medicines Agency, and that the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) system has been compromised by industry funding\u2014receiving $79.6 million from companies like Pfizer, Biogen, and Merck between 2014 and 2018. The author concludes that despite Kennedy\u2019s reforms, the CDC remains untrustworthy and continues to prioritize industry interests over public health.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Activist Post](https://www.activistpost.com/cdc-continues-to-torture-the-data/)\n\n**Studies Confirm Bicycles Deliver 14x ROI and Build Climate Resilience Across Rural Africa**\nWorld Bicycle Relief (WBR) and IDinsight released a cost\u2011effectiveness analysis at the Bicycle Mobility and Impact Forum in Lusaka, confirming that bicycles generate a 14.7\u2011to\u20111 return on investment (ROI). The study builds on two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Zambia, showing that households with bicycles earned an average of $3,188 in economic benefits over five years, improved school attendance by 17 days per $100 invested, and enabled community health workers to serve 5,774 additional clients per bicycle distributed. During the 2024 drought, bicycle owners were less food insecure, maintained incomes, and preserved assets such as livestock, whereas control households sold productive assets. The analysis also reports similar gains in Malawi, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Colombia, underscoring the global relevance of the Mobilized Communities model. \"These findings confirm that bicycles are not only transformative for rural livelihoods, but also among the most cost\u2011effective development interventions we've studied,\" said Kashif Ahmed, Junior Economist at IDinsight. \"A nearly 15\u2011to\u20111 return on investment places bicycles alongside the most impactful anti\u2011poverty programs, delivering lasting social and economic benefits at a fraction of the cost.\" Beatrice, a headwoman in Chipa Village, Mumbwa District, testified that a bicycle doubled her household income from $175 to $350 per month and enabled her community to access health services without transport costs. \"Resilience is about more than surviving a drought \u2013 it's about sustaining livelihoods, protecting families' assets, and enabling communities to thrive in the long term,\" added Sean Granville\u2011Ross, Executive Director of Programs at WBR.

The study, which analyzed over 187,000 test results from 205 laboratories between 2016 and 2019, found a significant increase in the difficulty of treating common bacterial infections. The results showed high resistance to critical antibiotics, such as third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in Ghana and Malawi. In Nigeria and Ghana, more than 70% of Staphylococcus aureus samples tested were resistant to methicillin, making hospital treatments ineffective. The study calls for an urgent response, with investments in laboratories, screening, and the digitization of healthcare data systems. Meanwhile, the Mpox virus continues to spread across the continent, with new outbreaks reported in Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Kenya. The Ghanaian health service has confirmed 257 cases and one death, while the Gambian health ministry has declared an outbreak after confirming a case in the Kunkunjang Keitaya community. In Sierra Leone, over 5,000 cases have been reported since January 2025, with 46 deaths. The Nigerian state of B\u00e9nue has reported 31 suspected cases, with six confirmed, and has launched a targeted vaccination campaign. The Kenyan health ministry has confirmed 314 cases and five deaths across 22 counties, with Mombasa being the epicenter of the outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the spread of the Mpox virus. The African Development Bank (BAD) has approved a $46 million funding for the transformation of healthcare infrastructure in the Nigerian state of Sokoto. The project aims to address critical failures in the local healthcare system, where one in twenty children is completely vaccinated, and the infant mortality rate is 104 deaths per 1,000 births, nearly double the national average. The program includes the construction of a 1,000-bed university hospital, three zone hospitals with 450 beds, and six primary healthcare centers, all equipped with modern facilities and climate-intelligent infrastructure.

The 'Stop Diarrhea' campaign, which will run until September 14, aims to distribute Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and zinc tablets to families with children under five years old. The campaign will also provide important information to people about preventing diarrhea and maintaining hygiene. The goal is to effectively prevent the deaths of children in the district due to diarrhea. The campaign includes special programs at all health institutions in the district. In addition to distributing medicine to children, parents will also be educated by health experts about the use of medicine and the importance of preventing diarrhea. According to Dr. Moiz, the district immunization officer and campaign nodal officer, diarrhea is one of the main causes of death in children under five years old. However, it can be completely prevented with proper identification and treatment. He added that during the campaign, 591,356 children under five years old will receive ORS and zinc tablets. A total of 6,96,604 packets of ORS, 74,51,089 zinc tablets will be distributed. Dr. KK Kashyap, Civil Surgeon, said that the campaign aims to not only distribute medicine but also to raise awareness among the community about preventing diarrhea. During the distribution of medicine, ASHA workers will visit every house and provide important information to parents about handwashing after defecation, safe drinking water, and personal hygiene. The campaign has made arrangements for sufficient medicine to be available at the block level to ensure that 100% of children in the designated age group receive medicine.

Despite global health efforts, diarrheal diseases persist as a significant public health challenge in developing nations, particularly in Africa. The burden of diarrheal diseases among children under five in Africa is intensified by multiple socioeconomic and health system challenges, including poor health infrastructure, high poverty rates, and limited access to healthcare services. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that sub-Saharan Africa exhibits one of the highest incidences of childhood diarrhea globally, with significant variations between urban and rural settings. Contributing factors include unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation facilities or latrines, poor personal hygiene, and limited breastfeeding practices. Research indicated that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are at a higher risk of experiencing frequent episodes of diarrhea. Environmental factors, including the proximity of households to water sources and waste disposal practices, also play critical roles in the spread of diarrheal pathogens. Various studies have explored the role of healthcare interventions in mitigating the burden of diarrheal diseases, including the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination against rotavirus, and the use of zinc supplementation. However, these interventions' implementation and uptake vary widely across African countries, often due to logistical, financial, and cultural barriers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0326501)\n\n**UNICEF Boosts Support for Sierra Leone to Combat Monkeypox Outbreak**\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has increased its support for Sierra Leone to combat the monkeypox outbreak. The country reported its third monkeypox outbreak on January 13, 2025, with the first case confirmed on January 10. The outbreak mainly affects people aged 20-39, particularly women aged 20-29, and is concentrated in the western region. UNICEF has invested over $600,000 in nationwide efforts to prevent and control monkeypox, focusing on risk communication, water and environmental sanitation, education, child protection, and vaccination. A large-scale vaccination campaign was launched in March, with UNICEF and the Global Vaccine Alliance providing 58,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine. The alliance has since confirmed an additional 50,000 doses, bringing the total to nearly 110,000 doses, along with $700,000 in funding support. In the healthcare, protection, and education sectors, UNICEF has implemented a comprehensive intervention, including repairing the water supply system at the Connaught Hospital's isolation center, installing three 5,000-liter water tanks, and upgrading pipes to improve sanitation conditions. The organization has also distributed 60,000 sets of personal protective equipment to frontline workers, including medical staff, vaccination personnel, and social mobilization personnel. In school prevention, UNICEF has provided over 10,000 hygiene kits to schools, each containing a water bucket, waste container, soap, and materials to prevent child abuse and exploitation. To enhance community participation and psychological support, UNICEF is training 240 local supervisors and health workers and conducting social media and digital dissemination activities in all districts to strengthen risk communication and community engagement, counter misinformation, and connect families with necessary services, such as the free 116 child protection hotline. UNICEF is committed to coordinating the response with the World Health Organization, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other partners to control the spread of the virus. The organization urges the international community to increase investment to meet urgent needs and prevent the virus from spreading. UNICEF reaffirms its commitment to providing necessary protection, care, and accurate information to children and communities in Sierra Leone to address the current monkeypox outbreak and future challenges.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 18, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/zh/story/2025/06/1139681)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the probability that the study of chlorine distribution in Sierra Leone will find a statistically significant increase in usage among recipients is assessed as high, with forecasts ranging from 72% to 81%. Experts broadly agree that the cluster-randomized controlled trial is well-designed, sufficiently powered to detect the minimal detectable effect size (5 percentage points), and benefits from robust implementation teams and funding through GiveWell and Wageningen University. There is consensus that objective measurement (water testing) and door-to-door delivery approaches both bolster the prospects for a positive outcome.\n\nKey factors increasing the probability include the study's sufficient power, the low baseline rate (8%), effective direct delivery and education, increased WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) awareness due to recent health crises, and GiveWell's own high internal confidence (around 80%).\n\nCentral risks identified across forecasts are: behavioral complexity (recipients may be overwhelmed by multiple bundled interventions or confuse chlorine's preventive role with treatment options like ORS/zinc), cultural skepticism toward chemical water treatments, potential for substitution effects, cognitive overload, and external disruptions (such as disease outbreaks or instability) that could affect data collection or study completion. While these risks do not dominate, they temper the forecasts below certainty, particularly for experts with deep familiarity of cultural context or implementation bottlenecks in rural Sierra Leone.\n\nDespite these caveats, the strong base rate for increased chlorine usage after free distribution in similar settings, coupled with high confidence in research capacity and logistical execution, leads to a consensus forecast in the 70\u201380% range that the study will find a statistically significant increase in chlorine usage by recipients before the stipulated deadline.",
