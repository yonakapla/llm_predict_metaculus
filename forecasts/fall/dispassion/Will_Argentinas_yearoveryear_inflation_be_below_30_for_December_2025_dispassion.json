The main risks are political: if Milei\u2019s coalition loses the October 26 midterms or faces further instability, policy slippage or a brief crisis could cause a renewed inflation spike. Additionally, the IMF and some market forecasts have revised inflation projections up (to 28-41%), reflecting skepticism about sustainability, but these may not yet fully reflect the very low recent monthly prints. There is also some risk of measurement controversy, but Metaculus will resolve using the most credible available number. The base rate for successful rapid disinflations in Argentina is very low, but the current monthly data and support from the US/IMF tilt the odds.

Prolonged periods of low inflation in Argentina have been rare and typically require both deep institutional change and external credibility, neither of which are fully in place. Moreover, the YoY metric is unforgiving given high late-2024 inflation. Even with 2% monthly inflation, the annual rate will only just approach 30% by December, and any shock or deviation would push it above. Political risk is elevated post-election, and while external support has stabilized the situation for now, the sustainability of reforms is in question. Most credible forecasts (IMF, OECD, local analysts) project inflation very close to, but still around or above, 30%.

With YoY inflation already at 31.8% in September and two or three more months likely to come in at or below 2%, the mechanical path to a sub-30% outcome is strong unless a major exogenous shock occurs almost immediately. While the risks you cite are real and ever-present, the probability of them materializing fast enough to affect the December figure is lower than your estimate suggests. A more balanced assessment would give greater weight to the inertia of the current policy mix and the short-term horizon, even while acknowledging Argentina\u2019s deep-seated vulnerabilities."

From a Latin American populism perspective, your attention to post-electoral discipline and the incentives facing Milei and opposition forces is highly relevant. You properly acknowledge that, while the mechanical path of recent monthly inflation and base effects favor a Yes, Argentina\u2019s tradition of post-election policy slippage and the ever-present threat of populist backlash create real risk. Importantly, you recognize that the government\u2019s short-term incentives are aligned with maintaining stabilization at least through the end of 2025, given the high political and economic cost of reversal just before the finish line. Your estimate is prudent, reflecting both the downward trend and the non-trivial risk of reversal, and your reasoning provides a strong bridge between the arithmetic and the political economy of disinflation in Argentina. This is a model of nuanced, context-aware forecasting for such a close-call scenario."

Milei's top campaign promise [was](https://www.freiheit.org/one-year-javier-mileis-economic-policy) to fight inflation. Since then, the inflation rate has steadily come down to 2.4% for November 2024. Argentina's YoY inflation rate was 211% for December 2023, the highest in the world, and rose further to [292% for April 2024](https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi), but has since fallen to 166%.\n\nHowever, despite the drop in inflation, the annual inflation rate for 2025 is projected by [the IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/ARG) to be 62.7% for 2025 as of December 2024. Additionally, poverty [has risen](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqn751x19no) in the country due to the short-term shock caused by slashing subsidies in transportation, fuel and electricity, as well as the elimination of thousands of government jobs.\n\nAccording to [economist Juan D'Amico](https://medium.com/@JDEconomics/milei-has-outperformed-even-the-most-bullish-inflation-forecasts-for-argentina-in-2024-what-to-e0a8939f2142), forecasts have consistently been wrong to the high side on Argentina's inflation. For example, a group of economists opposed to Milei had forecasted 2024 inflation of 400%, while even some of the more optimistic forecasts were around 240%.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

Although inflation has decreased from 211% in 2023 to 33.6% in August 2025 and poverty has dropped to 24%\u2014the lowest since 2018\u2014structural issues persist. Argentina\u2019s chronic inflation stems from public distrust in the peso, a preference for dollar savings due to historical instability, and an economy heavily reliant on agricultural exports with limited industrial capacity, making it vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations. The resulting cycle\u2014dollar hoarding \u2192 peso depreciation \u2192 higher inflation \u2192 costlier imports\u2014remains unresolved. Milei\u2019s austerity measures, including a 50% peso devaluation and 35% public spending cuts, have reduced inflation but are eroding public services and may soon worsen living standards. Economists like Dario Rodriguez and Jonathan Marie argue that Milei\u2019s approach is overly simplistic and fails to address deep-rooted imbalances. The U.S. aid, while symbolic, is insufficient to fix long-standing macroeconomic deficits. Moreover, American agribusinesses oppose Argentina\u2019s tariff-free export policy, which threatens their market share, especially in China. Political risks are mounting: Milei faces corruption scandals involving his allies and family, and his support may decline ahead of Argentina\u2019s October 26, 2025, midterm elections. Despite U.S. backing driven by geopolitical concerns\u2014particularly Trump\u2019s fear of Argentina shifting toward China\u2014Milei\u2019s economic model is showing clear limits.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 02:08 AM\nSource:[Alternatives Economiques](https://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/malgre-soutien-de-trump-largentine-reste-bord-de-crise-monetaire/00116557)\n\n**Javier Milei Predicts Zero Inflation by August 2026 and Outlines Post-Election Cabinet Changes**\nArgentine President Javier Milei stated during an interview on October 17, 2025, that inflation in Argentina will reach 0% by August 2026, attributing this forecast to a 26-month lag in monetary policy effects. He expressed disgust with the current inflation rate of 30%, emphasizing that the government fixed money supply levels in mid-2024. Milei reaffirmed his commitment to reducing inflation and improving economic conditions, citing that 12 million people have been lifted out of poverty and 6 million out of indigence. He criticized the previous Kirchnerist administration for leaving behind 57% inflation and economic stagnation, contrasting it with his administration\u2019s achievements. Milei dismissed critics, including those who predicted economic collapse, and asserted that Argentina is experiencing historically low crime rates. He highlighted a broad consensus on the need for tax, labor, and structural reforms, warning that the Kirchnerist faction seeks to steer Argentina toward Venezuela or Cuba. Milei confirmed that cabinet reshuffles will occur after the October 26 legislative elections, though he declined to name individuals, noting that Santiago Caputo 'may have a central role.' He praised Diego Santilli, the La Libertad Avanza candidate in Buenos Aires Province, calling him a 'tremendous candidate' and stating that the campaign is focused on ideas rather than personalities. Milei also noted that the political shift, including Espert\u2019s withdrawal and Santilli\u2019s rise, reflects continuity in the party\u2019s core platform\u2014'violet and white, the white eagle.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 12:58 AM\nSource:[El Comercial](https://www.elcomercial.com.ar/48094-javier-milei-en-agosto-del-ano-que-viene-la-inflacion-va-a-ser-0-en-la-argentina)\n\n**H\u0131nz\u0131r H\u0131z\u0131r: Argentina\u2019s Economic Paradox and the Peronist Dilemma**\nArgentina has the highest inflation rate among countries led by white Christians, with an average inflation rate of 189% from 1944 to 2025. Despite implementing multiple programs to curb inflation, the country has failed to achieve lasting success. The dominant political-economic ideology, Peronism, is a form of populist leftism where the populace uses the state as a tool for mutual benefit. The country is presidentially governed. In the November 2023 general election, Javier Milei, a self-described 'right-wing' economist, won the presidency. He promised 'revolutionary' structural reforms based on a pure free-market system. His economic policy began with a currency reform, which was justified as Argentina's core economic problem was the lack of a stable currency. Argentinians and foreigners alike had lost trust in the Argentine peso, which had undergone 12 zero deletions in its history and even had its name changed. In 1991\u20131996, Harvard-educated economist Domingo Cavallo pegged the peso to the U.S. dollar, successfully reducing inflation, but his program ultimately failed due to resistance from Peronist cultural norms. Milei, upon taking office in 2023, inherited an annual inflation rate of 98.8% (2022). After devaluing the peso, cutting subsidies, reducing public spending, lowering taxes, closing ministries of environment, health, and education, privatizing state-owned enterprises, removing price controls, and reforming collective bargaining and strike laws, inflation soared to 254% in 2023 due to devaluation. However, it dropped to 84% in 2024 and was projected to end 2025 at 28%. Notably, the last four months had monthly inflation below 2%. Milei\u2019s strategy appeared successful, but in the previous month\u2019s local elections, a Peronist candidate defeated Milei\u2019s candidate by 13 percentage points. Markets interpreted this as 'Milei is going', causing the peso to lose 5% in value, the stock index to drop 10.5%, and Argentine sovereign bonds traded internationally to lose 16% in value. The central bank faced a dilemma: defending the peso by selling foreign reserves would jeopardize payments on maturing government bonds. Fortunately, a sudden intervention by 'H\u0131z\u0131r Trump' (a metaphorical reference) saved the situation\u2014Argentina received a 20 billion dollar peso purchase commitment, temporarily avoiding a liquidity crisis. Despite economic stabilization, the political reality remains: Peronists are expected to win the next presidential election, and they are unlikely to sustain structural reforms. Since such reforms take 4\u20135 years to yield lasting results, the country\u2019s future depends on public rationality.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 02:04 AM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/hinzir-hizir-p247306)\n\n**Argentina's Inflation Slightly Accelerates Ahead of Midterm Elections**\nArgentina's inflation rate rose slightly to 2.1% in September, up from 1.9% in August and the highest since April, according to the official statistics institute (Indec).

The updated report, released on October 14, 2025, revised downward the projected GDP growth from 5.5% (as forecast in April 2025) to 4.5% for 2025, a one-percentage-point reduction. Inflation projections were raised from 35.9% to 41.3%, an increase of 5.4 percentage points. For 2026, the IMF now forecasts GDP growth of 4.0%, half a percentage point below the previous estimate, and inflation at 16.4%, two percentage points higher than earlier projections. Despite these deteriorating outlooks, the official government projections remain more optimistic, anticipating GDP growth of 7.5% by year-end\u2014up from 6.3% projected in April. The IMF noted that global economic growth has seen only a slight improvement, remaining significantly below the pre-pandemic average of 3.7%. The organization emphasized that uncertainty around trade policy remains high due to the lack of clear, transparent, and durable agreements among trading partners. It also observed that while protectionist trade measures have so far had limited impact on economic activity and prices, the focus is shifting toward their effects on investment and consumption.

Although inflation has decreased from 211% in 2023 to 33.6% in August 2025 and poverty has dropped to 24%\u2014the lowest since 2018\u2014structural issues persist. Argentina\u2019s chronic inflation stems from public distrust in the peso, a preference for dollar savings due to historical instability, and an economy heavily reliant on agricultural exports with limited industrial capacity, making it vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations. The resulting cycle\u2014dollar hoarding \u2192 peso depreciation \u2192 higher inflation \u2192 costlier imports\u2014remains unresolved. Milei\u2019s austerity measures, including a 50% peso devaluation and 35% public spending cuts, have reduced inflation but are eroding public services and may soon worsen living standards. Economists like Dario Rodriguez and Jonathan Marie argue that Milei\u2019s approach is overly simplistic and fails to address deep-rooted imbalances. The U.S. aid, while symbolic, is insufficient to fix long-standing macroeconomic deficits. Moreover, American agribusinesses oppose Argentina\u2019s tariff-free export policy, which threatens their market share, especially in China. Political risks are mounting: Milei faces corruption scandals involving his allies and family, and his support may decline ahead of Argentina\u2019s October 26, 2025, midterm elections. Despite U.S. backing driven by geopolitical concerns\u2014particularly Trump\u2019s fear of Argentina shifting toward China\u2014Milei\u2019s economic model is showing clear limits.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 02:08 AM\nSource:[Alternatives Economiques](https://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/malgre-soutien-de-trump-largentine-reste-bord-de-crise-monetaire/00116557)\n\n**Javier Milei Predicts Zero Inflation by August 2026 and Announces Post-Election Cabinet Changes**\nArgentine President Javier Milei stated during a press interview on October 17, 2025, that inflation in Argentina is expected to reach 0% by August 2026, citing a 26-month lag in monetary policy effects. He expressed disgust with the current inflation rate of 30%, reaffirming his commitment to reducing it and emphasized that the government fixed money supply levels in mid-2024. Milei defended his economic policies, claiming that his administration has lifted 12 million people out of poverty and 6 million out of indigence, and that Argentina now has its lowest crime rates in history. He dismissed criticism from previous governments, particularly the Kirchner era, which he said left behind 57% inflation and economic instability. Milei also confirmed that cabinet reshuffles will occur after the October 26 legislative elections, though he did not disclose specific names. He highlighted Santiago Caputo's potential central role and warned against prematurely announcing appointments, stating it could harm officials. He praised Diego Santilli, the La Libertad Avanza candidate in Buenos Aires Province, calling him a 'tremendous candidate' and praising the campaign team, including Karen Reichardt.

Breaking the Cycle of Debt and Dependency**\nThe article analyzes Argentina's economic crisis through the lens of a proposed U.S.-backed 'blindaje' (financial shield) of $40 billion, contingent on the outcome of the October 26 legislative elections. It draws parallels to the 2001 crisis, when a similar $40 billion IMF-led package failed to prevent collapse, instead deepening austerity and debt burdens on workers. The current 'blindaje'\u2014led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent with $20 billion in swaps and $20 billion from private banks\u2014comes with the condition that it will only proceed if President Javier Milei's coalition wins the elections. The article argues this creates a false dichotomy: either maintain an overvalued peso and unsustainable debt (perpetuating dependency on imperialism), or face a chaotic devaluation. Despite Milei's claims of economic reform, the economy has entered formal recession (two consecutive quarters of contraction), unemployment has risen sharply (205,456 formal jobs lost since November 2023), and key sectors like industry, construction, and transport have seen massive job losses. Inflation remains high (2.1% monthly in September), and the IMF has downgraded its growth forecast for Argentina to 4.5% (from 5.5%) while raising inflation projections to 28%. The article criticizes the government's reliance on foreign capital and the FMI, calling for national sovereignty, the end of debt dependency, and the reorganization of the economy through worker-led initiatives, nationalization of banks, and control over strategic sectors to avoid a 2001-style collapse. It emphasizes that the working class and poor must lead the struggle to break the cycle of debt, capital flight, and foreign domination.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 01:12 AM\nSource:[La Izquierda Diario](https://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Deuda-y-entrega-o-devaluacion-falsa-dicotomia)\n\n**Javier Milei Predicts Zero Inflation by August 2026 and Outlines Post-Election Cabinet Changes**\nArgentine President Javier Milei stated during an interview on October 17, 2025, that inflation in Argentina will reach 0% by August 2026, attributing this forecast to a 26-month lag in monetary policy effects.

She emphasized that the IMF supports Argentina due to a 'genuine interest' in reform over the past two years, working closely with the Argentine government and key partners like the U.S. Treasury, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. However, the IMF revised its 2025 GDP growth forecast downward from 5.5% to 4.5%, and inflation projections rose from 35.9% to 41.3% annually. The current account deficit is now projected at 1.2% of GDP\u2014up from 0.4% in April\u2014due to declining commodity prices and reduced imports ahead of elections. The unemployment rate is expected to rise from 6.3% to 7.5%, with the IMF noting deteriorating labor market conditions in the first quarter of 2025. The IMF also revised its outlook for Argentina\u2019s return to international debt markets, now expecting it later than initially projected.

Despite implementing multiple programs to curb inflation, the country has failed to achieve lasting success.

The IMF now expects Argentina's GDP to grow by 4.5% in 2025 (down from 5.5% projected in July) and 4% in 2026 (down from 4.5%). Inflation is projected at 28% for 2025, up from 20% in April\u2014an 8 percentage point increase. The current account deficit is now forecast at -1.2% of GDP, a significant deterioration from the previous estimate of -0.4%. Unemployment is expected to rise to 7.5% in 2025 (from 6.3%) and 6.6% in 2026 (from 6%). These revisions reflect a deteriorating economic situation following a quarter of governmental instability. The Bank of Argentina\u2019s latest Market Expectations Survey (REM) projects a 0.6% contraction in GDP for the third quarter of 2025 and a 3.9% annual growth rate\u2014lower than the IMF\u2019s forecast. The projected growth in 2025 is largely due to a statistical 'drag effect' from 2024\u2019s severe first-half contraction, not real economic recovery. With a contraction in the second quarter and a projected fall in the third, Argentina is on the brink of formal recession, dependent only on calendar timing. Inflation, which rose nearly 2% between April and October, has moved far from the official target of 1% monthly\u2014Milei\u2019s condition for removing currency controls. The IMF expects inflation to decline to 10% in 2026 (from 12% in April), diverging from the official 2026 budget projection and private-sector estimates of 19%. A worsening current account deficit indicates that the peso\u2019s competitiveness has not significantly improved despite dollar volatility, with the currency\u2019s competitiveness level now back to July levels after peaking in mid-September.

He claimed that 'when the money doesn\u2019t reach, it\u2019s because the State is excessive,' and asserted that economic adjustment was borne by the 'casta' (elite), not ordinary citizens, citing public spending cuts and executive salary freezes since December 2023. Milei promised inflation would be 'history by 2026,' referencing a University of C\u00f3rdoba study projecting 26 months of monetary policy lag. Despite this optimism, official data from INDEC shows poverty reached 31.6% in the first half of 2025\u2014about 14 million people\u2014with child poverty at 47.2%. Private forecasts project annual inflation near 30%, and real wages remain below pre-adjustment levels. Milei also claimed to have lifted 12 million people out of poverty and that six million now eat who didn\u2019t before\u2014claims contradicted by social organizations and experts. He praised security policies under Diego Santilli and Patricia Bullrich, attacked 'guarantists' and 'perisobres,' and projected Argentina could reach Spain\u2019s per capita GDP in 10 years and Germany\u2019s in 20, possibly matching the U.S. within 30 years. The event marked the start of a federal campaign tour to rebuild support after the political scandal involving Jos\u00e9 Luis Espert, with upcoming visits to Mendoza, Santa Cruz, Chaco, and Corrientes, culminating in a planned meeting with Donald Trump in Washington on October 13, just before the legislative elections. Milei emphasized a message of fiscal discipline, reduced state intervention, and market freedom, citing Alberto Benegas Lynch (h) on liberalism as 'unrestricted respect for others\u2019 projects,' and declared 2025 'the year of the reconstruction of the Argentine Republic,' vowing to defend fiscal order 'with nails and teeth.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 05:56 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/milei-en-mar-del-plata-cuando-la-plata-no-te-alcanza-te-sobra-estado.phtml)\n\n**Milei Manipulates Poverty Rate \u2013 Media and Politics Are Misled**\nJavier Milei is praised internationally for lowering inflation and poverty, but Argentine statistics agencies and independent observers dispute the official figures.

They argue that the claim that the administration freed more than 12\u202fmillion people is unsubstantiated. Rodolfo Aguiar of ATE Nacional says the real poverty rate is 62\u202f%. The UCA\u2019s Observatory for Social Debt calls the INDEC decline \"over\u2011represented\" and \"inaccurate\", while CEPA warns that the agency\u2019s methodology underestimates poverty because the national survey on household spending has not been updated. Analysts note that 40\u202f% of the informal sector earns below the poverty line and that four in ten workers are in informal employment. Between 2024 and 2025, homelessness in Buenos Aires rose by almost 30\u202f%. Economist Hans\u2011J\u00fcrgen Burchardt warns that Milei\u2019s \"cut\u2011throat\" policies could trigger a recession, reduced spending, and a downward spiral of employment. The article quotes Burchardt saying, 'Die aktuelle Regierung hat die Armutsmessung ver\u00e4ndert, um die Statistik zu sch\u00f6nen', and Aguiar saying, 'Der INDEC und seine Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen werden f\u00fcr Wahlzwecke missbraucht.

Economically, the article highlights that inflation \u2013 which was about 140\u202f% annually when Milei took office, after hovering near 300\u202f% \u2013 fell to 36.6\u202f% in July\u202f2024.  This decline was achieved by turning a fiscal deficit into a surplus through a harsh austerity campaign that froze wages and pensions, laid off more than 30\u202f000 public employees, halted many infrastructure projects and cut subsidies for the poorest.\n\nThe article quotes Milei saying the peso was \u2018meno di un escremento\u2019 and explains that the government raised interest rates, required banks to hold more reserves and sold dollar reserves to support the peso\u2019s value.  It notes that the peso\u2019s appreciation has helped curb inflation but also made imports cheaper and exports more expensive, potentially harming domestic industry.\n\nSocial indicators are mixed: poverty fell from 41.7\u202f% in December\u202f2023 to 34.7\u202f% in May\u202f2025 after the inflationary shock, yet the austerity cuts have harmed the most vulnerable.  The article reports a 20\u202fbillion\u2011dollar IMF loan and a 6.1\u202f% GDP growth in Q1\u202f2025, but warns that inflation remains far above the 2\u202f% target and that the peso\u2011support strategy is increasingly problematic.\n\nThe piece concludes that Milei\u2019s reforms may be stalling and that his lack of parliamentary majority limits his ability to push further liberalisation.  It frames the situation as a potential experiment that could either recover or fail, drawing parallels with past Argentine presidents.\n\nKey metrics cited: inflation 140\u202f% \u2192 36.6\u202f%; poverty 41.7\u202f% \u2192 53\u202f% \u2192 34.7\u202f%; IMF loan ~20\u202fbillion\u202fUSD; GDP growth 6.1\u202f% Q1\u202f2025.\n\nQuotes used: 'meno di un escremento', 'dato eccellente', 'inflazione 140\u202f% circa', 'pesa ha un valore abbastanza alto', 'inflazione 36,6\u202f%'.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 08:14 AM\nSource:[Il Post](https://www.ilpost.it/2025/09/14/milei-argentina-economia/)\n\n**Argentina\u2019s Inflation Hits 1.9% in August, 33.6% Year\u2011On\u2011Year, Amid Milei\u2019s Economic and Political Turmoil**\nThe Argentine government, led by President Javier\u202fMilei, reported that inflation in August 2025 was 1.9% month\u2011over\u2011month, according to the \u00cdndice de Pre\u00e7os ao Consumidor (IPC) released by the Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edsticas e Censos (Indec).  The figure was slightly below economists\u2019 expectation of 2% and matched the 1.9% recorded in July.  The 12\u2011month cumulative inflation fell to 33.6%, down from 36.6% in July.  Indec data show that inflation has been easing during Milei\u2019s first year in office, with the monthly rate stabilising between 2% and 3% in 2025 and recently falling below 2%.\n\nMilei\u2019s economic programme has involved a large adjustment: after taking office in December\u202f2023 he halted federal works, stopped state transfers and removed subsidies for water, gas, electricity, public transport and other essential services, which has pushed consumer prices higher.  Poverty rose in the first half of 2024 to 52.9% of the population, but fell to 38.1% in the second half, representing 11.3\u202fmillion people.\n\nPolitically, Milei has faced a crisis after a leaked audio alleged that his sister, Karina\u202fMilei, and a government official were collecting bribes from pharmaceutical companies.  \"Est\u00e3o roubando. Voc\u00ea pode fingir que n\u00e3o sabe, mas n\u00e3o joguem esse problema para mim, tenho todos os 'WhatsApp' de Karina,\" said former Andis chief Diego\u202fSpagnuolo.\n\nThe president suffered a heavy defeat in the Buenos\u202fAires provincial election on 7\u202fApril, the most important election in the country, which accounts for almost 40% of the national electorate.  The result triggered a market reaction: government bonds, local stocks and the Argentine peso fell sharply.  On 8\u202fApril the peso hit a record low of 1,423\u202fpesos per dollar, a decline of more than 27% against the dollar.\n\nIn early April Milei secured a $20\u202fbillion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF); the first tranche of $12\u202fbillion was disbursed shortly thereafter.  The loan is part of a broader debt package that already exceeds $40\u202fbillion.  Milei\u2019s goal is to keep inflation below 2% per month and to eliminate capital controls that hinder investment.\n\nFollowing the IMF agreement the Central Bank reduced currency controls, ending the fixed parity for the peso and introducing a floating exchange rate.  The government also allowed citizens to hold dollars outside the formal banking system without declaring their source, and in June launched measures to increase dollar liquidity, reduce money supply and intervene directly in the foreign\u2011exchange market to stabilise the currency and attract investment.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 07:04 PM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2025/09/10/inflacao-argentina-agosto.ghtml)\n\n**Argentina Improves Economic Indicators, but Numbers Tell Only Part of the Story**\nArgentina\u2019s economy has shown some headline improvements under President Javier\u202fMilei, who took office in December\u202f2023.  The government\u2019s sharp spending cuts, subsidy eliminations and a new currency\u2011band regime have brought the annual inflation rate down from a peak above 250\u202f% to 4.2\u202f% in August\u202f2024, according to the Instituto Nacional de\u202fEstat\u00edstica e\u202fCenso (INDEC).  Fiscal policy has swung from a 5\u202f% deficit to a primary surplus, and the IMF has approved a US$\u202f20\u202fbillion loan that has bolstered reserves to roughly R$\u202f109.2\u202fbillion.  Analysts note that the currency band keeps the peso between 1,000 and 1,400\u202fpesos per dollar, a temporary measure that \u201cworks because the Central Bank has dollars to intervene, but does not solve the structural problem,\u201d said economist Paulo\u202fFeldmann (FIA Business School).  Growth is projected at 5.5\u202f% for 2025, and the Merval index has risen 174.46\u202f% in pesos (114.91\u202f% in dollars) in 2024, reflecting a risk\u2011laden rally.  However, high interest rates (\u2248\u202f50\u202f% per year), a heavy reliance on external credit and the looming IMF payment schedule (US$\u202f60\u202fbillion in 2027) keep long\u2011term fundamentals fragile.  In a recent interview, Economy Minister Luis\u202fCaputo highlighted a drop in poverty from 57\u202f% to 30\u202f% and a doubling of dollar reserves, but the article stresses that the country\u2019s credibility hinges on sustained policy stability and eventual transition to a floating exchange rate.  Overall, the piece presents a balanced, data\u2011driven assessment of Argentina\u2019s short\u2011term gains and long\u2011term challenges.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[Forbes Brasil](https://forbes.com.br/forbes-money/2025/09/argentina-melhora-indicadores-economicos-mas-numeros-contam-apenas-parte-da-historia/)\n\n**Silenced Silence Over Argentina: Could Media Silence Be Linked to President Javier Milei's Thrilling Success?**\nWhen Javier Milei assumed the Argentine presidency, the media portrayed him as an ultraright who would plunge the country into ruin. Economists warned of a collapse. By December\u202f2023 Argentina was in recession: monthly inflation 25\u202f%, a consolidated fiscal deficit of 15\u202f%, a looming 10th default and hyperinflation. Milei\u2019s policy package\u2014deregulation plus a 30\u202f% cut in state spending\u2014eliminated the deficit, lowered inflation to below 2\u202f%, and lifted growth above 5\u202f%. Poverty fell by more than 20\u202f% since early\u202f2024. The article argues that the \"economic miracle\" has shocked Keynesian economists who claim that spending must rise in a recession. It claims the media silence stems from ideological discomfort with a president who proves that lower state spending can spur growth and reduce poverty. The author, Philipp\u202fBagus, a professor in Madrid, calls this a \"Vogel\u2011Strauss tactic\" to ignore the libertarian success story. Key metrics: monthly inflation 25\u202f% (Dec\u202f2023) \u2192 <\u202f2\u202f% (2024); deficit 15\u202f% \u2192 eliminated; growth >\u202f5\u202f% (2024); poverty drop >\u202f20\u202f% (2024).

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Argentina's economy is projected to grow 5.5% this year, driven by improved confidence, increased credit, and rising real wages. This performance puts Argentina ahead of countries like China, Indonesia, and Brazil. Since taking office in late 2023, President Milei has implemented a 'zero deficit' policy, cutting spending by closing or merging departments, suspending public works, and reducing government subsidies for services like electricity, water, and public transportation. He has also initiated a privatization process for state-owned enterprises, reduced bureaucracy and taxes, and eliminated currency controls. As a result, Argentina's inflation rate has decreased significantly, from 25.5% monthly and 211.4% annual in December 2023 to 1.6% monthly and 39.4% annual in June 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 10, 2025 08:47 PM\nSource:[blogdobg.com.br](https://www.blogdobg.com.br/argentina-deve-ter-segundo-maior-crescimento-do-pib-entre-as-25-maiores-economias-do-mundo/)\n\n**Milei's Government: Services Rise 25%, Salaries and Goods Fall Against Inflation**\nSince President Javier Milei took office, the prices of services have increased by 25% in real terms, while salaries and goods have decreased against inflation. According to a report by the Gerencia de Estudios Econ\u00f3micos del Banco Provincia, the inflation rate has accumulated a 220% increase since November 2023 to June 2025. In this scenario, public services such as housing, transportation, and communication have gained more than 25% in real terms, but other private services such as education, health, restaurants, cinemas, and hotels are currently 12% above the level when Milei took office. In the same period, food and beverages have fallen 8% below the average price, compared to November 2023. Other goods, such as electronics, clothing, motorcycles, or furniture, have increased in price and are now 12% below. 'This reconfiguration of prices is typical of the processes of exchange rate appreciation: services rise more than goods,' said the center of studies. On the other hand, formal salaries have risen 190% between November 2023 and April 2025, losing 6.5% in real terms. 'The inflationary process of Milei had different stages. A first moment where inflation accelerated due to devaluation. There, food and beverages and public service tariffs rose a lot because the subsidy scheme needed some type of modification plus a more contractive fiscal policy,' said Mat\u00edas Rajnerman, head of macroeconomics at Banco Provincia. 'Then, inflation starts to decelerate, whose main factor of explanation is the exchange rate appreciation. So, goods run below services,' concluded. In agreement, economist Florencia Iragui explained that, although there was a strong correction of relative prices at the beginning of the government, not all adjusted in the same way. 'An example are fuels. They rose 111% between December 2023 and January 2024, but then fell a bit and, since March 2024, they have remained practically unchanged, at a level 14% above the relative price of 2019. On the other hand, prices like trains and subways show a more marked up and down due to the fact that the increases were given some months but there were others with 0% variation,' graphed Iragui.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 17, 2025 08:55 AM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/economia/2025/07/17/desde-que-asumio-milei-los-servicios-subieron-25-pero-los-salarios-y-los-bienes-cayeron-contra-la-inflacion/)\n\n**Milei's Economic Reforms Yield Results in Argentina**\nWhen Javier Milei was elected as Argentina's president in December 2023, many predicted a disaster. Inflation was at 211%, nearly every other citizen lived in poverty, and the country's foreign exchange reserves were dwindling. However, 18 months later, it appears that the libertarian economist's shock therapy has yielded results - at least on a macroeconomic level. According to the OECD's latest country report, inflation has plummeted dramatically. In May 2025, the monthly rate was 1.5%, the lowest in five years, and the annual rate is expected to remain at 37%, compared to nearly 300% a year earlier, as reported by Dagens Industri. Argentina's GDP is expected to grow by over 5% this year, and the government's finances have turned to a small surplus, according to the same source. Behind these numbers lies a program of massive cuts, including the closure of 10 departments, the dismissal of tens of thousands of state employees, reduced subsidies, and frozen pension payments. The president himself symbolized the measures by wielding a chainsaw during his campaign rallies. 'The successful fiscal tightening has already led to a significant decrease in the risk premium on Argentine government bonds,' writes the OECD in its report. The free fall that began with the reforms has now started to turn around. This is evident in households' increased purchasing power, rising real wages, and stable unemployment rates around 6%, despite nearly half of Argentinians still working informally. Consumption has become an unexpectedly strong driver of the recovery, according to the OECD.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 02:41 AM\nSource:[Realtid.se](https://www.realtid.se/marknader/milei-mot-alla-odds-sa-vande-han-ekonomin/)\n\n**Milei's Economic Impact: A Painful Success or the Dawn of a New Argentina?**\nSince taking office on December 10, 2023, President Javier Milei's economic management has had a significant impact on Argentina's economy, with results that some have described as a 'economic miracle' in a context of prolonged crisis and historically high inflation. Before Milei's arrival, Argentina faced an annual inflation rate of nearly 211%, with over 50% of the population in a state of poverty. The economy was in recession due to years of exchange controls, high state intervention, and erratic economic policies. Milei managed to improve the economic environment and achieved a significant reduction in inflation. Despite not having a majority in Congress, he demonstrated political skill in negotiating with moderate sectors and passing key laws that promoted his economic agenda in a fragmented political scenario. Milei's government implemented a fiscal adjustment without precedent, significantly reducing public spending. This included the elimination or reduction of energy and transportation subsidies, the suspension of public works, and a significant reduction in public salaries and pensions. As a result of these policies, Argentina's monthly inflation rate decreased significantly, from 25.5% in December 2023 to 1.5% in May 2025, the lowest rate in five years. Although the accumulated inflation remains high, the deceleration of the monthly rate is a key indicator of a downward trend. The agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the acquisition of external financing were crucial for strengthening international reserves and sustaining economic policy without resorting to uncontrolled monetary emission. In summary, Milei's government has achieved a deep and, so far, successful economic adjustment in a country with a history of recurrent crises. His combination of fiscal discipline, structural reforms, political management, and economic opening has laid the foundations for Argentina to reduce inflation to historic lows and resume growth. However, social costs and political challenges persist. It is still too early to celebrate victory, but the economic results achieved to date have been very positive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[ruizhealytimes.com](https://ruizhealytimes.com/economia-y-negocios/el-impacto-economico-de-milei-un-exito-doloroso-o-el-amanecer-de-una-nueva-argentina/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts are split but lean slightly toward a 'Yes' outcome\u2014that Argentina\u2019s December 2025 year-over-year inflation will be below 30%. The consensus highlights: \n\n1. Current monthly inflation is low (1.5-2.1%) and YoY inflation has fallen dramatically to 31.8% by September 2025, primarily due to aggressive fiscal and monetary tightening by President Milei's government. Most projections (IMF, OECD, private forecasts) cluster between 28% and 41%, with some official and independent estimates suggesting sub-30% is plausible if current trends persist.\n\n2. Base-rate arguments and Argentina\u2019s history of failed stabilization efforts weigh against an easy, quick, and durable disinflation (many warn the 'base rate' of sustained low inflation after hyperinflation is extremely low), especially in the absence of major regime change/dollarization. Political and social risks are considered significant, particularly with October's midterm elections looming and Milei\u2019s coalition under pressure. \n\n3. Many experts (Central Banking, Macroeconomics, Latin American Studies) agree that the outcome is highly contingent on sustaining current policies and avoiding external/political shocks post-midterms. Even a minor increase in monthly inflation or policy slippage could keep the YoY rate above 30%. Currency credibility, dependence on external support (IMF, US), and the potential for political reversal or data manipulation are repeatedly cited as downside risks.\n\n4. Positive factors include the sharp drop in monthly inflation, recent international support, and favorable mechanical 'base effects' as high-inflation months roll out of the YoY window. Some perspectives (Populism, Institutionalism, Dependency Theory) argue that, with discipline and no shocks, the downward trend should push the December print just below 30%.\n\n5. Across the group, probabilities for the 'Yes' outcome mostly cluster in the 57-65% range from optimistic perspectives, and 28-43% from more cautious/structural-historical lenses. Even the pessimists acknowledge the technical potential for a just-below-30% outcome if current monthly inflation holds; optimists emphasize the exceptional short-term progress and strong global support.\n\nIn sum: The expert panel sees a finely balanced scenario, with a modest edge (slightly better than even odds) to sub-30% inflation for December 2025\u2014contingent on no renewed political or external crises, policy continuity, and continued external support.",
