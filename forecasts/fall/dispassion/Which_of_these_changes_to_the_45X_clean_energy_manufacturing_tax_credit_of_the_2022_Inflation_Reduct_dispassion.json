From a statutory interpretation perspective, I concur that the absence of any language or committee discussion on this point in the OBBB and 2025 tax reform proposals is a strong negative signal. Your acknowledgment of progressive advocacy as a marginal factor\u2014lacking substantive influence under current partisan control\u2014is also apt.

The original question opened on 2025-04-10 18:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/36825). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit is a tax credit ([IRS](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/advanced-manufacturing-production-credit)) for domestic production in the United States of [components](https://www.plantemoran.com/explore-our-thinking/insight/2023/09/understanding-the-section-45x-tax-credit-for-manufacturers) of clean energy, such as inverters for solar panels, blades of wind turbines, and electrode materials for batteries. 45X was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which had a goal of creating a thriving, rapidly-growing clean energy sector. The role of 45X is to help the upstream manufacturers, to help ensure that a rapidly-growing sectors such as solar would have the equipment it needed to meet demand, since tax credits boost after-tax profits and thus reduce the cost of capital.&#x20;\n\nWith solar manufacturing for example, a factory making a 2 gigawatts per year, considered a modest-sized plant, could generate an annual tax credit of \\$140 million, [according to Utility Dive](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/us-treasury-irs-releases-detailed-guidance-on-45X-clean-energy-tax-credits/702691/). With batteries, the credit [is worth](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-inflation-reduction-act-electric-vehicle-incentives-are-driving-a-u-s-manufacturing-renaissance/) \\$35 per kilowatt hour for cell manufacturing and \\$10 per kwh for module assembly. These 45X incentives spurred a surge in investments in clean energy component manufacturing; in the year following the IRA being enacted, the clean energy manufacturing sector announced over \\$140 billion in new investments, which was double the amount in the two years before the IRA's enactment.\n\nIn November 2024, Donald Trump was elected president, along with Republican majorities in the House and Senate, with the [aim](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-second-term-biden-climate-change-rcna126810) to \"maximize fossil fuel production\" according to a Trump campaign official, who added, \"Some of the price tags involved with some of these credits seem to be wildly understated... We\u2019d be looking to cut a lot of that spending.\"&#x20;\n\nAt the moment, 45X benefits are not capped, which has received criticism from groups such as the libertarian Cato Institute, which [wrote](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/budgetary-cost-inflation-reduction-acts-energy-subsidies):\n\n> Under section 45X(c)(6) of the IRS code (section 13502 of the IRA), the federal government will indefinitely subsidize 50 different \u201ccritical minerals.\u201d This includes high-volume production minerals such as aluminum, lithium, nickel, and cobalt. These subsidies, particularly in the context of rising demand for lithium-ion batteries used for EVs and energy storage, risk creating a compounding effect, where multiple subsidies stack across the supply chain. For example, in a \u201csolar plus storage\u201d context, taxpayers not only subsidize the solar energy production through the PTC, but also the battery through the ITC and the minerals that go into that battery via section 45X(c)(6).\n\nIn their budget reconciliation talks, Republicans are working on possibly imposing caps on 45X, [according to Axios](https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2024/11/05/the-iras-staying-power), which also reports that there is bipartisan support for preventing Chinese entities from receiving 45X credits. &#x20;\n\nOther criticisms of clean energy tax credits such as 45X have been about share purchases. For example, the progressive thinktank Governing for Impact  [has written](https://governingforimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IRA-Stock-Buybacks-PAM_templated_FINAL.pdf):\n\n> Without sufficient guardrails, a firm could use federal assistance to finance projects it had already planned to complete using private capital; those now-unallocated private funds could subsequently be directed toward share repurchase programs\u2014 effectively enriching shareholders at taxpayers\u2019 expense and undermining the IRA\u2019s objective of increasing investments in green technologies beyond the status quo baseline. The only way to ensure this two-step substitution does not occur is if firms refrain entirely from engaging in stock buybacks over the period in time in which they are benefitting from public subsidies. Moreover, research demonstrates that stock buybacks often come at the expense of innovation in the economy, which, again, is the law\u2019s overarching objective. Prioritizing applicants that commit to eschewing stock buybacks, then, offers a way for agencies to ensure that the IRA\u2019s statutory goals are fulfilled.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36825,\"question_id\":36260}}`",

The plan, announced earlier in November 2025, eliminates green energy mandates and scrapes the 2050 net-zero emissions target, favoring a 'technology neutral' approach that supports gas, coal, and nuclear power. Dargaville criticized the absence of evidence or policy mechanisms to achieve affordability and emissions reductions, calling the plan 'a strategy for a plan to write some policy\u2014not a policy.' He noted that while Australia\u2019s residential electricity price is 39c per kWh\u20141c above the OECD average\u2014it is below the OECD average when adjusted for cost-of-living, suggesting electricity is not inherently overpriced. However, he acknowledged price increases due to rising fossil fuel costs, network charges, and retail margins. Scrapping the net-zero target creates a disconnect with the Paris Agreement, which requires global net-zero emissions by 2050. Dargaville warned that removing incentives and penalties for emissions reductions eliminates drivers for compliance, stating that around 70% of Australia\u2019s greenhouse emissions come from sectors with no current incentive to cut emissions. He also challenged the Coalition\u2019s claim that new coal or nuclear plants are needed for grid reliability, pointing to existing idle backup capacity\u2014such as open-cycle gas turbines and diesel generators\u2014worth 10\u201320 gigawatts that are only used during rare supply gaps.

This represents a significant increase, with projections indicating annual subsidies could exceed 1 trillion won. The rise is attributed to growing imports of Chinese electric vehicles and domestic automakers' supply chain diversification strategies, including the adoption of Chinese batteries. In the same period, the global market share of Korean battery manufacturers (LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, SK On) dropped to 16.9%, down 3.3 percentage points from the same period in 2024, while Chinese companies' share rose to 79.0%, up 3.4 percentage points. Leading Chinese firms include CATL (36.6% market share), BYD (17.9%), CALB (4.8%), Gotion (3.7%), EVE (2.7%), and SVOLT (2.5%). Industry experts and lawmakers, including Rep.

The order mandates collaboration among over a dozen land and natural resource agencies to develop policy proposals by September 2026 for legislative consideration in 2027, aiming to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 and 90% by 2050\u2014targets established in a 2021 executive order by former Governor Kate Brown. The latest Oregon Energy Strategy prioritizes solar, wind, geothermal, wave energy, energy storage, and energy efficiency projects. Key actions include fast-tracking permitting for projects eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s clean energy tax credits, which expire December 31, 2027, and require completion by that date for up to a 50% credit. Kotek emphasized the need for faster grid upgrades and transmission corridor development, citing a ProPublica and Oregon Public Broadcasting investigation revealing that the Northwest lags due to decades of inaction by the federal Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), which has delayed grid modernization for nearly a century. Kotek called on BPA to fulfill its commitments and improve collaboration. The state plans to add 8 gigawatts of energy storage by 2045\u2014about 50% more than current capacity\u2014with nearly 7 gigawatts already in development, enough to power roughly 5.8 million homes. The Department of Environmental Quality and the Public Utility Commission will align Clean Fuels Program revenues with investments in transportation electrification, low-income communities, multifamily housing, and underserved EV charging areas. The Clean Fuels Program requires fossil fuel suppliers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil to reduce carbon intensity of fuels by at least 37% by 2035. Clean fuel producers can earn and sell carbon credits to offset emissions. Kotek also directed a 50% or greater reduction in fuel carbon intensity by 2040, encouraging biofuels and low-carbon alternatives. The Department of Administrative Services must transition state vehicle fleets to zero-emission models and report annually on combustion-engine vehicle purchases. The Department of Land Conservation and Development will propose changes to land use regulations to expand clean energy development and transmission corridors on public lands. Despite a projected $63 million budget deficit over the next 18 months, Kotek urged agencies to use existing resources and identify funding needs for the next budget cycle.

The initiative, aligned with the EU\u2019s KUEBLL guidelines, will allow companies to pay only five cents per kilowatt-hour for half their annual electricity consumption. The federal government forecasts expenditures of 3.1 billion euros between 2027 and 2029, funded by the Climate and Transformation Fund. However, the program requires companies to reinvest 50% of the received subsidies into new or upgraded facilities that reduce grid costs, with implementation required within 48 months. The EU Commission mandates these conditions to ensure climate and energy goals are met.

The plan, announced earlier in November 2025, eliminates green energy mandates and scrapes the 2050 net-zero emissions target, favoring a 'technology neutral' approach that supports gas, coal, and nuclear power. Dargaville criticized the absence of evidence or policy mechanisms to achieve affordability and emissions reductions, calling the plan 'a strategy for a plan to write some policy\u2014not a policy.' He noted that while Australia\u2019s residential electricity price is 39c per kWh\u20141c above the OECD average\u2014it is below the OECD average when adjusted for cost-of-living, suggesting electricity is not inherently overpriced. However, he acknowledged price increases due to rising fossil fuel costs, network charges, and retail margins. Scrapping the net-zero target creates a disconnect with the Paris Agreement, which requires global net-zero emissions by 2050. Dargaville warned that removing incentives and penalties for emissions reductions eliminates drivers for compliance, stating that around 70% of Australia\u2019s greenhouse emissions come from sectors with no current incentive to cut emissions. He also challenged the Coalition\u2019s claim that new coal or nuclear plants are needed for grid reliability, pointing to existing idle backup capacity\u2014such as open-cycle gas turbines and diesel generators\u2014worth 10\u201320 gigawatts that are only used during rare supply gaps.

Despite domestic demand being outpaced by production\u2014driven by state-led expansion\u2014Chinese manufacturers are increasingly relying on exports, with nearly half of all solar cells produced in China being exported. In October, exports of 'new three' green technologies (batteries, EVs, wind and solar installations) rose by 32.4%, even as overall exports dipped due to global trade tensions. Western nations, including the EU and the US, have imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, citing unfair competition due to state subsidies and low prices. China's Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang called for removing trade barriers to ensure the free flow of green products during COP30, emphasizing dependence on foreign markets. Domestic solar expansion has slowed due to a shift from fixed feed-in tariffs to auction-based pricing since June. Meanwhile, experts like Lauri Myllyvirta estimate that Chinese green tech exports reduced global CO\u2082 emissions by 1% in 2024, potentially saving four billion tons of CO\u2082 over product lifetimes. However, China's new climate goals\u2014reducing emissions by 7\u201310% by 2035 without setting a CO\u2082 cap and increasing renewable capacity to 3600 GW\u2014have been criticized as insufficient. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra called them 'clearly disappointing,' noting China's 30% share of global emissions. Experts attribute China's cautious approach to an 'output-driven' climate policy: prioritizing massive green technology supply over binding emission targets. This strategy aims to maintain flexibility in meeting efficiency goals and positions China as a leader for the Global South. China is also increasing foreign green investments, pledging to support 10 GW of solar and 10 GW of wind capacity in other countries over five years, signaling a more proactive international role.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 12:56 PM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/cop30-chinas-riskante-wette-auf-die-energiewende/100175693.html)\n\n**Indonesia's energy transition could be turbocharged by Chinese green finance, study finds**\nA study released as Indonesia submitted its second nationally determined contribution (NDC) finds that Chinese green finance could significantly accelerate Indonesia's energy transition. President Prabowo Subianto has set an 8% economic growth target and a goal of 100% renewable energy by 2035, requiring rapid financing scale-up. Indonesia currently has only 560 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity, compared to 198 gigawatts (GW) added in China in the first five months of 2025. Indonesia receives about US$900 million annually in energy financing from China. Redirecting this funding entirely into renewable energy over the 2025\u20132034 electricity supply plan (RUPTL) period could mobilize up to IDR144 trillion (US$9 billion), equivalent to funding roughly 80 Cirata-scale floating solar plants\u2014projects capable of generating 112,000 jobs and powering four million households. The Cirata plant, built by China\u2019s PowerChina Huadong Engineering Corporation, is the world\u2019s largest floating solar facility. Tata Mustasya, executive director of Sustain and board chairman of Trend Asia, noted that indirect jobs from supply chains and local services were not included in the estimate. Despite growing investment, structural barriers remain: Indonesia lacks sufficient incentives, stable regulations, and green skills development, risking continued dependence on imported technology and foreign contractors. Without a strong local-content ecosystem\u2014including engineering, component manufacturing, and vocational training\u2014Indonesia may miss opportunities to build domestic industries. The electric vehicle (EV) sector presents major job creation potential: West Java is projected to attract IDR83.2 trillion (US$5.2 billion) in EV investments over the next decade, with EV plants potentially employing at least 72,000 workers\u2014about 4% of the province\u2019s open unemployment in 2024. Jobs at sites like the Karawang EV plant would pay IDR5,599,593 (US$334) monthly, more than double the average net salary of informal workers. China has shifted from financing coal projects to renewables, with 56% of its 2024 energy-sector financing in Indonesia going to renewables. Indonesia became the top recipient of Belt and Road Initiative investment in Southeast Asia in 2024. Mustasya emphasized the need to move beyond financing to knowledge exchange, including provincial partnerships between China and Indonesia, to improve grid planning, boost local manufacturing, and accelerate skills development. The study concludes that Indonesia\u2014rich in renewable resources, facing rising domestic energy demand, and benefiting from strong Chinese interest\u2014has a rare opportunity to fast-track its energy transition. However, success depends on stronger industrial policies, investment clarity, and long-term capacity-building partnerships. Mustasya stressed the need to align climate and economic planning: 'Our challenge now in Indonesia is how we can really connect Indonesia\u2019s climate agenda for decarbonisation and climate mitigation with our economic agenda to create employment and to push industrialisation.' The report follows a 2024 state visit by Prabowo to Beijing, where Indonesia and China signed agreements on clean energy, EVs, and industrial development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[Eco-Business](https://www.eco-business.com/news/indonesias-energy-transition-could-be-turbocharged-by-chinese-green-finance-study-finds/)\n\n**India mulls wider Swadeshi manufacturing policy to cut import dependence amid FY27 Budget preparations**\nThe Indian government is exploring a broader Swadeshi manufacturing policy to reduce reliance on foreign goods and strengthen domestic production amid preparations for the FY27 Budget, scheduled for presentation in February 2026. This follows the 2025-26 Budget announcement of the National Manufacturing Mission (NMM), which allocated Rs 100 crore to support small, medium, and medium industries under the Make in India initiative. The NMM currently focuses on five clusters\u2014engineering, electronics, consumer products, life sciences, and chemicals\u2014and supports sectors like clean-tech manufacturing, solar PV cells, EV batteries, electrolysers, wind turbines, high-voltage transmission equipment, grid-scale batteries, and labour-intensive industries such as footwear and leather. Inter-ministerial discussions, including with the finance ministry, are underway to expand the NMM\u2019s scope and potentially include new labour-intensive clusters. Despite existing initiatives like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme\u2014worth Rs 1.97 lakh crore over five years (2021-22 to 2025-26)\u2014results have been mixed: electronics manufacturing has flourished, while steel and textiles have underperformed due to low utilisation. The push for a wider policy is driven by rising global trade tensions, including 50% tariffs on Indian exports in the US, export curbs on rare-earth magnets by China, and retaliatory steel duties and import quotas from the EU. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal emphasized the need for India to become a self-reliant manufacturing hub, warning against overdependence on single suppliers or geographies, especially in critical sectors, and stressing that supply chain vulnerabilities must be assessed carefully. The goal remains to raise manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP from the current 16\u201317% to 25% by 2030.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 09:04 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-mulls-wider-swadeshi-manufacturing-policy-to-cut-import-dependence-amid-fy27-budget-preparations-13688047.html)\n\n**The One Big Beautiful Bill: Turning Point for UK and EU Energy Players Operating in the United States**\nOn 4 July 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which significantly reshapes U.S. energy policy by phasing out tax credits for wind and solar projects under the Internal Revenue Code and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Projects must begin construction before 5 July 2026 or be placed in service by 31 December 2027 to qualify for Production Tax Credits (Section 45Y) or Investment Tax Credits (Section 48E). The U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Notice 2025-42 clarified that physical work of a significant nature\u2014such as off-site manufacturing or ordering site-specific equipment\u2014must be performed to demonstrate commencement of construction, with a continuous construction requirement to avoid credit ineligibility. The OBBB extends tax incentives for geothermal, nuclear, hydrogen, and energy storage projects, with credits available for projects beginning construction before 2033 (geothermal/nuclear) or 2027 (hydrogen), and energy storage retaining Investment Tax Credits on a phased withdrawal schedule. However, all clean energy projects must comply with strict Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules: by 2030, at least 75% of material costs in energy storage projects must not originate from designated foreign entities (China, Iran, North Korea, Russia), increasing pressure on supply chains. BloombergNEF estimates a 7% reduction in energy storage additions due to these constraints. The OBBB strongly benefits fossil fuels by mandating 30 new oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf over 15 years\u2014up from just three under the IRA\u2014restoring pre-IRA royalty rates, reinstating full deductions for intangible drilling costs, and delaying the methane emissions fee until 2035. As a result, U.S. investment in wind and solar dropped 36% in 2025 compared to the second half of 2024, while EU investment rose 63%. Major UK and EU energy firms including RWE, TotalEnergies, and Shell have halted or scaled back U.S. wind projects, with Shell reportedly preparing to bid for new oil leases under the new annual schedule. The policy shift signals a major pivot in capital allocation toward upstream and midstream fossil fuel opportunities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 07:35 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-turning-8938902/)\n\n**The AI revolution has a power problem - kuwaitTimes**\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged on a podcast with OpenAI's Sam Altman that the primary challenge in the AI revolution is not a shortage of computing power, but rather the availability of sufficient electrical power and the speed of infrastructure deployment near energy sources. Tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Meta are investing approximately $400 billion in 2025 and even more in 2026 to build the data center infrastructure needed for AI, accelerating in-house chip production to compete with Nvidia. However, constructing data centers takes an average of two years in the U.S., while new high-voltage power lines require five to ten years to become operational. Virginia\u2019s Dominion Energy now has a data center order book of 47 gigawatts\u2014equivalent to 47 nuclear reactors\u2014up from 40 gigawatts a year prior. Data centers could consume 7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, according to studies. Some experts, like Jonathan Koomey from UC Berkeley, caution that projections may be inflated due to incentives from utilities and tech firms to promote growth; many proposed data centers may never be built. If growth materializes, a 45-gigawatt power shortfall could emerge by 2028\u2014equivalent to the consumption of 33 million U.S. households. In response, several U.S. utilities have delayed retiring coal plants, and natural gas\u2014currently powering 40% of global data centers\u2014has gained renewed favor due to its fast deployment. Georgia\u2019s utilities have requested approval to install 10 gigawatts of gas-powered generators, and companies like xAI and others are purchasing used turbines, including from aircraft, to accelerate deployment. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated in October that the greatest threat is not climate change, but losing the AI arms race due to insufficient power. Tech companies are downplaying past climate commitments: Google removed its 2030 net-zero pledge from its website in June. Instead, they are promoting long-term solutions: Amazon supports Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), Google plans to restart a reactor in Iowa by 2029, and the Trump administration announced an $80 billion plan to build ten conventional nuclear reactors by 2030. Additionally, hyperscalers are investing in solar and battery storage\u2014Texas plans to add 100 gigawatts by 2030. Google and Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink are also exploring placing AI chips in orbit, powered by solar energy, with Google planning tests in 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 07:40 PM\nSource:[kuwaittimes.com](https://kuwaittimes.com/article/35535/technology/the-ai-revolution-has-a-power-problem/)\n\n**Clean Energy Tax Changes Cut Timelines, Add Red Tape**\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) introduces significant changes to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), reshaping clean energy project development and investment planning. Key changes include a hard deadline for Section 45Y (clean energy production credit) and Section 48E (clean energy investment credit) eligibility: projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027. This compressed timeline threatens projects in early planning stages, as their financial models\u2014based on longer IRA timelines\u2014may no longer be viable. Projects already in service under the original IRA rules remain safe. A second major change involves Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules: projects beginning construction after December 31, 2024, that receive material assistance from prohibited entities (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) in sourcing components, financing, or IP are disqualified from credits. Uncertainty remains until Treasury issues guidance on cost thresholds. Tax equity investors will likely focus only on projects meeting the July 4, 2026, deadline, forcing developers to secure earlier, more expensive financing or shift to direct equity or state-level incentives. Merchant wind and solar projects may be paused or abandoned due to loss of long-term credit certainty, while utility-backed projects may continue with tighter margins. Battery storage projects are less affected by timing but face FEOC supply chain risks; standalone or co-located storage projects beginning construction by December 31, 2033, remain eligible for Section 48E credits. Nuclear energy is strengthened: it retains full access to Section 45Y and 48E credits through 2033 and gains a new 10% bonus credit for advanced nuclear facilities based on local employment. Additionally, nuclear projects can now use master limited partnerships (MLPs) for tax-advantaged public capital access. However, nuclear projects face new FEOC risks: existing plants may lose eligibility if owned by 'specified foreign entities' (effective immediately) or 'foreign-influenced entities' (effective July 4, 2027). Developers must audit ownership, debt, and governance structures. The OBBBA also introduces new incentives for fossil fuels: 100% bonus depreciation for qualified production property placed in service by December 31, 2030, if construction began before January 1, 2029; a 2.5% production cost incentive for metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030; and new onshore/offshore oil and gas lease sales with reduced royalties. Section 45Q carbon capture credits are enhanced. These changes signal a shift from broad, long-term renewable support to a targeted, restrictive framework. Wind and solar developers face urgent timelines, battery and nuclear developers face supply chain compliance challenges, and fossil fuels gain new financial advantages. The long-term result is a restructured energy investment landscape with new risks and opportunities across sectors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 01:53 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/clean-energy-tax-changes-cut-timelines-2514478/)\n\n**Americans, act fast: Big home energy tax credits set to expire in 2026  --  here's how to claim up to $5,000 before time runs out**\nHomeowners across the United States have until December 31, 2025, to claim federal energy tax credits under the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) and the Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC). The EEHIC offers a 30% tax credit for qualifying home improvements, with annual limits of up to $1,200 for general upgrades and $2,000 for specific high-efficiency systems like heat pumps and water heaters. The RCEC provides a 30% credit with no annual or lifetime cap for renewable energy installations such as solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage. Both programs were established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), though the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBBA) shortened their expiration from 2032 to 2025. Credits are nonrefundable and only apply to primary residences. Homeowners must file IRS Form 5695 with their tax return and retain receipts, certifications, and Qualified Manufacturer Identification Numbers (QMIDs) for qualifying items. Acting before the deadline allows homeowners to reduce tax bills, lower utility costs, improve home comfort, and increase property value. The article emphasizes that many homeowners remain unaware of these benefits and urges immediate action to avoid losing up to $5,000 in potential savings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/americans-act-fast-massive-2026-home-energy-tax-credits-ending-soon-homeowners-can-claim-up-to-5000-for-solar-panels-new-ac-units-and-insulation-upgrades-before-these-federal-savings-disappear-forever/articleshow/124584957.cms)\n\n**What's Next for Advanced Energy Manufacturing in the United States? - RMI**\nThe article explains how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will affect advanced\u2011energy manufacturing in the United States. It reports that from 2022\u20112024, companies invested more than $115\u202fbillion in electric\u2011vehicle, battery, solar, and wind components, adding to GDP and jobs while reducing reliance on China. OBBBA introduces full expensing, allowing manufacturers to deduct the entire cost of plant, equipment, and research investments in the year they are made, which could lower capital costs and encourage new plants. The act preserves the 45X advanced\u2011manufacturing production credit and boosts the 48D credit for semiconductors and solar wafers. However, the article notes new supply\u2011chain restrictions, cuts to financing programs, and early termination of some clean\u2011energy tax credits that pose headwinds. It highlights that post\u2011OBBBA demand for grid equipment, geothermal, nuclear, and upstream battery and solar components remains strong, while wind, EV assembly, and downstream battery/solar manufacturing face challenges. The article cites a 30\u202f% supply deficit for U.S. power transformers and that imports account for about 80\u202f% of current supply, suggesting domestic investment should focus on high\u2011risk components and next\u2011generation technologies. The article quotes the phrase 'full expensing' and references the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' and the 45X and 48D credits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 03:32 PM\nSource:[Rocky Mountain Institute](https://rmi.org/whats-next-for-advanced-energy-manufacturing-in-the-united-states/)\n\n**How wind and solar power help keep America's farms alive**\nThe article explains how wind and solar power provide vital income streams for U.S. farms and rural communities. In Iowa, wind supplied over 60\u202f% of the state\u2019s electricity in 2024 and lease payments for turbines range from US$3,000\u2013$5,000 per year, rising to US$5,000\u2013$10,000 for newer agreements that run 20\u2011 to 30\u2011year contracts. Nationwide, wind and solar projects generate about US$3.5\u202fbillion annually in lease payments and state/local taxes, with more than a third going directly to rural landowners. In Oldham County, Texas, clean\u2011energy projects contributed 22\u202f% of county revenue in 2021, while other rural counties rank wind farms among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing 38\u202f%\u201369\u202f% of tax revenue. The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 jobs across construction, manufacturing, and operations. In 2024, 93\u202f% of all new electricity\u2011generating capacity was wind, solar, or storage, a figure the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects to hold in 2025. Solar panels on barns and ground\u2011mounted systems reduce farm power costs and enable agrivoltaics, which grow crops beneath panels and provide a second income stream. Federal incentives expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act made solar installations affordable, but the Trump\u2011era spending bill signed on July\u202f4\u202f2025 rolls back many clean\u2011energy credits. The bill phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, especially those under 1\u202fMW, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low\u2011income areas. The Production Tax Credit, which pays eligible wind and solar facilities about 2.75\u202fcents per kilowatt\u2011hour over ten years, will be terminated for projects placed in service after Dec.\u202f31\u202f2027 unless construction begins by July\u202f4\u202f2026. The Investment Tax Credit, covering 30\u202f% of installed cost, faces similar limits. These cuts could raise production costs, increase electricity prices, and slow new renewable\u2011energy development, particularly smaller projects that benefit rural communities. Despite the rollback, existing agreements remain in place, and wind and solar projects continue to contribute millions of dollars in property tax revenue\u2014for example, Howard County, Iowa, generated US$2.7\u202fmillion in 2024, accounting for 14.5\u202f% of the county\u2019s budget. The article concludes that renewable energy not only fuels the grid but also sustains farms and rural towns, offering a practical path forward amid economic uncertainty and climate pressures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 07:14 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/wind-solar-power-help-keep-191421126.html)\n\n**Who Would Spend Billions for a Small Refund? The \u2018Korean IRA\u2019 Is a Joke**\nSouth Korea\u2019s proposed \u2018Korean IRA\u2019\u2014a tax\u2011credit scheme modeled on the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act\u2014would allow companies to deduct 15\u202f% of production costs for advanced\u2011technology products that are made and used domestically. According to the article, the current draft would give the three largest battery makers (LG\u202fEnergy\u202fSolution, SK\u202fOn, and Samsung\u202fSDI) a total refund of roughly 300\u202fbillion\u202fKRW (\u2248\u202f$200\u202fmillion) per year, based on 2024 production estimates. That amount represents only 0.06\u202f% of the battery sector\u2019s 48.4784\u202ftrillion\u202fKRW in sales, and most of the batteries produced by LG\u202fEnergy\u202fSolution and Samsung\u202fSDI are exported, leaving them with almost no eligible refund. SK\u202fOn, which supplies Hyundai and Kia batteries, is estimated to receive about 300\u202fbillion\u202fKRW, but the company has never paid corporate tax, so the credit would effectively be a zero\u2011sized benefit. The article notes that the U.S. IRA pays $45 per kWh of battery cells and $45 per kWh of modules in cash, and China offers 30\u201340\u202f% of production costs in subsidies. Industry executives say the \u201cdomestic\u2011production, domestic\u2011use\u201d requirement \u201cis contrary to the purpose of creating jobs and increasing tax revenue\u201d and that the scheme would be a \u201cmere paper incentive\u201d that would not attract investment.

The FAQs, released in an August\u202f21 fact sheet, list termination dates for credits such as Sections\u202f25E,\u202f30D,\u202f45W,\u202f25C and\u202f25D. For vehicle\u2011related credits (25E,\u202f30D,\u202f45W) the IRS explained that a vehicle is considered 'acquired' when a written binding contract is entered into and a payment has been made, but the credit can only be claimed when the vehicle is 'placed in service'; a taxpayer who acquires a vehicle on or before September\u202f30\u202f2025 may claim the credit when the vehicle is placed in service even if that occurs after September\u202f30\u202f2025. For Section\u202f25C manufacturers need not file periodic written reports on property placed in service before January\u202f1\u202f2026, but must still register to claim the credit before it expires. Section\u202f25D credits cannot be claimed for property installed or constructed after December\u202f31\u202f2025 if the taxpayer paid for it beforehand; expenditures are treated as 'made when the original installation of the item is completed.' The IRS advises taxpayers to 'wait until the time of sale' to elect a clean\u2011vehicle credit transfer, and notes that the Energy Credits Online portal will close to new registrations on September\u202f30\u202f2025 but will remain open in a limited capacity for existing users to file time\u2011of\u2011sale reports. In a separate notice, the IRS set the 2025 inflation adjustment factor for the \u00a7\u202f45Y credit at 1.9971, raising the base credit to 0.6\u202fcents per kWh and the alternative credit to 3\u202fcents per kWh for projects that meet prevailing\u2011wage and apprenticeship requirements.

The prohibited foreign entity rules prevent certain entities owned or controlled by foreign governments or companies from claiming renewable energy credits. The material assistance rules prevent eligibility for certain credits where a prohibited foreign entity has materially assisted with manufacturing or construction. The Legislation also terminates the clean electricity production credit and investment tax credit for wind and solar energy property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, but with a one-year delay for projects that begin construction within the next year. The Legislation contains revisions to Section 45X, including amendments to the definition of 'battery module' and the addition of phaseouts to Section 45X tax credits for the production of critical minerals starting in 2031. The prohibited foreign entity rules also prohibit any manufacturer that meets the definition of 'prohibited foreign entity' from claiming a Section 45X credit. The material assistance rules also apply to prohibit any property manufactured with the material assistance of a prohibited foreign entity from qualifying as an eligible component for purposes of Section 45X. The Legislation repeals several other IRA credits, including the Section 25E credits for previously owned clean vehicles and the Section 30D clean vehicle credit. The Legislation also increases the advanced manufacturing tax credit, including for semiconductor manufacturers, from 25 percent to 35 percent for certain new facilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 06, 2025 07:18 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/analysis-of-renewable-energy-credit-3295399/)\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act: Initial Takeaways for Green Technology, Taxes, and Healthcare**\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed by President Biden on August 16, 2022, allocates more than $400\u202fbillion in spending and is projected to generate over $700\u202fbillion in revenue.  Key provisions include a $369\u202fbillion climate\u2011action package that expands clean\u2011energy tax credits, a new 15\u202f% corporate minimum tax for firms with more than $1\u202fbillion in adjusted financial\u2011statement income, and a 1\u202f% excise tax on stock buybacks.

The Act introduces a new Section\u202f45Y clean\u2011electricity production credit (CEPTC) and a Section\u202f48D clean\u2011electricity investment credit (CEITC) that apply to any renewable or energy\u2011storage facility that begins construction after\u202f2025, with rates tied to a 0\u202f% greenhouse\u2011gas\u2011emissions standard.  Energy\u2011storage facilities gain an election out of the public\u2011utility property limitation and are treated as five\u2011year property under MACRS.  The Act also expands the ITC/PTC to energy\u2011storage, biogas, microgrid controller equipment, and provides a separate PTC for electricity used to produce clean hydrogen under Section\u202f45V.  Wage\u2011and\u2011apprenticeship standards can trigger an 80\u202f% credit haircut, while meeting domestic\u2011content or energy\u2011community standards can add a 10\u202f% (or 20\u202f% for low\u2011income communities) credit enhancement.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014spanning public policy, tax law, government affairs, economics, law, and political science\u2014there is a strong consensus that it is extremely unlikely Congress will enact statutory limits or penalties on share buybacks for recipients of the 45X clean energy manufacturing tax credit before January 1, 2026. The principal reasons cited are: (1) unified Republican control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress, with a declared agenda to roll back or cap clean energy tax credits rather than add progressive guardrails; (2) legislative priorities that have focused on capping credits, accelerating phase-outs, and imposing Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) exclusions\u2014not on regulating corporate finance practices like buybacks; (3) heavy industry lobbying and business interest opposition to buyback restrictions, which aligns strongly with GOP policy preferences; (4) a very low historical base rate for sector-specific statutory buyback limits, as even the notable 1% excise tax on buybacks was a broad, not targeted, measure and passed under Democratic control; and (5) minimal evidence from legislative vehicles, news reporting, or committee drafts that buyback restrictions are under serious consideration, with public and progressive advocacy for such provisions having little sway in the current political landscape. Experts agree that only a highly improbable scenario\u2014such as an unforeseen corporate scandal triggering sudden bipartisan outrage\u2014could plausibly result in such a restriction being enacted before the deadline. Final probabilities assigned to a 'Yes' outcome range from 2% to 5%, reflecting near-unanimous expert belief in a status quo outcome with no new limits on share buybacks for 45X. The most likely developments before January 2026 relate to credit capping and FEOC exclusions, not progressive reforms to corporate governance or capital allocation in the context of clean energy tax policy.",
