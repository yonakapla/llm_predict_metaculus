However, there is an unusual confluence of political will, regulatory rhetoric about speeding reviews and relaxing requirements, and strong advocacy from veterans' groups and political figures. The timeline is tight: only about 3 months remain. The most likely pathway is a company submitting an NDA or EUA (potentially with a less robust data package) in response to regulatory encouragement, or a politically driven DEA rescheduling, though the latter would be somewhat atypical without FDA movement. The recent IND clearance for a new MDMA analog is too early-stage to impact 2025 filings. On balance, the chance that at least one qualifying filing (NDA/EUA for a classic psychedelic for a DSM-5 mental disorder, or DEA rescheduling) occurs before January 1, 2026, is modestly above the base rate due to the political/regulatory tailwinds\u2014but remains below 50% given the procedural and evidentiary inertia and lack of direct news about imminent filings.",

However, the political environment has shifted sharply, with RFK Jr., Trump allies, and new FDA leadership signaling willingness to relax requirements, speed up review timelines, and prioritize psychedelics. This makes a procedural filing (not approval) more plausible, especially if advocacy groups or companies file NDAs/EUAs based on interim data, or the DEA moves on rescheduling as a political gesture. The base rate for such filings is low, but the current moment is unusually favorable. Given the resolution criteria only require a filing (not acceptance or approval), and considering the explicit signals from regulators, there is a meaningful chance (but not a majority likelihood) that at least one qualifying NDA, EUA, or rescheduling action will be taken before year\u2019s end. I judge the likelihood as moderately above historical base rate but still below even odds.",

As an expert in FDA application submission processes, I would argue that even with explicit agency and political support, the procedural and evidentiary requirements for filing an NDA or EUA are substantial and rarely bypassed, especially in the wake of the recent high-profile MDMA rejection. The vast majority of sponsors are acutely aware of the reputational and financial risks of filing an NDA or EUA with an insufficient data package, particularly after the FDA's public emphasis on robust evidence and durable benefit. Similarly, while DEA rescheduling is theoretically possible through political channels, in practice such actions have historically followed FDA movement or strong clinical evidence, and I see no concrete signs of imminent action. By focusing heavily on the political tailwinds and underweighting the inertia and practical timelines of drug development and regulatory review, your forecast risks underestimating the conservatism and procedural drag of federal agencies\u2014even in a year marked by heightened advocacy. Therefore, while the probability is above the historical base rate, a 60% estimate is more appropriate for a scenario with clear signals of an imminent filing or rescheduling, which are lacking as of October 2025."

There is no public evidence that any US-based sponsor is at that threshold for a psychedelic in a DSM-5 indication, and the FDA's recent rejection demonstrates that sponsors are likely to be even more cautious about premature filings. While political winds may speed up consideration post-submission, they are less likely to override sponsors' internal risk calculations and regulatory due diligence. Thus, unless new information arises showing an application is imminent, the probability should arguably remain closer to the historical base rate, modestly adjusted for policy tailwinds, rather than approaching a 40% chance."

Additionally, the operational realities of trial completion, data cleaning, and package preparation were highlighted as limiting factors, even for a symbolic or politically motivated filing. The group also reinforced the very low historical base rate for such filings within a short time window. However, the bar for resolution (filing, not approval) and the possibility of unexpected political intervention keep the probability above the strict base rate.

(NASDAQ:JAGX), through its family company Napo Pharmaceuticals, completed a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 2, 2025, to seek guidance on advancing its clinical development program for crofelemer powder for oral solution in treating microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), a rare pediatric disorder. The ongoing investigator-initiated proof-of-concept trial in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) demonstrated a 37% reduction in total parenteral support (PS), including a 30% reduction in total parenteral nutrition (TPN), following reinitiation of crofelemer dosing after a 12-week drug cessation period\u2014exceeding the previously reported 27% PS reduction at 12 weeks. The FDA meeting was attended by members of Napo\u2019s Scientific Advisory Board, including the principal investigator of the UAE trial. Pravin Chaturvedi, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board, stated that the FDA discussion was collaborative and indicated potential pathways to support approval, especially if the study is amended and deemed adequately controlled. Lisa Conte, CEO of Jaguar Health, emphasized gratitude for the FDA\u2019s regulatory support and noted that orphan drug designations have been granted by both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The company plans to pursue regulatory discussions in the EU and Middle East/North Africa (MENA) regions to expand access globally. An abstract detailing partial results from the UAE trial has been accepted for presentation at the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Annual Meeting, November 5\u20138, 2025, in Chicago. Additionally, Jaguar is supporting two expanded access programs in the U.S. under FDA authorization to treat pediatric MVID patients with intestinal failure. MVID affects an estimated 100\u2013200 patients worldwide and currently has no approved treatments, with a lethal natural history and significant comorbidities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[Newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/news/jaguar-health-completes-meeting-with-fda-for-advice-on-development-pathways-to)\n\n**Cellectar Biosciences Announces European Medicines Agency (EMA) Confirms Eligibility to File for Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) for Iopofosine I 131 as a Treatment for Refractory (post-BTKi) Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) | Taiwan News | Oct. 6, 2025 19:00**\nCellectar Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLRB) announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) has confirmed eligibility to file a Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) application for iopofosine I 131 as a treatment for refractory (post-BTKi) Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). The CMA submission is expected in early 2026, with potential European approval and commercial launch in 2027 across 30 EMA member countries. Iopofosine I 131, a first-in-class phospholipid ether-based radioconjugate monotherapy, has received PRIME designation from the EMA for WM patients with at least two prior lines of therapy. The CLOVER WaM Phase 2 study demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 83.6% and a major response rate (MRR) of 58.2% (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.67), with data presented at the 66th Annual American Society of Hematology Conference in December 2024. The SAWP advised that the proposed patient population\u2014post-BTKi refractory patients\u2014meets eligibility criteria for CMA, though it did not assess the sufficiency of safety and efficacy data. The U.S. FDA has granted iopofosine I 131 Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug Designations. Cellectar plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway once a confirmatory trial is underway, though this depends on securing additional funding. The company emphasized the drug\u2019s advantages: fixed dosing, 'off-the-shelf' supply, long-term isotope supply agreements, orphan drug pricing, and PRIME designation, positioning it as a strong candidate for global partnerships. The unmet medical need in WM is significant, with no FDA-approved treatments for patients progressing on BTKi therapy, and over 5,700 patients in the U.S. requiring third-line or greater therapy. The company's forward-looking statements include risks related to regulatory pathways, funding, and collaboration efforts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[Taiwan News](https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6214488)\n\n**Cellectar Biosciences Announces European Medicines Agency (EMA) Confirms Eligibility to File for Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) for Iopofosine I 131 as a Treatment for Refractory (post-BTKi) Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM)**\nCellectar Biosciences, Inc.

Clinical trials in Spain are in Phase 3 for psilocybin and Phase 2 for 5-MeO-DMT, with specialists predicting regulatory approval by the Ministry of Health 'no earlier than two years' from now. According to Eduard Vieta, head of psychiatry at Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona, psychedelics produce rapid, significant improvements in depression, with some patients achieving full remission after just one or two doses\u2014up to 87.5% in Phase 3 trials with 25 mg of psilocybin. These treatments are administered in hospitals under strict medical supervision. Maria Due\u00f1as from Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u confirmed the significant antidepressant effects of psilocybin in clinical trials. Other psychedelics like LSD and ayahuasca also show efficacy and safety. While no psychedelics are yet approved for prescription, experts believe they will bring a 'radical change' in depression treatment. The future of depression care is moving toward personalized medicine, integrating biological diagnosis, pharmacogenetics, and targeted therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Specialists like V\u00edctor P\u00e9rez and Maria Portella emphasize the importance of individualized, biologically informed treatment. Claudi Camps, director of Mental Health and Addictions in Girona, stresses the need for a holistic approach, recognizing that depression arises from a combination of biological vulnerability, trauma, poverty, and psychosocial stressors. He notes that unresolved childhood trauma can resurface in adulthood, exacerbating depression\u2014highlighting the importance of revisiting past experiences in therapy. Despite progress, chronic and treatment-resistant cases remain challenging, with relapses common after one to two years, though psychedelics and deep brain stimulation are improving outcomes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/ser-feliz/20251006/hospitales-validan-tratar-depresion-cronica-121660944)\n\n**Jaguar Health Completes Meeting with FDA for Advice on Development Pathways to Advance Ongoing Crofelemer Trial for Potential Approval for Treatment of Pediatric Indication Microvillus Inclusion Disea**\nJaguar Health, Inc.

The meeting included members of Napo Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Scientific Advisory Board, including the principal investigator of an ongoing open-label investigator-initiated trial (IIT) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). MVID is a fatal condition affecting 100\u2013200 patients worldwide, requiring life-sustaining parenteral support (PS), which includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and IV fluids, with no approved treatments currently available. Results from the UAE IIT show a 37% reduction in PS and a 30% reduction in TPN since reinitiation of crofelemer dosing after a 12-week drug cessation period\u2014exceeding the previously reported 27% PS reduction at 12 weeks. The company\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, Pravin Chaturvedi, PhD, stated that the FDA\u2019s feedback suggests potential pathways to support approval, possibly through a small, well-controlled study that could evaluate disease progression modification. Jaguar\u2019s CEO, Lisa Conte, expressed gratitude for FDA support and noted that orphan drug designations have been granted by both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

This growth is driven by advancements in precision medicine, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies, including FDA-approved agents such as FLT3 inhibitors (midostaurin, gilteritinib), IDH inhibitors (ivosidenib, enasidenib), BCL-2 inhibitors (venetoclax), and antibody-drug conjugates (gemtuzumab ozogamicin). These innovations have significantly improved survival rates\u2014e.g., chemotherapy plus midostaurin increased median overall survival in FLT3-mutated AML from 25.6 to 74.7 months. Combination regimens, such as venetoclax with hypomethylating agents, have achieved complete remission rates exceeding 70%. North America leads with a 38.2% market share due to high incidence rates, advanced healthcare infrastructure, and accelerated FDA approvals, while Europe holds 25.6% and is driven by an aging population and strong clinical research networks. Key challenges include disease heterogeneity, delayed diagnosis, and molecular testing delays that hinder personalized treatment. Emerging opportunities include CAR T-cell therapies, novel combinations (e.g., venetoclax with STING agonists), and targeted treatments for high-risk or refractory AML. Recent developments include Servier India\u2019s launch of ivosidenib (Tibsovo\u00ae) in June 2025, Pfizer\u2019s FDA label update for TALZENNA\u00ae in November 2024, Lin BioScience\u2019s FDA Fast Track Designation for LBS 007 in November 2024, and Actinium\u2019s positive Phase 3 SIERRA study results for Iomab-B in April 2024.

Clinical trials in Spain are in Phase 3 for psilocybin and Phase 2 for 5-MeO-DMT, with specialists predicting regulatory approval by the Ministry of Health 'no earlier than two years' from now. According to Eduard Vieta, head of psychiatry at Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona, psychedelics produce rapid, significant improvements in depression, with some patients achieving full remission after just one or two doses\u2014up to 87.5% in Phase 3 trials with 25 mg of psilocybin. These treatments are administered in hospitals under strict medical supervision. Maria Due\u00f1as from Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u confirmed the significant antidepressant effects of psilocybin in clinical trials. Other psychedelics like LSD and ayahuasca also show efficacy and safety. While no psychedelics are yet approved for prescription, experts believe they will bring a 'radical change' in depression treatment. The future of depression care is moving toward personalized medicine, integrating biological diagnosis, pharmacogenetics, and targeted therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Specialists like V\u00edctor P\u00e9rez and Maria Portella emphasize the importance of individualized, biologically informed treatment. Claudi Camps, director of Mental Health and Addictions in Girona, stresses the need for a holistic approach, recognizing that depression arises from a combination of biological vulnerability, trauma, poverty, and psychosocial stressors. He notes that unresolved childhood trauma can resurface in adulthood, exacerbating depression\u2014highlighting the importance of revisiting past experiences in therapy. Despite progress, chronic and treatment-resistant cases remain challenging, with relapses common after one to two years, though psychedelics and deep brain stimulation are improving outcomes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/ser-feliz/20251006/hospitales-validan-tratar-depresion-cronica-121660944)\n\n**New Medical Breakthrough Reduces Breast Cancer Progression Risk by 40%**\nIn October 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Inluriyo, an innovative oral medication for advanced breast cancer, marking a significant medical breakthrough. The drug, which belongs to the class of estrogen receptor antagonists, reduces the risk of disease progression by up to 40%. Clinical trial data from the phase 3 EMBER-3 study showed that Inluriyo reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 8% compared to traditional hormonal therapies. It works by binding to and degrading estrogen receptors, thereby inhibiting their activity and slowing tumor growth and spread. Patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying the ESR1 mutation\u2014present in about half of those previously treated with hormonal therapy\u2014experienced a median progression-free survival of five months, compared to three months with other treatments. Dr. Komal Jhaveri, clinical director for early drug development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, emphasized the drug\u2019s proven efficacy and oral administration ease, calling it a promising option for patients whose disease progresses after standard treatments. The FDA warns against using the drug during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm. Common side effects observed in trials include [specific side effects not listed in text, but implied to be documented]. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women globally, often arising from uncontrolled cell division in the breast that can spread to other body parts. Over 80% of cases are invasive, meaning the tumor can spread beyond the breast tissue. While most common in women over 50, it can affect younger women and, rarely, men. This breakthrough, announced during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, represents a major step toward better control of the disease and improved quality of life and health stability for patients worldwide.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/new-medical-reduces-breast-cancer)\n\n**Highs & Lows: Could the microdosing of psychedelics be a key missing piece in the mental health jigsaw?**\nThe article reports a renewed scientific interest in psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, ketamine and MDMA as potential treatments for anxiety, depression, PTSD and other mental\u2011health disorders. A mid\u2011stage study released in early September found that microdosing the pharmaceutical LSD MM120 could reduce anxiety for up to three months (study cited in article). WHO data cited in the article show that over a billion people worldwide live with mental\u2011health conditions; suicide claimed 727,000 lives in 2021; and depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1\u202ftrillion annually (WHO 2025 report). It notes that only about one\u2011third of patients on conventional antidepressants improve (article). The article includes quotes: Pollan says 'Mental health crises will drive acceptance of these unconventional therapies, in large part because the conventional therapies are not working very well' (Pollan to ET); Dr. Ryan L. Henner says 'The data on cannabis remains cloudy for most conditions it is purported to treat' (Henner); David Nutt says 'there is strong public support for these drugs as medicines as modern scientific studies show the ban through the UN conventions of 1960 and 1971 was politically\u2011, not science\u2011driven' (Nutt); Vidita Vaidya says 'While we do have ketamine\u2011assisted therapy in India, we don't have a progressive policy on our own clinical trials to be able to move the envelope for ourselves' (Vaidya). The article also discusses regulatory hurdles: the FDA rejected Lykos Therapeutics' MDMA\u2011assisted therapy for PTSD because of difficulty blinding studies (FDA rejection cited); the FDA observed that the difficulty to blind these studies made data hard to interpret (FDA observation). It notes that the FDA\u2019s rejection led researchers to double down on blinding (article). It mentions that the Indian Narcotics Act allows medical research but implementation is difficult (Anita Abraham). The article concludes that while psychedelics offer promise, rigorous trials, therapy integration and careful regulation are essential (article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/highs-lows-could-the-microdosing-of-psychedelics-be-a-key-missing-piece-in-the-mental-health-jigsaw/articleshow/124186421.cms)\n\n**British doctors: 'Psychedelic drugs are promising'**\nBritish psychiatrists have released a new report stating that psychedelic drugs could one day aid in treating mental illnesses, but the evidence is not yet strong enough to bring them to patients. The report, issued by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, reviews ongoing phase\u2011III trials across the UK, continental Europe and the United States involving substances such as MDMA, ketamine, LSD and psilocybin. The trials combine the drugs with talk therapy and aim to treat anxiety, depression, post\u2011traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction. \n\n\"We are cautious but excited,\" said Oliver Howes, chair of the university\u2019s psychopharmacology committee, during a press briefing. Howes, a molecular psychiatry professor at King\u2019s College London, added, \"There is a lot of activity and this is promising, but there is also a lot of complexity,\" and called for scientific activity and caution. He warned that \"participants can often tell whether they are receiving a real drug or a placebo, which makes blinding difficult,\" and that reproducibility of findings is a challenge. \n\nThe report urges more research into safety, efficacy and long\u2011term use, and the creation of a central database to monitor drug effects. An EU\u2011funded trial launched last year tested psilocybin in people with multiple sclerosis and other progressive conditions to see if it could reduce anxiety and depression. Some countries, including Germany, have already started compassionate\u2011use programmes for psychedelics, allowing patients to access the drugs under strict oversight before formal approval. In the Czech Republic, psilocybin will become legal for treating depression from 2026, though full approval for a broader range of psychedelics in Europe is still years away. Howes advised people not to self\u2011treat with psychedelics and instead enroll in clinical trials, emphasising that the substances should only be used under psychiatric leadership and a multidisciplinary team.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 07:38 AM\nSource:[euronews](http://tr.euronews.com/saglik/2025/09/19/ingiliz-doktorlar-psikedelik-ilaclar-umut-verici)\n\n**Psychedelic medicine shows promise but is not yet ready for prescription**\nA new report by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom finds that psychedelic drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, LSD and psilocybin may help treat a range of mental\u2011health conditions\u2014including anxiety, depression, post\u2011traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction\u2014but that the evidence is not yet strong enough to recommend routine clinical use.  The study reviewed existing trials and concluded that high\u2011quality data are lacking, so clinicians should not prescribe these substances outside of controlled research settings.  \"Estamos cautelosamente entusiasmados,\" said Oliver Howes, one of the report\u2019s authors and chair of the college\u2019s psychopharmacology committee, at a press conference.  \"H\u00e1 uma enorme quantidade de atividade e estes ensaios s\u00e3o promissores, mas h\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m uma enorme complexidade,\" Howes added, noting the need for sober science and caution.

The new law follows a model similar to Australia\u2019s 2024 regulations, where MDMA and psilocybin are approved for treating post\u2011traumatic stress disorder and treatment\u2011resistant depression, respectively. Unlike Australia, the Czech law does not include MDMA and restricts psilocybin to synthetic preparations, whereas New\u202fMexico in the United States has allowed the use of natural Psilocybe mushrooms. Only psychiatrists trained in psychotherapy may prescribe psychedelic substances in a clinical setting; general and public hospitals receive automatic authorization to offer the treatment, while other facilities will need special licensing.\n\nThe legislation also decriminalizes cannabis possession. In the United States, a broader biomedical regulation of psychedelic\u2011assisted psychotherapy (PAP) was expected but was rejected by the FDA in August of the previous year, denying a license for MDMA in post\u2011traumatic stress disorder from the company Lykos. The change in U.S. administration has opened the possibility of approval for psychedelic treatments, with figures such as Robert\u202fKennedy\u202fJr. and veterans, firefighters, and police officers advocating for their use.\n\nIn a September\u202f11 article in *Psychoactives*, Czech lawyer Tereza\u202fDlestikova critiques the new medical model, arguing that the reform remains incomplete without evidence\u2011based debate on non\u2011clinical uses of psychedelics.

The CRL was one of 89 rejection letters issued last week, and it cited several safety and efficacy concerns.  Lykos failed to provide data on adverse events that would help assess abuse potential, did not demonstrate that treatment effects lasted beyond the eight\u2011week assessment period after the last dose \u2013 a period the FDA says must show durable benefit for a chronic condition \u2013 and the study had high rates of prescreening failure and prior MDMA use, raising the possibility of selection bias.  The FDA therefore recommended a new clinical trial to address these gaps.  FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency will promptly release new CRLs and approvals, redacted for trade secrets, to help developers understand the FDA\u2019s reasoning.  \"We want drug developers and inventors to understand exactly how the FDA thinks,\" Makary said in a video on X.  Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, praised the Trump administration for making the CRL public and noted that the FDA \u201cmoved the goalposts,\u201d shifting its standards after the study was underway.  Doblin said the public can now see the FDA\u2019s reasoning.  The article also notes that psychedelics advocates, buoyed by comments from Kennedy and Makary about speeding up research, hope for a better chance under the Trump administration than under Biden.  In other news, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hear from former Meta employees about alleged discouragement of harm documentation, and California lawmakers are advancing a bill that would prohibit AI chatbots from presenting themselves as licensed medical professionals.

Doblin criticized the agency for shifting its standards after trials were completed, calling the change a 'devastating truth' and accusing the FDA of 'backpedaling.' He noted that 13\u202fmillion Americans live with PTSD and that each year of delay increases suicide risk and prolongs suffering. MAPS will continue negotiations with the FDA, accelerate new MDMA research, train therapists worldwide, and launch humanitarian projects in high\u2011trauma, low\u2011resource areas. The organization will host a media briefing on September\u202f5 to discuss the CRL. Since its founding in 1986, MAPS has received more than $140\u202fmillion in donations to advance psychedelic research.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 12:12 AM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/05/3145062/0/en/MAPS-Statement-on-FDA-s-Public-Release-of-Complete-Response-Letter-for-MDMA-assisted-Therapy.html)\n\n**Psychedelic Drugs Market Research Report 2025-2033 | Rising Demand for Non-Hallucinogenic Psychedelics Expands Patient Base, Breakthrough Regulatory Designations Accelerate Approvals**\nThe psychedelic drugs market is expected to grow from USD 7.4 billion in 2025 to USD 22.6 billion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%. This growth is driven by the increasing scientific validation of psychedelics for mental health therapies beyond traditional pharmaceuticals. Key substances under investigation include psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, ketamine, and DMT, showing potential to treat depression, PTSD, anxiety, addiction, and end-of-life distress. The transition from recreational stigma to clinical utility is propelled by escalating mental illness rates, the search for alternative treatments, and a mounting body of evidence supporting psychedelic efficacy in treatment-resistant cases. Regulatory shifts and decriminalization efforts, particularly in North America and Europe, are also advancing this research. Significant investments and strategic alliances are aimed at commercializing psychedelic-assisted therapies effectively and safely. The FDA's breakthrough therapy designations for psilocybin and MDMA-based treatments addressing major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD expedited clinical trial timelines, boosting investor confidence. However, legal restrictions and reimbursement barriers continue to impede widespread market adoption.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 14, 2025 12:17 PM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/14/3133452/28124/en/Psychedelic-Drugs-Market-Research-Report-2025-2033-Rising-Demand-for-Non-Hallucinogenic-Psychedelics-Expands-Patient-Base-Breakthrough-Regulatory-Designations-Accelerate-Approvals.html)\n\n**LSD and MDMA in Therapy: Trump's Health Minister Seeks to Break Tab**\nThe FDA, under the leadership of Marty Makary, is reconsidering its decision to reject MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This comes after a new study was requested by the authorities, which was a setback for advocates like Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Doblin is optimistic about the development, but also concerned that the public might get the wrong message: 'Now that RFK likes psychedelics, they're allowed.' The FDA has announced a new program to speed up the approval process for medications that benefit public health, including psychedelics. This includes reducing the testing time from six months or more to just one month, and potentially relaxing the requirements for certain medications. The US Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA have also hired new employees with connections to the psychedelic movement. 'This is a very promising sign that the government is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to send a signal that they are willing to allow them,' said Greg Ferenstein, a staff writer at the libertarian Reason Foundation. However, some experts, like Philip Corlett, a psychiatrist at Yale University, are concerned that the hype around psychedelics is outpacing the science. 'If RFK and the new administration are serious about this, they could do a lot to bring it into reality by meeting the standards of medical science,' Corlett said. 'I just don't think that's going to happen.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: July 17, 2025 12:31 AM\nSource:[DIE WELT](https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article256412618/LSD-und-MDMA-und-Co-in-Therapien-Trumps-Gesundheitsminister-will-Tabu-brechen.html)\n\n**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Trump Allies Push for Psychedelic Therapies Despite FDA Rejection**\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. and allies of Donald Trump are pushing for the use of psychedelic therapies to treat anxiety and depression, despite the FDA's rejection of MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the Biden administration. Kennedy stated, 'This line of therapy has a huge advantage if administered in a clinical setting, and we're working hard to ensure that happens within 12 months.' The FDA has begun to review its stance on psychedelics, with Director Marty Makary calling the review of MDMA and other psychedelics 'a top priority.' Makary also announced measures to speed up the approval of new treatments, including reducing the review time from six months to one and relaxing traditional requirements such as placebo-controlled clinical trials. Greg Ferenstein, an advisor to psychedelic companies and member of the Reason Foundation, stated, 'All these are very promising signs.' Texas has allocated $50 million to study the use of ibogaine, a psychedelic derived from an African plant, as a treatment for addiction and PTSD. The support includes former Republican Governor Rick Perry and veterans who have traveled to Mexico to receive treatment. Marcus Capone, a former Navy SEAL, testified that ibogaine helped him overcome anxiety and depression after 13 years of service. However, not all medical professionals share the enthusiasm, with Philip Corlett, a researcher at Yale, warning that avoiding rigorous clinical trials could be counterproductive. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, recognized the potential of ibogaine but noted that previous studies were suspended due to 'cardiovascular toxicity.' Despite the controversy, the debate on psychedelics is reopening in the US political center, with the next decision depending on regulators' ability to balance therapeutic promise with scientific evidence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 03:21 PM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2025/07/16/robert-f-kennedy-jr-y-aliados-de-trump-impulsan-terapias-con-psicodelicos-para-combatir-la-ansiedad-y-la-depresion-pese-a-reves-de-la-fda/)\n\n**New Hope for Mental Health: Can Psychedelic Substances Be a Breakthrough?**\nThe European Commission is already taking action. Within the Horizon Europe program, it has funded the PsyPal study with 6.5 million euros, led by a consortium of 18 research centers and universities, with the University of Groninga as the lead. The researchers aim to verify the effectiveness of psilocybin treatment for various mental disorders: post-traumatic stress disorder, depression in patients with palliative care needs for severe diseases such as ALS or COPD. The study is generating high expectations. The question is: can psychedelic substances really be a new frontier in treating many mental illnesses? Commonly known as drugs, they are illegal and stigmatized, but in therapeutic doses and always associated with psychotherapy, they could be a breakthrough? The University of Trento, with the first Italian conference on the topic, promoted by the Department of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences, asked this question last year. The conference broke a taboo. Following the many clinical trials conducted abroad, which seem to demonstrate their effectiveness, a specific scientific society, Simepsi, was born in Italy about a year ago, led by psychiatrist Mauro D'Alonzo, which deals with training and research on psychedelic medicine. 'If the law passes also in the Senate, it will be the first EU country to introduce them in therapeutic protocols,' says Caterina Bartoli, a doctor and member of Simepsi. In Australia, psilocybin and MDMA are already approved and prescribable. The first is also authorized in New Zealand, while in Switzerland it is regularly used on request from psychiatrists after the green light from a specific commission. 'In reality, the use of these psychoactive substances has a millennial history,' says Tania Re, a psychotherapist and anthropologist who also works in Switzerland in collaboration with psychiatrists. 'It's a history linked to the culture of many indigenous communities and passed down orally from generation to generation. It's crucial to continue to investigate their safety and efficacy, the neurobiological mechanisms and the optimal procedures for a safe and replicable therapy.' 'There are many advanced studies, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom - explains Bartoli - with a strong increase in scientific publications on the subject. In the US, the phase III of a study on the efficacy of MDMA in treating post-traumatic stress disorder has just been concluded, conducted by the scientific society Maps and the pharmaceutical company Lykos.' The Food and Drug Administration, the US regulatory agency, has asked for further data, although a 70% efficacy has already been demonstrated with just three administrations. In the UK, depression is the focus. In this field, the study by the pharmaceutical giant Compass Pathways, which has also reached phase III, is worth mentioning. The study on the treatment with psilocybin, which would validate the effectiveness of the psychedelic substance, compared to a traditional antidepressant, with a single administration, is being conducted under strict medical control, also to manage any potential side effects, such as headaches, nausea, and increased blood pressure. 'Effects that generally resolve within 24 hours,' continues Bartoli. In Italy, the only substance with psychedelic effects authorized is esketamine, a derivative of ketamine, commonly used in operating rooms. It is used by psychiatrists in the form of a nasal spray. In the US, it is used for treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation, while in Italy only for treatment-resistant depression. Since 2017, thanks to a ministerial decree, the use of psychedelic substances is allowed only in exceptional and compassionate cases. However, they are never prescribed. And there are no clinical trials involving Italian universities. 'On the one hand, there is still a lack of knowledge in the field among our doctors, on the other hand, the molecules with psychoactive effects are still perceived as recreational drugs, to get a high,' observes Bartoli. From here, the initiative of the Luca Coscioni association, which has launched an appeal to the government, signed by 170 doctors, researchers, and psychotherapists, to allow the use of these experimental treatments. An appeal accompanied by a signature collection, promoted together with Simepsi, to ask the European Commission to fund research on psychedelics. 'The resistances are not only of an ideological type: a part of the medical class remains anchored to traditional medicine based on psychopharmaceuticals,' says Marco Perduca, coordinator of all the activities of the association related to psychoactive substances.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[Il Sole 24 ORE](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/disturbi-mentali-nuova-speranza-cura-puo-arrivare-sostanze-psichedeliche-AHC8b5NB)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across 13 expert forecasts, the probability that the next step for the medical approval of psychedelics for mental health will be taken in the US before the end of 2025 was consistently assessed as higher than historical base rates, though generally still below 50%. The factors driving up the probability include an unprecedented level of political and administrative support (notably, new FDA/HHS leadership and political advocacy from RFK Jr., Trump allies, and veterans\u2019 groups), active public and industry advocacy, and the lowering of the bar in the resolution criteria\u2014mere filing of an NDA/EUA or DEA rescheduling, not their acceptance or full approval. The recent FDA rejection of MDMA for PTSD, with its strong demonstration of regulatory conservatism and demands for robust data, was repeatedly cited as the main factor dampening probabilities; most experts pointed out that the clinical pipeline is not yet mature, with pivotal data and filings for key compounds like psilocybin expected in 2026 or later. The possibility of alternative routes\u2014especially DEA rescheduling or a symbolic NDA/EUA filing, spurred by heightened political pressure or as a strategic 'first-mover' step\u2014was frequently noted as the most plausible path to a 'Yes' resolution. Expert forecasts offered probabilities ranging from 12% to 60%, with most clustering in the 23\u201338% range. The outlier at 60% judged political and regulatory signals to be even more decisive, though most agreed that, while the environment is unusually favorable, significant bureaucratic, scientific, and evidentiary inertia remain. In group discussions, there was broad consensus that: (1) few\u2014if any\u2014pivotal clinical trials would be ready for NDA filing by year-end, (2) the risk-tolerance and political motivation of sponsors/policymakers would crucially shape the odds, and (3) the low filing bar of the question slightly increases the likelihood of a Yes outcome via at least one NDA/EUA submission or politically motivated DEA action. On balance, the expert consensus is that a triggering event is quite plausible but more likely than not to slip into 2026 given the weight of scientific and procedural requirements, despite the strongest political tailwinds in US psychedelic drug policy to date.",
