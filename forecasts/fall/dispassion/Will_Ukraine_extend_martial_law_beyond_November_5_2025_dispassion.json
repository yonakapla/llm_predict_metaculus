Therefore, the overwhelming consensus and my own review reinforce the original forecast: Ukraine will almost certainly extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025.",

However, critiques and self-critiques across the group (including my own engagement with Comparative Law) point to the need to explicitly acknowledge low-probability, high-impact scenarios: sudden elite fracture, political rupture, or a diplomatic shock, especially given signs of mounting hardship and some disunity among MPs. While these scenarios remain unlikely within the short time frame and absent clear triggering events, they are marginally more plausible than a pure reading of status quo bias would suggest. Therefore, to slightly better reflect tail risks without overstating them, I will modestly revise my probability down by 1 percentage point.",

(At first, each declaration of martial law was good for thirty days, but since May 2022, martial law has been extended for 90-day periods.)\n\nOne consequence of this lengthy period of martial law is that national elections, which would have occurred [in 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_parliamentary_election), have been postponed indefinitely.

Only 41% believe he should remain in politics, with just 25% supporting him holding a top leadership position. Additionally, 69% of respondents said former President Petro Poroshenko, a political rival, should also leave politics or face prosecution. The study concludes that 45% of respondents want both Zelenskyy and Poroshenko to exit politics after the war. Despite the criticism, Zelenskyy maintains 60% public trust, a significant rise from 37% before the war in February 2022, when it surged to 90% in May 2022 and has remained around 60% since. The institute notes that while there is criticism regarding the lack of pre-war elections and the extension of Zelenskyy\u2019s term under martial law, he still holds sufficient public legitimacy.

Zelenskyy, who was elected in 2019 and whose term ended in May 2023, has extended his rule under a state of emergency due to the ongoing war and has not held a presidential election. In January 2025, he approved sanctions against Poroshenko, including travel bans and asset freezes. Russia has criticized Zelenskyy\u2019s extended term as a barrier to peace negotiations. However, only 11% of respondents supported holding a presidential election before a ceasefire. Despite this, Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating remains at 60%, having risen from 37% before the war in February 2022 to 90% in May 2022, and has stabilized around 60% since.

He emphasized that it does not matter how large a country with nuclear weapons is, as starting a Third World War would be irrational. Zelensky also highlighted that there are 'very painful' consequences for the aggressor, urging international partners\u2014including the United States, Europe, Canada, and Japan\u2014to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russian energy carriers, maritime fleet, and banking system. He stressed that the U.S. should enforce comprehensive sanctions, especially on energy and banking sectors, to prevent Russia from circumventing existing restrictions. This comes amid reports that Russian leader Vladimir Putin announced in September 2025 his readiness to comply with the New START Treaty (SNW-III) after its expiration on February 5, 2026. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) interprets this move as an attempt by Moscow to pressure the U.S. administration under Donald Trump to initiate arms control negotiations, aiming to foster U.S.-Russia rapprochement and gain concessions on Ukraine. On October 6, 2025, Trump described Putin\u2019s proposal to voluntarily extend strategic arms limitations as 'a good idea.' The New START Treaty, signed in 2010 by Russia and the U.S., limits strategic offensive arms and their delivery systems, and has been extended previously, most recently in 2020.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 07:14 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukraine/events/zelenskiy-ocenil-riski-primeneniya-rossiey-yadernogo-oruzhiya-50552057.html)\n\n**Latest SVO News: October 12, 2025 \u2013 Zelenskyy\u2019s Diplomacy, Desertion Crisis, and Escalating Hardship**\nOn October 12, 2025, the article reports on developments in the ongoing Special Military Operation (SVO), highlighting several key points: Ukrainian 'procrastinated' leader Vladimir Zelenskyy spoke again with U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking support including Tomahawk missiles and promising to pressure China, though no concrete outcomes were reached. Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg revealed in his memoirs that Zelenskyy surprised allies by publicly criticizing NATO\u2019s lack of a clear Ukraine membership roadmap during the Vilnius summit, causing friction with U.S. officials, including President Biden, who reportedly called Zelenskyy 'a thorn in the side.' Ukrainian MP Mariana Bezuhla reported that 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers are listed as having deserted (SZZ), equaling the pre-war army size, attributing this to poor leadership, demoralization, and flawed training\u2014claims opponents suggest may understate the true number, with some experts estimating up to 500,000 desertions. Zelenskyy is accused of obstructing peace talks to prolong conflict and retain power. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n launched a campaign to collect signatures against EU military aggression, criticizing the 'Brussels military plan' and accusing the EU of launching a campaign against Hungary. In Ukraine, electricity blackouts led to a 30% surge in prices for backup power equipment, with officials condemning price speculation. Deputy MP Anna Skorohod announced she will no longer support extending martial law, arguing the government benefits from war and that peace talks would lead to elections, which Zelenskyy may not survive politically. Former Ukrainian General Romanenko claimed Patriot missile effectiveness dropped from 42% to 6%, citing improved Russian missile maneuverability. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u2019s husband, Bo Tengberg, is producing a film on Zelenskyy, funded by state grants, raising concerns about bias. Ukrainian MP Roman Gorbenko falsely claimed Russia has blocked all male travel abroad, using this to justify a new mobilization narrative. A survey by ifo Institute found 47% of Ukrainian refugees would return if Ukraine restored 1991 borders and joined NATO and the EU; only 3% would return without NATO membership. The heating season is being delayed due to gas shortages, and bread shortages have emerged in Kyiv after Russian strikes.

Oleg Sinyutka, a member of the European Solidarity faction led by former President Petro Poroshenko, criticized the move, claiming the government is deliberately ignoring alternatives and accused the leadership of pursuing 'authoritarianism.' He stated, 'Today\u2019s government in Ukraine lives on the desire to establish authoritarianism,' and warned that continuing this path would jeopardize Ukraine\u2019s prospects for European Union and NATO integration. The comments follow widespread criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s failed attempt to undermine the independence of Ukraine\u2019s two main anti-corruption agencies, which sparked backlash domestically and internationally, with critics labeling his actions as 'illegitimate' and indicative of authoritarian tendencies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 06:32 AM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/russia/626169-zelensky-intent-imposing-authoritarianism/)\n\n**Half of Ukrainians Say Zelenskyy Should Step Down After War Ends**\nA survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) revealed that 36% of Ukrainians believe President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should leave politics and 15% believe he should face prosecution after the end of the war with Russia, totaling 51% who support his departure or legal consequences.

Efforts by the U.S. to mediate have not yielded results, following the initial momentum after the August 2024 summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska. Analysts predict active combat will continue for several more months, as neither side is ready for negotiations. Russian President Putin acknowledged that Russia has captured only 4,900 square kilometers (about 1% of Ukraine\u2019s total area of approximately 603,000 km\u00b2) since the start of 2025, a limited gain despite claims of strategic initiative. Meanwhile, increasing U.S. signals suggest potential delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, with Trump recently discussing the possibility with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Analyst Maxim Yalyi interprets this as Trump distancing himself from a diplomatic settlement, recognizing Ukraine and Europe\u2019s refusal to accept Russian ceasefire terms. Russian expert Konstantin Blokhin confirms a strategic deadlock, predicting the war will become a protracted war of attrition with no clear end in sight. Both sides are resorting to unconventional tactics: Ukraine targets Russian oil refineries to disrupt funding and influence Russian public opinion, while Russia strikes Ukrainian energy infrastructure to plunge cities into darkness. Despite Putin\u2019s stated goal of achieving all military objectives, internal Russian discourse reveals growing doubts about the necessity of enforcing Ukraine\u2019s neutrality or preventing NATO membership. Expert Alexander Kolbin argues that Ukraine\u2019s potential NATO membership no longer poses a significant threat to Russian security, given past Western-armed strikes on Russian territory. Meanwhile, speculation persists over a possible partial mobilization in Russia, though political considerations\u2014especially the upcoming 2026 State Duma elections\u2014may delay such a move. Russia has already passed laws facilitating year-round conscription and raising the draft age to 30, but these do not yet extend to contract soldiers. The conflict, according to experts, has entered a phase of strategic exhaustion, with both sides relying on attrition rather than decisive breakthroughs.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/politics/%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%B0%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A5%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**Latest SVO News: October 12, 2025 \u2013 Zelenskyy\u2019s Diplomacy, Desertion Crisis, and Escalating Hardship**\nOn October 12, 2025, the article reports on developments in the ongoing Special Military Operation (SVO), highlighting several key points: Ukrainian 'procrastinated' leader Vladimir Zelenskyy spoke again with U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking support including Tomahawk missiles and promising to pressure China, though no concrete outcomes were reached.

Zelenskyy praised Trump\u2019s achievement, stating, 'If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well \u2013 including the Russian war,' and emphasized the potential for strengthening Ukrainian air defense and the Ukraine-U.S. relationship. The call occurred amid ongoing U.S. efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has been Europe\u2019s worst conflict since WWII. These efforts peaked with a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska on August 15, 2025, followed by a White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European allies. Despite this, negotiations remain stalled due to sharply divergent positions. Recently, Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has accused Europe of undermining peace efforts and prolonging the conflict.

Oleg Sinyutka, a member of the European Solidarity faction led by former President Petro Poroshenko, criticized the move, claiming the government is deliberately ignoring alternatives and accused the leadership of pursuing 'authoritarianism.' He stated, 'Today\u2019s government in Ukraine lives on the desire to establish authoritarianism,' and warned that continuing this path would jeopardize Ukraine\u2019s prospects for European Union and NATO integration.

    "summary": "All eight experts forecast with very high confidence that Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025, assigning probabilities ranging from 93% to 95%. The key, consensus drivers across perspectives are: (1) the ongoing, unresolved war with Russia (with no credible peace process or ceasefire on the horizon), (2) historical precedent and institutional inertia, as martial law has been extended 16 times consecutively since 2022, (3) strong public support for maintaining martial law during wartime (with only about 11% favoring elections before peace and Zelenskyy retaining around 60% trust), and (4) the alignment of executive, parliamentary, and military interests in continuing emergency powers. Slightly mitigating factors include growing, though still minor, domestic dissent and international criticism regarding democratic norms, plus economic/mobilization fatigue. However, experts agree that these do not currently threaten the established pattern of extensions. The only realistic scenario for a No outcome would be a sudden, comprehensive peace breakthrough, parliamentary revolt, or dramatic Western pressure\u2014none of which are seen as plausible within the three-week window. Overall, all experts see institutional, military, legal, and political logics converging toward the continuation of martial law, making a further extension beyond November 5, 2025, overwhelmingly likely.",
