The historical four-year cycle suggests we may be at or near a peak, with significant downside risk if macro conditions worsen.

First, although the bubble dynamic can create extreme price overshoots, the magnitude of the move required (a >60% gain from a fresh all-time high in a short window) has only occurred during the most frenzied periods in Bitcoin\u2019s history, and even then, such spikes were typically catalyzed by a clear, new, and powerful narrative or external shock (e.g., 2017 ICO mania, 2020-21 stimulus). The current cycle, while bullish, exhibits signs of maturation\u2014such as increased institutional participation, which often dampens volatility, and a cooling of retail FOMO compared to past cycles. Additionally, recent price action has shown that Bitcoin is highly sensitive to macro shocks (e.g., U.S.-China tariffs), suggesting the risk of a deep correction is at least as high as an explosive rally. Finally, technical resistance at psychological round numbers tends to be fierce, especially with $200k representing an unprecedented valuation milestone. While a speculative tail event is plausible and certainly warrants a higher-than-average probability, the assigned 32% seems to overweight the frequency and magnitude of past blow-off tops without sufficient adjustment for the increasing maturity, size, and macro-sensitivity of the current market environment."

Today, the market is far more institutionalized, and the magnitude of the move required\u2014from $125k to $200k in less than three months\u2014would necessitate a capital influx and momentum that would be unprecedented at this scale. Moreover, recent price action reveals growing macro sensitivity, with sharp corrections following tariff and risk-off news, indicating a maturing market less prone to unchecked, exponential upside.

The institutionalization of the market\u2014evidenced by ETF flows and state-level adoption\u2014has dampened the likelihood of unchecked speculative mania, as large players are more likely to rebalance or de-risk into strength. Additionally, the historical base rate for a 60%+ rally from all-time highs at these market cap levels, particularly late in the cycle, is extremely low. While a tail event is plausible, the most likely scenario is a transition to consolidation or a cyclical correction, not a parabolic blow-off.

The recognition of thin liquidity and convexity as structural features that could enable a tail event is prudent, but keeping the probability low is consistent with the base rate of such late-cycle surges.

This framework's skepticism toward a further 60%+ rally in such a short time is validated by the historical rarity of such moves following a major bull run. Additionally, the EMH lens highlights that only truly unanticipated, exogenous shocks (e.g., a sovereign wealth fund or central bank suddenly announcing a massive Bitcoin purchase) could plausibly drive the requisite rally. The base rate of such moves is very low, and the forecast rightly emphasizes the tendency of markets to mean-revert after exuberant runs. This disciplined approach is especially relevant in an increasingly institutionalized and liquid market, where the scope for wild price dislocations, though not absent, is dampened compared to prior retail-driven cycles.

The EMH perspective suggests that much of the pro-crypto news, institutional adoption, and regulatory tailwinds have already been priced in, especially at these elevated market cap levels. Recent price action has shown the market's increased sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks and risk-off events, which tempers the potential for a purely sentiment-driven melt-up. Moreover, as the market matures and becomes more dominated by institutional participants, the probability of wild, retail-driven parabolic moves diminishes due to stronger risk management and liquidity constraints. While a tail risk event remains plausible, especially if a black swan catalyst emerges, the base rate for such a rapid, late-cycle gain is much lower than 1-in-4.

Recent price action confirms that institutionalization has not eliminated volatility, but has likely dampened the potential for unchecked, retail-driven parabolic rallies. The risk of a sharp correction appears at least as significant as the risk of a melt-up. While the possibility of a brief $200k 'wick' is nonzero due to crypto's reflexive structure, there is no evidence of a developing mania or unique new catalyst that could drive such an extreme move imminently.

Critiques emphasize that even in the presence of strong structural and narrative tailwinds, the sheer scale of the move required (+60% from ATH in <3 months), the maturing/institutionalizing of the market, and recent macro-driven volatility together make a blow-off top less likely than in earlier cycles. My initial estimate gave significant weight to the possibility of late-stage bubble overshoot, but I now see that I may have overestimated the likelihood of a reflexive, parabolic spike, especially given the market\u2019s increasing responsiveness to macro shocks and the absence of a fresh, powerful catalyst.

Critiques of higher probabilities (such as those from bubble or behavioral perspectives) convincingly highlight that market maturity, institutional risk management, and macro sensitivity have dampened the likelihood of unchecked, late-cycle parabolic moves. Defenses of lower probabilities emphasize the importance of basing estimates on historical precedent, the inertia of the status quo, and the absence of a major, imminent new catalyst. No new arguments or data emerged in phase 2 that would increase my estimate; if anything, the range and tone of the group give slightly more weight to the base-rate, status quo perspective.

While the speculative bubble and behavioral arguments highlight the possibility of a late-cycle blow-off, there is no clear evidence of the type of manic, one-sided momentum that preceded such events in past cycles.

Despite the bearish short-term trend, speculation is growing that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2024, which could boost demand. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has expressed commitment to advancing the U.S. crypto industry, and President Donald Trump has signaled plans to position the U.S. as a global crypto hub. Multiple U.S. banking institutions have pending XRP ETF applications, with approval potentially triggering a cascade of similar filings. Technical analyst MikyBull on TradingView identified bullish chart patterns, suggesting a potential breakout, and advised accumulating XRP at $2.80 for strong future gains, noting the asset is currently trading below that level. Long-term forecasts, such as those from CoinCodex, project XRP could reach $9.36 by December 2030\u2014a rise of over 230%\u2014though current technical indicators show a bearish outlook and the Fear & Greed Index stands at 70, labeled as 'greed.' Analysts caution that crypto markets remain highly volatile and recommend investor caution. The outcome of pending ETF decisions and broader market forces are expected to significantly influence XRP\u2019s future price trajectory.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 05:45 AM\nSource:[Bitnewsbot.com](https://bitnewsbot.com/xrp-slumps-11-eyes-etf-approval/)\n\n**How High Can Bitcoin Go? Experts Weigh In on the Cryptocurrency's Future**\nThe Bitcoin price surged past $100,000 in December 2024, driven by Donald Trump's election, the introduction of U.S. index funds, and the fourth halving. It subsequently rose to over $110,000 in May 2025, surpassed $120,000 by late July, and reached a new all-time high of $126,000 in early October 2025. A temporary 15% drop followed due to new U.S. tariffs, but the price rebounded above $110,000. Analysts like Simon Peters believe the rally could continue, citing historical trends: October has been a strong month for Bitcoin since 2013, with a 14.4% average gain and 10 out of 13 positive months\u2014earning it the nickname 'Uptober.' Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin could exceed $150,000 by New Year\u2019s 2026 and even reach $200,000 by year-end, citing factors like dollar depreciation, inflation, and strong U.S. stock markets. However, Thibault Desachy of Coinhouse warns that the current bull cycle may be nearing its end, noting Bitcoin\u2019s historical 35-month cycle from trough to peak\u2014suggesting a potential peak around October 20, 2025. He anticipates a correction to $40,000\u2013$50,000, a 70% drop, if U.S. stock markets decline. Arthur Hayes of BitMEX argues the old cycles are obsolete due to institutional inflows, particularly from ETFs, which have reshaped market structure. Long-term, Cathie Wood and Coinhouse believe Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030, driven by national reserves (e.g., U.S., China, Brazil) and bank adoption. Bitpanda\u2019s co-CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad predicts French banks will offer Bitcoin in branches by 2030 due to public demand. Experts foresee Bitcoin evolving into a stable, low-volatility safe-haven asset like gold, decoupling from U.S. equities over time. However, all predictions remain speculative, and unforeseen events ('black swans') could disrupt the trajectory.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 07:38 AM\nSource:[01net](https://www.01net.com/actualites/jusquou-ira-bitcoin-crypto-avenir-cryptomonnaie.html)\n\n**The Trump Family's Cryptocurrency Empire Expands Amid Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**\nThe Trump family's cryptocurrency empire has rapidly expanded since former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2019 dismissal of cryptocurrencies as 'not money' and 'based on nothing.' By 2025, Trump had become a central figure in the crypto industry, leveraging his political influence to promote U.S. leadership in digital assets. His campaign and inaugural committee received $18 million from the crypto sector, according to The New York Times. The family launched World Liberty Financial (WLF), issuing the $WLFI token valued at $4.9 billion and the USD1 stablecoin\u2014fifth largest in the market\u2014with over $2.6 billion in value. The stablecoin was launched amid regulatory debates and during a market surge reaching $300 billion. Critics, including American University law professor Hillary Allen, warn that the Trumps are creating unbacked crypto assets, enabling unchecked fundraising. Major investors include Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun ($75 million) and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX, which used USD1 to invest $2 billion in Binance\u2014facing SEC charges for illegal operations and money laundering. Trump Media, the president\u2019s company, filed with the SEC for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin and multiple top assets, including the obscure Cronos token, which gained attention due to donations from its parent company, Crypto.com, to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee. Trump\u2019s children are deeply involved: Eric Trump joined the board of Metaplanet, a top global Bitcoin holder, co-founded American Bitcoin (now valued at $6.5 billion), and partnered with ALT5 Sigma to raise $1.5 billion for $WLFI tokens. Donald Jr. invested in Thumzup, a social media ad firm aiming to accumulate Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration has advanced pro-crypto policies: hosting the first U.S. crypto summit, proposing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, enacting stablecoin regulation, and opposing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Key appointments include Scott Bessent (Treasury Secretary) and Howard Lutnick (Commerce Secretary), with Paul Atkins leading the SEC, which has dismissed numerous industry lawsuits. Experts like Luz Parrondo from UPF Barcelona School of Management warn of regulatory capture and conflicts of interest, noting that public and private roles are blurred. While parts of the crypto industry celebrate the Trump-led momentum, others privately acknowledge that the surge reinforces perceptions of fraud, speculative bubbles, and risks to small investors. This was exemplified by the launch of meme coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA just before Trump\u2019s inauguration, which saw prices spike and then collapse by 82%\u201398%, wiping out investor value. Despite clear conflicts of interest, regulators have remained silent, with Allen concluding that the administration\u2019s regulatory shifts have weakened investor protections and financial system safeguards.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 03:41 AM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/negocios/2025-10-12/el-criptoimperio-de-la-familia-trump-expande-sus-fronteras.html)\n\n**After U.S. Tariff Announcements on China, All Cryptocurrencies Suffer Major Falls**\nFollowing U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting November 1, 2025, global markets experienced a sharp downturn, with U.S. stocks posting their worst drop since April. Cryptocurrencies were severely impacted, suffering massive losses within 24 hours. According to market data, crypto liquidations reached US$9.4 billion\u2014surpassing the peak during the Covid-19 crisis. Bitcoin, which had risen above US$122,000 on Friday afternoon, fell 12% and dropped to around US$110,000 by Saturday, briefly touching US$105,000. Ethereum declined from US$4,365 to US$3,800, a drop of nearly 13%. Despite earlier gains driven by a favorable regulatory environment under the Republican government and expectations of a weaker U.S. dollar due to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, investor sentiment reversed rapidly. The tariff announcement followed China\u2019s new export restrictions on rare earth minerals\u2014critical for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and fighter jets\u2014giving Beijing a strategic advantage. Trump responded by threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and announced parallel export controls on critical software to China. In the midst of the sell-off, Argentina-based crypto wallet Lemon reported a surge in buying interest in non-stablecoins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as users saw the downturn as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin had previously surpassed US$124,000 earlier in the week, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/economia/2025/10/11/tras-los-anuncios-de-eeuu-sobre-aranceles-a-china-todas-las-criptomonedas-sufrieron-fuertes-caidas/)\n\n**Bitcoin price forecast: White House crypto report omitted BTC reserve update**\nThe White House's July 31, 2025, crypto policy report failed to provide updates on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve initiative, despite its initial announcement in March 2025 under the Trump administration. The 166-page report addressed regulation, banking access, and tax reform but omitted any mention of government Bitcoin purchases or expansion of the reserve, disappointing crypto advocates. Nevertheless, Bitcoin (BTC) remained resilient, trading at $118,383\u2014near its all-time high of $123,000\u2014after a modest correction. Market indicators show strong bullish momentum: spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $2 billion in inflows within two days in mid-July, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT managing over $80 billion in assets. Institutional holdings now account for approximately 1.4 million BTC (6.6% of total supply). Technical indicators support optimism: the MVRV ratio is near its 365-day average at 2.2, Bollinger Bands are tightening, and the RSI stands at 42.65, suggesting room for upward movement. A breakout above $119,900 could trigger a rapid return to record highs. Trade volume rose 12% in 24 hours to $70.3 billion, and long-term holding behavior indicates sustained investor confidence. The recently signed GENIUS Act also boosted sentiment by improving stablecoin accessibility. Despite the lack of regulatory clarity, Bitcoin\u2019s price is holding strong amid institutional demand and favorable technical conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[businesstelegraph.co.uk](https://businesstelegraph.co.uk/bitcoin-price-forecast-white-house-crypto-report-omitted-btc-reserve-update/)\n\n**XRP Slumps 11%, Eyes ETF Approval as Bulls Predict 2024 Rebound**\nRipple's XRP dropped 11% last week, closing at just above $2.50\u2014its lowest level in nearly three months\u2014amid increasing selling pressure and concerns about further declines below the $3 threshold.

However, the market crashed within days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on November 1, 2024, that he would impose a 100% tariff on nearly all Chinese goods and apply export controls on critical software. This announcement reignited fears of a U.S.-China trade war, triggering a massive sell-off. In just a few hours, the crypto market lost $20 billion in value, with total losses reaching approximately 10%. Bitcoin dropped from $126,000 to a low of $102,000, while Ethereum fell about 13% to $3,760. Over 99% of altcoins experienced sharp declines, with some losing nearly all value. The market entered a 'wait-and-see' stance, awaiting clearer signals from U.S.-China negotiations. Although Trump later stated that talks with China remain open, the market remained indifferent. Analysts predict Bitcoin\u2019s psychological support level at $110,000, with a potential drop to $70,000\u2013$80,000 considered unlikely due to strong global buying pressure, upcoming regulatory changes, and expectations of a rate cut. Ethereum\u2019s support is seen between $3,600\u2013$3,700. Long-term advice includes avoiding high-risk, low-volume decentralized exchanges and focusing on major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The potential for a 'Santa Rally' before year-end offers hope for recovery, especially if key support levels hold.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 03:29 AM\nSource:[H\u00fcrriyet](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/fulya-soybas/24-saatte-20-milyar-dolar-buhar-oldu-kripto-piyasalari-trumpin-agzina-bakiyor-42981485)\n\n**ETH, BNB, DOGE lead as crypto market cap rebounds to $4T**\nThe total cryptocurrency market capitalization rebounded above $4 trillion on October 13, 2025, following a sharp crash on Friday that erased nearly $500 billion in value. Ether (ETH), BNB, and Dogecoin led the recovery with gains of 10.5%, 13.6%, and 12.5% respectively, while Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK) also rose over 10%. Synthetix (SNX) surged over 100%, briefly surpassing its pre-crash high, and smaller-cap coins like Mantle (MNT) and Bittensor (TAO) gained more than 30%. The crash was triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a 100% tariff on China, aimed at restricting exports of rare earth minerals critical for computer chips. Market instability was worsened by Binance\u2019s front end displaying $0 prices for several altcoins and a depegging of the USDe synthetic dollar due to an internal oracle issue. The market began recovering after Trump stated, 'not to worry about China,' clarifying that the U.S. aims to help, not harm, China. Analysts remain optimistic: Mister Crypto noted Bitcoin is retesting the golden cross\u2014a bullish technical pattern linked to past major rallies\u2014suggesting a potential explosive rise. Crypto trader Alex Becker said there is a 'very high chance' this marks the start of a new bull market, while Samson Mow of Jan3 called it 'time for Bitcoin's next leg up.' Analyst 'Mac' expects only minor upward movement in the short term. Bitcoin is currently trading at $115,585, down 4.9% from the start of the dip and 8.8% from its $126,080 peak on October 6, 2025. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate Ether treasury company, purchased over 128,700 ETH worth $480 million post-crash. Executive chairman Tom Lee called the pullback 'overdue' and a 'good buying opportunity,' while Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor confirmed his company bought during the dip, posting a chart to X with the caption: 'Don't Stop \u20bfelievin.' No other Bitcoin-holding companies confirmed purchases or sales over the weekend, according to BitBo's Bitcoin Treasuries data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 12:02 AM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eth-bnb-doge-surge-crypto-recovers-flash-crash)\n\n**How High Can Bitcoin Go? Experts Weigh In on the Cryptocurrency's Future**\nThe Bitcoin price surged past $100,000 in December 2024, driven by Donald Trump's election, the introduction of U.S. index funds, and the fourth halving. It subsequently rose to over $110,000 in May 2025, surpassed $120,000 by late July, and reached a new all-time high of $126,000 in early October 2025. A temporary 15% drop followed due to new U.S. tariffs, but the price rebounded above $110,000. Analysts like Simon Peters believe the rally could continue, citing historical trends: October has been a strong month for Bitcoin since 2013, with a 14.4% average gain and 10 out of 13 positive months\u2014earning it the nickname 'Uptober.' Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin could exceed $150,000 by New Year\u2019s 2026 and even reach $200,000 by year-end, citing factors like dollar depreciation, inflation, and strong U.S. stock markets. However, Thibault Desachy of Coinhouse warns that the current bull cycle may be nearing its end, noting Bitcoin\u2019s historical 35-month cycle from trough to peak\u2014suggesting a potential peak around October 20, 2025. He anticipates a correction to $40,000\u2013$50,000, a 70% drop, if U.S. stock markets decline. Arthur Hayes of BitMEX argues the old cycles are obsolete due to institutional inflows, particularly from ETFs, which have reshaped market structure. Long-term, Cathie Wood and Coinhouse believe Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030, driven by national reserves (e.g., U.S., China, Brazil) and bank adoption. Bitpanda\u2019s co-CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad predicts French banks will offer Bitcoin in branches by 2030 due to public demand. Experts foresee Bitcoin evolving into a stable, low-volatility safe-haven asset like gold, decoupling from U.S. equities over time. However, all predictions remain speculative, and unforeseen events ('black swans') could disrupt the trajectory.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 07:38 AM\nSource:[01net](https://www.01net.com/actualites/jusquou-ira-bitcoin-crypto-avenir-cryptomonnaie.html)\n\n**The Trump Family's Cryptocurrency Empire Expands Amid Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**\nThe Trump family's cryptocurrency empire has rapidly expanded since former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2019 dismissal of cryptocurrencies as 'not money' and 'based on nothing.' By 2025, Trump had become a central figure in the crypto industry, leveraging his political influence to promote U.S. leadership in digital assets. His campaign and inaugural committee received $18 million from the crypto sector, according to The New York Times. The family launched World Liberty Financial (WLF), issuing the $WLFI token valued at $4.9 billion and the USD1 stablecoin\u2014fifth largest in the market\u2014with over $2.6 billion in value. The stablecoin was launched amid regulatory debates and during a market surge reaching $300 billion. Critics, including American University law professor Hillary Allen, warn that the Trumps are creating unbacked crypto assets, enabling unchecked fundraising. Major investors include Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun ($75 million) and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX, which used USD1 to invest $2 billion in Binance\u2014facing SEC charges for illegal operations and money laundering. Trump Media, the president\u2019s company, filed with the SEC for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin and multiple top assets, including the obscure Cronos token, which gained attention due to donations from its parent company, Crypto.com, to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee. Trump\u2019s children are deeply involved: Eric Trump joined the board of Metaplanet, a top global Bitcoin holder, co-founded American Bitcoin (now valued at $6.5 billion), and partnered with ALT5 Sigma to raise $1.5 billion for $WLFI tokens. Donald Jr. invested in Thumzup, a social media ad firm aiming to accumulate Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration has advanced pro-crypto policies: hosting the first U.S. crypto summit, proposing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, enacting stablecoin regulation, and opposing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Key appointments include Scott Bessent (Treasury Secretary) and Howard Lutnick (Commerce Secretary), with Paul Atkins leading the SEC, which has dismissed numerous industry lawsuits. Experts like Luz Parrondo from UPF Barcelona School of Management warn of regulatory capture and conflicts of interest, noting that public and private roles are blurred. While parts of the crypto industry celebrate the Trump-led momentum, others privately acknowledge that the surge reinforces perceptions of fraud, speculative bubbles, and risks to small investors. This was exemplified by the launch of meme coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA just before Trump\u2019s inauguration, which saw prices spike and then collapse by 82%\u201398%, wiping out investor value. Despite clear conflicts of interest, regulators have remained silent, with Allen concluding that the administration\u2019s regulatory shifts have weakened investor protections and financial system safeguards.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 03:41 AM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/negocios/2025-10-12/el-criptoimperio-de-la-familia-trump-expande-sus-fronteras.html)\n\n**After U.S. Tariff Announcements on China, All Cryptocurrencies Suffer Major Falls**\nFollowing U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting November 1, 2025, global markets experienced a sharp downturn, with U.S. stocks posting their worst drop since April. Cryptocurrencies were severely impacted, suffering massive losses within 24 hours. According to market data, crypto liquidations reached US$9.4 billion\u2014surpassing the peak during the Covid-19 crisis. Bitcoin, which had risen above US$122,000 on Friday afternoon, fell 12% and dropped to around US$110,000 by Saturday, briefly touching US$105,000. Ethereum declined from US$4,365 to US$3,800, a drop of nearly 13%. Despite earlier gains driven by a favorable regulatory environment under the Republican government and expectations of a weaker U.S. dollar due to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, investor sentiment reversed rapidly. The tariff announcement followed China\u2019s new export restrictions on rare earth minerals\u2014critical for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and fighter jets\u2014giving Beijing a strategic advantage. Trump responded by threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and announced parallel export controls on critical software to China. In the midst of the sell-off, Argentina-based crypto wallet Lemon reported a surge in buying interest in non-stablecoins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as users saw the downturn as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin had previously surpassed US$124,000 earlier in the week, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/economia/2025/10/11/tras-los-anuncios-de-eeuu-sobre-aranceles-a-china-todas-las-criptomonedas-sufrieron-fuertes-caidas/)\n\n**Crypto Wrap: Trump's China Comments Trigger BTC Sell-Off Below $118K as ETH Drops, ZEC and LTC Hold Gains**\nThe price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $118,000, reaching a low of $117,660 on major exchanges and $117,665 on Coinbase, following a sharp decline after comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Trump warned of China's growing hostility, particularly regarding export controls on rare earth elements, and stated he would be forced to respond financially as U.S. President. His remarks triggered a market sell-off, aligning with a drop of over 500 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Ethereum (ETH) also declined, falling below $4,100 and testing support near $4,000, with analysts warning of potential further downside if the trend continues. Despite the broader market downturn, privacy-focused altcoins Zcash (ZEC) and Litecoin (LTC) maintained gains: ZEC rose 23% over 24 hours, trading near $236 after briefly surpassing $269, while LTC reached a high of $135, driven by speculation around spot ETF approvals. Analysts remain optimistic about BTC and altcoins, citing potential catalysts such as spot ETF approvals, Federal Reserve rate decisions, U.S. government funding impasses, and geopolitical tensions, including the fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire. The rally in ZEC also lifted related privacy coins like Dash (DASH), Tornado Cash (TORN), and Decred (DCR). Long-term targets for LTC include $400 and potentially $1,000, with FOMO-driven buying expected if spot ETFs are approved.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[Invezz - French](https://invezz.com/fr/actualites/2025/10/10/crypto-wrap-les-commentaires-de-trump-declenchent-une-vente-de-btc-en-dessous-de-118-000-alors-que-leth-chute-le-zec-et-le-ltc-maintiennent-leurs-gains/)\n\n**Crypto Wrap: Trump Comments Trigger BTC Sell-Off Below $118K as ETH Drops, ZEC and LTC Hold Gains**\nBitcoin (BTC) dropped to a low of $117,660 on Friday, while Ethereum (ETH) fell to $4,100 amid a broader market sell-off triggered by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about China. Trump posted on Truth Social warning that China\u2019s actions\u2014particularly regarding rare earth export controls\u2014could prompt financial retaliation, creating market anxiety. This led to a sharp decline in equities, including a drop of over 500 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which in turn triggered a sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin\u2019s price test of $117,665 on Coinbase followed a prior attempt to reach $122,600. Ethereum mirrored Bitcoin\u2019s decline, falling over 3% and testing support near $4,000. Despite the downturn, major cryptocurrencies remained near key support levels. In contrast, privacy-focused Zcash (ZEC) and Litecoin (LTC) maintained gains: ZEC rose 23% to $236 (peaking at $269), driven by strong momentum in privacy coins like Dash (DASH), Tornado Cash (TORN), and Decred (DCR). Litecoin climbed to a high of $135, with bulls targeting $200 short-term and long-term goals above $400 and the psychological $1,000 level. Analysts remain optimistic, citing Michael Saylor\u2019s assertion that \u2018there are no tariffs on Bitcoin,\u2019 and noting that spot ETF approvals, U.S. government funding resolution, Federal Reserve rate decisions, and geopolitical tensions\u2014such as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire\u2014could influence future price movements.

Over 1.62 Million Traders Liquidated Amid Cryptocurrency Meltdown**\nIn the context of unpredictable U.S. tariff policies and a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown, the highly speculative cryptocurrency market experienced a sharp downturn on October 11, 2025. Bitcoin plunged nearly 15% at one point, Ethereum dropped over 20%, and smaller-cap cryptocurrencies also suffered steep losses. The rapid decline triggered over $19 billion in global futures contract liquidations within 24 hours, affecting 1.62 million traders, with 90% being long-position liquidations. Analysts attribute the crash primarily to the U.S. misuse of tariff 'sticks,' especially after former President Trump threatened to raise tariffs in response to stricter global rare earth export controls, fueling fears of worsening trade tensions. Additionally, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and cautious signals from Federal Reserve officials contributed to market instability. Despite Bitcoin's earlier surge\u2014rising from around $95,000 in early 2025 to surpassing $120,000 by October\u2014driven by institutional inflows and growing integration with global financial systems, risk assessments remain high. Hargreaves Lansdown, a UK investment giant, warned that Bitcoin's extreme volatility makes it unsuitable for most investment portfolios, citing its history of extreme losses. Conversely, Deutsche Bank believes that amid accelerating de-dollarization and rising safe-haven demand, Bitcoin could become a key component of central bank reserves by 2030, alongside gold. Gold reserves have exceeded 36,000 tons, and gold prices recently surpassed $4,000. Both Bitcoin and gold ETFs have seen record inflows. Bitwise forecasts a 2035 price target of $1.3 million for Bitcoin, driven by institutional demand and its fixed supply, projecting a 28.3% annual compound growth rate over the next decade\u2014far exceeding traditional assets like stocks (6.2%), bonds (4.0%), and gold (3.8%).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 07:24 AM\nSource:[\u626c\u5b50\u7f51\uff08\u626c\u5b50\u665a\u62a5\uff09](https://www.yangtse.com/news/ch/202510/t20251011_274965.html)\n\n**Bitcoin Reaches New All-Time High of $125,000 Amid Surge in Institutional and Global Adoption**\nOn October 5, 2025, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $125,703, surpassing its previous peak of $124,533 set on August 14, 2025. The price had previously corrected below $108,000 before recovering. October has historically been a bullish month for crypto markets, with price increases in 10 of the last 12 years\u2014coined 'Uptober'\u2014and Bitcoin already showed an 8% monthly gain within the first five days of October 2025. Key drivers include expectations of currency devaluation, Federal Reserve rate cuts (with near 100% market confidence in another cut by month-end), and concerns over the independence of the U.S. central bank under pressure from President Donald Trump to ease monetary policy despite inflation above the 2% target. These factors are expected to increase U.S. money supply\u2014already at a record high\u2014further eroding the dollar\u2019s purchasing power. Institutional adoption is accelerating: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted over $3.2 billion in net inflows in one week, and total net inflows since their January 2024 approval have surpassed $60 billion\u2014also a record. Additionally, global adoption is rising: following a directive by U.S. President Donald Trump to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, countries including El Salvador, Bhutan, the UAE, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan have either adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset or are moving toward doing so.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[Overclockers.ru](https://overclockers.ru/blog/kosmos_news/show/240317/Bitkoin-dostig-novogo-istoricheskogo-maksimuma-v-125-000)\n\n**The Crypto State**\nThe article \"The Crypto State\" reports that the cryptocurrency market has rebounded after the 2022 crash, with Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 for the first time in December 2024 and the overall crypto market cap rising from $1.7\u202ftrillion at the end of 2023 to $3.5\u202ftrillion in December 2024 before settling near $2.8\u202ftrillion in early 2025.  The surge was driven in part by the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange\u2011traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024, which attracted about $36\u202fbillion in inflows and lifted BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF to $60\u202fbillion.  The article notes that the Trump administration has pursued a pro\u2011crypto agenda, including an executive order creating a digital\u2011asset working group, dropping investigations into OpenSea and Robinhood, and exempting meme coins such as $Trump from SEC oversight.  It also describes the proposed GENIUS Act, which would lightly regulate stablecoins, and the plan to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that would act as a \"digital Fort Knox\" for the currency.  Lobbying spending by the crypto industry is highlighted, with $133\u202fmillion spent by super PACs in 2024 and $22\u202fmillion in 2022 to defeat tax\u2011reporting proposals.  The article quotes critics such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said, 'Republicans are setting the stage for the richest man in the world to issue his own currency that competes with the US dollar.'  It concludes that the mainstreaming of crypto could increase systemic risk, especially through stablecoins, and that a failure could trigger a run similar to the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse.  The piece is heavily analytical, citing market data, regulatory actions, and political developments, and it frames the Trump\u2011era crypto policy as a significant shift toward deregulation and state endorsement of digital assets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[portside.org](https://portside.org/2025-08-25/crypto-state)\n\n**The US could become a global hub for cryptocurrencies. Here's why**\nAccording to FXStreet, the United States is positioning itself as a global cryptocurrency hub under President Donald Trump. The article cites several policy moves: the GENIUS Act, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Trump\u2011backed ventures such as World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and the meme coin Official Trump (TRUMP), and regulatory appointments that shift the industry away from the Biden\u2011era crackdown. Bitcoin reached a record high of $76,400 on November\u202f6,\u202f2024, the day after the election, and later $109,588 on January\u202f20,\u202f2025, the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Crypto\u2011linked stocks such as Coinbase and Strategy rose alongside the price surge. The SEC Chair Gary Gensler resigned on November\u202f21,\u202f2024, a move that \u2018had a positive impact on the crypto markets,\u2019 according to the article. WLFI tokens are now worth $460.42\u202fmillion, and the project\u2019s stablecoin USD1 is 1:1 backed by the U.S. dollar. The Trump Media and Technology Group filed for a Bitcoin ETF, and the Official Trump coin reached a peak market cap of $8.79\u202fbillion, later falling to $1.62\u202fbillion. The U.S. Department of Justice seized more than $225\u202fmillion in crypto fraud, and the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center reported $5.8\u202fbillion in losses in 2024. State\u2011level initiatives such as New\u202fHampshire\u2019s HB\u202f302, Arizona\u2019s HB\u202f2749, and Texas\u2019s SB\u202f21 create state\u2011run Bitcoin reserves. The GENIUS Act mandates full dollar reserves for stablecoins and is expected to cement the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance, with analysts projecting USD\u2011denominated stablecoins to represent over 99\u202f% of the market. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in August, \u2018We\u2019re going big on digital assets,\u2019 underscoring the administration\u2019s commitment.

Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a strategic reserve by nations and companies. In March 2025, former US President Donald Trump will officially launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the US. Several US states, such as New Hampshire and Arizona, have already passed laws to establish similar reserves, and 17 other states are actively discussing similar proposals. Internationally, Bhutan and El Salvador are also holding significant Bitcoin reserves. Companies such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet are also increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and protection against fiscal instability and fiat devaluation. The experts at 21Shares expect this trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption to continue throughout the year. Additionally, the growth of ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) is driving institutional adoption forward. The managed assets (AUM) of global crypto-ETPs reached a record high of $180 billion by mid-2025, up from $100 billion in December 2024. As regulatory momentum increases, 21Shares remains optimistic. US states are pushing forward laws that allow Bitcoin-ETPs for public fund investments, while the UK is working to lift its ban on retail-ETNs and Japan is proposing reforms to classify digital assets as financial products, potentially making professional crypto-investments more accessible to the general public. Stablecoins are also gaining interest from nations and companies, particularly in emerging markets, as a means of protection against currency fluctuations. The GENIUS Act, a proposed law for comprehensive federal regulation, has bipartisan support in the US and is expected to be implemented soon. Additionally, Hong Kong has introduced a stablecoin sandbox and licensing system, while Thailand is testing a retail-friendly stablecoin on the Baht basis.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 10:03 PM\nSource:[finanzen.net](https://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/devisen/mid-year-review-2025-krypto-ausblick-fuer-den-bitcoin-co-es-wird-noch-spannend-in-2025-14701902)\n\n**Your Weekend Crypto Roundup | August 2025 (Week 1)**\nThe SEC has approved in-kind transactions for Bitcoin and Ether ETPs, allowing authorized participants to transact in crypto assets directly.

The 166-page report addressed regulation, banking access, and tax reform but omitted any mention of government Bitcoin purchases or expansion of the reserve, disappointing crypto advocates. Nevertheless, Bitcoin (BTC) remained resilient, trading at $118,383\u2014near its all-time high of $123,000\u2014after a modest correction. Market indicators show strong bullish momentum: spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $2 billion in inflows within two days in mid-July, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT managing over $80 billion in assets. Institutional holdings now account for approximately 1.4 million BTC (6.6% of total supply). Technical indicators support optimism: the MVRV ratio is near its 365-day average at 2.2, Bollinger Bands are tightening, and the RSI stands at 42.65, suggesting room for upward movement. A breakout above $119,900 could trigger a rapid return to record highs. Trade volume rose 12% in 24 hours to $70.3 billion, and long-term holding behavior indicates sustained investor confidence.

The increase is supported by the 'Crypto Week', where US lawmakers will debate several bills related to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, closed at $119,967.3 per unit, representing a 1.16% increase. Analyst Tony Sycamore said, 'It's mounting a series of tailwinds', citing strong institutional demand, expectations of higher returns, and Trump's support as reasons for optimism. Gildardo Herrera, director of Strategy and Operations for Latin America at Bitget, explained that the movement was driven by optimism around regulatory advances in the US, with Congress. 'The debate of bills are key to the crypto sector, including the CLARITY Act, GENIUS Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. These measures are expected to bring greater regulatory clarity and attract even more institutional capital to the market,' he said. The price of Bitcoin has increased by 28.3% in 2025 and 160.1% since the SEC approved several Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, have also shown positive behavior. The US House of Representatives will debate a series of bills to provide a national regulatory framework for the digital assets sector, which has been demanding it for a long time. President Donald Trump, who has called himself the 'cryptopresident', has urged monetary leaders to renew the rules in favor of the industry. 'It's been a very, very strong move in the last six or seven days, and it's hard to see where it stops now; it seems that it can easily reach the level of $125,000,' Sycamore said. Bitcoin ETFs have risen by up to 175% since their listing on the stock exchange, while Ethereum ETFs have not been as fortunate, showing a decline since their debut.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/mercados/bitcoin-llego-123-000-dolares-activada-crypto-week-20250714-768162.html)\n\n**Bitcoin on the Brink of a Major Surge: What's Next?**\nBitcoin has seen a significant surge in value, breaking its historical record, amidst political changes, blockchain structural changes, and the influx of large investors. Several key factors have contributed to this growth, including the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the influx of institutional investors, and the accumulation of reserves by El Salvador and Bhutan. The reduction in block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC has also led to a decrease in the supply of new coins, causing the price to rise. The victory of Donald Trump and the nomination of Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency advocate, as SEC head have added to the market's optimism. Historically, after each halving, the price of Bitcoin has increased by 3-5 times, making a potential price of $150,000 in 2025-26 possible. However, the rise in US debt, actions by the Federal Reserve, and global macroeconomic trends may complicate the situation. Key barriers to further growth include the $102,000-$107,000 price range, and the amount of 'hot money' flowing through ETFs will be crucial in determining the continuation of the growth. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and it is recommended to hold a reasonable portion of BTC in a portfolio and be prepared for rapid market fluctuations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 12, 2025 09:07 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/economics/2246207-bitcoin-halving/)\n\n**Bitcoin's Rise: A Global Economic Reality**\nBitcoin has recently surpassed $2.1 trillion in market capitalization, making it one of the richest assets in the world, surpassing tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. According to Visual Capitalist (June 2025), Bitcoin currently ranks fifth in the global list of most capitalized titles, just behind Amazon (~$2.0 trillion), Nvidia (~$2.6 trillion), Microsoft (~$2.8 trillion), and Apple, which leads the list with approximately $3.3 trillion. To put these numbers into perspective, Bitcoin alone represents about 1.3% of the total value of global stock markets, estimated at over $159 trillion (World Federation of Exchanges, 2025). Despite its volatile and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is today an economic entity larger than many national economies, surpassing the nominal GDP of countries like Spain or Mexico. The credit for this rise goes to various factors, including institutional adoption: in January 2024, the SEC's approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs opened the door to large pension funds, banks, and professional investors. Additionally, a political effect: President Donald Trump relaunched the Bitcoin theme in his 2024 campaign and, once back at the White House, signed an executive order to create a 'national strategic reserve in Bitcoin,' promoting the United States as the future 'crypto capital of the world.' A narrative that has also pushed other nations, such as the UK and even China, to publicly declare their possession of BTC reserves (ARK Invest, Glassnode, BitcoinTreasuries.net).\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 23, 2025 02:46 PM\nSource:[Info Data](https://www.infodata.ilsole24ore.com/2025/06/23/quanto-e-grande-bitcoin-rispetto-alle-piu-grandi-aziende-del-mondo/)\n\n**2025: Towards a Democratization of Cryptocurrency Investment?**\nThe year 2025 marks a turning point for cryptocurrency investment, as it becomes more democratized and accessible to a wider audience. Several factors contribute to this trend, including the convergence of economic, technological, and regulatory dynamics. The approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January 2024 paved the way for institutional investors, leading to a significant increase in the price of Bitcoin. After Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election in November 2024, with promises favorable to cryptocurrencies, the price of Bitcoin reached $100,000 in December. In May, it reached a new historical high of $111,878, driven by a renewed optimism around a bipartisan agreement on the project of law regulating stablecoins, expected to be adopted this summer. The ether, the second cryptocurrency by capitalization, also experienced a notable rebound, reaching around $2,500 in late May. However, its price remains around 50% lower than its peaks in late 2024, indicating a partial recovery. The growing interest of institutional investors has played a key role in legitimizing cryptocurrencies for the general public. Heavyweights in asset management, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, have begun to integrate Bitcoin through ETFs following the approval of the first funds of this type in the US in January 2024. BlackRock, which had filed its request in 2023, opened the way for this new form of access, quickly followed by Fidelity and Ark Invest, making it easier for investors to access these digital assets in a safer and more regulated way. A reserve of strategic bitcoins in the US In March, Donald Trump signed a decree aimed at creating a national strategic reserve of bitcoins, confirming his ambition to make the US 'the capital of the world of cryptocurrencies.' This initiative, with strong symbolic value, reinforces the supporters of the integration of Bitcoin into sovereign monetary policies. The US president mentioned five cryptocurrencies he would like to include in this reserve: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. In parallel, the adoption of the FIT21 law (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act) in the House of Representatives contributes to clarifying the rules of the game in the US, defining the respective competences of the SEC and the CFTC on cryptocurrencies. Europe is moving forward with MiCA In Europe, the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation, which came into force at the end of December 2024, aims to provide a harmonized legal framework at the EU level, with common requirements for issuers of digital assets and exchange platforms. This regulatory framework aims to protect investors while encouraging innovation. However, its implementation remains uneven: in France, the AMF has recently deplored a low number of dossiers for the MiCA agreement, mandatory by June 2026. In addition, new access channels and regulated platforms, such as Bitpanda, contribute to opening the crypto universe to a wider and more diverse public. The interest of the general public does not wane. In France, according to the latest survey conducted by Adan with Deloitte and Ipsos, a third of the French people consider investing in 2025, even if the proportion of holders remains stable at 10%. Among them, 94% want to increase their exposure. Despite a delay compared to the UK (19%), the Netherlands (17%), or Italy (15%), the trend is upward, with a 10-point jump in one year in investment intentions.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: June 21, 2025 04:31 PM\nSource:[boursier.com](https://www.boursier.com/crypto-monnaies/actualites/news/2025-vers-une-democratisation-de-l-investissement-crypto-960560.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across twelve expert perspectives, the consensus is that although Bitcoin is currently in a historically strong bull market (trading between $110,000 and $126,000 as of October 2025), the probability of reaching $200,000 on any single day in 2025 is considered low, though not negligible. Experts consistently cite strong bullish fundamentals, including unprecedented institutional inflows via ETFs, supportive U.S. regulatory and political environments (notably the Trump administration's pro-crypto stance and strategic reserve rhetoric), structural supply limitations post-halving, and ongoing global adoption. These factors collectively increase the right-tail probability of a parabolic move.\n\nHowever, most forecasters emphasize significant headwinds: historical price cycles show diminishing returns and the likelihood that the current cycle is peaking; macroeconomic volatility (especially U.S.-China trade tensions, global risk-off events, and stock market corrections) has repeatedly resulted in sharp Bitcoin drawdowns; and technical and psychological resistance at $200k is formidable given the magnitude of move required (a 60\u201380% rally from current ATHs in less than 3 months). Several experts note that institutionalization may actually dampen the probability of late-cycle mania spikes, and high volatility means large moves can occur both up and down.\n\nWhile behavioral and speculative-bubble perspectives allow for the possibility of a blow-off top or black-swan event (such as sudden massive institutional or sovereign buying, or extreme macro shocks), base rates and market maturity argue against it as the central scenario. The most common forecast probabilities cluster in the low double digits (8% to 18%), with the behavioral/speculative bubble perspectives highest at 23% and 25% (one outlier at 32%), reflecting the potential for a sudden, narrative-driven FOMO episode. The lowest forecasts (8%) are from risk-averse, base-rate-driven and valuation model approaches.\n\nIn summary: The most likely scenario is that Bitcoin remains volatile or consolidates below $150k for the rest of 2025, perhaps after a correction. A singular daily high at or above $200k is possible\u2014triggered by a perfect storm of institutional FOMO, policy shock, or macro financial crisis\u2014but such a scenario is not the baseline expectation. The median forecast probability is approximately 18%, with most experts bracketing their calls between 8% and 25%.",
