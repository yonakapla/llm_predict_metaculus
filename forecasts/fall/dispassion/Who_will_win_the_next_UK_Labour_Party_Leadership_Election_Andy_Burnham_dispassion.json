The base rate for a non-MP outsider overcoming all these hurdles is indeed vanishingly small, but the forecaster also fairly acknowledges a narrow window for a 'perfect storm' scenario. This nuanced view properly weights both the status quo bias and the low-probability, high-impact risk of a crisis-driven realignment, supporting a very low\u2014yet nonzero\u2014probability.

The analysis is strengthened by its focus on the sequence of improbable events required for Burnham to even become eligible, let alone win, and rightly situates the current volatility as necessary but not sufficient for overturning the party's traditional approach.

Several forecasters (notably from Elite Theory and UK Political Culture) assign even lower probabilities, emphasizing the base rate of near-zero for a non-MP winning a mid-term party leadership contest. Others (including myself) note that while a perfect storm scenario is theoretically possible\u2014especially if Labour\u2019s polling further collapses and there is a rapid elite or network realignment\u2014such a scenario is both highly contingent and unprecedented.

While some questioned whether the probability should be slightly higher in light of possible elite realignment if polling collapses further and Powell wins the deputy leadership, the consensus is that multiple, independent procedural veto points make even a perfect storm scenario very rare.

After attending the Labour Party conference in Liverpool and later participating in fringe events at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Burnham publicly criticized Keir Starmer\u2019s government and advocated for radical changes, including reforms to council tax. Although he claims he is not plotting a return to Parliament, his actions\u2014such as engaging with media, attending high-profile events, and aligning with the newly formed 'Mainstream' faction\u2014have fueled speculation. Burnham is ineligible to run for Labour leader unless he regains a parliamentary seat, as only sitting MPs are eligible. He would need to resign as mayor and trigger a by-election, a move complicated by concerns over Labour\u2019s electoral prospects and resistance from the Labour National Executive Committee (NEC), which is seen as dominated by Starmer allies. However, internal party dynamics may shift: Lucy Powell, a Burnham ally, is the frontrunner to replace Angela Rayner as deputy leader and would gain NEC membership. A potential NEC realignment, driven by dissatisfaction with the current leadership\u2019s direction and fears of electoral losses in May, could open the door for Burnham\u2019s ambitions. Neal Lawson of Compass, a Burnham supporter, has publicly called for Starmer\u2019s removal and declared Burnham 'the best version of himself now' and capable of leading the party and defeating Nigel Farage. Despite his current focus on Greater Manchester\u2014especially after the Heaton Park synagogue attack\u2014rumors about his political future are expected to resurface as Labour faces a challenging election season.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 07:04 AM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/what-next-for-andy-burnham-32637584)\n\n**The Factory of Perceptions: Starmer's Woes and Media Magnification**\nSir Keir Starmer, following Labour's decisive victory in the July 2024 UK general election, has experienced a rapid decline in political standing, according to the article. Despite initial momentum, Starmer faces mounting criticism from unnamed 'insiders' and party figures, who question his judgment, communication skills, and leadership style, describing him as 'too like a chairman, not a chief executive' and lacking 'emotional connection' with the public. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg reported in late September 2025 that 30 unnamed sources across government and the party were consulted to assess Starmer\u2019s political peril, highlighting widespread concerns over his 'flawed' personnel decisions and policy communication. Media magnification is cited as a key factor in eroding Starmer\u2019s appeal, which was never particularly strong to begin with. Concerns are heightened by the surge of Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which gained 677 councillors in May 2025 and was projected by YouGov to win 311 seats in a hypothetical election, based on a 13,000-person sample. By early October, Reform UK polled at 31%, while Labour trailed at 21%. The article notes that the UK\u2019s First Past the Post system often suppresses challengers, but the current political climate has intensified fears of a Labour collapse. At Labour\u2019s Liverpool party conference, Starmer delivered a 'full-throated defence of progressive values,' with unnamed senior figures praising his 'emotional connection' and 'scrappiness.' Despite this, speculation about a leadership challenge persists, with Andy Burnham and Shabana Mahmood cited as potential contenders.

Neither candidate is from the far left or the New Labour faction, and both are relatively well-known within the party, though less so than outgoing deputy Angela Rayner, who resigned after breaching the ministerial code by failing to pay enough tax on her \u00a3800,000 flat. The deputy leader role lacks a formal job description but includes participation in the National Executive Committee, the political cabinet (a senior party meeting without civil servants), and the weekly parliamentary meeting. The role is not automatically the deputy prime minister\u2014David Lammy holds that position. One source describes the deputy as the 'campaigner in chief,' highlighting its strategic importance ahead of May's elections. Powell, recently sacked from the cabinet without a clear explanation, argues for open debate and a 'course correction' in government, criticizing the perceived clique around Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Her backers claim the party needs a 'yin to the yang' of No 10 to balance power. Phillipson\u2019s team warns that an outspoken deputy could destabilize the government, arguing instead for a quiet, inside advocate who pushes members' interests\u2014especially on poverty\u2014without becoming a lightning rod for dissent. Phillipson promises to increase member involvement by soliciting views every three months via app or website, holding direct online meetings with ministers, and restricting National Policy Forum (NPF) submissions to official party-linked organizations. Powell has stronger backing from constituency parties and affiliated groups like the Society of Labour Lawyers, while Phillipson has more MPs and union support. Despite Powell being the favorite according to most Labour sources and limited polling, the outcome remains uncertain. The contest reflects broader member frustration with Starmer\u2019s leadership and decisions. A Powell win could be seen as a rebuke to Starmer, potentially reinforcing the narrative of his 'non-Midas touch.' The decision will ultimately reflect whether Labour members want a visible, external voice or a discreet, internal advocate. The race has already seen mutual criticism, with Phillipson\u2019s allies accusing Powell of avoiding TV hustings and Powell dismissing claims of divisiveness as 'ridiculous.' Both have campaigned widely across 20+ events. The role of deputy leader has historically varied\u2014from loyal enabler to pressure valve to internal opposition\u2014shaping the dynamics of leadership.

The trial ended with both men being formally declared not guilty, and the Crown Prosecution Service stated that the government had failed to provide evidence that China posed a national security threat during the alleged offences\u2014despite repeated requests. Starmer insists no minister, including Powell, was involved in the decision, attributing the lack of evidence to the previous Conservative government\u2019s stance at the time. However, former officials have questioned the sudden shift in position, and the Conservative Party has criticized Powell, citing his frequent visits to China and advocacy for stronger UK-China ties. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp demanded urgent explanation for the government\u2019s failure to disclose evidence showing China was a threat during 2021\u20132023. Cabinet minister Bridget Phillipson confirmed Starmer\u2019s confidence in Powell during a Sky News interview. Powell has agreed to appear before the national security strategy committee, though the session will be held behind closed doors.

After attending the Labour Party conference in Liverpool and later participating in fringe events at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Burnham publicly criticized Keir Starmer\u2019s government and advocated for radical changes, including reforms to council tax. Although he claims he is not plotting a return to Parliament, his actions\u2014such as engaging with media, attending high-profile events, and aligning with the newly formed 'Mainstream' faction\u2014have fueled speculation. Burnham is ineligible to run for Labour leader unless he regains a parliamentary seat, as only sitting MPs are eligible. He would need to resign as mayor and trigger a by-election, a move complicated by concerns over Labour\u2019s electoral prospects and resistance from the Labour National Executive Committee (NEC), which is seen as dominated by Starmer allies. However, internal party dynamics may shift: Lucy Powell, a Burnham ally, is the frontrunner to replace Angela Rayner as deputy leader and would gain NEC membership. A potential NEC realignment, driven by dissatisfaction with the current leadership\u2019s direction and fears of electoral losses in May, could open the door for Burnham\u2019s ambitions. Neal Lawson of Compass, a Burnham supporter, has publicly called for Starmer\u2019s removal and declared Burnham 'the best version of himself now' and capable of leading the party and defeating Nigel Farage.

Despite initial momentum, Starmer faces mounting criticism from unnamed 'insiders' and party figures, who question his judgment, communication skills, and leadership style, describing him as 'too like a chairman, not a chief executive' and lacking 'emotional connection' with the public. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg reported in late September 2025 that 30 unnamed sources across government and the party were consulted to assess Starmer\u2019s political peril, highlighting widespread concerns over his 'flawed' personnel decisions and policy communication. Media magnification is cited as a key factor in eroding Starmer\u2019s appeal, which was never particularly strong to begin with. Concerns are heightened by the surge of Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which gained 677 councillors in May 2025 and was projected by YouGov to win 311 seats in a hypothetical election, based on a 13,000-person sample. By early October, Reform UK polled at 31%, while Labour trailed at 21%. The article notes that the UK\u2019s First Past the Post system often suppresses challengers, but the current political climate has intensified fears of a Labour collapse. At Labour\u2019s Liverpool party conference, Starmer delivered a 'full-throated defence of progressive values,' with unnamed senior figures praising his 'emotional connection' and 'scrappiness.' Despite this, speculation about a leadership challenge persists, with Andy Burnham and Shabana Mahmood cited as potential contenders. Starmer\u2019s defenders include Fraser Nelson of The Spectator, who counters Farage\u2019s claims of rising crime with data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, showing a four-fifths reduction in crime since 1995.

The motion, passed during the party\u2019s annual conference in Aberdeen, rejected a rebel amendment proposing a 'de facto' referendum model\u2014where a pro-independence majority in the popular vote would automatically trigger independence negotiations\u2014despite its prior advocacy by former leader Nicola Sturgeon, who later called it a 'mistake.' Swinney emphasized the party is 'within touching distance' of the 65-seat threshold, urging a clear message to voters. Depute leader Keith Brown reinforced the need for a 'clear question and clear answer.' The shift reflects renewed confidence after the SNP\u2019s 2024 general election collapse, where it lost 38 of 48 Westminster seats amid criticism of a muddled strategy. Now leading in polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, the party is targeting 'soft yes' supporters who have drifted away.

As the SNP prepares for its conference in Aberdeen, Swinney promoted a new government-produced document claiming an independent Scotland would flourish, though it is described as lacking substantive detail and offering no clear solutions on key issues like currency, EU membership, or securing a second independence referendum (Indyref2). The article notes that Swinney inherited a weakened SNP after Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s resignation and Humza Yousaf\u2019s turbulent leadership, which led to a dramatic loss of seats in the 2024 UK general election\u2014dropping from 48 to just nine MPs. Despite this, the SNP remains on track for another Holyrood win. The article criticizes Swinney\u2019s rhetoric, including his claim that a strong SNP result would force Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign, calling it inconsistent and politically self-serving, especially since Swinney himself did not resign after the 2024 general election defeat. His stance on gender identity, particularly supporting self-ID for trans people, is highlighted as out of step with public opinion, with 60% of voters backing the Supreme Court\u2019s biological definition of sex. The author argues that Swinney\u2019s leadership lacks vision and accountability, and while the SNP may achieve a fifth term due to political instability in Westminster and the rise of Reform UK, Swinney does not deserve such a victory given his failure to deliver a credible path to independence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 02:44 PM\nSource:[The Scotsman](https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/euan-mccolm-fifth-term-for-snp-looks-likely-but-john-swinney-does-not-deserve-it-5355745)\n\n**Bridget Phillipson v Lucy Powell - behind the battle for Labour's number two**\nThe race for Labour's deputy leadership between Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell is a pivotal moment for the party, which is navigating internal discontent following a disappointing performance in the polls just 18 months after a major election victory.

The rebels' plan, backed by nine SNP branches, calls for independence-supporting parties\u2014including Alba and the Greens\u2014to initiate divorce negotiations with the UK if they collectively win a majority of the popular vote, bypassing a formal referendum. Swinney insists that only a clear, constitutionally valid referendum can deliver a legitimate mandate for independence, citing the 2014 precedent and the need for domestic and international legitimacy. He dismissed Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s 2022 proposal to use a general election as a de facto referendum, stating it would not work. Swinney also predicted that if the SNP wins a majority in 2026, Keir Starmer would be forced to resign, and his successor would be more likely to allow a new referendum. Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar criticized the SNP for internal divisions over independence while public services, particularly the NHS, face crisis levels, warning that the NHS 'may not survive another five years of SNP incompetence.' Swinney acknowledged the lack of a 'shortcut' to reducing record NHS waiting lists, referencing a Royal College of Emergency Medicine report linking over 800 deaths in Scotland to A&E delays. He also addressed tensions with hospital doctors, as the British Medical Association (BMA) plans a pay strike ballot, despite the Scottish Health Secretary offering 4.25% for 2025\u201326 and 3.75% for 2026\u201327, which nurses accepted.

Speaking ahead of the SNP conference in Aberdeen, Swinney argued that an SNP majority would expose the weakness of Starmer\u2019s leadership and create inevitable instability in the UK government, which he described as already fragile. He emphasized that the SNP\u2019s path to independence requires a clear, agreed-upon process, referencing the 2014 referendum precedent. Swinney opposed an internal SNP amendment proposed by nine branches that would allow the Scottish Government to pursue independence without a new referendum if 50% of list votes support independence, calling the proposal legally questionable and potentially undermining the legitimacy of independence. He stressed that independence must come through a democratic, agreed-upon process, including a referendum. A UK Government spokeswoman dismissed the idea of a new independence referendum as not a priority for Scots, instead promoting the UK\u2019s Plan for Change focused on economic growth, public services, and financial benefits.

This shift comes amid a deepening crisis in electoral, moral, and financial credibility, with Labour's poll ratings dropping from 45% in May 2024 to around 20%, a decline described as unprecedented in scale and speed. Fringe events at the conference featured ministers, MPs, and former advisers openly criticizing the government\u2019s economic challenges and the toxicity of modern politics. Peter Kyle acknowledged public awareness of economic problems, while former adviser Peter Hyman argued that the government should equip citizens with skills for an unstable world rather than promise false security. MPs like Jo White and Jonathan Hinder delivered bold leftwing critiques, calling for an end to the privatization of public services and a return to pro-worker economic values. This internal openness may help salvage the government, though risks include policy contradictions\u2014such as egalitarian rhetoric paired with deference to financial markets and growing authoritarianism toward immigrants. The upcoming budget and May 2026 local elections will be critical tests.

Although Burnham has not explicitly ruled out a challenge, he has framed his recent policy announcements and media appearances as launching a debate rather than a campaign. Rumors have circulated about possible parliamentary vacancies, including from Gorton and Denton MP Andrew Gwynne and Blackley and Middleton South MP Graham Stringer, both of whom have ruled out stepping down. Another possibility is the St Helens seat, where 78-year-old MP Marie Rimmer, who won with a nearly 12,000 majority in 2024, has not indicated any intention to resign. Party insiders believe the biggest obstacle is not winning a by-election\u2014though concerns exist about Labour\u2019s chances amid Reform Party polling leads\u2014but gaining official candidacy approval from the Labour Party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC). The NEC, seen as dominated by Keir Starmer\u2019s allies, is widely expected to block Burnham, possibly citing risks to the Greater Manchester mayoral by-election or disloyalty due to his public criticisms of Starmer. Even if Burnham overcomes these hurdles, he would still need support from enough Labour MPs to trigger a leadership contest, which would then be decided by the party membership.

Starmer, who has been in office for 14 months since Labour's landslide election win, framed the political moment as a 'fork in the road' between Labour's 'renewal' and Reform UK's 'grievance-driven' agenda, calling it 'a fight for the soul of our country.' He acknowledged the path ahead is long, difficult, and requires uncomfortable decisions, but promised a 'fairer country, a land of dignity and respect' in the end.

The upcoming 2026 elections in England, Scotland and Wales could shift the party\u2019s fortunes if voter sentiment turns unfavorable, and analysts predict continued internal discussions unless Starmer\u2019s poll ratings improve.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 05:58 AM\nSource:[Devdiscourse](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/politics/3644486-burnhams-potential-leadership-challenge-sparks-labour-party-tensions)\n\n**PM insists he will lead Labour into next election in swipe at Burnham**\nSir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, declared he will lead the party into the next general election, scheduled for 2029, amid speculation that Greater Manchester mayor Andy\u202fBurnham might challenge him.  In a series of interviews, Starmer said, 'I'm not going to get drawn in to commenting on the personal ambitions of the mayor,' and emphasised that the government\u2019s fiscal rules are a \"foundation stone\" of the administration, warning that abandoning them would harm working people.  He defended the party\u2019s record a year into office and said, 'Yes. I've been very clear that this is a project of national renewal \u2013 a 10\u2011year project,' underscoring his commitment to lead from the front.  Burnham, who has twice failed to win the Labour leadership, accused Starmer of alienating the party and proposed a tax\u2011and\u2011spend manifesto that would raise the top rate of income tax to 50\u202f% and borrow \u00a340\u202fbillion to nationalise housebuilding.  Starmer dismissed the mayor\u2019s ambitions, noting that Burnham\u2019s term as mayor runs until 2028 and that any challenge would require resigning, winning a Westminster seat in a by\u2011election, and receiving nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs.  The article reports that Starmer has faced setbacks, including two high\u2011profile ministerial departures, but maintains that the party\u2019s 10\u2011year renewal plan will continue.  Key metrics cited include the \u00a340\u202fbillion borrowing figure, the 10\u2011year project timeline, and the 2029 election date.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 06:33 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15134499/Keir-Starmer-defiantly-claims-lead-Labour-election-swipes-Andy-Burnhams-economic-plans-Greater-Manchester-mayor-openly-challenges-PM.html)\n\n**Andy Burnham says MPs want him to oust Starmer - four ways he could actually do it**\nAndy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, said Labour MPs are privately urging him to challenge Keir Starmer for the party leadership. He denied plotting to return to Westminster but confirmed his ambition to become prime minister, saying 'I stood twice to be leader of the Labour Party. And I think that tells you, doesn't it?'. The article explains Labour\u2019s leadership rules: a contest is triggered only if the leader resigns or the post is declared vacant; MPs can pass no\u2011confidence motions but they have no constitutional effect. A candidate must secure nominations from at least 10\u202f% of the 399 MPs (i.e., 40 MPs) and then either the backing of 5\u202f% of constituency Labour parties (\u224832 CLPs) or support from at least three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions. The winner is decided by a one\u2011member\u2011one\u2011vote system. Burnham\u2019s main barrier is that he is not an MP; until he wins a seat he cannot stand. The article outlines several routes: winning a by\u2011election after a Labour MP resigns, acting as a kingmaker by endorsing a challenger, or waiting until the next general election to stand as an MP. Each route has procedural hurdles and requires alignment of circumstances. The piece concludes that the cleanest path for Burnham is to become an MP at the next general election, after which he could meet the nomination thresholds and contest the leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/andy-burnham-mps-oust-pm-four-ways-he-could-do-it-3937933)\n\n**Two-horse race for Labour's deputy leadership as Keir Starmer ally Bridget Phillipson is pitted against sacked minister Lucy Powell - who's backed by PM's long-time rival Andy Burnham | Daily Mail Online**\nKeir Starmer\u2019s deputy leadership contest has collapsed to two candidates: Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell. Phillipson, a Cabinet minister, won 116 nominations from Labour MPs, comfortably surpassing the 80\u2011nomination threshold, while Powell, who was sacked as Commons Leader, was three short of the required 80 nominations. Former deputy leaders Emily Thornberry and Paula\u202fBarker withdrew, with Barker endorsing Powell. Bell\u202fRibeiro\u2011Addy failed to reach the 80 nominations and criticised the process, saying 'I am disappointed that the full range of Labour members' views will not be represented on the ballot paper.' The race, which could eclipse Labour\u2019s annual conference, is seen as a test of the party\u2019s direction after Angela Rayner\u2019s resignation. Phillipson is viewed as Downing Street\u2019s de\u2011facto candidate, whereas Powell has backing from Greater Manchester mayor Andy\u202fBurnham, a long\u2011time rival of the Prime Minister.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15089455/Two-horse-race-Labours-deputy-leadership-Keir-Starmer-ally-Bridget-Phillipson-pitted-against-sacked-minister-Lucy-Powell-whos-backed-PMs-long-time-rival-Andy-Burnham.html)\n\n**PM 'trying to 'fix' Labour's deputy leader contest after Rayner exit**\nKeir Starmer is accused of trying to 'fix' the Labour deputy leadership contest after Angela Rayner\u2019s resignation. The party\u2019s NEC is set to decide a successor quickly: candidates must secure 80 MP nominations by 5\u202fpm Thursday, then face a members\u2019 ballot with a winner named by the end of October, well before the Budget on 26\u202fNovember. Backbenchers such as Richard Burgon have condemned the timetable as the \u2018mother of all stitch\u2011ups\u2019, arguing it sidesteps serious discussion of Labour\u2019s failures. Potential candidates include Emily Thornberry, Lucy Powell, Louise Haigh and Shabana Mahmood, while Labour peer Baroness Harman has called for a woman from outside London. The article reports that following Rayner\u2019s resignation, David Lammy became deputy prime minister and Steve Reed took the Housing portfolio. It also notes Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham\u2019s concerns about London\u2011centricity and the need for a northern voice. The piece quotes Burgon, Thornberry, Harman and others, presenting multiple viewpoints without overt editorializing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 09:28 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15076333/Starmer-Rayner-Labour-PM-deputy-leader-MPs-Left.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse set of expert perspectives\u2014including election analysis, political journalism, political science (with focuses on leadership selection, factionalism, and the median voter theorem), social network analysis, elite theory, and UK political culture\u2014there is a strong consensus that Andy Burnham has a very low probability of winning the next UK Labour Party leadership election. The central procedural obstacle is that Burnham is not a sitting MP, which disqualifies him from standing for party leader under current Labour rules. Experts repeatedly highlight that no suitable by-election opportunity is imminent, and that the party's National Executive Committee (NEC), currently controlled by Starmer's allies, is likely to block Burnham's return even if a vacancy arises. While Burnham is popular among grassroots party members and could mount a convincing campaign if he entered parliament, the experts stress that historical base rates for non-MPs winning party leadership mid-term are virtually zero. Additional barriers include the lack of a clear, willing MP to step aside, Burnham's own hesitancy to trigger a risky by-election, and the presence of several alternative contenders who are already MPs. Some scenarios in which Burnham could win require a perfect storm: an acute party crisis (such as catastrophic election results), NEC realignment (possibly via a Lucy Powell deputy leadership win), a sudden safe-seat vacancy, and Burnham quickly securing both a parliamentary seat and MP nominations. However, experts agree that each of these steps is independently unlikely; taken together, the probability remains extremely low. Across all forecasts, final probabilities assigned to Burnham winning range from 2% to 10%, with most congregating between 6% and 7%. The main conclusion is that while Burnham's name will persist in media speculation and internal party chatter, the institutional, procedural, and elite barriers make a Burnham victory highly improbable unless the party faces a truly exceptional crisis and rapidly shifts its internal power structure.",
