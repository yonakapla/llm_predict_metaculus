Even if a lower court were to rule against Musk, the strong likelihood of immediate appeal or stay means the 'not overturned' requirement of the resolution criteria is a high bar by December 31, 2025. The FEC is historically cautious and slow-moving, and the existing record shows ambiguity about whether the giveaway meets the strict legal definition of bribery or illegal inducement under federal law. The status quo favors a No resolution unless there is an unexpectedly rapid, adverse, and unappealed court decision, which is rare in complex, high-profile election law cases. Thus, while legal risk is non-trivial and the controversy is ongoing, the probability that, on December 31, 2025, Musk's initiative will have been definitively and unoverturnedly ruled illegal is low but not zero.",

The status quo is inertia and legal ambiguity; courts are generally cautious about making sweeping findings of election-related illegality absent egregious, direct vote-buying or unequivocal fraud. The fact that a previous court declined to enjoin the giveaway, and that similar cases rarely result in a final, timely illegality ruling, tilts the odds toward a No. However, the present litigation is unusually high-profile, the facts are egregious (multi-million-dollar value, direct linkage to voter registration), and courts have signaled openness to the plaintiffs' claims. I therefore assign a moderately elevated probability to a Yes, higher than base rates but not a majority likelihood.

There is a moderate chance that a lower court issues a ruling before that date, but such a ruling could easily be stayed, appealed, or otherwise not considered 'final' for the purposes of resolution.

Additionally, the facts are egregious enough that a court might be more inclined than usual to issue a summary judgment or preliminary injunction, particularly if discovery yields further damaging evidence.

The facts are egregious and the class action is high-profile, but the procedural history of election law litigation\u2014especially with high-resourced defendants\u2014shows that cases typically drag on well beyond a year, and appeals or stays are almost automatic after any adverse ruling. The requirement that the ruling be 'not overturned' by the resolution date is especially stringent. While your argument for elevating the probability above base rates is compelling, it may not fully account for the slow-moving nature of federal litigation and the legal system\u2019s bias toward caution and delay in politically sensitive matters. A slightly lower probability might better fit the empirical record and the resolution criteria."

The critique underscores the core procedural bottleneck: even in the face of serious legal risk and plausible claims, the timeline for achieving a final, unoverturned court or regulatory ruling remains highly constraining. The ongoing litigation, while significant, is not on track for rapid dispositive resolution, and Musk's resources and right to appeal further diminish the likelihood of finality before year-end. No new evidence or argument from group deliberation justifies raising the probability; if anything, it reinforces the low base rate of such cases being resolved to finality within the timeframe.

This collective skepticism about the pace and finality of the litigation, in light of the strict resolution criteria, is persuasive.

The most persuasive counterargument (from VotingRightsActInterpretation) suggested a higher probability based on the egregious facts and judicial willingness to proceed, but this was effectively countered by forecasters emphasizing the status quo bias and historical base rates.

The defense of my initial reasoning and the consensus that the high-profile nature of the litigation only moderately increases the risk support my prior estimate. However, the strongest counterpoint (from 'ElectionLaw (VotingRightsActInterpretation)') justified a slightly higher probability on the grounds of judicial openness to the claims and the extraordinary nature of the facts.

While I still believe the base rate and procedural barriers remain strong obstacles to a Yes resolution, the convergence of these factors and the consensus among several legal and compliance experts suggests that my initial probability may have underweighted the real, if still minority, chance of a definitive, unoverturned illegality ruling by year-end.

We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million recipient today and tomorrow.\u201d This is a departure from what Musk originally claimed, stating the giveaway was [\u201cgoing to be award[ed] \u2026 randomly to people who have signed the petition\u201d](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crlnjzzk919o) at a campaign event. \nThe giveaway, however, has not been without controversy. After its announcement, Elon Musk and America PAC\u2019s actions came under significant scrutiny. Notably, Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, described the strategy as [\u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and \u201csomething that law enforcement could take a look at.\u201d](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/20/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/elon-musk-money-giveaway-josh-shapiro-00184523) Legal experts have also offered differing opinions on the giveaway\u2019s legality. Richard Hasen, a legal scholar teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles, claimed that the giveaway was [\u201cclearly illegal\u201d](https://x.com/rickhasen/status/1847815868924715295). On the other hand, Bradley Smith, a Professor at Capital University Law School and former Professor at Capital University Law School, argued that whilst he could understand why it could be argued Musk\u2019s tactic has broken the law, ultimately [\u201cthe better catch is that it does not.\"](https://youtu.be/I2eZhYqmP4U?si=XND0WFQdpabyFEjP&t=190) Others still, like Dave Aronberg and Kim Wyman, have stressed that any judgements would be premature, stating that Musk is operating in a [\u201cgray zone\u201d](https://www.newsweek.com/legal-analysts-react-dojs-election-warning-elon-musk-1974003) where [\u201cthe answer is not clear\u201d](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/24/elon-musk-pay-1-million-daily-voters-trump/75822067007/). \nSo far, the giveaway has only resulted in [one lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/28/philadelphia-da-sues-elon-musks-pro-trump-pac-over-1-million-giveaway/). At the end of October, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (a self-described \"progressive prosecutor\") took Musk and America PAC to court, accusing them of hatching an [\u201cillegal lottery scheme to influence voters in that election.\u201d](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13X8d5QADhuuPghc01ousqJeIzxtLO1kc/view?pli=1) However, after lawyers on behalf of Musk and America PAC revealed the giveaway was not a lottery, [Philadelphia Judge Angelo Foglietta refused to impose an injunction and ruled that the giveaway could continue.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/11/04/elon-musk-pacs-1-million-giveaways-upheld-in-court/)\nDespite this, the opposition to Musk\u2019s actions, and the open debate amongst legal experts about the giveaway\u2019s legality, means that the possibility Musk and America PAC may be brought into court in the future cannot be ruled out, leaving the possibility open as to whether it will be ruled illegal.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":30344,\"question_id\":30142}}`",

Thiel warned Musk that if he followed through on the pledge, a large portion of his fortune could go to 'left-wing nonprofits' selected by Gates, whom Musk has publicly disagreed with. Thiel cited actuarial data, calculating that if Musk died within the next year, approximately $1.4 billion could be transferred to Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do -- give it to my children?' and added, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' Thiel also expressed apocalyptic concerns, suggesting that a future 'Antichrist' figure could emerge by exploiting global crises like nuclear war, AI, or climate change to seize power and establish a one-world government. He even speculated whether Donald Trump could be that figure, saying, 'Do you think Trump is the Antichrist? I will give you a hearing. And we should consider that.' Thiel, a longtime supporter of Trump, was one of the first major Silicon Valley figures to back him politically. Musk, who became the first person in history to surpass a $500 billion net worth according to Forbes (though it has since dipped below that threshold), continues to make charitable donations through his Musk Foundation. The Daily Beast has reached out to both Musk and Thiel for comment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 12:32 PM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpy-billionaire-reveals-he-told-musk-not-to-give-his-fortune-to-charity/)\n\n**\u0426\u0418\u041a of Kyrgyzstan Warns Against Premature Campaigning Ahead of November 30, 2025 Parliamentary Elections**\nThe Central Election Commission (\u0426\u0418\u041a) of Kyrgyzstan has reiterated the prohibition of premature campaigning ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections. The early elections for the Jogorku Kenesh are scheduled for November 30, 2025, following the self-dissolution of the parliament. According to \u0426\u0418\u041a, it is illegal to conduct charitable activities, distribute gifts, money, or other material benefits, or engage in covert campaigning before the official announcement of results. The law explicitly forbids vote-buying, the use of religious or ethnic slogans, vilifying opponents, and spreading false information; violations may lead to disqualification of candidates. \u0426\u0418\u041a emphasized that fair competition and strict adherence to electoral legislation are essential for the legitimacy of the elections. The elections will be held under a majoritarian system across 30 multi-member constituencies, electing 90 deputies (three per constituency), with one seat reserved for a woman. Candidates may run either through political parties or as independents. As of October 1, 2025, 4.287 million voters are registered in the country. Preliminary voter lists will be published on the official portal www.tizme.gov.kg on October 8 and posted at polling stations on October 14. Voters can verify their registration online, via phone (1255), SMS to 119, or in person at the polling station. Campaigning will officially begin on November 10 and end one day before voting, at 8:00 a.m. on November 29. Voter applications for voting outside polling stations will be accepted until November 28. Election results will be finalized and officially announced by December 14.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 04:17 AM\nSource:[24.kg](https://24.kg/vlast/346698_tsik_napomnila_ozaprete_dosrochnoy_agitatsii_navyiborah/)\n\n**Tucker Carlson: Americans 'marinate in lies' from Israel's 'incredibly sophisticated propaganda' - LifeSite**\nTucker Carlson delivered a highly critical monologue on October 9, 2025, accusing the U.S.-Israel relationship of being a 'poisonous' and 'client-state' dynamic that has led to decades of American political and media complicity in what he describes as Israel\u2019s 'incredibly sophisticated propaganda.' He argues that the U.S. has been 'humiliated' and 'ordered around' by a 'tiny' nation\u2014Israel, with only nine million people and no meaningful natural resources\u2014despite being the largest recipient of U.S. aid in history, with over $300 billion in aid over 80 years, including $30 billion since October 7, 2023. Carlson claims that Americans are 'marinating in lies' due to systemic censorship and intimidation, with dissenters labeled 'Nazis' or 'antisemites' to silence debate. He criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for interfering in U.S. politics, including pressuring Elon Musk to censor speech on X (Twitter), and for promoting the purchase of TikTok by Zionist billionaires to control American discourse. Carlson calls for restoring U.S. self-respect by ending dependency on Israel, banning dual citizenship, revoking citizenship for Americans fighting for foreign militaries (including in Israel and Ukraine), registering AIPAC under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), and rejecting Christian Zionism as heresy. He asserts that supporting Israel's actions in Gaza\u2014described as a 'massive displacement and killing of unarmed civilians'\u2014violates Christian doctrine, which prohibits the killing of the innocent. According to Carlson, the 'true chosen people' in Christianity are those who choose Jesus, not those by 'DNA,' and any attempt to justify violence in Israel\u2019s name through religious doctrine is heresy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 11:20 PM\nSource:[LifeSiteNews](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/tucker-carlson-americans-marinate-in-lies-from-israels-incredibly-sophisticated-propaganda/)\n\n**Musk's Boasts About Drugs and State Secrets Backfire Spectacularly**\nElon Musk faced a significant legal setback when U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled that his public disclosures on social media\u2014particularly regarding his top-secret security clearance, drug testing, and communications with foreign leaders\u2014waived his right to privacy under the Freedom of Information Act. Cote rejected the Department of Defense\u2019s claim that releasing Musk\u2019s security clearance details would invade his privacy, citing three specific X (formerly Twitter) posts: one from February 2024 stating he had held a top-secret clearance for years, a 2022 post claiming a single conversation with Vladimir Putin about space, and a January 2024 post confirming he agreed to three years of random drug testing at NASA\u2019s request. The judge noted these posts had collectively been viewed over 2 million times, with one reaching 24 million views, establishing that Musk\u2019s public statements outweighed any privacy interest. She ordered the Department of Defense to release the documents, though granted the Trump administration until October 17 to propose redactions. This ruling came amid other legal challenges, including a federal judge denying Musk\u2019s attempt to move an SEC lawsuit over his delayed disclosure of a five-percent stake in Twitter\u2014alleged to have enabled purchases of over $500 million in undervalued shares. Musk, who ended his status as a special government employee in late May 2025, had previously clashed publicly with President Trump, including a controversial post linking Trump\u2019s name to the 'Epstein files,' which Musk later deleted after admitting he had 'gone too far.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 10:30 PM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musks-boasts-about-drugs-and-security-clearances-backfire-spectacularly/)\n\n**Elon Musk: From the Richest Man on Earth to a Poverty Testimony of Our Modern Society**\nElon Musk, who is approaching a net worth of 500 billion dollars and is recognized by Forbes as the richest person on Earth\u2014approximately 150 billion dollars ahead of Larry Ellison\u2014has become a symbol of systemic contradictions in modern capitalism. While his entrepreneurial achievements with Tesla and SpaceX are acknowledged as transformative and the result of intense effort and strategic planning, the article criticizes Musk for his controversial political affiliations, including public admiration for Donald Trump and perceived alignment with right-wing populist movements like the AfD. The author argues that Musk\u2019s immense wealth\u2014enough to erase the debt of entire nations\u2014exposes a broken economic system, especially as millions struggle with basic expenses like electricity bills.

Insights from Past Laureates and Trump's Controversial Candidacy**\nThe 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, worth 11 million Swedish kronor (approximately 967,000 euros), is set to be awarded on October 10, 2025, by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo. A total of 244 individuals and 94 organizations were nominated. Donald Trump has been publicly advocated for by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who claimed Trump 'deserves' the prize due to his efforts in Gaza ceasefire negotiations, though bookmakers assign him low chances of winning. The prize money is not directed by the Nobel Foundation; recipients are free to use it as they see fit. Historically, Peace Prize laureates often donate their winnings to humanitarian causes: Juan Manuel Santos (2016) gave his entire prize to victims of Colombia\u2019s civil war; Barack Obama (2009) distributed funds to war veterans, earthquake victims, and impoverished students; and Dmitry Muratov (2022) auctioned his medal for over 100 million USD, with proceeds going to Ukrainian refugee children via UNICEF. Other laureates have used the money for research (Marie Curie, Swetlana Alexijewitsch), investments (Al Gore), or personal purchases (Paul Nurse\u2019s motorcycle, Franco Modigliani\u2019s yacht). Notably, Albert Einstein promised his future Nobel Prize money to his first wife, Mileva, in his 1919 divorce papers, and reportedly fulfilled the promise. In contrast, Trump has shown no indication of charitable intent\u2014refusing to place gifts like a state aircraft from Qatar into public ownership\u2014raising doubts about his potential use of the prize if awarded. The decision will be announced at 11:00 AM Oslo time on October 10.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:10 PM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/politik/vielen-geld-friedensnobelpreis-2025-was-machen-die-gewinner-mit-dem-93978169.html)\n\n**Instead of Charity, Peter Thiel Told Elon Musk to Use Billions for Right-Wing Crusade Against 'Antichrist' | Common Dreams**\nRight-wing billionaire Peter Thiel urged Elon Musk, during a closed-door event in San Francisco in September 2024, to abandon his commitment to the Giving Pledge\u2014cofounded by Bill Gates\u2014and instead hoard his wealth to prepare for a future 'Antichrist' figure. Thiel warned that Musk\u2019s fortune might otherwise be directed to left-wing nonprofits chosen by Gates, arguing it would be better used to fight a potential global authoritarian regime. Thiel claimed Musk was receptive to this idea. Despite Musk\u2019s public pledges\u2014such as a $6 billion donation of Tesla shares to the UN in 2021\u2014investigations revealed the funds were redirected to Musk\u2019s own foundation, the Musk Foundation, which failed to meet legal charitable donation requirements for three consecutive years. Thiel also labeled environmental activist Greta Thunberg and AI critic Eliezer Yudkowsky as 'legionnaires of the Antichrist,' framing the Antichrist as a 21st-century Luddite opposed to scientific progress. He further expressed frustration with increasing tax surveillance, stating it has made hiding wealth 'quite difficult.' Thiel, a PayPal cofounder and longtime associate of Musk and Vice President JD Vance, has been a major financial backer of conservative political causes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 02:50 PM\nSource:[Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/peter-thiel-antichrist-lecture)\n\n**Peter Thiel Reportedly Warned Elon Musk To Rethink Donating His Wealth: 'Much Worse To Give It To Bill Gates'**\nBillionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel reportedly advised Elon Musk to reconsider leaving the Giving Pledge, a commitment to donate most of one's wealth to charity. Thiel, in a series of lectures in San Francisco, expressed concern about the potential rise of an 'Antichrist' figure who could establish a one-world government by promising to solve global crises like nuclear threats, AI risks, or climate change. Thiel, known as a political benefactor of JD Vance and an early backer of Donald Trump, also shared an anecdote in which he warned Musk that, based on actuarial tables, there was a high statistical likelihood of Musk's death within a year, meaning $1.4 billion could end up with Bill Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do\u2014give it to my children?', to which Thiel replied, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' This exchange reflects the ongoing public feud between Musk and Gates, who have clashed over philanthropy, with Musk criticizing Gates for allegedly shorting Tesla stock and then requesting donations, while Gates criticized Musk\u2019s cuts to federal programs like USAID and PEPFAR. Despite their differences, both remain committed to philanthropy: Musk donated Tesla shares worth over $101 million to charity before 2025, and Gates plans to increase his foundation\u2019s contributions over the next two decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 01:25 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/10/48146278/peter-thiel-reportedly-warned-elon-musk-to-rethink-donating-his-wealth-much-worse-to-give-it-to-bill-gates)\n\n**Trumpy Billionaire Reveals He Told Musk Not to Give His Fortune to Charity**\nAccording to transcripts and audio of lectures reviewed by Reuters, Peter Thiel, a right-wing billionaire and co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, urged Elon Musk to reconsider his commitment to the Giving Pledge\u2014a philanthropic initiative co-founded by Bill Gates in 2010 that calls for wealthy individuals to donate a significant portion of their wealth to charity. Thiel warned Musk that if he followed through on the pledge, a large portion of his fortune could go to 'left-wing nonprofits' selected by Gates, whom Musk has publicly disagreed with. Thiel cited actuarial data, calculating that if Musk died within the next year, approximately $1.4 billion could be transferred to Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do -- give it to my children?' and added, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' Thiel also expressed apocalyptic concerns, suggesting that a future 'Antichrist' figure could emerge by exploiting global crises like nuclear war, AI, or climate change to seize power and establish a one-world government. He even speculated whether Donald Trump could be that figure, saying, 'Do you think Trump is the Antichrist? I will give you a hearing. And we should consider that.' Thiel, a longtime supporter of Trump, was one of the first major Silicon Valley figures to back him politically. Musk, who became the first person in history to surpass a $500 billion net worth according to Forbes (though it has since dipped below that threshold), continues to make charitable donations through his Musk Foundation.

He argues that the U.S. has been 'humiliated' and 'ordered around' by a 'tiny' nation\u2014Israel, with only nine million people and no meaningful natural resources\u2014despite being the largest recipient of U.S. aid in history, with over $300 billion in aid over 80 years, including $30 billion since October 7, 2023. Carlson claims that Americans are 'marinating in lies' due to systemic censorship and intimidation, with dissenters labeled 'Nazis' or 'antisemites' to silence debate. He criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for interfering in U.S. politics, including pressuring Elon Musk to censor speech on X (Twitter), and for promoting the purchase of TikTok by Zionist billionaires to control American discourse. Carlson calls for restoring U.S. self-respect by ending dependency on Israel, banning dual citizenship, revoking citizenship for Americans fighting for foreign militaries (including in Israel and Ukraine), registering AIPAC under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), and rejecting Christian Zionism as heresy. He asserts that supporting Israel's actions in Gaza\u2014described as a 'massive displacement and killing of unarmed civilians'\u2014violates Christian doctrine, which prohibits the killing of the innocent.

Cote rejected the Department of Defense\u2019s claim that releasing Musk\u2019s security clearance details would invade his privacy, citing three specific X (formerly Twitter) posts: one from February 2024 stating he had held a top-secret clearance for years, a 2022 post claiming a single conversation with Vladimir Putin about space, and a January 2024 post confirming he agreed to three years of random drug testing at NASA\u2019s request. The judge noted these posts had collectively been viewed over 2 million times, with one reaching 24 million views, establishing that Musk\u2019s public statements outweighed any privacy interest. She ordered the Department of Defense to release the documents, though granted the Trump administration until October 17 to propose redactions. This ruling came amid other legal challenges, including a federal judge denying Musk\u2019s attempt to move an SEC lawsuit over his delayed disclosure of a five-percent stake in Twitter\u2014alleged to have enabled purchases of over $500 million in undervalued shares.

The suit was filed by U.S. citizen Jacqueline Macaverty on November\u202f5, 2024, claiming that Musk and his affiliated political action committee encouraged voters in swing states to sign a petition in exchange for a daily $1\u202fmillion prize, but that winners never received the money and personal data were collected.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, invokes the Class Action Fairness Act and alleges that the total value of all class members\u2019 claims exceeds $5\u202fmillion. It seeks damages and injunctive relief on behalf of petition signers who say they were wrongly induced to provide personal identifying information when signing the petition. The complaint names Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty as lead plaintiff and alleges that America PAC and Musk induced voters in seven battleground states\u2014Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina\u2014to sign a petition supporting free speech and Second Amendment positions by promising $1\u202fmillion daily prizes chosen \u2018randomly\u2019 until Election Day. The suit says petition signers were required to provide names, addresses, emails and phone numbers and that the defendants benefited by driving traffic to X, Musk\u2019s social platform, and by collecting valuable political contact data. It also alleges that the lottery was not random, giving voters no real chance to collect. In November, Musk\u2019s lawyers told a Pennsylvania judge that winners were not chosen at random but were selected in advance\u2014contradicting Musk\u2019s own statements when he launched the contest. U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman ruled that McAferty plausibly alleged that she had been misled and that an expert could testify about the commercial value of battleground voters\u2019 contact information.

The plaintiff, Jacqueline McAferty of Arizona, claims that winners were pre\u2011selected, contrary to Musk\u2019s promotion of the giveaway as a lottery. U.S. District Judge Robert\u202fPitman in Austin, Texas, ruled that McAferty\u2019s proposed class action against Musk and his political group, America\u202fPAC, is valid. McAferty also alleges that America\u202fPAC unlawfully collected her personal details during the giveaway in the final stretch of the 2024 election campaign.

Musk requested a judge to dismiss the lawsuit in January, stating that he had not organized an 'illegal' giveaway. However, a US federal judge ruled on August 20 that Musk must face the voters' legal challenge. US District Judge Robert Pitman stated in the ruling that Arizona voter Jacqueline McAferty had reasonably alleged that Musk and 'America PAC' misled her into providing personal information to participate in the giveaway by signing a petition in support of the US Constitution. McAferty alleged that Musk and America PAC lured seven swing state voters into signing the petition, promising to randomly select a daily $1 million winner, but the voters had no real chance of winning. She stated that the voters who signed the petition were asked to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Musk stated in January that the daily $1 million winner was 'selected to earn' the money, and the organizers of the activity had informed the voters that they would be reviewed to see if they could become a spokesperson for America PAC and earn $1 million. Therefore, he did not believe that the money was a prize. However, the judge pointed out that the plaintiff's statements showed that the defendants had 'awarded' $1 million, and that the money could be 'won.' The ruling stated: 'The plaintiff has a reasonable basis to rely on these statements, believing that the defendant objectively provided her with the opportunity to participate in a random draw -- even if the defendant subjectively did not intend to do so.' Regarding Musk's denial of the voters' claim that they were harmed by providing contact information. Judge Pitman stated that a political data intermediary expert could testify that the information was valuable to swing state voters.

Musk requested the judge to dismiss the lawsuit in January, stating that he did not host an 'illegal' lottery. However, a US federal judge ruled on August 20 that Musk must face the legal challenge. US District Court Judge Robert Pitman stated in the ruling that Arizona voter Jacqueline McAferty had reasonably alleged that Musk and 'America PAC' misled her into providing personal information to participate in the lottery. McAferty alleged that Musk and America PAC lured voters from seven swing states to sign a petition in support of the US Constitution, promising to randomly select a daily winner of $1 million, but in reality, voters had no chance of winning. She stated that voters who signed the petition were asked to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Musk stated in January that the daily $1 million winner was 'selected to earn' this amount, and the organizers had informed voters that they would be reviewed to see if they could become a spokesperson for America PAC and receive $1 million. Therefore, he did not consider this money to be a lottery prize. However, the judge pointed out that the plaintiff's statements showed that the defendants 'awarded' $1 million, and this money could be 'won.' The ruling stated: 'The plaintiff has a reasonable basis to rely on these statements, believing that the defendant objectively provided her with the opportunity to participate in a random lottery -- even if the defendant subjectively did not intend to do so.' The judge also stated that a political data intermediary expert can testify that these data are valuable to voters in swing states. Musk and America PAC's lawyers have not commented on the latest ruling. This case is 'McAferty v Musk,' US District Court for the Western District of Texas, case number 24-01346. A Philadelphia judge refused to stop Musk's lottery on the eve of the election, citing that the city's district attorney failed to prove it was an illegal lottery.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 06:41 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/8/21/n14577994.htm)\n\n**Elon Musk Must Face Lawsuit Over Alleged Voter Data Collection and Misleading Giveaway**\nBillionaire Elon Musk must face a lawsuit filed by voters who claim they were misled by him. According to the plaintiffs, this occurred during a daily giveaway of $1 million (approximately \u20ac850,000), organized by Musk in the run-up to the recent US presidential election. A judge ruled that the complaint makes it plausible that the winners of the disputed action were not chosen randomly, but by Musk's employees. Musk wanted the case to be dismissed, but the judge has allowed it to proceed. The plaintiffs claim that Musk and his political action committee America PAC collected voter data for Trump's presidential campaign through the action, which also aimed to drive traffic to Musk's platform X. Musk had promised to pay $1 million daily to someone who signed an online petition in support of the US Constitution. However, during a previous pre-trial hearing, Musk's lawyers confirmed that the selection was not random, while Musk publicly spoke about 'randomly' distributing the money. According to the judge, this could have given voters the impression that it was a real lottery. The action targeted voters in seven swing states crucial for Trump's re-election. Signers were required to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Through a collective claim, the voters are seeking at least $5 million in damages.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 04:36 AM\nSource:[Brabants Dagblad](https://www.bd.nl/buitenland/elon-musk-moet-zich-voor-de-rechter-verantwoorden-over-geldweggeefactie-rond-verkiezingen~a6d81bd6/)\n\n**Elon Musk Faces Lawsuit Over Sweepstakes-Style Giveaway During 2024 US Presidential Election**\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest man, has been sued over a sweepstakes-style giveaway that he ran during the 2024 US presidential election. US District Judge Robert Pitman has ruled that Musk must face the lawsuit. According to Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that Musk and his political action committee, America PAC, used the giveaway to encourage voters to sign a petition in support of the US Constitution and collect their personal information. The lawsuit claims that Musk and America PAC ran the giveaway in seven key swing states, promising to randomly select a winner each day who would receive a $1 million prize, 'like a lottery', but in reality, participants had 'almost no chance of actually winning'. The lawsuit also alleges that signers of the petition were required to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Musk had previously established America PAC to support Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. The organization was accused of using the prize promise to boost the number of petition signatures. Musk's lawyers had previously asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing 'obvious flaws' in the allegations, but Judge Pitman did not accept the motion and ruled that the lawsuit would continue. As of now, Musk's lawyers have not responded to media requests for comment. As the actual controller of Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk's public image is closely tied to his companies. This negative political news, which involves allegations of election fraud, may damage consumer trust in his brands and raise concerns among some investors and business partners. The case is ongoing.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 03:08 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8lziPLVxJjv)\n\n**Elon Musk Must Face Lawsuit Over Alleged Fraud in Giveaway**\nA US federal court has ruled that Elon Musk must face a lawsuit alleging fraud related to a giveaway. Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, sided with plaintiff Jacqueline McAferty, who claims Musk and his political action committee America PAC misled voters into providing personal data. Musk had founded America PAC to support Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. He announced in October that he would give away $1 million daily to those who signed a petition and were registered voters in one of seven key swing states. McAferty said Musk and America PAC lured voters into signing the petition by promising they could win $1 million, but the signers had no real chance of receiving the money. They were also required to provide names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. Musk had argued that the giveaway was not an illegal lottery, as the winners were chosen to 'earn' the money and were expected to serve as spokespeople for the committee. However, the judge rejected this argument, citing other statements from Musk that suggested the money was 'given' and 'won.' McAferty's lawyer said, 'It is plausible that the plaintiff relied on these statements.' Musk had also denied that the signers of the petition suffered any harm from providing their contact information. Pitman said an expert on political data brokerage could testify about the value of this information for voters in the contested states. The lawsuit was filed on election day, November 5, 2024.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 02:19 AM\nSource:[ZEIT ONLINE](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2025-08/elon-musk-betrugsvorwuerfe-usa-wahlkampf)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters broadly agree that by December 31, 2025, it is unlikely that Elon Musk\u2019s million-dollar voter registration giveaway will be definitively ruled illegal by a U.S. court or regulatory body with no overturn or stay in effect. While there is significant ongoing litigation\u2014including a federal class action allowed to proceed, and mounting political and media pressure\u2014the process of achieving a final, standing ruling is slow, especially in a high-profile, legally ambiguous case. Most experts point to relevant U.S. election statutes that prohibit giving something of value for voting or registration and acknowledge plausible legal jeopardy. However, the status quo is that no court has made a final adverse ruling, and base rates for similar high-profile campaign incentives being ruled definitively illegal within a year are low. Legal standards are contested, and the evolving justifications for the giveaway (random lottery versus spokesperson selection) muddy the waters further. Even if an adverse lower court ruling occurs before December 31, 2025, appeals or stays are likely, and the question\u2019s resolution criteria require that such a decision not be overturned. Expert forecasts for a 'Yes' outcome (illegality ruled and not overturned) range from 12% to 35%, with most clustering in the 12%\u201323% range. The consensus is that litigation will likely continue into 2026 or later, with no final, unoverturned finding of illegality by the cutoff date.",
