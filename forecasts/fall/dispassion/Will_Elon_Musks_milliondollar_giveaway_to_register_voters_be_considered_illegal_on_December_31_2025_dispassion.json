The fact that courts have allowed fraud claims to proceed increases legal risk, but, as of October 2025, no court has ruled the giveaway illegal, and the only prior judicial decision (Pennsylvania) declined to enjoin the contest.

In the one instance where an injunction was sought, the court refused to halt the giveaway. While Judge Pitman found the plaintiffs\u2019 claims plausible and allowed discovery, this is a procedural step, not a merits ruling. For this question to resolve 'Yes,' a clear, standing ruling of illegality must exist on December 31, 2025 (not just pending litigation, not just a lawsuit being allowed to proceed, and not just damages for fraud or data misuse unless explicitly tied to the illegality of the giveaway itself). Given the timelines of U.S. court proceedings, especially for high-profile, well-funded defendants, and the fact that courts are still in the evidence/discovery phase, it is unlikely (though not impossible) that such a final, standing illegality ruling will exist by the resolution date. There is nonzero risk, because the factual record (Musk\u2019s own statements, contradictory representations about randomness, data collection) is quite unfavorable, and a judge could issue summary judgment or a decision on the merits if the case proceeds quickly. However, the incentives for the system still lean toward slow resolution, and the status quo is inertia. I therefore assign a moderate but sub-evens probability, reflecting increased risk due to legal vulnerability but not a base expectation of a 'Yes' outcome.",

The consensus among legal specialists and political scientists is that, while the legal risk is real due to ongoing litigation and plausible claims, the probability of a final, standing, unoverturned ruling of illegality by December 31, 2025, remains low. Several forecasters (including those with expertise in campaign compliance and election law doctrine) assigned slightly higher probabilities, but their reasoning often overstates the likelihood that litigation will move unusually quickly or that a ruling will not be stayed or appealed.

Most other domain experts also assign probabilities in the 8-25% range, citing the slow pace of litigation and high bar for a final, unappealed ruling in high-profile, ambiguous election law cases. While I still think the risk is higher than the pure historical base rate due to the live plausibility and seriousness of the claims, I am persuaded to move my probability downward to better reflect the extremely high likelihood of procedural delay or stay, even if an initial adverse merits ruling occurs.",

The majority, including the forecasters with expertise in FEC regulations and Voting Rights Act interpretation, highlight the procedural drag and high likelihood that any adverse ruling would be stayed or appealed. No new information from the discussion suggests an imminent, standing illegality ruling is more likely than I previously judged.

While I argued for a moderately elevated risk due to the seriousness of the allegations and the live nature of the claims, I recognize that my initial probability may slightly overweight the scenario where a final, unoverturned ruling emerges within the short remaining window. In light of these strong procedural arguments and the status quo bias, I am lowering my forecast to 28%, which better reflects the empirical base rate, the high likelihood of delay or stay, and the lack (so far) of any merits-based ruling.

The critiques and defenses exchanged reinforced the central points: while legal risk is real and a summary judgment is possible, the procedural inertia and high likelihood of a stay or appeal make it very unlikely that a Yes resolution will occur within the time frame. The only substantial argument for a higher probability centered on the possibility of rapid summary judgment\u2014however, given the procedural safeguards and Musk's resources, I still assess that such a ruling would almost certainly be stayed or appealed before the resolution date.

The only argument for a moderately higher probability comes from the recognition of heightened legal peril due to Musk's contradictory statements and expedited initial rulings, but even the most bullish forecasts do not exceed the mid-30s and are generally seen as overestimating tail risk.

We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million recipient today and tomorrow.\u201d This is a departure from what Musk originally claimed, stating the giveaway was [\u201cgoing to be award[ed] \u2026 randomly to people who have signed the petition\u201d](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crlnjzzk919o) at a campaign event. \nThe giveaway, however, has not been without controversy. After its announcement, Elon Musk and America PAC\u2019s actions came under significant scrutiny. Notably, Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, described the strategy as [\u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and \u201csomething that law enforcement could take a look at.\u201d](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/20/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/elon-musk-money-giveaway-josh-shapiro-00184523) Legal experts have also offered differing opinions on the giveaway\u2019s legality. Richard Hasen, a legal scholar teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles, claimed that the giveaway was [\u201cclearly illegal\u201d](https://x.com/rickhasen/status/1847815868924715295). On the other hand, Bradley Smith, a Professor at Capital University Law School and former Professor at Capital University Law School, argued that whilst he could understand why it could be argued Musk\u2019s tactic has broken the law, ultimately [\u201cthe better catch is that it does not.\"](https://youtu.be/I2eZhYqmP4U?si=XND0WFQdpabyFEjP&t=190) Others still, like Dave Aronberg and Kim Wyman, have stressed that any judgements would be premature, stating that Musk is operating in a [\u201cgray zone\u201d](https://www.newsweek.com/legal-analysts-react-dojs-election-warning-elon-musk-1974003) where [\u201cthe answer is not clear\u201d](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/24/elon-musk-pay-1-million-daily-voters-trump/75822067007/). \nSo far, the giveaway has only resulted in [one lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/28/philadelphia-da-sues-elon-musks-pro-trump-pac-over-1-million-giveaway/). At the end of October, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (a self-described \"progressive prosecutor\") took Musk and America PAC to court, accusing them of hatching an [\u201cillegal lottery scheme to influence voters in that election.\u201d](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13X8d5QADhuuPghc01ousqJeIzxtLO1kc/view?pli=1) However, after lawyers on behalf of Musk and America PAC revealed the giveaway was not a lottery, [Philadelphia Judge Angelo Foglietta refused to impose an injunction and ruled that the giveaway could continue.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/11/04/elon-musk-pacs-1-million-giveaways-upheld-in-court/)\nDespite this, the opposition to Musk\u2019s actions, and the open debate amongst legal experts about the giveaway\u2019s legality, means that the possibility Musk and America PAC may be brought into court in the future cannot be ruled out, leaving the possibility open as to whether it will be ruled illegal.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":30344,\"question_id\":30142}}`",

Thiel warned Musk that if he followed through on the pledge, a large portion of his fortune could go to 'left-wing nonprofits' selected by Gates, whom Musk has publicly disagreed with. Thiel cited actuarial data, calculating that if Musk died within the next year, approximately $1.4 billion could be transferred to Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do -- give it to my children?' and added, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' Thiel also expressed apocalyptic concerns, suggesting that a future 'Antichrist' figure could emerge by exploiting global crises like nuclear war, AI, or climate change to seize power and establish a one-world government. He even speculated whether Donald Trump could be that figure, saying, 'Do you think Trump is the Antichrist? I will give you a hearing. And we should consider that.' Thiel, a longtime supporter of Trump, was one of the first major Silicon Valley figures to back him politically. Musk, who became the first person in history to surpass a $500 billion net worth according to Forbes (though it has since dipped below that threshold), continues to make charitable donations through his Musk Foundation. The Daily Beast has reached out to both Musk and Thiel for comment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 12:32 PM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpy-billionaire-reveals-he-told-musk-not-to-give-his-fortune-to-charity/)\n\n**\u0426\u0418\u041a of Kyrgyzstan Warns Against Premature Campaigning Ahead of November 30, 2025 Parliamentary Elections**\nThe Central Election Commission (\u0426\u0418\u041a) of Kyrgyzstan has reiterated the prohibition of premature campaigning ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections. The early elections for the Jogorku Kenesh are scheduled for November 30, 2025, following the self-dissolution of the parliament. According to \u0426\u0418\u041a, it is illegal to conduct charitable activities, distribute gifts, money, or other material benefits, or engage in covert campaigning before the official announcement of results. The law explicitly forbids vote-buying, the use of religious or ethnic slogans, vilifying opponents, and spreading false information; violations may lead to disqualification of candidates. \u0426\u0418\u041a emphasized that fair competition and strict adherence to electoral legislation are essential for the legitimacy of the elections. The elections will be held under a majoritarian system across 30 multi-member constituencies, electing 90 deputies (three per constituency), with one seat reserved for a woman. Candidates may run either through political parties or as independents. As of October 1, 2025, 4.287 million voters are registered in the country. Preliminary voter lists will be published on the official portal www.tizme.gov.kg on October 8 and posted at polling stations on October 14. Voters can verify their registration online, via phone (1255), SMS to 119, or in person at the polling station. Campaigning will officially begin on November 10 and end one day before voting, at 8:00 a.m. on November 29. Voter applications for voting outside polling stations will be accepted until November 28.

He argues that the U.S. has been 'humiliated' and 'ordered around' by a 'tiny' nation\u2014Israel, with only nine million people and no meaningful natural resources\u2014despite being the largest recipient of U.S. aid in history, with over $300 billion in aid over 80 years, including $30 billion since October 7, 2023. Carlson claims that Americans are 'marinating in lies' due to systemic censorship and intimidation, with dissenters labeled 'Nazis' or 'antisemites' to silence debate. He criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for interfering in U.S. politics, including pressuring Elon Musk to censor speech on X (Twitter), and for promoting the purchase of TikTok by Zionist billionaires to control American discourse. Carlson calls for restoring U.S. self-respect by ending dependency on Israel, banning dual citizenship, revoking citizenship for Americans fighting for foreign militaries (including in Israel and Ukraine), registering AIPAC under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), and rejecting Christian Zionism as heresy. He asserts that supporting Israel's actions in Gaza\u2014described as a 'massive displacement and killing of unarmed civilians'\u2014violates Christian doctrine, which prohibits the killing of the innocent. According to Carlson, the 'true chosen people' in Christianity are those who choose Jesus, not those by 'DNA,' and any attempt to justify violence in Israel\u2019s name through religious doctrine is heresy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 11:20 PM\nSource:[LifeSiteNews](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/tucker-carlson-americans-marinate-in-lies-from-israels-incredibly-sophisticated-propaganda/)\n\n**Musk's Boasts About Drugs and State Secrets Backfire Spectacularly**\nElon Musk faced a significant legal setback when U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled that his public disclosures on social media\u2014particularly regarding his top-secret security clearance, drug testing, and communications with foreign leaders\u2014waived his right to privacy under the Freedom of Information Act. Cote rejected the Department of Defense\u2019s claim that releasing Musk\u2019s security clearance details would invade his privacy, citing three specific X (formerly Twitter) posts: one from February 2024 stating he had held a top-secret clearance for years, a 2022 post claiming a single conversation with Vladimir Putin about space, and a January 2024 post confirming he agreed to three years of random drug testing at NASA\u2019s request. The judge noted these posts had collectively been viewed over 2 million times, with one reaching 24 million views, establishing that Musk\u2019s public statements outweighed any privacy interest. She ordered the Department of Defense to release the documents, though granted the Trump administration until October 17 to propose redactions. This ruling came amid other legal challenges, including a federal judge denying Musk\u2019s attempt to move an SEC lawsuit over his delayed disclosure of a five-percent stake in Twitter\u2014alleged to have enabled purchases of over $500 million in undervalued shares. Musk, who ended his status as a special government employee in late May 2025, had previously clashed publicly with President Trump, including a controversial post linking Trump\u2019s name to the 'Epstein files,' which Musk later deleted after admitting he had 'gone too far.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 10:30 PM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musks-boasts-about-drugs-and-security-clearances-backfire-spectacularly/)\n\n**Elon Musk: From the Richest Man on Earth to a Poverty Testimony of Our Modern Society**\nElon Musk, who is approaching a net worth of 500 billion dollars and is recognized by Forbes as the richest person on Earth\u2014approximately 150 billion dollars ahead of Larry Ellison\u2014has become a symbol of systemic contradictions in modern capitalism. While his entrepreneurial achievements with Tesla and SpaceX are acknowledged as transformative and the result of intense effort and strategic planning, the article criticizes Musk for his controversial political affiliations, including public admiration for Donald Trump and perceived alignment with right-wing populist movements like the AfD. The author argues that Musk\u2019s immense wealth\u2014enough to erase the debt of entire nations\u2014exposes a broken economic system, especially as millions struggle with basic expenses like electricity bills. The piece contends that Musk\u2019s rise is not a triumph of merit but a societal failure: a man with questionable character and conduct has amassed unprecedented power, and the public may ultimately bear the cost of his 'delusional visions.' The article concludes that Musk\u2019s status as the world\u2019s richest person is not a cause for celebration but an indictment of contemporary society.

A total of 244 individuals and 94 organizations were nominated. Donald Trump has been publicly advocated for by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who claimed Trump 'deserves' the prize due to his efforts in Gaza ceasefire negotiations, though bookmakers assign him low chances of winning. The prize money is not directed by the Nobel Foundation; recipients are free to use it as they see fit. Historically, Peace Prize laureates often donate their winnings to humanitarian causes: Juan Manuel Santos (2016) gave his entire prize to victims of Colombia\u2019s civil war; Barack Obama (2009) distributed funds to war veterans, earthquake victims, and impoverished students; and Dmitry Muratov (2022) auctioned his medal for over 100 million USD, with proceeds going to Ukrainian refugee children via UNICEF. Other laureates have used the money for research (Marie Curie, Swetlana Alexijewitsch), investments (Al Gore), or personal purchases (Paul Nurse\u2019s motorcycle, Franco Modigliani\u2019s yacht). Notably, Albert Einstein promised his future Nobel Prize money to his first wife, Mileva, in his 1919 divorce papers, and reportedly fulfilled the promise. In contrast, Trump has shown no indication of charitable intent\u2014refusing to place gifts like a state aircraft from Qatar into public ownership\u2014raising doubts about his potential use of the prize if awarded. The decision will be announced at 11:00 AM Oslo time on October 10.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:10 PM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/politik/vielen-geld-friedensnobelpreis-2025-was-machen-die-gewinner-mit-dem-93978169.html)\n\n**Instead of Charity, Peter Thiel Told Elon Musk to Use Billions for Right-Wing Crusade Against 'Antichrist' | Common Dreams**\nRight-wing billionaire Peter Thiel urged Elon Musk, during a closed-door event in San Francisco in September 2024, to abandon his commitment to the Giving Pledge\u2014cofounded by Bill Gates\u2014and instead hoard his wealth to prepare for a future 'Antichrist' figure. Thiel warned that Musk\u2019s fortune might otherwise be directed to left-wing nonprofits chosen by Gates, arguing it would be better used to fight a potential global authoritarian regime. Thiel claimed Musk was receptive to this idea. Despite Musk\u2019s public pledges\u2014such as a $6 billion donation of Tesla shares to the UN in 2021\u2014investigations revealed the funds were redirected to Musk\u2019s own foundation, the Musk Foundation, which failed to meet legal charitable donation requirements for three consecutive years. Thiel also labeled environmental activist Greta Thunberg and AI critic Eliezer Yudkowsky as 'legionnaires of the Antichrist,' framing the Antichrist as a 21st-century Luddite opposed to scientific progress. He further expressed frustration with increasing tax surveillance, stating it has made hiding wealth 'quite difficult.' Thiel, a PayPal cofounder and longtime associate of Musk and Vice President JD Vance, has been a major financial backer of conservative political causes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 02:50 PM\nSource:[Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/peter-thiel-antichrist-lecture)\n\n**Peter Thiel Reportedly Warned Elon Musk To Rethink Donating His Wealth: 'Much Worse To Give It To Bill Gates'**\nBillionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel reportedly advised Elon Musk to reconsider leaving the Giving Pledge, a commitment to donate most of one's wealth to charity. Thiel, in a series of lectures in San Francisco, expressed concern about the potential rise of an 'Antichrist' figure who could establish a one-world government by promising to solve global crises like nuclear threats, AI risks, or climate change. Thiel, known as a political benefactor of JD Vance and an early backer of Donald Trump, also shared an anecdote in which he warned Musk that, based on actuarial tables, there was a high statistical likelihood of Musk's death within a year, meaning $1.4 billion could end up with Bill Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do\u2014give it to my children?', to which Thiel replied, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' This exchange reflects the ongoing public feud between Musk and Gates, who have clashed over philanthropy, with Musk criticizing Gates for allegedly shorting Tesla stock and then requesting donations, while Gates criticized Musk\u2019s cuts to federal programs like USAID and PEPFAR. Despite their differences, both remain committed to philanthropy: Musk donated Tesla shares worth over $101 million to charity before 2025, and Gates plans to increase his foundation\u2019s contributions over the next two decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 01:25 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/10/48146278/peter-thiel-reportedly-warned-elon-musk-to-rethink-donating-his-wealth-much-worse-to-give-it-to-bill-gates)\n\n**Trumpy Billionaire Reveals He Told Musk Not to Give His Fortune to Charity**\nAccording to transcripts and audio of lectures reviewed by Reuters, Peter Thiel, a right-wing billionaire and co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, urged Elon Musk to reconsider his commitment to the Giving Pledge\u2014a philanthropic initiative co-founded by Bill Gates in 2010 that calls for wealthy individuals to donate a significant portion of their wealth to charity. Thiel warned Musk that if he followed through on the pledge, a large portion of his fortune could go to 'left-wing nonprofits' selected by Gates, whom Musk has publicly disagreed with. Thiel cited actuarial data, calculating that if Musk died within the next year, approximately $1.4 billion could be transferred to Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do -- give it to my children?' and added, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' Thiel also expressed apocalyptic concerns, suggesting that a future 'Antichrist' figure could emerge by exploiting global crises like nuclear war, AI, or climate change to seize power and establish a one-world government. He even speculated whether Donald Trump could be that figure, saying, 'Do you think Trump is the Antichrist? I will give you a hearing. And we should consider that.' Thiel, a longtime supporter of Trump, was one of the first major Silicon Valley figures to back him politically. Musk, who became the first person in history to surpass a $500 billion net worth according to Forbes (though it has since dipped below that threshold), continues to make charitable donations through his Musk Foundation.

He argues that the U.S. has been 'humiliated' and 'ordered around' by a 'tiny' nation\u2014Israel, with only nine million people and no meaningful natural resources\u2014despite being the largest recipient of U.S. aid in history, with over $300 billion in aid over 80 years, including $30 billion since October 7, 2023. Carlson claims that Americans are 'marinating in lies' due to systemic censorship and intimidation, with dissenters labeled 'Nazis' or 'antisemites' to silence debate. He criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for interfering in U.S. politics, including pressuring Elon Musk to censor speech on X (Twitter), and for promoting the purchase of TikTok by Zionist billionaires to control American discourse. Carlson calls for restoring U.S. self-respect by ending dependency on Israel, banning dual citizenship, revoking citizenship for Americans fighting for foreign militaries (including in Israel and Ukraine), registering AIPAC under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), and rejecting Christian Zionism as heresy. He asserts that supporting Israel's actions in Gaza\u2014described as a 'massive displacement and killing of unarmed civilians'\u2014violates Christian doctrine, which prohibits the killing of the innocent.

Cote rejected the Department of Defense\u2019s claim that releasing Musk\u2019s security clearance details would invade his privacy, citing three specific X (formerly Twitter) posts: one from February 2024 stating he had held a top-secret clearance for years, a 2022 post claiming a single conversation with Vladimir Putin about space, and a January 2024 post confirming he agreed to three years of random drug testing at NASA\u2019s request. The judge noted these posts had collectively been viewed over 2 million times, with one reaching 24 million views, establishing that Musk\u2019s public statements outweighed any privacy interest. She ordered the Department of Defense to release the documents, though granted the Trump administration until October 17 to propose redactions. This ruling came amid other legal challenges, including a federal judge denying Musk\u2019s attempt to move an SEC lawsuit over his delayed disclosure of a five-percent stake in Twitter\u2014alleged to have enabled purchases of over $500 million in undervalued shares.

While his entrepreneurial achievements with Tesla and SpaceX are acknowledged as transformative and the result of intense effort and strategic planning, the article criticizes Musk for his controversial political affiliations, including public admiration for Donald Trump and perceived alignment with right-wing populist movements like the AfD.

The piece contends that Musk\u2019s rise is not a triumph of merit but a societal failure: a man with questionable character and conduct has amassed unprecedented power, and the public may ultimately bear the cost of his 'delusional visions.'

The suit was filed by U.S. citizen Jacqueline Macaverty on November\u202f5, 2024, claiming that Musk and his affiliated political action committee encouraged voters in swing states to sign a petition in exchange for a daily $1\u202fmillion prize, but that winners never received the money and personal data were collected. Judge Robert Beaton, appointed by former President Barack Obama, said Musk\u2019s language \u2018suggested a real chance to win money,\u2019 giving the case a solid legal basis. Musk defended the effort as a voluntary political campaign, noting clear warning signs, while the plaintiff argued the goal was to influence votes for former President Donald Trump. A Pennsylvania court had earlier ruled Musk\u2019s contests were not illegal, but the Philadelphia District Attorney announced plans to seek larger damages. Musk also announced plans to form a new \u2018America Party\u2019 to challenge the one\u2011party system, but later withdrew under pressure from Republican leaders, including Vice\u2011President J.D.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, invokes the Class Action Fairness Act and alleges that the total value of all class members\u2019 claims exceeds $5\u202fmillion. It seeks damages and injunctive relief on behalf of petition signers who say they were wrongly induced to provide personal identifying information when signing the petition. The complaint names Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty as lead plaintiff and alleges that America PAC and Musk induced voters in seven battleground states\u2014Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina\u2014to sign a petition supporting free speech and Second Amendment positions by promising $1\u202fmillion daily prizes chosen \u2018randomly\u2019 until Election Day. The suit says petition signers were required to provide names, addresses, emails and phone numbers and that the defendants benefited by driving traffic to X, Musk\u2019s social platform, and by collecting valuable political contact data. It also alleges that the lottery was not random, giving voters no real chance to collect. In November, Musk\u2019s lawyers told a Pennsylvania judge that winners were not chosen at random but were selected in advance\u2014contradicting Musk\u2019s own statements when he launched the contest. U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman ruled that McAferty plausibly alleged that she had been misled and that an expert could testify about the commercial value of battleground voters\u2019 contact information.

U.S. District Judge Robert\u202fPitman in Austin, Texas, ruled that McAferty\u2019s proposed class action against Musk and his political group, America\u202fPAC, is valid. McAferty also alleges that America\u202fPAC unlawfully collected her personal details during the giveaway in the final stretch of the 2024 election campaign.

Musk and America PAC's lawyers have not commented on the latest ruling. This case is 'McAferty v Musk,' US District Court for the Western District of Texas, case number 24-01346. A Philadelphia judge refused to stop Musk's lottery on the eve of the election, citing that the city's district attorney failed to prove it was an illegal lottery.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 06:41 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/8/21/n14577994.htm)\n\n**Elon Musk Must Face Lawsuit Over Alleged Voter Data Collection and Misleading Giveaway**\nBillionaire Elon Musk must face a lawsuit filed by voters who claim they were misled by him. According to the plaintiffs, this occurred during a daily giveaway of $1 million (approximately \u20ac850,000), organized by Musk in the run-up to the recent US presidential election. A judge ruled that the complaint makes it plausible that the winners of the disputed action were not chosen randomly, but by Musk's employees. Musk wanted the case to be dismissed, but the judge has allowed it to proceed. The plaintiffs claim that Musk and his political action committee America PAC collected voter data for Trump's presidential campaign through the action, which also aimed to drive traffic to Musk's platform X. Musk had promised to pay $1 million daily to someone who signed an online petition in support of the US Constitution. However, during a previous pre-trial hearing, Musk's lawyers confirmed that the selection was not random, while Musk publicly spoke about 'randomly' distributing the money. According to the judge, this could have given voters the impression that it was a real lottery. The action targeted voters in seven swing states crucial for Trump's re-election. Signers were required to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Through a collective claim, the voters are seeking at least $5 million in damages.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 04:36 AM\nSource:[Brabants Dagblad](https://www.bd.nl/buitenland/elon-musk-moet-zich-voor-de-rechter-verantwoorden-over-geldweggeefactie-rond-verkiezingen~a6d81bd6/)\n\n**Elon Musk Faces Lawsuit Over Sweepstakes-Style Giveaway During 2024 US Presidential Election**\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest man, has been sued over a sweepstakes-style giveaway that he ran during the 2024 US presidential election. US District Judge Robert Pitman has ruled that Musk must face the lawsuit. According to Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that Musk and his political action committee, America PAC, used the giveaway to encourage voters to sign a petition in support of the US Constitution and collect their personal information. The lawsuit claims that Musk and America PAC ran the giveaway in seven key swing states, promising to randomly select a winner each day who would receive a $1 million prize, 'like a lottery', but in reality, participants had 'almost no chance of actually winning'. The lawsuit also alleges that signers of the petition were required to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Musk had previously established America PAC to support Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. The organization was accused of using the prize promise to boost the number of petition signatures. Musk's lawyers had previously asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing 'obvious flaws' in the allegations, but Judge Pitman did not accept the motion and ruled that the lawsuit would continue. As of now, Musk's lawyers have not responded to media requests for comment. As the actual controller of Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk's public image is closely tied to his companies. This negative political news, which involves allegations of election fraud, may damage consumer trust in his brands and raise concerns among some investors and business partners. The case is ongoing.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 03:08 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8lziPLVxJjv)\n\n**Elon Musk Must Face Lawsuit Over Alleged Fraud in Giveaway**\nA US federal court has ruled that Elon Musk must face a lawsuit alleging fraud related to a giveaway. Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, sided with plaintiff Jacqueline McAferty, who claims Musk and his political action committee America PAC misled voters into providing personal data. Musk had founded America PAC to support Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. He announced in October that he would give away $1 million daily to those who signed a petition and were registered voters in one of seven key swing states. McAferty said Musk and America PAC lured voters into signing the petition by promising they could win $1 million, but the signers had no real chance of receiving the money. They were also required to provide names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. Musk had argued that the giveaway was not an illegal lottery, as the winners were chosen to 'earn' the money and were expected to serve as spokespeople for the committee. However, the judge rejected this argument, citing other statements from Musk that suggested the money was 'given' and 'won.' McAferty's lawyer said, 'It is plausible that the plaintiff relied on these statements.' Musk had also denied that the signers of the petition suffered any harm from providing their contact information. Pitman said an expert on political data brokerage could testify about the value of this information for voters in the contested states. The lawsuit was filed on election day, November 5, 2024.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 02:19 AM\nSource:[ZEIT ONLINE](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2025-08/elon-musk-betrugsvorwuerfe-usa-wahlkampf)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across seven expert forecasts utilizing diverse but overlapping legal, political, and historical frameworks, the consensus is that it is unlikely Elon Musk's million-dollar giveaway to register voters will be considered illegal by December 31, 2025. Forecasters universally note that, as of October 2025, no U.S. court or regulatory body has ruled the giveaway illegal, though ongoing federal lawsuits (notably a class action) have advanced past dismissal and judicial scrutiny of potential fraud, lottery, and regulatory violations has increased. Experts highlight several key factors suppressing the probability of a Yes outcome: the slow pace of the U.S. legal system, the likelihood of appeals or stays if an adverse ruling occurs, significant legal ambiguity (whether the giveaway constitutes bribery, an illegal lottery, or falls within protected civic/political activity), and the tradition of courts avoiding novel, precedent-setting rulings in cases with plausible First Amendment defenses or political overtones. While some elevate the probability slightly to account for the real but moderate legal risk created by advancing lawsuits and adverse preliminary judicial findings, base rates from similar cases and the strict resolution criteria\u2014requiring a final, not overturned ruling by year-end\u2014drive most forecasts to assign probabilities between 8% and 35%, centered below 25%. The strong majority view is that ongoing litigation or procedural developments (such as findings that permit cases to proceed or raise discovery) will not mature into a definitive, standing illegality ruling by the resolution date, though the possibility is not zero given the seriousness and unique facts of the case.",
