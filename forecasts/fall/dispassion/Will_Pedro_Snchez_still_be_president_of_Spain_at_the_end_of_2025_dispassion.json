A risk premium is warranted: coalition failure or a direct criminal charge could precipitate rapid change. Yet, barring revelations directly implicating S\u00e1nchez or a coalition mutiny, status quo bias and the procedural difficulty of unseating the PM favor survival. I adjust from a default status quo/high base rate (~93% at 12 months out) downward due to the scandal and coalition risk, but hold the overall probability relatively high given the opposition's inability to unite, lack of a single triggering new event, and persistent above-average institutional inertia.

Legislative deadlock is problematic but not unprecedented; rolling over budgets is common in Spanish politics, and acute crises typically need to get far worse before coalition partners risk unpredictable snap elections (where they could lose seats and leverage). According to base rates and coalition theory, most minority governments in Spain muddle through unless a broad and deeply motivated alliance can be assembled for both the fall and replacement of the PM; as of September, that scenario remains remote.

The explicit downward adjustment from the legal/institutional status quo\u2014justified by contemporary scandal pressure\u2014admirably reflects real-world policymaking dynamics, without falling prey to the recency bias that can plague political forecasting. It is especially strong in recognizing the lack of a ready alternative PM or a unifying scandal to galvanize a multi-partner opposition, and in highlighting the steepness of the procedural barrier: a constructive no-confidence vote. This approach keeps the central status quo outcome as the anchor, making the most likely scenario clear while acknowledging the real, but still subdominant, tail risks."

            "response": "This forecast cogently applies comparative parliamentary system logic, underscoring critical features: the constructive vote of no confidence and the splintered opposition make government survival the default. Its emphasis on Sumar and regionalists as rational actors with little to gain and much to lose in risky snap elections is empirically sound, as is the observation that institutional hurdles to cross-bloc coordination are nearly insurmountable absent a truly seismic event directly incriminating the PM. By situating the Spanish case among European counterparts and weighing scandal impact only when coupled with parliamentary viability, this reasoning avoids common forecasting pitfalls such as overreacting to scandal noise or misunderstanding the difference between public controversy and actual government removability. The probability (84%) finds a prudent sweet spot: high, acknowledging deep inertia, but not absolute, given non-trivial but unmaterialized risk. This discipline and historical contextualization reinforce the value of the approach."

From a legitimacy perspective, significant erosion of governing trust\u2014even without a 'smoking gun' against S\u00e1nchez\u2014can still accelerate inter-elite bargaining and partner brinkmanship, especially in a minority government dependent on volatile small parties. While Spanish institutional design makes rapid change unlikely, 88% does not sufficiently capture the history of governments destabilized by sustained legitimacy attrition, factional dissatisfaction, or unexpected elite defections in late-stage crises. This overweights procedural friction and underweights the dynamic, often non-linear, consequences of persistent, escalating legitimacy crises in parliamentary systems\u2014especially when combined with personal ties to the scandalized figures and familial suspicion. A probability in the mid-70s or low-80s more accurately reflects the non-trivial (though still minoritarian) risk of cascading regime legitimacy failure with three months left, especially if new revelations further erode trust or coalition endurance."

The forecaster accurately notes that the corruption scandal, while damaging, has not translated to an elite coalition willing to risk uncertain electoral fortunes; both coalition inertia and institutional design continue to favor muddling through. This forecast is especially strong by rooting its estimate in the precedent of Rajoy\u2019s 2018 ouster (an extraordinary event), suggesting that absent similarly damning revelations directly implicating S\u00e1nchez, the risk remains distinctly suppressed.

Critique of the lower (73%) probability for overestimating the effective political risk is well founded: legitimacy erosion and coalition malaise alone have rarely translated into successful removal within such a short time frame, especially absent new, smoking-gun evidence.

There is no suggestion among the expert group of an overlooked high-probability exit pathway. Consensus estimates are mostly in the 82\u201388% range, reinforcing the boldness of my initial estimate.

While I still factor in the above-average political risk due to scandal and coalition tension (thus not joining the 85%+ zone), the short window remaining, lack of new acute catalyst, and robust status quo bias mean the true probability is somewhat higher than my initial phase 1 estimate.

Several other perspectives\u2014from comparative parliamentary systems to political leadership stability\u2014echo these points and point out the rarity of mid-term PM removals in Spain. Only the Political Legitimacy (Sociology) forecast marks a substantially lower probability, but this view arguably over-weights reputational crisis relative to functional/institutional barriers.

Several strong forecasters echoed this institutional anchoring, and critiques of somewhat lower probabilities rightly highlighted that, without an acute trigger (direct evidence against S\u00e1nchez, mass defections, or elite party revolt), the inertia and procedural friction stay dominant. The only reasons to even slightly lower the probability would be the ongoing multi-vector corruption investigations and coalition restiveness, but none of the available political or parliamentary signals rise to the level of credible immediate collapse. On reflection, and considering that most peer forecasts cluster in the low- to mid-80s, I see no compelling reason for a sharp adjustment. If anything, the rigor with which lower-probability predictions were critiqued in deliberation supports maintaining or even nudging up my prediction.

While a few forecasters assign slightly lower probabilities due to ongoing legitimacy erosion and coalition tension, critiques convincingly note that those risks are overweighed relative to Spain's base rates and institutional friction.

In particular, the persistent absence of coalition withdrawal, the lack of escalated scandal implicating S\u00e1nchez directly, and the stagnation of the opposition all argue for a more status quo-favorable stance.

This will be the second Director Committee gathering since Montero\u2019s appointment, the first having taken place on 16 May 2025 in San Juan de Aznalfarache, where she announced the party\u2019s shift to an \u2018offensive and action\u2011oriented\u2019 stance to regain control of the Junta and drive a \u2018deep transformation\u2019 of Andalusia.

An investigation by the Civil Guard has implicated former Socialist Party Secretary of Organization Santos Cerd\u00e1n, a close ally of S\u00e1nchez, in a suspected bribery scheme. This has further damaged the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), which is already embroiled in a corruption scandal involving former Secretary of Organization and former Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos and his advisor Koldo Garc\u00eda. The scandal has now spread to the region of Navarra, which is governed by the Socialists, after a high-ranking local official resigned due to his ties with Cerd\u00e1n and alleged corrupt practices in public works contracts. The main opposition party, the conservative Popular Party (PP), believes that the scandal could bring down the government. Its leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, describes the PSOE as a party in a state of destruction and considers the situation to be a major crisis.

Meanwhile, the government remains committed to completing its term in 2027, with Vice President Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero stating that they have 'plenty of reasons' to continue and will continue to seek support to pass legislation. Montero has also acknowledged that the PSOE's apology for corruption is not enough and that more measures are needed to regain trust.

He challenged the opposition to present a motion of censure, rather than demanding early elections. The Prime Minister announced a series of measures in response to the resignation of Santos Cerd\u00e1n, the PSOE's secretary of Organization, who was accused of managing illegal commissions for his predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos. S\u00e1nchez emphasized that 'possible corruption by a few will have to be substantiated in the courts.' He also stated that the police report cited does not make any allegations about irregular financing of the PSOE. S\u00e1nchez dismissed the idea of presenting a confidence motion to check if the Parliament maintains its support for him to continue as head of government, and reaffirmed that he will not make any changes to the government, formed by a coalition of left-wing parties. 'The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party is a clean organization, clean,' S\u00e1nchez said. 'We will not cover up corruption that emerges in our ranks, no matter how painful it may be.' S\u00e1nchez called on the opposition to present a motion of censure and tell the Parliament and citizens what model of country they want for Spain. He also announced that he will meet with the groups that supported his investiture, starting with the vice president Yolanda D\u00edaz, to discuss their proposals.

S\u00e1nchez will appear in Congress to provide explanations and the socialist parliamentary group will propose a parliamentary commission of investigation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 17, 2025 06:10 AM\nSource:[Diario EL PAIS Uruguay](https://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/espana/sanchez-se-aferra-al-poder-y-no-dejara-el-gobierno)\n\n**Pedro S\u00e1nchez Challenges Opposition to Present Motion of Censure**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has responded to opposition demands for his resignation by challenging them to present a motion of censure. 'Present a motion of censure and tell the Parliament and citizens what model of country you want for Spain,' S\u00e1nchez said in a press conference, addressing the conservative Partido Popular and the far-right Vox party. S\u00e1nchez appeared before the press after a long meeting of his party to make changes following a police report pointing to the third-ranking member of the party, Santos Cerd\u00e1n, for taking bribes in exchange for public contracts. Cerd\u00e1n resigned as secretary of organization of the PSOE on Friday and as a deputy on Monday, while former minister and S\u00e1nchez's former right-hand man, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, was expelled from the party on Monday. S\u00e1nchez defended his party's swift response and again ruled out resigning or calling early elections. 'The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party is a clean organization,' S\u00e1nchez said. 'We won't cover up corruption that arises within our ranks, no matter how painful it is.' S\u00e1nchez and the socialists govern in minority with the support of various far-left and nationalist formations, with which he will meet to explain himself. The first of these meetings was on Monday with Yolanda D\u00edaz, leader of the far-left Sumar formation, who governs with the socialists, and third vice president, who demanded 'absolute cleanliness' of all PSOE members involved in the scandal. 'What has happened is very serious, it breaks trust,' she added. The spokesperson for the Partido Popular, Borja S\u00e9mper, appeared after S\u00e1nchez to demand his resignation and call for elections. 'We aspire to have him announce the dissolution of the Cortes and the call for elections. The only possible, dignified future is to give the word to the Spanish people,' S\u00e9mper said.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 17, 2025 04:19 AM\nSource:[Listin diario](https://listindiario.com/las-mundiales/20250617/pedro-sanchez-sugiere-mocion-censura_862248.html)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez Promises 'Contundency' Against Corruption, Challenges Opposition to Present Motion of Censure**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has promised 'contundency' against corruption and claimed that his party is 'clean'. He challenged the conservative and far-right opposition to present a motion of censure, rather than demanding early general elections. S\u00e1nchez appeared before the press at the Socialist Party (PSOE) headquarters to announce a series of measures following the resignation of all his party's positions held by Santos Cerd\u00e1n, who is suspected of managing illegal commissions for his predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, and a helper in the awarding of public works, according to a police judicial report. S\u00e1nchez insisted that 'possible corruption of a few will have to be substantiated in the courts', also referring to \u00c1balos, the former Socialist Organization Secretary and former Transport Minister, investigated by the Supreme Court since November 2024 and expelled definitively today from the PSOE. He also emphasized that the police report cited does not make any allegations about irregular financing of his party. S\u00e1nchez ruled out presenting a confidence motion to check if Parliament maintains its support for him to continue as head of government and reaffirmed that he will not make any changes to the government, formed by a coalition of left-wing parties and which he valued for its 'cleanliness'. He added that he will meet with parliamentary groups that supported him in 2023 to be re-elected as Prime Minister after the general elections in July of that year. Yolanda D\u00edaz, the second vice-president of the Executive and leader of the Sumar movement, considered S\u00e1nchez's explanations 'insufficient' and demanded measures of democratic regeneration and the absolute cleanliness of all corners of power and the PSOE that may have been involved in the alleged corruption scheme. 'It's not true, corruption is not inevitable. Enough of cynicism!', exclaimed the politician of Sumar. The Basque Nationalist Party, one of the parliamentary partners of the government, also demanded 'greater contundency and transparency'. S\u00e1nchez began to govern in mid-2018 precisely after winning a motion of censure against the then-conservative government, just after the Supreme Court condemned the PP for a corruption case. Among the PSOE measures in these circumstances, the Organization Secretary will have a provisional collegiate direction until the meeting of the Socialist Executive Direction on July 5, when S\u00e1nchez will propose who will succeed the resigned Santos Cerd\u00e1n. There will be a new external audit to review the party's accounts and the results will be published. S\u00e1nchez will appear in Congress to give 'all' the explanations and the Socialist parliamentary group will propose a parliamentary commission of investigation to know the truth of the case. In the opposition, the PP spokesperson, Borja S\u00e9mper, demanded an immediate parliamentary appearance by S\u00e1nchez and argued that a motion of censure would be a 'breath of fresh air' for S\u00e1nchez, in the belief that his parliamentary partners of the left and nationalists and independentists from the Basque Country and Catalonia would not let him fall. On the other hand, the leader of Vox (far-right), Santiago Abascal, offered the deputies of his party for a motion of censure with the aim of winning it and calling for immediate elections. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 11:43 PM\nSource:[El Nacional](https://www.elnacional.com/mundo/adelanta-las-elecciones-lo-que-dijo-pedro-sanchez-en-su-ultima-comparecencia-en-la-que-reto-a-la-oposicion/)\n\n**Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez Reiterates No Early Election Before 2027**\nDespite corruption allegations, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has reiterated that there will be no early election before 2027. Sanchez made the statement after a 4.5-hour meeting with his party's leaders following the resignation of two high-ranking officials due to corruption allegations. Sanchez stated, 'PSOE is a clean organization, and this is the only corruption case that has affected me since I became the leader.' He also announced that a parliamentary commission will be formed to investigate the corruption allegations. Sanchez rejected the calls for early election from the opposition parties, including the right-wing People's Party (PP) and the far-right Vox, and reiterated that the general election will be held in 2027 as scheduled. He also stated that the current minority coalition government will not seek a confidence vote in parliament or make any changes to the cabinet. Sanchez called on the opposition parties to use their democratic options and submit a no-confidence vote against the government. He also accused the PP of spreading lies and making false accusations against him and the PSOE, and stated that the truth will come out when the court decisions are made in the pending cases against the PP. Sanchez expressed his regret for trusting Abalos and Cerdan, who are accused of corruption, and apologized to the Spanish people. He emphasized that the corruption allegations should not overshadow the government's achievements.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 04:11 PM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/guncel/ispanya-basbakani-sanchez-erken-secim-olmayacagini-vurguladi-18753891-haberi/)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez Rejects Early Elections, Challenges Opposition to Motion of Censure**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has promised 'contundency' against corruption, stating that his party is 'clean' and challenging the conservative and far-right opposition to present a motion of censure instead of demanding early general elections.

Despite the pressure, S\u00e1nchez has refused to resign and is determined to continue leading the government until 2027. However, his position is becoming increasingly untenable, and his own party, the PSOE, is starting to turn against him. S\u00e1nchez's options for resolving the crisis are limited, and he is considering several alternatives, including calling a special congress to restructure the party, dissolving the Cortes and calling early elections, or using the 'question of confidence' mechanism to seek a vote of confidence from the Congress. However, these options are not without risks, and S\u00e1nchez's decision will have significant consequences for the country and his own party. Meanwhile, opposition parties are considering a motion of censure against S\u00e1nchez, but it is unlikely to succeed due to the lack of support from the necessary number of deputies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 05:51 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/edicion/20250616/callejon-sin-salida-vias-constitucionales-resolver-crisis-bloqueadas-sanchez-socios/1003743805678_16.html)\n\n**Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez Apologizes to Citizens Amid Corruption Scandal**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez apologized to the citizens, stating that they will not hold an election until 2027. This comes after the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) Secretary General Santos Cerdan resigned from his position and as a member of parliament due to corruption allegations. The allegations, which included a secretly recorded conversation between Cerdan and former Ula\u015ft\u0131rma Bakan\u0131 Jose Luis Abalos' advisor Koldo Garcia, revealed that Cerdan had asked Garcia to manipulate the 2014 PSOE general secretary election in Sanchez's favor. Sanchez stated that he had not believed the allegations until the UCO's report, and that he had asked Cerdan to resign. Sanchez also announced that the PSOE Federal Committee would be re-elected immediately. The opposition parties and the coalition government's small partner Sumar alliance have been pressuring Sanchez to resign and hold early elections. Sanchez stated that Spain needs stability and continuity, and that there will be no elections until 2027.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[Yeni \u00c7a\u011f Gazetesi](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/avrupa-ulkesini-sarsan-yolsuzluk-krizi-924971h.htm)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez Rules Out Elections Until 2027, Denies Government Crisis**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez stated on Thursday that 'there will be no general elections until 2027' and expressed his intention to run again in two years. S\u00e1nchez also dismissed the possibility of a motion of censure or a government crisis following the scandal surrounding Santos Cerd\u00e1n, who resigned as Secretary of Organization of the PSOE after being implicated in a report by the UCO of the Guardia Civil. S\u00e1nchez made these statements at a press conference at the PSOE federal headquarters, where he appeared after 5 pm to 'explain himself' after Cerd\u00e1n's resignation. S\u00e1nchez emphasized that the current government, formed by the PSOE and Sumar, is 'suffering a clear siege by the opposition on numerous issues unrelated to reality.' He added that the government's project 'is doing good things for our country in the areas of democratic regeneration, social transformation, and a necessary model of country.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 04:07 PM\nSource:[ABC \ufeffTU DIARIO EN ESPA\u00d1OL](https://www.abc.es/espana/elecciones-mocion-crisis-gobierno-sanchez-descarta-decision-20250612180716-nt.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014spanning political risk analysis, Spanish constitutional law, political science, European studies, and sociology\u2014a clear consensus emerges: Pedro S\u00e1nchez is likely to remain Prime Minister of Spain through the end of 2025, with most probabilities clustering between 78% and 88%. Experts agree that while the current corruption scandals involving his party and close associates have created significant instability and public/media pressure, multiple structural and institutional factors make an early exit by S\u00e1nchez unlikely within the short three-and-a-half month window remaining until December 31, 2025.\n\nThe primary reason for this high likelihood is the procedural and parliamentary hurdles required to remove a Spanish prime minister outside of scheduled elections. A successful motion of no confidence in Spain requires not just a parliamentary majority opposing the government, but also a unified majority agreeing on a single alternative candidate for prime minister\u2014a difficult feat given the current fragmentation and lack of trust among opposition, regionalist, and left-wing parties. The opposition, despite increased public agitation, currently lacks both the numbers and the consensus needed for such a motion, and coalition partners\u2014however uneasy\u2014are disinclined to risk early elections that could potentially empower their political adversaries.\n\nAll experts highlight the Spanish tradition and base rate of incumbency: prime ministers very rarely leave mid-term except under exceptional circumstances (as in Rajoy\u2019s fall in 2018, which involved a decisive corruption verdict and a clear alternative majority). S\u00e1nchez has publicly committed to serve out the term, commands continued (if strained) party discipline, and coalition partners continue to prioritize strategic self-preservation over regime change in the absence of a catastrophic development directly implicating S\u00e1nchez personally.\n\nNevertheless, experts assign non-trivial risk (generally below 20%) to scenarios where new, more direct corruption revelations could emerge\u2014undermining S\u00e1nchez\u2019s legitimacy, fracturing coalition discipline, and potentially enabling an unprecedented cross-bloc vote or forcing his resignation. Legislative gridlock, budget failures, or a sudden health or personal crisis are also flagged as plausible (but currently less probable) triggers, though the window for such events to transpire is narrowing.\n\nIn summary, the overwhelming expert consensus is that, barring a major unforeseen escalation in scandal or coalition defection, structural inertia, institutional barriers, and the complex arithmetic of Spanish parliamentary politics are likely to keep Pedro S\u00e1nchez in office through the end of 2025.",
