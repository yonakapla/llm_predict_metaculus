Political constraints in host nations, the risk of regional backlash, and China\u2019s preference for avoiding overt military signaling reinforce the status quo. The US intelligence community would likely publicize any clear evidence of a new PLA base, but strong evidence and a public announcement threshold have not been met and are unlikely to materialize in the remaining 13 months.

Host-nation sensitivities, especially in Pakistan (concerned about domestic backlash and regional pushback), further slow the transition from dual-use to declared military base. The US and allied intelligence communities are highly alert to such developments and would likely publicize any definitive evidence, but have not yet done so. With just over a year remaining, it is plausible that an abrupt escalation or diplomatic shift could prompt a formal announcement, especially if regional security deteriorates (e.g., maritime crisis, Indo-Pakistani tensions). However, the most likely scenario is continued incremental militarization without a public, high-confidence announcement meeting the question's criteria by the deadline.

Despite growing PLA ambitions and mounting evidence of military-ready port upgrades in Pakistan\u2014reinforced by the latest reporting on Gwadar\u2019s deepening dual-use role\u2014there is still no public, high-confidence declaration from Beijing or Washington that would satisfy the question\u2019s resolution criteria. The base rate for new Chinese overseas bases since Djibouti remains very low, and the timeline to January 2026 is short for both construction and the political process required for such an overt step. While the possibility of a sudden US intelligence announcement exists (especially if new imagery or signals intelligence emerges), the most likely scenario is continued ambiguity, with Chinese activities falling short of a formal, indefinite military base announcement. I therefore assess the probability that China will operate at least one military base in a BRICS country before 2026 at 17%, reflecting some risk of rapid escalation but heavily weighted toward the status quo and the history of Chinese strategic behavior.",

The key weakness in their reasoning is an overemphasis on the strategic logic for base expansion at the expense of the practical and political obstacles to a public, indefinite PLA basing announcement. The requirement for resolution is not simply the existence of a military-capable port or even PLA access, but a formal, public acknowledgment by China or the US intelligence community. The precedent set by Djibouti suggests that years of incremental buildup and overt signaling precede such announcements. There is no such ramp-up or public signaling in Pakistan or any BRICS country at present. Furthermore, the short time horizon (less than a month) sharply limits the window for a qualifying event to occur. Their forecast underweights the inertia of ambiguity and the strong incentives for all parties to avoid a public shift with high geopolitical costs, especially ahead of major events like the 2027 Taiwan timeline. Therefore, while the strategic logic is sound, the probability should be closer to historical base rates, and the risk of sudden public acknowledgment remains low."

Their forecast, which places some risk on a sudden intelligence disclosure but heavily weights the status quo, is consistent with both the evidentiary bar for question resolution and the behavior of relevant actors to date.

While China's soft power narrative and economic priorities are important, the logic of power projection\u2014especially given growing US containment and potential instability in Pakistan or Egypt\u2014can, in exceptional cases, push states toward rapid, even risky, escalation. The liberal argument somewhat overweights institutional inertia and underweights the possibility that shifting threat perceptions, or a sudden opportunity (such as a friendly regime's request for security guarantees), could trigger a public basing arrangement despite the current pattern.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAs of August 2023, China has only one military base overseas - a naval base in Djibouti, Africa. However, there are clear indications that they are interested in expanding their global power projection capabilities, and indeed some overseas naval bases are allegedly under construction in Asia and Africa.\n\nWith the adding of seven new member countries to BRICS, an alliance primarily focused on economic and diplomatic partnership, it is an important question regarding the standoff between East and West whether BRICS will take a more militaristic aspect as well. Overseas Chinese military bases would be a strong indication of this.\n\n[China may be planning overseas naval bases] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/27/china-building-overseas-naval-bases-across-asia-and-africa-say-analysts\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":18541,\"question_id\":18541}}`",

Key coastal nodes from Keti Bandar to Jiwani are designed as dual-use facilities, with Gwadar serving as the central command hub. According to The Diplomat (2024), these developments form a 'maritime necklace' where commercial and military functions overlap. Gwadar\u2019s deep-sea port, operated by China Overseas Ports Holding Company under a 40-year lease, hosts luxury zones and smart city infrastructure, aligning with China\u2019s civil-military fusion doctrine.

Precedents in Hambantota (Sri Lanka), Sihanoukville (Cambodia), and Djibouti demonstrate how Chinese-financed projects evolve into strategic footholds. Pakistan\u2019s external debt to China exceeds US $30 billion, with coastal projects increasing dependency. Chinese-funded surveillance systems by Huawei and Dahua Technologies raise cybersecurity concerns, with data potentially accessible to the Chinese state (CSIS, 2024). Environmental damage from dredging and reclamation threatens fragile ecosystems, fueling local resentment. Displacement of fishing communities and minimal compensation have led to 'alienated modernity,' where residents see development but not benefit. Military utility is evident: tourist infrastructure can host naval vessels, fiber-optic cables support secure communications, and airstrips can serve drones.

Under the proposal, Russia could deploy up to 300 soldiers, anchor four warships\u2014including nuclear-powered vessels\u2014and gain preferential access to Sudanese mining contracts, especially for gold. The base in Port Sudan would enable Russia to monitor maritime traffic toward the Suez Canal, through which approximately 12% of global trade passes. In return, Sudan would receive advanced Russian air defense systems and weapons at preferential prices to support its war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). However, a Sudanese official warned the deal could provoke tensions with the United States and the European Union. U.S. officials are concerned that such a base would expand Russia\u2019s naval presence and military operations in the Red Sea, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean. Moscow has sought permanent access to Port Sudan for five years, and Russian forces are already present in several African countries. Experts believe the agreement would be a major strategic gain for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, China has built ports across Africa and operates a naval base in Djibouti near the largest U.S. base on the continent, while the U.S. maintains military presence in Somalia. Russia\u2019s influence in Africa has declined since the dismantling of the Wagner Group and the death of its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin in 2023, making the Sudanese conflict a new opportunity. Initially, Russia supported the RSF to gain access to Sudan\u2019s gold, but later shifted allegiance to support the Sudanese government. In parallel, the Sudanese military has acquired drones from Iran, Egypt, and Turkey. Analysts suggest the military\u2019s push to finalize the deal reflects the deteriorating state of its military position: despite controlling Khartoum, the RSF has fully seized Darfur, with reports of new massacres against civilians. The war has killed around 150,000 people and displaced 12 million, constituting one of Africa\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[euronews](http://arabic.euronews.com/2025/12/01/hundreds-of-soldiers-and-nuclear-ships-what-are-the-details-of-the-sudanese-offer-to)\n\n**WSJ Reports Sudan Offered Russia Military Base on Red Sea**\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, Sudan has reportedly offered Russia the establishment of a naval base on the Red Sea. The proposed deal, presented in October 2025, would last 25 years and, if realized, would grant Moscow the right to deploy up to 300 military personnel and up to four ships in Port Sudan or another location along the Red Sea. The Journal stated that such a move would represent a strategic advantage for Moscow and would be a 'troubling event' for the United States, which seeks to prevent Russian and Chinese control over African ports. Additionally, Sudan's Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Djibril Ibrahim, previously expressed the country's interest in joining BRICS.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 08:55 PM\nSource:[RT \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c](https://russian.rt.com/world/news/1566351-sudan-rossiya-voennaya-baza)\n\n**Moving Forward Toward a New Era: Strengthening Both Wings of the Belt and Road Initiative**\nThe article, published on December 1, 2025, by China Military Online, uses the metaphor of a 'great peng bird' with two wings to illustrate the strategic vision of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), emphasizing the importance of balanced development in both land and maritime dimensions. Since its launch in 2013, the BRI has expanded to include over 150 countries and 30 international organizations, guided by the principles of 'joint consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits.' The initiative has evolved into one of the world's most popular international public goods and the largest cooperation platform. The article highlights the 'land-sea dual wings' model, exemplified by the Western Land-Sea New Channel, which has transformed inland cities like Chongqing into global logistics hubs, connecting East, West, South, and North. By October 2025, the Western Land-Sea New Channel reached 581 ports across 127 countries. The article also underscores the strategic importance of ports, citing developments such as the new Yiwu (Suxi) International Hub Port in Ningbo-Zhoushan, which became operational on June 27, 2025, and the expansion of smart port technologies in cities like Rizhao and Beihai. As of 2025, China has 311 open ports, with the 'Silk Road Maritime' network reaching 150 ports in 48 countries, handling 24 million TEUs in the first eight months. The 20th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session endorsed the '15th Five-Year Plan' proposal, calling for high-quality BRI development, marine economic growth, and the construction of a maritime power, reinforcing the strategy of land-sea integration and dual-wing advancement. President Xi Jinping emphasized in April 2024 that 'both wings must be strong' for China to achieve high-level opening-up, a vision now being realized through coordinated infrastructure, logistics, and international cooperation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[81.cn](http://www.81.cn/xx_207779/16424724.html)\n\n**Despite China's Military Modernization and Expansion, the PLA Still Has Significant Weaknesses | The Gateway Pundit | by Antonio Graceffo**\nDespite significant advancements in military modernization, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) faces critical weaknesses that hinder its ability to achieve global military parity with the United States. These include limited global power projection due to a lack of overseas bases\u2014only a single base in Djibouti exists\u2014making sustained operations beyond China\u2019s immediate periphery impractical. China\u2019s nuclear arsenal, while expanding from approximately 600 warheads in 2025 to an expected 1,000 by 2030, remains smaller and less mature than the U.S. arsenal of about 5,177 warheads, with less geographic distribution, untested systems, and a centralized, vulnerable command structure. The PLA lacks reliable allies: its only formal mutual-defense treaty is with North Korea, and its partnerships with Russia, Iran, and Pakistan lack binding commitments. Joint exercises with Russia and Pakistan have not resulted in true interoperability, with no evidence of integrated command structures, shared communications, or combat experience. In contrast, the U.S. and its allies benefit from decades of joint operations, standardized systems, English as a common operational language, and extensive combat experience across multiple conflicts since World War I. The PLA has not engaged in a major war since the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, leaving an entire generation of officers without real combat experience. Organizational challenges persist, including poor interservice integration and difficulties integrating advanced technologies like hypersonic weapons and AI into a cohesive, real-time command-and-control system. Additionally, China faces intense political pressure to meet ambitious timelines\u20142027 for initial capability, 2035 for full modernization, and 2049 for 'world-class' status\u2014which may lead to premature deployment of underdeveloped systems. While China has made remarkable progress in individual capabilities, the integration of these systems into a combat-tested, globally deployable force remains unproven. The U.S. retains enduring advantages in power projection, nuclear readiness, joint operations, and alliance cohesion. However, the gap is expected to narrow over time due to China\u2019s methodical modernization strategy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 02:09 PM\nSource:[The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2025/11/despite-chinas-military-modernization-expansion-pla-still-has/)\n\n**Beaches or Bases?**\nChina's coastal investments in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) are framed as tourism and leisure development\u2014featuring beach resorts, marinas, and eco-villages\u2014but serve strategic military and logistical purposes.

The 25-page proposal, directed to Russian officials, suggests stationing up to 300 Russian military personnel and up to four warships in Port Sudan or another location in the Red Sea. The base would occupy an 'unprecedented position with a view of critical Red Sea trade routes,' according to the report. Russia would also be granted access to lucrative mining concessions in Sudan, the third-largest gold producer in Africa. The WSJ notes that such an agreement would be a 'strategic advantage for Moscow' and a 'cause for concern for the U.S.', which seeks to prevent Russian and Chinese control over African ports. A unnamed Sudanese military official told the Journal that Sudan needs new arms supplies. The article also references an American official stating that a Russian base in Libya or Port Sudan could expand Russia\u2019s power projection capabilities. Former U.S. Air Force brigadier general Mark Hicks, who commanded special operations units in Africa, said the deal would strengthen Russia\u2019s international prestige and influence. Russia and Sudan had previously agreed in 2020 to sign a bilateral agreement allowing Russia to establish a material-technical support point for its Navy in Sudan. Talks had stalled after the 2019 coup but were reported to have resumed, with Sudan\u2019s Foreign Minister Ali Yousef Sharif stating in February 2025 that mutual understanding had been reached. However, in November 2025, Russian ambassador to Sudan Andrey Chernovol stated that due to the ongoing conflict in Sudan, progress on the issue has been 'suspended'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/01/12/2025/692dc5799a79476f3477fcca)\n\n**Russia to Establish First African Naval Base on Red Sea Coast in Sudan**\nSudan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Yousef Ahmed al-Sharif, confirmed that Russia will establish its first naval base in Africa on the Red Sea coast, joining the United States and China, which already have bases in Djibouti. According to al-Sharif, who made the announcement during a visit to Moscow after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Sudan and Russia have reached 'full agreement' on the project, with no obstacles remaining. The agreement was initially signed in 2021, and both countries now only need to ratify the document. The Red Sea is a strategically critical waterway, connecting the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and carrying approximately 12% of global trade. Sudan first proposed the idea to Russia in 2017 during a visit by then-President Omar al-Bashir to Sochi. Al-Bashir was overthrown in a coup in 2019. A 2020 agreement allowed Russia to station up to four military vessels, including nuclear-powered ones, in Sudan for 25 years, with the base designated for logistical purposes, having a 'defensive character' and not directed against other countries. Western analysts note that establishing a naval base in Sudan would represent a significant strategic gain for Moscow, which has struggled to strengthen its presence on the African continent. For the United States, this development is a cause for concern, as Washington seeks to prevent Russia and China from gaining control over African ports where they could rearm and repair warships, potentially threatening vital maritime trade routes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 05:59 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/news/rossija-prihodit-v-sudan-na-poberezhe-krasnogo-morja-budet-sozdana-voenno-morskaja-baza_1462488)\n\n**[World View] The 2025 Reconfiguration of Global Power Blocs: A New Chessboard**\nThe global order in 2025 is undergoing dynamic transformation, marked by the reconfiguration of power blocs. Traditional Western alliances such as the G7, NATO, and G20 face growing challenges from emerging coalitions like BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and regional African and Arab unions. These new blocs are reshaping global governance, creating a complex, overlapping chessboard of competition and cooperation. The G20, despite its broad representation and economic influence\u2014accounting for a significant share of global GDP and trade\u2014faces weakened coordination amid geopolitical fractures, including U.S.-China rivalry, the war in Ukraine, and fiscal constraints highlighted in an IMF-G20 report. The G7 has evolved from a purely economic forum into a political platform, emphasizing democratic norms, technological resilience, and security. At the 51st G7 Summit in Canada (June 16\u201317, 2024), leaders reaffirmed support for Ukraine, launched a 'Critical Minerals Action Plan' to reduce dependence on China, and committed to countering foreign interference, cyberattacks, and disinformation. A landmark achievement was the $50 billion Special Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loan, funded by frozen Russian assets, signaling strategic intent to sustain Ukraine\u2019s defense. However, G7\u2019s limited membership and exclusion of Global South voices raise concerns about its declining influence. NATO remains central to transatlantic security, with its role expanding beyond Europe to include strategic coordination with Indo-Pacific partners amid growing concerns over China\u2019s military and economic reach. In 2024\u20132025, BRICS expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia, broadening its geographic and strategic reach. The 17th BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro (July 2025) addressed global health, infrastructure finance, climate, AI governance, and security reform. While BRICS members jointly criticized Western hegemony, they avoided firm commitments on a common currency or alternative reserve system. Internal divisions, including the absence of key leaders like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, have fueled doubts about cohesion. Nonetheless, BRICS is emerging as a core platform for the Global South, testing alternative governance models that challenge Western-dominated institutions.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 02:20 AM\nSource:[\ucc9c\uc9c0\uc77c\ubcf4 - \uc0c8 \uc2dc\ub300 \ud76c\ub9dd\uc5b8\ub860](https://www.newscj.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=3346413)\n\n**Moving Forward Toward a New Era: Strengthening Both Wings of the Belt and Road Initiative**\nThe article, published on December 1, 2025, by China Military Online, uses the metaphor of a 'great peng bird' with two wings to illustrate the strategic vision of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), emphasizing the importance of balanced development in both land and maritime dimensions. Since its launch in 2013, the BRI has expanded to include over 150 countries and 30 international organizations, guided by the principles of 'joint consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits.' The initiative has evolved into one of the world's most popular international public goods and the largest cooperation platform. The article highlights the 'land-sea dual wings' model, exemplified by the Western Land-Sea New Channel, which has transformed inland cities like Chongqing into global logistics hubs, connecting East, West, South, and North. By October 2025, the Western Land-Sea New Channel reached 581 ports across 127 countries. The article also underscores the strategic importance of ports, citing developments such as the new Yiwu (Suxi) International Hub Port in Ningbo-Zhoushan, which became operational on June 27, 2025, and the expansion of smart port technologies in cities like Rizhao and Beihai. As of 2025, China has 311 open ports, with the 'Silk Road Maritime' network reaching 150 ports in 48 countries, handling 24 million TEUs in the first eight months. The 20th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session endorsed the '15th Five-Year Plan' proposal, calling for high-quality BRI development, marine economic growth, and the construction of a maritime power, reinforcing the strategy of land-sea integration and dual-wing advancement. President Xi Jinping emphasized in April 2024 that 'both wings must be strong' for China to achieve high-level opening-up, a vision now being realized through coordinated infrastructure, logistics, and international cooperation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[81.cn](http://www.81.cn/xx_207779/16424724.html)\n\n**Satellite Imagery Reveals Five Major Chinese Coastal Military Bases Amid Escalating Cross-Strait Tensions**\nAccording to a report by Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council released on November 26, 2025, China is accelerating military preparations with the goal of achieving 'military unification of Taiwan by 2027.' The report, based on satellite imagery, identifies five major coastal military construction sites along China's eastern seaboard. The first is the Shanghai Pudong Naval Base, where new underground fuel storage tanks, railway spurs, and an amphibious base have been built; in May 2025, over 10 amphibious vessels, including one Type 075 amphibious assault ship, were docked\u2014capable of transporting approximately 5,000 troops. The second site is Yueqing Bay in Zhejiang, where a large new dock is under construction to support naval operations. The third is Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which has added a water runway to expand air operations and serve as a wartime forward refueling and logistics hub. The fourth is Xiamen Dadian Island Xiang'an International Airport, located just 3.7 kilometers from Kinmen, with nearly doubled reclamation area and integrated rail and road networks, enabling rapid military conversion. The fifth is the Zhangpu Helicopter Base, which has added new helicopter aprons and maintenance hangars, interpreted as a strategic forward base for potential operations targeting the Penghu Islands and a stepping stone for a landing on Taiwan's main island. The report frames these developments as part of a broader effort to enhance military deterrence against Taiwan.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 05:27 PM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2025/11/30/a104042881.html)\n\n**Despite China's Military Modernization and Expansion, the PLA Still Has Significant Weaknesses | The Gateway Pundit | by Antonio Graceffo**\nDespite significant advancements in military modernization, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) faces critical weaknesses that hinder its ability to achieve global military parity with the United States. These include limited global power projection due to a lack of overseas bases\u2014only a single base in Djibouti exists\u2014making sustained operations beyond China\u2019s immediate periphery impractical. China\u2019s nuclear arsenal, while expanding from approximately 600 warheads in 2025 to an expected 1,000 by 2030, remains smaller and less mature than the U.S. arsenal of about 5,177 warheads, with less geographic distribution, untested systems, and a centralized, vulnerable command structure. The PLA lacks reliable allies: its only formal mutual-defense treaty is with North Korea, and its partnerships with Russia, Iran, and Pakistan lack binding commitments. Joint exercises with Russia and Pakistan have not resulted in true interoperability, with no evidence of integrated command structures, shared communications, or combat experience. In contrast, the U.S. and its allies benefit from decades of joint operations, standardized systems, English as a common operational language, and extensive combat experience across multiple conflicts since World War I. The PLA has not engaged in a major war since the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, leaving an entire generation of officers without real combat experience. Organizational challenges persist, including poor interservice integration and difficulties integrating advanced technologies like hypersonic weapons and AI into a cohesive, real-time command-and-control system. Additionally, China faces intense political pressure to meet ambitious timelines\u20142027 for initial capability, 2035 for full modernization, and 2049 for 'world-class' status\u2014which may lead to premature deployment of underdeveloped systems. While China has made remarkable progress in individual capabilities, the integration of these systems into a combat-tested, globally deployable force remains unproven. The U.S. retains enduring advantages in power projection, nuclear readiness, joint operations, and alliance cohesion. However, the gap is expected to narrow over time due to China\u2019s methodical modernization strategy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 02:09 PM\nSource:[The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2025/11/despite-chinas-military-modernization-expansion-pla-still-has/)\n\n**Beijing's Blueprint: Pakistan as the Test Case for Africa**\nChina is shifting its Indian Ocean strategy from direct military basing to using proxies to secure strategic interests, with Pakistan serving as a key intermediary. This approach avoids the diplomatic backlash associated with overt bases like the PLA facility in Djibouti or the Hambantota Port lease in Sri Lanka. Pakistan, a core partner in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), has received advanced naval equipment from China, including Type 054A/P frigates and Hangor-class submarines, enhancing its maritime capabilities. In 2025, Pakistan assumed command of the multinational Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151), gaining operational presence in the Gulf of Aden and Somali coast\u2014regions critical to China\u2019s sea-lane security. In August 2025, Somalia signed a defence cooperation agreement with Pakistan, allowing it to train Somali officers, maintain naval vessels, and establish new units, with a joint committee to oversee implementation. This arrangement bypasses African Union and UN frameworks, creating a bilateral track that enhances Chinese influence without a direct PLA presence. Turkey also maintains a significant footprint in Somalia, including a 10-year maritime security pact with revenue-sharing. The proliferation of such bilateral defence partnerships risks weakening regional coordination, concentrating influence, and fostering dependency under the guise of capacity building. The Somalia-Pakistan agreement exemplifies China\u2019s new model of strategic subcontracting\u2014expanding reach while avoiding accountability. For Africa, the challenge lies in preserving sovereignty amid growing external influence, as the pattern mirrors past infrastructure dependencies seen in Djibouti and Hambantota. The article concludes that Pakistan\u2019s role in Somalia is not merely a bilateral deal but a blueprint for China\u2019s proxy power projection across the African littorals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 11:15 PM\nSource:[The Sunday Guardian Live](https://sundayguardianlive.com/news/top-5/beijings-blueprint-pakistan-as-the-test-case-for-africa-155648/)\n\n**Xi Jinping's China: A Defense Strategy (and 4)**\nChina has accelerated its defensive and international cooperation strategy in response to a military and geopolitical encirclement by the United States and its allies, according to a recent article from Acento. The piece argues that China, which became an economic powerhouse without a military superpower, now faces the risk of US military action after failed trade and technology wars. It cites US military agreements with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, Australia, and other neighboring countries, as well as AUKUS and the QUAD, as attempts to contain China. The article claims China has no military bases abroad except one in Africa and no formal military alliances with Russia, India, Iran, or Pakistan, preferring instead to maintain friendly relations. It highlights China\u2019s emphasis on building land corridors\u2014roads, railways, pipelines\u2014to bypass maritime choke points such as the Strait of Malacca, Suez, Gibraltar, and Panama. The author also notes China\u2019s support for multilateral groups like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and its Global Development Initiative aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals. The piece concludes that China\u2019s strategy is to create a vast terrestrial communication network across Eurasia, countering US naval dominance, while also projecting power through displays such as the recent 80\u2011year\u2011anniversary parade. The article\u2019s tone is strongly pro\u2011China, framing US actions as aggressive and portraying China as a peaceful, cooperative partner. Notable quotes include: 'mientras a China le preocupa tener pocos amigos, a EUA le preocupa tener pocos enemigos' and 'Te lo dije, pues, conociendo los peligros a que te enfrentas, \u00bfc\u00f3mo vas a permitir que tus dirigentes est\u00e9n conectados en WhatsApp, Waze o los sistemas de geolocalizaci\u00f3n de Google?'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 04:31 AM\nSource:[Acento](https://acento.com.do/opinion/la-china-de-xi-jinping-y-4-9557182.html)\n\n**China's little known \u00a3450 million military base that sits on the Suez Canal**\nChina reportedly spent about \u00a3450\u202fmillion to build its first overseas military base in Djibouti, a strategically located facility on the Horn of Africa that has been under construction since 2016 and is believed to be fully operational since 2022, supporting Chinese warships in the Indian Ocean. The base is part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s 2050 modernization plan, which could make it the world\u2019s largest military command centre. Beijing is also reportedly seeking a foothold in the Atlantic as Russia builds a blockade near Alaska, and China has begun buying advanced weapons from Russia, a move experts say signals an intention to invade Taiwan by 2027. U.S. officials say Xi ordered the army to prepare for a full\u2011scale invasion by 2027, and the Pentagon has asked defense contractors to double or quadruple weapons production to replenish stockpiles after years of supplying arms to conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, potentially exposing the U.S. to future risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 08:26 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2114977/china-suez-canal-military-base)\n\n**Understanding APEC: Towards a Multipolar World | Countercurrents**\nThis third article in a series on APEC examines the global shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world order. The article argues that while Donald Trump\u2019s tariff wars reflect U.S. economic power, they also signal a strategic retreat from global hegemony toward entrenched regional interests, acknowledging the rise of multipolarity. The 2008 financial crisis exposed the limitations of the Global North, prompting the Global South to develop alternative economic governance through initiatives like South-South cooperation. The expansion of BRICS to BRICS+ in 2023\u2014adding Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, and others\u2014significantly increased its economic and energy influence, enhancing its role as a counterbalance to Western institutions. Parallel financial and economic systems are emerging, challenging U.S.-led structures. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has deepened economic ties with Russia, reinforcing economic realignments. The article identifies three stages of U.S. military power decline: the 1979 reform and opening of China, the rise of U.S. financial hegemony, and the expansion of the AIIB\u2019s infrastructure financing. The article also notes that Joe Biden\u2019s emphasis on the U.S. as the 'most important ally' in the Middle East and its stance against Iran reflects deep strategic entanglement with China. The article concludes with a reference to a $1.5 trillion RMB forward basing capability within a day, suggesting a shift in financial and strategic power dynamics.

The PLA\u2019s \u2018support base\u2019 houses mechanised infantry, combat vehicles, helicopters and unmanned aerial systems, signalling a shift from logistics to power projection. Beijing is now pursuing facilities in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri\u202fLanka, the UAE, Kenya, Equatorial\u202fGuinea, Tanzania, Namibia and the Solomon Islands; the Ream Naval Base in Cambodia already provides rotational deployment capability. The Belt and Road Initiative has given China access to 94 ports worldwide as of 2020, creating \u2018dual\u2011use installations\u2019 that can support military operations. Project\u202f141, announced by Beijing, aims to establish at least five overseas bases and ten logistical support sites by 2030, a strategy that the Indian government describes as an \u2018encirclement\u2019 through the \u2018string of pearls\u2019 network.\n\nWhile China projects power abroad, it simultaneously suppresses dissent at home. Since 2017, authorities have detained between 800,000 and 2\u202fmillion Uyghurs in so\u2011called \u2018vocational education and training centres,\u2019 which analysts describe as the largest arbitrary detention of an ethnic minority since World War\u202fII. Detainees reportedly endure torture, forced labour, sexual abuse, forced sterilisation and coercive abortions, and are subjected to systematic de\u2011humanisation and forced renunciation of religious beliefs. In Hong\u202fKong, the 2020 National Security Law has criminalised political opposition; in November\u202f2024, 45 democracy advocates received prison sentences of up to ten years for organising primary elections.\n\nChina claims its overseas bases protect its investments and citizens, yet the regime\u2019s domestic surveillance and coercion undermine trust in its own people. The article argues that China\u2019s external assertiveness is inseparable from its internal repression, warning that a state that brutalises its own citizens is unlikely to respect the sovereignty of others. For India, the expanding naval presence and partnership with Pakistan pose a direct threat, prompting deeper alignment with the Quad and the US\u2011India COMPACT to counterbalance China\u2019s influence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 10:24 AM\nSource:[TFIPOST](https://tfipost.com/2025/09/chinas-military-reach-rises-on-the-backs-of-its-silenced-citizens/)\n\n**Chinafrique: A Strategic Cooperation Analysis**\nThe article examines China\u2019s expanding strategic and military cooperation with Africa, tracing its roots from the 1950s to the present. It highlights that China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative has driven a trade volume of 295\u202fbillion\u202fUSD in 2024, with Africa accounting for less than 5\u202f% of China\u2019s exports and receiving 80\u202f% of infrastructure projects in some countries. China\u2019s policy is framed around non\u2011intervention, South\u2011South cooperation, and the \u2018One China\u2019 principle, and it is supported by a network of 130 African political parties and the Forum on China\u2013Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). The article cites Chinese officials: \u2018La Chine, en tant que grand pays responsable, promeut activement la r\u00e9forme de la gouvernance mondiale\u2026\u2019 (Xi Jinping, 31\u202fDec\u202f2024) and \u2018Nous nous efforcerons de faire progresser l\u2019action de partenariat pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 commune et fournirons 1\u202fbillion\u202fyuan de subventions sous forme d\u2019assistance militaire \u00e0 l\u2019Afrique\u2019 (Wang\u202fYi, 2025).

The piece notes that Chinese security firms, numbering about 20 in Africa, are largely state\u2011aligned and focus on protecting Chinese interests rather than engaging in combat.

It notes that China conducts 95% of its international trade by sea and has leveraged this maritime dominance to create a network of strategic ports and bases. The U.S. maintains over 128 overseas bases in 51 countries with 170,000 personnel at an annual cost of $30\u201150\u202fbillion, whereas China\u2019s approach uses commercial ports to gain strategic leverage, as illustrated by its first overseas military base at Djibouti\u2019s Doraleh port (established 2017) and the Ream Naval Base in Cambodia, where Chinese vessels have been observed docked for extended periods. The article cites the Belt and Road Initiative (launched 2013) and the Twenty\u2011First Century Maritime Silk Road as the foundation for China\u2019s overseas port investments, noting that by September\u202f2023 China had signed 70 bilateral and regional shipping agreements with 66 countries and regions, and that Shanghai has remained the world\u2019s busiest container port for 13 consecutive years. It also highlights the economic\u2011debt dimension, reporting that AidData found at least $385\u202fbillion in hidden Chinese debt across 88 countries, with several nations like Zambia and Sri\u202fLanka already defaulting. The piece argues that China\u2019s dual\u2011use strategy allows it to avoid the political complications of formal military bases while creating long\u2011term dependencies, but it faces challenges from Western scrutiny, debt sustainability crises, and the lack of formal alliances. The article concludes that China could establish a network of overseas bases by the end of the decade, potentially challenging U.S. global dominance, but that success will hinge on managing host\u2011nation relationships and debt sustainability.

In 2015 and 2019, Chinese defense white papers declared the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy must \u2018secure energy routes and protect China\u2019s overseas interests,\u2019 a goal that led to the 2017 opening of the first overseas military base in Djibouti, capable of housing 2,000 troops and large naval vessels.  China\u2019s energy imports are heavily maritime: the International Energy Agency reports 11.3\u202fmillion barrels of oil per day in 2023, 72\u202f% arriving by sea, and more than 60\u202f% of those tankers transiting the Malacca Strait, which handles about a quarter of global trade and 40\u202f% of Europe\u2011bound oil.  To mitigate the choke\u2011point risk, China has built or upgraded 62 ports worldwide by 2020, including the 67\u202f%\u2011owned Piraeus in Greece, and has invested over $20\u202fbillion in African maritime infrastructure between 2010 and 2024.  The article cites the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, a $1.4\u202fbillion project financed by Chinese loans that forced the country to lease the port to a Chinese company for 99\u202fyears, as a textbook example of \u2018debt\u2011trap diplomacy.\u2019  It also notes the dual\u2011use nature of these facilities: commercial terminals such as Ream in Cambodia now host dry docks and berths capable of accommodating PLA Navy destroyers, while satellite imagery in 2022 revealed a Chinese nuclear submarine docking near Hambantota.  China\u2019s strategy is framed as a \u2018Malacca Dilemma\u2019\u2014the narrow strait is a single point of failure that Beijing seeks to hedge by developing alternative routes through the China\u2011Pakistan Economic Corridor, the China\u2011Myanmar Economic Corridor, and potential Arctic shipping lanes.  The piece concludes that the success or failure of this maritime push will reshape the strategic balance in the Indo\u2011Pacific, prompting counter\u2011measures such as the QUAD, AUKUS, and the G7\u2019s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 08:45 PM\nSource:[trend.az](https://www.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/4082858.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across the expert community, there is a near-consensus that China is highly unlikely to be publicly acknowledged as operating a military base in a BRICS country before January 1, 2026. Experts from diverse perspectives (military strategy, diplomacy, international law, security studies, and China area studies) emphasize that although China has built substantial dual-use infrastructure\u2014especially in Pakistan's Gwadar port and across CPEC\u2014these assets remain officially civilian or ambiguous in use. The conversion to an overt, indefinitely operated PLA base, and the corresponding public announcement by China or a high-confidence intelligence declaration by the US, is considered highly improbable within the short time left (approximately one month). Several constraining factors recur in the experts' analyses: China's historical preference for deniable, dual-use arrangements to avoid diplomatic backlash; host nation sensitivities\u2014especially Pakistan's need to avoid inflaming domestic or regional opposition; the high evidentiary and publicity threshold for qualifying announcements; and the very slow historical base rate for formal Chinese overseas military bases (only one, in Djibouti, since 2017). While incentives for PLA expansion and increased circumstantial evidence of military readiness at Gwadar and other locations are acknowledged, these are outweighed by China's risk aversion and the absence of any recent news signaling imminent public acknowledgment. Scenarios for a YES mostly require a crisis or intelligence leak that compels public confirmation, but these are seen as tail risks. The pooled expert probabilities center in the high single digits to low double digits (typically 7\u201320%), with most clustering around 8\u201318%. Thus, the expert consensus is that, barring a sudden and unforeseen crisis, the status quo will persist and the answer will almost certainly be NO.",
