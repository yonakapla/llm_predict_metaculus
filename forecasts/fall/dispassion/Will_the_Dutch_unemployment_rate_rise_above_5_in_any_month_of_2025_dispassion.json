Even without a dramatic GDP contraction, persistent labor supply increases and a stagnating or mildly contracting demand could produce sharper headline rate increases than a purely output-driven framework would anticipate.

It states that the 2024 budget deficit could fall below the critical 3\u202f% of GDP threshold, but this is attributed to a 17\u202f% cumulative inflation rate from 2022\u20112024, which forced workers and pensioners to pay an additional 25\u202fbillion euros in taxes.

Poverty is highlighted, with 5.7\u202fmillion Italians (almost 10\u202f% of the population) living at the brink of survival, largely among \"working\u2011poor\" who cannot meet basic needs.  Industrial production fell 8.5\u202f% from mid\u20112022 to end\u20112024, blamed on U.S. tariffs and Russian sanctions that raise energy costs.

The report also finds that in 2025 the average unemployment rate for 23\u2011 to 27\u2011year\u2011olds was 4.59\u202f%, a rise of 1.34\u202fpercentage points from 2019. Among non\u2011degree holders the rate increased by 0.47\u202fpercentage points, while for older university graduates it rose by 0.38\u202fpercentage points. In the tech sector unemployment climbed from 1.98\u202f% in 2019 to 3.02\u202f% in 2025, and the largest gains were seen in arts, design, sports and media, where the rate jumped 1.77\u202fpercentage points. The article notes that half of all ChatGPT messages are sent by users aged 18\u201125, and that a pilot study found a conversational\u2011assistant in customer\u2011support raised productivity by nearly 15\u202f% on average, especially for less\u2011experienced staff. It also cites the Indeed index, which was down 36\u202f% in July\u202f2025 versus the start of 2020, and a decline in Generation\u202fZ\u2019s professional\u2011conscience score from 36 to 33 between 2015\u20112017 and 2023\u20112025.

The piece concludes that the statistical gap for 22\u2011 to 27\u2011year\u2011olds in highly AI\u2011exposed jobs is not universal or definitive, but it will likely accelerate changes in higher\u2011education curricula toward AI\u2011audit, quality\u2011control and critical\u2011thinking skills.

The trend has been stable: 4.2% in April and May, 4.1% in June, 4.2% in July, and 4.3% in August. He states, 'no estamos ante un deterioro s\u00fabito, sino ante un enfriamiento ordenado del mercado laboral.' Job vacancies (JOLTS) fell to 7.18\u202fmillion in July\u202f2025, the lowest since September\u202f2024, which should ease future wage pressures. Unemployment claims rose in September but fell back to 218,000. The Fed\u2019s September\u202f2025 SEP projects a median unemployment of 4.5% this year, converging to 4.1% long\u2011term, indicating confidence in a gradual adjustment. The analyst projects unemployment between 4.4\u20134.6% in the coming quarters; if it rises >0.5\u202fpercentage point above the recent low, the Fed may act more aggressively, prioritizing employment. Conversely, if wages rise and inflation stalls, a pause or reversal could occur. He recommends investors monitor U\u20113, U\u20116, JOLTS, non\u2011farm payrolls, unemployment duration, weekly claims, and SEP projections, calling unemployment the main thermometer for monetary policy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 09:42 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/analysis/esta-el-desempleo-marcando-el-rumbo-de-la-fed-200478887)\n\n**Numbers Do Not Lie: Why the AfD Leads in the Ruhr Region's Runoff**\nThe article reports that the AfD has advanced candidates in the second round of municipal elections in the Ruhr region, with wins in Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen and Hagen. It cites unemployment data: 280,604 people were registered as unemployed in May\u202f2025, a rise of 14,470 (5.4\u202f%) compared to the previous month. Unemployment rates were highest in Gelsenkirchen (14.9\u202f%) and Duisburg (13.3\u202f%) and lowest in Hagen (12.4\u202f%). The piece notes that 5.98\u202fmillion residents in NRW have a migration background, representing 44.5\u202f% of the population in 2022, up from 30.8\u202f% in 2019. The unemployment rate for people with a migration background was 19.1\u202f% in 2022, three times higher than the 5.7\u202f% rate for German nationals, according to the NRW labour\u2011market report 2023. The article quotes the headline \u2018Die Zahlen l\u00fcgen nicht\u2019 and attributes the AfD\u2019s success to economic hardship and integration challenges. It also reports that 36\u202f% of voters cited the economy as the most important issue, followed by integration and immigration, while only 19\u202f% considered environmental protection decisive.

The slowdown in hiring is expected to prompt the Federal Reserve to reduce borrowing costs, with markets broadly pricing in a cumulative 1\u202fpercentage\u2011point rate cut by September\u202f2026.  Fed Chair Jerome\u202fPowell already announced the first rate cut of the year and noted that the labor market can no longer be described as \u2018very robust\u2019, signalling heightened concern about employment prospects.  Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke\u202fTilley added that a weak labor market, job losses and sluggish services spending will outweigh tariff impacts, leading the Fed to make several cuts between the end of 2025 and early 2026.

The report also finds that in 2025 the average unemployment rate for 23\u2011 to 27\u2011year\u2011olds was 4.59\u202f%, a rise of 1.34\u202fpercentage points from 2019. Among non\u2011degree holders the rate increased by 0.47\u202fpercentage points, while for older university graduates it rose by 0.38\u202fpercentage points. In the tech sector unemployment climbed from 1.98\u202f% in 2019 to 3.02\u202f% in 2025, and the largest gains were seen in arts, design, sports and media, where the rate jumped 1.77\u202fpercentage points. The article notes that half of all ChatGPT messages are sent by users aged 18\u201125, and that a pilot study found a conversational\u2011assistant in customer\u2011support raised productivity by nearly 15\u202f% on average, especially for less\u2011experienced staff. It also cites the Indeed index, which was down 36\u202f% in July\u202f2025 versus the start of 2020, and a decline in Generation\u202fZ\u2019s professional\u2011conscience score from 36 to 33 between 2015\u20112017 and 2023\u20112025. Finally, a 2024 survey reports that Generation\u202fZ expects a \u201csuccessful\u201d salary of $588\u202f000 per year, compared with $270\u202f000 for earlier generations. The piece concludes that the statistical gap for 22\u2011 to 27\u2011year\u2011olds in highly AI\u2011exposed jobs is not universal or definitive, but it will likely accelerate changes in higher\u2011education curricula toward AI\u2011audit, quality\u2011control and critical\u2011thinking skills.

The trend has been stable: 4.2% in April and May, 4.1% in June, 4.2% in July, and 4.3% in August. He states, 'no estamos ante un deterioro s\u00fabito, sino ante un enfriamiento ordenado del mercado laboral.' Job vacancies (JOLTS) fell to 7.18\u202fmillion in July\u202f2025, the lowest since September\u202f2024, which should ease future wage pressures. Unemployment claims rose in September but fell back to 218,000. The Fed\u2019s September\u202f2025 SEP projects a median unemployment of 4.5% this year, converging to 4.1% long\u2011term, indicating confidence in a gradual adjustment. The analyst projects unemployment between 4.4\u20134.6% in the coming quarters; if it rises >0.5\u202fpercentage point above the recent low, the Fed may act more aggressively, prioritizing employment. Conversely, if wages rise and inflation stalls, a pause or reversal could occur. He recommends investors monitor U\u20113, U\u20116, JOLTS, non\u2011farm payrolls, unemployment duration, weekly claims, and SEP projections, calling unemployment the main thermometer for monetary policy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 09:42 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/analysis/esta-el-desempleo-marcando-el-rumbo-de-la-fed-200478887)\n\n**STAYING SANGUINE ABOUT THE HORIZON**\nTom Barkin, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, delivered a speech on September\u202f26\u202f2025 in which he explained the Fed\u2019s current economic outlook and policy stance. He noted that inflation has remained above the Fed\u2019s 2\u202f% target, with a headline rate of 2.7\u202f% and core inflation at 2.9\u202f% (the monthly increase in August was 2.8\u202f% annualized). He highlighted that the labor market is under downward pressure: the three\u2011month average job growth was only 29,000, the hiring rate is near Great Recession lows, and the unemployment rate has risen to 4.3\u202f%. Barkin argued that the labor supply is shrinking\u2014border crossings have fallen and the number of people over 65 leaving the workforce has risen by an average of 1.3\u202fmillion per year\u2014while demand remains solid, partly buoyed by recent tax\u2011bill stimulus and continued consumer spending. He also pointed to improving productivity, driven by automation and AI, as a countervailing force that could temper inflation. Barkin concluded that the Fed\u2019s recent 25\u2011basis\u2011point rate cut to just over 4\u202f% represents a move toward a more neutral stance, aiming to balance the twin mandates of price stability and maximum employment. He emphasized that, despite the \u201cshaky ground\u201d of the current economic environment, focusing on the horizon can provide a more stable path forward.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[InsuranceNewsNet](https://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/staying-sanguine-about-the-horizon)\n\n**Dutch unemployment rises to 3.9% in August: CBS**\nIn August\u202f2025 the Dutch Employee Insurance Agency ('UWV') recorded 187,400 active unemployment (WW) benefits, a slight increase of 200 from July.

Female employment is on the rise, with an increase in job applications. Experts attribute this to the transition periods in the labor market and the growing prevalence of contract-based work. Seasonal fluctuations in agriculture, food, and construction sectors The demand for labor in the agriculture, food, and construction sectors has increased. This rise is linked to seasonal factors, particularly the peak period of outdoor activities in spring and summer.

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts and disciplinary perspectives, there is a strong consensus that the probability of Dutch unemployment exceeding 5% in any month of 2025 is low. Recent data show the unemployment rate at 3.9% (August 2025), with only a slow, modest upward drift from recent years when rates held steady between 3\u20134%. The experts point to multiple reinforcing factors that make a sharp jump above 5% unlikely: a historically low base rate for Dutch unemployment exceeding 5% (last seen only during the global financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 shock); robust Dutch labor market institutions and policy responses (including strong welfare supports and active labor market policies); labor force expansion driven mainly by higher participation rather than mass layoffs; and continued sectoral demand and flexibility. While all forecasters acknowledge downside risks from global economic trends (such as a possible eurozone recession, global slowdown, or external shocks like energy crises or geopolitical instability), they agree that no such severe shock is imminent or currently developing. Scenario analyses indicate that only a sudden, severe external or domestic shock\u2014deemed a tail risk\u2014would suffice to push unemployment above 5% within the 2025 calendar year. Without such an event, the gradual trend and institutional resilience of the Dutch economy make a Yes outcome improbable. Assigned probabilities of breaching 5% concentrate tightly between 5\u201310%, with most experts landing at 7\u20138%. Therefore, the group consensus is that the likelihood of Dutch unemployment exceeding 5% in any 2025 month is low, barring an unprecedented and unforeseeable crisis.",
