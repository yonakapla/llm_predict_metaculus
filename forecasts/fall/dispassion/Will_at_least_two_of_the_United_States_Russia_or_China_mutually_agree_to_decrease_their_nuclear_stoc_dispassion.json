However, the existential stakes and the simplicity of a short extension lower the threshold for action. The base rate for last-minute arms control extensions is significant.

The main risk is that rhetoric may not translate into a formal treaty, especially given New START\u2019s suspension by Russia in 2023 and ongoing mutual suspicions. However, the alignment of public statements and looming deadline make a signed bilateral extension or freeze very likely. China\u2019s consistent refusal to join such agreements, and the lack of any evidence of a change in Chinese policy, makes a trilateral deal extremely unlikely. However, the question only requires two of the three states to mutually agree, so a US-Russia deal suffices. Overall, while a non-trivial risk of bureaucratic or political breakdown exists, the probability is strongly in favor of a US-Russia bilateral agreement before the deadline.",

The obstacles are significant: the short time frame, lack of active formal negotiations, and especially the verification and trust breakdowns (with inspections suspended and Russia at war in Ukraine). China is almost certainly out, so only a US-Russia deal matters. The probability of fast-track negotiation and signature under such conditions is historically low, but the repeated, high-level signaling by both leaders justifies moving above pure base rates.

There is strong precedent for last-minute bilateral extensions (e.g., New START in 2021), and both Trump and Putin have made unusually direct, public statements in support of such an extension. The technical requirements for extending an existing agreement, especially one negotiated previously by the same two parties, are considerably lower than for new or expanded multilateral deals.

The status quo base rate for failure remains high, and while last-minute extensions have occurred, they typically followed months of preparatory work and less adversarial conditions.

Unlike more pessimistic or multilateral-focused perspectives, your reasoning weighs the correct procedural bar for a YES and recognizes that, while the environment is tense, the technical and diplomatic hurdles for a short bilateral extension are much lower than for new or expanded agreements.

This aligns well with Rational Choice expectations: while both actors have some incentive to avoid an arms race, the inertia of inaction and the transaction costs of treaty formalization remain high\u2014especially with verification mechanisms suspended and trust eroded by years of conflict. Your 35% estimate accurately reflects a non-trivial, deadline-driven increase in probability relative to historical base rates, without succumbing to the overconfidence that can result from taking public statements at face value.

The public, reciprocal signaling from both Trump and Putin is unusually direct and pragmatic, and both have the executive latitude to sign a minimalist extension\u2014especially given the low procedural bar (a signature, not ratification). Historical precedent shows that face-saving, last-minute deals have occurred even amid crises, when both sides perceive a shared interest in avoiding a breakdown. While the base rate for new treaties is indeed low, the probability of a bilateral, symbolic extension in this particular window\u2014given the convergence of elite signaling and a looming deadline\u2014should be somewhat higher, possibly in the 40\u201360% range, to reflect these unique enabling factors."

The status quo bias in arms control is very strong, especially under the current adversarial context: Russia's suspension of New START participation, the ongoing war in Ukraine, halted verification, and ongoing mutual suspicion.

Speaking to journalists outside the White House, Trump stated, 'That seems like a good idea,' signaling potential diplomatic thaw amid ongoing tensions. The comment was well received in Moscow, where Kirill Dmitriev, Putin\u2019s economic advisor and close Kremlin figure, said both countries are 'quite open' to reaching an agreement on the extension. Putin had previously criticized the U.S. on October 3, 2025, for delaying a response, asserting that if the U.S. does not need the extension, Russia also does not need it, and emphasizing Russia\u2019s confidence in its nuclear deterrent. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and 700 launchers, and includes mutual inspections. Originally set to expire in February 2026, Russia unilaterally suspended its participation in February 2023 following the start of the war in Ukraine. Moscow has since advocated for future arms agreements to include China, France, and the UK, citing a 'new multipolar order' and the expansion of nuclear arsenals beyond the Cold War axis. In late September, Putin proposed extending New START until February 2026, maintaining the existing numerical limits and stating Russia is prepared to uphold these limits for one year beyond February 5, 2026, provided the U.S. does not take actions that undermine strategic deterrence. Despite prior high-level meetings, such as the August meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska, formal negotiations on the extension have not yet begun.

According to American expert Daryl Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association, Trump's approval effectively amounted to accepting Moscow's initiative. Kimball welcomed the positive response, stating that the organization urges both Republicans and Democrats to support Trump\u2019s decision to maintain reasonable limits on the world\u2019s two largest and most lethal nuclear arsenals. He emphasized that maintaining these constraints for at least one year after the treaty\u2019s expiration would reduce tensions, prevent an expensive arms race, and create diplomatic leverage to curb China\u2019s nuclear buildup. Kimball added that the Kremlin and the White House must now formalize the agreement and immediately instruct their teams to begin negotiations on a new, more comprehensive treaty. Trump previously described the proposal as 'a good idea' during a briefing on the South Lawn of the White House. The START treaty, signed by Russia and the U.S. in 2010, limits the number of deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems.

Kimball emphasized that the Kremlin and the White House must now formalize the arrangement and immediately begin negotiations on a new comprehensive agreement.

Putin had previously indicated Russia's willingness to extend the treaty for one year beyond its expiration date of February 5, 2026, if the United States takes similar action. During a meeting of the Russian Security Council, Putin emphasized that the treaty has played a 'positive and important role' in maintaining strategic stability and predictability in offensive nuclear weapons for nearly 15 years. He warned that a complete rejection of the treaty's legacy would be 'a mistaken and short-sighted move' with negative implications for the goals of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The New START treaty, signed on April 8, 2010, and extended for five years in February 2021 without preconditions, requires both parties to limit their strategic arsenals to 700 delivery vehicles, 1,550 warheads, and 800 launchers. Russia suspended its participation in February 2023, citing the United States' 'destruction of the legal basis for arms control and security' due to NATO's military deployment against Russia. However, Russia has consistently stated its intention to comply with the treaty's limits during its active period.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[AlMomento.net](https://almomento.net/ve-es-buena-idea-decision-putin-prorrogar-tratado-sobre-armas/)\n\n**Russia Calls for U.S. Talks on Nuclear Weapons, Urges Future Inclusion of Britain and France - EconoTimes**\nRussia has called for direct U.S.\u2013Russia talks on reducing strategic nuclear weapons, while insisting that Britain and France eventually be included. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday that although the New START treaty is a bilateral agreement, long\u2011term European and global security requires addressing the arsenals of all major powers. He noted that Russia and the United States hold the world\u2019s largest stockpiles, while Britain and France \u2013 never parties to New START \u2013 maintain roughly 250\u2013300 warheads each. Peskov warned that ignoring those European arsenals would undermine long\u2011term security. President Vladimir Putin had earlier proposed that Russia and the U.S. voluntarily maintain the New START limits for one year after its 2026 expiration, provided Washington agreed. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the proposal as 'pretty good,' but said the decision rests with President Donald Trump. Trump has previously expressed interest in expanding arms\u2011control talks to include China. New START, signed in 2010 by Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limits each side to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 700 delivery vehicles. The treaty was extended in 2021 under Joe Biden but suspended by Russia in 2023 amid tensions over the war in Ukraine, though Moscow says it still observes the limits. The future of arms control remains uncertain as Ukraine pushes for harsher sanctions on Moscow and Washington weighs whether to pursue bilateral or expanded talks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[EconoTimes](https://econotimes.com/Russia-Calls-for-US-Talks-on-Nuclear-Weapons-Urges-Future-Inclusion-of-Britain-and-France-1721811)\n\n**Putin Proposes Temporary Extension of Strategic Weapons Reduction Treaty with Trump**\nOn September 22\u202f2025, Russian President Vladimir\u202fPutin announced at a Security Council meeting that he is ready to extend the New\u202fSTART treaty for an additional year, but only if U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump agrees to do the same (Reuters). The New\u202fSTART, signed in 2010 and effective from 2011, is a bilateral agreement that limits deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550 and delivery vehicles to 800, and contains 16 articles. The treaty originally ran until February\u202f5\u202f2026, after a five\u2011year extension.

The New\u202fSTART follows the original START\u202fI signed in 1991 between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which was in force from 1994 to 2009; attempts to negotiate START\u202fII and III failed.

'O presidente dos Estados Unidos disse j\u00e1 ter tratado do tema com Vladimir Putin e afirmou acreditar que Xi Jinping aceitar\u00e1 se engajar nas conversas,' the piece notes.

In 2024, the Biden administration sought to open a similar dialogue but paused it after China suspended meetings in protest of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.

Trump confirmed his plan to meet North Korean leader Kim\u202fChun\u2011Un this year, noting that denuclearization will be a key priority in his second term.  These remarks come as the New\u202fSTART treaty between the United States and Russia, which limits strategic warheads and delivery systems, expires on 5\u202fFebruary\u202f2026.  Russia has warned that extending the treaty is unlikely, while the Biden administration had previously sought to involve China in official negotiations without success.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 06:35 PM\nSource:[lb.ua](https://lb.ua/world/2025/08/26/693214_tramp_znovu_zaklikav_rosiyu_kitay.html)\n\n**Trump renews initiative for negotiations on denuclearization with Russia and China**\nPresident Donald Trump announced that he wants to restart talks on denuclearization with Russia and China, echoing a proposal he made earlier in his first term.

He also said, 'N\u00e3o podemos deixar que as armas nucleares proliferem. Temos que acabar com as armas nucleares.'

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether at least two of the United States, Russia, or China will mutually agree to decrease their nuclear stockpiles before 2026 converge around several core themes. All experts agree that a trilateral agreement including China is virtually impossible: China has categorically refused participation, citing its much smaller arsenal and different strategic calculus. Almost all forecasters see the only plausible path to a YES as a bilateral US-Russia agreement, most likely an extension of the New START treaty.\n\nThere is strong consensus across perspectives that both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have recently and publicly signaled openness to a one-year extension of New START. Experts note the historical precedent for last-minute extensions or arms control deals but also cite the extremely short remaining timeline (roughly 2.5\u20133.5 months) as a significant barrier. Several underline that a signed (not just verbally agreed) formal treaty is required for question resolution, which adds bureaucratic and political friction, especially given ongoing US-Russia mistrust, the Ukraine war, suspended verification regimes, and domestic opposition in both countries. \n\nForecasts diverge on their probability estimates, reflecting discipline-specific pessimism or optimism about agreement under high tension. Pessimistic views emphasize the low base rate for arms control treaties under acute rivalry, security dilemmas, bureaucratic inertia, and the lack of active negotiations. These tend to cluster in the 20\u201338% range. More optimistic forecasts point to the mutual leadership signaling, deadline pressure, clear incentives to avoid an unconstrained arms race, and recent patterns of last-minute extensions, resulting in probabilities around 57\u201385%. A middle group estimates probabilities in the 60\u201368% range, balancing increased signaling and the procedural hurdles.\n\nAll scenarios for a NO outcome center on public signaling failing to materialize as a signed agreement due to procedural, political, or trust obstacles\u2014while YES scenarios wholly depend on rapid US-Russia formalization of a one-year extension (with China uninvolved).\n\nIn summary, while there is broad agreement that a US-Russia bilateral extension is both necessary and possible, experts are split on its likelihood, with overall sentiment leaning slightly above the historical base rate due to strong leadership rhetoric, but tempered by significant operational and political risks. Most expect China to remain outside any agreement. The aggregated probability is likely between 35\u201365%, with no clear consensus above 70%.",
