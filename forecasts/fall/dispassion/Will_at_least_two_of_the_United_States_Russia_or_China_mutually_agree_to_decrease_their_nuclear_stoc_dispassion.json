Trump and Putin have both expressed support for a one-year extension of New START, which would maintain current limits rather than decrease them further. The fine print suggests that an extension maintaining the current (capped) levels, as in the prior New START extension, might not qualify unless it explicitly involves reductions below current numbers. However, the news coverage and expert commentary suggest the extension would only maintain limits, not reduce stockpiles. Moreover, even if the extension did count, as of October 8, 2025, there is no formal signed document\u2014only positive statements. Historical precedent shows such agreements take more than a few weeks to negotiate and sign, especially in the current climate of mistrust. The base rate for new nuclear reduction agreements between the US and Russia in a 3-month window, with relations at a low ebb, is extremely low. Therefore, while there is some nonzero chance that a last-minute extension will be signed and might resolve the question as YES (depending on Metaculus' interpretation of 'decrease'), the balance of factors makes a NO outcome much more likely.",

However, the historical base rate for hammering out even limited arms control agreements under adversarial conditions is low, and Russia\u2019s insistence on including UK/France and China's open refusal to participate are complicating factors. Still, the bilateral dynamic between the US and Russia is unique: both possess the overwhelming majority of strategic nuclear weapons and have a long history of last-minute extensions (e.g., the 2021 extension was agreed mere days before expiry). Given the strong diplomatic signaling, the narrow time window, and the strategic interests of both sides in avoiding a complete collapse of arms control, a last-minute executive-level agreement to extend New START limits for one year is plausible. The major risk is that talks break down over verification or political posturing, but the low ratification threshold and the perceived mutual benefit make a 'YES' outcome modestly more likely than not. Involvement of China is highly unlikely, but not needed for 'YES'. I estimate the probability at 62%.",

However, the current proposals and all public statements indicate only an extension of limits, not a reduction. The question requires an agreement to 'decrease' stockpiles, not just maintain them. China is almost certain to stay out of any reduction framework before 2026, given its official position, so the only plausible path to YES is a US-Russia treaty that includes even a symbolic reduction. No current reporting or official statements suggest that the US or Russia is proposing new reductions, only maintenance of the status quo. The base rate for new reductions (not just limit extensions) is very low, especially in periods of high tension. Therefore, despite the positive rhetoric about arms control, the probability that at least two of the US, Russia, or China mutually agree to decrease nuclear stockpiles before 2026 is low, though not zero. The most likely outcome is a status quo-maintaining extension, which does not resolve YES.",

The diplomatic context is indeed more favorable than average, but positive rhetoric alone, especially absent any initiated formal negotiation or draft text as of October, is rarely sufficient to yield a signed instrument within 3 months, especially with suspended inspections and deep mutual mistrust. Additionally, the base rate for last-minute extensions is non-negligible but applies to extensions of existing treaties, not necessarily to new reduction agreements, and the status quo inertia (especially amid active conflict and domestic opposition) is likely understated in this forecast. Thus, while optimism about diplomatic signaling is warranted, the probability should be moderated by the structural and procedural headwinds unique to arms control treaty practice."

From the perspective of verification and compliance standards, this estimate insufficiently accounts for technical and practical obstacles\u2014especially the suspension of mutual inspections and the lack of even a framework for resuming verification activities. In practice, both parties need to resolve at least some minimal compliance and transparency mechanisms before signing, even for a stopgap extension, and there is no evidence that these talks have meaningfully advanced. Moreover, the forecast overstates the capacity of institutional inertia to overcome active mistrust and ongoing conflict; while arms control institutions can enable cooperation, they are not self-executing, and the lack of recent formal negotiation activity is a profound impediment. Finally, the forecast does not sufficiently weigh the base rate of last-minute arms control agreements failing, even with public support, due to technical or political breakdowns.

While some other forecasts treat an extension of New START limits as functionally equivalent to a decrease, this is not necessarily supported by the plain sense of 'decrease' in diplomatic and legal usage. The forecaster also rightly grounds their estimate in the historical base rate for new reductions (as opposed to extensions), which is extremely low in periods of high tension and absent formal negotiations.

The security dilemma, in this case, is compounded by the war in Ukraine, suspended inspections, and Russia's calls to include UK and France in future arrangements\u2014all factors that can easily stall or derail the process. The argument also appears to treat positive executive signaling as nearly sufficient for treaty action, when in fact, the technical, bureaucratic, and alliance politics involved in U.S.-Russia arms control are formidable, especially in a compressed timeline. The base rate for even minimalist agreements at such a late hour\u2014despite public support\u2014remains well below even odds, given the many recent examples of last-minute breakdowns or inertia.

From a China Studies (Chinese Foreign Policy Analysis) perspective, this interpretation is problematic, as it conflates a cap or maintenance of existing stockpile limits with an actual reduction, which is what the question explicitly requires ('decrease'). China's own repeated diplomatic language distinguishes sharply between 'maintaining' and 'reducing' forces, a distinction that is also reflected in the legal and diplomatic practice of arms control. The resolution criteria require an agreement to decrease, not simply to extend existing limits, and there is no indication from current proposals or news reporting that any reduction below current levels is being discussed or pursued; both sides are focused on extending the status quo. Furthermore, this forecast underestimates the inertia and mistrust that dominate Chinese strategic thinking and US-Russia relations, and overstates the likelihood of even a symbolic decrease being agreed to under current conditions.

Moreover, the forecast overlooks the importance of relative gains and the fear of exploitation\u2014core neorealist concerns\u2014which are heightened in the current climate. The base rate for last-minute arms agreements rises only when both technical and political tracks are moving, which is not evident here. The 70% estimate substantially overstates the likelihood, given the enduring incentives for both sides to hedge, delay, or use arms control as leverage rather than to actually sign away any capabilities, even symbolically."

From a liberal institutionalist perspective, while institutions and shared regimes do facilitate cooperation, their effectiveness depends heavily on credible compliance and transparency mechanisms. The suspension of inspections under New START and the absence of concrete negotiations to restore them are real obstacles to trust and treaty formalization. This forecaster rightly points out that, historically, public support from leaders is frequently insufficient to overcome technical and procedural hurdles, especially when verification is at stake. Their estimate is appropriately cautious and serves as a necessary counterweight to forecasts that overemphasize elite signaling and institutional momentum. This approach ensures that the base rate for successful agreements\u2014given unresolved verification problems\u2014is weighted appropriately, making the forecast methodologically sound."

By assigning a probability (62%) that is above even odds, but not extreme, the forecast properly weighs the urgency of the deadline and leadership signaling against the formidable structural and procedural obstacles. This balanced approach avoids both excessive pessimism (which would overweight the status quo and base rate) and unwarranted optimism (which would treat elite signaling as nearly sufficient). The explicit recognition that a formal signature\u2014not ratification\u2014is all that is required for resolution also aligns with the fine print, and the acknowledgment that nearly all of the probability comes from a bilateral U.S.\u2013Russia agreement (not involving China) matches both historical precedent and current diplomatic realities. This reasoning is robust and reflects a nuanced appreciation of both deterrence logic and real-world political incentives."

This forecaster rigorously distinguishes between rhetorical alignment and actual movement toward a signed instrument, noting that even last-minute arms control agreements typically require groundwork and bureaucratic preparation that are not evidenced here. Moreover, their skepticism regarding whether a mere extension (as opposed to an explicit reduction) would satisfy the resolution criteria is methodologically sound: the fine print's emphasis on 'decrease' rather than 'cap' is a nontrivial interpretive point that could affect resolution. By foregrounding status quo inertia and the slow-moving nature of treaty practice, this forecast ensures that the base rate for new or even extended agreements in high-tension windows is not overstated.

From a Two Level Games perspective, this calculation underestimates the potential for domestic veto players and bureaucratic inertia to derail or delay formal agreement even when leaders are aligned at the international level. Rational choice approaches sometimes assume unitary, interest-maximizing actors, but in reality, both the U.S. and Russia face internal opposition, complex bureaucratic processes, and competing domestic priorities (e.g., U.S. Congressional skepticism, Russian hardliners, military-industrial interests). The short time frame exacerbates these risks, as even minimal technical or political delays could push the process past the deadline. Furthermore, this forecast assumes that mutual signaling will translate quickly into formalization, overlooking the substantial history of breakdowns at this final hurdle, especially under high mistrust and without resumed verification. While the incentives for agreement are real, the probability is likely overstated due to insufficient attention to the 'Level II' (domestic) constraints that can easily scuttle even leader-driven deals."

While institutions can facilitate cooperation, their effectiveness is contingent on credible commitments and the ability to enforce compliance\u2014both of which are undermined by the current suspension of inspections and deep mistrust. Furthermore, the forecast appears to conflate the existence of a shared institutional framework (New START) with a guarantee of agreement, underestimating the risk that states will defect, stall, or use delay as a bargaining strategy when domestic or security interests dictate. The probability estimate is thus too high given the unresolved verification issues, lack of ongoing formal negotiations, and persistent domestic and international obstacles. A more balanced approach would give greater weight to the likelihood of bargaining failure or procedural delay, even in the face of positive diplomatic rhetoric."

The forecaster also appropriately highlights the historic tendency for such agreements to materialize at the last minute\u2014sometimes not at all\u2014and the crucial distinction between rhetorical support and the legal, procedural requirements for a signed treaty. The emphasis on the base rate for last-minute extensions, the importance of formal diplomatic steps, and the likelihood that any agreement would be minimalist (rather than a substantive reduction) all reflect a strong grasp of both arms control dynamics and the deterrence logic underlying such treaties.

From an arms control negotiation practice perspective, this estimate underweights two critical issues: (1) the technical and bureaucratic requirements for formalizing even a minimalist extension, which historically have required more than just elite signaling and involve complex legal and procedural steps, and (2) the ambiguity regarding whether a mere extension\u2014rather than a reduction\u2014truly satisfies the 'decrease' criterion in the resolution. The diplomatic context is indeed more favorable than average, but positive rhetoric alone, especially absent any initiated formal negotiation or draft text as of October, is rarely sufficient to yield a signed instrument within 3 months, especially with suspended inspections and deep mutual mistrust. Additionally, the base rate for last-minute extensions is non-negligible but applies to extensions of existing treaties, not necessarily to new reduction agreements, and the status quo inertia (especially amid active conflict and domestic opposition) is likely understated in this forecast. Thus, while optimism about diplomatic signaling is warranted, the probability should be moderated by the structural and procedural headwinds unique to arms control treaty practice."

While some arguments for a higher probability\u2014such as the low threshold for a signed agreement and the mutual interest in avoiding an arms race\u2014are valid, there is still no evidence of an initiated formal negotiation or draft text, and the base rate for such agreements (especially amid current tensions and practical obstacles) is low.

However, my critique of these arguments\u2014shared by some other arms control specialists and China studies experts\u2014remains: the status quo of mutual mistrust, lack of resumed verification mechanisms, and the absence of an active, formal negotiation process are critical obstacles. Importantly, the fine print and discussion highlight that merely extending current limits may not suffice if it does not explicitly result in decreased stockpiles, a point several in the group also emphasized. The strongest counterargument is the precedent of last-minute extensions, but those typically occur with more preparatory work and less severe geopolitical antagonism. Thus, while I can see justification for a small upward revision to account for the unique diplomatic window and executive-level signaling, the base rate and compliance hurdles remain paramount.

My critique of the Neorealist position reinforced the analytic distinction between capping and reducing, which is also recognized by Chinese diplomatic language and practice. Conversely, some lower-probability forecasts (e.g., Treaty Negotiation Practice, Verification and Compliance) share my concern about procedural and definitional hurdles.

Speaking to journalists outside the White House, Trump stated, 'That seems like a good idea,' signaling potential diplomatic thaw amid ongoing tensions. The comment was well received in Moscow, where Kirill Dmitriev, Putin\u2019s economic advisor and close Kremlin figure, said both countries are 'quite open' to reaching an agreement on the extension. Putin had previously criticized the U.S. on October 3, 2025, for delaying a response, asserting that if the U.S. does not need the extension, Russia also does not need it, and emphasizing Russia\u2019s confidence in its nuclear deterrent. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and 700 launchers, and includes mutual inspections. Originally set to expire in February 2026, Russia unilaterally suspended its participation in February 2023 following the start of the war in Ukraine. Moscow has since advocated for future arms agreements to include China, France, and the UK, citing a 'new multipolar order' and the expansion of nuclear arsenals beyond the Cold War axis. In late September, Putin proposed extending New START until February 2026, maintaining the existing numerical limits and stating Russia is prepared to uphold these limits for one year beyond February 5, 2026, provided the U.S. does not take actions that undermine strategic deterrence. Despite prior high-level meetings, such as the August meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska, formal negotiations on the extension have not yet begun.

According to American expert Daryl Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association, Trump's approval effectively amounted to accepting Moscow's initiative. Kimball welcomed the positive response, stating that the organization urges both Republicans and Democrats to support Trump\u2019s decision to maintain reasonable limits on the world\u2019s two largest and most lethal nuclear arsenals. He emphasized that maintaining these constraints for at least one year after the treaty\u2019s expiration would reduce tensions, prevent an expensive arms race, and create diplomatic leverage to curb China\u2019s nuclear buildup. Kimball added that the Kremlin and the White House must now formalize the agreement and immediately instruct their teams to begin negotiations on a new, more comprehensive treaty. Trump previously described the proposal as 'a good idea' during a briefing on the South Lawn of the White House. The START treaty, signed by Russia and the U.S. in 2010, limits the number of deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems.

Putin had previously indicated Russia's willingness to extend the treaty for one year beyond its expiration date of February 5, 2026, if the United States takes similar action. During a meeting of the Russian Security Council, Putin emphasized that the treaty has played a 'positive and important role' in maintaining strategic stability and predictability in offensive nuclear weapons for nearly 15 years. He warned that a complete rejection of the treaty's legacy would be 'a mistaken and short-sighted move' with negative implications for the goals of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The New START treaty, signed on April 8, 2010, and extended for five years in February 2021 without preconditions, requires both parties to limit their strategic arsenals to 700 delivery vehicles, 1,550 warheads, and 800 launchers. Russia suspended its participation in February 2023, citing the United States' 'destruction of the legal basis for arms control and security' due to NATO's military deployment against Russia. However, Russia has consistently stated its intention to comply with the treaty's limits during its active period.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[AlMomento.net](https://almomento.net/ve-es-buena-idea-decision-putin-prorrogar-tratado-sobre-armas/)\n\n**Russia Calls for U.S. Talks on Nuclear Weapons, Urges Future Inclusion of Britain and France - EconoTimes**\nRussia has called for direct U.S.\u2013Russia talks on reducing strategic nuclear weapons, while insisting that Britain and France eventually be included. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday that although the New START treaty is a bilateral agreement, long\u2011term European and global security requires addressing the arsenals of all major powers. He noted that Russia and the United States hold the world\u2019s largest stockpiles, while Britain and France \u2013 never parties to New START \u2013 maintain roughly 250\u2013300 warheads each. Peskov warned that ignoring those European arsenals would undermine long\u2011term security. President Vladimir Putin had earlier proposed that Russia and the U.S. voluntarily maintain the New START limits for one year after its 2026 expiration, provided Washington agreed. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the proposal as 'pretty good,' but said the decision rests with President Donald Trump. Trump has previously expressed interest in expanding arms\u2011control talks to include China. New START, signed in 2010 by Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limits each side to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 700 delivery vehicles. The treaty was extended in 2021 under Joe Biden but suspended by Russia in 2023 amid tensions over the war in Ukraine, though Moscow says it still observes the limits. The future of arms control remains uncertain as Ukraine pushes for harsher sanctions on Moscow and Washington weighs whether to pursue bilateral or expanded talks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[EconoTimes](https://econotimes.com/Russia-Calls-for-US-Talks-on-Nuclear-Weapons-Urges-Future-Inclusion-of-Britain-and-France-1721811)\n\n**Putin Proposes Temporary Extension of Strategic Weapons Reduction Treaty with Trump**\nOn September 22\u202f2025, Russian President Vladimir\u202fPutin announced at a Security Council meeting that he is ready to extend the New\u202fSTART treaty for an additional year, but only if U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump agrees to do the same (Reuters).

'Donald Trump afirmou que pretende abrir negocia\u00e7\u00f5es de desnucleariza\u00e7\u00e3o com R\u00fassia e China em meio \u00e0 aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o do fim do New START, o \u00faltimo tratado de controle de armas entre Washington e Moscou, que expira em fevereiro de 2026,' the article reports. He said he has already discussed the issue with President Vladimir\u202fPutin and believes Chinese President Xi\u202fJinping will agree to engage. 'O presidente dos Estados Unidos disse j\u00e1 ter tratado do tema com Vladimir Putin e afirmou acreditar que Xi Jinping aceitar\u00e1 se engajar nas conversas,' the piece notes. Trump also hinted at a meeting with North Korean leader Kim\u202fJong\u202fUn. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits the strategic arsenals of the United States and Russia. 'O New START, assinado em 2010, limita os arsenais estrat\u00e9gicos dos EUA e da R\u00fassia,' the article states. Moscow has warned that renewal is unlikely, and previous attempts to involve China failed because Beijing claims its nuclear stockpile is far smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia. In 2024, the Biden administration sought to open a similar dialogue but paused it after China suspended meetings in protest of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Trump\u2019s re\u2011emphasis on nuclear control comes amid a diplomatic impasse and growing rivalry among the U.S., Russia, China and North Korea, raising concerns that the collapse of New START could spark a new arms race in an already unstable geopolitical environment.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 08:43 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2025/08/trump-quer-falar-china-e-russia-sobre-desnuclearizacao.shtml)\n\n**Trump Calls on Russia and China for Nuclear Disarmament Talks**\nPresident Donald\u202fTrump has urged Russia and China to resume nuclear\u2011disarmament talks, saying it is \"very important\" to achieve denuclearization.

    "summary": "Experts assess a modest chance that at least two of the United States, Russia, or China will mutually agree to decrease their nuclear stockpiles before 2026, with the consensus that a US-Russia agreement is the only plausible path, as Chinese participation is seen as nearly impossible. Most forecasts emphasize positive public signaling and urgent diplomatic pressure due to the impending expiration of New START. Many note that both US President Trump and Russian President Putin have expressed support for a one-year extension of New START, which\u2014if formalized by signing\u2014could meet the question criteria if it includes explicit reductions. However, crucial obstacles persist: Russia's suspended participation and mutual inspections, the ongoing Ukraine war, deep geopolitical mistrust, domestic political constraints in both countries, and the technical and procedural time required to formalize and sign even a minimalist agreement. Experts using historical base rates point out that formal arms reduction treaties\u2014even extensions\u2014are rare under current adversarial conditions and usually take months or years to negotiate. While the formal bar for question resolution is low (signature only, not full ratification), most experts assess the probability of a qualifying agreement being signed before the deadline as only moderately above base rates due to time pressure and unusual elite support, resulting in a wide but generally sub-50% range of probabilities. A few (from liberal institutionalist or rational choice perspectives) are moderately optimistic (55\u201371%), citing a history of last-minute extensions and clear incentives for both parties, while others (especially arms control and China experts) are more skeptical (13\u201320%), focusing on the lack of negotiation progress and the likelihood that an extension will merely maintain current levels rather than require actual reductions. All agree that China is highly unlikely to join any agreement, leaving a bilateral US\u2013Russia extension as the sole realistic scenario for a 'YES' outcome. The most probable 'NO' scenario is that talks stall over verification or political issues, no new treaty is signed before the deadline, and New START expires without replacement. On balance, forecasts center around a modest but real possibility, with prevailing skepticism that a formal, signed reduction agreement will materialize before 2026.",
