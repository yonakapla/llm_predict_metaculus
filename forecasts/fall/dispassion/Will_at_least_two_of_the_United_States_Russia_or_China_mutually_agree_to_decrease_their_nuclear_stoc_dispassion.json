However, there has not yet been a formal signing, and serious obstacles remain: verification measures are suspended, trust is low, and bureaucratic inertia is substantial. Including China is extremely unlikely within the timeframe and is not necessary for YES resolution. The historical base rate for such agreements in a compressed timeframe is low, but not zero\u2014especially given the strong political signaling and the existential nature of nuclear risk. In summary, while the status quo and procedural/bureaucratic obstacles dominate, the clear willingness of both leaders to extend New START in some form is a significant positive outlier.

While some may see your probability as high, your application of liberal institutionalist logic and attention to precedent make your forecast a valuable corrective to excessive pessimism rooted in status quo bias or overemphasis on bureaucratic inertia."

While neorealism rightly stresses structural anarchy and security dilemmas, it can overlook how elites sometimes use institutionalized arms control (especially extensions rather than new reductions) as a risk-hedging tool, even absent deep trust. The current situation is not one of full-scale cooperation, but both Trump and Putin have strong incentives\u2014reputational, strategic, and bureaucratic\u2014to avoid the optics and instability of unconstrained arsenals. The procedural bar for resolution is lower than for most international agreements: a signed extension or protocol suffices. Though you are correct to emphasize status quo bias and the ongoing Ukraine war, the history of arms control (e.g., 2010 New START, 2021 extension) includes multiple instances of brinkmanship followed by minimal, face-saving deals. These don't require profound trust, only elite calculation that the benefits of an extension outweigh the risks of failure. Therefore, while the risks are real, the probability should be somewhat higher to reflect the pragmatic logic of last-minute arms control extensions in great power politics."

Game theory does capture the logic of mutual benefit under threat of an arms race, but it may underappreciate the inertia and risk aversion in bureaucracies, as well as the real possibility of last-minute breakdowns due to unforeseen events or domestic spoilers. Historical precedent shows that while brinkmanship sometimes produces a deal, it just as often results in stalemate, especially when both sides calculate that time is on their side or that concessions could be seen as weakness.

Speaking to journalists outside the White House, Trump stated, 'That seems like a good idea,' signaling potential diplomatic thaw amid ongoing tensions. The comment was well received in Moscow, where Kirill Dmitriev, Putin\u2019s economic advisor and close Kremlin figure, said both countries are 'quite open' to reaching an agreement on the extension. Putin had previously criticized the U.S. on October 3, 2025, for delaying a response, asserting that if the U.S. does not need the extension, Russia also does not need it, and emphasizing Russia\u2019s confidence in its nuclear deterrent. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and 700 launchers, and includes mutual inspections. Originally set to expire in February 2026, Russia unilaterally suspended its participation in February 2023 following the start of the war in Ukraine. Moscow has since advocated for future arms agreements to include China, France, and the UK, citing a 'new multipolar order' and the expansion of nuclear arsenals beyond the Cold War axis. In late September, Putin proposed extending New START until February 2026, maintaining the existing numerical limits and stating Russia is prepared to uphold these limits for one year beyond February 5, 2026, provided the U.S. does not take actions that undermine strategic deterrence. Despite prior high-level meetings, such as the August meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska, formal negotiations on the extension have not yet begun.

According to American expert Daryl Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association, Trump's approval effectively amounted to accepting Moscow's initiative. Kimball welcomed the positive response, stating that the organization urges both Republicans and Democrats to support Trump\u2019s decision to maintain reasonable limits on the world\u2019s two largest and most lethal nuclear arsenals. He emphasized that maintaining these constraints for at least one year after the treaty\u2019s expiration would reduce tensions, prevent an expensive arms race, and create diplomatic leverage to curb China\u2019s nuclear buildup. Kimball added that the Kremlin and the White House must now formalize the agreement and immediately instruct their teams to begin negotiations on a new, more comprehensive treaty. Trump previously described the proposal as 'a good idea' during a briefing on the South Lawn of the White House. The START treaty, signed by Russia and the U.S. in 2010, limits the number of deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems.

Putin had previously indicated Russia's willingness to extend the treaty for one year beyond its expiration date of February 5, 2026, if the United States takes similar action. During a meeting of the Russian Security Council, Putin emphasized that the treaty has played a 'positive and important role' in maintaining strategic stability and predictability in offensive nuclear weapons for nearly 15 years. He warned that a complete rejection of the treaty's legacy would be 'a mistaken and short-sighted move' with negative implications for the goals of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The New START treaty, signed on April 8, 2010, and extended for five years in February 2021 without preconditions, requires both parties to limit their strategic arsenals to 700 delivery vehicles, 1,550 warheads, and 800 launchers. Russia suspended its participation in February 2023, citing the United States' 'destruction of the legal basis for arms control and security' due to NATO's military deployment against Russia. However, Russia has consistently stated its intention to comply with the treaty's limits during its active period.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[AlMomento.net](https://almomento.net/ve-es-buena-idea-decision-putin-prorrogar-tratado-sobre-armas/)\n\n**Russia Calls for U.S. Talks on Nuclear Weapons, Urges Future Inclusion of Britain and France - EconoTimes**\nRussia has called for direct U.S.\u2013Russia talks on reducing strategic nuclear weapons, while insisting that Britain and France eventually be included. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday that although the New START treaty is a bilateral agreement, long\u2011term European and global security requires addressing the arsenals of all major powers. He noted that Russia and the United States hold the world\u2019s largest stockpiles, while Britain and France \u2013 never parties to New START \u2013 maintain roughly 250\u2013300 warheads each. Peskov warned that ignoring those European arsenals would undermine long\u2011term security. President Vladimir Putin had earlier proposed that Russia and the U.S. voluntarily maintain the New START limits for one year after its 2026 expiration, provided Washington agreed. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the proposal as 'pretty good,' but said the decision rests with President Donald Trump. Trump has previously expressed interest in expanding arms\u2011control talks to include China. New START, signed in 2010 by Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limits each side to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 700 delivery vehicles. The treaty was extended in 2021 under Joe Biden but suspended by Russia in 2023 amid tensions over the war in Ukraine, though Moscow says it still observes the limits. The future of arms control remains uncertain as Ukraine pushes for harsher sanctions on Moscow and Washington weighs whether to pursue bilateral or expanded talks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[EconoTimes](https://econotimes.com/Russia-Calls-for-US-Talks-on-Nuclear-Weapons-Urges-Future-Inclusion-of-Britain-and-France-1721811)\n\n**Putin Proposes Temporary Extension of Strategic Weapons Reduction Treaty with Trump**\nOn September 22\u202f2025, Russian President Vladimir\u202fPutin announced at a Security Council meeting that he is ready to extend the New\u202fSTART treaty for an additional year, but only if U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump agrees to do the same (Reuters).

'Donald Trump afirmou que pretende abrir negocia\u00e7\u00f5es de desnucleariza\u00e7\u00e3o com R\u00fassia e China em meio \u00e0 aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o do fim do New START, o \u00faltimo tratado de controle de armas entre Washington e Moscou, que expira em fevereiro de 2026,' the article reports. He said he has already discussed the issue with President Vladimir\u202fPutin and believes Chinese President Xi\u202fJinping will agree to engage. 'O presidente dos Estados Unidos disse j\u00e1 ter tratado do tema com Vladimir Putin e afirmou acreditar que Xi Jinping aceitar\u00e1 se engajar nas conversas,' the piece notes. Trump also hinted at a meeting with North Korean leader Kim\u202fJong\u202fUn. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits the strategic arsenals of the United States and Russia. 'O New START, assinado em 2010, limita os arsenais estrat\u00e9gicos dos EUA e da R\u00fassia,' the article states. Moscow has warned that renewal is unlikely, and previous attempts to involve China failed because Beijing claims its nuclear stockpile is far smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia. In 2024, the Biden administration sought to open a similar dialogue but paused it after China suspended meetings in protest of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Trump\u2019s re\u2011emphasis on nuclear control comes amid a diplomatic impasse and growing rivalry among the U.S., Russia, China and North Korea, raising concerns that the collapse of New START could spark a new arms race in an already unstable geopolitical environment.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 08:43 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2025/08/trump-quer-falar-china-e-russia-sobre-desnuclearizacao.shtml)\n\n**Trump Calls on Russia and China for Nuclear Disarmament Talks**\nPresident Donald\u202fTrump has urged Russia and China to resume nuclear\u2011disarmament talks, saying it is \"very important\" to achieve denuclearization.

    "summary": "Forecasters across a range of international relations, strategic, arms control, and diplomatic perspectives are moderately divided but generally converge on the following assessment for whether at least two of the US, Russia, or China will mutually agree to decrease their nuclear stockpiles before 2026 via a formal, signed treaty:\n\nAll experts agree that a US-Russia bilateral extension of New START (likely a one-year extension) is the only plausible path to a YES resolution, as China has repeatedly and categorically refused to join mutual reduction agreements. There is consensus that the likelihood of any deal involving China is essentially zero.\n\nSeveral factors moderately increase the probability: both President Trump and President Putin have made unusually direct and positive public statements about supporting an extension, which creates political space for a rapid agreement. The approaching expiration of New START creates further impetus for a quick, minimalist, and symbolic deal. Historical precedent exists for last-minute extensions between the US and Russia, though broader new arms control treaties are rare and slow to negotiate.\n\nConversely, multiple factors decrease the probability: the base rate for new or extended treaties in such a compressed timeframe is low, especially amid ongoing deep US-Russia mistrust, Russia\u2019s suspension of participation in New START, the Ukraine war, and general geopolitical tensions. Bureaucratic and domestic political hurdles remain, as do questions about verification, and there is no evidence that formal negotiations or document drafting have yet begun.\n\nIn scenario terms, YES would require Trump and Putin to quickly formalize and sign a one-year extension (or similar minimalist treaty), without waiting for ratification. NO would prevail if talks stall over lingering disputes, domestic obstacles, or simple inertia.\n\nProbabilities given by experts are dispersed: the lowest cluster (around 32\u201340%) reflects status quo inertia and high barriers to quick agreement, even with recent positive signals. A middle cluster (around 62\u201368%) reflects optimism grounded in the leadership\u2019s open signaling, low bar for resolution (signature only), and past precedent for brinkmanship ending in agreements. A higher estimate of 75% is given by one forecaster emphasizing the strategic rationality and recent history of last-minute deals. No experts consider either outcome certain; the majority believe NO is somewhat more likely, but at least 3\u20134 experts consider the odds above 50% given the current diplomatic environment.\n\nIn summary: All forecasters view a US-Russia extension as plausible and a deal with China as unrealistic. The primary disagreement is how much the combination of positive leader signaling, compressed timeline, and real-world friction alters the historic base rate of last-minute arms control agreements. The median and mean forecast cluster between 35% and 65%, with the balance slightly favoring a NO outcome, but with a real and notable chance of a signed US-Russia extension before the 2026 deadline.",
