Macron\u2019s own incentives, public opposition, and the lack of guarantee that a new election would bring a governable majority all weigh heavily against a repeat dissolution. Nonetheless, the very real risk that no government can survive long enough to pass a 2026 budget, especially as evidenced by the no-confidence threats against Lecornu, means that a last-resort dissolution cannot be ruled out.

However, the political cost is high: the last dissolution backfired, Macron\u2019s approval ratings are at record lows, and both elite and public opinion are against another snap election. Dissolution would likely further fragment the Assembly or empower the extremes, not solve the deadlock. Nevertheless, the government is highly unstable: five PMs in two years, recurrent no-confidence votes, and no majority for essential budget legislation. If the Assembly becomes completely unworkable and a financial or social crisis escalates, Macron could see dissolution as the lesser evil. Given the constitutional, historical, and political constraints, but acknowledging the unprecedented instability and external pressures, the odds of Macron calling another snap election before 2026 are above the historical base rate, but still significantly below 50%.

The legal mechanism for dissolution is now available, and if no government can secure a budget or persist through confidence votes, Macron could be compelled by circumstances to act, regardless of his preferences.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nFollowing the 2024 EU Parliament elections, France saw the rise of the right wing National Rally. This made French president Emmanuel Macron call early legislative elections and dissolution of the National Assembly, in response. \n\nFollowing the 2024 french legislative elections, the National Assembly has been mostly split three-ways, between the big tent, left wing grouping [New Popular Front with 180 seats; the centrist Ensemble with 159 seats; and the aforementioned National rally with 142 seats. None of the above gaining a majority in the 577 seat parliament](https://www.resultats-elections.interieur.gouv.fr/legislatives2024/ensemble_geographique/index.html). Some feel that this polarized parliament could lead to government deadlock, with any formed government potentially having a hard time surviving a motion of no confidence against it. This may potentially lead to Macron calling another snap election before the next scheduled legislative election, to ease the potential deadlock, which the french constitution only allow after a year since the previous legislative election.\n\nSee also from Le Monde: [Snap elections in France: How it works, precedents, and consequences](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/article/2024/06/10/snap-elections-in-france-how-it-works-precedents-and-consequences_6674391_8.html)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":26114,\"question_id\":26114}}`",

The 75,000\u2011registered electorate turned out at just 23\u202f% (about 17,250 voters), the lowest turnout in recent French elections. Barnier, who had been out of office for ten months, secured the 50th seat in the LR group and the sole LR seat in Paris, where the 18 constituencies are split between left\u2011wing parties and supporters of President Macron. He said, 'In the place where I find myself now, loyal and free within my political family, I will remain committed to strengthening collaboration with all responsible political formations. Time is of the essence.' Bredin, a former minister, lamented the low participation, saying, 'The very low participation \u2013 less than a quarter of those registered voted \u2013 deeply saddens me. We are witnessing a real crisis of democracy.' Bruno Retailleau, LR president, welcomed the result, noting that the left had 'retreated by more than six points' compared to the 2024 legislative elections.

Macron\u2019s decision is described as a \"political error\" that the president will later admit, because it broke the usual pattern in which the president\u2019s party holds a relative majority after the legislative elections.  The 2024 early elections produced three blocs: the left\u2011wing New Popular Front (NFP) with 182 deputies, the centre\u2011right coalition (Renaissance, Horizons, Modem, Les R\u00e9publicains) and the RN.  None of the blocs achieved the 289\u2011deputy majority required for an absolute majority in the 577\u2011seat chamber, but the NFP held a relative majority.\n\nMacron bypassed the democratic rule that the prime minister (PM) should come from the majority bloc and appointed Michel\u202fBarnier, a former minister from Les R\u00e9publicains, in September\u202f2024.  Barnier\u2019s appointment was justified by the desire to consolidate the centre\u2011right coalition and his reputation as a skilled negotiator, especially after his role in the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.  The article quotes Barnier\u2019s willingness to \"consider\" the RN and notes that the RN had been pursuing a strategy of legitimacy by presenting itself as a responsible party.\n\nBarnier\u2019s tenure was short\u2011lived.  He was toppled by a vote of no confidence in December\u202f2024, becoming the second PM in the Fifth Republic to be removed in this way after Georges\u202fPompidou.  Macron then appointed Fran\u00e7ois\u202fBayrou, leader of the Democratic Movement (Modem), as PM.  Bayrou\u2019s appointment was seen as a continuation of Macron\u2019s politics, and the article describes his attempt to \"overcome the Himalaya\" of political divisions.  Bayrou survived a no\u2011confidence motion in January\u202f2025 thanks to the Socialist Party (PS), but was again ousted in September\u202f2025 over a budget dispute that included the removal of two public holidays and a proposed 44\u202fbillion\u2011euro savings plan, while the left demanded only 22\u202fbillion euros.\n\nThe article concludes that the appointment of S\u00e9bastien\u202fLecornu as Bayrou\u2019s successor offers no clear prospects.  Lecornu, a long\u2011time minister, may face the same fate as his predecessors, potentially leading to another dissolution of the Assembly and a possible co\u2011habitation, the first since 1997.  The piece uses a negative tone, describing the events as \"political mistakes\" and \"suicide politique\", and emphasizes the instability and lack of clear direction.\n\nKey metrics cited: 577 total deputies, 289 required for an absolute majority, 182 deputies for the NFP, 44\u202fbillion euros savings in Barnier\u2019s 2025 budget, 22\u202fbillion euros proposed by the left, and a national debt exceeding 100\u202f% of GDP.

The proposals included a veto on the Zucman tax, the return of the ISF, a suspension \u2013 and even a possible abolition \u2013 of the pension reform, a tentative opening to the right on state medical aid, and vague statements on other matters such as public spending cuts and a \u201cblank year\u201d.  The Parisian press described the PM\u2019s remarks as a \u201cmain vide\u201d and \u201cmots creux\u201d.  For the Socialist Party (PS), the promised break was absent; Olivier\u202fFaure warned that the party would meet the PM next week and, if no major change occurs, will move to censure the government.  The PS feels empowered by the broad public support for its fiscal and pension proposals, while the PM\u2019s confidence rating is at a historic low and his coalition \u2013 comprising Renaissance, Modem, UDI, Horizons and Les\u202fR\u00e9publicains \u2013 remains fragile.  A new mobilisation day is scheduled for 2\u202fOctober, with the PM expected to convene a meeting with the socialists that Friday and a fourth meeting with the coalition on Monday.  The PM\u2019s strategy is to avoid after\u2011sales support, limiting himself to two written interviews and no radio or TV appearances, which has led to accusations of \u201cdure\u201d tactics.  The National Rally accuses the PM of \u201ctrying to buy time\u201d, and the RN\u2019s Jean\u2011Philippe\u202fTanguy calls for a swift dissolution.  The PM promised a government \u201cbefore the parliamentary work begins\u201d, implying a deadline of 1\u202fOctober or, more realistically, by the end of the week.  The article quotes the PM\u2019s own words: \u2018Nous rencontrerons une derni\u00e8re fois le Premier ministre la semaine prochaine \u00e0 sa demande. Nous prendrons ensuite notre d\u00e9cision : sans changement majeur d\u2019orientation, nous censurerons ce gouvernement\u2019.  It also cites a Macron\u2011supporter: \u2018Il fera des concessions au PS pendant le d\u00e9bat, ce qui permettra \u00e0 Olivier\u202fFaure d\u2019afficher des victoires dans les prochaines semaines\u2019.

Filippo wrote on X that \"you will hear all day in the media that these elections have become a victim of Russian interference\", but he argues the opposite: \"there was huge interference from Europeans\".  He cites the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, who visited Moldova and, ten days before the autumn 2024 referendum on EU accession, announced a record aid package of 1.8\u202fbillion euros.

Bayrou survived a no\u2011confidence motion in January\u202f2025 thanks to the Socialist Party (PS), but was again ousted in September\u202f2025 over a budget dispute that included the removal of two public holidays and a proposed 44\u202fbillion\u2011euro savings plan, while the left demanded only 22\u202fbillion euros.\n\nThe article concludes that the appointment of S\u00e9bastien\u202fLecornu as Bayrou\u2019s successor offers no clear prospects.  Lecornu, a long\u2011time minister, may face the same fate as his predecessors, potentially leading to another dissolution of the Assembly and a possible co\u2011habitation, the first since 1997.  The piece uses a negative tone, describing the events as \"political mistakes\" and \"suicide politique\", and emphasizes the instability and lack of clear direction.\n\nKey metrics cited: 577 total deputies, 289 required for an absolute majority, 182 deputies for the NFP, 44\u202fbillion euros savings in Barnier\u2019s 2025 budget, 22\u202fbillion euros proposed by the left, and a national debt exceeding 100\u202f% of GDP.

The opposition \u2013 including the National Rally, the Left Front and the Socialists \u2013 has mobilised, citing a lack of fiscal flexibility, no emblematic measures and no suspension of the pension reform.

The judge handed Sarkozy a five\u2011year prison term, making him the first post\u2011World\u2011War\u202fII French president to be incarcerated.  According to the court, the sentence is immediately enforceable, but the president is allowed a short period to settle his affairs; he is not permitted to avoid imprisonment pending appeal.  \"The verdict shows that no one is above the law,\" said Ludovic Friat, president of the USM, the largest union of French prosecutors and judges.  \"There will be a clear before\u2011and\u2011after to this decision,\" he added.  The article reports that 89\u202f% of sentences longer than two years are enforced before an appeal is concluded, a figure cited by Judith Allenbach, president of another judges\u2019 association.  The conviction has prompted calls for the abolition of the practice of immediately enforceable sentences.  Meanwhile, Marine Le\u202fPen, the leader of the far\u2011right National Rally, faces a separate five\u2011year political ban for alleged EU\u2011fund embezzlement, which could bar her from running in the 2027 election.  Le\u202fPen\u2019s supporters claim that right\u2011wing politicians are treated more harshly by judges, citing the acquittal of former centrist Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.  The article also notes that US President Donald Trump has described Le\u202fPen as a victim of \"lawfare\" and has sent a diplomatic delegation in her support.  French political figures are divided: conservative Senate president G\u00e9rard Larcher expressed concern over the debate on immediate enforcement, while left\u2011wing MP Manuel Bompard praised the call for honesty and rule of law.

It explains that Kurz\u2019s government faces several challenges: approving the 2026 budget, dealing with a new wave of protests, and avoiding a potential loss of confidence from opposition parties, especially the left. The piece notes that France has been politically unstable since the European elections of June\u202f2024, citing Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly and call early parliamentary elections in July\u202f2024, which produced a hung parliament with the left\u2011wing Popular Front winning 182 seats, the pro\u2011Macron \u201cEnsemble\u201d bloc 168 seats, and the far\u2011right National Rally 143 seats. The article highlights three main factors behind the crisis: (1) Macron\u2019s failure to build a \u201cthird way\u201d and his shift to liberal\u2011right policies, (2) the erosion of democratic norms through the use of Article\u202f49.3 to pass legislation without a parliamentary majority, and (3) the rise of populist forces that have pressured Macron to resign. It also details Kurz\u2019s potential difficulties: securing a majority for the 2026 budget, managing protests that began on 10 and 18\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 with about 500 arrests, and negotiating with left\u2011wing and far\u2011right parties.

B\u00e9ru, a centrist from the Democratic Movement, had taken office in December\u202f2023 and had already faced criticism for her 2026 budget plan that cut \u20ac43.8\u202fbillion in spending and aimed to bring the deficit to 4.6\u202f% of GDP. The fragmented Assembly\u2014577 seats split among the New People Front (190), Together (161) and the National Rally (123)\u2014makes it difficult for any coalition to secure a majority. Macron now faces a choice between appointing a new prime minister who can survive in this divided chamber or dissolving the Assembly and calling early elections; he has so far rejected the latter option. Opposition leaders have blamed the president for the crisis: Socialists\u2019 parliamentary leader Boris\u202fValou said, '\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u8981\u4e3a\u8fd9\u573a\u5371\u673a\u3001\u8fd9\u573a\u60e8\u8d25\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d1f\u8d23\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u603b\u7edf\u3002' The far\u2011right National Rally\u2019s Marine\u202fLe\u202fPen has called for an immediate dissolution, while the left\u2019s Jean\u2011Loup\u202fM\u00e9lenchon has urged Macron\u2019s resignation. The political deadlock coincides with social unrest: a nationwide \u2018full\u2011lockdown\u2019 protest is planned for 10\u202fSeptember, with a poll showing that two\u2011thirds of respondents support it, and a general strike on 18\u202fSeptember has been called by several unions. Economists warn that France\u2019s fiscal challenges are mounting, with debt\u2011interest payments projected to rise from \u20ac30\u202fbillion in 2020 to over \u20ac100\u202fbillion by 2030.

The vote left France in a political deadlock just before the 2027 presidential election. Political scientist Eric Monteiro said it is unclear who could form a government that would keep stability until 2027. The article explains that the parliament is divided into three ideological groups \u2013 far\u2011left, far\u2011right and a central bloc that splits into many sub\u2011factions \u2013 and that no one will want to take the premiership close to the presidential election. A poll from 8\u202fSeptember showed Emmanuel Macron\u2019s popularity at 15\u202f%, the lowest in the Fifth Republic, and the far\u2011right Rassemblement National wants a dissolution of the Assembly, while the left wants a new left\u2011wing figure. The author argues that a dissolution would give the Rassemblement National a plurality of 30\u201135\u202f% but still insufficient to govern. Potential candidates for prime minister are listed \u2013 Xavier Bertrand, Ya\u00ebl Braun\u2011Pivet, Catherine Vautrin, S\u00e9bastian Lecornu and Bruno Retailleau \u2013 and the need for consensus to pass the next budget is stressed. The piece concludes that, given the upcoming nationwide mobilisation, appointing a new prime minister on the eve of the protests would be ill\u2011timed, and that stability will likely require a broader electoral campaign and parliamentary majority.

The motion was prompted by Bayru\u2019s own initiative, who had sought the chamber\u2019s support amid a prolonged budget crisis that centred on a 44\u202fbillion\u2011euro cut plan presented in July. Bayru had been in office for only nine months, mirroring the fate of his predecessor Michel Barne, who resigned after just three months following a similar no\u2011confidence vote in December\u202f2024. The article notes that President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a new prime minister \"in the coming days\" (\"\u0432 \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0430\u0439\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043d\u0438\") and that Bayru is expected to submit his resignation to the president on 9\u202fSeptember. It further explains that France has seen four changes of government in the past two years and that Macron now faces a critical decision: appoint a seventh prime minister or call for snap elections. The political crisis began in July\u202f2024 when Macron dissolved the National Assembly and called early parliamentary elections after the far\u2011right National Rally (RN) won the European Parliament elections. The results of the French parliamentary elections were 180 seats for the left\u2011wing New Popular Front (NFP), 159 for Macron\u2019s centrist Together coalition, and 142 for the RN led by Marine Le Pen.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 11:06 AM\nSource:[\u0413\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430.uz](https://www.gazeta.uz/ru/2025/09/09/france/)\n\n**Macron and France\u2019s Fifth Republic: '\u5371'!**\nThe article reports that on 8 September 2024 the French National Assembly rejected a confidence motion against Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth B\u00e9ru, leading to her resignation and the collapse of her government.  According to the vote, 364 members opposed the motion while 194 supported it, a result that \"did not secure a majority for B\u00e9ru\u2019s administration\".  President Emmanuel\u202fMacron is now faced with appointing a new prime minister within the next few days, as the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace has \"not ruled out\" a new election but prefers a swift appointment.  The crisis is linked to B\u00e9ru\u2019s fiscal plan, which proposed a \u20ac44\u202fbillion austerity package and the elimination of two public holidays to bring the 2026 deficit down to 4.6\u202f% of GDP.  France\u2019s 2024 deficit already stands at 5.8\u202f% of GDP, above the EU limit of 3\u202f%, and the country\u2019s debt is 114\u202f% of GDP, the third\u2011highest in the euro\u2011zone.  Macron\u2019s earlier decision to hold early parliamentary elections in 2022 is cited as a key factor that \"strengthened the far\u2011right\" and \"revitalised the left\", creating a \"floating parliament\".  The article quotes opposition figures: the National Rally\u2019s Marine Le\u202fPen says the only way to break the deadlock is to hold new elections, while left\u2011wing MP Mathilde\u202fPanot declares, \"We give Macron two choices: either accept impeachment or resign. We will also end the Fifth Republic.\"  The piece notes that the French constitution allows the president to dissolve the National Assembly and that Macron has \"little leverage\" left, as the political landscape has become highly fragmented.  Analysts suggest that Macron may either appoint a centrist, a left\u2011wing veteran, or a technocrat, but each option faces significant obstacles.  The article concludes that without a clear majority, France risks another early election or a prolonged governance crisis, and that the possibility of a Sixth Republic has been raised by some politicians.\n\nEvidence: 364\u2011194 vote result; 5.8\u202f% deficit; 114\u202f% debt; quotes from Le\u202fPen and Panot; reference to B\u00e9ru\u2019s \u20ac44\u202fbillion plan; mention of Macron\u2019s 2022 early election.\n\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 10:03 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8mVfbUnpOxm)\n\n**With French Government On The Brink, Macron's Room To Maneuver Is Limited**\nThe French National Assembly is set to vote on a confidence motion for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on September\u202f8, a defeat that would deepen political instability and curtail President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s options.  Bayrou, who opened the debate with a speech that day, faces opposition from all ten parliamentary groups, with the vote expected to conclude around 7\u202fp.m. Paris time.  Macron\u2019s snap election in 2024 has left the legislature fragmented, and the country is grappling with rising debt\u2014France\u2019s deficit is close to 6\u202f% of GDP, double the Eurozone ceiling\u2014and external pressures from the Ukraine war, a potential U.S. trade war, and China\u2019s rise.  If Bayrou loses, Macron is unlikely to call another snap election or resign; instead, he will likely appoint a new, more left\u2011leaning prime minister and push a budget with moderate cuts.  Nationwide strikes may follow, and Macron will focus on foreign policy, maintaining a vocal stance on Ukraine and the Middle East while avoiding large financial commitments.  The article notes that Macron\u2019s earlier decision to call parliamentary elections after a poor European Parliament result backfired, leaving his centrist \u201cEnsemble pour la R\u00e9publique\u201d weakened and the National Assembly dominated by Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally and a coalition of left\u2011wing parties.  Bayrou\u2019s attempt to cut 0.8\u202f% of GDP from the deficit\u2014already near 6\u202f%\u2014failed, and markets remain jittery.  Le Pen, barred from office after a conviction for EU fund misuse, is reportedly seeking early elections to challenge the Constitutional Council\u2019s ruling, which could allow her to run again in 2027.  The piece warns that a social\u2011media\u2011driven protest movement could either fizzle or drag on, risking an economic crisis.  Should Macron survive, he will return to the international stage, pursuing European leadership, a French seat at future Ukraine negotiations, and a \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism to re\u2011impose UN sanctions on Iran, while continuing to push for a Paris\u2011recognised Palestine at the UN General Assembly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 03:46 PM\nSource:[rferl.org](https://www.rferl.org/a/france-bayrou-confidence-vote-macron-political-crisis/33524817.html)\n\n**Could the French Government Fall Next Monday? Macron\u2019s Options**\nThe article examines the high probability that the French government, led by Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, will fall on Monday 8\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 after a confidence motion in the National Assembly. The opposition\u2014comprising the National Rally (RN) of Marine Le\u202fPen, the radical left France Insumisa (LFI), the Greens, the Communists and the Socialist Party\u2014has announced it will vote against Bayrou. A motion requires 289 of the 577 seats; the article notes that the arithmetic suggests the threshold is likely to be reached given widespread rejection of Bayrou\u2019s austerity plan, which proposes \u20ac44\u202fbillion in cuts and the elimination of two national holidays. If the motion passes, Bayrou and his cabinet must resign, and President Emmanuel Macron would need to appoint a new prime minister or, less likely, call early elections. The fragmented parliament, with no single bloc holding an absolute majority, would make forming a stable government difficult, potentially prolonging political uncertainty. The article also outlines potential economic consequences: the 2025 budget, which includes \u20ac44\u202fbillion cuts to meet EU deficit targets\u2014reducing the public deficit from 6\u202f% to 3\u202f% of GDP\u2014could be stalled, risking EU sanctions, market pressure and higher borrowing costs. Social unrest could intensify if austerity measures remain unchanged. The article notes that a snap election is unlikely because the constitution forbids elections before July\u202f2025, and polls suggest RN might gain ground while the Macronist Ensemble loses seats. The collapse would further weaken Macron\u2019s authority, whose term ends in 2027, and could empower far\u2011right forces ahead of the presidential election.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 03:45 AM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/internacional/puede-caer-gobierno-francia-proximo-lunes-estas-son-opciones-macron-15349161)\n\n**Voluntary Confinement Against Macron**\nAfter the June 2024 European Parliament elections, the National Rally (RN) topped the list, giving the left\u2011leaning New Popular Front a majority of almost 200 seats in the lower house, while the 125 RN deputies remain crucial for passing controversial laws and rejecting no\u2011confidence motions. The article criticises President Emmanuel Macron and his liberal prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou for failing to deliver promised reforms, citing Bayrou's \u20ac43.8\u202fbillion savings plan aimed at reducing the public deficit to 4.6\u202f% by 2026. It notes that Bayrou has not cut spending on international cooperation, party privileges, or bureaucracy. By September, the plan will face opposition from RN's Jordan Bardella and Jean\u2011Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who are preparing another no\u2011confidence motion that could succeed only with right\u2011wing support. The piece also describes a proposed voluntary lockdown starting 10\u202fSeptember, labelled 'Bloquons tout!', calling for school closures, travel bans, and a general strike. The author portrays the state as policing dissent, highlights the left's role as a safety valve, and laments the rise of far\u2011left agitators. The tone is strongly critical of Macron and supportive of leftist opposition, with frequent use of loaded language and rhetorical exaggeration. Evidence: the article states the RN topped the list and the New Popular Front holds almost 200 seats; it quotes 'El programa de reformas radicales que prometi\u00f3 aplicar Macron cuando gan\u00f3 las primeras elecciones presidenciales, en 2017, vuelve a avanzar a trancas y barrancas'; it cites the \u20ac43.8\u202fbillion savings plan (El plan de ahorro de 43.800 millones de euros) and the 4.6\u202f% deficit target; it mentions the 125 RN deputies; it refers to the proposed lockdown 'Bloquons tout!' and the date 10\u202fSeptember.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 04:12 PM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/opinion/confinamiento-voluntario-contra-macron-15283929)\n\n**Marine Le Pen Calls for Preparation for Possible Snap Elections in France**\nMarine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally party, has called on her supporters to prepare for possible snap parliamentary elections in France.

Le Pen emphasized the need to be prepared for any uncertainty and announced that the deadline for waiting for the possible dissolution of parliament is July 7. She also noted that Macron's supporters are in a difficult situation, unable to continue existing in the face of internal conflict, which may prompt the president to dissolve parliament. Le Pen emphasized: 'His statement 'I do not want dissolution' does not guarantee that it will not happen'. Additionally, she highlighted the need for right-wing parties to actively prepare for municipal elections scheduled for the first half of 2026. In July 2024, Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly, initiating snap elections. As a result, the left-wing block won the majority of seats, surpassing the 'Together for the Republic' coalition, which secured 168 seats. The National Rally party, together with Republicans, took third place, winning 143 seats. Due to this, none of the political forces were able to form a majority government. As a result, France experienced a record four prime ministers in 2024.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 28, 2025 02:36 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/marin-le-pen-prizvala-gotovitsya-k-vozmozhnym-vyboram-vo-francii-652343.html)\n\n**France between the 2024 Crisis and a New Specter: The Nightmare of Early Elections**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly and hold early elections has led to a constitutional crisis and a fragmented parliament. The elections resulted in a parliament divided into three blocs: the far-right, the center, and the traditional right, and the left. As a result, Macron no longer has a majority to pass laws, and his government has lost its effective power. The first prime minister after the dissolution, Michel Barnier, failed to gain the confidence of the parliament and resigned in December 2024, to be replaced by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who is also struggling with a similar fragility and a threat of a vote of no confidence at the start of the next parliamentary session. A survey conducted by the Odysseus Institute for Le Figaro found that the majority of the French people view this decision negatively and do not want to repeat it before the 2027 legislative elections. According to the survey, 66% of the French people see this decision as 'a bad decision', despite a large number of them supporting it when it was announced in June 2024. The survey also found that 61% of the French people believe that the 'National Rally' party is the only one that has benefited from this election, while the other parties are seen as having been weakened. More than two-thirds of the French people (67%) believe that the President and the government have lost their political power due to this decision. In general, 62% of the French people believe that dissolving the National Assembly has had negative consequences for the country as a whole, leading 62% of them to reject any new dissolution before the next presidential election, reflecting a loss of trust in the executive's decisions and an increasing feeling that the political crisis has worsened rather than been resolved.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 07, 2025 02:24 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/france-macron-elections-parliamentf)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the probability of French President Emmanuel Macron calling another snap legislative election before January 1, 2026, is considered low but not negligible. Experts converge on several key points: constitutionally, Macron could only dissolve the National Assembly again from July 2025, which leaves a narrow window before the question closes; historically, repeated dissolutions within a single presidential term are extremely rare in the Fifth Republic; the last dissolution in July 2024 was widely seen as a strategic mistake, leading to strong public, elite, and political opposition to another snap election. The status quo scenario\u2014Macron muddling through with technocratic or minority governments, despite persistent instability, five prime ministers in under two years, budget crises, and protests\u2014is universally judged to be the most likely. However, the extreme and ongoing parliamentary deadlock, social unrest, government collapse, and the threat of economic or EU crises mean that a new dissolution remains plausible in a total impasse, especially if no government can form or pass critical legislation. Nevertheless, the dominant factors\u2014public opposition, risk to Macron\u2019s already weak legitimacy, high political and reputational costs, and the historical base rate\u2014push the odds of a snap election well below even chances, generally in the 10\u201332% range. Most experts cluster their probabilities between 18\u201332%, with some as low as 10% and only a few at or just over 27%. In summary, while instability is severe, institutional and political disincentives make a new dissolution before 2026 possible but quite unlikely; muddling through, for now, remains the default scenario.",
