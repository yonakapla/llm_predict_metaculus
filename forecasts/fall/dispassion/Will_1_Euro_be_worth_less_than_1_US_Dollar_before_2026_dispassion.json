On Tuesday, the pair may continue its weak phase around the 1.16 level, but a move above 1.17 would signal a resumption of recovery. A broader range of 1.1510 to 1.1780 is projected for the week, with the pair facing resistance from the 20-day and 50-day moving averages.

The dollar index, tracking the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.2% to 98.342, heading for a weekly drop of 0.3%. Market participants increasingly believe the Fed will follow last year\u2019s rate cut with additional easing, citing weakening economic momentum in the U.S., including stress in the labor market as highlighted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the 'Beige Book' indicating a modest loss of economic momentum over the past eight weeks. According to ING analysts, the Beige Book suggests the Fed has sufficient evidence to cut rates at its October 28\u201329 meeting, even amid a government shutdown that has paused official data releases. Markets now anticipate a 25-basis-point rate cut in October, another in December, and three more cuts in 2025. The Fed previously cut rates for the first time since December 2022, lowering the federal funds target range to 4.0%-4.25%. Traders are also watching the upcoming U.S.-China trade summit at APEC in South Korea, with concerns that China\u2019s proposed export restrictions on rare earth metals may be a strategic bargaining tool or a genuine threat to global supply chains, particularly in semiconductors. The euro rose to a weekly high of 1.1659 against the dollar, supported by political stability in France after Prime Minister Gabriel Attal\u2019s government survived two no-confidence votes following a delay in pension reform, a key demand of the Socialist Party. ING noted that while this is positive for the euro and French government bonds in the short term, it complicates long-term fiscal consolidation. The bank maintains its year-end forecast for EUR/USD at 1.20. GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3436 after U.K. data showed GDP grew 0.1% in August, reversing a flat reading in July. USD/JPY dipped slightly to 151.06 amid growing doubts over Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s ability to form a stable government, despite being elected leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, as opposition parties considered backing alternative candidates and a key coalition partner withdrew. USD/CNY fell to 7.1253 as the Chinese yuan stabilized after a series of strong central bank fixes, while U.S. President Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. AUD/USD dropped 0.1% to 0.6503 following weak September labor market data, with employment growth missing expectations and unemployment unexpectedly rising to a four-year high; August data were also revised downward, signaling a sharper labor market slowdown than previously thought. These figures increased expectations of a Reserve Bank of Australia rate cut in early November to prevent further job losses.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/forex-news/article-2951199)\n\n**FXNEWS24 |Sentiment and Hard Data Continue to Diverge | UK Forex Reviews**\nEUR/USD analysis from FXNEWS24 highlights a growing divergence between sentiment data and hard economic data, signaling challenges ahead for Europe. While sentiment data improved in early 2024, mirroring late 2023 trends, inflation expectations and perceptions of future price pressures rose. However, this optimism contrasts sharply with deteriorating hard data, particularly in manufacturing: Germany\u2019s and the broader EU\u2019s manufacturing PMI figures show contraction. External pressures remain strong, with limited improvement in China despite government stimulus. The European unemployment rate fell slightly from 6.5% to 6.4%, indicating labor market resilience amid industrial decline. On the technical front, EUR/USD remains in a long-term uptrend (higher highs and higher lows), but recent price action suggests a short-term decline, marked by a bearish flag formation. The bearish flag is holding at a key support zone defined by Fibonacci levels: the 50% retracement of the 2021\u20132022 decline and the 61.8% retracement of the 2023 decline. Support is identified at 1.0831, with resistance at 1.0960 and then 1.1017. The upcoming US CPI release on Thursday is expected to increase volatility, with any upside surprise potentially fueling a short-term bearish continuation. EUR/USD price movements are closely correlated with US equities, reflecting a risk-on/risk-off dynamic, as interest rate expectations between the US and Eurozone remain closely aligned. According to Richard Snow of DailyFX, market sentiment and geopolitical factors may play a larger role in future price action than interest rate differentials.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2024 04:19 PM\nSource:[fxnews24.co.uk](https://fxnews24.co.uk/forex/sentiment-and-hard-data-continue-to-diverge/)\n\n**EUR/USD Chart Analysis & Projections for the New Week #43 | Investing.com**\nThe EUR/USD currency pair closed the previous week at 1.1650, marking a retreat after briefly exceeding the 1.17 resistance level.

The euro was set at \u20bd94.5835, and the Chinese yuan at \u20bd11.3435. This represents a rise of \u20bd1.8995 for the dollar, \u20bd2.5001 for the euro, and \u20bd0.2812 for the yuan compared to the previous day. These official rates are used for calculations on the Moscow Exchange's derivatives market, including futures contracts such as USDRUBF, EURRUBF, and CNY/RUB. On October 17, the ruble weakened against foreign currencies, with the CNY/RUB rate on the Moscow Exchange rising 2.07% to \u20bd11.429 by 16:54 MSK. The perpetual futures contracts for the dollar (USDRUBF) and euro (EURRUBF) surged 3.44% and 3.8%, respectively, reaching \u20bd81.8 and \u20bd95.6. Experts including Bogdan Zvarich from PSB and Alexey Mikhayev from VTB My Investments believe the recent ruble strengthening was temporary, driven by one-time factors, and that the currency is likely to weaken due to declining oil prices, expected rate cuts, and inflationary pressures. Mikhayev forecasts the dollar could reach \u20bd85 by the end of 2025, with CNY/RUB reaching \u20bd12. MKB Investments anticipates the dollar may approach \u20bd105 by year-end, citing inflationary pressures, tight monetary policy, and declining oil revenues as key drivers of ruble depreciation through 2026. The CNY/RUB pair is expected to range between \u20bd11\u201311.5 in the near term, potentially moving toward the upper end and reaching \u20bd12 by year-end.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 02:39 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/quote/news/article/68f236fb9a7947167b2041be)\n\n**Updated Foreign Exchange Rates: Dollar, Euro, and Sterling Prices on October 17, 2025**\nOn October 17, 2025, the Turkish Lira (TL) exchange rates showed increases for major currencies.

The euro (EUR) closed at 49.0105 TL, with a daily high of 49.0313 TL and a low of 48.7453 TL. The downward trend in the U.S. dollar index continued due to concerns about the U.S. economy and expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will maintain its interest rate cuts. Ongoing government shutdowns in the U.S. and concerns over the banking sector are influencing asset prices. Analysts noted that domestic market focus will center on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey's (TCMB) survey of market participants and short-term external debt statistics, while international attention will remain on inflation data from the Eurozone.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 09:42 AM\nSource:[Yeni \u015eafak](https://www.yenisafak.com/foto-galeri/ozgun/guncel-canli-doviz-kuru-doviz-fiyatlari-artti-mi-dolar-tl-euro-tl-sterlin-tl-ne-kadar-iste-17-ekim-cuma-guncel-dolar-euro-ve-sterlin-fiyatlari-4759348)\n\n**Euro Strengthens Against Dollar Amid US Rate Cut Expectations and Political Stability in France**\nThe euro strengthened against the US dollar, rising to a daily high of 1.1728 USD, before settling slightly lower at 1.17 USD, still above the previous day's level.

These figures increased expectations of a Reserve Bank of Australia rate cut in early November to prevent further job losses.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/forex-news/article-2951199)\n\n**Rupee Edges Higher As RBI Holds Policy Rates, Dollar Weakens On Shutdown | Investing.com India**\nThe Indian rupee edged higher against the U.S. dollar following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to hold its key repo rate at 5.50% during its October 2025 meeting, in line with market expectations. The dollar weakened broadly amid the third U.S. government shutdown under President Trump, which occurred after lawmakers failed to agree on a temporary funding deal. The USDINR trading range for the day was 88.65\u201389.03. The euro declined as caution persisted post-shutdown, with the HCOB Eurozone Manufacturing PMI falling to 49.8 in September 2025 from a three-year high of 50.7 in August, signaling contraction. The ECB is expected to keep interest rates steady through year-end due to renewed inflationary pressures in Germany, France, and Spain. The British pound rose on dollar weakness, with GBPINR trading between 119.35 and 119.99. The UK Nationwide House Price Index rose 2.2% year-on-year in September 2025, up from 2.1% in August. Catherine Mann warned of sticky inflation, with firms embedding higher labor costs into prices. The Japanese yen steadied, supported by improved sentiment among large manufacturers in Q3 2025\u2014the strongest since Q4 2024\u2014and a revised S&P Global Japan Manufacturing PMI of 48.5 (from 48.4), with the Bank of Japan citing the survey as a key indicator for future rate hikes.

The yen briefly touched 1\u202fUSD\u202f=\u202f148.91\u202fJPY, the lowest level in about three weeks, before settling back. The decline was driven by a rise in U.S. long\u2011term rates, which widened the U.S.\u2013Japan interest\u2011rate spread and prompted yen selling and dollar buying.

The article notes that the market still prices in the risk of a further cut, but this could be offset if France\u2019s fiscal situation improves. Conversely, a weakening U.S. economy is expected to prompt further U.S. rate cuts, making the dollar less attractive. In the past week, the euro reached a new yearly high of 1.1918. For a sustainable breakout toward the 1.2349 target, the euro would need to close above 1.1939. A retracement to the 50\u2011day moving average at 1.1666 could trigger a reversal, and a decline below 1.1201 would significantly increase the probability of a drop.

ING calculates a short\u2011term fair value of roughly 1.1850 based on yield spreads and recommends buying on any renewed dips toward 1.17.  The bank maintains a longer\u2011term target of at least 1.20.  The Fed\u2019s policy meeting confirmed a consensus expectation of two more cuts this year and one in 2026, while markets anticipate five cuts by the end of 2026.

Antonio Cesarano, chief global strategist at Intermonte, analyzed the current scenario and answered some key questions. The depreciation of the dollar is due in part to the deterioration of the US macroeconomic conditions compared to those of Europe, but also to the loss of credibility of the US administration due to Trump's aggressive and unpredictable trade policies. Another possible explanation is the 'Accordo del Plaza bis' or 'Mar-A-Lago accord', a pact with Asian countries that involves a discount on tariffs in exchange for keeping their currencies weak, especially the yuan. Market operators have reacted to the trend by increasing their hedges against the risk of dollar depreciation. There are similarities with the dollar's behavior in Trump's first term, which started in 2017. The euro/USD exchange rate is following the same trend as in 2017, starting from similar values around 1.04 at the end of 2016 and 2024. According to Cesarano, the dollar could reach 1.20/1.2175 by the end of the year, emulating the 2017 trend, but in a more accelerated form. This would depend on the conclusion of some trade negotiations, which may include the dollar, and the progressive increase in expectations of interest rate cuts by the Fed. An overshooting could temporarily reach the 2021 highs, around 1.2350. If...we go beyond the end of 2025, it is possible to think that the acute phase of the tariffs will come to an end and Trump will focus on the mid-term elections campaign in November 2026, leading to a de-escalation and a reduction in the loss of credibility caused by the Liberation Day announcement.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 01:59 PM\nSource:[borse.it](https://www.borse.it/articolo/ultime-notizie/euro-dollaro-le-prospettive-in-7-domande-chiave-la-view-di-intermonte)\n\n**US Dollar Falls to Almost Lowest Level in 2022 Due to Trump's Spending Bill and Tariff Deadline**\nThe US dollar fell to almost its lowest level in 2022 due to the influence of US President Donald Trump's spending bill and the approaching deadline for tariffs. According to Reuters, the euro fell by 0.3% to $1.1774, but was close to its maximum in September 2021, while the pound fell by 0.15% to $1.3722 after reaching its maximum in three and a half years. The dollar rose by 0.3% against the Japanese yen and reached a record high of 143.8. The dollar index, which measures the value of the currency relative to six major currencies, rose slightly to 96.74, but was close to its three-year low. This year, the US dollar has been influenced by many factors, and the first half of the year has been the worst for it since the era of floating exchange rates began in the early 1970s. The National Bank of Ukraine set the official exchange rate of the dollar to the hryvnia at 41.82 UAH/USD and the euro at 49.41 UAH/EUR, setting a new record. In Ukrainian exchange offices, the average exchange rate of the dollar is 41.70 UAH/USD, and it can be sold for 41.64 UAH.

While sentiment data improved in early 2024, mirroring late 2023 trends, inflation expectations and perceptions of future price pressures rose. However, this optimism contrasts sharply with deteriorating hard data, particularly in manufacturing: Germany\u2019s and the broader EU\u2019s manufacturing PMI figures show contraction. External pressures remain strong, with limited improvement in China despite government stimulus. The European unemployment rate fell slightly from 6.5% to 6.4%, indicating labor market resilience amid industrial decline. On the technical front, EUR/USD remains in a long-term uptrend (higher highs and higher lows), but recent price action suggests a short-term decline, marked by a bearish flag formation. The bearish flag is holding at a key support zone defined by Fibonacci levels: the 50% retracement of the 2021\u20132022 decline and the 61.8% retracement of the 2023 decline. Support is identified at 1.0831, with resistance at 1.0960 and then 1.1017. The upcoming US CPI release on Thursday is expected to increase volatility, with any upside surprise potentially fueling a short-term bearish continuation. EUR/USD price movements are closely correlated with US equities, reflecting a risk-on/risk-off dynamic, as interest rate expectations between the US and Eurozone remain closely aligned. According to Richard Snow of DailyFX, market sentiment and geopolitical factors may play a larger role in future price action than interest rate differentials.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2024 04:19 PM\nSource:[fxnews24.co.uk](https://fxnews24.co.uk/forex/sentiment-and-hard-data-continue-to-diverge/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts converge on the view that the probability of EUR/USD falling below 1.0000 before January 2026 is very low but not zero, with assigned probabilities ranging from 2% to 8%. Technical, fundamental, and policy analyses all report the current exchange rate in the 1.16\u20131.17 range\u2014well above parity\u2014and highlight strong technical support and a lack of significant negative sentiment or positioning that would catalyze a decline of sufficient scale (15%+ in 2.5 months). \n\nBase rates are emphasized: breaches below parity are historically rare and, outside of unique crisis periods (e.g., energy shock and Fed tightening in 2022), tend to be brief and quickly reversed. Macro fundamentals\u2014namely the expectation of further Fed rate cuts and ECB stability\u2014support euro strength or at least prevent severe weakness, echoed in major bank forecasts (ING, RBC) projecting year-end rates of 1.18\u20131.24. Eurozone political stability has improved, and neither bloc appears at credible risk of acute crisis as of late October 2025.\n\nThe only scenarios considered likely to cause a 'Yes' outcome involve sudden, severe exogenous shocks: an abrupt Eurozone banking or sovereign crisis, drastic escalation of geopolitical conflict, or an unexpected US data shock that forces a hawkish Fed shift. Even then, experts stress that any sub-parity print would likely be short-lived\u2014a flash crash rather than a sustained regime shift.\n\nIn sum, the consensus is that all macroeconomic, policy, and technical signals point toward continued resilience above parity. The probability of a sub-1.0000 EUR/USD before 2026 is assessed as low single digits (most commonly 7%), justified only by the irreducible risk of black swan events in global markets.",
