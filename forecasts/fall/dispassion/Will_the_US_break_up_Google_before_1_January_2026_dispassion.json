The current remedy phase in the ad tech case is wrapping up, but legal experts and media uniformly expect a decision in 2026, after the resolution deadline. Even in the unlikely event of a breakup order in late 2025, Google would appeal, which by standard practice would stay implementation until appeal resolution\u2014almost certainly after January 2026. Furthermore, the only recent antitrust case (search monopoly) resulted in behavioral and data-sharing remedies, not breakups, and the judge in the ad tech case has explicitly referenced that precedent. The regulatory environment is hostile, but the procedural and bureaucratic hurdles make a pre-2026 completed breakup extremely unlikely.

This perspective is well-grounded in how complex antitrust remedies have historically played out, and it is reinforced by the tendency of US courts to avoid structural remedies in favor of incremental or behavioral changes.

Furthermore, the answer could be strengthened by linking interest group activity directly to the expected length and complexity of appeals and compliance, which are the key drivers of outcome probability on this very tight timeframe. The forecast's core conclusion is sound, but its reasoning would be more robust with greater focus on these procedural certainties."

This is a key point that is sometimes underappreciated outside of legal circles; the US appellate process is designed to prevent irreversible remedies before appellate review, especially when the remedy is as disruptive as a forced divestiture. The forecaster also correctly notes that there is no evidence of voluntary compliance or extraordinary judicial acceleration, and that the only plausible Yes scenario would require a series of events\u2014immediate order, no stay, and rapid compliance\u2014that are vanishingly rare.

The analysis skillfully integrates recent judicial skepticism (notably Judge Mehta\u2019s decision) and the preference for behavioral remedies, which are critical factors in US antitrust practice.

The forecaster correctly bridges institutional theory with procedural realities, highlighting that even a dramatic regulatory push is constrained by legal process, appeals, and cross-agency negotiation\u2014each introducing delays incompatible with a completed breakup by January 1, 2026.

They also correctly highlight that structural remedies are generally reserved as contingencies after behavioral approaches fail, a point deeply aligned with both contestable markets theory and modern antitrust jurisprudence. The acknowledgment that a 'Yes' scenario is theoretically possible but would require a chain of improbable, unprecedented events (immediate, unappealable breakup order and Google\u2019s voluntary compliance) is an important nuance.

The explicit attention to the logistical and legal timescales needed for a complex divestiture is well supported by both real-world precedent and the procedural realities of federal court practice. By highlighting the status quo outcome of incremental, behavior-oriented remedies, they reinforce why base rates and institutional inertia should dominate the forecast. This approach is fully consistent with Interest Group Theory, which also predicts that powerful incumbents use both legal and political means to delay or dilute regulatory threats. Thus, the forecast\u2019s extremely low probability is well justified and methodologically sound."

By citing both the base rate and the explicit signals from Judge Brinkema and recent parallel cases (such as Judge Mehta\u2019s decision), the forecast is methodologically rigorous. The probability is correctly set above zero to acknowledge the remote possibility of an unprecedented court order and rapid compliance, but the logic persuasively conveys why that scenario is vanishingly rare.

[In October 2024, the DOJ said in a court filing that it might seek to have Google\u2019s core businesses broken up.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/09/tech/us-government-considers-a-breakup-of-google/index.html) Lawmakers and advocacy groups argue that a breakup\u2014splitting Google into separate entities for its search, advertising, and other business arms\u2014might be the only effective way to restore competition in the digital market.\n\nWhile Google has defended itself by asserting that its products benefit consumers and enhance competition, the company faces significant obstacles ahead. Its legal battles are likely to drag on for years, and the political climate increasingly favors stricter tech regulations. [Moreover, rising public concerns about privacy, misinformation, and tech monopolies add pressure on the government to take decisive action.](https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/antitrust-action-against-google-may-transform-the-internet/) Although a breakup remains uncertain, the outcome of Google\u2019s ongoing legal challenges could reshape the technology landscape and set a precedent for regulating other tech giants.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":29501,\"question_id\":29363}}`",

The trial, focused on 'remedy' and lasting two weeks, involves the Department of Justice (DOJ) arguing that Google's practices are anticompetitive and embedded in complex algorithms, while Google's legal team, led by Karen Dunn, claims the proposed remedies are imprudent and radical, potentially dismantling the company's ad infrastructure. The DOJ insists that breaking up Google's ad tech is the most effective way to restore market fairness, while Google maintains that its 'Ad Manager' system has already been reformed with greater transparency and pricing options. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden, threatens Google's $305 billion digital advertising empire, which underpins Alphabet Inc.'s revenue and supports thousands of websites. A prior antitrust case against Google\u2019s search engine led to a less drastic remedy from Judge Amit Mehta, who rejected the DOJ\u2019s proposal to force Google to sell Chrome, citing AI-driven market changes. Google argues that emerging AI-powered advertising by rivals like Meta has rendered the DOJ\u2019s proposed remedies obsolete. Judge Brinkema has instructed both sides to consider Mehta\u2019s ruling in this case. Despite the legal challenges, Alphabet\u2019s stock rose over 20% after Mehta\u2019s decision, pushing the company to a $3 trillion market cap\u2014over $1 trillion higher than when Brinkema first labeled Google\u2019s ad tech a monopoly.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 05:07 PM\nSource:[MisionesOnline](https://misionesonline.net/2025/10/11/google-vuelve-a-los-tribunales-futuro-de-su-imperio/)\n\n**Google could be forced to change search operations in the UK**\nThe UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has granted Google 'strategic market status' (SMS) under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCCA), marking a pivotal moment in the country\u2019s post-Brexit digital regulation framework.

The DOJ is seeking structural remedies, including the divestiture of Google\u2019s ad exchange (AdX), open-sourcing the code that determines ad placement, and potentially divesting the ad server.

The European Commission sent formal information requests to Snapchat, Apple, and Google under the Digital Services Act (DSA), demanding details on safeguards for minors, including age verification, restrictions on harmful content (such as drugs, vaping, gambling, and non-consensual 'nudify' tools), and enforcement of parental controls. Snapchat affirmed its commitment to safety and existing youth protection tools. YouTube was asked to clarify how its recommendation algorithm filters harmful content for under-16s. Twenty-five EU member states, along with Norway and Iceland, supported a joint declaration advocating for continent-wide restrictions on social media access for children, inspired by Australia\u2019s under-16 ban; Belgium declined to sign, citing openness to alternative policy tools, while Estonia opposed bans, favoring digital education. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen backs a common EU digital age of majority, with an expert panel reviewing the proposal. In parallel, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) designated Google as having 'strategic market status' (SMS) in online search due to its dominance\u2014controlling over 90% of UK searches\u2014paving the way for tailored regulations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA)-like framework. The CMA warned that Google\u2019s market power affects over 200,000 UK businesses reliant on its advertising tools, and stronger competition could reduce costs. Google cautioned that stringent rules could stifle innovation and delay product launches, noting its early access to new services in the UK. The SMS designation will extend to AI-powered search features like Gemini, which remains under review. Apple and Google are also under investigation for potential SMS status in mobile ecosystems.

Possible interventions include fairer search rankings, easier access to alternative search engines, and greater publisher control over content used in AI-generated responses. The CMA may consult on specific measures later in 2025. Google's Senior Director for Competition, Oliver Bethell, warned that proposed changes could hinder UK innovation and slow AI product launches.

The CMA found that Google holds 'substantial and consolidated market power,' with over 90% of UK searches conducted via its platform. This nine-month investigation, which included consultations with more than 80 stakeholders, grants the CMA new powers to impose binding rules to promote fair competition. Will Hayter, CMA's Executive Director for Digital Markets, stated the decision enables 'targeted and proportionate actions to ensure search services remain open to effective competition,' fostering innovation and economic growth. Under the new regime, SMS-designated firms must comply with conduct requirements to prevent unfair harm to rivals or exploitation of users. The CMA plans to consult on specific interventions this year, potentially including 'fair ranking' in search results and greater editorial control over how Google uses content, including in AI-generated summaries. The SMS designation currently excludes Google's AI assistant Gemini, though the CMA will continue monitoring it as AI-driven search evolves. Other AI features like 'AI Overviews' and 'AI Mode' are included. The move reflects growing UK concern over U.S.-based Big Tech dominance in its digital economy, with critics arguing global platforms act as 'gatekeepers' limiting opportunities for local competitors.

While no violations have been found yet, the designation opens the door to 'proportionate and targeted' measures to ensure market competitiveness. The CMA expects to begin consultations on potential changes later in 2025.

The CMA previously outlined a 'roadmap' including potential requirements such as displaying alternative search engines to users, giving publishers greater control over content use, implementing fair ranking principles, and establishing an effective complaint mechanism for dissatisfied companies. This UK action is part of a broader global regulatory scrutiny of Google, including a US Supreme Court decision not to intervene in a case requiring Google to make major changes to Google Play, though Google won another legal battle over the potential breakup of Chrome or Android.

The DOJ seeks to force Google to divest its AdX ad\u2011exchange and to open\u2011source its auction logic, arguing that this is the quickest way to dismantle the feedback loop that entrenches Google\u2019s power. Google\u2019s lawyers counter that a divestiture would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet\u2019s ecosystem and propose a set of behavioral remedies instead.  The case could reshape the $305\u202fbillion digital advertising market that funds much of the open web.  Judge Leonie Brinkema\u2019s earlier decision declared that Google unlawfully monopolized the markets for publisher ad servers (via DoubleClick for Publishers) and ad exchanges (via AdX).  The DOJ\u2019s proposal is to break up the two services, while Google argues that behavioral fixes are sufficient.  Google\u2019s vice\u2011president of regulatory affairs, Lee\u2011Anne Mulholland, warned that \"Breaking apart integrated tools would make it harder for publishers to monetize their content and more expensive for advertisers to reach new customers, disproportionately hurting the small businesses who choose to use Google\u2019s tools to grow.\"  The trial is part of a broader shift in antitrust enforcement, mirroring a recent case where Judge Amit Mehta rejected a breakup of Google\u2019s Chrome browser in favor of behavioral remedies.  Judge Brinkema has indicated that the outcome may influence her final ruling, which is unlikely before 2026, and an appeal from Google is almost certain.

Google argues that these remedies are excessive and impractical, saying, 'We\u2019ve said from the start that DOJ\u2019s case misunderstands how digital advertising works and ignores how the landscape has dramatically evolved, with increasing competition and new entrants.' (Lee\u2011Anne Mulholland quote). Earlier this year, Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that Google maintained an illegal monopoly in the ad\u2011tech sector (Judge Brinkema ruling). The trial\u2019s remedy phase is expected to last about a week, with closing arguments scheduled for later this year (trial schedule). The case follows a European Commission fine of \u20ac2.95\u202fbillion ($3.47\u202fbillion) for ad\u2011tech dominance, where Brussels opted for behavioral changes instead of a breakup (EU fine). Google also recently won a U.S. antitrust case over its search monopoly, where a judge rejected demands to divest Chrome and ordered the company to share data with rivals; Alphabet shares surged more than 20% after that ruling (Alphabet share surge). Judge Brinkema has indicated she will consider the search case outcome when deciding remedies in the ad\u2011tech case (Brinkema statement). The proceedings are one of five pending U.S. antitrust actions against major tech firms, underscoring a bipartisan effort to curb Silicon Valley giants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 06:21 PM\nSource:[techdigest.ng](https://techdigest.ng/government-pushes-breakup/)\n\n**US Seeks to Split Google\u2019s Digital Advertising Business, Google Faces Antitrust Predicament Again**\nAfter successfully defending against a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit alleging illegal monopoly in its online search, Google now faces a new attempt to split its internet empire, this time focusing on its digital\u2011advertising business. The trial, set to begin Monday in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, will examine a series of alleged anticompetitive practices. Judge Leonie Blinkenma has already ruled that parts of Google\u2019s digital\u2011advertising technology constitute an illegal monopoly, stating that the company\u2019s conduct \"suppressed market competition and harmed the interests of online publishers who rely on the system for revenue.\" Over the next two weeks, Google and the DOJ will present evidence in a \"remedy\" hearing, after which Blinkenma will decide how to restore a fair market environment. The decision is unlikely to be issued before the end of the year, as additional filings and court arguments are expected to continue through November.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Google has said it will appeal the earlier ruling that its advertising network is monopolistic, although an appeal cannot be formally filed until the remedy is determined. The case, brought by the Biden administration in 2023, threatens the 17\u2011year\u2011old complex network that underpins Google\u2019s dominant digital\u2011advertising business. Digital\u2011advertising revenue accounts for the vast majority of the $3050\u202fbillion annual revenue generated by Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company, and serves as the \"lifeline\" for thousands of websites.\n\nIf the DOJ\u2019s demand is met, Blinkenma would order Google to divest part of its advertising technology. Google\u2019s lawyers warned that such a proposal would \"cause chaos and damage,\" affecting consumers and the internet ecosystem, while the DOJ argues that a split is the most effective and quickest way to weaken the monopoly, which has long stifled competition and innovation.\n\nGoogle claims it has already made sufficient adjustments to its Ad Manager system\u2014providing more options and pricing models\u2014to address the issues highlighted in Blinkenma\u2019s ruling. The legal battle over Google\u2019s advertising technology mirrors a recent case in which another federal judge ruled that Google\u2019s dominant search engine constituted an illegal monopoly and held a remedy hearing to discuss how to curb its misconduct. In that case, the DOJ also proposed that Google sell its popular Chrome browser, but Judge Amit Meta, in a ruling issued earlier this month, said that the rise of artificial\u2011intelligence technology reshaping the search market made such drastic measures unnecessary. Although Google does not fully agree with all aspects of Meta\u2019s decision, the ruling was widely seen as a \"minor penalty,\" which helped Alphabet\u2019s stock reach a new high. Since Meta\u2019s ruling, Alphabet\u2019s stock has risen 20%, making it the fourth company to reach a market capitalization of $3\u202ftrillion. In contrast, when Blinkenma identified Google\u2019s advertising technology as monopolistic in April, Alphabet\u2019s market cap increased by over $1\u202ftrillion.\n\nThere are indications that the outcome of the search\u2011monopoly case may influence the advertising\u2011technology case: Blinkenma has asked Google and the DOJ to comment on Meta\u2019s ruling in the upcoming hearing. Following the same strategy used in the search\u2011monopoly case, Google\u2019s lawyers have argued that AI technology used by competitors such as Meta Platforms is reshaping market operations, rendering the DOJ\u2019s \"aggressive\" proposal unnecessary. In pre\u2011trial arguments, a Google lawyer stated: 'The DOJ\u2019s sought remedy aims to eliminate a \"past\u2011tense\" problem that has already been surpassed by technological and market changes in digital\u2011advertising consumption.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:04 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/usstock/c/2025-09-22/doc-infrkmzm3488500.shtml)\n\n**Abigail Slater to Newsmax: Google Ruling Opens Competition**\nA top Justice Department official told Newsmax that a recent federal court ruling against Google marks the start of a \"digital defrosting,\" opening the way for new competition in online search and data markets. Abigail Slater, U.S. assistant attorney general for the DOJ's Antitrust Division, said on the \"Finnerty\" show that the landmark court decision will help restore competition in online search, describing it as the beginning of a long\u2011awaited thaw in the tech giant's online monopoly dominance. \"This matters for everyday Americans because it is leveling the playing field for online search. And it's giving back Americans control over their data,\" Slater said. The remarks followed U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's 226\u2011page opinion issued Tuesday in Washington, D.C., ordering remedies to curb Google's monopoly in the search market. While Mehta stopped short of breaking up the company, he endorsed measures aimed at dismantling barriers that have allowed Google to maintain a commanding market share for more than two decades. \"The judge has acknowledged that online search competition has been frozen in place for a couple of decades now,\" Slater said. \"And so the digital defrosting starts today with this opinion.\" Slater noted that the court recognized the critical role of consumer data in digital markets, calling it \"the oil of online markets.\" She said the remedies would help \"unlock data so that rival companies can thrive and compete with Google.\" Although she welcomed the ruling, Slater added that the Justice Department was disappointed by the pace of implementation: \"We are disappointed that it's not happening fast enough,\" she said. Slater also pointed to additional litigation ahead. \"We already have in place a separate court case that's playing out in Virginia that's going to trial again, two weeks from now. And that case is about this business of serving ads online and the technology stack behind that,\" she said, adding that trial proceedings would begin later this month. When asked about the impact of Google's practices on conservative media like Newsmax, Slater said the company's control had created upstream barriers that limited access to consumers, audiences, and advertising revenue. \"Because Google has had a gatekeeper status both in online search as well as this technology stack, it's been standing in the way of conservative media and access to consumers and eyeballs, and as well to advertising dollars, which is, of course, critically important to a thriving news environment,\" she said. Slater expressed optimism that the ruling would ultimately bring greater viewpoint diversity. \"We're hopeful that with more competition, we'll have more marketplace competition around viewpoint diversity,\" she said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 01:58 AM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/us/abigail-slater-google-antitrust/2025/09/03/id/1225001/)\n\n**Antitrust cases against US tech giants | News**\nThe article reports that five major antitrust cases are underway against leading U.S. technology companies, launched under both the Trump and Biden administrations.

In August 2025, US District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to decide how to address Google's dominance in internet search and advertising, a decision that could reshape the company's business model and the future of the online search market. The Justice Department's lawsuit, filed in 2020, alleges that Google has maintained its dominance through deals with device manufacturers and web browsers, making it nearly impossible for competitors to grow. In 2024, Judge Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly and shifted the focus to what remedies could restore fair competition. The DOJ is pushing for bold ideas, such as forcing Google to spin off its Chrome browser or even its Android system, to break its control over search. On the other hand, Google is advocating for milder measures that would simply restrict certain practices, such as exclusive search deals and paid placement agreements, while leaving its core business intact. Judge Mehta has hinted that he may consider a middle ground to find a balance between hard enforcement and practical results for the digital market. Four possible changes that could come into play: 1. One option on the table is a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser, a move that would hit one of the company's most powerful channels for search dominance. However, it is also the most legally and logistically complex solution, especially considering the challenge of finding a buyer who can maintain the open-source Chromium project that underpins the Chrome ecosystem. 2. A more targeted approach would be to curb Google's massive standard search deals, such as the one with Apple, which costs Google over $20 billion per year just to remain the default search engine on iPhones. Abolishing or restricting these agreements could finally give competitors some breathing room. 3. Another idea gaining traction is the shared use of data. Competitors, particularly AI-focused companies like OpenAI or Perplexity, argue that they cannot compete without access to Google's tightly guarded search data. Forcing Google to open up parts of this dataset could create level playing field and foster new innovations without dismantling the company's core products. 4. And then there's the consumer-oriented solution: screens. By requiring devices to display multiple search engine options to users, rather than defaulting to Google, regulators could give people more choice and competitors a fairer chance, without resorting to a complete separation. Impact on the entire industry: Every decision in the Google antitrust case could trigger a lengthy appeals process that could last 18 months or longer, and even longer if it reaches the Supreme Court. This means that changes to Google's business would happen slowly, but they will likely happen eventually. Investors are watching closely, and the company's stock has moved as the market considers the potential implications alongside Alphabet's work in AI and cloud computing. The case is being called the biggest tech antitrust battle since Microsoft decades ago. The outcome could change the way regulators treat dominant online platforms and set a new standard for dealing with companies that control AI, data, and critical digital ecosystems.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[Invezz - German](https://invezz.com/de/news/2025/08/19/kartellrechtlicher-showdown-bei-google-4-mogliche-schritte-die-suche-und-technologie-verandern-konnten/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of a US-mandated, fully completed breakup of Google before January 1, 2026, is extremely low, with estimates ranging from 1% to 2%. The key reasons for this consensus are: (1) Recent U.S. antitrust cases, including those against Google and Microsoft, have favored behavioral remedies (such as data-sharing mandates and oversight) rather than structural divestitures; courts have been especially reluctant to order breakups unless there is clear market failure and no other remedy suffices. (2) The current status of the DOJ's ad tech case against Google makes it highly unlikely that a ruling requiring divestiture will be issued and fully executed within the roughly 2.5 months before the resolution deadline. (3) Even if a breakup order were issued immediately, standard legal practice would allow Google to appeal, and courts almost always stay disruptive structural remedies during such appeals, a process that typically lasts years. (4) The complexity of unwinding and divesting large, integrated business divisions (e.g., AdX, YouTube, or Chrome) requires regulatory approvals, logistical planning, and asset transfers that cannot be completed in a matter of weeks. (5) Other factors, such as lobbying by Google, the incremental pace of the U.S. legal system, recent precedent (notably Judge Mehta\u2019s 2024 Google Search decision rejecting a breakup), and some influence from global (EU, UK) regulatory trends, all reinforce the low base rate for such an outcome. While political and public pressure for tougher action on Big Tech is higher than in past decades and the DOJ is seeking structural remedies, there is no credible sign of imminent divestiture or an unprecedented acceleration in the process. Experts see only highly improbable scenarios in which both an immediate, enforceable breakup order is issued and Google (against historical pattern) does not appeal or somehow completes the process by the deadline. The dominant expectation is that Google will remain structurally intact as of January 1, 2026, with robust behavioral, not structural, remedies most likely.",
