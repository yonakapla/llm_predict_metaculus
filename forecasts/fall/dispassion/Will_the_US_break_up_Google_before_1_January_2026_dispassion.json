Google appeals any structural order, and appellate proceedings prevent any divestiture from being finalized before January 1, 2026. Google continues to operate largely as is, with enhanced oversight or interoperability requirements. The DOJ claims partial victory, and the issue remains unresolved or ongoing into 2026 and beyond.",
            "yes_scenario": "Judge Brinkema orders an immediate and unambiguous structural breakup (e.g., divestiture of AdX and ad server businesses), and Google, either by not appealing or by being denied a stay on appeal, proceeds to rapidly execute the divestiture. The process is finalized and all required spin-offs/divestitures are completed before January 1, 2026. This would require exceptional bureaucratic speed, judicial resolve, and lack of procedural delays\u2014an extreme outlier scenario given precedent.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for structural breakups of large US tech firms is extremely low in recent decades. The bureaucratic politics model suggests that, even when agencies push for aggressive remedies, courts tend to favor incremental, reversible interventions over radical structural changes. The procedural timeline\u2014trial briefs, closing arguments, post-trial motions, a likely appeal, and possible Supreme Court review\u2014makes it nearly impossible for a structural breakup to be both ordered and fully implemented before January 1, 2026. All recent antitrust actions (including against Google) have resulted in behavioral, not structural, remedies so far. News coverage confirms that while the DOJ is seeking divestiture, most legal experts and even the presiding judge are signaling a preference for conduct remedies unless behavioral approaches fail. Even if a breakup were ordered, Google's appeal would almost certainly delay implementation beyond the resolution deadline. The requirement for the breakup to be 'fully completed' before January 1, 2026, sets a very high bar. Therefore, the probability that the US will break up Google (as defined) before 2026 is extremely low.",

Furthermore, the point that structural divestiture is likely to be a contingent, delayed penalty is consistent with how US courts have historically structured their orders: behavioral remedies and monitoring first, with the threat of breakup as leverage rather than a first-line solution. The forecaster also correctly notes that the current regulatory climate, while more aggressive, is still subject to the inertia of legal process and the status quo bias of US antitrust enforcement.

Moreover, the clear distinction between the imposition of a breakup order and the actual, completed execution of divestiture is crucial\u2014especially given the resolution criteria. This perspective properly incorporates both the legal and logistical barriers, as well as the slow-moving nature of major antitrust enforcement in US courts.

The forecast correctly situates the current cases within the broader context of US regulatory history and accurately notes that even with increasing public and bipartisan scrutiny, entrenched interests and the appeals process make it all but impossible for a full breakup to be ordered and completed on the required schedule.

The forecaster effectively highlights that the remedy phase in the ad-tech case is ongoing, with no ruling expected before 2026, and that any order would trigger appeals and make timely completion impossible.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThis forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy: Will the US break up google?\n\nIn recent years, [Google has come under intense scrutiny from regulators and policymakers in the United States,](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/03/tech-companies-us-eu-battles-00156110)raising questions about whether the tech giant could face a forced breakup. Once celebrated as an innovative pioneer in the internet age, Google\u2019s vast reach and influence now place it at the center of antitrust debates. The company, which dominates global online search, digital advertising, and mobile operating systems through its ownership of Android, is seen by many as holding an outsized share of power over critical digital infrastructure. [Critics argue that Google\u2019s practices have stifled competition, restricted consumer choice, and concentrated control over personal data and information flow.](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox)\n\nThe [U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies) and [several state attorneys general have filed multiple lawsuits against Google in recent years](https://www.njoag.gov/forty-attorneys-general-announce-historic-settlement-with-google-over-location-tracking-practices/), alleging monopolistic behavior in the company\u2019s search and advertising operations. These legal actions contend that Google has abused its market position by prioritizing its own services in search results, restricting rival advertisers, and creating barriers for competing tech firms. [In 2023, Google faced a landmark trial in the DOJ\u2019s largest antitrust case against a tech company in over two decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Google_LLC_(2023)), signaling the government\u2019s seriousness about curbing Google\u2019s power. [In October 2024, the DOJ said in a court filing that it might seek to have Google\u2019s core businesses broken up.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/09/tech/us-government-considers-a-breakup-of-google/index.html) Lawmakers and advocacy groups argue that a breakup\u2014splitting Google into separate entities for its search, advertising, and other business arms\u2014might be the only effective way to restore competition in the digital market.\n\nWhile Google has defended itself by asserting that its products benefit consumers and enhance competition, the company faces significant obstacles ahead. Its legal battles are likely to drag on for years, and the political climate increasingly favors stricter tech regulations.

The trial, focused on 'remedy' and lasting two weeks, involves the Department of Justice (DOJ) arguing that Google's practices are anticompetitive and embedded in complex algorithms, while Google's legal team, led by Karen Dunn, claims the proposed remedies are imprudent and radical, potentially dismantling the company's ad infrastructure. The DOJ insists that breaking up Google's ad tech is the most effective way to restore market fairness, while Google maintains that its 'Ad Manager' system has already been reformed with greater transparency and pricing options. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden, threatens Google's $305 billion digital advertising empire, which underpins Alphabet Inc.'s revenue and supports thousands of websites. A prior antitrust case against Google\u2019s search engine led to a less drastic remedy from Judge Amit Mehta, who rejected the DOJ\u2019s proposal to force Google to sell Chrome, citing AI-driven market changes. Google argues that emerging AI-powered advertising by rivals like Meta has rendered the DOJ\u2019s proposed remedies obsolete. Judge Brinkema has instructed both sides to consider Mehta\u2019s ruling in this case. Despite the legal challenges, Alphabet\u2019s stock rose over 20% after Mehta\u2019s decision, pushing the company to a $3 trillion market cap\u2014over $1 trillion higher than when Brinkema first labeled Google\u2019s ad tech a monopoly.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 05:07 PM\nSource:[MisionesOnline](https://misionesonline.net/2025/10/11/google-vuelve-a-los-tribunales-futuro-de-su-imperio/)\n\n**Google could be forced to change search operations in the UK**\nThe UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has granted Google 'strategic market status' (SMS) under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCCA), marking a pivotal moment in the country\u2019s post-Brexit digital regulation framework.

The DOJ is seeking structural remedies, including the divestiture of Google\u2019s ad exchange (AdX), open-sourcing the code that determines ad placement, and potentially divesting the ad server. The DOJ argues that behavioral constraints alone are insufficient to break Google\u2019s entrenched control, emphasizing that without changing incentives, the monopoly will persist. They also advocate expanding AdX access to all inventory types and routing all bids through a transparent platform like Prebid. In contrast, Google proposed lighter-touch behavioral remedies, such as contract changes and interoperability with rival ad servers, arguing that a breakup is unnecessary. Key witnesses included publishers like Grant Whitmore (Advance Local), Stephanie Layser (AWS), and Matthew Wheatland (Daily Mail), who criticized Google\u2019s opaque auction logic and warned that behavioral fixes leave too much room for manipulation. Elizabeth Douglas (wikiHow), a last-minute Google witness, acknowledged reliance on AdX but expressed concern over disruption from change.

The European Commission sent formal information requests to Snapchat, Apple, and Google under the Digital Services Act (DSA), demanding details on safeguards for minors, including age verification, restrictions on harmful content (such as drugs, vaping, gambling, and non-consensual 'nudify' tools), and enforcement of parental controls. Snapchat affirmed its commitment to safety and existing youth protection tools. YouTube was asked to clarify how its recommendation algorithm filters harmful content for under-16s. Twenty-five EU member states, along with Norway and Iceland, supported a joint declaration advocating for continent-wide restrictions on social media access for children, inspired by Australia\u2019s under-16 ban; Belgium declined to sign, citing openness to alternative policy tools, while Estonia opposed bans, favoring digital education. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen backs a common EU digital age of majority, with an expert panel reviewing the proposal. In parallel, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) designated Google as having 'strategic market status' (SMS) in online search due to its dominance\u2014controlling over 90% of UK searches\u2014paving the way for tailored regulations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA)-like framework. The CMA warned that Google\u2019s market power affects over 200,000 UK businesses reliant on its advertising tools, and stronger competition could reduce costs. Google cautioned that stringent rules could stifle innovation and delay product launches, noting its early access to new services in the UK. The SMS designation will extend to AI-powered search features like Gemini, which remains under review. Apple and Google are also under investigation for potential SMS status in mobile ecosystems.

The CMA stated that Google controls over 90% of UK search traffic, enabling it to intervene to ensure search services are 'open to effective competition'\u2014though this is not a finding of wrongdoing. Possible interventions include fairer search rankings, easier access to alternative search engines, and greater publisher control over content used in AI-generated responses. The CMA may consult on specific measures later in 2025. Google's Senior Director for Competition, Oliver Bethell, warned that proposed changes could hinder UK innovation and slow AI product launches. Google recently announced a \u00a35 billion ($6.65 billion) investment in the UK. The ruling marks the CMA\u2019s first use of new powers, with a second probe into Android expected. The US Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice are also investigating Google\u2019s advertising practices, while the EU fined Google $3.45 billion last month for anti-competitive adtech behavior. Although Google\u2019s Gemini AI assistant is not currently under scrutiny, other AI search features like AI Overviews and AI Mode are.

The CMA found that Google holds 'substantial and consolidated market power,' with over 90% of UK searches conducted via its platform. This nine-month investigation, which included consultations with more than 80 stakeholders, grants the CMA new powers to impose binding rules to promote fair competition. Will Hayter, CMA's Executive Director for Digital Markets, stated the decision enables 'targeted and proportionate actions to ensure search services remain open to effective competition,' fostering innovation and economic growth. Under the new regime, SMS-designated firms must comply with conduct requirements to prevent unfair harm to rivals or exploitation of users. The CMA plans to consult on specific interventions this year, potentially including 'fair ranking' in search results and greater editorial control over how Google uses content, including in AI-generated summaries. The SMS designation currently excludes Google's AI assistant Gemini, though the CMA will continue monitoring it as AI-driven search evolves. Other AI features like 'AI Overviews' and 'AI Mode' are included. The move reflects growing UK concern over U.S.-based Big Tech dominance in its digital economy, with critics arguing global platforms act as 'gatekeepers' limiting opportunities for local competitors.

While no violations have been found yet, the designation opens the door to 'proportionate and targeted' measures to ensure market competitiveness. The CMA expects to begin consultations on potential changes later in 2025. Google warned that proposed actions could 'hinder innovation and growth in the UK,' emphasizing that UK consumers and businesses are among the first to benefit from Google's innovations, with Google Search contributing \u00a3118 billion ($158.5 billion) to the UK economy in 2023 alone. The CMA confirmed Google's dominance, stating over 90% of UK searches occur on its platform. CMA's digital markets head, Will Hatter, noted that Google maintains a strategic position in search and related advertising. The CMA previously outlined a 'roadmap' including potential requirements such as displaying alternative search engines to users, giving publishers greater control over content use, implementing fair ranking principles, and establishing an effective complaint mechanism for dissatisfied companies. This UK action is part of a broader global regulatory scrutiny of Google, including a US Supreme Court decision not to intervene in a case requiring Google to make major changes to Google Play, though Google won another legal battle over the potential breakup of Chrome or Android.

The DOJ seeks to force Google to divest its AdX ad\u2011exchange and to open\u2011source its auction logic, arguing that this is the quickest way to dismantle the feedback loop that entrenches Google\u2019s power. Google\u2019s lawyers counter that a divestiture would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet\u2019s ecosystem and propose a set of behavioral remedies instead.  The case could reshape the $305\u202fbillion digital advertising market that funds much of the open web.  Judge Leonie Brinkema\u2019s earlier decision declared that Google unlawfully monopolized the markets for publisher ad servers (via DoubleClick for Publishers) and ad exchanges (via AdX).  The DOJ\u2019s proposal is to break up the two services, while Google argues that behavioral fixes are sufficient.  Google\u2019s vice\u2011president of regulatory affairs, Lee\u2011Anne Mulholland, warned that \"Breaking apart integrated tools would make it harder for publishers to monetize their content and more expensive for advertisers to reach new customers, disproportionately hurting the small businesses who choose to use Google\u2019s tools to grow.\"  The trial is part of a broader shift in antitrust enforcement, mirroring a recent case where Judge Amit Mehta rejected a breakup of Google\u2019s Chrome browser in favor of behavioral remedies.  Judge Brinkema has indicated that the outcome may influence her final ruling, which is unlikely before 2026, and an appeal from Google is almost certain.  The case will test the limits of existing antitrust laws and could redefine how the internet monetizes information.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 05:03 PM\nSource:[NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-09-23-a-legal-reckoning-for-the-digital-ad-market.html)\n\n**US Government Pushes for Breakup of Google\u2019s Ad Tech Business in Federal Court - Tech Digest News**\nGoogle is facing a new antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that seeks to force the company to break up its advertising technology (ad\u2011tech) business. According to court filings, the DOJ will require Google to divest its ad\u2011publisher and ad\u2011exchange operations and impose a 10\u2011year ban on operating an ad exchange after any spinoffs are completed (court filings). Google argues that these remedies are excessive and impractical, saying, 'We\u2019ve said from the start that DOJ\u2019s case misunderstands how digital advertising works and ignores how the landscape has dramatically evolved, with increasing competition and new entrants.' (Lee\u2011Anne Mulholland quote). Earlier this year, Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that Google maintained an illegal monopoly in the ad\u2011tech sector (Judge Brinkema ruling). The trial\u2019s remedy phase is expected to last about a week, with closing arguments scheduled for later this year (trial schedule). The case follows a European Commission fine of \u20ac2.95\u202fbillion ($3.47\u202fbillion) for ad\u2011tech dominance, where Brussels opted for behavioral changes instead of a breakup (EU fine). Google also recently won a U.S. antitrust case over its search monopoly, where a judge rejected demands to divest Chrome and ordered the company to share data with rivals; Alphabet shares surged more than 20% after that ruling (Alphabet share surge). Judge Brinkema has indicated she will consider the search case outcome when deciding remedies in the ad\u2011tech case (Brinkema statement). The proceedings are one of five pending U.S. antitrust actions against major tech firms, underscoring a bipartisan effort to curb Silicon Valley giants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 06:21 PM\nSource:[techdigest.ng](https://techdigest.ng/government-pushes-breakup/)\n\n**US Seeks to Split Google\u2019s Digital Advertising Business, Google Faces Antitrust Predicament Again**\nAfter successfully defending against a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit alleging illegal monopoly in its online search, Google now faces a new attempt to split its internet empire, this time focusing on its digital\u2011advertising business. The trial, set to begin Monday in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, will examine a series of alleged anticompetitive practices. Judge Leonie Blinkenma has already ruled that parts of Google\u2019s digital\u2011advertising technology constitute an illegal monopoly, stating that the company\u2019s conduct \"suppressed market competition and harmed the interests of online publishers who rely on the system for revenue.\" Over the next two weeks, Google and the DOJ will present evidence in a \"remedy\" hearing, after which Blinkenma will decide how to restore a fair market environment. The decision is unlikely to be issued before the end of the year, as additional filings and court arguments are expected to continue through November.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Google has said it will appeal the earlier ruling that its advertising network is monopolistic, although an appeal cannot be formally filed until the remedy is determined. The case, brought by the Biden administration in 2023, threatens the 17\u2011year\u2011old complex network that underpins Google\u2019s dominant digital\u2011advertising business. Digital\u2011advertising revenue accounts for the vast majority of the $3050\u202fbillion annual revenue generated by Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company, and serves as the \"lifeline\" for thousands of websites.\n\nIf the DOJ\u2019s demand is met, Blinkenma would order Google to divest part of its advertising technology. Google\u2019s lawyers warned that such a proposal would \"cause chaos and damage,\" affecting consumers and the internet ecosystem, while the DOJ argues that a split is the most effective and quickest way to weaken the monopoly, which has long stifled competition and innovation.\n\nGoogle claims it has already made sufficient adjustments to its Ad Manager system\u2014providing more options and pricing models\u2014to address the issues highlighted in Blinkenma\u2019s ruling. The legal battle over Google\u2019s advertising technology mirrors a recent case in which another federal judge ruled that Google\u2019s dominant search engine constituted an illegal monopoly and held a remedy hearing to discuss how to curb its misconduct. In that case, the DOJ also proposed that Google sell its popular Chrome browser, but Judge Amit Meta, in a ruling issued earlier this month, said that the rise of artificial\u2011intelligence technology reshaping the search market made such drastic measures unnecessary. Although Google does not fully agree with all aspects of Meta\u2019s decision, the ruling was widely seen as a \"minor penalty,\" which helped Alphabet\u2019s stock reach a new high. Since Meta\u2019s ruling, Alphabet\u2019s stock has risen 20%, making it the fourth company to reach a market capitalization of $3\u202ftrillion. In contrast, when Blinkenma identified Google\u2019s advertising technology as monopolistic in April, Alphabet\u2019s market cap increased by over $1\u202ftrillion.\n\nThere are indications that the outcome of the search\u2011monopoly case may influence the advertising\u2011technology case: Blinkenma has asked Google and the DOJ to comment on Meta\u2019s ruling in the upcoming hearing. Following the same strategy used in the search\u2011monopoly case, Google\u2019s lawyers have argued that AI technology used by competitors such as Meta Platforms is reshaping market operations, rendering the DOJ\u2019s \"aggressive\" proposal unnecessary. In pre\u2011trial arguments, a Google lawyer stated: 'The DOJ\u2019s sought remedy aims to eliminate a \"past\u2011tense\" problem that has already been surpassed by technological and market changes in digital\u2011advertising consumption.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:04 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/usstock/c/2025-09-22/doc-infrkmzm3488500.shtml)\n\n**Abigail Slater to Newsmax: Google Ruling Opens Competition**\nA top Justice Department official told Newsmax that a recent federal court ruling against Google marks the start of a \"digital defrosting,\" opening the way for new competition in online search and data markets. Abigail Slater, U.S. assistant attorney general for the DOJ's Antitrust Division, said on the \"Finnerty\" show that the landmark court decision will help restore competition in online search, describing it as the beginning of a long\u2011awaited thaw in the tech giant's online monopoly dominance. \"This matters for everyday Americans because it is leveling the playing field for online search. And it's giving back Americans control over their data,\" Slater said. The remarks followed U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's 226\u2011page opinion issued Tuesday in Washington, D.C., ordering remedies to curb Google's monopoly in the search market. While Mehta stopped short of breaking up the company, he endorsed measures aimed at dismantling barriers that have allowed Google to maintain a commanding market share for more than two decades. \"The judge has acknowledged that online search competition has been frozen in place for a couple of decades now,\" Slater said. \"And so the digital defrosting starts today with this opinion.\" Slater noted that the court recognized the critical role of consumer data in digital markets, calling it \"the oil of online markets.\" She said the remedies would help \"unlock data so that rival companies can thrive and compete with Google.\" Although she welcomed the ruling, Slater added that the Justice Department was disappointed by the pace of implementation: \"We are disappointed that it's not happening fast enough,\" she said. Slater also pointed to additional litigation ahead. \"We already have in place a separate court case that's playing out in Virginia that's going to trial again, two weeks from now. And that case is about this business of serving ads online and the technology stack behind that,\" she said, adding that trial proceedings would begin later this month. When asked about the impact of Google's practices on conservative media like Newsmax, Slater said the company's control had created upstream barriers that limited access to consumers, audiences, and advertising revenue. \"Because Google has had a gatekeeper status both in online search as well as this technology stack, it's been standing in the way of conservative media and access to consumers and eyeballs, and as well to advertising dollars, which is, of course, critically important to a thriving news environment,\" she said. Slater expressed optimism that the ruling would ultimately bring greater viewpoint diversity. \"We're hopeful that with more competition, we'll have more marketplace competition around viewpoint diversity,\" she said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 01:58 AM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/us/abigail-slater-google-antitrust/2025/09/03/id/1225001/)\n\n**Antitrust cases against US tech giants | News**\nThe article reports that five major antitrust cases are underway against leading U.S. technology companies, launched under both the Trump and Biden administrations.

In August 2025, US District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to decide how to address Google's dominance in internet search and advertising, a decision that could reshape the company's business model and the future of the online search market. The Justice Department's lawsuit, filed in 2020, alleges that Google has maintained its dominance through deals with device manufacturers and web browsers, making it nearly impossible for competitors to grow. In 2024, Judge Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly and shifted the focus to what remedies could restore fair competition. The DOJ is pushing for bold ideas, such as forcing Google to spin off its Chrome browser or even its Android system, to break its control over search. On the other hand, Google is advocating for milder measures that would simply restrict certain practices, such as exclusive search deals and paid placement agreements, while leaving its core business intact. Judge Mehta has hinted that he may consider a middle ground to find a balance between hard enforcement and practical results for the digital market. Four possible changes that could come into play: 1. One option on the table is a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser, a move that would hit one of the company's most powerful channels for search dominance. However, it is also the most legally and logistically complex solution, especially considering the challenge of finding a buyer who can maintain the open-source Chromium project that underpins the Chrome ecosystem. 2. A more targeted approach would be to curb Google's massive standard search deals, such as the one with Apple, which costs Google over $20 billion per year just to remain the default search engine on iPhones. Abolishing or restricting these agreements could finally give competitors some breathing room. 3. Another idea gaining traction is the shared use of data. Competitors, particularly AI-focused companies like OpenAI or Perplexity, argue that they cannot compete without access to Google's tightly guarded search data. Forcing Google to open up parts of this dataset could create level playing field and foster new innovations without dismantling the company's core products. 4. And then there's the consumer-oriented solution: screens. By requiring devices to display multiple search engine options to users, rather than defaulting to Google, regulators could give people more choice and competitors a fairer chance, without resorting to a complete separation. Impact on the entire industry: Every decision in the Google antitrust case could trigger a lengthy appeals process that could last 18 months or longer, and even longer if it reaches the Supreme Court. This means that changes to Google's business would happen slowly, but they will likely happen eventually. Investors are watching closely, and the company's stock has moved as the market considers the potential implications alongside Alphabet's work in AI and cloud computing. The case is being called the biggest tech antitrust battle since Microsoft decades ago. The outcome could change the way regulators treat dominant online platforms and set a new standard for dealing with companies that control AI, data, and critical digital ecosystems.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[Invezz - German](https://invezz.com/de/news/2025/08/19/kartellrechtlicher-showdown-bei-google-4-mogliche-schritte-die-suche-und-technologie-verandern-konnten/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts surveyed\u2014across antitrust law, economics, tech policy, and political science\u2014are nearly unanimous in assigning an extremely low probability (typically 1-2%) that the US will break up Google before January 1, 2026, as defined by the resolution criteria (full completion of a mandated structural remedy/divestiture). Their analysis converges on several key reasons: \n\n1. Legal and Procedural Precedent: Modern US antitrust cases against tech giants (e.g., Microsoft, recent Google search and ad-tech cases) have consistently resulted in behavioral or conduct remedies rather than breakups, even when monopoly was found. Judges are reluctant to impose structural remedies, citing market disruption and technological change.\n\n2. Litigation and Appeal Timelines: Even if the current Google ad-tech case results in a breakup order, the process of post-trial briefs, final ruling, and especially appeals (which almost always lead to a stay of enforcement) would ensure no divestiture or breakup could be fully completed by January 1, 2026. Historical examples show breakups take years, not months.\n\n3. Case Status: As of mid-October 2025, the remedy phase in Google\u2019s major antitrust case is ongoing; rulings and any potential remedy are expected no earlier than 2026.\n\n4. Political and Regulatory Climate: While there is bipartisan appetite for strong antitrust enforcement and the DOJ is actively seeking structural remedies, judicial and institutional inertia heavily favor incremental, behavioral remedies for now. The regulatory environment in the EU and UK is similarly tough but stops short of enforced structural breakups.\n\n5. Google\u2019s Organizational Resources and Legal Rights: Google\u2019s deep legal resources, right to appeal, and ability to request stays ensure that any breakup order would be contested, further delaying implementation beyond the deadline.\n\nAlthough experts highlight that the DOJ\u2019s requests for a breakup and the current political momentum slightly increase the chance of such an outcome, the historical base rate and procedural realities make a completed breakup before January 1, 2026, extraordinarily unlikely. The consensus across all domains is that a 'No' outcome is overwhelmingly the most probable scenario.",
