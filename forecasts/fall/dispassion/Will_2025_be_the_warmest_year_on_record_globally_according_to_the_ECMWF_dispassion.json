Your 20% estimate is methodologically sound: it valorizes the ensemble of real-time evidence while legitimately reserving a (moderate) probability for ongoing surprises from persistent marine heat or late-year global anomalies.

Your use of explicitly cited expert consensus and the Copernicus/ECMWF data through September 2025 underlines the EVT forecast: base rates for consecutive records are low, and existing YTD data shows 2025 running just below 2024. The 15% probability accurately reflects this, capturing real uncertainty in the tails due to oceanic inertia, but not exaggerating the likelihood of another record.

However, from the perspective of classic time series analysis, the use of ensemble analogues alone may not sufficiently represent the specific regime-switching tendency in annual temperature extremes, especially coming off an exceptionally strong El Ni\u00f1o. Time series methods often emphasize explicit modeling of interannual autocorrelation and mean reversion; the historical series suggests the expected year following a major record is not just less likely to break the record, but often shows conspicuous regression toward the mean. The strong consensus in the news and expert commentary that 2025 is tracking just under 2024 is more easily quantified in ARIMA-type or statistical changepoint models that put even greater emphasis on the status quo after a large deviation than is typical in climate model ensemble means. Also, ensemble models may slightly overestimate tail risk by not fully conditioning on how rare three consecutive records have historically been. Overall, your 20% probability is reasonable, but a fully time series\u2013driven approach might push the odds even lower by explicitly quantifying the tendency toward moderation immediately post\u2013El Ni\u00f1o."

In summer\u202f2025 the North Sea\u2019s mean surface temperature reached 15.7\u202f\u00b0C, about 3\u202f\u00b0C above the long\u2011term average, and the BSH recorded a 55\u2011day marine heatwave at the Kiel lighthouse station \u2013 the longest since measurements began in 1969.  The Mediterranean averaged 26.9\u202f\u00b0C in July\u202f2025, the highest on record, and the Copernicus Marine Service noted that 65\u202f% of the basin\u2019s surface was affected by the strongest heatwave ever observed in July.  A meta\u2011analysis by Geomar\u2011Helmholtz\u2011Kiel found that a warming of only a few tenths of a degree can push seagrass beds, fish stocks and coastal habitats into high\u2011risk zones.  The article cites a 0.8\u202f\u00b0C additional warming scenario that could reduce fish stocks by 30\u201340\u202f%, threatening fisheries in Italy, Greece and Spain.  It also warns that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may weaken enough to reach a tipping point within two decades, with potential costs of several trillion euros by 2100, according to the Max\u2011Planck\u2011Gesellschaft.  Arctic sea\u2011ice volume has dropped by roughly 75\u202f% since the 1980s, and the recent winter showed an unusually low ice extent, signalling a rapid system shift.  The piece concludes that Europe must intensify marine\u2011heat\u2011wave early\u2011warning systems, adaptive fisheries management and nature\u2011based coastal protection, but stresses that without substantial emission cuts these measures will lag behind reality.

Using historical mortality data, they estimated about 24,400 excess deaths in those cities during that period. Comparing to a counterfactual world that was not 1.3\u202f\u00b0C warmer, they found that nearly 70\u202f% \u2013 16,500 deaths \u2013 were attributable to global warming, suggesting climate change could have tripled the number of heat deaths this summer.

The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summers of 2023, 2024 and 2025 were the hottest on record, according to the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and NOAA. The June\u2011to\u2011August period of 2025 was the third hottest on record, with a global average temperature 0.47\u202f\u00b0C above the 1991\u20112000 average (C3S) and 1.02\u202f\u00b0C hotter than the 20th\u2011century average (NOAA). The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ranked the latest summer as the third hottest in its 176\u2011year record. A new study by researchers at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found that climate change likely tripled the number of heat\u2011related deaths in European cities this summer. In 854 urban areas examined, 68\u202f% of the estimated 24,400 heat deaths were attributable to climate change, a figure that covers only about 30\u202f% of Europe\u2019s population (study). Friederike Otto, a co\u2011author, said, 'Many of these [people] would not have died without climate change.' The study also notes that the proportion of heat deaths attributable to climate change is creeping up. In the U.S., heat waves have increased from an average of two per summer in the 1960s to more than six today, with the heat\u2011wave season lengthening from about 20 days to over 70 days. A 2021 Science study projects that children born in 2020 will experience seven times as many heat waves over their lifetime as those born in 1960.

It also notes that 2024 was the first year on record to have an average temperature more than 1.5\u202f\u00b0C above the pre\u2011industrial era, a milestone that does not yet breach the Paris Agreement threshold but signals the world is about 1.2\u20131.3\u202f\u00b0C above pre\u2011industrial levels.

In India, 385 people died from extreme rainfall on 30\u202fJuly\u202f2024 in Kerala, triggering landslides; major basins such as the Godavari, Krishna, Ganges and parts of the upstream Indus were above\u2011normal. The report links the weakening monsoon circulation with intensified atmospheric moisture from global warming, warning that farmers and authorities remain unprepared for the resulting extreme rainfall and prolonged dry spells. Ice loss reached a third consecutive year of widespread melt, with an estimated 450\u202fgigatonnes of ice disappearing in 2024 \u2013 enough to fill 180\u202fmillion Olympic\u2011sized swimming pools \u2013 and adding 1.2\u202fmm to global sea level.

It cites that seven of the ten most climate\u2011vulnerable nations worldwide are in Africa, and that over the past 60\u202fyears the continent has warmed faster than the global average, with the climate changing at rates unprecedented in at least 2,000\u202fyears \u2013 a claim quoted directly from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. The report notes that 35\u202f% of the world\u2019s deaths from extreme weather, climate or water stress over the last 50\u202fyears occurred in Africa, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It states that the average annual maximum temperature in northern and southern Africa is likely to be close to 4\u202f\u00b0C above normal. Africa\u2019s average annual surface temperature in 2024 was about 0.86\u202f\u00b0C above the 1991\u20112020 mean, with North Africa the fastest\u2011warming region at 1.28\u202f\u00b0C above that period. The report warns that under a business\u2011as\u2011usual scenario temperatures could rise 3\u20116\u202f\u00b0C by century\u2011end, with the greatest increases projected for the northern and southern parts of the continent and the fastest rate of change on the western side. Marine heat waves (MHWs) affected an area of 30\u202fmillion\u202fkm\u00b2 between January and April\u202f2024 and 1.5\u202fmillion\u202fkm\u00b2 in the second half of the year \u2013 the highest since records began in 1993. The report also highlights that between 2021 and 2025 Africa experienced its deadliest climate crisis in over a decade, with at least 221.57\u202fmillion people affected and 28,759 deaths, more than triple the number recorded between 2016 and 2020. These figures, based on data available up to May\u202f2025, are likely to rise further by year\u2011end.

Wildfires burned a record 382,000\u202fha (944,000\u202facres) in Spain, exceeding the 306,000\u202fha (756,000\u202facres) burned in 2022, per the EU\u2019s European Forest Fire Information System. The summer was particularly dry, especially in the northwest where most fires occurred. The EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service notes Europe has warmed twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s. Scientists warn that climate\u2011change\u2011driven heat and dryness increase the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and wildfires, heightening health and environmental risks. The main driver of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline, oil and coal.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 01:51 PM\nSource:[Newsday](https://www.newsday.com/business/spain-hottest-summer-climate-i80743)\n\n**Global Warming: 2024 Recorded as the Hottest Year on Record**\nAccording to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the global average surface temperature has been increasing since 1967. In 2024, the global temperatures reached a historic high, exceeding the pre-industrial era average temperature by 1.5 degrees. This marks the first time the 1.5 degree threshold, critical according to the Paris Agreement, has been surpassed. The global average temperature in 2024 was 15.1 degrees, an increase of 0.12 degrees from 2023. The surface temperature has been above the pre-industrial era average temperature of 1.4 degrees in 2023 and 1.1 degrees in 2022. Experts warn that exceeding the 1.5 degree limit is a critical threshold for the climate and that temperature increases will lead to more severe weather events, droughts, and risks to ecosystems. NASA data also confirms that the average surface temperature in 2024 was the highest on record. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that the 2015-2024 period was the warmest on record. A study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences found that the warming of the oceans played a key role in the record-breaking temperatures in 2024. The global average surface temperature was measured at 16.46 degrees in May, making it the third hottest June on record. The surface temperature in Europe was 18.46 degrees in May, making it the fifth hottest June on record.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 08:01 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/ekonomi/kuresel-isinma-2024-kaydedilen-en-sicak-yil-18894448-haberi/)\n\n**After the puzzling warmth in 2023 and 2024, what could 2025 have in store?**\nAfter 12 consecutive months of record-breaking warmth, Earth's temperature has fallen, but is still near record highs.

Zeke Hausfather from Berkeley Earth notes that 2025 is still on track to be one of the top three warmest years on record, with a 'very unlikely' chance of setting a new record, but a 'virtually certain' chance of being a top three warmest year. The end of El Ni\u00f1o, a natural cyclical warming in the Pacific Ocean, may have contributed to the recent cooling trend.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 04:34 PM\nSource:[The Weather Network](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/en/news/climate/impacts/after-the-puzzling-warmth-in-2023-and-2024-what-could-2025-have-in-store)\n\n**2025 May\u0131s\u0131, Tarihin En S\u0131cak \u0130kinci May\u0131s\u0131 Olacak**\nAccording to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, May 2025 was the second-hottest May on record globally, with an average surface temperature of 15.79\u00b0C.

Carlo Buontempo, Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, stated, 'May 2025 briefly interrupted the 1.5\u00b0C above trend seen in 21 out of the last 22 months, but the warming of the climate system will continue, and this threshold will be exceeded again soon.' The average surface temperature of 15.79\u00b0C is 0.53\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average and 1.4\u00b0C above the pre-industrial era average of 1850-1900. This temperature increase does not exceed the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, but it clearly shows that global warming continues.

This breaks a 21-month streak of temperatures exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial times. Carlo Buontempo, C3S director, stated, 'Whilst this may offer a brief respite for the planet, we do expect the 1.5C threshold to be exceeded again in the near future due to the continued warming of the climate system.'

The month was marked by unusually high sea surface temperatures, with 20.79\u00b0C, also the second highest on record. Experts note that 'large areas in the north-eastern North Atlantic, which experienced marine heatwaves, recorded record surface temperatures for the month.' The health of the oceans is a key focus of the third United Nations Conference on the Oceans (UNOC), currently taking place in Nice. The conference highlights the importance of containing the 1.5\u00b0C global warming target, as exceeding it would lead to more frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, and droughts. Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), notes that 'this brief respite may offer a brief respite for the planet, but we expect the 1.5\u00b0C threshold to be crossed again in the near future due to ongoing climate change.'

The Copernicus 'C3S' newsletter reported that last month was the second-hottest May on record globally, only surpassed by May 2024. In the period from March to May, the Northern Hemisphere recorded its second-highest average temperature for spring, reflecting the ongoing trend of rising global temperatures. The records show that the average global temperature last month was 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than the pre-industrial period between 1850 and 1900, which saw a significant expansion of fossil fuel burning for industrial purposes. Although May 2025 did not exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, as happened in 21 of the last 22 months, Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo confirmed that this 'temporary retreat' will not last, due to the continued global warming phenomenon, according to Reuters. Carlo Buontempo said, 'This may provide a brief respite for the planet, but we expect to exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold again in the near future due to the continued rise in global temperature.' Emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from fossil fuel burning are the main cause of climate change, and last year was the warmest on record globally. A study by the 'World Weather Attribution' group found that the recent heatwave in Iceland and Greenland was 3 degrees Celsius stronger due to climate change caused by human activities, leading to accelerated melting of Greenland's ice. Another study published by the organization found that 49% of the world's population lived through at least 30 additional days of extreme heat. The study defined 'extreme heat days' as those exceeding 90% of the highest recorded temperatures between 1991 and 2020. Copernicus' European records date back to 1940 and are regularly audited and compared to global climate records dating back to 1850, giving confidence in the alarming trends observed, according to experts.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 10:20 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/climate/2025/6/11/2025-%d9%8a%d8%b3%d8%ac%d9%84-%d8%ab%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a-%d8%a3%d9%83%d8%ab%d8%b1-%d8%b4%d9%87%d9%88%d8%b1-%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%8a%d9%88-%d8%ad%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a9-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89)\n\n**May 2025: The Second-Hottest May on Record, Global Warming Continues**\nAccording to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), May 2025 was the second-hottest May globally in recorded history, with an average surface temperature of 15.79\u00b0C, 0.53\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. This temperature increase did not exceed the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, but it clearly shows the continuation of global warming. The past 10 years have been the warmest 10 years on record.

The unusually dry spring in Europe, particularly in the northwest, has raised concerns about water scarcity and agricultural losses. C3S data shows that Turkey, Ukraine, southern Russia, and northern and central Europe experienced below-average rainfall in May 2025, with some areas recording the lowest soil moisture and rainfall levels since 1979. Similar drought conditions were observed in North America, the Horn of Africa, South Africa, South America, Central Asia, and southern Australia.

The heat remained as the new norm on land and in the oceans, many of which are still experiencing 'unusually high' temperatures, as reported by the European Copernicus Observatory on Wednesday (June 11, 2025). Although it has returned below the 1.5\u00b0C threshold of warming compared to the pre-industrial era, last month was the second hottest May in history, just behind May 2024, explained the observatory. The month was marked by a mean temperature of 15.79\u00b0C, which is 0.12\u00b0C cooler than the record set last year but slightly warmer than May 2020, which ranks third. The same applies to the oceans: with a surface temperature of 20.79\u00b0C, the month was also the second warmest in recent history, just behind May 2024. However, these temperatures remained 'unusually high' in many seas or ocean basins, observes Copernicus. 'Large areas in the northeast of the North Atlantic, which have suffered heat waves, have recorded record-breaking surface temperatures for the month. Most of the Mediterranean Sea was much warmer than average,' say the experts. Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), notes that 'May 2025 interrupts a long sequence of unprecedented months above 1.5\u00b0C of warming.' This figure is a symbolic threshold agreed upon in the Paris Agreement on climate change. 'This may offer a brief respite for the planet, but it is expected that the 1.5\u00b0C threshold will be exceeded again in the near future due to the continued warming of the climate system,' he highlights.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[El Litoral](https://www.ellitoral.com/informacion-general/observatorio-copernicus-mundo-volvio-vivir-mayo-caluroso_0_odRMKC8QLv.html)\n\n**May 2025 was world's second-hottest on record, says EU climate agency**\nThe world experienced its second-warmest May on record, with a global surface temperature 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than in the pre-industrial period, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This break in extraordinary heat is unlikely to last, and scientists warn that the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold will be exceeded again in the near future. Carlo Buontempo, C3S director, said, 'Whilst this may offer a brief respite for the planet, we do expect the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold to be exceeded again in the near future due to the continued warming of the climate system.' A separate study found that human-caused climate change made a record-breaking heatwave in Iceland and Greenland about 3C hotter than it otherwise would have been, contributing to a huge additional melting of Greenland's ice sheet.

According to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the temperature in May was 0.65 degrees above the average between 1991 and 2020, marking 12 consecutive months of record-breaking heat. Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said, 'It's impacting, but not surprising, that we've reached this streak of 12 months. While this sequence of record months will eventually be interrupted, the general trend of climate change remains and there are no signs of a change in this trend.' Buontempo added, 'We're living in unprecedented times, but we also have an unprecedented ability to monitor the climate and this can help inform our actions. This series of warmer months will be remembered as relatively cool, but if we manage to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in the near future, we could return to these 'cool' temperatures by the end of the century.' The global average temperature in May was 1.52 degrees above the pre-industrial average of 1850-1900, marking the 11th consecutive month with at least 1.5 degrees of warming. Ann Harrison, climate policy advisor for Amnesty International, noted that 'recent floods in Brazil, Kenya, and Germany, and record-breaking heatwaves in India, other parts of South Asia, and Mexico highlight the imminent damage that will result from continued global warming unless serious and significant measures are taken.' According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), there is an 80% probability that the global average annual surface temperature will exceed pre-industrial levels by more than 1.5 degrees at least once in the next five years, exceeding the global warming limit set in the Paris Agreement.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2024 05:59 PM\nSource:[ondacero.es](https://www.ondacero.es/noticias/medio-ambiente/tierra-encadena-doce-meses-record-calor-oms-lanza-seria-advertencia_2024060566608b62f4db14000111ee98.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014including climate modeling, operational meteorology, climate science, and statistical analysis\u2014there is strong consensus that while 2025 will almost certainly rank among the top three warmest years globally, the probability that it will surpass 2024 as the warmest year on record according to ECMWF/Copernicus is low. Key factors considered by all experts include: (1) the transition from a strong El Ni\u00f1o (which helped produce records in 2023 and 2024) to neutral or La Ni\u00f1a conditions, which typically brings a slight global cooling or reduced anomaly; (2) persistent and record-high ocean heat content and marine heatwaves, which provide upward pressure on global temperatures and keep 2025 anomalously warm; (3) the ongoing effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases, driving a strong warming trend; (4) the rarity, as established by historical base rates, of three consecutive global annual record-warm years except in highly unusual circumstances; and (5) empirical monthly and seasonal temperature data for 2025 so far, showing it is closely tracking but slightly below 2024's pace. Multiple experts highlighted that while regional and oceanic extremes remain exceptional in 2025, the evidence (as of September) from real-time data, reanalyses, and expert commentary (such as from Copernicus, NOAA, Berkeley Earth, and climate scientists like Zeke Hausfather) points to a record in 2025 being 'very unlikely.' Forecast probabilities ranged between 10\u201324%, with most clustering around 12\u201321%, reflecting residual uncertainty in possible late-year surges, oceanic or atmospheric anomalies, or unforeseen feedbacks. All forecast scenarios for a Yes outcome would require unexpected warming spikes in late 2025, which are not currently supported by observed data or forecast models. No scenarios anticipate major cooling from volcanic/aerosol events. Overall, the experts agree that a new all-time global record in 2025 is possible but not probable, and that the status quo (2024 remaining the record-holder) is strongly favored based on all current indications.",
