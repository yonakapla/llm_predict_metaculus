Turnout models suggest that New York City\u2019s changing demographics and progressive movement activism will yield net-positive participation for Mamdani compared to the diffused, fractured adversarial field. Although elite and establishment hesitation remains, it does not translate into a credible alternative coalition, and most party infrastructure is coalescing behind him post-primary. Vote splitting among Adams, Cuomo, and Sliwa further dilutes the opposition. In the absence of a significant black swan event, the underlying fundamentals, voter alignments, ballot mechanics, and reinforced polling consensus make a Mamdani win highly probable, but not absolutely certain (small contingent probability for shock upsets, turnout anomalies, or last-minute unification behind a challenger).

Endorsements from establishment/labor continue to grudgingly move his way, and turnout from energetic progressive/Democratic base swamps tepid opposition, despite some moderate defection.

There are parallels with recent NYC and progressive urban insurgent victories, where establishment actors initially dither but ultimately fail to block an energetic outsider. Mamdani\u2019s progressive message is well-suited to key demographic groups with growing electoral clout, and the Democratic primary win cements his advantage in a heavily Democratic city. Top ballot placement and public endorsements offset partial institutional resistance. The opposition's failure to consolidate (and diminishing time to do so) is critical; Adams and Cuomo have both signaled intentions to stay despite pressures, making consolidation very unlikely. While moderate backlash could trim margins, there is scant evidence it will be enough to overcome the current lead absent a seismic event. The probability of a last-minute dramatic realignment or scandal sufficient to reverse the race is well below historical base rates for such contests. Therefore, a highly confident probability (but not maximal, as small probability black swans\u2014scandal, dropout, security incident\u2014always exist in dynamic city politics) is justified.",

Although Mamdani\u2019s foreign policy stances could erode margins in some communities, there is little evidence this would produce a sufficient base defection to overturn the Democratic baseline, especially with Sliwa splitting the non-left vote further.

The Republican (Sliwa) is polling in the high single digits to low teens, consistent with NYC history. While Mamdani's policies (notably his rhetoric about Netanyahu) spark controversy and may cost him a piece of the Jewish and pro-Israel vote, this bloc is typically insufficient, by itself, to deny the Democratic nominee victory. Furthermore, ballot position favors Mamdani, reducing risk of confusion or drop-off. In NYC electoral history, the only time the Democratic nominee has lost in the modern (post-1977) era was when the incumbent Democrat was deeply scandalized, the GOP candidate was exceptionally strong, or when there was major turnout aberration, none of which appears to apply here.

Identity-based backlash or elite hesitance could trim margins but would require coordinated action and dramatic voter realignment to alter the expected outcome. In practice, neither field events, polling, nor media coverage suggest such a coalition, and both opposition leaders are publicly set on staying. The residual probability for a disruptive late-development is arguably overstated here. Comparative cases (e.g., DSA incumbents, AOC, de Blasio after Weiner's scandal) all point to 'transformative' candidates maintaining their polling edge through November even amid establishment handwringing.

All additional evidence points to the same confluence of factors: fractured opposition, polling stability, base rates heavily favoring the Democratic nominee, and no signs of a structural reversal. Slightly higher estimates (up to 95%) from other forecasters are justified, but there are still marginal, nonzero black swan risks.

Defenses of slightly higher probabilities (92-95%) further underscore that, absent a black swan, Mamdani's defeat is implausible. Re-evaluating my balancing of theoretical late-game risk and the extraordinary polling/structural strength for the Democratic nominee, I now judge >93% to be warranted. This moves my probability up to align more with the informed consensus and current field dynamics, allowing only for very minor residual risk.",

Critiques of my more conservative estimate highlighted that my weighting of potential backlash and late realignment was excessive given NYC\u2019s entrenched partisan structure, the polling margin, and the empirical record for similar races. Several references to previous elections (de Blasio 2013, AOC, Dinkins, etc.) also support a higher probability, even for polarizing or insurgent Democrats. The collective evidence and expert calibration suggest that my initial estimate placed unnecessary emphasis on low-probability scenarios and that the current race structure merits a stronger, more extreme probability based on both theory and empirics.",

No new evidence or argument emerged that raised the probability of a late surge, anti-Mamdani consolidation, or that polling is systemically misrepresenting underlying voter intention to a degree that would affect result.

A Marist poll released on September\u202f16 shows Mamdani leading former Gov. Andrew\u202fCuomo by 21\u202fpercentage points in a four\u2011way race that also includes Republican nominee Curtis\u202fSliwa and Adams. John\u202fWhitlow, a law professor at City University of New\u202fYork, writes in The\u202fNation that New\u202fYork City is the epicenter of a political and economic battle between Trump\u2019s \u201cbrand of despotism,\u201d rooted in 1980s real\u2011estate politics, and Mamdani\u2019s \u201cdemocratic socialism.\u201d Whitlow calls Trump\u2019s labeling of Mamdani a \u201ccommunist\u201d inaccurate, noting that Mamdani identifies as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d in the vein of Bernie\u202fSanders and Alexandria\u202fOcasio\u2011Cortez. Whitlow argues that Trump\u2019s real\u2011estate background\u2014acquiring Manhattan land after the 1970s fiscal crisis\u2014provides a \u201cthrough line\u201d to his governance style, and that Mamdani\u2019s housing platform threatens the neoliberal compact that has dominated the city\u2019s economy since the 1970s.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/the-right-wing/trump-mamdani-nyc/)\n\n**NY Democratic Party chair not endorsing Mamdani**\nNew York Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs announced on Thursday that he will not endorse Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. Jacobs said, 'Mr. Mamdani and I are in agreement that America's greatest problem is the continued growth of income disparity in our nation,' but added, 'On how to address it -- we fundamentally disagree.' He also criticized the \u2018fear mongering\u2019 around Mamdani\u2019s campaign and his views on Israel, stating that the Democratic Socialists of America does not represent the Democratic Party\u2019s principles. Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary in a surprise victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, has been a vocal critic of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and has threatened to order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visits the city. Jacobs\u2019 decision follows Governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s endorsement of Mamdani, who praised his \u2018can\u2011do spirit\u2019 while noting disagreements on policy. Neither Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Mamdani, despite meeting with him. New York State Senator Mike Gianaris called Jacobs\u2019 refusal to endorse \u2018disgraceful\u2019 in a post on X, questioning the party leader\u2019s role.

Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani earlier this week, but Schumer and Jeffries have yet to publicly endorse him. Liz Hohenberger of Our Revolution said the petition drive aims to \"over the line\" to secure endorsement: 'We're delivering over 85,000 petition signatures asking for Senator Schumer and Representative Jeffries to honor the primary elections and endorse the democratically elected nominee Zohran Mamdani for New\u202fYork City mayor.' Jeffries declined to comment, saying he would speak later. Schumer met with Mamdani last week and said, 'we had a very good conversation. We know each other well, and those conversations are continuing.' Polls show Mamdani with a double\u2011digit lead over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with the Republican candidate in third place and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams in fourth. The petition has drawn support from figures such as Alexandria Ocasio\u2011Cortez and Bernie Sanders, while others like Rep. Tom Suozzi oppose Mamdani: 'Sometimes change is more important than unity. And I think that the Democrats, we have to work on our brand. And I think that the message that Mr. Mamdani is standing for is not something that I agree with.' Trump criticized Hochul\u2019s endorsement on Truth Social, calling Mamdani a \"Liddle Communist\": 'Governor Kathy Hochul of New\u202fYork has endorsed the 'Liddle' Communist, Zohran Mamdani, running for Mayor of New\u202fYork.'

State Governor Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have endorsed Mamdani, giving him the backing of two of the state\u2019s most powerful Democrats. However, congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have been more cautious. Schumer said he met with Mamdani for a \u2018good conversation,\u2019 while Jeffries downplayed any concerns. Smikle, a longtime Democratic strategist, noted that \u2018the calculus for Hochul and Heastie\u2026is to find a way to embrace the movement he\u2019s created.\u2019 Hochul said, \u2018New York State and New York City are at our best when we stand together against those who attempt to tear us apart.\u2019 Heastie described Mamdani as an optimist promising a better direction for the city. Mamdani echoed the call for unity, saying, \u2018This is a time for unity. It is a time for strength, and it is a time to speak in one voice.\u2019 The article also mentions that the MTA lost nearly $1\u202fbillion in 2024 due to toll and fare evasion, and that Mamdani plans to make public transit free. With about a month and a half before Election Day, the endorsements and the poll suggest growing momentum for Mamdani, though key Democratic leaders remain hesitant.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 05:43 PM\nSource:[nbcconnecticut.com](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/politics/zohran-mamdani-new-york-democrats-chuck-schumer-hakeem-jeffries/3639539/)\n\n**NY Poll Monitor: What to Expect from the Zohran\u202fMamdani vs. Andrew\u202fCuomo Showdown**\nAccording to the article, the race for New\u202fYork City mayor is shaping up as one of the most intense political battles in recent years.

I respect their decisions and support the team of Zohran Mamdani for Mayor,' he said. 'Though Assemblyman Mamdani and I have some serious differences on certain policies, I look forward to working with him to help New York City succeed and thrive.'

A Data for Progress poll found that Democratic voters rate elected officials who describe themselves as democratic socialists about as positively as those who identify as Democrats, and that they prefer democratic socialism to capitalism when given written definitions. Nate\u202fSilver noted that Zohran\u202fMamdani\u2019s lead in the New\u202fYork City mayoral race is roughly 19 points \u2013 a margin that, given a 20\u2011point error range, gives him a 95\u202f% chance of winning. The report also reports that New\u202fYork City Mayor Kathy\u202fHochul\u2019s endorsement would pressure other high\u2011profile Democrats, such as House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck\u202fSchumer, to support Mamdani. In Georgia, the governor announced plans to run, while in Kentucky a candidate from the Transwestern real\u2011estate firm is positioning himself as an outsider. The report cites a 53\u201147 loss for Trump in a recent primary, a 72\u201122 defeat for a Wisconsin governor, and a 42\u201116 loss for a long\u2011serving legislator in another state. In New\u202fJersey, Democratic nominee Mikie\u202fSherrill faces GOP nominee Jack\u202fCiattarelli in an upcoming debate. The report also includes a quote from a political commentator: 'Conservatives in Alabama do not believe that the people of California or Massachusetts should be allowed to make their own decisions about their children\u2019s education, or health care.' It highlights the crowded field in Connecticut\u2019s 1st District, where former Hartford Mayor Luke\u202fBronin has pledged to self\u2011fund $500,000, and notes that the state\u2019s ballot\u2011access rules could limit the number of signatures required. Finally, the report covers a Minnesota special election in District\u202f34B, where Democratic nominee Xp\u202fLee, a Hmong refugee, defeated Republican Ruth\u202fBittner 63\u201137 in the primary and faces her in the general election.

The current front-runner is Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old member of the New York State Assembly, who has been gaining ground on former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in recent polls. Mamdani, a Muslim candidate of Indian descent and Ugandan origin, is seen as a strong contender to become the first Muslim Mayor of New York City if he wins the primary election today. Mamdani represents the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which has been supportive of Palestine, while Cuomo represents the party's traditional wing and has been backed by pro-Israel lobbies. If Cuomo loses the primary election, he may run as an independent candidate in the general election on November 4. Current Mayor Eric Adams is not running in the primary election after facing criticism for his close ties to the Trump administration. The Republican Party has only one candidate, Curtis Sliwa, who is a radio host and the founder of the 'Guardian Angels' organization, which focuses on street safety. Sliwa is expected to face a strong Democratic opponent in the general election, given the city's demographics. In the primary election, voters can rank their top five choices, and if no candidate reaches 50% of the vote, the second-choice votes will be counted. Mamdani's campaign is seen as a strong contender in this system, especially if he can secure the second-choice votes of Brad Lander, another candidate.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 06:52 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/dunya/new-yorkta-demokrat-parti-belediye-baskan-adayi-icin-on-secim-yapiliyor/3611870)\n\n**From the vault: What burning questions do New Yorkers have for the next NYC mayor?**\nNew Yorkers were asked about their burning questions for the next city mayor ahead of the 2025 Democratic primary election mayoral debate.

The winner of the Democratic mayoral primary is typically the heavy favorite for the general election in overwhelmingly Democratic-leaning New York City, but this year's party nominee will face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who was elected as a Democrat but skipped Tuesday's primary to run as an independent in November.

    "date": "2025-09-20T01:05:54.938104",
    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a striking consensus that Zohran Mamdani is an overwhelming favorite to be elected Mayor of New York City in 2025. The experts\u2014drawing on disciplines including campaign strategy, polling analysis, NYC political history, urban sociology, political science, and American studies\u2014cite several common, reinforcing reasons for this high probability:\n\n1. **Historical Base Rates**: The Democratic nominee almost always wins NYC mayoral elections, and this general pattern still holds. Several experts cite post-WWII or post-1977 history, emphasizing the rarity of a non-Democrat or independent victory, except under extraordinary circumstances (e.g. scandal, massive party disunity).\n\n2. **Current Polling**: Multiple reputable public polls place Mamdani with a double-digit lead (19-21 points) over his closest rivals. All experts agree that at this stage of the campaign, this is a powerful signal, especially since NYC polling errors have historically been small.\n\n3. **Fragmented Opposition**: With Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo both running as independents after losing the Democratic primary, and Sliwa on the Republican line, the anti-Mamdani vote is sharply divided. This first-past-the-post system fragmentation makes it highly likely that Mamdani can win with a plurality, even below 50%.\n\n4. **Endorsements and Party Dynamics**: While Mamdani faces reluctance or outright withholding of endorsement from some top Democrats (e.g., Schumer, Jeffries, Jacobs), other key players (Governor Hochul, Assembly Speaker Heastie) have endorsed him. Experts assess the lack of full party unity as a slight to moderate risk, but conclude that it is not enough to overturn the base rate dominance of the Democratic nominee given the fractured field.\n\n5. **Mobilization and Enthusiasm**: Mamdani\u2019s campaign is powered by New York\u2019s activist, young, and progressive base, and his visibility as a South Asian Muslim democratic socialist is noted as energizing for new or previously less-mobilized voters\u2014though some experts caution this identity-driven enthusiasm could also spur moderate backlash, especially around his stance on Israel.\n\n6. **Potential Risks**: All experts allow for a slim chance that a major late-stage scandal, catastrophic gaffe, or unprecedented and sudden consolidation between anti-Mamdani forces (e.g., Adams/others withdrawing and endorsing Cuomo) could upset the race. However, they universally find no evidence of this happening in campaign signals, public statements, or current polling trends.\n\n7. **Scenario Planning**: The 'no' scenarios require unpredictable events: a dramatic field consolidation or a scandal\u2014neither of which seems likely or supported by current data. The 'yes' scenario is viewed as the base case: Mamdani's polling holds, the opposition remains divided, and normal patterns of turnout and party-line voting prevail.\n\n**Probabilities**: Most panelists assign probabilities in the 91\u201395% range, with a single outlier at 85% (citing somewhat more weight on identity backlash and establishment resistance). The modal forecast is 93\u201394%.\n\n**Conclusion**: The expert group converges overwhelmingly on a very high likelihood (low to mid-90s percentile) that Zohran Mamdani will be elected mayor of New York City in 2025, absent an unlikely dramatic late shift in the political environment.",
