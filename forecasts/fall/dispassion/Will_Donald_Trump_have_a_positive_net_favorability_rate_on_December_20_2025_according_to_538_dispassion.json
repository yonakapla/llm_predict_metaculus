Your forecast is thus methodologically rigorous and well-calibrated within the context of electoral forecasting models."

The historical absence of positive net favorability for Trump\u2014even during \"honeymoon\" periods\u2014supports a probability closer to 2-3%. Your argument is strengthened by the methodological reality that sampling variation, pollster house effects, and even rare outlier polls are unlikely to collectively overcome the entrenched negative baseline.

These Brutal New Polls Confirm It.**\nNew national polls from the Associated Press, Gallup, Quinnipiac, Reuters, and the Economist show Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating falling into the 30s, a steep decline from previous levels. The polling averages also reveal that Trump is performing poorly on key policy areas: his economy and trade ratings are in the 30s, and his immigration ratings are even lower. According to Lakshya Jain, co\u2011founder of Split Ticket and head of political data at The Argument, 'Trump is in a weak position' and the media and Democrats continue to portray him as strong. The article notes that Trump\u2019s recent high\u2011profile moments\u2014such as the failed Jimmy Kimmel ouster and the indictment of James Comey\u2014have flopped, further damaging his standing. The piece concludes that these polling trends have significant implications for the 2026 midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/201031/trump-weak-failing-president-brutal-new-polls-confirm-it)\n\n**Trump's approval ratings slide, with Americans angry over inflation and Jimmy Kimmel**\nAccording to Nate Silver\u2019s aggregate of U.S. national polls, President Donald Trump\u2019s net approval fell to \u20139.4 last week, a two\u2011point slide from the previous week and only slightly better than his lowest rating of \u201310.3 on July\u202f22. 53.1\u202f% of respondents disapprove of his performance, compared with 43.7\u202f% who approve. Trump\u2019s ratings on immigration (\u20135.3), the economy (\u201315.6) and trade (\u201317.3) have been stable, but his net approval on inflation (\u201330.0) has dropped six points since the end of August.  A YouGov poll cited by analyst G.\u202fElliott Morris found that 68\u202f% of Americans say it is \u2018unacceptable\u2019 for the government to pressure broadcasters to remove shows it disagrees with, compared with only 12\u202f% who say it is acceptable.  The S&P\u202f500 peaked last Monday at nearly\u202f6,700 points, up 2.8\u202f% over the last month.  The article also reports that Democrats held Arizona\u2019s 7th House district in a special election, that the UK Labour leadership contest is underway with the far\u2011right Reform party ahead in national polls, and that Victorian, New\u202fSouth\u202fWales and national polls show Labor leading the Coalition in most states.  In Victoria, a Redbridge poll gave Labor a 52\u201148\u202f% lead, while a DemosAU poll gave the Coalition a 51\u201149\u202f% lead.  In New\u202fSouth\u202fWales, the Resolve poll gave Labor a 38\u202f% primary vote versus 28\u202f% for the Coalition.  A national Morgan poll gave Labor a 55.5\u201144.5\u202f% lead, and Newspoll aggregate data from July to September showed Labor ahead 57\u201143\u202f% nationally.  The article concludes that Trump\u2019s ratings are unlikely to deteriorate further unless there is a major economic downturn or stock\u2011market collapse.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 06:36 AM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/trumps-approval-ratings-slide-with-americans-angry-over-inflation-and-jimmy-kimmel-265388)\n\n**Lee\u202fJae\u2011myung\u2019s Approval Rating Falls to 52.0\u202f% Amid Tariff Negotiation Challenges**\nAccording to a Realmeter poll conducted from 22\u201326 September 2025 with 2,527 voters aged 18 and older, President Lee\u202fJae\u2011myung\u2019s approval of his performance fell to 52.0\u202f%\u2014a 1.0\u2011point drop from the previous week. 44.1\u202f% of respondents judged his performance negatively, up 0.5\u202fpoints.  The decline is attributed to market anxiety over U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump\u2019s tariff pressure and the stalled U.S.\u2013South Korea tariff negotiations, as noted in the article.  Regionally, support was lowest in Busan, Ulsan and Gyeongnam (44.3\u202f%, 4.5\u202fpoints lower) and highest in Daegu and Gyeongbuk (45.1\u202f%, 4.8\u202fpoints higher).  Age\u2011group analysis showed a decline in the 70\u2011plus (39.4\u202f%, 8.2\u202fpoints lower), 40\u2011s (65.4\u202f%, 2.0\u202fpoints lower) and 30\u2011s (46.4\u202f%, 1.4\u202fpoints lower), while the 60\u2011s (52.6\u202f%, 3.0\u202fpoints higher) and 20\u2011s (38.1\u202f%, 1.5\u202fpoints higher) rose.

Wildeford began forecasting in 2020, motivated by the COVID\u201119 pandemic, and initially made classic beginner mistakes such as extrapolating linear trends and underestimating the spread of the virus. He later adopted a \u2018nothing ever happens\u2019 approach, which he says is usually correct but fails when events actually occur. Wildeford credits humility and selective positioning for improving accuracy, noting that he now only takes positions when he believes the market lacks information that he can add.\n\nHe emphasizes the value of expert teams, citing his 2022 midterm collaboration with two demography and candidate\u2011position specialists. Their model predicted a stronger Democratic performance than conventional wisdom, though it fell short of winning the House. Wildeford\u2019s team\u2011building strategy involves maintaining a Rolodex of experts with proven track records, often sourced from Twitter or personal contacts, and using their aggregated insights to inform forecasts.\n\nAn example of his methodology is the US\u2011Iran scenario, where he and his network of Middle\u2011East experts correctly anticipated that a U.S. strike on Iran would likely succeed, echoing the 2020 Soleimani strike. He also discusses his \u2018nothing ever happens\u2019 stance, noting that prediction markets exhibit a systematic pro\u2011Yes bias: community averages for \u2018Yes\u2019 responses are consistently higher than actual outcomes.\n\nWildeford\u2019s current major \u2018No\u2019 positions include: no new country will adopt Bitcoin this year; Time\u2019s Person of the Year will not be AI, Pope Leo XIV, or Donald Trump; and he predicts that the Romanian presidential election will not follow typical polling patterns, a claim that proved incorrect.\n\nHe uses AI as a sanity\u2011checking tool but remains skeptical of AI\u2019s competitive forecasting capabilities, citing open\u2011source requirements for IMO Grand Challenge prizes. Wildeford concludes by advocating a steady, low\u2011risk approach, buying positions at 88\u201390\u202fcents when they should be 95\u202fcents, and stresses that most provocative predictions fail.\n\nKey metrics and quotes: Wildeford is ranked 3 of 17,645 on Metaculus; Polymarket has 57,034 readers; he started forecasting in 2020; his 2022 midterm team predicted Democrats would perform better than the 538 model; he says, 'I have a 'nothing ever happens' approach to forecasting, which is right most of the time but painfully wrong when things actually do happen.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 04:20 AM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/sponsored-post/top-political-forecaster-nothing-ever-happens)\n\n**Lee\u202fJae\u2011myung\u2019s Approval Rating Falls to 52.0\u202f% Amid Tariff Negotiation Challenges**\nAccording to a Realmeter poll conducted from 22\u201326 September 2025 with 2,527 voters aged 18 and older, President Lee\u202fJae\u2011myung\u2019s approval of his performance fell to 52.0\u202f%\u2014a 1.0\u2011point drop from the previous week. 44.1\u202f% of respondents judged his performance negatively, up 0.5\u202fpoints.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll from September\u202f5\u20119 reported 42\u202f% approval and 54\u202f% disapproval; the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes daily average as of September\u202f19 showed 43\u202f% approval and 54\u202f% disapproval; an Associated Press/NORC poll gave 39\u202f% approval and 60\u202f% disapproval; The Economist reported 39\u202f% favorable and 56\u202f% unfavorable; a Rasmussen Reports poll on September\u202f19 found 53\u202f% approval and 46\u202f% disapproval; a Morning Consult poll updated September\u202f15 showed 46\u202f% approval and 52\u202f% disapproval; and an American Research Group poll from August\u202f21 reported 38\u202f% approval and 59\u202f% disapproval.  Trump\u2019s current approval rate is higher than his final 2021 rating of 34\u202f% and his first\u2011term average of 41\u202f%.  Compared with past presidents, his approval sits near the lower end: Joe Biden 40\u202f%, Barack Obama 59\u202f%, Bill Clinton 66\u202f%, and others ranging from 24\u202f% (Richard Nixon) to 66\u202f% (Clinton).  The article notes that approval ratings are a \u2018simple measure, yet a very powerful one\u2019 (Gallup) and that partisan differences have widened over time, as Pew Research Center observes that \u201cPresidential approval ratings have always been partisan, with members of the president\u2019s party offering more positive assessments than those in the opposing party\u201d (Pew).  The piece remains largely factual, citing multiple polling sources and providing context without overt editorializing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 02:37 PM\nSource:[AZ Central](https://eu.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/09/20/donald-trumps-approval-rating/86249861007/)\n\n**Lee's approval rebounds to 59% on diplomacy in U.S. summit**\nGallup Korea surveyed 1,000 adults nationwide from Tuesday to Thursday and found President Lee Jae\u2011Myung\u2019s approval rating at 59\u202f%, up three percentage points from the previous week. Negative evaluations fell to 30\u202f%, with 11\u202f% withholding judgment. The rise was strongest among Democratic Party supporters and progressives, who gave a favorable rating in the 90\u202f% range, and among people in their 40s and 50s, who gave a favorable rating in the 70\u202f% range. Moderates gave a 62\u202f% favorable rating. Conservatives and People Power Party supporters remained largely negative, but disapproval dropped by about 10\u202fpercentage points to levels seen two weeks earlier. When asked why they viewed Lee positively, 21\u202f% cited diplomacy, the most common reason; 12\u202f% cited diplomacy as the reason for negative evaluations. Sixty\u2011eight percent of respondents answered that the Korea\u2011U.S. summit benefited national interests. Party support in the poll was 44\u202f% for the Democratic Party, unchanged from the previous week, and 23\u202f% for the People Power Party, down two points.

This decline is attributed to his political endorsements, weaker earnings growth at Tesla, and high-profile controversies. Other public figures with low favorability ratings include Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump, and Marco Rubio, while Joe Biden, JD Vance, and Gavin Newsom also have negative ratings. In contrast, Bernie Sanders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy have positive ratings, with Sanders at plus 11 points and Zelenskyy at plus 18 points. Pope Leo XIV has the highest favorability rating, with a net score of plus 46 points.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 08, 2025 05:11 AM\nSource:[Digitaliworld](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2025/08/musk-scores-lowest-us-favorability-in.html)\n\n**Donald Trump gets good news from most accurate pollster**\nAccording to the Issues & Insights/TIPP Poll, President Donald Trump's net favorability rating is even among American voters, with 45% viewing him favorably and 45% unfavorably. The poll, which has been the most accurate of this century, found that Trump's standing among voters has remained little changed from just over a month ago. However, Trump remains very popular with his own party, with 80% of Republicans having a favorable opinion of him. On the other hand, most Democrats continue to dislike Trump, with only 17% viewing him favorably and 76% unfavorably. Terry Jones, editor of Issues & Insights, noted that Trump's standing among voters edged up during the month of July, despite the tumultuous events that took place. Costas Panagopoulos, a professor of political science at Northeastern University, cautioned that a single poll should not be taken as definitive, but rather as a snapshot in time. Trump has written on Truth Social that his poll numbers have gone up significantly since the Jeffrey Epstein hoax was exposed, with some polls showing his approval rating at 90%, 92%, 93%, and 95% among Republicans.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 04, 2025 02:57 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-good-news-pollster-2108438)\n\n**Donald Trump's disapproval rating jumps: Honeymoon \"has gone\"**\nPresident Donald Trump's disapproval rating has increased to 57% in July, according to a YouGov poll, up from 52% in April.

Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11) with the highest name recognition and strongest favorability rating among Democratic candidates in the 2025 New Jersey governor's race. Sherrill was recognized by 70% of likely general election voters, with 41% viewing her favorably and 29% unfavorably, yielding a +12 net favorability rating. In contrast, the likely GOP nominee, Jack Ciattarelli, had the highest unfavorable rating of any candidate, with 36% viewing him unfavorably and only 40% viewing him favorably, resulting in a +4 net rating. Sherrill's (+12) and Gottheimer's (+13) net favorability ratings significantly outpaced Ciattarelli's (+4), despite tens of millions of dollars spent on Ciattarelli's behalf. Jorge Elorza, CEO of Democrats for Education Reform, stated, 'Democrats are ready to take the fight to Donald Trump's MAGA stooge Jack Ciattarelli this November.' The poll of 576 likely November general election voters was conducted by SurveyUSA and measured favorability ratings for the six Democratic candidates, the leading Republican candidate, and President Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 04:26 PM\nSource:[insidernj.com](https://www.insidernj.com/surveyusa-election-poll-shows-mikie-sherrill-with-highest-favorability-rating/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts, across a range of disciplines (Polling Methodology, Political Science, Sociology, Communication Studies), assign a very low probability\u2014generally between 2% and 5%\u2014that Donald Trump will have a positive net favorability rate on December 20, 2025, according to 538. Their analyses converge on several key points:\n\n- Trump\u2019s net favorability is currently negative in the 538 aggregate (typically -8 to -17), and has shown no recent upward momentum after a brief post-2024 election bounce (\u2018honeymoon\u2019 period), which never reached sustained positive territory.\n- The historical base rate for Trump achieving a positive net favorability in national aggregates is exceptionally low; he has not attained this since at least 2016, except for possibly one short-lived, post-election instance.\n- Structural factors such as deep partisan polarization, entrenched negative opinions, and methodological properties of 538\u2019s polling average (which dilutes outlier results and dampens rapid swings) all strongly decrease the probability of a positive net favorability.\n- Current polling trends show worsening favorability, with particular weakness on major issues like the economy, and with some evidence of eroding support among key groups (e.g., millennials, even some Republicans).\n- While a few experts note that an extraordinary, unforeseen event (such as a major international crisis, bipartisan legislative win, or total opposition meltdown) could, in theory, trigger a short-lived reversal, they emphasize that such events are rare and would need to produce a massive, sustained shift in public opinion across multiple polling firms to affect the 538 average on the specific date.\n- Minor upward effects (like polling anomalies or holiday non-response biases) are possible but considered extremely unlikely to overcome the deeply negative baseline.\n\nIn summary, forecasters nearly all see the most likely outcome as Trump maintaining a negative net favorability on December 20, 2025, with only a slim chance of a technical or flash-in-the-pan positive result driven by black-swan events or briefly skewed polling. Their median forecast for the probability of a positive net favorability is approximately 2-3%.",
