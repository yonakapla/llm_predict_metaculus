Thus, though your reasoning is strong, your estimate may be slightly too high if we rigorously apply model-based status quo-weighting."

The only nuance I would add is that even in the event of a black-swan rally-around-the-flag event, the negative polarization effect is so strong that any gains would likely be both brief and muted.

These Brutal New Polls Confirm It.**\nNew national polls from the Associated Press, Gallup, Quinnipiac, Reuters, and the Economist show Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating falling into the 30s, a steep decline from previous levels. The polling averages also reveal that Trump is performing poorly on key policy areas: his economy and trade ratings are in the 30s, and his immigration ratings are even lower. According to Lakshya Jain, co\u2011founder of Split Ticket and head of political data at The Argument, 'Trump is in a weak position' and the media and Democrats continue to portray him as strong. The article notes that Trump\u2019s recent high\u2011profile moments\u2014such as the failed Jimmy Kimmel ouster and the indictment of James Comey\u2014have flopped, further damaging his standing. The piece concludes that these polling trends have significant implications for the 2026 midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/201031/trump-weak-failing-president-brutal-new-polls-confirm-it)\n\n**Trump's approval ratings slide, with Americans angry over inflation and Jimmy Kimmel**\nAccording to Nate Silver\u2019s aggregate of U.S. national polls, President Donald Trump\u2019s net approval fell to \u20139.4 last week, a two\u2011point slide from the previous week and only slightly better than his lowest rating of \u201310.3 on July\u202f22. 53.1\u202f% of respondents disapprove of his performance, compared with 43.7\u202f% who approve. Trump\u2019s ratings on immigration (\u20135.3), the economy (\u201315.6) and trade (\u201317.3) have been stable, but his net approval on inflation (\u201330.0) has dropped six points since the end of August.  A YouGov poll cited by analyst G.\u202fElliott Morris found that 68\u202f% of Americans say it is \u2018unacceptable\u2019 for the government to pressure broadcasters to remove shows it disagrees with, compared with only 12\u202f% who say it is acceptable.  The S&P\u202f500 peaked last Monday at nearly\u202f6,700 points, up 2.8\u202f% over the last month.  The article also reports that Democrats held Arizona\u2019s 7th House district in a special election, that the UK Labour leadership contest is underway with the far\u2011right Reform party ahead in national polls, and that Victorian, New\u202fSouth\u202fWales and national polls show Labor leading the Coalition in most states.  In Victoria, a Redbridge poll gave Labor a 52\u201148\u202f% lead, while a DemosAU poll gave the Coalition a 51\u201149\u202f% lead.  In New\u202fSouth\u202fWales, the Resolve poll gave Labor a 38\u202f% primary vote versus 28\u202f% for the Coalition.  A national Morgan poll gave Labor a 55.5\u201144.5\u202f% lead, and Newspoll aggregate data from July to September showed Labor ahead 57\u201143\u202f% nationally.

Wildeford began forecasting in 2020, motivated by the COVID\u201119 pandemic, and initially made classic beginner mistakes such as extrapolating linear trends and underestimating the spread of the virus. He later adopted a \u2018nothing ever happens\u2019 approach, which he says is usually correct but fails when events actually occur. Wildeford credits humility and selective positioning for improving accuracy, noting that he now only takes positions when he believes the market lacks information that he can add.\n\nHe emphasizes the value of expert teams, citing his 2022 midterm collaboration with two demography and candidate\u2011position specialists. Their model predicted a stronger Democratic performance than conventional wisdom, though it fell short of winning the House. Wildeford\u2019s team\u2011building strategy involves maintaining a Rolodex of experts with proven track records, often sourced from Twitter or personal contacts, and using their aggregated insights to inform forecasts.\n\nAn example of his methodology is the US\u2011Iran scenario, where he and his network of Middle\u2011East experts correctly anticipated that a U.S. strike on Iran would likely succeed, echoing the 2020 Soleimani strike. He also discusses his \u2018nothing ever happens\u2019 stance, noting that prediction markets exhibit a systematic pro\u2011Yes bias: community averages for \u2018Yes\u2019 responses are consistently higher than actual outcomes.\n\nWildeford\u2019s current major \u2018No\u2019 positions include: no new country will adopt Bitcoin this year; Time\u2019s Person of the Year will not be AI, Pope Leo XIV, or Donald Trump; and he predicts that the Romanian presidential election will not follow typical polling patterns, a claim that proved incorrect.\n\nHe uses AI as a sanity\u2011checking tool but remains skeptical of AI\u2019s competitive forecasting capabilities, citing open\u2011source requirements for IMO Grand Challenge prizes. Wildeford concludes by advocating a steady, low\u2011risk approach, buying positions at 88\u201390\u202fcents when they should be 95\u202fcents, and stresses that most provocative predictions fail.\n\nKey metrics and quotes: Wildeford is ranked 3 of 17,645 on Metaculus; Polymarket has 57,034 readers; he started forecasting in 2020; his 2022 midterm team predicted Democrats would perform better than the 538 model; he says, 'I have a 'nothing ever happens' approach to forecasting, which is right most of the time but painfully wrong when things actually do happen.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 04:20 AM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/sponsored-post/top-political-forecaster-nothing-ever-happens)\n\n**Lee\u202fJae\u2011myung\u2019s Approval Rating Falls to 52.0\u202f% Amid Tariff Negotiation Challenges**\nAccording to a Realmeter poll conducted from 22\u201326 September 2025 with 2,527 voters aged 18 and older, President Lee\u202fJae\u2011myung\u2019s approval of his performance fell to 52.0\u202f%\u2014a 1.0\u2011point drop from the previous week. 44.1\u202f% of respondents judged his performance negatively, up 0.5\u202fpoints.

Scholars quoted in the piece highlight that the Great Recession and the pandemic are the two most significant events shaping millennial attitudes, and that rising prices, vaccine\u2011access policies, and housing affordability are key concerns.  Heath Brown of City University of New York said, 'The two most significant events for many millennials are the Great Recession and the Pandemic.'  Mark Shanahan of the University of Surrey added, 'A lot of younger voters, including many independents and others, especially young men who don't generally exercise their democratic prerogative, leant Trump their vote in 2024 on the promise of an upturn in the economy and that they'd feel better off personally.

See the most recent polls**\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s recent policy moves\u2014unveiling a $1\u202fmillion \u2018gold card\u2019, raising H\u20111B fees, signing a Memphis Safe Task Force memorandum, and announcing a $100\u202f000 fee for H\u20111B visa\u2011seeking companies\u2014have coincided with a dip in his approval ratings.  According to a Real Clear Polling average of September\u202f6\u201118, 46.3\u202f% of respondents approve of Trump while 52.6\u202f% disapprove.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll from September\u202f5\u20119 reported 42\u202f% approval and 54\u202f% disapproval; the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes daily average as of September\u202f19 showed 43\u202f% approval and 54\u202f% disapproval; an Associated Press/NORC poll gave 39\u202f% approval and 60\u202f% disapproval; The Economist reported 39\u202f% favorable and 56\u202f% unfavorable; a Rasmussen Reports poll on September\u202f19 found 53\u202f% approval and 46\u202f% disapproval; a Morning Consult poll updated September\u202f15 showed 46\u202f% approval and 52\u202f% disapproval; and an American Research Group poll from August\u202f21 reported 38\u202f% approval and 59\u202f% disapproval.  Trump\u2019s current approval rate is higher than his final 2021 rating of 34\u202f% and his first\u2011term average of 41\u202f%.  Compared with past presidents, his approval sits near the lower end: Joe Biden 40\u202f%, Barack Obama 59\u202f%, Bill Clinton 66\u202f%, and others ranging from 24\u202f% (Richard Nixon) to 66\u202f% (Clinton).  The article notes that approval ratings are a \u2018simple measure, yet a very powerful one\u2019 (Gallup) and that partisan differences have widened over time, as Pew Research Center observes that \u201cPresidential approval ratings have always been partisan, with members of the president\u2019s party offering more positive assessments than those in the opposing party\u201d (Pew).  The piece remains largely factual, citing multiple polling sources and providing context without overt editorializing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 02:37 PM\nSource:[AZ Central](https://eu.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/09/20/donald-trumps-approval-rating/86249861007/)\n\n**Lee's approval rebounds to 59% on diplomacy in U.S. summit**\nGallup Korea surveyed 1,000 adults nationwide from Tuesday to Thursday and found President Lee Jae\u2011Myung\u2019s approval rating at 59\u202f%, up three percentage points from the previous week.

The poll, which has been the most accurate of this century, found that Trump's standing among voters has remained little changed from just over a month ago. However, Trump remains very popular with his own party, with 80% of Republicans having a favorable opinion of him. On the other hand, most Democrats continue to dislike Trump, with only 17% viewing him favorably and 76% unfavorably. Terry Jones, editor of Issues & Insights, noted that Trump's standing among voters edged up during the month of July, despite the tumultuous events that took place. Costas Panagopoulos, a professor of political science at Northeastern University, cautioned that a single poll should not be taken as definitive, but rather as a snapshot in time. Trump has written on Truth Social that his poll numbers have gone up significantly since the Jeffrey Epstein hoax was exposed, with some polls showing his approval rating at 90%, 92%, 93%, and 95% among Republicans.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 04, 2025 02:57 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-good-news-pollster-2108438)\n\n**Donald Trump's disapproval rating jumps: Honeymoon \"has gone\"**\nPresident Donald Trump's disapproval rating has increased to 57% in July, according to a YouGov poll, up from 52% in April.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014including polling methodology, question wording, political and voter behavior, partisan polarization, sociology, and media/communication studies\u2014there is a strong consensus that Donald Trump is highly unlikely to have a positive net favorability on FiveThirtyEight as of December 20, 2025. Experts point to the following key factors: (1) Persistent and increasing partisan polarization, leading to entrenched views and low volatility; (2) Strong and negative historical base rates, with Trump almost never having a positive net favorability even during 'honeymoon' periods; (3) Recent polling trends that show declining or stagnant net favorability, with current aggregates between -7 and -17; (4) Ongoing negative media framing, high issue salience of unpopular topics (like inflation or scandals), and little evidence of a possible positive reframing; (5) The structure and weighting methodology of FiveThirtyEight aggregates, which buffer against outlier swings unless a massive, sustained shift occurs; and (6) The low probability of a dramatic exogenous event (rally-around-the-flag, economic miracle, or opposition disaster) that could suddenly improve Trump's favorability. While noise or one-off shocks could, in theory, push the net favorability to zero or above for a day, the odds are assessed as extremely low, with expert probabilities clustering at 2\u20134%. The overwhelming expectation is that Trump\u2019s net favorability will remain negative on the resolution date.",
