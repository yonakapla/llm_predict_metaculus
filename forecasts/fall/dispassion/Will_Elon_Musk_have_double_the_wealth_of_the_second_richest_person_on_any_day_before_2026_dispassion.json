The emergence of new ultra-wealthy individuals (e.g., Tether's Devasini) lifts the #2's floor, making a 2x gap even less likely. While there have been exceptional days (Ellison +$101B in a day), the likelihood of Musk's net worth doubling the #2 on any given day before 2026 is extremely small barring an unprecedented, idiosyncratic event. As an ultra high net worth advisory specialist, I see no near-term mechanism or precedent that would make such a divergence plausible except for a sudden, unpredictable shock\u2014a scenario that remains in the low single-digit percentage range.",

The forecaster also correctly points out that new entrants such as Tether executives actually decrease, rather than increase, the likelihood of a 2x gap.

In practice, large single-day swings are more common for public equities than for private company valuations, which are typically only revalued on news or financing events. This means that a sudden, enormous swing in Musk's wealth would almost certainly require a public equity event\u2014something that would, in all likelihood, also impact his closest rivals due to sectoral correlations. Additionally, the forecaster could give more weight to the fact that reporting lags and methodologies (especially for philanthropic pledges like Ellison's) usually prevent abrupt drops in reported net worth. Thus, even in the event of a black swan, the practical reporting mechanics make a one-day 2x gap almost prohibitively difficult to achieve.

If successful, the company\u2019s valuation could rise to roughly $500\u202fbillion, putting it in the same league as SpaceX and OpenAI. The stablecoin issued by Tether currently has a circulating market cap of $172\u202fbillion, just behind Circle\u2019s USDC at $74\u202fbillion. Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates that a $500\u202fbillion valuation would boost chairman D'Vasi\u2019s net worth to $224\u202fbillion, making him the world\u2019s fifth\u2011richest person after Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos. CEO Ardoino and former CEO Fang Junzhe would each be close to $95\u202fbillion, entering the global top\u201120 richest list. Fang Junzhe, described as a \u2018Taiwanese son\u2011in\u2011law\u2019, is Dutch, studied Chinese at National Taiwan Normal University, and is the CEO of Bitfinex, a sister company of Tether under iFinex.

However, his lead is narrowing as Larry Ellison, the 81-year-old founder of Oracle, is now closing in on him. Ellison's personal wealth has increased by $100 billion since January, largely due to the surge in Oracle's stock price (+50% since the beginning of the year), driven by the growth of cloud and artificial intelligence. Ellison still owns 41% of Oracle's capital. Meanwhile, Elon Musk has lost $57 billion, mainly due to the decline in Tesla's stock price. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, completes the top three, while Jeff Bezos falls to fourth place. Bernard Arnault, the first Frenchman in the ranking, is now ninth with $157 billion.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 19, 2025 07:09 PM\nSource:[Europe 1](https://www.europe1.fr/international/elon-musk-reste-lhomme-le-plus-riche-du-monde-mais-pour-combien-de-temps-encore-769505)\n\n**Elon Musk Tops List of World's Richest People with $372 Billion Net Worth**\nAccording to the Bloomberg list of billionaires, as of August 17, 2025, Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has topped the list with a net worth of $372 billion.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts, across diverse backgrounds in finance, economics, and business strategy, converge on a very low probability (2-3%) that Elon Musk will have double the wealth of the world\u2019s second richest person on any day before 2026. Their analyses emphasize that although billionaire net worths\u2014especially tech and crypto fortunes\u2014are volatile and can experience large, sudden daily swings, the magnitude required for Musk to double his nearest rival (currently Larry Ellison or a new entrant like a Tether executive) is historically unprecedented except for rare cases such as Bill Gates in 1999. Key factors lowering the probability include: historical base rates showing 2x dominance as exceptionally rare; current leader board competition (several individuals near Musk, all driven by correlated tech sector dynamics); and the emergence of new challengers (as with the Tether scenario) keeping the #2 spot well above half of Musk's fortune. Slight increases in probability are conceded for the possibility of extraordinary, idiosyncratic events\u2014such as a massive and sudden spike in Tesla or SpaceX value, or the catastrophic collapse or divestment of the second-richest\u2019s assets\u2014but such events are considered black swans. Most plausible scenarios have wealth rankings continuing to move in tandem, making a 2x gap unlikely. In summary, barring a highly improbable combination of a Musk asset surge and simultaneous rival collapse, the experts find the likelihood to be very low but not strictly zero due to the ever-present chance of market anomalies.",
