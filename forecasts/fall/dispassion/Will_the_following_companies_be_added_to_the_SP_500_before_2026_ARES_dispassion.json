The crowded field of eligible candidates means ARES will compete directly with tech, fintech, and energy firms, which the Committee may prioritize for thematic or sector reasons, especially given ongoing AI and fintech enthusiasm. The September 2025 rebalance passed over ARES, but the December rebalance (or interim changes if a constituent is dropped) remains a live window. Historically, only a handful of eligible candidates are added per year, and not all well-qualified asset managers have made it in promptly.

All three hit intraday record highs, with the S&P 500 and DJIA closing at fresh all-time highs, while the Nasdaq-100 declined below Thursday\u2019s peak. The rally was driven by strong investor enthusiasm for AI-related stocks, fueled by OpenAI\u2019s $500 billion valuation\u2014making it the most valuable startup in history\u2014and new AI partnerships. However, the Nasdaq-100 was pressured by declines in key tech names: Palantir (PLTR) dropped 7.5% after a Reuters report revealed internal U.S. Army concerns over security flaws in its battlefield communications platform, though Palantir refuted the claims, stating the issues were resolved. Meta (META) fell due to product demo failures and safety concerns, Netflix (NFLX) declined amid a consumer boycott, and Applied Materials (AMAT) dropped after revising its revenue outlook, projecting a $110 million hit in Q4 and $600 million in fiscal 2026 due to export restrictions. Despite these setbacks, Nvidia (NVDA) became the first U.S. public company to reach a $4.5 trillion market cap, with Cantor Fitzgerald projecting it could exceed $10 trillion as AI infrastructure spending accelerates. Meanwhile, the U.S. government shutdown\u2014now in its third day\u2014delayed the September nonfarm payrolls release, but markets remained unfazed. Private data sources like ADP reported a loss of 32,000 private-sector jobs in September, and the ISM Services index fell to 50, indicating stagnation. These reports reinforced expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, with futures markets signaling near-certainty for a cut in October and an 80% chance in December. BlackRock\u2019s Global Infrastructure Partners is in advanced talks to acquire Aligned Data Centers in a potential $40 billion deal. Google announced a $4 billion investment in a new AI and cloud data center in Arkansas, powered by solar and battery projects with Entergy Arkansas. Vertiv Holdings (VRT) surged on strong AI-driven demand for data center infrastructure, supported by partnerships like Hitachi and OpenAI. IBM continued its rally on quantum computing advancements, including deployments with HSBC and Vanguard, and launched new AI models and infrastructure partnerships. Tesla (TSLA) reported record Q3 deliveries, but the stock fell due to concerns over temporary demand spikes from pre-expiration tax credit buying and ongoing challenges in Europe and EV competition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 02:16 PM\nSource:[Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-week-that-was-the-week-ahead-macro-markets-october-5-2025-1035256698)\n\n**111 Capital Makes New Investment in Strategy Inc $MSTR**\n111 Capital made a new investment in Strategy Inc.

Key catalysts include AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) surging over 30% on a deal with OpenAI, potentially worth tens of billions in revenue, and Critical Metal Corp jumping 75% premarket on reports of a potential Trump administration equity stake in a Greenland rare earth project. Crypto stocks rose as Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $125,000, lifting Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Riot Platforms. The USD is strengthening, supported by a falling yen, while EUR/USD declines following French Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s resignation after 27 days, deepening France\u2019s political instability. GBP/USD is falling amid a weaker UK construction sector, with the September construction PMI at 46.2 (up from 45.5 but still below 50). Oil prices are rebounding after OPEC+ agreed to a 137,000 bpd output increase\u2014consistent with October\u2019s rise but higher than November\u2019s expected rise\u2014though weak demand fundamentals are expected to limit price gains. The increase comes amid rising Venezuelan exports, resumed Kurdish oil flows via Turkey, and unchanged official selling prices from Saudi Arabia.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 02:06 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-forecast-spx-rises-on-ai-boos-200668041)\n\n**Strategy (MSTR) Reports Significant Unrealized Gains on Digital Assets**\nStrategy Inc.

All three hit intraday record highs, with the S&P 500 and DJIA closing at fresh all-time highs, while the Nasdaq-100 declined below Thursday\u2019s peak. The rally was driven by strong investor enthusiasm for AI-related stocks, fueled by OpenAI\u2019s $500 billion valuation\u2014making it the most valuable startup in history\u2014and new AI partnerships. However, the Nasdaq-100 was pressured by declines in key tech names: Palantir (PLTR) dropped 7.5% after a Reuters report revealed internal U.S. Army concerns over security flaws in its battlefield communications platform, though Palantir refuted the claims, stating the issues were resolved. Meta (META) fell due to product demo failures and safety concerns, Netflix (NFLX) declined amid a consumer boycott, and Applied Materials (AMAT) dropped after revising its revenue outlook, projecting a $110 million hit in Q4 and $600 million in fiscal 2026 due to export restrictions. Despite these setbacks, Nvidia (NVDA) became the first U.S. public company to reach a $4.5 trillion market cap, with Cantor Fitzgerald projecting it could exceed $10 trillion as AI infrastructure spending accelerates. Meanwhile, the U.S. government shutdown\u2014now in its third day\u2014delayed the September nonfarm payrolls release, but markets remained unfazed. Private data sources like ADP reported a loss of 32,000 private-sector jobs in September, and the ISM Services index fell to 50, indicating stagnation. These reports reinforced expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, with futures markets signaling near-certainty for a cut in October and an 80% chance in December. BlackRock\u2019s Global Infrastructure Partners is in advanced talks to acquire Aligned Data Centers in a potential $40 billion deal. Google announced a $4 billion investment in a new AI and cloud data center in Arkansas, powered by solar and battery projects with Entergy Arkansas. Vertiv Holdings (VRT) surged on strong AI-driven demand for data center infrastructure, supported by partnerships like Hitachi and OpenAI. IBM continued its rally on quantum computing advancements, including deployments with HSBC and Vanguard, and launched new AI models and infrastructure partnerships. Tesla (TSLA) reported record Q3 deliveries, but the stock fell due to concerns over temporary demand spikes from pre-expiration tax credit buying and ongoing challenges in Europe and EV competition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 02:16 PM\nSource:[Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-week-that-was-the-week-ahead-macro-markets-october-5-2025-1035256698)\n\n**111 Capital Makes New Investment in Strategy Inc $MSTR**\n111 Capital made a new investment in Strategy Inc.

The company meets the size and other key criteria for inclusion, yet its market capitalization is largely derived from bitcoin holdings rather than its underlying information\u2011technology business. The strategists claim the exclusion could limit the influx of crypto assets into investor portfolios and may prompt other index providers to reconsider including similar corporate crypto treasuries. They also note that the Nasdaq has begun requiring shareholder approval for companies that use crypto assets to fund new share issuances. The article suggests that investors and index providers might shift their focus toward crypto firms with real operating businesses, such as exchanges or miners, rather than corporate treasuries. 'This is signaling that the committee, which can apply discretion in its index inclusion decisions, is concerned about including in the S&P 500 index companies such as MicroStrategy that are effectively bitcoin funds,' the strategists said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 10:14 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The additions will take effect on September 22, 2025. Seyffart also noted that MicroStrategy (MSTR) was not included in this round of additions, a decision attributed to the discretion of the S&P 500 committee. Balchunas explained, 'Why wasn\u2019t $MSTR allowed into the S&P 500 Index despite meeting all the criteria? Because the Committee said no.' The move highlights that meeting eligibility criteria does not guarantee inclusion.

The most recent quarter saw no updates, prompting speculation that the next reshuffle\u2014typically the largest because it incorporates annual float\u2011factor adjustments\u2014might bring new members.  Melissa Roberts, a managing director at Stephens, noted that the \"third\u2011quarter reshuffle is typically the largest rebalance because it includes annual constituent float\u2011factor changes,\" and that \"S&P Dow Jones Indices historically took advantage of the liquidity opportunity to make more discretionary changes than in other quarters.\"  To qualify for inclusion, a U.S.\u2011domiciled company must have a market capitalization of at least $22.7\u202fbillion, a float market capitalization of at least $10.25\u202fbillion, and demonstrate financial viability by being profitable on a GAAP basis in the most recent quarter and over the past four quarters.  Current candidates include AppLovin Corp. (APP), Reddit Inc. (RDDT), Pinterest Inc. (PINS), Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), Sofi Technologies Inc. (SOFI) and Carvana Co. (CVNA).  AppLovin, with a $164\u202fbillion market cap, is the largest eligible firm, while Strategy Inc. (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, has newly cleared the financial\u2011viability hurdle.  Other newly eligible names are Astera Labs Inc. (ALAB) and Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG), the latter having risen 42\u202f% in the last month.  Although Robinhood was expected to join, it was not selected in the last rebalance and remains the third\u2011largest eligible company not yet in the index.  Roberts suggests a fintech addition may be less likely this time, noting recent inclusions of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. (IBKR), Block Inc. (XYZ) and Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250905277/sp-500-changes-are-due-out-soon-and-this-could-be-a-big-update)\n\n**MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin Empire Rises, Sizing Up for S&P 500 Inclusion**\nMicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has built a Bitcoin\u2011backed empire that is now a serious candidate for inclusion in the S&P\u202f500.  The company\u2019s unrealized gains of $14\u202fbillion in the last quarter theoretically satisfy the index\u2019s profitability requirement.  If accepted, passive funds tracking the index would be forced to buy roughly 50\u202fmillion shares, worth about $16\u202fbillion at current prices, according to Stephens analysis.  MicroStrategy\u2019s market cap of $22.7\u202fbillion and its high liquidity ratio place it ahead of other potential candidates such as AppLovin, Robinhood and Carvana.  The S&P committee also considers industry balance, and the recent addition of Coinbase Global Inc. and Block Inc. signals growing acceptance of digital\u2011asset companies.  Saylor\u2019s strategy of raising debt and equity to purchase Bitcoin has drawn skepticism, especially after the company\u2019s stock fell 17\u202f% in August and its 30\u2011day volatility reached 96\u202f%, higher than Nvidia\u2019s 77\u202f% and Tesla\u2019s 74\u202f%.  Despite these risks, MicroStrategy\u2019s inclusion could trigger the so\u2011called \"index effect\" and attract passive inflows from large institutional investors.  Saylor has publicly suggested 2025 could be the year the company joins the S&P\u202f500.  \"\u7eb3\u5165Coinbase\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u6b32\u62d3\u5c55\u8be5\u884c\u4e1a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\" Stephens\u2019 managing director Melissa Roberts said, highlighting the committee\u2019s focus on industry representation.

As of June\u202f30, the company held 597,325\u202fBTC, and the Bitcoin\u2011yield since the start of the year was 19.7\u202f%, a key performance indicator that measures the change in the ratio of BTC held to the diluted number of shares.  In Q2\u202f2025, Strategy reported operating income of $14\u202fbillion and net profit of $10\u202fbillion, translating to $32.6 earnings per diluted share (EPS).  Quarterly revenue was $114.5\u202fmillion, a 2.7\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year increase, while subscription\u2011service revenue rose almost 70\u202f%.  The shift to fair\u2011value accounting in January\u202f2025 allowed the firm to recognize unrealised gains on its digital\u2011asset holdings, directly boosting profitability.  Management has raised its 2025 outlook to $34\u202fbillion operating income, $24\u202fbillion net profit and $80 EPS, assuming Bitcoin ends the year at $150,000.  With a market cap well above the $8.2\u202fbillion threshold, daily trading volume over 250,000 shares, more than 50\u202f% free float, and positive earnings for the last quarter and the trailing twelve months, Strategy meets all S&P\u202f500 eligibility criteria.  The next potential inclusion window is the September\u202f2025 rebalancing, with announcements expected on September\u202f5 and effective changes on September\u202f19.  If added, Strategy would be the first Bitcoin\u2011reserve\u2011holding company to enter the benchmark index, marking a significant milestone for digital\u2011asset integration into U.S. equities.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 01:02 AM\nSource:[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/ru/markets/2025/09/01/strategy-qualifies-for-s-and-p-500-inclusion-decision-could-come-on-friday)\n\n**Robinhood and Strategy Stocks Fall After Missing S&P 500 Inclusion**\nAccording to the article, Robinhood Markets (HOOD) and Bitcoin\u2011strategy firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) fell in after\u2011hours trading on Monday after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Interactive Brokers Group would join the S&P\u202f500, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance. Robinhood\u2019s shares closed the regular session down 1.26% and fell 0.5% to $107.40 in after\u2011hours, while Interactive Brokers rose 3.9% to $65.21 in extended trading after the inclusion announcement; the S&P\u202f500 itself fell 0.4%. MSTR closed the regular session down 4.17% and fell 0.6% to $341 in after\u2011hours, and Bitcoin slipped 2% after briefly falling below $110,000. The article notes that inclusion in the S&P\u202f500 is usually advantageous because passive investors and index funds will buy the shares, stating 'The inclusion in the S&P 500 is considered normally an advantage for a company.' It also lists the criteria for inclusion: market cap \u2265$22.7\u202fbillion, U.S. headquarters, listing on NYSE, NASDAQ or Cboe, and minimum liquidity and volume, quoting 'The inclusion of a company in the S&P 500 is a decision that a committee guided by a series of criteria.' Robinhood has risen nearly 190% year\u2011to\u2011date and set price records, but was rejected again; MicroStrategy had recently become eligible due to its Bitcoin holdings.

According to a Barron's report, both Robinhood Markets and AppLovin Corp are strong contenders to join the index, with market capitalizations of $93 billion and $123 billion, respectively. As investors bet on their potential inclusion, both stocks jumped in early trading, with Robinhood rising over 4% and AppLovin gaining over 3%. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the S&P 500 index, has a history of adding the largest companies not currently in the index, and has a pattern of replacing companies with ones in the same industry. As per Barron's analysis, technology and financials are underrepresented in the index, which could mean a tech or financial company will be added. Cheniere Energy, Carvana, and Ares Management are also potential candidates, but Cheniere might have a higher chance due to its similar market value to Hess and its position in the energy industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 18, 2025 03:37 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/robinhood-stock-news-hood-stock-news-will-robinhood-or-applovin-fill-the-open-spot-in-the-sp-500-index-after-chevron-hess-shakeup-sp500-latest-news/articleshow/122768014.cms)\n\n**AppLovin and Robinhood, Favorites to Join the S&P 500**\nAnalysts predict an increase in the weight of financial values in the market. The S&P 500 has returned to historical highs, with a 26.1% gain since April's lows. The index is slowly recovering positions, closing the gap with European selectives, but is still pending revisions to its composition, which will arrive by the end of the year. Companies that usually enter are the largest in smaller indices, but this unwritten rule leaves five companies on the sidelines, preparing to assault the S&P 500: AppLovin, Robinhood, Carvana, Ares Management, and Cheniere Energy. According to a KBW report, Interactive Brokers could also be a possible incorporation. The favorites are Robinhood and Ares Management, which have a higher chance of being incorporated due to the low weighting of financial sector actions in the index. The entrance to these indices is a boost for companies, increasing their visibility, as it is a common criterion among fund managers and ETFs when entering investment portfolios. KBW estimates that the entrance of these values would lead to a purchase of up to 113 million shares of Robinhood and 31.1 million titles of Ares.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 07, 2025 12:42 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/13452068/07/25/applovin-y-robinhood-a-la-cabeza-en-las-quinielas-para-ser-las-proximas-incorporaciones-en-el-sp-500.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters broadly agree that Ares Management (ARES) is a highly eligible and frequently cited candidate for S&P 500 inclusion before 2026, meeting all objective requirements such as market capitalization, liquidity, profitability, corporate structure, and sector fit. Key factors boosting ARES\u2019s probability are the S&P 500\u2019s current underweighting of financials (especially alternative asset managers) and consistent mentions by analysts and news sources as a leading contender in upcoming rebalances. Several forecasters note that sector representation pressures and passive fund flows support the case for ARES. However, most experts also highlight substantial uncertainty due to the S&P 500 committee\u2019s discretionary and sometimes unpredictable decision-making, citing recent high-profile examples (such as MicroStrategy) where technical eligibility did not guarantee inclusion. The competition for a limited number of available slots is stiff, with other prominent candidates (such as AppLovin, Robinhood, Carvana, and Cheniere) vying for inclusion, and the major September rebalance has already passed without ARES being selected. Most experts estimate the remaining opportunities will occur in the December rebalance or in response to unplanned constituent departures. Final probability estimates vary: the majority cluster between 35% and 75%, with the modal range from 40% to 72%, centering around 60-65% among finance and accounting experts, but somewhat lower (22-45%) among those emphasizing recent committee discretion, competition, or historical base rates post-major rebalance. Across all perspectives, ARES is seen as an above-base-rate candidate but far from a certainty, with odds that are meaningfully better than random, yet still reflecting the constraints of timing, discretion, and competition.",
