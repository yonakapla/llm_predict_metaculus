Despite the scientific drift, the CDC and other agencies remain conservative in public communications, and have not, as of October 2025, made such a declaration for any recent case. With only about two months remaining, and with CDC operations and surveillance capacity hampered by political and fiscal disruptions, the likelihood of a cluster arising, being thoroughly investigated, and resulting in an official CDC statement meeting the fine print before year-end is moderate but not high. The base rate for official reporting of zoonotic-to-human transition events is low, and the default is to attribute cases to animal exposure unless strong evidence exists.

However, I see no compelling new evidence that would sharply increase my initial probability, as operational disruptions and the lack of any public CDC report continue to weigh heavily. Given this, I will slightly revise my probability upward to better align with the upper end of the consensus for the current situation, reflecting both the increased biological plausibility and the persistent institutional and temporal barriers to official confirmation.",

However, as emphasized by both my own analysis and several other experts, the resolution requires an explicit CDC report of a specific human-to-human transmission event, which remains unprecedented in the current period and is constrained by operational and political headwinds. My critique of the moderate probabilities is that, despite increased biological plausibility, the CDC's procedural conservatism and the short time frame create a strong status quo bias. Still, the presence of multiple forecasts above 20% suggests a slight underweighting of the potential for a late-breaking report, especially given the large number of ongoing cluster investigations and the possibility of a retrospective CDC confirmation.

The study analyzed data from 10 reports identifying 18 asymptomatic H5N1 cases, including 2 with molecular and serologic confirmation (MSC) and 16 with molecular confirmation alone (MC). Two MSC cases were identified in adults in Pakistan and Vietnam through household contact investigations; one had exposure to infected poultry, while the other likely contracted the virus through human-to-human transmission, with no poultry contact. Of the 16 MC cases, 11 were found through enhanced surveillance of poultry-exposed individuals (8 in Bangladesh, 2 in Spain, 1 in the UK), and 5 were identified via contact tracing (3 in Vietnam, 2 in Cambodia). The authors emphasize the need for robust data collection from asymptomatic individuals to inform public health responses. In a related commentary, Rick Bright and Nicole Lurie note that since March 2024, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has spread among dairy cattle, with over 800 infected herds in at least 16 US states. As of mid-2025, approximately 70 human cases have been reported, mostly mild, with at least one death. High viral loads have been detected in raw milk, and live virus has been found in mammary tissue and milking equipment. Spillover to other mammals\u2014including cats, dogs, mice, wild carnivores, marine mammals, and swine\u2014has been documented. The authors challenge the traditional view that H5N1 infections in humans are always severe and that human-to-human transmission does not occur, calling attention to a critical gap in surveillance systems that focus on symptomatic illness rather than infection detection, and stressing the importance of investigating clusters for potential limited transmission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 07:16 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/review-human-h5n1-avian-flu-cases-can-be-asymptomatic-and-virus-likely)\n\n**Avian Influenza: The H9N2 Strain Could Trigger the Next Pandemic**\nThe H9N2 strain of avian influenza, previously considered less significant due to its mild effects in birds, may pose a greater pandemic risk than previously thought, according to researchers from the University of Hong Kong. Although global surveillance has focused on the highly lethal H5N1 virus, especially after its spread among dairy cows in North America, H9N2 has shown increased adaptation to infect humans. Since 1998, H9N2 has caused 173 human infections, primarily in China, according to Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong. The virus has undergone genetic changes since around 2015, making it more infectious to human cells\u2014evidenced by a 2024 sample infecting more human cells than a 1999 sample in laboratory tests. The modern strain also demonstrates improved binding to human respiratory tract receptors, suggesting adaptation for human transmission. Despite this, no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission has yet been found. Experts, including Gian Carlo Icardi from the University of Genova and Michelle Wille from the Peter Doherty Institute, stress the need for enhanced surveillance, particularly in mammals in close contact with birds, as genetic reassortment in co-infected animals could create new pandemic-capable strains. The current lack of mandatory reporting for low-pathogenicity strains like H9N2 hampers risk assessment. Researchers emphasize that ongoing global monitoring is essential to detect early signs of adaptation and prepare for potential future pandemics.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[lastampa.it](https://www.lastampa.it/salute/2025/10/29/news/influenza_aviaria_ceppo_minore_virus_pandemia-424945772/)\n\n**Video: Avian Influenza: Answers to the Most Important Questions About the New Disease**\nThe avian influenza (bird flu) has emerged as a new public health concern following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primarily affecting birds, the disease has now spread to other animals including cats and cows, and in rare cases, humans. The Robert Koch Institute confirms over 2,600 human cases worldwide since 2003, with the H5N1 variant causing particular concern; however, no human-to-human transmission has been documented. H5N1 cases are currently reported in Asia and the Americas, with outbreaks among dairy cows in the United States since March 2024. The virus has not yet been detected in Europe, but there is a potential risk of introduction via trade in cattle or beef products. Transmission occurs mainly through raw milk, not airborne routes. The risk to people working with animals is considered low to moderate. Symptoms include fever, cough, breathing difficulties, and in severe cases, pneumonia; gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting may also occur. Finland plans a vaccination campaign for high-risk groups, while Germany is not participating in the EU\u2019s vaccine procurement. Prevention includes consuming only pasteurized milk and thoroughly cooking meat. Treatment involves antiviral medications such as baloxavir, oseltamivir, or zanamivir, as antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections, according to the Science Media Center.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[RP Online](https://rp-online.de/leben/gesundheit/vogelgrippe-antworten-auf-die-wichtigsten-fragen-zur-neuen-krankheit_vid-117390457)\n\n**How Dangerous Are H5N1 Bird Flu Mutations for Humans?**\nThe H5N1 avian influenza virus, a highly contagious subtype of the Influenza A virus, is currently widespread in Germany and globally, primarily affecting birds such as cranes, but also found in various mammals including cats, bears, and seals. While human infections remain rare, with 992 confirmed cases worldwide according to the ECDC\u2014mostly in Asia, Turkey, Spain, the UK, and the US\u2014symptoms in humans range from mild eye or respiratory infections to severe pneumonia that can be fatal. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently assesses the risk to the general population as low, noting that the virus has not yet efficiently adapted to human cells. However, researchers warn that a single mutation\u2014such as the Q226L mutation\u2014could significantly enhance the virus's ability to bind to human receptors, potentially enabling human-to-human transmission. The risk of a pandemic remains low for now, but experts caution that if H5N1 were to co-infect a human with seasonal influenza, genetic reassortment could create a novel, transmissible strain, similar to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The virus has also recently infected cattle in the US, raising concerns about zoonotic transmission and the potential for contaminated raw milk to spread the virus to other livestock. While the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) considers the risk of transmission via imported dairy products as very low due to processing and lack of live cattle imports from the US, isolated cases in mammals\u2014such as an infected sheep in England\u2014have been reported, likely due to contact with contaminated equipment on farms with infected poultry. Authorities recommend avoiding direct contact with sick or dead wild birds and maintaining strict biosecurity measures in poultry and livestock farming.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 02:38 PM\nSource:[schwarzwaelder-bote.de](https://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/inhalt.vogelgrippe-pandemie-wie-gefaehrlich-ist-der-subtyp-h5n1-fuer-menschen.15a49190-ce80-4b1b-a578-aa061e0bac49.html)\n\n**Review: Human H5N1 avian flu cases can be asymptomatic, and the virus likely spreads among people**\nA scoping review by researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), published in JAMA Network Open on October 29, 2025, reveals that asymptomatic human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) occur and that person-to-person transmission is likely in certain settings.

Of these, 2 cases were molecularly and serologically confirmed (MSC), including an adult in Pakistan (2007) with possible human-to-human transmission from symptomatic siblings and an adult in Vietnam (2011) who handled infected chickens; both were seropositive and had no symptoms. The remaining 16 cases were confirmed by molecular testing alone (MC), including 14 adults and 2 children, mostly detected through enhanced surveillance in Bangladesh, Spain, the UK, and household contact investigations in Vietnam and Cambodia. Most MC cases had high RT-PCR cycle threshold values (>30), suggesting low viral load, and some were considered potentially due to environmental contamination. Only two enhanced surveillance programs reported denominator data, with detection rates of 1% and 4% among asymptomatic individuals with animal exposure. The review highlights that asymptomatic A(H5N1) infections are rare, and robust data collection\u2014including serial respiratory and serum sampling, detailed symptom monitoring, and postexposure prophylaxis tracking\u2014is critical to assess true infection rates, duration of viral shedding, and potential for transmission. The study concludes that current evidence is limited by lack of denominator data, inconsistent symptom ascertainment, and absence of serologic confirmation in most cases, underscoring the need for prospective surveillance to inform public health risk assessments and infection control strategies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840680)\n\n**Avian Influenza in Germany: Experts Warn of Risks Despite Low Human Threat**\nThe H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in Germany has caused thousands of cranes to die and led to the culling of tens of thousands of poultry to prevent further spread. Professor Christa K\u00fchn, President of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI), explains that this year's outbreak is unusual due to its early onset and the high visibility of affected cranes, which evoke public sympathy. While previous outbreaks occurred mainly in wild birds, this year the virus has also reached poultry farms. The virus, a mutating RNA virus, varies in aggressiveness, with severe outbreaks occurring in the early 2020s and summer 2023. Though the virus has infected cows in the U.S., no cases have been found in Germany despite intensive monitoring. Transmission among cows likely occurred via milk and milking equipment, not respiratory droplets. Human infection risk is considered low, with only 70 cases reported in the U.S. (mostly conjunctivitis), and no deaths directly linked to H5N1. K\u00fchn warns against handling dead birds and urges caution during the human flu season to avoid potential viral recombination. Although vaccines exist, they are problematic: they can allow silent virus circulation (impedance), require extensive monitoring, and have severe economic consequences\u2014e.g., France lost U.S. poultry export access after starting vaccinations. Culling remains the EU-mandated standard for infected poultry, as it is both legally required and ethically necessary to prevent animal suffering. Infected carcasses are incinerated; their meat is prohibited from consumption due to contamination risks during transport. The state's animal disease control measures prioritize stopping the spread of H5N1.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:58 AM\nSource:[DIE WELT](https://www.welt.de/gesundheit/article68fa199b59e2e09750709527/vogelgrippe-es-gibt-impfstoffe-doch-sie-sind-problematisch.html)\n\n**Avian Influenza: The H9N2 Strain Could Trigger the Next Pandemic**\nThe H9N2 strain of avian influenza, previously considered less significant due to its mild effects in birds, may pose a greater pandemic risk than previously thought, according to researchers from the University of Hong Kong.

The virus has undergone genetic changes since around 2015, making it more infectious to human cells\u2014evidenced by a 2024 sample infecting more human cells than a 1999 sample in laboratory tests. The modern strain also demonstrates improved binding to human respiratory tract receptors, suggesting adaptation for human transmission. Despite this, no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission has yet been found. Experts, including Gian Carlo Icardi from the University of Genova and Michelle Wille from the Peter Doherty Institute, stress the need for enhanced surveillance, particularly in mammals in close contact with birds, as genetic reassortment in co-infected animals could create new pandemic-capable strains. The current lack of mandatory reporting for low-pathogenicity strains like H9N2 hampers risk assessment. Researchers emphasize that ongoing global monitoring is essential to detect early signs of adaptation and prepare for potential future pandemics.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[lastampa.it](https://www.lastampa.it/salute/2025/10/29/news/influenza_aviaria_ceppo_minore_virus_pandemia-424945772/)\n\n**Navarre's Poultry Sector on Alert After First Case of Avian Influenza Detected**\nOn October 28, 2025, the Government of Navarra confirmed the first case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the region, detected in a dead crane found in a wetland in the municipality of Arguedas. The virus was confirmed by official laboratories and is consistent with strains previously identified in other parts of Spain during the autumn. Although the case occurred in a wild bird and not in a commercial poultry farm, it immediately triggered biosecurity and surveillance protocols established by the Ministry of Agriculture and regional authorities. All poultry farms in Navarra, especially those near wetlands or migratory bird routes, were urged to strengthen preventive measures. Navarra has over 500 poultry farms and 9 million birds, according to the Rural Development and Environment Department\u2019s 2024 data. Beni Irurita of UAGN stated that the sector is experiencing 'concern', particularly among farm operators, who are holding ongoing meetings with the Department of Animal Health. The concern stems from the fact that, despite strict biosecurity measures, the risk remains outside their control due to migratory birds arriving in winter. Irurita emphasized that the disease is classified as type A, which implies eradication is the goal\u2014making vaccination incompatible with current policy. The Government of Arag\u00f3n has responded by confining outdoor poultry farms, a measure likened to COVID-19 lockdowns. Irurita stressed that avian influenza only affects birds, though susceptibility varies by species (e.g., ducks vs. chickens), and urged the public not to panic: 'Consumers should remain calm regarding poultry meat, eggs, and other farm products.' Veterinarian Nicol\u00e1s Urbani explained that the virus has low and high pathogenicity strains, with the latter\u2014currently detected in Navarra and Aragon\u2014especially affecting migratory birds during their seasonal journey. Stressed, exhausted birds are more likely to reactivate latent infections. While the disease primarily affects birds, rare cases of transmission to mammals\u2014particularly carnivores consuming infected carcasses\u2014have been noted. In case of a farm outbreak, the protocol requires official reporting, laboratory confirmation, mandatory culling, movement restrictions, and a 10-kilometer surveillance zone (potentially expanding to 20 km). Urbani also highlighted the critical role of hunters as 'sanitary sentinels' in detecting sick or dead birds, recommending avoidance of waterfowl hunting in wetlands and compliance with the national directive prohibiting the use of calls for waterfowl hunting. The case has triggered heightened vigilance across the region.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[COPE | Noticias y radio online](https://www.cope.es/emisoras/navarra/podcast/noticias/sector-avicola-navarro-alerta-primer-caso-gripe-aviar-vivimos-horas-preocupacion-20251029_3241463.html)\n\n**H9N2 Bird Flu Virus Could Pose Human Pandemic Risk, Experts Warn**\nThe H9N2 avian influenza virus, previously considered low-risk due to its mild effects in birds, may pose a pandemic threat to humans, according to researchers led by Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong. Although H9N2 has caused 173 human infections since 1998\u2014mostly in China\u2014surveillance has focused more on the more deadly H5N1 strain, which has killed 21 people since 2020 and spread to dairy cows in North America. H9N2 is the second most common bird flu strain in humans, yet infections are likely underreported because they often cause mild or asymptomatic illness, and people are more commonly tested for H5N1. To\u2019s team found that H9N2 has undergone genetic changes since 2015, making it more infectious to human cells: a 2024 virus sample infected more human cells in lab tests than a 1999 sample and showed improved binding to human cell receptors. However, no evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission has been found. Michelle Wille from the Peter Doherty Institute notes that for H9N2 to trigger a pandemic, it must adapt to prefer human cell receptors and grow efficiently at human body temperature and pH levels. Wille stresses the need for enhanced surveillance, particularly in mammals near birds or poultry, to detect viral reassortment\u2014where genetic material from multiple viruses mixes in a host, potentially creating novel pandemic-capable strains. To warns that H9N2 genetic material has already been detected in past human bird flu outbreaks, underscoring the urgency of monitoring low-pathogenicity strains, which are not currently required to be reported by countries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 12:21 PM\nSource:[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/h9n2-bird-flu-virus-could-pose-human-pandemic-risk-experts-warn/)\n\n**Video: Avian Influenza: Answers to the Most Important Questions About the New Disease**\nThe avian influenza (bird flu) has emerged as a new public health concern following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primarily affecting birds, the disease has now spread to other animals including cats and cows, and in rare cases, humans. The Robert Koch Institute confirms over 2,600 human cases worldwide since 2003, with the H5N1 variant causing particular concern; however, no human-to-human transmission has been documented. H5N1 cases are currently reported in Asia and the Americas, with outbreaks among dairy cows in the United States since March 2024. The virus has not yet been detected in Europe, but there is a potential risk of introduction via trade in cattle or beef products. Transmission occurs mainly through raw milk, not airborne routes. The risk to people working with animals is considered low to moderate. Symptoms include fever, cough, breathing difficulties, and in severe cases, pneumonia; gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting may also occur. Finland plans a vaccination campaign for high-risk groups, while Germany is not participating in the EU\u2019s vaccine procurement. Prevention includes consuming only pasteurized milk and thoroughly cooking meat. Treatment involves antiviral medications such as baloxavir, oseltamivir, or zanamivir, as antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections, according to the Science Media Center.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[RP Online](https://rp-online.de/leben/gesundheit/vogelgrippe-antworten-auf-die-wichtigsten-fragen-zur-neuen-krankheit_vid-117390457)\n\n**Austria Prepares for Avian Influenza Outbreak with New Safety Measures**\nIn response to the advancing avian influenza (bird flu) in Germany, Austria is preparing for a potential outbreak, with experts in Salzburg expecting the federal government to implement safety measures this week. In northeastern Germany, thousands of laying hens, ducks, and turkeys were culled preemptively. Austria is set to activate Level One of its outbreak response protocol, which includes avoiding contact with wild birds, feeding livestock only in enclosed barns or shelters, and securing outdoor water sources. Salzburg\u2019s Regional Veterinary Director Peter Schiefer emphasized strict hygiene practices for farmers, such as disinfecting equipment, using shoe changes, and preventing the introduction of the virus from the environment into farms. The situation in Germany, where over 1,000 dead crane carcasses infected with the H5N1 virus were found recently, is being closely monitored to avoid similar scenarios. According to Schiefer, avian influenza is now a year-round disease, appearing in waves. The Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) states the risk of human transmission remains low, with all known human cases linked to close contact with infected poultry or their feces. Human-to-human transmission has not been observed globally. The current H5N1 subtype circulating in Europe is poorly adapted to humans, and no human infections have been reported in Europe to date.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 05:51 AM\nSource:[salzburg.ORF.at](https://salzburg.orf.at/stories/3327764/)\n\n**How Dangerous Are H5N1 Bird Flu Mutations for Humans?**\nThe H5N1 avian influenza virus, a highly contagious subtype of the Influenza A virus, is currently widespread in Germany and globally, primarily affecting birds such as cranes, but also found in various mammals including cats, bears, and seals. While human infections remain rare, with 992 confirmed cases worldwide according to the ECDC\u2014mostly in Asia, Turkey, Spain, the UK, and the US\u2014symptoms in humans range from mild eye or respiratory infections to severe pneumonia that can be fatal. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently assesses the risk to the general population as low, noting that the virus has not yet efficiently adapted to human cells. However, researchers warn that a single mutation\u2014such as the Q226L mutation\u2014could significantly enhance the virus's ability to bind to human receptors, potentially enabling human-to-human transmission. The risk of a pandemic remains low for now, but experts caution that if H5N1 were to co-infect a human with seasonal influenza, genetic reassortment could create a novel, transmissible strain, similar to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The virus has also recently infected cattle in the US, raising concerns about zoonotic transmission and the potential for contaminated raw milk to spread the virus to other livestock. While the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) considers the risk of transmission via imported dairy products as very low due to processing and lack of live cattle imports from the US, isolated cases in mammals\u2014such as an infected sheep in England\u2014have been reported, likely due to contact with contaminated equipment on farms with infected poultry. Authorities recommend avoiding direct contact with sick or dead wild birds and maintaining strict biosecurity measures in poultry and livestock farming.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 02:38 PM\nSource:[schwarzwaelder-bote.de](https://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/inhalt.vogelgrippe-pandemie-wie-gefaehrlich-ist-der-subtyp-h5n1-fuer-menschen.15a49190-ce80-4b1b-a578-aa061e0bac49.html)\n\n**H5N1 Avian Flu Ravages the U.S. as Federal Government Shutdown Undermines Public Health Response**\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread across the United States, affecting over 1,761 commercial and backyard poultry farms in nearly 50 states by early 2024, with a significant shift in 2024 when it began infecting dairy cattle across 18 states and 976 farms by July 2025. This marked the first widespread mammalian transmission, leading to 70 confirmed human cases by May 2025\u2014up from just one in 2022\u2014with 41 linked to contact with infected cows and 24 to poultry farms. Despite the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stating the public health risk remains 'low' and no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, global health experts are alarmed by viral adaptations observed in Kansas cattle and rising case numbers. The outbreak has triggered economic devastation: over 168 million poultry have been culled since December 2024, reducing egg supply by 7%\u201310% and driving the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs to $5.89 in February 2025\u2014peaking above $8\u2014up from $4.10 in late 2024. The USDA paid over $1.4 billion in compensation between January 2022 and November 2024. The crisis intensified in September 2025, with nearly 7 million farm birds dead, including 1.3 million turkeys, threatening Thanksgiving supplies. Wild bird infections surged, and outbreaks were confirmed in Idaho, Nebraska, and Texas. The pandemic coincided with a federal government shutdown due to partisan budget disputes, which severely disrupted the public health response. The CDC\u2019s official avian flu website displayed a notice stating it was 'under revision in accordance with a presidential executive order,' and the agency ceased publishing its vital biweekly H5N1 situation summaries starting January 17, 2025. Although emergency plans claimed essential services would continue, in practice, data collection, analysis, and oversight were halted. The CDC acknowledged delays in monitoring report analysis and inability to guide state and local health departments. Systemic damage included the dismissal of public health inspectors, freezing of NIH research funding reviews, and massive cuts to USAID personnel, leading to the abrupt termination of U.S. surveillance programs in 49 countries. The shutdown, a political choice rather than a natural disaster, turned the public health system into a casualty of partisan conflict, severely undermining the CDC\u2019s credibility as the nation\u2019s source of truth. This erosion of trust\u2014critical during any pandemic\u2014inflicted lasting damage on America\u2019s most vital intangible asset: public confidence in science and government.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:07 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://technews.tw/2025/10/28/with-h5n1-bird-flu-ravaging-the-u-s-the-federal-government-cuts-research-budgets-and-shuts-down/)\n\n**Avian Influenza in Europe and the World: June\u2013September 2025 Monitoring Report**\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a scientific report on highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Europe and globally, covering the period from June 7 to September 5, 2025. The report, produced in collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the EU Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza, provides a comprehensive overview of HPAI A(H5) detections in poultry, captive birds, and wild birds across 15 European countries. A total of 183 detections were reported, with the majority (156) occurring in wild birds\u2014particularly in colonial seabirds, especially the European herring gull. There was a noted decline in detections among waterfowl compared to previous months. In poultry, the number of affected farms was lower than in the prior monitoring period (March\u2013June 2025), and no secondary spread of outbreaks was observed. In mammals, four Arctic foxes in Norway tested positive for HPAI A(H5N5). In the United States, HPAI A(H5N1) detections in dairy cattle remained stable, while the muskrat and the round-tailed ground squirrel were reported as newly infected species. Regarding human health, 19 human cases were reported between June 7 and September 5, 2025, including three fatalities, in Bangladesh (1 case of A(H5N1)), Cambodia (11 cases of A(H5N1)), China (1 case of A(H10N3) and 5 cases of A(H9N2)), and India (1 case of A(H5N1)). In most A(H5N1) human cases, exposure to poultry preceded illness. No human-to-human transmission was documented during this period. The risk of infection remains low for the general population in the EU/EEA and low to moderate for individuals with occupational or other exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments. The report concludes that HPAI continues to circulate persistently in wild birds across Europe, with emerging mammalian infections, necessitating sustained surveillance and preventive measures. EFSA recommends long-term risk reduction strategies in poultry farming, such as avoiding high-risk areas for farms, reducing flock density in vulnerable zones, and maintaining high biosecurity standards.

Genetic sequencing of the virus is underway, with results expected in 1\u20132 days. The CDC maintains that the public risk remains low, emphasizing that all infections are directly linked to exposure to infected poultry, with no unexpected increases in flu activity reported in Colorado or other states experiencing outbreaks in cows and poultry. A CDC spokesperson stated, 'These cases underscore the importance of taking precautions when working with potentially infected animals.' As of July 22, 2024, Colorado had confirmed a total of nine human cases linked to poultry outbreaks. Additional updates include two confirmed human cases in California (October 3, 2024) tied to dairy cow exposure and a first U.S. case without known animal exposure in Missouri (September 6, 2024), reported on August 10, 2025.

HPAI is a highly contagious transboundary disease with zoonotic potential, causing variable clinical signs and high mortality rates in both wild and domestic bird populations. Current outbreaks have severely impacted countries globally, causing losses of rare and important wild bird species, as well as significant social and economic costs, including livelihood losses and egg shortages. The spread of HPAI also strains poultry\u2011related businesses, as measures such as culling and movement restrictions are necessary to contain the virus, which can disrupt the trade of poultry products. The ongoing devastation highlights the urgent need for improved control measures to prevent spillover and viral changes that could lead to a global pandemic. HPAI also infects mammals and humans, posing serious public health risks; infected mammals include domestic cats, cattle, and wild animals such as foxes and seals, with human cases, although rare, occurring in those with close contact with infected poultry or environments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 03:57 AM\nSource:[Social News XYZ](https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/09/15/us-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-flu-in-nebraska-dairy-herd/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014public health surveillance, veterinary medicine, epidemiology, virology, and global health\u2014the consensus is that while the biological plausibility and frequency of mild/asymptomatic H5N1 infections have grown, and the risk environment is heightened due to increasing mammalian adaptation and more human cases, the base rate and recent history strongly favor a 'No' outcome for this question. Specifically, experts stress that:\n\n- The core resolution criterion is an official CDC report, before January 1, 2026, stating that a specific case of H5N1 was likely or more likely than not due to human-to-human transmission. General scientific plausibility or retrospective review (e.g., historical clusters) is not sufficient.\n- Surveillance and reporting gaps remain, with current systems focused mainly on symptomatic/animal-exposed cases, and recent operational disruptions at the CDC (government shutdown, etc.) further impairing the likelihood of timely detection and reporting of limited transmission.\n- Several recent CDC and academic reviews acknowledge probable or likely human-to-human transmission events in the past, and urge more robust investigation of clusters, but as of late October 2025, no such official CDC report has been issued for new cases since July 2024.\n- The historical base rate for such official reports is extremely low, and agencies like the CDC and WHO remain institutionally conservative, requiring strong evidence before confirming human-to-human spread.\n- The rise in mammalian adaptation (e.g., cattle, cats), increased U.S. and global human cases (including some with unclear exposure), and emphasis on improved cluster investigation do modestly increase the probability of a late-breaking report, especially if a clear, well-documented cluster without animal exposure emerges.\n- Quantitative forecasts range from 7% to 35%, with most clustered in the 20\u201335% range. All agree the probability is meaningfully higher than in early 2024, but still firmly below 50% due to the stringent CDC reporting threshold, lack of current official cases, and operational/political hurdles.\n\nOverall, the expert community expects that despite growing scientific openness to the possibility of limited human-to-human H5N1 transmission, the CDC is unlikely to officially declare such a case before the year\u2019s end. The consensus probability is low but not negligible, consistently anchored by a strong status quo bias and the high evidentiary bar for question resolution.",
