With only 10 days left in the resolution window, the base rate for surprise exits of this type among such a large set (~100 officials) is modest\u2014more likely over months, not days, absent clear reporting. That said, Trump's historic willingness to replace Cabinet or prominent officials abruptly means a risk remains meaningfully above zero. Given the sensitivity of the Executive Branch to last-minute changes, the administration's appetite for headline-making firings, and the possibility of breaking news, a low but non-negligible probability is warranted\u2014substantially higher than under, say, a Biden administration with a similar time window.

There is credible evidence\u2014across three major news outlets (Daily Mail, The Mint, Daily Beast)\u2014that US Attorney Erik Siebert is facing imminent removal specifically because of his refusal to charge NY AG Letitia James. This would constitute a clear 'Yes' if announced or effected in the next 10 days. While status quo stickiness and judicial obstacles have recently reversed certain mass firings, these appear mostly limited to career civil servants/probationary workers, not the kind of high-level, more politically-exposed officials on this list. Base rates for dismissals of Cabinet, sub-Cabinet, and US Attorneys during Trump\u2019s prior terms late in the year rarely exceed 1\u20132 per two-week period unless there\u2019s a major crisis or scandal; but the confluence of direct reports of planned firings, Trump\u2019s historical volatility, and the size of the list lifts the base expectation. Importantly, timing and certainty of effecting or announcing a departure is always tricky\u2014media reports about Siebert\u2019s firing are numerous, but unless the announcement comes before October 1, it does not count. Given all of this, the risk this resolves 'Yes' is significant, but below 50/50 due to the very short window and the possibility of delays/rescission.",

News articles show that efforts to purge high-level policy and administrative officials are ongoing\u2014BLS director was fired weeks ago, DOJ officials are at live risk of imminent ouster, and ongoing disputes at the Fed indicate live threats. Although recent legal reversals have protected some civil-service workers, these do not provide full insulation for strictly political or high-level appointees (the bulk of the list). While there is no distinct, evidence-based report of a *specific* listed official already scheduled for removal in the remaining period, both the base rate of similar removals and current elite theory dynamics (loyalty purges, blame shifting at end of fiscal year, ongoing DOJ difficulties, strong executive dominance) make it likelier than not that at least one name here will be gone or have a departure announced before October 1.

The only meaningful offsetting factors are legal obstacles that in some high-profile cases (e.g., Lisa Cook) have delayed exits past announcement or presidential order, and court reversals of mass firings. However, since the question resolves on announced intention to remove (not on litigation completion or final agency determination), and since testimony and sources indicate the Siebert firing is not being challenged in the same way, a No outcome is plausible only if the administration pauses, reverses, or withholds public announcement on Siebert or similar officials until after October 1, 2025\u2014an unlikely sequence.

Critiques of extreme probabilities highlight a key point: most reported or imminent firings do not satisfy the specific official-list criteria. Legal delays, administrative inertia, and recent mass firing reversals all remain strong barriers to rapid, qualifying turnover. There is no public reporting of any listed individual being removed, resigning, or announcing departure for the window in question. The base rate for turnover among such senior posts, even in a highly volatile environment, is very low over 10 days with a sample of ~100 roles. Therefore, given confirmation through group inputs that most risk is focused on non-listed roles, and in absence of new, list-specific evidence, I see no reason to increase the probability. If anything, the group review affirms this outlook, so my probability remains unchanged.",

This sharply reduces the practical likelihood that the reported firing/announcement activity will actually result in a 'Yes' resolution, as all direct news evidence about imminent action centers on Siebert. Additionally, discussion pointed out status quo bias remains meaningful even in periods of turmoil and that recent legal/judicial reversals (such as in the Lisa Cook case and mass probationary firings) further slow or nullify high-level dismissals. While the Trump administration's volatility and the large official list still moderately elevate 'Yes' risk, the lack of hard evidence of any listed official's impending removal within the next 10 days means my initial probability was somewhat overstated. Aligning with stronger weight on the actual list and base rates, I am revising down.",

(2) Recent legal setbacks and judicial interventions have slowed or stayed several high-profile removals, as in the Lisa Cook case, underscoring the friction that can halt or delay even a strongly signaled departure. Though the Trump administration's base rate of last-minute elite turnover remains much higher than normal, with an ongoing climate of purges, there is currently no direct and credible reporting of a listed official being removed, resigning, or an agency announcing such in the remaining 10-day window. The large list size and executive volatility still push probability significantly above a low base rate, but over 2:1 odds now seems too high given the status quo stickiness and lack of direct evidence for the question\u2019s actual list. Legal friction and inertia must be weighted more. I am therefore revising downward, while still placing the odds above the median forecast for Trump's White House.",

This substantially undermines the case for an extreme probability. The critiques correctly note that while administration volatility and late-September churn elevate hazard, the actual role-specific evidence for a qualifying 'Yes' is thinner than my initial forecast assumed. Judicial reversals and bureaucratic friction, as well as the lack of credible reporting of any other listed official's imminent ouster, mean that we are back to a scenario where the base rate is modestly elevated but not exceptionally high. Although the overall climate remains unusually hazardous, the absence of a clear near-term target among the 100 listed officials warrants bringing the probability sharply down. I still believe the chance is meaningfully higher than under a typical administration in a similar time frame, but not at near-certainty levels.",

            "reasoning_for_revised_probability": "Upon review of group deliberation, my original forecast remains broadly well-calibrated. Multiple forecasters projected much higher probabilities, largely driven by media reports about the imminent firing of Erik Siebert, but those with more procedural expertise, like US Federal Government Affairs, correctly note that Siebert is not on the question's list. Critiques reinforced my emphasis on strict adherence to the Fine Print. Some forecasters argue that turnover hazard is temporally 'lumpy', and that late-September has historically been a period of increased churn, especially in turbulent administrations like Trump\u2019s\u2014suggesting a modest bump in risk. However, no additional direct evidence or persuasive scenario applicable to a listed official surfaced in the debate. Judicial and bureaucratic resistance to formal removals remains salient, and monitoring the difference between rumors/leaks versus official, qualifying announcements is crucial. Thus, while the churn environment could argue for a VERY slight upward tweak, the core calculus did not change. I remain in the lower, status-quo-skewing band, but will nudge the probability up to 27 to reflect the slightly elevated churn risk highlighted by group deliberation.",

Critiques from the Executive Branch Succession Procedures and Bureaucratic Politics forecasters persuasively point out that Erik Siebert, while prominently featured in imminent firing news, does NOT actually appear on the Fine Print list of roles for this question\u2014which is a crucial technical limitation. This undermines the argument that Siebert\u2019s firing would almost certainly trigger a 'Yes' resolution. Their careful reading of the precise resolution criteria, and caution regarding the absence of explicit, list-matching imminent departures, warrants some reduction. However, the Elite Theory and my own Principal-Agent argument retain strength: the administration's behavior, volatility, and the unusually large/at-risk population still drive risk meaningfully above generic base rates, especially with the resolution triggered by an announced departure. The resulting adjustment is to reflect this lowered, but still elevated, risk: the revised forecast balances the absence of Siebert/a list-matching imminent firing with residual hazard from unannounced or possible late-in-window resignations/firings across 100 roles.",

            "reasoning_for_revised_probability": "Having reviewed both my initial argument and the other forecasters\u2019 group deliberation, my core reading of the situation is reinforced: the Siebert firing, widely cited as the main evidence for imminent turnover risk, is not actionable for this question since he is not on the Fine Print list. Several more aggressive forecasts (35%, 69%, 87%, 95%) assign excess probability on the basis of a risk climate or relate high administrative volatility too directly to this short window, while careful analysis by several forecasters (including myself, US Federal Government Affairs, and Bureaucratic Politics Model) points to the lack of concrete evidence tying imminent departures to the specific list. Judicial interventions and the unique friction seen in recent highly public firings (BLS director, Lisa Cook at the Fed) make short-fuse action even less likely. No new scandals or agency confrontations have emerged to heighten the risk for the listed 100 roles. Nonetheless, the group\u2019s discussions remind me that the present White House is unusually capable of generating last-minute drama, so a truly extreme tail risk (say, below 5%) is not justified. Accordingly, I affirm my prior reasoning but make a slight upward revision to 12% to reflect ongoing administrative turbulence and the possibility\u2014albeit unlikely\u2014of a bolt-from-the-blue 'Yes' scenario in the final 10 days.",

The judge\u2019s permanent decision, while not ordering reinstatement, required OPM and the affected agencies to remove any derogatory references to the dismissals and to send formal letters to each worker stating the firings were revoked. The ruling followed a preliminary injunction that had been halted by the Supreme Court. AFGE President Everett Kelley said the decision was 'another significant victory for federal employees and for all Americans,' and praised the judge for exposing the \u2018sham record\u2019 used to justify the firings. AFSCME President Lee Saunders echoed the sentiment, noting the relief for members and the broader impact on public services. The firings, carried out between Feb.\u202f12\u201117 via a standardized OPM form letter, targeted 25,000 workers across agencies including Veterans Affairs, Energy, Defense, Agriculture, Interior, Treasury, the FAA, and others. Judge Alsup noted that OPM had directed agencies to terminate employees except those in 'mission\u2011critical' roles or exempted under OPM approval, a directive he deemed unlawful. The case also highlighted exemptions: the Justice Department sought relief for 10,485 workers, and the National Transportation Safety Board argued that cutting even 30 probationary workers would jeopardize investigations such as the Baltimore Harbor bridge collapse and the fatal Army helicopter crash near Washington National Airport, which involved 13 probationary investigators. The unions described the firings as 'one of the most massive employment frauds in U.S. history.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:13 PM\nSource:[People's World](https://peoplesworld.org/?post_type=article&p=152483)\n\n**Trump Deputies Shrink Asylum Loophole by 65 Percent**\nThe article reports that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has reduced President Joe Biden\u2019s asylum loophole by 65\u202fpercent, citing a 1.1\u202fmillion\u2011case backlog that is being processed more quickly.  According to the piece, Trump\u2011appointed judges in July\u202f2025 approved only 20\u202fpercent of asylum pleas\u2014down from 57\u202fpercent in October\u202f2023\u2014while rejecting 75\u202fpercent of claims, up from 45\u202fpercent in October\u202f2023.  In July\u202f2025, the judges heard 9,830 cases, compared with 6,237 in October\u202f2023, and granted asylum to 1,939 migrants versus 3,185 approved by Biden\u2019s judges.

First, whistleblower documents released to the Senate Judiciary Committee show that a Biden\u2011era FBI probe\u2014codenamed \u2018Arctic\u202fFrost\u2019\u2014targeted 92 Republican\u2011linked entities, including Turning Point USA, over a \u2018multifaceted conspiracy\u2019 to keep Donald\u202fTrump in power after the 2020 election. The investigation, begun in April\u202f2022 under Director Christopher\u202fWray, involved more than 150 interviews, over 400 subpoenas (300 for witness records, 200 phone selectors, 20 financial probes), and search warrants for 10 phones, 20 devices, seven iCloud accounts, 28 emails and even Trump\u2019s Twitter. Second, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome\u202fPowell announced a 0.25\u2011percentage\u2011point cut to the benchmark interest rate, the first reduction since December\u202f2024, citing a slight rise in unemployment and persistent inflation. Powell said, 'While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals and in light of this shift in the balance of risks, today the Federal market committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point.' The move lifted the Dow and S&P\u202f500 to record highs and is expected to be followed by similar cuts in October and December. Third, Secretary of State Marco\u202fRubio concluded a Middle East trip as Israel launched a ground invasion of Gaza City. Heritage Foundation VP Victoria\u202fCoates warned that the assault could complicate negotiations, noting that Hamas \u2018won\u2019t let them out\u2019 and that neighboring countries are blocking exits. The briefing also noted an Israeli airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, which the Qatari government condemned. The article cites Republican Senator Chuck\u202fGrassley, Democrat Senator Chuck\u202fGrassley, Powell, and Coates, but presents the events largely from a conservative perspective.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 06:45 AM\nSource:[The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/morning-brief-biden-targeted-tpusa-fed-finally-lowers-rates-israel-pushes-into-gaza-city)\n\n**Judge rules that probationary federal workers were fired illegally \u2014 AGU\u2019s plaintiff coalition prevails**\nOn September 15, 2025, a federal judge ruled that the Trump Administration illegally fired tens of thousands of probationary federal employees in February. The decision made permanent a preliminary injunction issued in April 2025. The court ordered the Office of Personnel Management to update personnel records to remove false claims that the firings were performance\u2011based and to refrain from similar actions in the future. The ruling covers agencies such as Agriculture, Commerce (including NOAA), Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior (USGS), Treasury, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, EPA, GSA, NSF, and SBA. Janice R. Lachance, Executive Director and CEO of the American Federation of Government Employees, praised the decision, saying 'We applaud the judge\u2019s decision and echo his striking rebuke against the clear illegality of OPM\u2019s actions,' and added 'This outcome shows that the destruction of the scientific workforce that is so vital to our health, safety, and national security is not inevitable.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 05:49 PM\nSource:[yubanet.com](https://yubanet.com/usa/judge-rules-that-probationary-federal-workers-were-fired-illegally-agus-plaintiff-coalition-prevails/)\n\n**Trump Officials Set to Remove US Attorney Over James Probe | Mint**\nAccording to the Mint article, Trump administration officials informed US Attorney Erik Siebert that he would be removed from his position because he did not prosecute New\u202fYork Attorney General Letitia James on alleged mortgage\u2011fraud charges. Siebert, who was nominated by President Trump in May and had served as interim US attorney since January, was asked to bring charges after the Justice Department\u2019s probe into James was triggered by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte\u2019s claims that she misrepresented her residence status on mortgage applications. The article notes that Siebert\u2019s office found insufficient evidence to charge James, and that he may continue working as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia after his removal. The piece also recounts that James won a $454\u202fmillion civil\u2011fraud case against Trump in 2024, a penalty that was struck down by a New\u202fYork appeals court in August but that upheld the finding that Trump inflated the value of his assets. Trump\u2019s administration, led by Justice Department official Ed Martin, targeted several Democrats\u2014including James, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and Senator Adam Schiff\u2014over mortgage\u2011fraud allegations; Cook was fired in August, sued Trump, and a federal judge allowed her to remain in office pending a Supreme Court ruling. Schiff, a long\u2011time critic of Trump, was pardoned by President Biden. The article presents these facts without overt editorializing, citing the actions of Trump officials and the DOJ\u2019s investigations as the primary sources of information.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 10:08 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/politics/trump-officials-set-to-remove-us-attorney-over-james-probe-11758319455156.html)\n\n**Report: Trump to oust US attorney who wouldn't charge Letitia James**\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to fire U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert because Siebert failed to find evidence that New York Attorney General Letitia James committed mortgage fraud. ABC News reported that Trump officials pressured Siebert to bring charges against James, but he did not. Trump has a history of animosity toward James, dating back to her successful lawsuit against the Trump Organization, which resulted in a $354\u202fmillion fine that was later overturned by a New York appeals court. The mortgage fraud investigation into James began in April after Bill Pulte, director of the Federal House Finance Agency, sent a criminal referral to the DOJ. Trump officials have accused James of falsely claiming her Virginia property was her primary residence on a 2023 financial document, a claim that would violate her legal requirement to live in New York as an elected official. Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'Letitia James, a totally corrupt politician, should resign from her position as New York State Attorney General, IMMEDIATELY,' and added, 'Everyone is trying to MAKE NEW YORK GREAT AGAIN, and it can never be done with this wacky crook in office.' Siebert was nominated by Trump in May, but the administration now plans to replace him with a U.S. attorney who will more aggressively investigate James. Democratic and liberal critics say the DOJ is being used to target Trump\u2019s political foes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-15114879/Report-Trump-set-oust-US-attorney-wouldnt-charge-Letitia-James.html)\n\n**Trump Plots to Fire Prosecutor for Failing to Charge His Nemesis**\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly planning to fire U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert of the Eastern District of Virginia after Siebert declined to bring criminal charges against New\u202fYork Attorney General Letitia James, whom Trump has accused of mortgage fraud.  According to ABC\u202fNews, the Trump administration asked the Department of Justice in April to investigate James for alleged mortgage fraud, but investigators found that James only listed the home as a primary residence on a limited power\u2011of\u2011attorney form that allowed her niece to sign documents on her behalf; loan officers who approved the mortgage did not consider the document, sources told ABC.  Despite this, the administration demanded charges, and after Siebert refused, officials warned him that Trump plans to fire him, potentially destabilizing the office.  Siebert, who has served as interim U.S. attorney since January and was nominated by Trump in May, is expected to leave by Friday.  The administration intends to replace him with someone who will pursue James more aggressively.  Trump has publicly called James a \"totally corrupt politician\" and urged her resignation on Truth Social, saying \"Letitia James, a totally corrupt politician, should resign from her position as New\u202fYork State Attorney General, IMMEDIATELY,\" and that \"Everyone is trying to MAKE NEW\u202fYORK GREAT AGAIN, and it can never be done with this wacky crook in office.\"  The DOJ is also investigating James for \"deprivation of rights,\" and Trump had stripped her of her security clearance in February.  The article notes that similar mortgage\u2011fraud claims have been directed at Sen. Adam Schiff and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, despite evidence to the contrary.  It also references the court case where the Trump Organization was found to have committed fraud by over\u2011inflating property values, resulting in a judgment for $364\u202fmillion plus interest, now about $527\u202fmillion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-plots-to-fire-prosecutor-for-failing-to-charge-his-nemesis-letitia-james/)\n\n**Government Workers, AFSCME cheer judge's ruling against Trump's firings**\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco ruled that the Trump administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) illegally terminated 25,000 probationary federal workers in February 2025.

Patel, a former aide to Donald Trump, was confirmed on 20\u202fFebruary\u202f2025 with 51 votes in favor and 49 against, a much narrower margin than the 90\u2011plus votes that secured his predecessors.  He has repeatedly defended his actions in high\u2011profile cases, including the investigation of Charlie\u202fKirk\u2019s alleged murder, where he announced a suspect on social media and released photos and videos despite agency recommendations.  Critics point to the mass exodus of FBI personnel\u2014about 5,000 employees fired or retired since Patel took command\u2014as evidence of a \u201cdeep state\u201d purge.  The former director of the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, Brian\u202fDriscoll, has sued the agency, claiming Patel knew the firings were possibly illegal.  Patel has also defended the handling of the Jeffrey\u202fEpstein files, asserting there is no credible evidence of a \u201cclient list\u201d and that the DOJ\u2019s July memo was accurate.  Trump has publicly praised Patel, calling him a \u201cbrilliant lawyer\u201d and a defender of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d  The article quotes Patel saying, \u2018No pienso irme a ning\u00fan lado,\u2019 and Maria\u202fPuerta Riera, a professor at Valencia College, stating, \u2018La principal credencial de Patel no es la idoneidad para el cargo, sino su lealtad al presidente.\u2019  The piece also notes that 5,000 staff have been dismissed, and that the agency\u2019s chief, Andrew\u202fBailey, was appointed as a deputy director on 15\u202fSeptember\u202f2025.

The investigation, begun in April\u202f2022 under Director Christopher\u202fWray, involved more than 150 interviews, over 400 subpoenas (300 for witness records, 200 phone selectors, 20 financial probes), and search warrants for 10 phones, 20 devices, seven iCloud accounts, 28 emails and even Trump\u2019s Twitter. Second, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome\u202fPowell announced a 0.25\u2011percentage\u2011point cut to the benchmark interest rate, the first reduction since December\u202f2024, citing a slight rise in unemployment and persistent inflation. Powell said, 'While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals and in light of this shift in the balance of risks, today the Federal market committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point.' The move lifted the Dow and S&P\u202f500 to record highs and is expected to be followed by similar cuts in October and December. Third, Secretary of State Marco\u202fRubio concluded a Middle East trip as Israel launched a ground invasion of Gaza City. Heritage Foundation VP Victoria\u202fCoates warned that the assault could complicate negotiations, noting that Hamas \u2018won\u2019t let them out\u2019 and that neighboring countries are blocking exits. The briefing also noted an Israeli airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, which the Qatari government condemned.

The Washington Post notes that agencies have \u2018extensive flexibility\u2019 in reassigning employees, and workers keep their pay grade, yet many now perform lower\u2011level work while earning high salaries.

At HUD, civil\u2011rights attorneys who had investigated housing discrimination were reassigned to defend the agency against complaints; one employee said, \u2018I\u2019ve never had a customer\u2011service job,\u2019 and added, \u2018And you\u2019re trying to force me to do what I\u2019m worst at.\u2019  Paul Osadebe, a longtime HUD civil\u2011rights attorney, said, \u2018[The reassignments are] another thing, in the long line of efforts, to get us to just quit and abandon ship,\u2019 when asked about the moves.

CNBC notes the revision was on the high end of Wall Street expectations, ranging from 600,000 to 1\u202fmillion, and that the adjustment was more than 50\u202f% higher than last year\u2019s and the largest on record since 2002. The article argues that the Biden administration\u2019s positive job\u2011growth narratives were misleading, implying the Fed should have cut rates earlier. It cites a Wall Street Journal quote that the revision could amplify worries about a weaker job market and notes that the Fed\u2019s next rate\u2011cut decision will be influenced by the new data. The piece frames the revisions as evidence of systemic problems with the BLS, calls for an overhaul, and suggests that Trump\u2019s decision to fire the BLS head was justified.

According to Reuters, many of these employees are women and people of color who have served for decades in Republican and Democratic administrations, often in positions unknown to the public. More than 20 employees who were listed on the 'watchlists' spoke to Reuters, revealing the impact on their lives. Some have increased security measures in their homes or avoided public appearances, while others have removed their personal information from the internet. Over half of them reported feeling anxious, with some describing their lives as 'quietly collapsing', and others experiencing depression and isolation. Reuters relied on legal documents, public records, and interviews with over 30 sources to track the transformation of 'American Accountability Foundation' from a research organization opposing President Joe Biden to a powerful tool in Trump's campaign to purge perceived 'internal enemies'. The organization targets professional employees who implement current government policies, not political appointees, and justifies this by claiming that many of them have liberal leanings and may be working in secret to undermine Trump's agenda, according to the organization's president, Tom Jones, who told Fox News in June 2024: 'These people want to remain invisible within the agencies, and we will expose them.' In response to Reuters, Jones defended his organization's work, stating that their goal is to alert employees who oppose Trump that they are being monitored. He said: 'We stand by our research, and our only regret is that more of these individuals did not leave their positions to be replaced by those who are committed to the American people's agenda.' Reuters reported that at least 88 employees have left their government jobs or been forced to take administrative leave. Some were fired during Trump's mass federal layoffs, while others left in fear of being fired or reassigned, and two have fled the country fearing for their safety.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 07:15 PM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/3519667)\n\n**Trump Fires Director of Bureau of Labor Statistics, Accusing Her of Manipulating Employment Data**\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered the immediate dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating employment data.

Trump stated, 'I have instructed my team to fire this politically appointed person by Biden, IMMEDIATELY.' He added, 'Important statistics like this must be just and precise; they cannot be manipulated for political purposes.' An analysis by CNN suggests that Trump defended McEntarfer's sudden dismissal, arguing that recent employment reports undermined his message of a 'new golden era.' The move has been seen as an attempt to align official data with a favorable economic narrative for his administration. However, this analysis emphasizes that this action, along with attempts to pressure the Federal Reserve, threatens to erode confidence in the country's economic institutions. William Beach, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, stated, 'The BLS is the best statistical agency in the world. Its numbers enjoy trust worldwide.' He added, 'However, I believe the president's attack on the commissioner and the office is undermining that infrastructure and could undermine that trust in the long term.' The latest employment report revealed a more somber picture than expected, with the US economy creating 73,000 jobs in July, according to the Department of Labor.

He ordered his team to 'immediately fire this politically designated person by Biden,' arguing that Americans need accurate employment numbers. Trump claimed that employment numbers have been manipulated to make Republicans look bad. 'McEntarfer says only 73,000 jobs have been created (what a surprise!). Similar things happened in the first part of the year, always with negative numbers,' Trump said. The July employment report showed that 73,000 jobs were created, while the market had projected 106,000 new jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%.

Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth, 'She will be replaced by someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like these must be just and accurate, not manipulated for political purposes.' Trump claimed that McEntarfer 'falsified' employment data before the November presidential election to help the chances of his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, there is no evidence to support Trump's claims. McEntarfer was confirmed as commissioner by the Senate in January 2024, with 86 votes in favor and 8 against. The White House released a statement saying, 'The long history of inaccuracies and incompetence by Erika McEntarfer, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics designated by Biden, has completely eroded the public's trust in the government agency responsible for disseminating key data used by policymakers and businesses to make important decisions.' The statement also claimed that the agency was plagued by technical errors and leaks of confidential information during McEntarfer's tenure. The order to fire McEntarfer comes amid a wave of mass firings of federal officials, sparked by Supreme Court decisions to overturn lower court rulings that had deemed the firings illegal. The departure of career officials has raised concerns about the quality of economic data, which has long been considered a benchmark. In early 2024, Trump's Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, dissolved two expert committees that worked with the government on economic outcome statistics. Lutnick also suggested eliminating the GDP report from the government, considering that 'all governments' have gotten entangled in the data. The July employment data shows that the labor market has begun to feel the impact of the volatile commercial policy of the Republican administration and, above all, the mass layoffs in the federal administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, a month in which 73,000 new jobs were created, far below the 110,000 expected by analysts and also below the numbers recorded since January. The slowdown in the market would give Powell arguments to decide not to lower interest rates, but it could also serve as ammunition for Trump to increase pressure on Powell.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 08:57 PM\nSource:[elpais.com](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-08-01/trump-despide-a-su-responsable-de-estadisticas-laborales-despues-de-que-publicara-una-desaceleracion-del-empleo.html)\n\n**Trump Fires Biden-Appointed Labor Official Over Employment Data**\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered the dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the federal official responsible for labor statistics, after the release of employment data showing a slowdown in job growth.

Trump accused the economist of manipulating employment figures before the 2024 elections to favor a victory for Kamala Harris, but presented no evidence to support this claim. He stated that under his leadership, the US economy is 'thriving'. McEntarfer, an economist and Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) since January 29, 2024, was nominated by Biden in July 2023 and confirmed by the Senate in January 2024. Trump claimed that McEntarfer 'manipulated' employment figures to favor Harris' electoral chances, stating that 'we need accurate employment numbers. I've ordered my team to fire this Biden-appointed official immediately. She will be replaced by someone much more competent and qualified.' Trump also stated that 'important numbers like this must be fair and accurate; they cannot be manipulated for political purposes.' McEntarfer has not commented on the news. The controversy comes after a report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday, which stated that in July, only 73,000 new jobs were created, a figure far below projections. Additionally, revisions to data from the previous two months show that the situation is much worse than thought. Although the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, the report notes that more people left the workforce.

Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'I just found out that the 'Employment Numbers' are being manipulated by a Biden appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of the BLS, who altered the numbers to benefit Kamala [Harris] before the election. This is the same office that increased the number of jobs in March 2024 by about 818,000 and again, just before the presidential election of 2024, in August and September, with 112,000.' Trump added, 'We need accurate employment numbers. I have already determined that she will be fired IMMEDIATELY and replaced by someone much more capable.' The president also criticized the revision of the employment numbers, saying, 'McEntarfer said that 73,000 jobs were added (a surprise!), but the most serious thing is the correction of 258,000 lost jobs in the two previous months. This has been happening constantly, always with negative numbers.

'We are not tracking federal workers placed on administrative leave or those who take voluntary buyouts.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 05:11 PM\nSource:[KESQ.com](https://kesq.com/news/national-politics/cnn-us-politics/2025/07/10/tracking-trumps-overhaul-of-the-federal-workforce-2/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts analyzing the likelihood that a listed US federal official will be out of their position before October 1, 2025, generally agree that while the Trump administration's high turnover culture and recent, credible reports of imminent dismissals notably elevate the probability above historical baselines, the strict resolution criteria, short remaining time window (~10 days), and substantial legal/bureaucratic obstacles strongly moderate the risk.\n\nMost experts note:\n- Trump\u2019s history of abrupt, high-profile firings and continued high-level purges increases risk (especially for perceived disloyalty or disagreement).\n- There is recent news of specific imminent removals (notably US Attorney Erik Siebert), but critical detail: Siebert does not appear to be on the question's official Fine Print list, and other high-profile ousters (e.g., Lisa Cook, BLS Director) either fall outside the window or are legally blocked.\n- Court interventions and legal challenges have successfully delayed, blocked, or reversed some recent firings, providing a buffer against rapid removals.\n- Base rates for forced departure of senior officials in a two-week period\u2014even in high-turnover Trump environments\u2014are low, given institutional inertia and the absence of clear news about listed individuals\u2019 imminent departures.\n- The question resolves on public announcement or confirmed exit, not just rumors or attempted firings, raising the threshold for a 'Yes.'\n\nForecast probabilities range widely: some experts put the chances of a qualifying departure in the 10\u201324% range based on base rates and legal inertia; others lean toward 33\u201335%, citing Trump\u2019s volatility and the size of the list; and two (using event-centric and principal-agent models) forecast much higher probabilities (69% and 87\u201395%), assessing that the ongoing hostile climate and specific news reports make a surprise departure more likely than not.\n\nConsensus is that, barring a late-breaking, clearly announced and confirmed firing among those strictly listed, 'No' is still the modal outcome, but real and historically high risk remains. The official forecasted probabilities average in the 30\u201335% range, with outliers on both ends reflecting different weights given to recent news versus base rates and legal buffers.",
