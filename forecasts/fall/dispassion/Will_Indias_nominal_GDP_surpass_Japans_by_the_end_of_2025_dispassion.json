However, defenses from FX and Asian macro specialists reinforce the structural momentum favoring India, and the stickiness of these crossovers. My own prior risk assessment\u2014rooted in tiny margin, possible late data/FX shock, and process risk\u2014remains valid, but my original stance may be slightly conservative in underweighting the difficulty of reversal once the consensus and base rate are Yes.

The article notes that this surge will pressure oil\u2011exporting economies, especially Saudi Arabia, which must balance declining oil revenues with digital\u2011economy opportunities. Oil prices fell 9.7% between August\u202f2024 and March\u202f2025, with futures averaging $66.9 per barrel in 2025 and $62.4 in 2026, underscoring Saudi diversification. The IMF also reports that AI has quadrupled the added value of its sectors in the US from 2.4% to 3.5% of GDP between 2010 and 2023, and that AI\u2019s future demand could exceed electric\u2011vehicle demand by 1.5\u00d7. Saudi Arabia has excess power generation capacity, driven by rapid growth in solar, wind and green\u2011hydrogen projects, and billions of dollars invested in data centers and cloud infrastructure. If linked to global clean\u2011energy demand, Saudi could become a regional hub for AI and sustainable energy. However, the IMF projects electricity price rises of 8.6% in the US, 5.3% in China and 3.6% in Europe by 2030, requiring substantial local investment to meet domestic demand while supporting global expansion. The article concludes that Saudi can transform from a traditional oil economy to a knowledge\u2011based digital economy by investing effectively in AI and renewable energy.

It lists India\u2019s rapid growth (7\u20117.8\u202f% GDP growth) and its top\u2011five ranking in services exports and top\u2011ten in foreign direct investment (FDI). Bajran highlights recent improvements: nominal GDP rank rose from 6th in 2019 to 4th in 2024 (\u25b2\u202f2 ranks); services export rank improved from 9th to 5th (\u25b2\u202f4 ranks); logistics performance rank moved from 44th (2018) to 38th (2023) (\u25b2\u202f6 ranks); trade as a % of GDP increased from 30.8\u202f% to 40.8\u202f% (\u25b2\u202f10\u202fpp); and ease\u2011of\u2011doing\u2011business rank jumped from 142nd (2014) to 63rd (2020) (\u25b2\u202f79 ranks).

Fitch recently released estimates showing Italy\u2019s deficit at 3.1% of GDP for 2025\u20112027 and a projected public debt of 137.6% of GDP by 2026, driven in part by the superbonus; this places Italy in a vulnerable position compared with other BBB\u2011rated countries whose average debt is projected at 57.3% in 2024, though Fitch expects a decline in financing risks. The Middle East conflict has intensified, now reaching day 715 of tensions between Israel and Hamas. President Donald Trump described Hamas\u2019s October\u202f7,\u202f2023 attack as a genocide, prompting international reactions. According to the Wall Street Journal, the United States is preparing a $6\u202fbillion arms\u2011sale package for Israel. Israeli forces announced a plan to intensify military use in Gaza City, with Colonel Avichay Adraee urging residents to evacuate to designated humanitarian zones in southern Gaza; Israel has also closed crossings between the West Bank and Jordan. In response, the Global Sumud Flotilla departed from Portopalo, Sicily, carrying aid to Gaza. In Sudan, a paramilitary air attack killed 75 people in a mosque during prayers in a refugee camp in Darfur, amid an ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary groups since April\u202f2023. The war in Ukraine has reached day 1,305. Trump recently labeled a Russian jet incursion into Estonian airspace a serious problem, while Moscow denies violations; NATO reacted by deploying Italian fighters to intercept the Russian aircraft. The European Commission introduced its 19th sanctions package against Russia, targeting payment systems and cryptocurrencies; Ursula von der Leyen declared it time to halt Russian gas supplies, emphasizing a unified EU approach. Russian defense officials denied air\u2011space violations, claiming compliance with international norms, while Estonia sought NATO consultations over the provocations.

The upgrade cites India\u2019s demographic dividend, robust domestic demand and sound government policies. R&I said, 'Despite the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment, India\u2019s economy can be expected to maintain firm growth thanks to the economic structures driven by domestic demand and the policies of the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.' This is India\u2019s third rating upgrade this year, following S&P\u2019s upgrade to BBB from BBB\u2011 in August 2025 and Morningstar DBRS\u2019 upgrade to BBB from BBB (low) in May 2025. S&P Global Ratings noted, 'The upgrade of India reflects its buoyant economic growth, against the backdrop of an enhanced monetary policy environment that anchors inflationary expectations.' R&I acknowledged that a 50\u202f% US tariff increase could pose a risk but argued India\u2019s economy is largely driven by domestic factors and its dependence on US exports is low. The agency also highlighted the GST rate rationalisation, reducing slabs from four to two, and said the tax change would likely be offset by stimulation of private consumption. R&I projects India\u2019s GDP growth to remain in the mid\u20116\u202f% range from FY2026 onwards, supported by population growth, income catch\u2011up effects, public investment and government policies. It noted progress in reducing the fiscal deficit, with a target of 4.4\u202f% of GDP in FY2026, and emphasised the need for accelerated growth to achieve a developed\u2011economy status by 2047.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 12:13 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/ri-japan-upgrades-india-sovereign-credit-rating-bbb-plus-125091900864_1.html)\n\n**Japan's R&I upgrades India's currency rating to BBB+; outlook stable**\nJapan's Rating and Investment Information (R&I) upgraded India's foreign\u2011currency rating to BBB+ on Friday, citing steady growth, improving fiscal discipline and stable external finances, and set the outlook to 'stable'. R&I noted that India\u2019s economy is resilient to global risks such as higher U.S. tariffs because it relies mainly on domestic demand, and praised the policies of the Narendra Modi\u2011led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. The agency said, 'Despite the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment, India's economy can be expected to maintain firm growth thanks to the economic structures driven by domestic demand and the policies of the administration of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.' The government welcomed the upgrade, adding, 'The Government of India remains committed to building on this momentum through policies that promote inclusive, high\u2011quality growth alongside fiscal prudence and macroeconomic stability.' This is the third rating agency to raise India\u2019s ratings in the fiscal year after S&P and Morningstar DBRS. India\u2019s economy grew 6.5\u202f% in FY24 and expanded 7.8\u202f% in the April\u2011June 2025 quarter. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects growth of about 6.5\u202f% this year, supported by strong domestic demand, business investment and government spending. India's fiscal deficit narrowed to 4.8\u202f% of GDP in FY24 and is targeted at 4.4\u202f% in FY25, helped by higher tax revenues and lower subsidies. The current\u2011account deficit remains modest at under 1\u202f% of GDP, while foreign\u2011exchange reserves are strong. The government overhauled the Goods and Services Tax (GST), reducing the 12\u202f% and 28\u202f% slabs, and has asked businesses to pass the benefit to customers to boost consumer demand. RBI has cut the repo rate by 100 basis points since February, before pausing in August, signalling a focus on boosting demand amid low inflation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 11:21 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/japan-s-r-i-upgrades-india-s-currency-rating-to-bbb-outlook-stable-125091900776_1.html)\n\n**Taiwan Surpasses Korea in Key Wealth Indicator, Thanks to TSMC**\nTaiwan is projected to surpass South Korea in per\u2011capita GDP in 2025, ahead of the IMF\u2019s April forecast, largely due to the rise of TSMC and the global AI boom.

The article notes that this surge will pressure oil\u2011exporting economies, especially Saudi Arabia, which must balance declining oil revenues with digital\u2011economy opportunities. Oil prices fell 9.7% between August\u202f2024 and March\u202f2025, with futures averaging $66.9 per barrel in 2025 and $62.4 in 2026, underscoring Saudi diversification. The IMF also reports that AI has quadrupled the added value of its sectors in the US from 2.4% to 3.5% of GDP between 2010 and 2023, and that AI\u2019s future demand could exceed electric\u2011vehicle demand by 1.5\u00d7. Saudi Arabia has excess power generation capacity, driven by rapid growth in solar, wind and green\u2011hydrogen projects, and billions of dollars invested in data centers and cloud infrastructure. If linked to global clean\u2011energy demand, Saudi could become a regional hub for AI and sustainable energy. However, the IMF projects electricity price rises of 8.6% in the US, 5.3% in China and 3.6% in Europe by 2030, requiring substantial local investment to meet domestic demand while supporting global expansion. The article concludes that Saudi can transform from a traditional oil economy to a knowledge\u2011based digital economy by investing effectively in AI and renewable energy.

India is expected to grow at 6.2% in 2025 and 6.3% in 2026, maintaining its position as the fastest-growing large economy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 25, 2025 04:46 AM\nSource:[Republic World](https://www.republicworld.com/business/we-are-a-4-trillion-economy-niti-aayog-ceo-confirms-india-surpasses-japan-to-become-4th-largest)\n\n**India overtakes Japan to become 4th largest economy at $ 4 trillion: NITI Aayog CEO**\nIndia has surpassed Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, according to NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam. 'We are the fourth largest economy as I speak. We are a USD 4 trillion economy as I speak, and this is not my data. This is IMF data. India today is larger than Japan,' said Subrahmanyam. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects India's nominal GDP to reach USD 4,187.017 billion by fiscal 2026, surpassing Japan's estimated GDP of USD 4,186.431 billion. India is expected to remain the fastest-growing major economy over the next two years, with a growth rate of 6.2 per cent in 2025 and 6.3 per cent in 2026. The IMF projects global economic growth to be much lower, at 2.8 per cent in 2025 and 3.0 per cent in 2026. Subrahmanyam stated that India is at a turning point and at a take-off stage where it can grow very rapidly. The Centre and States discussed strategies for various sectors, including manufacturing services, rural, non-farm, urban, informal, and the green economy, during the 10th NITI Aayog Governing Council Meeting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 25, 2025 04:37 AM\nSource:[The Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/policy/economy-india-overtakes-japan-to-become-4th-largest-economy-at-4-trillion-niti-aayog-ceo-3856490/)\n\n**India overtakes Japan to become the world's fourth largest economy: NITI Aayog CEO**\nIndia has surpassed Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, reaching a nominal GDP of USD 4 trillion, according to NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014spanning country risk, macroeconomic modeling, international financial markets, national income accounting, exchange rate theory, development economics, and Asian studies\u2014there is a strong consensus that India will surpass Japan in nominal GDP by the end of 2025, as per the IMF's January 2026 data. All experts note India's robust real GDP growth (6\u20137%), higher inflation (boosting nominal figures), and persistent yen weakness as key structural drivers favoring India. IMF projections and official statements (including NITI Aayog) already indicate India at or just ahead of Japan for 2025, with the projected difference a razor-thin $1\u20133 billion on a ~$4 trillion base. Most also note that once such crossovers occur historically, they tend to persist, barring swift reversals.\n\nHowever, the narrowness of the lead is repeatedly emphasized: experts flag the risk that minor exchange rate shifts (especially a sudden yen recovery), measurement or data revisions, or late-year macro shocks could still tip the balance back to Japan. All assign a non-trivial (10\u201320%) probability to a 'No' outcome for this reason, but consider such events unlikely given current trends and absence of major surprises. Median probabilities assigned fall in the 82\u201390% range, with the majority at 85% or above, reflecting high (but not maximal) confidence in the Yes outcome. Risks center almost entirely on technical factors (FX volatility, final IMF revisions, minuscule margin of difference) not on underlying macro developments, given India's continued strong performance and Japan's stagnation.\n\nIn summary: The expert consensus is that India is highly likely to surpass Japan in nominal GDP by year-end 2025 per IMF data, with the probability weighted at 82\u201392%. This outcome is underpinned by current projections, consistent official statements, India's ongoing growth/divergence from Japan, and sustained yen weakness. The primary risk to this forecast is the possibility of small, last-minute statistical or exchange rate changes reversing the order, but such an outcome is judged unlikely absent a major shock.",
