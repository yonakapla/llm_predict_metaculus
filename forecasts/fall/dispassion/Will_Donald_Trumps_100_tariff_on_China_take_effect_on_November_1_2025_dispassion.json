The presence of a major diplomatic summit on October 31 provides a natural opportunity for de-escalation. The procedural steps required to implement new tariffs, although not insurmountable, provide further levers for delay. The fact that previous extreme tariffs (e.g., 200%) have been threatened but not imposed, and that Trump's own messaging has softened, reinforce the low base rate for follow-through at this severity. While the situation is volatile and a total breakdown is possible, the most likely scenario is that the 100% tariff does not actually take effect on November 1, 2025.

The presence of a diplomatic window (APEC summit, possible Xi-Trump meeting) just days before the deadline is a classic context for last-minute deals, face-saving compromises, or at least implementation delays. The market and economic risks of a 100% tariff are enormous, and domestic pushback is likely. While Trump\u2019s credibility is at stake after repeated threats, he has usually opted for delay or moderation under pressure.

The main risk to this forecast is that the rare earths issue is truly intractable this time, or that mutual miscalculation or loss of face for either leader leads to escalation. However, the overwhelming pattern in US-China trade disputes is that headline threats are walked back, especially when the economic costs are so immediate, public, and destabilizing. The status quo outcome (no 100% tariff) is strongly favored by precedent and incentives on both sides, though a partial, symbolic, or time-limited measure is not out of the question.

This higher estimate may give too much weight to the seriousness of the rare earths dispute and the possibility of a sudden breakdown. From an international trade law perspective, the procedural and legal hurdles to enacting such sweeping tariffs so quickly are formidable, and these mechanisms are often used to delay or soften announced measures. Moreover, the historical record shows that even in high-stakes confrontations, the practical implementation of such tariffs is rare, especially when markets react so negatively. The combination of Trump\u2019s own rhetorical softening, the short window for implementation, and the overwhelming structural incentives for both sides to de-escalate, make anything above a one-in-four chance difficult to justify.

By noting both Trump's rhetorical walk-back and the formidable economic and market pressures, the argument persuasively supports a low probability (15%) for actual implementation.

From a China Studies and US-China relations perspective, it is vital to recognize that both leaders are acutely aware of the catastrophic economic and political consequences of such an extreme escalation, especially given the recent market turmoil. Trump's pattern of using such threats as leverage\u2014often walking them back at the last minute\u2014remains the dominant dynamic, as does Xi's strategy of leaving room for reciprocal de-escalation. The presence of the APEC summit, the well-documented 'TACO' dynamic, and the overwhelming incentives for both sides to save face with a partial or symbolic compromise all favor a much lower probability. While the rare earths issue increases the stakes, the most plausible outcome is still a negotiated delay, partial implementation, or symbolic response.

This announcement triggered a sharp sell-off in U.S. markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 800 points on October 10. Trump also considered canceling his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea. China responded by issuing two new export control regulations targeting rare earth-related materials and technologies, asserting these measures are necessary for national security, similar to U.S. restrictions on chips and semiconductors. China accounts for approximately 70% of global rare earth mining and over 90% of global rare earth processing capacity. Despite the initial hardline stance, Trump reversed course on October 12, posting on Truth Social that 'don\u2019t worry, everything will be fine,' suggesting the tariff threat may be negotiable. U.S. media outlet Axios analyzed that China\u2019s new controls aim to gain leverage in trade negotiations, and if enforced, could severely impact the U.S. economy due to its lack of alternative rare earth sources, threatening sectors like semiconductors and defense.

Additionally, the U.S. will implement export restrictions on all critical software. This announcement triggered a market sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 800 points on October 10. Trump also indicated he might cancel his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. China's Ministry of Commerce had issued two announcements on October 9, 2025, restricting exports of rare earth-related materials and technologies, including those containing Chinese components, citing national security concerns. China produces approximately 70% of the world\u2019s rare earth mining output and controls over 90% of global rare earth processing capacity. China accused the U.S. of hypocrisy, noting that the U.S. also imposes export controls on chips and semiconductors. However, on October 12, Trump posted on Truth Social stating that there was no need to worry about China, and that Xi Jinping would not allow his country to fall into economic depression, prompting a rebound in U.S. stock futures and cryptocurrency prices. According to Axios analysis, China\u2019s new rare earth controls aim to gain leverage in trade negotiations. If fully implemented, they could severely impact the U.S. economy, as the U.S. currently lacks alternative sources for Chinese rare earth minerals, potentially disrupting semiconductor and defense industries.

The move, which also includes U.S. export restrictions on 'any and all critical software,' was framed by Trump as retaliation for what he described as Beijing\u2019s 'extraordinarily aggressive' actions. He claimed China\u2019s control over rare earth elements\u2014essential for smartphones, electric vehicles, military equipment, and renewable energy technology\u2014constitutes a 'hostile' strategy that allows China to 'hold the World captive.' Trump threatened to cancel a planned summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, stating, 'I was to meet President Xi in two weeks... but now there seems to be no reason to do so.' However, he later clarified to reporters in the Oval Office that he had not canceled the meeting, saying, 'I haven\u2019t canceled, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to have it, but I\u2019m going to be there regardless.' The announcement triggered a market reaction, with the NASDAQ falling 3.6% and the S&P 500 dropping 2.7%. Current U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods stand at 30% due to alleged Chinese support for the fentanyl trade and unfair trade practices, while China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs are at 10%. Trump\u2019s announcement followed a lengthy post on Truth Social where he claimed China had sent letters to countries worldwide about the rare earth export controls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[taipeitimes.com](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/10/12/2003845330)\n\n**Trump threatens tech export limits, new 100 per cent tariff on Chinese imports starting Nov. 1 or sooner**\nU.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, or sooner, in response to China's new export controls on rare earth elements and related technologies. The restrictions, announced by China on October 10, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain special approval for exporting rare earths and prohibit exports of products used in military goods. Trump described the move as 'shocking' and 'out of the blue,' claiming China is 'becoming very hostile' and holding the world 'captive' by restricting access to critical materials used in electronics, chips, lasers, and jet engines. He also stated that the U.S. would impose export controls on 'any and all critical software' from American firms. While Trump did not formally cancel a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a trip to South Korea, he expressed uncertainty about whether it would occur, saying, 'I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to have it.' The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% on the news, marking its worst day since April 2025, when similar tariff threats sparked fears of a global recession. Analysts note that Trump has a history of making high-stakes threats that he later withdraws, a pattern investors have dubbed the 'TACO' trade ('Trump Always Chickens Out'). Experts such as Sun Yun of the Stimson Center and Gracelin Baskaran of CSIS emphasize that while China\u2019s actions are disproportionate, there is still room for de-escalation and mutual negotiation. China controls 70% of global rare earth mining and 93% of permanent magnet production, giving it significant leverage. Craig Singleton of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies warned that Trump\u2019s post could end the recent tariff truce between the two nations, leading to 'mutually assured disruption.' The U.S. and China are also locked in broader trade tensions involving chip exports, soybean sales, and reciprocal port fees, with the situation remaining volatile as both sides prepare for high-stakes economic negotiations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 12:05 AM\nSource:[bnnbloomberg.ca](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tariffs/2025/10/10/trump-says-there-seems-to-be-no-reason-to-meet-xi-during-upcoming-asia-trip/)\n\n**Trump threatens to jack up tariffs on China over its new rare-earth controls**\nOn October 10, 2025, former President Donald Trump threatened to significantly increase U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in response to China's new export controls on rare-earth elements\u2014critical minerals used in semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries, jet engines, and defense weapons. The move, which took effect this week, lacks specified penalties in its English translation but was described by Trump as 'very hostile.' He announced that a 'massive increase of Tariffs' on Chinese imports is under consideration, along with other countermeasures. Trump also threatened to cancel a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later that month. Financial markets reacted negatively: the S&P 500 dropped 131 points (nearly 2%) to 6,664, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 624 points (1.3%), and the Nasdaq Composite declined nearly 600 points (2.6%). Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush attributed the sell-off to renewed trade tensions, calling the escalation a 'white-knuckle moment' for markets, especially for tech stocks, amid broader concerns about a potential bubble in AI-driven equities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 04:37 PM\nSource:[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-china-tariffs-rare-earth-elements/)\n\n**[Editorial] Ever-present risk**\nTensions in the US-China trade war have escalated after China announced export restrictions on rare earths on October 10, 2025. In response, former U.S. President Donald Trump declared he would impose an additional 100 percent tariff on all imports from China, effective November 1, raising total U.S. tariffs on China to 130 percent\u2014nearing the 145 percent rate previously imposed in April 2025 before a temporary truce. This new tariff effectively bans most Chinese exports to the U.S. Trump also announced export controls on critical software. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce stated it does not want a trade war but warned it would 'resolutely take corresponding measures' if the U.S. continues its current course. Trump indicated there is 'no reason' to proceed with a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. The renewed conflict has triggered global financial instability, with stock markets plunging in New York and Europe, raising fears of simultaneous recession and high inflation. South Korea is especially vulnerable: it depends on China for over 80 percent of its rare earth imports, which are vital for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and defense industries. China\u2019s new export controls extend to products containing more than 0.1 percent of domestically sourced rare earths or manufactured using Chinese technology. The additional U.S. tariff will shrink global trade and severely impact South Korea\u2019s export-driven economy. The Korean won has already strengthened to 1,430 per dollar, increasing financial market volatility. The Korean government is urged to stabilize foreign exchange markets, pursue currency swap agreements with the U.S., and accelerate efforts to secure alternative rare earth suppliers and develop overseas resources. While both Trump and Xi have not yet withdrawn from the APEC summit, a last-minute breakthrough remains possible\u2014but even a deal would not guarantee an end to the broader trade conflict. The Korea Herald warns that the risk of being caught in a sudden trade war between the two superpowers remains ever-present, necessitating long-term strategic planning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 08:56 PM\nSource:[The Korea Herald](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10592436)\n\n**Trump Threatens Massive Tariffs on China Over Rare Earth Minerals Export Controls**\nDonald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he is canceling his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, citing China's increasingly hostile stance. The move follows China's recent efforts to assert control over the export of rare earth minerals\u2014critical for electronics and electric vehicles\u2014by signaling potential restrictions on these materials and other products. In response, Trump declared plans to impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, effective November 1, 2025, alongside new export controls on critical software. This escalation reflects growing U.S.-China tensions over rare earth exports, which analysts say China now views as a powerful strategic lever. Ilaria Mazzocco of the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that China appears more confident in using these controls as a geopolitical tool, possibly marking a shift from the first Trump administration. Financial markets reacted sharply: the Dow Jones fell 1.9%, the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, and the Nasdaq declined 3.6%. Experts like Rush Doshi of the Council on Foreign Relations suggest further measures\u2014such as financial sanctions, semiconductor export controls, or an expanded 'transshipment' tariff\u2014could follow. Despite a 30% drop in U.S. imports from China this year, China remains the fourth-largest source of U.S. imports, indicating significant ongoing economic exposure.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 10:33 AM\nSource:[Bolsamania](https://www.bolsamania.com/capitalbolsa/noticias/economia/trump-sugiere-un-aumento-masivo-de-aranceles-a-china-esto-es-lo-que-hay-detras-de-la-amenaza--21029916.html)\n\n**Rare Earth Tensions: Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs on China, But Signals Possible Diplomatic Breathing Room**\nU.S. President Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, citing China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, and announced plans to restrict exports of critical software.

This follows China's recent imposition of stricter export controls on rare earth materials, which the U.S. views as economic retaliation. Trump also declared that the U.S. will tighten export controls on key software and add Boeing aircraft parts to the restricted list. He suggested that his scheduled summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2014planned for October 31 and November 1 during the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea\u2014could be canceled unless Beijing lifts its rare earth export restrictions and resumes purchasing U.S. agricultural products like soybeans. Trump labeled China\u2019s rare earth controls as 'unprecedented in international trade' and posted about the move on Truth Social. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce responded by stating that threatening others with excessive tariffs is not a path to coexistence and warned of firm countermeasures if the U.S. proceeds. Analysts interpret the escalation as part of a broader geopolitical power play ahead of the APEC summit and the November 10 expiration of a temporary tariff suspension. Despite earlier threats to cancel the meeting, Trump later told reporters that a summit could still occur, leaving room for negotiation. The U.S. currently levies a combined 55 percent tariff on Chinese goods, including a 20 percent duty related to fentanyl concerns, a 10 percent global tariff since April, and a 25 percent tariff under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 10:57 PM\nSource:[www.donga.com](https://www.donga.com/en/article/all/20251013/5896804/1)\n\n**Trump Says U.S. Will Hit China With 100% Additional Tariff Over Rare Earth Restrictions**\nOn October 12, 2025, former President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports and new export controls on critical software, effective November 1, 2025, in response to China\u2019s new export restrictions on rare earth elements, lithium batteries, and related technologies. The Chinese measures, which require foreign entities to obtain licenses for products containing as little as 0.1% Chinese rare earths or manufactured using Chinese processing technology, are set to take effect in early November. China processes approximately 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths, which are essential for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and military equipment, giving Beijing significant leverage over global supply chains. Trump stated that the move was a surprise given the previously stable U.S.-China relationship over the past six months and claimed other countries had expressed anger over China\u2019s actions. He also canceled a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, citing China\u2019s aggressive stance. The new U.S. tariffs could raise the average U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods above 150%. The dispute follows earlier tensions in April 2025, when China tightened rare earth exports, prompting supply chain concerns. A previous tariff truce had reduced U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from over 140% to an average of 57.6%, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods average 32.6%. The latest restrictions may be more disruptive, as many global tech firms may struggle to prove their products fall below the 0.1% threshold, requiring Chinese government approval for exports. Trump\u2019s announcement reflects U.S. leverage in advanced semiconductor technology and equipment, with American and allied companies controlling over 90% of global semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The federal government shutdown in the U.S. may have emboldened China, which interpreted it as a sign of domestic instability.

This new tariff adds to the existing 30% tariff, raising the total effective tariff rate to approximately 130%. The move follows China's recent restrictions on the export of 12 out of 17 rare earth metals\u2014critical for high-tech manufacturing such as semiconductors, electric vehicles, and defense systems\u2014by tightening licensing requirements for foreign companies using Chinese technologies or materials. Trump labeled China\u2019s actions as 'morally reprehensible' and 'hostile,' and threatened to cancel his scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, stating, 'It was planned to meet President Xi in two weeks at APEC, but now there is no reason to meet.' Financial markets reacted sharply: the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 878 points (1.9%), the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, and the Nasdaq declined 3.6%, with major technology stocks like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Tesla, and Qualcomm suffering significant losses. This escalation follows a period of relative trade d\u00e9tente after years of high tariffs under Trump\u2019s administration, raising global concerns about renewed trade warfare disrupting global supply chains and increasing economic uncertainty. The U.S. administration also described China\u2019s policies as 'hostile' and 'dangerous' to global trade, and Trump threatened to impose export controls on sensitive U.S.-developed software used by China. The developments signal November 2025 as a pivotal month for U.S.-China trade relations.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 09:21 AM\nSource:[annahar.com](https://www.annahar.com/Economy/249874/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A9-100-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-1-%D9%86%D9%88%D9%81%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B1)\n\n**Trump Imposes 100% Tariffs in Response to China's Rare Earth Export Controls: A Renewed Trade Conflict**\nIn response to China's new export controls on rare earth materials, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on October 11, 2025, the imposition of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, effective November 1, 2025, and new export restrictions on 'critical software.' This move reignited trade tensions between the U.S. and China after months of relative calm. The announcement followed China's October 9 decree restricting exports of rare earth materials, related technologies, and products involving AI, logic chips, and memory chips, requiring approval for any product containing 0.1% or more of Chinese-sourced rare earths. The new rules also restrict exports to companies linked with foreign militaries and impose new limitations on equipment for electric vehicle batteries. China produces about 70% of the world\u2019s rare earth, and 90% of global rare earth refining is done in China, making the new controls a major concern for global supply chains. U.S. tech stocks suffered significantly, with Nvidia dropping nearly 5%, AMD falling nearly 8%, and the broader semiconductor sector declining over 5%. The announcement triggered a sharp market reaction: the Dow Jones fell nearly 900 points, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, its worst single-day decline since April. Trump initially threatened to cancel a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, but later indicated the tariff could be withdrawn before November 1 and that the meeting was not necessarily off. The U.S. government, particularly Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, expressed outrage, with some officials calling for a 'reset' of negotiations. Analysts suggest China may have implemented the controls to strengthen its bargaining position ahead of the Xi-Trump meeting, but experts like Stimson Center\u2019s Sun Yun and former USCBC Chairman Craig Allen believe both sides are overconfident, making compromise difficult. However, Quincy Institute\u2019s Jake Werner noted that Trump has previously threatened to 'destroy' U.S.-China relations but always returned to talks, as both nations recognize the mutual damage they can inflict. The crisis remains containable, with the U.S. tariff deadline set for November 1 and China\u2019s export control deadline for December 1, leaving a window for diplomatic resolution.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/124373/9063534)\n\n**Trump threatens tech export limits, new 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting Nov 1 or sooner**\nOn October 11, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he would impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, or sooner, citing China\u2019s recent export controls on rare earth elements as justification. The announcement, made after financial markets closed, triggered immediate market volatility, with the S&P 500 dropping 2.7%, its worst day since April 2025.

Analysts such as Wendy Cutler and Cole McFaul highlighted the fragility of recent diplomatic de-escalation, with China viewing itself as having gained concessions in past talks. Craig Singleton of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies warned that the situation could mark the 'beginning of the end' of the tariff truce, with both nations now reaching for economic weapons. The threat risks reigniting a trade war that previously saw U.S. tariffs reach 145% and Chinese counter-tariffs at 125%, effectively blocking trade.

The Chinese government now requires foreign companies to obtain special approval to ship rare earth elements abroad and has imposed permitting requirements on exports of technologies used in mining, smelting, and recycling rare earths, with military-related exports rejected outright.

The move, which would raise the effective tariff rate on many goods to 130% due to prior levies, was framed as retaliation for what Trump called Beijing\u2019s 'surprise' and 'hostile' actions. Trump also pledged to withhold 'critical software' from China and canceled his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, calling China\u2019s export restrictions a 'moral disgrace.' The announcement triggered a sharp market reaction, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping nearly 900 points on Friday. China justified its rare earth export controls as necessary for 'safeguarding national security and interests,' restricting overseas support for rare earth mining, smelting, and recycling activities without permission. In retaliation, China announced it would impose docking fees on U.S. ships entering Chinese ports starting October 14, 2025, mirroring a U.S. fee on Chinese vessels. Trump criticized the timing of China\u2019s move, noting it coincided with a U.S.-brokered hostage deal in Gaza and ongoing efforts to secure Chinese purchases of American soybeans\u2014efforts that have failed as China shifted to South American suppliers.

    "summary": "Across all expert domains\u2014international trade law, US government policy, political science, economics, and China studies\u2014there is overwhelming agreement that the probability of Donald Trump's announced 100% tariff on China actually taking effect on November 1, 2025, is low but not zero. Experts converge on several key points: (1) Trump has a well-documented history ('TACO' pattern) of threatening maximalist tariffs and then walking them back, often after market turmoil and last-minute negotiations; (2) The sharp market sell-off and economic risks create strong political incentives to delay or moderate such moves, especially with an impending election cycle; (3) The upcoming Trump-Xi meeting at the October 31 APEC summit provides a diplomatic window for a negotiated de-escalation, as is typical for these trade crises; (4) Legal and procedural hurdles could also delay formal implementation, even if the threat is maintained for leverage; (5) China's rare earth leverage and new export controls increase the seriousness and stakes but also provide both sides reason to seek an off-ramp rather than risk mutual economic harm; (6) Only in a scenario of complete diplomatic breakdown, where Trump prioritizes domestic political image or feels he has no choice, could the tariff realistically take effect. Expert forecast probabilities range from 15% (most common) to 32%, with a consensus clustering around 15\u201325%. The base rate for Trump following through on such extreme tariff threats is historically very low. In summary, the most likely outcome is a diplomatic compromise, delay, or suspension of the tariffs before November 1, while a sudden full implementation remains a real but unlikely risk.",
