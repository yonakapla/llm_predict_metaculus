Additionally, the short time window (less than 3 months) and the absence of recent warning signals further decrease the likelihood that a qualifying epidemiological event could occur, be detected, and be officially declared in time.

The consensus among these experts is that even if a virological shift were to occur, the timeline for detection, confirmation, and formal declaration is likely too short for a PHEIC to be declared before 2026. The new IHR regime, which raises the threshold for PHEIC by introducing a higher alert level, is also a critical consideration.

The original question opened on 2024-12-12 17:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/30763). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAccording to the WHO, the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations (IHR) [consists](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-international-health-regulations-and-emergency-committees) \"of international experts who provide technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a 'public health emergency of international concern' (PHEIC).\" Important factors the Emergency Committee weighs in its deliberation process are:\n\n1. risks to human health\n2. international spread of the outbreak, and\n3. interference with international travel.\n\nThe final determination of a PHEIC is made by the Director-General of the WHO.\n\nIn recent years, the WHO has declared a PHEIC for the [2022-2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_mpox_outbreak) and [2023-2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%932024_mpox_epidemic) mpox outbreaks, the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), the 2018-2020 [ebola outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivu_Ebola_epidemic), and the 2015-2016 [Zika epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Zika_virus_epidemic).\n\nWith respect to H5, at the time of this question the WHO [assesses the risk](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON512) as follows:\n\n> Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in birds, there is a risk for sporadic infections in mammals and humans due to exposure to infected animals (including livestock), or contaminated environments and thus, further human cases are not unexpected.  Influenza A infection has been rarely reported in bovine species and spread among dairy cattle herds in four U.S. States is being assessed. Previously, there have been human infections with other avian influenza subtypes following exposure to infected mammals.\n\n> Since the virus has not acquired mutations that facilitate transmission among humans and based on available information, WHO assesses the public health risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons the risk of infection is considered low-to-moderate.\n\n> There are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5 infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (from human cases and animal) and comprehensive investigations around human cases are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.\n\nFor more information please see:\n\n* US Centers for Disease Control [H5 Bird Flu: Current Situation](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html)\n* WHO [Risk assessments and summaries of influenza at the human-animal interface](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/avian-influenza/monthly-risk-assessment-summary)\n* Pan American Health Organization [Epidemiological alerts and updates](https://www.paho.org/en/epidemiological-alerts-and-updates)\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

Three deaths have been reported since the outbreak began on May 15, 2025, with one person currently hospitalized. Cases have been confirmed in all 16 regions and approximately 100 districts across the country. The GHS emphasized it remains vigilant, actively monitoring the outbreak through its surveillance system and coordinating with the Ministry of Health to implement public health measures, including contact tracing. Director General Prof. Samuel Kaba Akoriyea urged the public to remain calm, stating that existing protocols for detecting, managing, and controlling infectious diseases are being rigorously followed. The GHS advised the public to practice good hygiene, avoid close contact with symptomatic individuals, refrain from touching rashes or body fluids, use protective gear when caring for the sick, and report suspected cases. Symptoms of Mpox include rash, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. The GHS recommended frequent handwashing, wearing masks, covering lesions, keeping skin dry, avoiding shared items, disinfecting shared spaces, and using saltwater rinses for mouth sores. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Mpox a public health emergency of international concern in August 2024 due to a new variant spreading across Africa. Over 13 African countries have reported cases, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and 517 deaths recorded on the continent by the end of 2024. The WHO approved an Mpox vaccine in 2024 to improve access for millions at risk, as the outbreak has now infected over 20,000 people in Africa.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 09:23 PM\nSource:[Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd.](https://www.modernghana.com/news/1438780/ghanas-mpox-cases-rise-to-670-with-three-deaths.html)\n\n**Covid-19: Still Present After Five Years**\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, though no longer dominating media headlines due to competing global crises, remains active five years after the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In October 2025, a new wave of infections\u2014designated the 15th\u2014has emerged in Europe and the United States, driven by the XFG variant, a descendant of Omicron labeled 'Frankenstein.' In France, there has been a 16% weekly increase in suspected adult cases and a 17% rise among children aged 2 to 14 since September. The XFG variant now dominates viral circulation in Europe and the U.S., contributing to this resurgence. Experts from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (Cidrap) had previously predicted a pattern of recurring peaks and troughs in infections, confirming that the virus continues to follow this cyclical trend. In France, the 2025 vaccination campaign for vulnerable populations begins on October 14, with continued recommendations for the elderly and high-risk individuals due to the vaccine\u2019s proven protection against severe illness and long Covid. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Robert Kennedy Jr., a known anti-vaccine figure appointed by the administration, has led experts to question the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, rejecting official recommendations. Globally, the persistence of Covid-19 underscores the urgent need for pandemic preparedness. The World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) pandemic agreement, adopted in May 2025, aims to improve global coordination by ensuring equitable access to vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics, strengthening national health systems, enhancing surveillance and data sharing, and establishing mechanisms for international response during health emergencies.

The event, organized by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries and supported by the Pan American Health Organization, experts from Belize, and the Caribbean Public Health Agency, focuses on integrating human, animal, and environmental health perspectives. According to Radjesh Ori, acting director of the Bureau of Public Health (BOG), the workshop aligns with the One Health approach, emphasizing that 'everything is interconnected'\u2014climate change and shifting living conditions affect both human and animal health. Although Suriname has not yet reported any confirmed cases, Ori warns that global trends show increasing animal infections, with the risk of viral mutation enabling human-to-human transmission, potentially triggering a pandemic larger than COVID-19. The workshop uses the WHO\u2019s Mosaic Framework and other international assessment tools to identify gaps in planning, documentation, and coordination. Ori notes that while Suriname does much in public health, it underperforms in recording and systematizing plans. Experts from Belize are guiding field exercises based on their national experience.

Organized by the Ministry of Public Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (LVV), and supported by PAHO, Belizean experts, and the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), the workshop aims to strengthen national preparedness for a potential avian influenza outbreak. Radjesh Ori, acting director of the Bureau of Public Health (BOG), emphasized the One Health approach, stating that human, animal, and environmental health are interconnected, with climate change and shifting living conditions affecting both. Although Suriname has not yet reported any confirmed cases of bird flu, Ori warned that the absence of cases does not guarantee safety. He cautioned that if the virus mutates to become transmissible from human to human, it could trigger a pandemic larger than COVID-19. Participants used international evaluation tools, including the WHO\u2019s mosaic framework, to identify vulnerabilities and gaps, with the goal of formulating concrete recommendations for a sustainable action plan. Ori noted that while Suriname has strong initiatives, it lacks systematic documentation of plans\u2014this workshop aims to improve that. A key component is a field exercise guided by experts from Belize, who have previously conducted similar simulations.

The funds, requested to support efforts until June 2016, will be used to fast-track vaccine development, improve diagnostics, and study virus transmission and control. WHO declared a global public health emergency in February 2016, noting the virus's shift from a minor threat to a serious concern due to its association with severe complications. The requested funds include $25 million for WHO and its regional offices, with the rest allocated to partners like UNICEF. Initially, WHO used a $2 million emergency contingency fund to launch operations. Georgetown University professor Lawrence Gostin criticized the limited emergency fund, citing the slow WHO response during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak, which killed over 11,300 people. Brazil, the hardest-hit country, reported over 4,442 suspected microcephaly cases, with 508 confirmed and 41 linked to Zika infection. No treatment exists for Zika, which was previously considered a mild illness. However, research progress is underway: 15 companies and academic groups are developing vaccines, and Inovio Pharmaceuticals reported a robust immune response in mice, causing its shares to rise 7% on the news. The company plans to begin human trials by year-end.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2016 08:56 PM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/02/17/who-seeking-56-million-to-help-fight-zika-hope-of-vaccine-moves-forward.html)\n\n**Ghana's Mpox cases rise to 670 with three deaths**\nAs of October 8, 2025, Ghana has recorded 670 cases of Mpox, including 13 new infections, according to the Ghana Health Service (GHS).

According to Radjesh Ori, acting director of the Bureau of Public Health (BOG), the workshop aligns with the One Health approach, emphasizing that 'everything is interconnected'\u2014climate change and shifting living conditions affect both human and animal health. Although Suriname has not yet reported any confirmed cases, Ori warns that global trends show increasing animal infections, with the risk of viral mutation enabling human-to-human transmission, potentially triggering a pandemic larger than COVID-19. The workshop uses the WHO\u2019s Mosaic Framework and other international assessment tools to identify gaps in planning, documentation, and coordination. Ori notes that while Suriname does much in public health, it underperforms in recording and systematizing plans. Experts from Belize are guiding field exercises based on their national experience. The ultimate goal, as stated by Ori, is to gain insight into weaknesses and develop a sustainable action plan to improve readiness for any future outbreak.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[www.starnieuws.com](https://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/88590)\n\n**Respiratory Disease Outbreaks Intensify: Urging Implementation of Three Key Prevention Lines**\nSince October 1, 2025, free influenza and COVID-19 vaccines have been available in Taiwan. Experts warn that respiratory disease outbreaks have surged two months earlier than usual, highlighting ongoing threats from respiratory infections. According to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC), reported cases of COVID-19 and influenza have reached the highest levels in three years, with continued increases in influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection rates. Dr. Zhang Fengyi, President of the Taiwan Society of Infectious Diseases, emphasized that while COVID-19 has transitioned from a global acute pandemic to a\u5e38\u6001\u5316 (\u5e38\u6001\u5316 means 'normalization') endemic disease, it remains a serious threat. Multiple respiratory pathogens\u2014including influenza, RSV, and Streptococcus pneumoniae\u2014are now co-circulating, posing a heightened risk to individuals aged 65 and older, with co-infections potentially doubling mortality rates and increasing severe cases, thereby straining healthcare capacity. To mitigate risks, Dr. Zhang advocates for a 'three-line defense' strategy: widespread vaccination, routine rapid antigen testing, and early use of antiviral medications. Dr. Hsieh Hsien-sen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Taiwan Society of Infectious Diseases, reported that vaccination rates among high-risk groups remain low: only 20.3% of those aged 65+ received the JN.1 booster, 43.9% received the 2024 seasonal flu vaccine, and only 24.9% completed the two-dose pneumococcal vaccine series by April 2025. He stressed the critical gap between public awareness and actual behavior, urging high-risk individuals and their families to take proactive steps to protect themselves and others.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%91%BC%E5%90%B8%E9%81%93%E7%96%AB%E6%83%85%E5%8D%87%E6%BA%AB-%E8%90%BD%E5%AF%A63%E5%A4%A7%E9%98%B2%E7%B7%9A-220015040.html)\n\n**National Disease Control Agency: Safe Return, Monitor Your Health**\nThe National Disease Control and Prevention Administration (NDCPA) released health guidance on October 7, 2025, urging travelers returning from overseas to proactively declare any symptoms such as cough, fever, rash, or diarrhea before entering China. The guidance emphasizes that travelers must undergo temperature checks and medical inspections at entry points, and cooperate with customs on epidemiological investigations and medical examinations if needed, to determine potential infectious disease exposure and enable early treatment while reducing transmission risks. During travel, passengers are advised to wear masks properly in prolonged, enclosed, crowded public transport settings to reduce the risk of respiratory infections. Upon returning home, individuals should conduct self-health monitoring; if symptoms such as cough, fever, rash, or diarrhea occur, they should seek medical care promptly and inform healthcare providers of their travel history. This guidance aligns with the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism\u2019s recent notice, 'On Doing a Good Job in the Prevention and Control of Key Infectious Diseases, Including COVID-19, During and After the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival and in the Autumn-Winter Season,' which calls for unified thinking, heightened awareness, and proactive planning to ensure the overall stability of the national epidemic situation, supporting a favorable environment for socioeconomic development.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 09:36 AM\nSource:[news.cn](http://www.news.cn/politics/20251007/2c83e400d7c24a46b3a40ab872faac81/c.html)\n\n**Avian Influenza Outbreak Sparks Global Alarm: Spain Activates Emergency Protocol, Brazil Becomes Hotspot with 17,000 Chickens Dead**\nThe avian influenza virus has caused widespread fear and concern globally, particularly in Europe and Latin America. Spain activated a health emergency protocol after detecting a new outbreak in Alcobendas, following multiple cases in Andalusia, and ordered the culling of over 850 birds. Experts, including Spanish immunologist Alfredo Correl, emphasize that while human transmission remains rare\u2014only around 900 cases recorded globally since 1997\u2014the virus is highly lethal in poultry, causing 100% mortality among infected birds, and has a 30% to 50% fatality rate in confirmed human cases. Crucially, the virus currently does not spread from person to person, and experts believe it is unlikely to mutate for human-to-human transmission in the near future, as it benefits from host survival. Authorities stress that infected birds and all nearby poultry must be destroyed to prevent spread, and the public is advised not to touch dead birds and to wash hands thoroughly if contact occurs. Spain has identified nine outbreak sites, including in Seville\u2019s Parque Mar\u00eda Luisa and La Puerta del R\u00edo, with fears of further spread. In Brazil, the virus has become a major outbreak hotspot, with approximately 17,000 chickens dying in Rio Grande do Sul and preventive culling of remaining birds. Brazil has suspended poultry exports to the European Union, Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay; the EU partially lifted the ban after stabilization. Multiple Brazilian states have reported outbreaks, raising alarms over potential spread to large farms if preventive measures are not improved. Although human cases remain rare, experts from Spain and Latin America warn of 'shared risks' if the virus mutates to spread between species or appears in mammals.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:32 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/10/7/%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A5%D9%86%D9%81%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B2%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87/7146691)\n\n**Suriname Prepares for Bird Flu with International One Health Workshop**\nSuriname has launched a three-day One Health Workshop on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Utopia Heritage, running from October 6 to October 9, 2025. Organized by the Ministry of Public Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (LVV), and supported by PAHO, Belizean experts, and the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), the workshop aims to strengthen national preparedness for a potential avian influenza outbreak. Radjesh Ori, acting director of the Bureau of Public Health (BOG), emphasized the One Health approach, stating that human, animal, and environmental health are interconnected, with climate change and shifting living conditions affecting both. Although Suriname has not yet reported any confirmed cases of bird flu, Ori warned that the absence of cases does not guarantee safety. He cautioned that if the virus mutates to become transmissible from human to human, it could trigger a pandemic larger than COVID-19. Participants used international evaluation tools, including the WHO\u2019s mosaic framework, to identify vulnerabilities and gaps, with the goal of formulating concrete recommendations for a sustainable action plan. Ori noted that while Suriname has strong initiatives, it lacks systematic documentation of plans\u2014this workshop aims to improve that. A key component is a field exercise guided by experts from Belize, who have previously conducted similar simulations. The ultimate goal, as stated by Ori, is to gain insight into existing shortcomings and implement structural improvements to ensure effective response should avian influenza reach the country.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 05:35 PM\nSource:[culturu.com](https://www.culturu.com/nieuws/suriname/suriname-bereidt-zich-voor-op-vogelgriep-met-internationale-one-health-workshop/)\n\n**H3N2 influenza spreads rapidly in Delhi, northern India | Taiwan News | Oct. 1, 2025 14:27**\nThe H3N2 strain of influenza is spreading rapidly in northern India, particularly in the Delhi metropolitan region, which encompasses approximately 46 million people across Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. According to a LocalCircles survey, 69% of households in the area report at least one person with flu-like symptoms. Dr. Rituja Ugalmugle of Wockhardt Hospitals confirms H3N2 is the predominant variant, noting widespread circulation. Symptoms include sudden high fever, chills, sore throat, runny nose, dry or productive cough, severe fatigue, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal issues, especially in children. High-risk groups\u2014children, the elderly, pregnant individuals, and those with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease\u2014are most vulnerable. While most cases resolve within a week, complications such as bronchitis, pneumonia, or worsening of pre-existing conditions can occur, with some patients requiring hospitalization. Dr. Mayanka Lodha Seth of Redcliffe Labs emphasizes that H3N2 is typically more severe and longer-lasting than common flu or colds. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, blue lips or nails, confusion, and severe dehydration, requiring immediate medical attention. Preventive measures include handwashing, masking, avoiding crowds, healthy eating, and annual flu vaccination. There is no specific antiviral treatment; care focuses on symptom relief, with antivirals reserved for severe or high-risk cases. H3N2 originated from the 1968 pandemic, combining with an avian H3 virus, and has since evolved through human adaptation. A 2024 study found that receptor-binding changes in H3N2 have increased transmissibility and immune evasion. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently assesses the pandemic risk as low, but vigilance is ongoing due to H3N2\u2019s rapid mutation potential. Scientists monitor the virus closely, as significant mutations could lead to a sudden epidemic or pandemic.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 02:27 PM\nSource:[taiwannews.com.tw](https://taiwannews.com.tw/news/6209513)\n\n**WHO Enacts New Regulations**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) announced that on Friday the new International Health Regulations (IHR) went into force, allowing the declaration of 'pandemic emergencies' for severe global health crises such as the COVID\u201119 pandemic.

Until now the highest alert level was \"public health emergency of international concern\", which was used for COVID\u201119, Ebola, mpox, and influenza A. The new regulations introduce a second, more severe alert level. They also explicitly embed a principle of \"solidarity among countries\" to address the unequal access to vaccines and treatments that hampered the COVID\u201119 response, especially in low\u2011income nations. Additionally, the IHR establish a financial mechanism under the authority of the World Health Assembly to better coordinate resources. The amendments were adopted at the 2024 Assembly, the first major changes since the 2005 revision following the SARS outbreak. Eleven of the 194 member states, including the United States, rejected the new regulations; in those countries the 2005 IHR will remain in force.

WHO Director\u2011General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the threat remains and that global vigilance must continue, saying, 'This decision is based on sustained declines in cases -- as seen in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in other affected countries including Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda.' The emergency committee, which reviews Mpox status quarterly, lifted the PHEIC based on consistent evidence of falling infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda. The designation was first declared in August 2024 due to a more virulent Clade Ib strain. WHO clarified that lifting the emergency tag does not mean the virus is eradicated; high\u2011risk groups such as children, pregnant women and people living with HIV remain at higher risk of severe illness.\n\nWHO\u2019s latest surveillance update up to 31 March 2025 reports 137,892 confirmed cases (Jan\u202f2022\u2011Mar\u202f2025) and 317 deaths. The African Region accounts for 84.8\u202f% of cases, Europe 8.6\u202f%, and the Americas 5.6\u202f%. Notably, the African Region saw a 14\u202f% decline in cases in March\u202f2025 alone.\n\nIndia has reported about 40 confirmed Mpox cases and one death over the past five years, with the first case detected in Kerala in July\u202f2022. In late\u202f2024 to early\u202f2025, 10 cases of a newer Mpox strain were identified, mostly linked to travel or close contact with travellers. While India\u2019s caseload remains low compared to global figures, health officials emphasize continued vigilance and contact tracing.\n\nMpox is caused by the Monkeypox virus, part of the Orthopoxvirus family. The illness typically lasts two to four weeks, beginning with fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a rash that develops into blisters and scabs, often affecting the face, hands, feet or genital area.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 07:49 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/health/mpox-no-longer-a-global-emergency-but-who-warns-against-complacency-125090800441_1.html)\n\n**WHO: Mpox no longer an international health emergency**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The decision followed the fifth meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, which advised Director\u2011General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to lift the emergency status; he accepted the advice. The announcement states, 'The Committee advised the Director\u2011General Dr Tedros that the situation no longer represents an international health emergency. He accepted the advice. Lifting the emergency declaration does not mean the threat is over, as mpox outbreaks, including new ones, continue to be reported.' The Director\u2011General noted a sustained decline in cases and deaths in heavily affected countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, but emphasized that the removal of the emergency label does not mean the disease has been eradicated. He added, 'Mpox is still present, and countries must not let their guard down.'\n\nIn Kenya, mpox remains a growing concern. Ministry of Health data reported more than 314 confirmed cases by early August 2025, spread across 22 counties. Later humanitarian health updates indicated the tally had surpassed 330 cases in at least 24 counties, with Mombasa accounting for nearly half of the total. The coastal city and the Mombasa\u2011Malaba transport corridor have become epicentres of transmission, with many cases traced to truck drivers, sex workers, and their close contacts. The nation has reported several fatalities linked to the disease, underscoring the continued threat despite the WHO's declaration. The WHO has pledged continued support for Kenya and other African countries to maintain progress achieved during the emergency phase, and the Kenyan government has rolled out vaccination drives in several counties.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2025-09-06-who-mpox-no-longer-an-international-health-emergency)\n\n**WHO says mpox no longer a global public health emergency - The Statesman**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the spread of mpox (monkeypox) in Africa no longer constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

The WHO Director-General welcomed the participants and presented the objectives of the meeting, which were to determine whether the mpox outbreak still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and to formulate recommendations for temporary measures for States Parties. The WHO presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, including the circulation of all clades of the monkeypox virus (MPXV). The meeting discussed the recent developments in the mpox outbreak, including the stabilization or decline of cases in most provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the decrease in cases in Burundi, and the recent surge in cases in Sierra Leone. The WHO also presented its evaluation of the risk for different clades of MPXV, which includes a high risk for the DRC and neighboring countries, a moderate risk for the DRC, a moderate risk for Nigeria and countries in West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic, and a moderate risk for the world. The meeting also discussed the progress made in the fight against mpox, including the launch of vaccination campaigns in seven countries and the upcoming launch in four other countries. However, the WHO emphasized that the current progress is threatened by a growing funding deficit, which compromises not only the response efforts but also global health programs that support mpox prevention and control activities.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 10:04 AM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/quatrieme-reunion-du-comite-durgence-du-reglement-sanitaire-international-2005-concernant-la-recrudescence-de-la-mpox-variole-simienne-en-2024)\n\n**Global Health Alert: WHO Declares) Mpox a Public Health Emergency | Per Second News**\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the ongoing rise in cases, including a recent increase in West Africa, and likely ongoing undetected transmission in some countries beyond the African continent.

The outbreak, which may have begun in September 2023, is driven by a newly identified lineage, 'clade Ib', that is more efficient at human\u2011to\u2011human transmission than the previously known 'clade II' strains. The virus has spread across most DRC provinces and crossed national borders, overwhelming a health system already strained by Ebola, cholera and limited resources. Africa CDC estimates the continent needs about 10\u202fmillion doses of the Mpox vaccine, yet only roughly 200\u202f000 are currently available. The only approved vaccine, MVA\u2011BN (Modified Vaccinia Ankara\u2011Bavarian Nordic), is costly and largely unaffordable for many African countries. WHO has called for international solidarity, noting that Europe has the capacity to help but the supply gap remains a critical barrier. In June 2024, the World Health Assembly adopted amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) to improve global preparedness, though they have not yet taken effect. WHO has identified an immediate funding need of $15\u202fmillion for surveillance, preparedness and response, but has released only $1.45\u202fmillion from its contingency fund. The article stresses that addressing Mpox requires coordinated vaccine access, strengthened testing and monitoring, health\u2011care service improvement, public\u2011health education, behavioral change promotion, and economic support for affected communities. It concludes that global health security depends on collective action and sustained investment to prevent future outbreaks from escalating into worldwide crises.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 24, 2024 06:07 PM\nSource:[weeklyblitz.net](https://weeklyblitz.net/2024/08/25/new-mpox-strain-sparks-global-health-emergency/)\n\n**WHO Seeking $56 Million to Help Fight Zika, Hope of Vaccine Moves Forward**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called for $56 million to combat the rapidly spreading Zika virus, which has been confirmed in 39 countries and linked to birth defects such as microcephaly and neurological disorders like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The funds, requested to support efforts until June 2016, will be used to fast-track vaccine development, improve diagnostics, and study virus transmission and control. WHO declared a global public health emergency in February 2016, noting the virus's shift from a minor threat to a serious concern due to its association with severe complications. The requested funds include $25 million for WHO and its regional offices, with the rest allocated to partners like UNICEF. Initially, WHO used a $2 million emergency contingency fund to launch operations. Georgetown University professor Lawrence Gostin criticized the limited emergency fund, citing the slow WHO response during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak, which killed over 11,300 people. Brazil, the hardest-hit country, reported over 4,442 suspected microcephaly cases, with 508 confirmed and 41 linked to Zika infection. No treatment exists for Zika, which was previously considered a mild illness. However, research progress is underway: 15 companies and academic groups are developing vaccines, and Inovio Pharmaceuticals reported a robust immune response in mice, causing its shares to rise 7% on the news. The company plans to begin human trials by year-end.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2016 08:56 PM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/02/17/who-seeking-56-million-to-help-fight-zika-hope-of-vaccine-moves-forward.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of the WHO declaring H5 avian influenza a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) before 2026 is low. Their forecasts range from 6% to 12%, with most clustering between 7% and 8%. Across global health governance, risk assessment, epidemiology, public health policy, and virology perspectives, the main factors driving a low probability are: (1) the absence of confirmed sustained human-to-human transmission; (2) the status quo WHO risk assessment, which classifies risk to the general population as low; (3) the historical base rate\u2014no PHEIC has ever been declared for avian influenza, despite recurring animal outbreaks; and (4) recent changes to International Health Regulations (IHR), which may further raise the PHEIC threshold by introducing a higher 'pandemic emergency' category. Minor upward pressure on probability comes from the theoretical risk of mutations or sudden epidemiological shifts, as well as heightened global readiness and surveillance post-COVID, but these are not considered imminent. The short remaining window (about 2.5 months) further lowers likelihood, as a dramatic change would need to be detected, verified, and acted upon very rapidly to meet the deadline. Most experts conclude that unless a sudden, high-profile cluster of human-to-human transmission occurs, or a significant mutation is detected, no PHEIC will be declared, and avian influenza will remain primarily an animal and agricultural health issue at this time.",
