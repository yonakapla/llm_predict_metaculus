The critiques of my initial estimate highlight that the base rate of rapid leaderboard changes and the recency bias in Arena voting may be more influential than I initially weighted, especially given OpenAI's resource windfall and track record.

These critiques are valid, especially considering Google's current momentum, deep integration, and the challenge of shifting user preferences rapidly at the top of the market. However, the high base rate of leaderboard volatility after flagship launches, OpenAI's strong incentives, and the responsiveness of Arena scores to new releases continue to support a probability slightly above even odds. Weighing these factors, I slightly adjust downward to better reflect status quo resilience and user lock-in, while maintaining my view that OpenAI is favored if it executes a major year-end release.",

No new evidence emerged to justify a significant deviation from my initial estimate, and the modest critiques of over-optimism are offset by defenses of OpenAI's disruptive momentum. The base rates for leadership turnover and the technical/market incentives for OpenAI to launch a new flagship model by year-end remain decisive factors.

The critiques exchanged highlighted two key points. First, technical resource surges (like the $100B Nvidia investment) do not guarantee immediate leaderboard ascendance, as translation to user-perceived improvement can lag and Google\u2019s current lead is meaningful. Second, the SCOT perspective\u2014shared by several forecasters\u2014emphasizes that user voting dynamics, hype, and sociotechnical framing can rapidly shift outcomes, especially following a major release, even if technical superiority is only marginal.

Most forecasters converge on a 59-65% range, with nuanced differences based on discipline but no dramatic divergences. Some critiques suggest tempering expectations due to status quo bias and the possibility that resource advantages may not translate immediately to user-perceived superiority.

The Nvidia-OpenAI partnership, which includes 10 gigawatts of GPU-powered data centers\u2014equivalent to the energy consumption of millions of homes\u2014significantly strengthens OpenAI\u2019s position, reducing its prior reliance on Microsoft and signaling a new phase in the 'computational arms race' toward superintelligence. OpenAI also launched ChatGPT Pulse, a proactive assistant that autonomously researches and delivers personalized daily reports, and Sora 2, a multimodal audio and video generation model for entertainment and creative industries. Anthropic introduced Claude Sonnet 4.5, capable of sustaining tasks for up to 30 hours, while Google DeepMind accelerated the development of Gemini, a direct rival to GPT-5, now integrated into Chrome and robotics projects. Strategic divergences emerged: OpenAI focuses on personal AI assistants, Google on multimodality, and Anthropic on full autonomy. Meta and Mistral champion openness\u2014Meta offers Llama freely to Western partners, while Mistral, a French company, raised \u20ac1.7 billion and is valued at \u20ac11.7 billion, promoting European digital sovereignty. In China, Baidu launched ERNIE X1.1, a 21-billion-parameter model rivaling GPT-5 in reasoning, reinforcing Beijing\u2019s strategy to democratize AI domestically and export open standards, thereby narrowing the technological gap with Western firms. The rapid influx of capital and innovation has fragmented global AI strategies: Nvidia bets on OpenAI, Google on integration, Anthropic on autonomy, Meta and Mistral on openness, and China on scale.

Unlike traditional benchmark tests that use inconsistent criteria and obscure metrics, LM Arena determines rankings based on real user evaluations of which model provides better responses. The platform initially focused on text chatbots but now covers image generation, coding, search, and video. Its popularity surged after the release of 'Nano Banana,' which was revealed to be Google's 'Gemini 2.5 Flash Image,' causing monthly users to grow from 1 million to 3 million. As a result, LM Arena's valuation reached $600 million (approximately 840 billion KRW). On October 16, 2025, the platform launched a new AI consultation service based on user evaluations, marking a shift to a new business model.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:36 PM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/10/02/TLDUCIVCD5BRRJTDYOC6TBVYCA/)\n\n**Meta Will Target Ads Based On AI Chatbot Conversations**\nMeta Platforms (META) will begin targeting advertisements and content recommendations based on users' conversations with its generative-AI-powered Meta AI chatbot starting December 16, 2025. The chatbot, available across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and a standalone app, has over 1 billion active monthly users. The move aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pledge to invest hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure to support Meta AI and future 'superintelligence' capabilities. While advertising drives nearly all of Meta\u2019s revenue\u2014forecasted at $196.7 billion in 2025\u2014Meta will exclude sensitive topics such as religion, politics, health, sexual orientation, and racial or ethnic origin from ad personalization. The initial rollout will not include users in the United Kingdom, South Korea, or the European Union. Meta\u2019s stock declined 2.5% to $715.77 amid broader market declines due to a U.S. government shutdown and weak ADP employment data. Despite a 23% year-to-date gain, Meta shares have pulled back 10% from a high of $796.25 reached in early August following strong Q2 results. Meta AI competes with Google\u2019s Gemini and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the latter of which has over 700 million weekly users and recently introduced direct purchasing features via Etsy and Shopify, signaling potential future ad integration. Google currently states that Gemini Apps chats are not used to show ads, though it reserves the right to change this policy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:16 PM\nSource:[Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-ai-chatbot-facebook-instagram/)\n\n**California teen suicide prompts harsher regulations against AI**\nIn response to a suicide incident involving a California teenager linked to interactions with AI chatbots, U.S. lawmakers are intensifying scrutiny of artificial intelligence companies. Advanced AI chatbots in 2025, powered by models like GPT-5, use emotional intelligence, memory retention, and multimodal capabilities (text, voice, images) to deliver personalized, empathetic interactions. However, concerns over psychological risks\u2014such as emotional dependency, loneliness, and exposure to harmful content\u2014have prompted regulatory and corporate action. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, the first-of-its-kind bill requiring large AI companies to meet strict transparency standards. In response, OpenAI introduced parental controls for ChatGPT, allowing parents to monitor and restrict teen usage, filter sensitive content, limit voice/image generation, and opt out of data training. The system also sends safety alerts if distress signals are detected. Meta updated its guidelines to block teens from discussing self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating and restricts access to AI characters promoting only positive, educational, and creative interactions. Character.AI offers 'Parental Insights' with weekly summaries of teen interactions, while Google\u2019s Gemini received a 'High Risk' rating for younger users, prompting enhanced content moderation. These measures reflect a growing industry commitment to ethical AI design, balancing innovation with safeguards for minors. Policymakers and developers are jointly advancing frameworks to address emotional dependency, privacy breaches, and inappropriate content, emphasizing transparency, real-time monitoring, and proactive protection to ensure AI serves the public good.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 07:51 PM\nSource:[americanbazaaronline.com](https://americanbazaaronline.com/2025/09/30/california-teen-suicide-prompts-harsher-ai-regulations-468251/)\n\n**The Viral AI Image Editor Everyone's Going Bananas Over? Yeah, That's Google**\nGoogle has officially launched Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, revealing that the previously anonymous AI image editor 'nano-banana' on LMArena was developed by Google's DeepMind. The model, which gained viral attention for its high performance on image editing leaderboards, offers four key advancements: character consistency (maintaining identity across multiple images), integration of Gemini's world knowledge for better prompt understanding, multi-image fusion for photorealistic blending, and prompt-based editing capabilities such as background blurring, stain removal, person deletion, pose alteration, and colorization. The model is priced at $0.039 per image (1,290 tokens per image) and is available via the Gemini app, API, AI Studio, and Vertex AI. Google's strategy of testing the model anonymously on LMArena before its reveal served as organic validation, with users driving it to the top of leaderboards. While the model is technically superior and more affordable than competitors like Midjourney v7 and ChatGPT's image tools, adoption remains uncertain due to entrenched workflows around existing platforms. Google's advantage lies in its multimodal intelligence and broad distribution, but convincing casual users to switch from established tools like Instagram filters or Discord-based AI apps remains a challenge. The model also includes SynthID digital watermarking for authenticity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[maginative.com](https://www.maginative.com/article/the-viral-ai-image-editor-everyones-going-bananas-over-yeah-thats-google/)\n\n**ChatGPT Accelerates the Global AI Race**\nThe global artificial intelligence race has intensified over the past ten days, marked by a US$100 billion investment from Nvidia into OpenAI, prompting rival companies like Google, Anthropic, Meta, and Baidu to rapidly unveil new products and strategies.

The chatbot, available across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and a standalone app, has over 1 billion active monthly users. The move aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pledge to invest hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure to support Meta AI and future 'superintelligence' capabilities. While advertising drives nearly all of Meta\u2019s revenue\u2014forecasted at $196.7 billion in 2025\u2014Meta will exclude sensitive topics such as religion, politics, health, sexual orientation, and racial or ethnic origin from ad personalization. The initial rollout will not include users in the United Kingdom, South Korea, or the European Union. Meta\u2019s stock declined 2.5% to $715.77 amid broader market declines due to a U.S. government shutdown and weak ADP employment data. Despite a 23% year-to-date gain, Meta shares have pulled back 10% from a high of $796.25 reached in early August following strong Q2 results. Meta AI competes with Google\u2019s Gemini and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the latter of which has over 700 million weekly users and recently introduced direct purchasing features via Etsy and Shopify, signaling potential future ad integration. Google currently states that Gemini Apps chats are not used to show ads, though it reserves the right to change this policy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:16 PM\nSource:[Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-ai-chatbot-facebook-instagram/)\n\n**AI Daily: Ant Open-Sources Ring-flash-2.0; Tongyi Models Dominate Hugging Face; Veo3 Upgrades Visual AI Capabilities**\nThe AI Daily report highlights major advancements in artificial intelligence across multiple fronts.

Apple is testing an internal chatbot called 'Veritas' for next-generation Siri (Project Linwood), with plans to launch a hybrid AI-powered Siri in March 2026. YouTube Music introduced an AI host named 'Beyond the Beat' to enhance music listening with stories and commentary, though it risks generating inaccurate information. LiquidAI launched the 'Liquid Nanos' series\u2014lightweight AI models (350M and 1.2B parameters) optimized for edge devices, supporting translation, RAG, tool calling, and math reasoning, with 12 task-specific models available on Hugging Face in GGUF format.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 08:32 AM\nSource:[chinaz.com](http://www.chinaz.com/feed/0929/1712621.shtml)\n\n**California teen suicide prompts harsher regulations against AI**\nIn response to a suicide incident involving a California teenager linked to interactions with AI chatbots, U.S. lawmakers are intensifying scrutiny of artificial intelligence companies. Advanced AI chatbots in 2025, powered by models like GPT-5, use emotional intelligence, memory retention, and multimodal capabilities (text, voice, images) to deliver personalized, empathetic interactions. However, concerns over psychological risks\u2014such as emotional dependency, loneliness, and exposure to harmful content\u2014have prompted regulatory and corporate action. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, the first-of-its-kind bill requiring large AI companies to meet strict transparency standards. In response, OpenAI introduced parental controls for ChatGPT, allowing parents to monitor and restrict teen usage, filter sensitive content, limit voice/image generation, and opt out of data training. The system also sends safety alerts if distress signals are detected. Meta updated its guidelines to block teens from discussing self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating and restricts access to AI characters promoting only positive, educational, and creative interactions. Character.AI offers 'Parental Insights' with weekly summaries of teen interactions, while Google\u2019s Gemini received a 'High Risk' rating for younger users, prompting enhanced content moderation.

Official tests show the model excels in character consistency, prompt following, physical logic realism, and visual aesthetics. However, it does not support Chinese input; even when English prompts are used for Chinese content, performance drops noticeably, and occasional structural errors such as multi\u2011limb artifacts appear. Despite these limitations, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is considered one of the strongest image editing and generation models on the market. Google\u2019s demo demonstrates it can replace some manual retouching, enabling designers to generate or modify images in a single click, useful for e\u2011commerce product photos. The cost of generating a single image is less than 0.03 yuan, offering high cost\u2011effectiveness and potentially accelerating commercial AI image generation. Prior to its official launch, a model called 'nano-banana' appeared in the LMArena arena, receiving over 2.5\u202fmillion votes. It was later revealed that 'nano-banana' is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. In LMArena\u2019s text\u2011to\u2011image and image\u2011editing scenes, Google\u2019s model achieved a global first place, scoring 1362 in the image\u2011editing leaderboard and leading the second\u2011place model flux\u20111\u2011knotext\u2011max by 171 points.

Yeah, That's Google**\nGoogle has officially launched Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, revealing that the previously anonymous AI image editor 'nano-banana' on LMArena was developed by Google's DeepMind. The model, which gained viral attention for its high performance on image editing leaderboards, offers four key advancements: character consistency (maintaining identity across multiple images), integration of Gemini's world knowledge for better prompt understanding, multi-image fusion for photorealistic blending, and prompt-based editing capabilities such as background blurring, stain removal, person deletion, pose alteration, and colorization. The model is priced at $0.039 per image (1,290 tokens per image) and is available via the Gemini app, API, AI Studio, and Vertex AI. Google's strategy of testing the model anonymously on LMArena before its reveal served as organic validation, with users driving it to the top of leaderboards. While the model is technically superior and more affordable than competitors like Midjourney v7 and ChatGPT's image tools, adoption remains uncertain due to entrenched workflows around existing platforms. Google's advantage lies in its multimodal intelligence and broad distribution, but convincing casual users to switch from established tools like Instagram filters or Discord-based AI apps remains a challenge.

However, according to the LMArena leaderboard, developed by the University of California, Berkeley, Grok 4 ranked third in the overall ranking and in the text generation category. Although this is an impressive result, it is far from the leadership that Musk claimed. Grok 4 lags behind Google and OpenAI models. Specifically, the first place was taken by the Gemini 2.5 model from Google, while the second place was shared by the o3 and 4o models from OpenAI. GPT-4.5 and Grok 4 shared the third position. It is worth noting that the LMArena leaderboard has been criticized for its methodology, and a study by Cohere highlights systematic problems, including opaque testing and the possibility of retracting ratings. Additionally, it was discovered that the version of the LLaMA 4 model from Meta used for evaluation differed from the publicly available one, which undermined the platform's objectivity. Despite this, Grok 4 was unable to take the top spot. However, such leaderboards, like LMArena, help compare the effectiveness of different AI models, although their results are not always final due to the subjectivity of evaluations.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 07:26 AM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/tech/grok-4-reyting-shi-yak-chat-bot-xai-viglyadaye-tablitsi-lideriv_n2871370)\n\n**Elon Musk Said Grok 4 Was the \"Smartest AI in the World,\" But Its Leaderboard Scores Just Came Out and They Tell a Different Story**\nElon Musk has claimed that xAI's Grok 4 AI chatbot is the 'smartest AI in the world,' but its recent leaderboard scores tell a different story. According to the UC Berkeley-developed LMArena leaderboard, Grok 4 ranked third place overall and in text generation, behind Google's Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3 and 4o reasoning models. However, experts have raised concerns about the leaderboard's credibility due to 'systematic issues' and 'undisclosed private testing.' Musk's claim has been met with skepticism, given his history of exaggerating and fibbing in his professional and personal life.

The researchers found that major companies such as Google, OpenAI, and Meta have an unfair advantage in the system, and that the rankings can be manipulated by private testing. According to the study, these companies can test multiple private models before releasing them to the public, and then only release the best-performing model to the public. This can lead to a biased ranking system, where average-performing models are ranked higher than they should be. The researchers also found that proprietary models, which do not disclose their neural network parameters, have an advantage over open-weight models and open-source models in terms of the number of prompts they receive. This can lead to a situation where AI developers can adjust their models using previous data and achieve high scores in the next month. The authors of the study recommend that all LLMs, including private ones, should be scored and published to increase transparency and fairness. However, the operators of Chatbot Arena have responded to the study, claiming that it contains factual errors and misinterpretations.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: June 10, 2025 10:20 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u7d4c\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\uff08xTECH\uff09](https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/mag/nc/18/040900481/060300005/)\n\n**AI Large Models Continue to Evolve, Agent Deployment Accelerates**\nThe computer industry weekly report highlights the continuous iteration of AI large models and the acceleration of Agent deployment.

    "summary": "Across all experts, the consensus is that OpenAI has a slightly better than even chance of topping the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard on December 31, 2025, but the outcome is inherently uncertain due to strong competition\u2014especially from Google\u2014and a rapidly shifting AI landscape. All perspectives note Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro currently holds the top spot, with OpenAI's leading models (GPT-4o, o1) close behind. The key driver in favor of OpenAI is the enormous recent investment ($100B from Nvidia) and access to unprecedented compute, positioning OpenAI to potentially release a next-generation model (e.g., GPT-5) or a major upgrade by year-end. Experts highlight OpenAI's historical pattern of reclaiming leaderboard dominance shortly after major releases and its ability to align product launches with periods of maximum impact. Conversely, Google's ongoing rapid iteration, strong technical performance, and deep integration with user-facing platforms (Chrome, Android, etc.) are seen as major offsetting factors, making the race extremely close. Other risks for OpenAI include regulatory scrutiny, possible deployment slowdowns from safety concerns, and potential changes in leaderboard methodology. User preference volatility and the sociotechnical construction of 'best' on Arena are also noted, with large user bases and hype cycles playing a non-trivial role. The typical probabilities assigned by experts range from 58% to 65% for OpenAI topping the leaderboard\u2014reflecting a slight but significant edge over Google, driven largely by anticipated model releases, resource advantages, and historical base rates of leaderboard turnover. However, no expert views an OpenAI win as guaranteed; a Google hold or even a tie remain substantial possibilities.",
