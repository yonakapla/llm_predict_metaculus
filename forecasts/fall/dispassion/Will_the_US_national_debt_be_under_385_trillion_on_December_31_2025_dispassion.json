From a Government Finance (OMB standards) perspective, the reliance on official Treasury data and the precise use of historical base rates aligns with best practices for fiscal forecasting. Additionally, the emphasis on the lack of a binding debt ceiling and the structural inertia of U.S. fiscal policy further strengthens the argument. The only potential weakness is the assignment of a 99% probability instead of 100%; however, the rationale for not going to an absolute certainty (to allow for extremely low-probability technical or administrative anomalies) is methodologically sound and displays appropriate humility in probabilistic forecasting.

From a CBO baseline perspective, the emphasis on the lack of credible policy signals for a reversal\u2014paired with a recognition of the structural drivers (entitlements, interest, gridlock)\u2014provides a robust, multi-angle justification.

The forecaster correctly notes that even extraordinary claims of deficit reduction are minor relative to the debt's ongoing growth, and that only a total and sustained shutdown could have a meaningful effect (which, even if it occurred, would likely be temporary and eventually resolved with catch-up borrowing).

The analysis rightly notes that even in prior debt ceiling standoffs, the only real pauses in debt growth have come from technical constraints, not from actual reductions or freezes in borrowing. This aligns with Keynesian insights about the resilience of structural deficits and the overwhelming momentum of fiscal policy once major commitments are in place.

The forecast could be strengthened by explicitly addressing why even a protracted shutdown would be unlikely to significantly constrain borrowing: much of the debt growth is driven by mandatory spending and interest, which continue regardless of appropriations lapses, and shutdowns are historically resolved before any major fiscal contraction occurs. Adding these institutional and incentive-based considerations would deepen the explanation for why the base rate of debt reduction is essentially zero, and why the likelihood of remaining under the $38.5T threshold is so vanishingly small."

The explicit mention of the only real uncertainties\u2014technical adjustments or radical last-minute deals\u2014demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of both the mechanics and politics of US fiscal policy. This complements my own perspective by framing the near-certainty of surpassing the threshold as a product of deep institutional inertia and path dependency, not just contemporary gridlock.

Additionally, the forecast could contextualize why appropriations disruptions (like shutdowns) have historically led to eventual catch-up spending and back-pay, so they rarely produce actual fiscal contraction. Bringing in these elements would reinforce why the probability of staying under $38.5T is not just high because of current trends, but because of the deep-seated design of the US policy process itself\u2014a crucial insight from political science that complements the fiscal mechanics perspective."

The reasoning is closely aligned with historical Treasury data and OMB standards of fiscal analysis.

This milestone was achieved just 71 days after the debt crossed $37 trillion in August 2025, marking an accelerating pace of borrowing. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had projected the debt would not reach $37 trillion until 2030, but this timeline was overtaken by over five years. The debt grew from $35 trillion in November 2024 to $36 trillion in 188 days, then to $37 trillion in 265 days, but the borrowing accelerated after the debt ceiling was raised by $5 trillion on July 1, 2025, when the debt stood at $36.2 trillion. In less than two months, the government borrowed over $800 billion, pushing the debt past $37 trillion. The article attributes the rapid growth to unsustainable federal spending, which exceeded $7 trillion in fiscal 2025\u2014a 4.1% increase from the prior year\u2014despite a 6.4% rise in federal revenue. Tariff revenue, which increased by 142% in fiscal 2025, was insufficient to close the deficit, which ranked as the fourth-largest in U.S. history. The national debt now stands at 120.6% of GDP, exceeding the 90% threshold shown to reduce economic growth by about 30%. Interest payments on the debt reached $1.2 trillion in fiscal 2024, surpassing spending on national defense ($917 billion) and Medicare ($997 billion), and second only to Social Security ($1.58 trillion). The article warns that growing fiscal irresponsibility may erode confidence in U.S. creditworthiness, potentially undermining the dollar. To manage borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve has delayed balance sheet reduction and may soon return to quantitative easing (QE), which could fuel further inflation. The article concludes that while no crisis has yet occurred despite decades of warnings, the debt\u2019s accumulation is a long-term threat that could lead to sudden consequences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 03:46 PM\nSource:[TalkMarkets - Economics & Politics](https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-the-national-debt-exceeds-38-trillion?post=530425)\n\n**U.S. Debt Surpasses $38 Trillion: A New Era of Financial Uncertainty**\nThe United States surpassed the $38 trillion mark in national debt for the first time in its history, according to a daily report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury dated October 22, 2025.

This record level reflects deep economic challenges driven by sustained government spending and rising interest costs, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of federal budgeting and fiscal policy under President Donald Trump's administration. The debt has risen from $37 trillion in August 2025 to $38 trillion in less than two months\u2014a pace faster than any period outside the COVID-19 pandemic. The Treasury publishes these figures daily, making them a key reference for the nation\u2019s fiscal health. Despite these alarming figures, the Trump administration claims its fiscal policies are slowing spending and reducing the massive budget deficit. According to a recent Treasury analysis, the cumulative deficit from April to September 2025 reached $468 billion\u2014presented by the administration as a sign of relative improvement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated on X (formerly Twitter) that this marks the lowest deficit level since 2019, emphasizing efforts to balance economic growth with debt reduction. White House spokesperson Kosh Desai reported that Trump has reduced the deficit by $350 billion compared to the same period in 2024, attributing this to spending cuts and increased revenues from taxes and tariffs. The administration also pledged to boost economic growth, reduce inflation, lower borrowing costs, and combat waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending. While the administration celebrates a temporary decline in deficit rates, the rising federal debt remains a persistent threat to long-term economic stability, as the U.S. enters a critical phase requiring fiscal discipline and smart policy to avoid a new financial crisis.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 08:34 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6741869)\n\n**U.S. National Debt Tops $38 Trillion For First Time Amid Mounting Fiscal Warnings - Worthy Christian News**\nThe U.S. national debt surpassed $38 trillion for the first time on October 21, 2025, according to Treasury Department data, marking a rise from $37 trillion just two months earlier and $36 trillion a year prior. The debt is growing at twice the average rate since 2000, with experts warning that interest payments could reach $1.8 trillion annually by 2035\u2014exceeding current defense spending. Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, stated that the U.S. has spent approximately $4 trillion on interest over the past decade, with projections rising to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, crowding out investments in public and private sectors. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, described the milestone as a 'wake-up call,' emphasizing that the nation is becoming 'distressingly numb to our own dysfunction,' citing a government shutdown, failure to pass budgets, and lack of action on Social Security and Medicare trust fund depletion\u2014projected to occur in seven years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts a $2.6 trillion annual deficit by 2035, adding $22.7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Public debt is expected to rise from 100% of GDP in 2025 to 120% by 2035, a level not seen outside wartime. Federal spending is projected to total $88 trillion over the next decade\u201423.6% of GDP\u2014while tax revenue remains near 17.5% of GDP. The Committee attributed the rapid increase to 'delayed borrowing' during the debt ceiling standoff, forcing the Treasury to use 'extraordinary measures' to avoid default. With another debt ceiling debate imminent and no bipartisan agreement on spending reform, experts warn the U.S. is on a perilous fiscal path. MacGuineas concluded, 'Policymakers have a choice: continue to abdicate the most basic responsibilities of budgeting\u2014or finally confront the worsening fiscal situation before it\u2019s too late.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 03:09 PM\nSource:[worthynews.com](https://www.worthynews.com/109619-u-s-national-debt-tops-38-trillion-for-first-time-amid-mounting-fiscal-warnings)\n\n**In The Blink Of An Eye The National Debt Exceeds $38 Trillion**\nThe U.S. national debt surpassed $38 trillion on October 21, 2025, reaching $38,019,813,354,700.26, according to the article.

The report highlighted persistently high fiscal deficits, rising interest expenses, and constrained budget flexibility as key drivers of increasing government debt, with projections indicating the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 140% by 2030\u2014well above levels seen in most sovereign nations. The agency also cited growing centralization of executive power, repeated defiance of court rulings under the Trump administration, and weakened congressional oversight, which have reduced policy predictability and stability, exemplified by unpredictable trade negotiations. The rating outlook remains 'stable,' with balanced risks of upgrade or downgrade over the next 12 to 18 months. Downside risks include continued debt growth and a potential decline in global demand for U.S. Treasuries if the dollar\u2019s reserve currency status weakens. On October 21, 2025, U.S. federal debt surpassed $38 trillion\u2014just two months after crossing $37 trillion in mid-August. The government shutdown, which entered its 24th day on October 24, 2025, has already broken the record for the second-longest shutdown in history, with a temporary funding bill repeatedly blocked in Congress. Earlier in the year, Fitch downgraded the U.S. outlook to 'negative' on July 21, 2025, citing rising policy uncertainty, slowing growth, and persistently high interest rates. Fitch projected that tax and spending legislation would keep the deficit above 7% of GDP and push debt-to-GDP to 135% by 2029. Moody\u2019s had previously downgraded the U.S. sovereign rating from AAA to AA1 on May 16, 2025, citing elevated debt and interest burdens relative to peers and a deteriorating fiscal trajectory. The agency also noted that new trade tariffs under the incoming administration have significantly harmed the U.S. economy. All three major credit rating agencies\u2014Moody\u2019s, Fitch, and Scope\u2014have now downgraded U.S. sovereign credit, signaling mounting concerns over long-term fiscal sustainability.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 03:16 PM\nSource:[\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u7f51_\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u65d7\u4e0b\u8d44\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0_\u80a1\u7968_\u57fa\u91d1_\u671f\u8d27_\u503a\u5238_\u7406\u8d22_\u8d22\u7ecf_\u884c\u60c5_\u6570\u636e_\u80a1\u5427_\u535a\u5ba2_\u8bba\u575b](http://stcn.com/article/detail/3411803.html)\n\n**U.S. National Debt Hits $38 Trillion \u2013 Every American Now Carries $110,649 in Debt**\nThe United States national debt reached a record high of $38 trillion in early October 2025, with real-time data showing it at $38,026,645,975,100 at the time of publication. This marks the fastest increase in debt since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the debt rising from $36 trillion in November 2024 to $37 trillion by August 2025, and then surpassing $38 trillion just two months later. The debt growth exceeds projections made by the Congressional Budget Office before the pandemic and is now 120.7% of GDP\u2014up from 55.7% in 2000 and 34.7% in 1980. On a per capita basis, this translates to $110,649 in national debt per American citizen, or $327,507 per taxpayer. Experts warn that rising debt may lead to higher inflation, reduced consumer purchasing power, and increased borrowing costs for homes and cars. Kent Smetters, professor at the Wharton School, stated that future generations may face diminished economic prospects due to accumulated inflation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) confirms that higher debt raises consumer borrowing costs. Michael Peterson of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation emphasized that reaching $38 trillion during a government shutdown signals legislative failure to fulfill fiscal responsibilities. He projected that interest payments will rise from $4 trillion over the past decade to $14 trillion in the next decade, potentially crowding out public and private investments. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported a $46.8 billion reduction in the deficit from April to September 2025\u2014the lowest since 2019\u2014due to spending cuts. However, the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) is expected to add trillions to the national debt, suggesting further increases in the coming years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 07:31 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/48420451/38-110-649)\n\n**U.S. Debt Surpasses $38 Trillion: A New Era of Financial Uncertainty**\nThe United States surpassed the $38 trillion mark in national debt for the first time in its history, according to a daily report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury dated October 22, 2025.

The primary concern is the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to rise to 156% by 2055, reflecting spending that far exceeds economic growth. Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget described the milestone as 'appalling,' criticizing Washington for ignoring the fiscal crisis. Michael Peterson of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation warned that 'budgeting-by-crisis' is unsustainable. President Trump proposed unconventional solutions, such as selling 'Gold Cards' to wealthy immigrants, which economists labeled 'peculiar' but acknowledged as a step in the right direction. While the $38 trillion figure itself is not inherently problematic\u2014government debt underpins the global bond market\u2014the growing cost of servicing it is alarming. As of September 2025, the U.S. spent $1.21 trillion on interest payments, accounting for 17% of total federal spending in fiscal year 2025. The average interest rate on U.S. debt has more than doubled since 2021, rising from 1.61% to 3.36%. Prominent figures including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Bridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio, and Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin have raised alarms, and bipartisan policy advisors are intensifying warnings on Capitol Hill about the long-term sustainability of U.S. fiscal policy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 08:33 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

This marks the fastest accumulation of a trillion dollars in debt outside the emergency spending period of the Covid-19 pandemic. The debt, which represents the total amount the US government has borrowed and not repaid, is the sum of past budget deficits and accumulated interest. Despite claims by the Trump administration that it reduced the deficit by $350 billion compared to the same period last year and that tariffs would lower the deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, new Treasury Department data shows a $468 billion cumulative deficit from April to September 2025\u2014the lowest since 2019. However, the Congressional Budget Office projects that President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' will add $4.1 trillion to the deficit. Experts warn of serious economic consequences: Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, stated the US is spending $7 trillion annually while earning $5 trillion, leading to a 40% spending gap and reduced global demand for US debt. Michael Peterson of the Peter G.

National Debt Surges As Democrats Hold Country Hostage For Even More Spending - Geller Report**\nThe U.S. national debt surpassed $38 trillion for the first time on October 21, 2025, reaching $38,019,813,354,700.26, according to data from the Treasury Department. This milestone follows the $37 trillion threshold reached in mid-August 2025 and the $36 trillion mark breached in December 2024. The rapid growth is attributed to sustained high budget deficits\u2014$1.8 trillion in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025\u2014and rising interest expenses, which are projected to increase from $1 trillion in 2025 to $1.8 trillion by 2035. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts that national debt held by the public will rise from 100% of GDP in 2025 to 120% by 2035, with annual deficits reaching $2.6 trillion by 2035 and total deficits over the next decade adding $22.7 trillion to the debt. Federal spending is projected at $88 trillion (23.6% of GDP) over the next decade, while tax revenue is expected to be $65 trillion (17.5% of GDP), both deviating from historical averages. Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, warned the debt is 'unsustainable' and urged entitlement reform. Michael A. Peterson of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation criticized lawmakers for failing fiscal duties, noting the debt is growing at twice the rate since 2000. The article, published by Geller Report, blames Democrats for maintaining 'bloated budgets' through continuing resolutions and accuses them of holding the country hostage for more spending, while Republicans are criticized for lacking Senate votes to end them. The article also claims tech platforms like Google Adsense, Facebook, and Twitter have banned or shadow-banned the outlet.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[gellerreport.com](https://gellerreport.com/2025/10/38-trillion-national-debt-surges-as-democrats-hold-country-hostage-for-even-more-spending.html/)\n\n**Unprecedented: U.S. National Debt Surpasses $38 Trillion Amid Government Shutdown**\nThe total U.S. national debt surpassed $38 trillion on Wednesday, marking an unprecedented record and highlighting the accelerating pace of federal debt accumulation. This milestone was reached just two months after the debt crossed $37 trillion in August 2024, making it the fastest increase in debt outside the COVID-19 pandemic era. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the new figure was recorded in daily financial accounts, reflecting ongoing fiscal pressures due to rising expenditures and sluggish revenues. Experts warn that sustained debt growth threatens U.S. economic stability. Kent Smiters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, formerly of the Treasury under President George W. Bush, stated that rising public debt eventually leads to higher inflation, eroding purchasing power and making homeownership harder for future generations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes that rising federal debt negatively affects citizens through higher borrowing costs for mortgages and auto loans, declining wages due to reduced corporate investment, and increased prices for goods and services. Meanwhile, the Trump administration claimed its economic policies slowed spending and reduced the fiscal deficit, citing a $468 billion cumulative deficit from April to September\u2014its lowest level since 2019. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed on X (formerly Twitter) that President Trump reduced the deficit by $350 billion in the first eight months of his term compared to the same period in 2024, through spending cuts and increased revenues. White House spokesperson Kosh Desai said the administration continues to pursue strong economic growth, inflation reduction, higher customs revenues, lower borrowing costs, and efforts to combat waste, fraud, and financial mismanagement. The Congressional Budget Office reports that the national debt rose by $69,713.82 per second over the past year\u2014unprecedented speed. Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter J. Peterson Foundation, called the $38 trillion milestone during a government shutdown a 'disturbing signal' that lawmakers are failing their fiscal responsibilities, warning that without decisive action to control spending and balance revenues and expenditures, future generations will face greater economic hardship. The situation unfolds amid deep political divisions in Washington, with analysts cautioning that such high debt levels may limit the U.S.'s ability to respond to future crises and pressure domestic and global bond markets and interest rates.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 07:44 AM\nSource:[waradana.com](https://waradana.com/article/242034-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B7%D9%85-%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**U.S. National Debt Tops $38 Trillion For First Time Amid Mounting Fiscal Warnings - Worthy Christian News**\nThe U.S. national debt surpassed $38 trillion for the first time on October 21, 2025, according to Treasury Department data, marking a rise from $37 trillion just two months earlier and $36 trillion a year prior. The debt is growing at twice the average rate since 2000, with experts warning that interest payments could reach $1.8 trillion annually by 2035\u2014exceeding current defense spending. Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, stated that the U.S. has spent approximately $4 trillion on interest over the past decade, with projections rising to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, crowding out investments in public and private sectors. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, described the milestone as a 'wake-up call,' emphasizing that the nation is becoming 'distressingly numb to our own dysfunction,' citing a government shutdown, failure to pass budgets, and lack of action on Social Security and Medicare trust fund depletion\u2014projected to occur in seven years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts a $2.6 trillion annual deficit by 2035, adding $22.7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Public debt is expected to rise from 100% of GDP in 2025 to 120% by 2035, a level not seen outside wartime. Federal spending is projected to total $88 trillion over the next decade\u201423.6% of GDP\u2014while tax revenue remains near 17.5% of GDP. The Committee attributed the rapid increase to 'delayed borrowing' during the debt ceiling standoff, forcing the Treasury to use 'extraordinary measures' to avoid default. With another debt ceiling debate imminent and no bipartisan agreement on spending reform, experts warn the U.S. is on a perilous fiscal path. MacGuineas concluded, 'Policymakers have a choice: continue to abdicate the most basic responsibilities of budgeting\u2014or finally confront the worsening fiscal situation before it\u2019s too late.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 03:09 PM\nSource:[worthynews.com](https://www.worthynews.com/109619-u-s-national-debt-tops-38-trillion-for-first-time-amid-mounting-fiscal-warnings)\n\n**America\u2019s debt load soars past $38 trillion in record climb**\nThe U.S. government's gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion, according to the latest Treasury Department data, marking a record climb and nearing the combined economic output of China, India, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The debt increased by $1 trillion since August 2024, one of the fastest rates of accumulation in U.S. history outside the COVID-19 pandemic years. For the 2025 fiscal year, with a GDP of $30.12 trillion, the debt-to-GDP ratio reached approximately 125%, raising concerns about the government\u2019s ability to repay its obligations. Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model and former Treasury official, warned that rising debt could lead to higher inflation and erode household purchasing power. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that increasing debt raises borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards, while also reducing business access to capital, potentially lowering wages and job opportunities. Debt held by the public rose 131% since 2015, and intra-governmental holdings increased by 46% over the same period. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported a $1.8 trillion deficit for fiscal year 2025, despite a $300 billion rise in tax revenues, as spending increased by a similar amount. Republican lawmakers and some centrist Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s administration for allowing debt to rise, though the administration claims progress: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cited a $350 billion deficit reduction compared to the same period in 2024 and projected tariff revenue of $300 billion. The White House stated its commitment to economic growth, lower inflation, tariff revenue, reduced borrowing costs, and cuts to waste, fraud, and abuse.

Peterson Foundation. Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog, stated this milestone reflects lawmakers failing their fiscal duties, noting the debt is growing at twice the rate since 2000. Interest payments on the debt now reach approximately $1 trillion annually\u2014the fastest-growing federal budget category\u2014and are projected to total $14 trillion over the next decade, crowding out public and private investments. The ongoing partial government shutdown, now in its third week, has exacerbated fiscal strain, adding short-term costs and delaying economic activity and budget reforms. Treasury reports, including the 2024 Bureau of Fiscal Service Financial Report, have warned of an 'unsustainable fiscal path' and that deficit reduction has lagged behind post-crisis recovery efforts, such as those after the Great Recession. A Yale Budget Lab report indicates rising debt pressures inflation and interest rates, increasing borrowing costs for households and businesses. EY analysis suggests sustained job and income losses could result from the debt trajectory. While President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff regime generated $350 billion annually in revenue, analysts note it is not enough to offset long-term fiscal risks. The Congressional Budget Office estimated tariffs could reduce deficits by $4 billion over ten years, and S&P Global reaffirmed the U.S. credit rating citing 'broad revenue buoyancy,' though all three major ratings agencies have downgraded the U.S. due to fiscal unsustainability and political gridlock. These downgrades have increased borrowing costs and raised concerns about the long-term status of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. Gold prices surged above $4,000 per ounce in 2025, reflecting market anxiety. Peterson concluded, 'Adding trillion after trillion to the debt and budgeting-by-crisis is no way for a great nation like America to run its finances,' urging lawmakers to adopt responsible fiscal reforms.

Key drivers include rising entitlement spending (Social Security, Medicare), declining corporate tax revenues, and political gridlock preventing long-term fiscal reforms. Experts warn the U.S. is 'going broke slowly,' with debt growing faster than economic output, and stress that tariffs alone cannot resolve the crisis. Sustainable fiscal reform\u2014addressing spending growth, entitlement programs, and tax policy\u2014is essential to ensure long-term economic stability.

The shutdown began due to a failure by the Republican and Democratic parties to agree on new spending legislation, leaving the federal government without approved funding. The economic impact is significant: estimated losses reach $15 billion per week in GDP, with 750,000 federal employees placed on unpaid leave, while essential personnel\u2014including military and transportation security staff\u2014continue working without pay. The federal debt has reached $37 trillion, with rising interest payments and growing costs for mandatory programs like Social Security. Despite a 273% year-on-year increase in tariff revenues (reaching $21 billion in July 2025), the budget deficit surged 20% in July compared to the same month in 2024, underscoring a widening gap between revenue and expenditure. The U.S. Treasury continues borrowing to finance the shortfall. The situation has heightened global concerns about the stability of the U.S. economy and the dollar\u2019s value. As a result, investors are flocking to safe-haven assets: gold prices have surged 51% year-to-date, reaching record highs, while the dollar has declined by about 10% since January 2025, on track for its worst annual performance in 22 years. Market uncertainty is compounded by delayed economic data\u2014such as jobs and inflation reports\u2014from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics due to the shutdown, affecting Federal Reserve decision-making. Moody\u2019s warned that successive administrations and Congress have repeatedly failed to address the unsustainable fiscal trajectory, with current spending proposals unlikely to deliver meaningful long-term reductions in mandatory spending or the deficit.

According to the US Treasury Department, this surge is attributed to the passage of the 'Great Big Law' which raised the debt ceiling from $36.1 trillion to $41.1 trillion, resulting in a daily increase of $22 billion. The US has seen a massive influx of spending, exacerbating the financial crisis affecting the world's largest economy. Last week alone, the US Treasury sold $724 billion in bonds in 10 auctions, reflecting the deepening US debt crisis that is increasingly affecting global financial stability. The data shows that the US public debt has reached 126.79% of the country's GDP in 2024, which stood at $29.18 trillion. The International Monetary Fund warned in April 2024 that the US public debt, combined with rising interest rates, poses a threat to global interest rates and puts pressure on financial markets. Ray Dalio, a renowned investor, pointed out in July 2025 that the debt could reach 130% of GDP within a decade, with alarming financial implications for every American family, potentially reaching $425,000 in debt.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts unanimously agree that it is almost certain the US national debt will exceed $38.5 trillion by December 31, 2025. Their reasoning is based on several converging lines of analysis: \n- The debt already stands above $38 trillion as of October 21\u201322, 2025, and is rising at an unprecedented pace of about $25 billion per day, or $400\u2013425 billion per month. This alone ensures that the $38.5 trillion threshold would be breached well before year-end, likely in November. \n- Recent political developments, including the July 2025 debt ceiling increase, have removed any imminent legal constraint on further borrowing, enabling a surge in Treasury issuance. \n- Political gridlock, lack of bipartisan fiscal restraint, structural budget deficits, and large entitlement and interest costs all contribute to ongoing and likely accelerating debt growth. \n- Even factors that could slow the pace\u2014such as the ongoing government shutdown, increased tariff revenues, or minor deficit-reduction claims\u2014are dwarfed by the scale of current and projected deficits, and shutdowns historically do not stem debt increases in any meaningful way.\n- There is no evidence in current news, budget negotiations, or historical precedent for a scenario in which nominal US debt declines or even plateaus for two months absent an artificial constraint like a binding debt ceiling or technical accounting trick\u2014events that experts judge as exceedingly unlikely.\nBase-rate and historical pattern arguments were highlighted by all experts: after surpassing a round trillion-dollar mark, nominal US federal debt virtually never decreases, and the inertia of fiscal institutions makes near-term reversals extremely improbable. Experts cite the extraordinarily high base rate for debt to continue rising in the absence of extreme, unprecedented measures. \nAssigned probabilities ranged from 99% to 1% (Yes to debt under $38.5T), with some experts giving a literal 0% (absolute certainty of exceeding $38.5T), and even the most 'optimistic' estimates for lower debt were conditional on implausible, crisis-driven events such as a full and sustained government shutdown blocking all borrowing. In summary: the expert consensus is that a 'No' outcome (debt under $38.5T) is extraordinarily unlikely, and a 'Yes' outcome (debt over $38.5T) follows naturally from the current trajectory and base rates, absent a wholly unprecedented shock.",
