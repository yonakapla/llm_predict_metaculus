While last-minute deals are common, the current standoff is unusually entrenched, with both sides publicly unwilling to move and the President refusing to engage in negotiation. The House CR cannot pass the Senate without Democratic support, and Democrats are holding firm on their policy asks, which are unacceptable to Republicans.

The institutional constraints (Senate 60-vote threshold, short calendar) make a last-minute deal logistically difficult. While reputational risk remains a brake on prolonged shutdowns, the incentives for at least a brief closure are stronger than in most recent cycles. The news sources are nearly unanimous in describing a lack of 'off-ramp' and genuine deadlock, with both sides publicly preparing for a shutdown and the White House issuing OMB memos for agency layoffs.

The probability (85%) is well supported by both historical base rates for shutdowns in similar deadlocks and the present lack of an off-ramp.

Rational Choice Institutionalism reminds us that, as the costs of blame and disruption escalate, incentives can shift rapidly, especially given the historical record of shutdowns being averted or resolved within hours or days. The forecast would be stronger if it more clearly addressed the mechanisms by which both parties might rationalize a short-term retreat, such as procedural fig leaves or ambiguous policy language, thus slightly lowering the probability to reflect persistent status quo inertia."

By assigning a 75% probability, the forecast captures the elevated\u2014but not absolute\u2014shutdown risk, balancing the historical prevalence of near-misses with the unique dynamics of this standoff.

From an incrementalist perspective, I appreciate that the forecast does not disregard the small but real possibility of a last-second deal, maintaining appropriate humility in the face of uncertainty. However, it rightly prioritizes the risk of a shutdown as the default, given the absence of meaningful negotiation, the hardening of public rhetoric (including explicit OMB threats and canceled meetings), and the logistical barriers to swift legislative action. The 87% probability is aggressive, but justified: it aligns with both the institutional constraints and the current political context, while still leaving a sliver of probability for the status quo bias to reassert itself at the last possible moment."

While the current lack of negotiation and compressed timeline are major obstacles, the probability (88%) might slightly overstate the case by underweighting these federalism-driven feedback channels, which occasionally enable a technical short-term fix.

Here's why.**\nThe U.S. federal government is on track to shut down next week because Republicans and Democrats have failed to agree on a funding plan before the current appropriations expire on September\u00a030,\u00a02025. Republicans control the House, Senate and presidency, but in the Senate most major bills require 60 votes to overcome the filibuster; with only 53 Republican senators, they need Democratic support to pass a funding bill. Both parties want a short\u2011term \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d to buy time for a full budget, yet they remain at an impasse. Democrats, under pressure from their base, are using the stalemate to extract concessions, while Republicans\u2014including President Donald Trump\u2014have refused to negotiate. Trump cancelled a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and said, 'If it has to shut down, it'll have to shut down,' blaming Democrats for the potential shutdown.\n\nTwo competing proposals are circulating. The Republican bill would keep funding at current levels through November\u00a021 and add security money for lawmakers after the killing of Charlie Kirk. The Democratic bill would fund the government through October\u00a031 and includes provisions Republicans are unlikely to accept, such as reversing Medicaid cuts from the \u2018Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 and permanently extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act. If those cuts and subsidy reversals go through, millions of Americans could lose health coverage.\n\nThe GOP bill passed the House largely along party lines but stalled in the Senate, failing to reach the 60\u2011vote threshold. The Democratic bill only received a Senate vote and also failed.\n\nIf a shutdown occurs, mandatory\u2011spending programs (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid) will continue, but most federal employees will not be paid until the shutdown ends, and some may be furloughed. The Trump administration has warned of potential mass firings, while some Democrats dismiss the threat as intimidation. National parks, museums, and air\u2011traffic control could be shut down or delayed, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a five\u2011week shutdown in 2019 reduced real GDP by $3\u202fbillion.\n\nThe article presents the facts and potential consequences without overt editorializing, citing the current political dynamics and the specific funding proposals on the table.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 08:09 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-government-shutting-down-explainer-2025-9)\n\n**White House Prepares Cuts and Layoffs Ahead of Possible Federal Government Shutdown**\nOn Thursday 25 September, the U.S. Congress faced a standoff as President Donald Trump warned that the federal government would shut down on Tuesday 30 September if Congress fails to approve a new spending bill. The House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, introduced a provisional bill to extend federal funding until 21 November, but the Senate, dominated by Democrats, has refused to approve it unless both parties negotiate an extension for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that are about to expire.

A memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2013 obtained by Pol\u00edtico before its official release \u2013 instructs agencies to identify programs that will be unfunded on 1 October and have no alternative funding; positions not aligned with President Trump\u2019s priorities will be permanently eliminated, a practice referred to as 'RIF' (Reduction in Force). The OMB official also listed programs that will continue after a shutdown: Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, military operations, law enforcement, ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and air traffic control. According to NBC News, the Senate requires 60 votes to pass a funding measure; Republicans currently hold 53 votes and need seven Democratic votes to reach the threshold. The last shutdown confrontation in March ended when Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer conceded, allowing a spending bill to pass.

Here's why.**\nThe U.S. federal government is on track to shut down next week because Republicans and Democrats have failed to agree on a funding plan before the current appropriations expire on September\u00a030,\u00a02025. Republicans control the House, Senate and presidency, but in the Senate most major bills require 60 votes to overcome the filibuster; with only 53 Republican senators, they need Democratic support to pass a funding bill. Both parties want a short\u2011term \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d to buy time for a full budget, yet they remain at an impasse. Democrats, under pressure from their base, are using the stalemate to extract concessions, while Republicans\u2014including President Donald Trump\u2014have refused to negotiate. Trump cancelled a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and said, 'If it has to shut down, it'll have to shut down,' blaming Democrats for the potential shutdown.\n\nTwo competing proposals are circulating. The Republican bill would keep funding at current levels through November\u00a021 and add security money for lawmakers after the killing of Charlie Kirk. The Democratic bill would fund the government through October\u00a031 and includes provisions Republicans are unlikely to accept, such as reversing Medicaid cuts from the \u2018Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 and permanently extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act. If those cuts and subsidy reversals go through, millions of Americans could lose health coverage.\n\nThe GOP bill passed the House largely along party lines but stalled in the Senate, failing to reach the 60\u2011vote threshold. The Democratic bill only received a Senate vote and also failed.\n\nIf a shutdown occurs, mandatory\u2011spending programs (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid) will continue, but most federal employees will not be paid until the shutdown ends, and some may be furloughed. The Trump administration has warned of potential mass firings, while some Democrats dismiss the threat as intimidation. National parks, museums, and air\u2011traffic control could be shut down or delayed, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a five\u2011week shutdown in 2019 reduced real GDP by $3\u202fbillion.\n\nThe article presents the facts and potential consequences without overt editorializing, citing the current political dynamics and the specific funding proposals on the table.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 08:09 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-government-shutting-down-explainer-2025-9)\n\n**Financial Markets May Face Another Blow: White House Drafts \u2018Government Shutdown Plan\u2019 Amid Looming Mass Layoffs**\nOn September\u202f26,\u202f2025, Hexun Stock Channel reported that the White House, under President Donald Trump, has directed federal agencies to prepare for a potential government shutdown on October\u202f1. The directive includes developing RIF (reduction\u2011in\u2011force) plans that would permanently lay off employees if funding expires and no alternative source is found. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has also instructed agencies to issue RIF notices for projects that do not align with the president\u2019s core priorities. The article cites an internal memo stating, 'RIF\u901a\u77e5\u5c06\u662f\u5bf9\u56e0\u653f\u5e9c\u62e8\u6b3e\u4e2d\u65ad\u800c\u53d1\u51fa\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65e0\u85aa\u4f11\u5047\u901a\u77e5\u7684\u8865\u5145,' and that agencies should adjust RIFs after FY\u202f2026 to maintain minimum staffing for statutory functions. The shutdown risk is described as '\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b' and hinges on Congress passing a clean continuing resolution before the September\u202f30 funding deadline. The House, controlled by Republicans, passed a temporary funding bill extending operations to November\u202f21, while the Senate requires at least seven Democrats to approve a similar measure. Senator Chuck Schumer called the OMB directive a '\u6050\u5413\u4f01\u56fe' and warned that the layoffs could be overturned in court or reversed once the shutdown ends. The article notes that the shutdown would trigger mass furloughs, potentially driving U.S. equities lower, increasing volatility in gold and short\u2011term rates, and causing a sustained pullback in global stock markets.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 07:33 PM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u80a1\u7968\u9891\u9053](http://stock.hexun.com/2025-09-26/221589957.html)\n\n**White House Prepares Cuts and Layoffs Ahead of Possible Federal Government Shutdown**\nOn Thursday 25 September, the U.S. Congress faced a standoff as President Donald Trump warned that the federal government would shut down on Tuesday 30 September if Congress fails to approve a new spending bill. The House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, introduced a provisional bill to extend federal funding until 21 November, but the Senate, dominated by Democrats, has refused to approve it unless both parties negotiate an extension for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that are about to expire. If the impasse is not resolved, the federal government will lack money to pay salaries for non\u2011essential employees.

According to the OMB, the cuts will target programs that are not funded by mandatory appropriations and are deemed 'inconsistent with the President\u2019s priorities'. The document cited by Politico and the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes indicates that programs funded by mandatory appropriations\u2014such as Social Security, Medicare, veterans\u2019 benefits, military operations, law\u2011enforcement and air\u2011traffic control\u2014would be exempt. The OMB warns that the reductions would become permanent, creating a lasting structural impact on public employment. Politically, the move is viewed as a bargaining tool: Republicans control both chambers but need at least seven Democratic votes in the Senate to pass a spending plan. The current Republican proposal provides a temporary funding extension until the end of November, while Democrats are demanding the restoration of hundreds of billions of dollars in health\u2011care spending. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the tactic as 'an intimidation attempt', saying Trump is \"not trying to govern, but to instill fear\". If Congress fails to reach an agreement by the deadline, the consequences could be significant: hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed or laid off, essential services would be suspended, and market confidence could suffer.

Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck\u202fSchumer, have rejected a seven\u2011week temporary funding patch that Republicans had pushed earlier in the year, arguing that it would give the GOP a bargaining chip.

The standoff centers on healthcare and Medicaid cuts. The House approved a Republican short\u2011term measure to keep the government funded into November, but the bill failed in the Senate, where a 60\u2011vote threshold is required for passage.

They wrote, 'At your direction, Republican congressional leaders have repeatedly and publicly refused to engage in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government open.' Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman was the only Democrat to vote for the Republican bill in the House, highlighting intraparty divisions. Trump warned that a government closure could occur, though essential payments such as Social Security and military pay would continue. Schumer and Jeffries countered, 'With the September 30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats.' Negotiations are expected to intensify as both parties weigh the political and economic costs of a potential shutdown, with healthcare funding remaining at the center of the debate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 03:08 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-government-faces-september-30-shutdown-deadline-democrats-push-healthcare-protections-amid-funding-standoff-11758552748146.html)\n\n**'My brain's falling out of my head': GOP stunned by 'weird' Dem maneuver in budget fight**\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D\u2011NY) spoke at a press conference on June\u202f10\u202f2025, as the deadline to pass a spending bill before the start of fiscal year\u202f2026 (Oct\u202f1) approaches. The article reports that if Congress fails to adopt a bill by that date, the federal government would shut down. Traditionally, a standoff leads Democrats to push for a continuing resolution (CR) to keep funding at current levels. In this case, Republicans are pushing for a CR while Democrats demand budget concessions, a reversal that surprised GOP lawmakers. Rep. Rich McCormick (R\u2011GA) said, 'My brain's falling out of my head,' after learning that the Freedom Caucus is supporting a CR while Democrats threaten a shutdown. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D\u2011MD) said, 'Everything they're doing is designed to protect their dismantling of Medicaid and the health care system, and we made a very emphatic statement that we are going to stand strong.' A House Republican, speaking anonymously, described the situation as 'the Twilight Zone.' President Donald Trump has criticized Democrats for refusing a CR, accusing them of wanting to 'shut down the country,' but critics note he still needs Democratic votes to avoid a shutdown. Sen. Mark Warner (D\u2011VA) said, 'I know the president may not want to acknowledge checks and balances, [but] he can't do this with Republican\u2011only votes.' The article also notes that the Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire this year, a point that has divided the GOP and could become a political liability in the upcoming midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:50 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/government-2674015847/)\n\n**Tables turn for Democrats as they use shutdown for leverage**\nThe U.S. Congress is approaching a potential government shutdown on Oct.\u202f1, 2025, with the parties\u2019 roles reversed from past crises. Republicans are pushing a \"clean\" seven\u2011week continuing resolution (CR) to buy time for negotiations, while Democrats have drafted a four\u2011week shutdown plan that adds demands such as a permanent extension of health\u2011insurance subsidies.  Rep. Rich McCormick (R\u2011Ga.) remarked, 'My brain's falling out of my head,' to describe the oddness of the current standoff.  House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R\u2011Okla.) recalled the 2013 shutdown, noting, 'They tied something unrelated to spending, Obamacare, and shut down the government,' and said it was a mistake.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer countered, 'What's different? They were taking something away. We're trying to restore something that they took away.'  Democrats argue that the GOP\u2019s strategy is a tactic to reverse health\u2011care provisions and cut Medicaid, with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D\u2011Md.) stating, 'Everything they're doing is designed to protect their dismantling of Medicaid and the health care system.'  Rep. Mike Levin (D\u2011Calif.) warned, 'There's nothing clean about the administration undermining Congress.'  Senator Mark Warner (D\u2011Va.) warned that a shutdown could leave 17\u202fmillion Americans without health insurance, saying, 'I know the president may not want to acknowledge checks and balances, but he can't do this with Republican\u2011only votes.'  Trump\u2019s comments that Republicans should not engage with Democrats have further inflamed tensions, with Rep. Bennie Thompson (D\u2011Miss.) noting, 'Donald Trump told them, 'Don't talk to the Democrats,' and so they didn't.'  The article presents the facts and statements from both sides without overt editorializing, offering a balanced view of the current budget impasse.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:45 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/tables-turn-democrats-shutdown-leverage-084500112.html)\n\n**US rolls toward a 'terrible' government shutdown, no exit ramp in sight \u2022 Tennessee Lookout**\nThe article reports a deadlock on Capitol Hill over whether to fund the federal government for a seven\u2011week temporary period or to allow a shutdown that could last longer.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who had earlier urged a short\u2011term funding patch, has now said Democrats will not support a seven\u2011week stopgap ahead of the Oct.\u202f1 shutdown deadline, arguing that Republicans cannot shut Democrats out of the process.  Republicans hold majorities in both chambers but need at least 60 votes in the Senate to pass a funding bill, forcing bipartisan cooperation.  The piece cites the last two shutdowns, noting they produced no policy wins, and quotes several lawmakers:  Schumer said, \u2018President Trump and Republican leaders would like nothing more than to pull us into the mud of a protracted government shutdown.\u2019  West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito called a shutdown a \u2018fool\u2019s errand\u2019 and said it was unfair to the American people.  Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy warned that Trump would have \u2018pretty much unfettered discretion\u2019 to decide which federal workers are exempt.  Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said \u2018Shutdowns are terrible and they should be avoided.\u2019  Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said \u2018Right now, we don\u2019t even have a negotiation.\u2019  Alabama Sen. Katie Britt described Schumer\u2019s change as political theater.  The article notes that a shutdown would furlough non\u2011exempt federal workers, who would receive back pay once the shutdown ends, and that the last two shutdowns left the status quo unchanged.  Key metrics mentioned include a seven\u2011week temporary funding patch, an Oct.\u202f1 shutdown deadline, a six\u2011month stopgap bill, and the need for 60 Senate votes to pass a funding measure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:43 AM\nSource:[tennesseelookout.com](https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/09/18/repub/us-rolls-toward-a-terrible-government-shutdown-no-exit-ramp-in-sight/)\n\n**Democratic leaders in Congress demand a meeting with Trump as government shutdown looms - The Boston Globe**\nThe article reports that two New York Democrats wrote a letter demanding a meeting with President Trump over the looming federal government shutdown. They wrote, 'We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,' and added, 'Democrats have been clear and consistent in our position,' and that they are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis. A Trump administration official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, dismissed the Democrats' demand. Congress, controlled by Republicans, failed to resolve the funding issue before lawmakers left town Friday for a break. The House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded into November, but the measure failed in the Senate, and a Democratic proposal that would have boosted health\u2011care funds also failed. The article notes that the current budget year and funding expire in less than two weeks, threatening a shutdown. Trump predicted Friday that there could be 'a closed country for a period of time' and said the government will continue to 'take care' of the military and Social Security payments in a closure. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R\u2011La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R\u2011S.D., have put forward a short\u2011term funding measure, a typical way Congress resolves such logjams, which would keep government operations running at current levels while talks continue. The House narrowly passed the temporary measure on a mostly party\u2011line vote, but the Senate requires a 60\u2011vote threshold, meaning support from both parties is needed. Democrats are working to protect health\u2011care programs; their proposal would extend enhanced health\u2011insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year and reverse Medicaid cuts included in Republicans' tax\u2011break and spending\u2011cut bill enacted earlier this year. Republicans say the Democrats' demands to reverse Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, though they acknowledge there is time to address the health\u2011insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead. The article also notes that Trump\u2019s first term saw a month\u2011long shutdown, the longest in federal history, in 2018\u20112019.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 09:31 PM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/20/nation/government-shutdown-trump-democrats/)\n\n**Schumer, Jeffries request meeting with Trump ahead of potential government shutdown**\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sent a letter to President Trump requesting a meeting to avoid a government shutdown after the September\u202f30 funding deadline.  In the letter they warned that \"With the September\u202f30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats,\" and urged the president to meet \"directly to reach an agreement to keep the government open and address the Republican healthcare crisis.\"  The Senate rejected a clean stopgap measure that would have funded the government through November\u202f21; only Senator John\u202fFetterman voted in favor, highlighting the 60\u2011vote threshold needed.  A competing Democratic measure, which would have extended Obamacare subsidies and reversed Medicaid cuts, also failed to advance.  The White House said the letter shows desperation, stating \"Dems walked away from a bipartisan negotiation on the [continuing resolution].\"  Trump criticized Democrats, saying \"The Republicans want to keep government open. But in the Senate, we have 53 Republicans total, and we need 60 votes,\" and added that Democrats \"actually dislike our country greatly.\"  Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John\u202fThune, urged Republicans not to negotiate with Democrats and warned that the Senate would return on September\u202f29 and the House on October.  If no deal is reached by September\u202f30, the federal government will shut down, closing most services and laying off employees.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 07:55 PM\nSource:[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schumer-jeffries-request-meeting-trump-ahead-potential-government-shut-rcna232628)\n\n**Government Shutdown Approaches As Senate Democrats Block GOP Spending Bill | FedSmith.com**\nAccording to the FedSmith.com article published 19 September 2025, a federal government shutdown as understood today did not exist before 1980. In 1980 Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued two legal opinions that established the rule that if appropriations lapse, the federal government must cease non\u2011essential operations, while the president may continue essential functions (article). The article notes that for more than a century, from the post\u2011Civil War era through the 1970s, funding gaps were handled without drama because employees continued to work and were paid late (article). The current budget impasse began when the House passed a GOP\u2011backed short\u2011term continuing resolution (CR) to fund agencies through 21 November, adding $88\u202fmillion in new security funding in response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie\u202fKirk (article). The Senate rejected that CR 44\u201148, falling short of the 60\u2011vote threshold (article). A competing Democratic proposal, which included expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies and restored Medicaid funding, also failed 47\u201145 (article). As a result, no spending agreement is in place and appropriations will lapse at the end of the day on 30 September 2025, potentially triggering a partial shutdown on 1 October 2025 (article). The article quotes Senate Minority Leader Chuck\u202fSchumer (D\u2011NY) saying, 'Republicans cannot expect that another take\u2011it\u2011or\u2011leave\u2011it extension of government funding that fails to address healthcare costs is going to cut it for the American people. By trying to make this partisan, Donald Trump and Republicans are shutting the government down.' (article). It also quotes Senate Majority Leader John\u202fThune (R\u2011SD) saying, 'Eventually it's going to be an up\u2011or\u2011down vote on whether or not we want to keep the government open. Democrats seem more intent in satisfying their very leftist base, who is desperately wanting to see a government shutdown.' (article). Both sides demand that a continuing resolution address healthcare concerns\u2014permanent Obamacare subsidies and reversal of Medicaid cuts for Democrats, and a 'clean' CR without policy riders for Republicans\u2014raising the odds of a shutdown (article). The article contrasts this modern political leverage with the pre\u20111980 era, describing the shutdown as a tool for drawing media attention and rallying constituencies, and noting that federal employees face furloughs, delayed pay, and disrupted services, even though essential staff such as air\u2011traffic controllers and law\u2011enforcement officers must continue working without pay until appropriations are signed (article). The article concludes that a shutdown does not streamline government but paralyzes it, creating hardship for workers and making politics more divisive (article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 10:07 PM\nSource:[FedSmith.com](https://www.fedsmith.com/2025/09/19/government-shutdown-approaches/)\n\n**US rolls toward a 'terrible' government shutdown, no exit ramp in sight**\nThe article reports a deadlock on Capitol Hill over a federal funding bill that could trigger a government shutdown.  Democrats and Republicans are at odds over whether to fund the government for seven weeks or allow a shutdown that could last longer.  The piece cites the 2013 16\u2011day shutdown over the Affordable Care Act and the 2018\u20112019 35\u2011day shutdown over a border wall to illustrate that past shutdowns yielded no policy gains.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is quoted as warning that a shutdown would be a \"gift\" for President Trump and a distraction from his agenda, and he has since shifted his stance, refusing to support a seven\u2011week stopgap that would keep the government open until the Oct.\u202f1 deadline.  The article also includes remarks from Republican senators: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito calls the shutdown a \"misery march\"; Sen. John Kennedy warns that Trump would have \"unfettered discretion\" over which federal workers could continue to work; Sen. Brian Schatz says Trump\u2019s refusal to negotiate is the root of the impasse; Sen. Chris Murphy says no progress can be made without bipartisan talks; Sen. Katie Britt frames Schumer\u2019s change as political theater; and House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro stresses there is still time for a continuing resolution.  House Speaker Mike Johnson notes that the Affordable Care Act tax\u2011credit extension is a separate issue, while the House Republican stopgap bill contains no provisions for it.  The article notes a week\u2011long recess for Rosh Hashanah, with both chambers scheduled to reconvene on Sept.\u202f29, leaving little time to negotiate before the Oct.\u202f1 shutdown deadline.  The piece concludes that a prolonged shutdown would financially strain federal employees and the public, as none of the 12 annual funding bills have passed on time.  All federal workers would be furloughed, with back\u2011pay paid after the shutdown ends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/09/us-rolls-toward-terrible-government-shutdown-no-exit-ramp-sight/408195/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of a US federal government shutdown before October 2, 2025, is substantial, with forecasts universally above 70% and most clustering in the 80\u201388% range. Common reasoning across perspectives highlights the severe partisan deadlock: Republicans lack a filibuster-proof Senate majority, both parties are entrenched in maximalist positions over policy concessions (notably on healthcare), and President Trump is refusing negotiations, even escalating with threats of permanent layoffs. Several experts emphasize that both chambers are returning from recess only at the last minute, leaving minimal time for a deal. Historical base rates of shutdowns in similar scenarios (particularly since 2010) indicate such standoffs often do result in at least brief shutdowns, even if most deadlines are barely averted. A few factors, such as blame avoidance and last-minute political pressure, marginally lower the probability but not enough to outweigh the present deadlock and procedural/logistical barriers. The consensus is that a brief shutdown (possibly only 1\u20132 days) is more likely than not, given the current lack of negotiations, institutional constraints, and incentive structures. Final estimated probabilities from experts range from 75% to 90%, with most clustering in the mid-80s, and nearly all scenarios for a 'No' outcome still rely on highly implausible last-minute compromises under severe time pressure. The collective expert assessment is that a government shutdown before October 2, 2025, is highly probable.",
