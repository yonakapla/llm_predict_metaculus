Olympic Charter provisions and the statutes of CAS and the IOC reinforce the finality of CAS decisions except for extreme procedural violations. The public and political attention, and even new evidence, do not affect the Tribunal's legal standards. Without strong, unequivocal proof of a violation of procedural rights, the status quo is likely to persist. Recent news confirms the Tribunal's slow pace and lack of extraordinary developments favoring Chiles. Thus, while the theoretical possibility exists, the probability is very low.",

Additionally, you could further highlight that media, public, and even IOC/FIG attention have essentially no impact on SFT deliberations, which are strictly technical and insular.

The original question opened on 2024-08-20 17:22:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/27208). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nDuring the women's floor exercise final at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Jordan Chiles of the United States initially finished in fifth place. However, her coach filed an inquiry regarding her difficulty score, which resulted in Chiles being awarded an additional tenth of a point, moving her into third place and earning her the bronze medal.\n\nRomania, whose gymnasts Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea finished fourth and fifth respectively after the inquiry, protested the decision, claiming that Chiles' inquiry was filed too late. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) agreed with Romania's protest and vacated Chiles' inquiry, officially revising her score and placing her back in fifth place.\n\nAs a result, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that it would reallocate the bronze medal to Ana B\u01cerbosu. However, USA Gymnastics has [challenged](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/11/g-s1-16509/us-gymnast-jordan-chiles-bronze-medal-return) the CAS ruling, submitting video evidence that allegedly proves Chiles' inquiry was filed within the allowed time frame.\n\n[CNN reports](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/sport/jordan-chiles-bronze-olympics-controversy-explained/index.html) that the CAS does not have authority to revisit the case.\n\nA [CAS Bulletin](https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Bulletin202_2011.pdf) published in 2011 explores the issue of CAS appeals in more detail in the section \"Appeals against Arbitral Awards by the CAS\", starting on page 19 (pdf page 22). The section describes that CAS appeals are heard by the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which is essentially the supreme court of Switzerland, the particular conditions under which an appeal is typically heard, and says the following about the frequency and success of appeals:\n\n>Nowadays the CAS assumes that an appeal will be filed against approximately 10% of its arbitral awards. However, the success rate of these appeals is low. Since the CAS was established in 1984 only five appeals against CAS arbitral awards have succeeded. On average only 1% of all appeals against CAS arbitral awards were successful in 2009 and 2010. If one expresses the number of successful appeals as a percentage of all of the arbitral awards that have so far been delivered by the CAS (1984 \u2013 2010), the success rate is 0.3%.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":27208,\"question_id\":27208}}`",

The Russian Ski Federation appealed this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which is scheduled to hear its case on December 1, 2025. The ruling is expected no later than December 10, 2025. FIS announced the decision on October 21, shortly before the start of the Alpine Ski World Cup. Russia holds strong positions in FIS disciplines, particularly in cross-country skiing. In its CAS appeal, the Russian federation seeks the same participation conditions under FIS as those granted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the 2026 Winter Olympics, where athletes from Russia and Belarus may compete under the neutral designation AIN. Prior to the decision, FIS attempted to influence national federations by sending a questionnaire asking whether athletes from aggressor nations should be reinstated, arguing that athletes should not be discriminated against based on birthplace. However, when FIS leadership lacked sufficient support, it issued a brief statement announcing the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2026 Winter Olympics qualification, without commentary from its president, Johan Eliasch, who reportedly avoided commenting on what he viewed as a personal and painful defeat. The statement lacked the usual official remarks from FIS leadership, such as those from the president or general secretary.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 09:12 AM\nSource:[Rus.Postimees.ee](https://rus.postimees.ee/8368337/mezhdunarodnaya-federaciya-pytalas-povliyat-na-sportsmenov-i-vernut-rossiyan-v-sport-no-bezuspeshno-delo-doshlo-do-suda)\n\n**Pernilla Wiberg on Her Controversial Stance: 'It Has Been J\u00e4ttetufft'**\nPernilla Wiberg, a 55-year-old Swedish sports figure, expressed her disagreement with the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) 2022 decision to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from international competition following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Melnikova, 25, signed with the club earlier in November and made her debut at the second-to-last league event in Esslingen, Germany, on November 15. Although no protests occurred at the time, the city mayor, Matthias Klopfer, urged the club to reconsider her participation. On November 25, club coach Tatjana Bachmayer confirmed to Deutsche Welle that Melnikova would not compete in the final event in Heidelberg on November 29. The club's board made the decision to protect its coaches, citing a 'very tense' two-week period.

She has been photographed with the Russian military 'Z' symbol, which FIG explicitly prohibits. Melnikova also ran in Russian local elections as a candidate for United Russia, a party aligned with Putin. She declined to discuss her neutral status during an interview with SWR, responding with 'No comment.' Since 2023, FIG has permitted Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals, and three such athletes participated in the 2024 Paris Olympics trampoline events.

According to Ski Chrono, Fourcade stated, 'I did not fight for this. Some might think I feel disappointment or bitterness over what could be seen as a stolen moment of triumph. I have been rewarded for my fight against doping. My case proves that this fight still matters even 16 years later.' The medal ceremony is scheduled to take place during the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy. In September 2025, Ustyugov was stripped of his gold medal from the 2014 Sochi Olympics, as well as gold and bronze medals from the 2010 Vancouver Games, due to anti-doping rule violations identified in his past performances. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended in March 2022 that Russian and Belarusian athletes be excluded from competition, but in December 2023 it recommended allowing Russian athletes to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics under a neutral status.

The suspension stems from three missed whereabouts failures within a 12-month period between October 2024 and June 2025. In July 2025, Oleksiak voluntarily accepted a provisional suspension and did not contest the arbitral decision, agreeing to the consequences proposed by the ITA. She will be ineligible until July 2027 and will lose all individual results achieved since June 16, 2025. This includes her absence from the Paris 2024 Olympics, where she did not win medals, unlike her four medals in Rio 2016 and three in Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021 due to the pandemic). According to Suzanne Paulins, executive director of Canada's national swimming team, Oleksiak\u2019s violations were unintentional and no prohibited substances were used, but the anti-doping rules are in place to ensure fair competition. The decision may be appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but it does not prevent Oleksiak from aiming for a fourth consecutive Olympic appearance at Los Angeles 2028. Oleksiak, 25, became the first athlete born in the 21st century to win an individual Olympic gold medal in Rio 2016, tying with American Simone Manuel in the 100-meter freestyle final.

Melnikowa has refused to comment on the matter, stating 'No comment!' in a SWR interview. She had been banned from international competition since the start of the war in 2022, missing major events including the 2022 and 2023 World Championships, the 2022 and 2023 European Championships, and the 2024 Paris Olympics. Her return as a neutral athlete was marked by a gold medal performance at the 2024 World Championships in Jakarta, where she won two golds and a silver. Russian President Putin publicly congratulated her on her 'outstanding performance.' The DTL affirmed it follows FIG regulations, and the FIG declined to comment on individual cases.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 10:39 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/de/zeit-von-angelina-melnikowa-in-deutscher-turnliga-beendet/a-74877049)\n\n**Cas to Hear Russian Appeal on Olympic Participation on December 1**\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) will hear the Russian Ski Federation's appeal on December 1, 2025, in a expedited proceeding. The appeal challenges the decision by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), which, despite efforts by FIS President Johan Eliasch to align with the IOC's stance allowing individual Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano/Cortina, was rejected by the FIS executive board one month prior. The Russian Ski Federation submitted the appeal to Cas in Lausanne, Switzerland, seeking a review of FIS's decision. Cas announced that the parties will be heard via video conference on December 1, 2025, and will issue an operational decision (without reasoning) by no later than December 10, 2025. The 2026 Winter Olympics will take place from February 4 to February 22, 2026, and will be broadcast by SVT, TV4, and HBO Max.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 06:49 PM\nSource:[SVT Nyheter](https://www.svt.se/sport/langdskidor/skiljedomstolen-cas-tar-upp-ryska-overklagandet-1-december)\n\n**After Her Bronze Medal Was Stripped: Olympic Star Raises Serious Allegations**\nJordan Chiles, a U.S. gymnast, has raised serious allegations more than a year after her bronze medal in the floor final at the 2024 Paris Olympics was revoked. Initially ranked fifth, she was upgraded to third following a successful protest by the U.S. team. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) later ruled that the appeal was submitted four seconds too late, nullifying the correction. As a result, the bronze medal was awarded to Romania\u2019s Ana Barbosu, and Chiles reverted to fifth place.

Initially ranked fifth, Chiles was elevated to third place following a US appeal that raised her score by one-tenth, placing her ahead of Romania\u2019s Ana Barbosu. However, the Romanian athletic commission appealed the decision, arguing the US challenge was submitted four seconds late. The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the appeal, and the International Olympic Committee ordered Chiles to return the medal, which was reallocated to Barbosu. Over a year later, during an appearance on the 'Baby, this is Keke Palmer' podcast, Chiles stated she felt racism played a role, saying, 'They didn't want to see three beautiful Black women standing on that podium,' and cited a surge in racist and threatening social media comments that led her to temporarily leave social media. She also criticized Barbosu\u2019s coach, Patrick Kiens, for celebrating prematurely before the final decision, calling it 'highly unusual and premature.' Chiles emphasized that medal ceremonies are final unless a doping or rule violation is found, which has historically been the case at past Olympics. The incident drew international attention, including a Romanian prime minister\u2019s threat to boycott the closing ceremony. Notably, Kiens later joined the World Champions Centre in Texas, where Chiles and Simone Biles train.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 03:10 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-15284435/US-Olympics-star-makes-racism-claim-having-2024-medal-rescinded.html)\n\n**Olympics icon makes racism claim after having 2024 medal rescinded**\nUS gymnast Jordan Chiles made a racism claim regarding the rescinding of her bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the Paris 2024 Olympics.

In a September 2024 interview at the Forbes Power Women's Summit and a November 2025 podcast appearance on 'Baby, this is Keke Palmer,' Chiles stated that she initially did not consider racism as a factor until she began receiving racially charged online abuse, including threats to take her life. She noted that the historic 'all-Black' podium\u2014featuring Chiles, Simone Biles, and Rebeca Andrade\u2014was rare and apparently unwelcome to some, saying, 'they didn't want to see three beautiful Black women standing on that podium.' Chiles claimed the incident was not about the medal but about her skin color. The controversy began when a US coach appealed a scoring decision, leading to a score adjustment that moved Chiles from fifth to third place, displacing Romania\u2019s Ana Barbosu, who reacted with visible distress. After CAS ruled the appeal was submitted past the one-minute deadline, the IOC required Chiles to return the medal. Chiles and Team USA have appealed the CAS decision, arguing that the appeal was submitted on time and supported by video evidence, and that the official who ruled on the case had ties to Romania. Chiles also filed an appeal with the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, claiming she was denied a fair hearing and that video evidence was not properly considered. The CAS and USOPC jointly criticized the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) for lacking proper procedures, stating that 'a great deal of heartache would have been avoided' with better mechanisms. Barbosu, who received the bronze medal after the reversal, expressed sympathy for Chiles and teammate Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, emphasizing the Olympic spirit.

Chiles stated she initially did not consider racism as a factor until she began receiving severe racist and threatening comments on social media, including death threats, which led her to temporarily leave social media. She highlighted that the podium featured the first-ever all-Black Olympic medalists in women's gymnastics\u2014herself, Simone Biles, and Rebeca Andrade\u2014and noted that the visibility of three Black women dominating the event seemed to provoke backlash. Chiles emphasized that the incident was not just about the medal but about her identity as a woman of color. The medal was initially awarded to her after a U.S. coach appealed a scoring decision, moving her from fifth to third place, displacing Romania\u2019s Ana Barbosu, who reacted in tears. However, CAS ruled the appeal was submitted past the one-minute deadline, and the IOC ordered Chiles to return the medal. Chiles and Team USA have appealed the decision, arguing her coach submitted the appeal on time, citing video evidence, and alleging a conflict of interest involving the official who made the decision.

Initially unaware of the racial component, Chiles said she began receiving racist comments, including threats to kill herself, prompting her to leave social media. She was initially ranked fifth, but after a coach's appeal\u2014submitted four seconds after the one-minute deadline\u2014judges awarded her an extra tenth of a point, moving her to bronze.

She linked the controversy to her race, saying, 'To me, everything that has gone on is not about the medal. It's about my skin color.' She previously spoke about the incident at the Forbes Power Women's Summit in September 2024, becoming emotional while discussing the loss of recognition of her identity.

Chiles said, 'I was like, if they told me, it's a secret. I can't tell anybody. I'm not telling anybody,' and added, 'I told Laurie [Hernandez] a few weeks ago, because I just [had] seen her in person. I was like, 'Oh, she's going to love this, because she's a remarkable person, and I love her so much.'' Chiles will dance with pro Ezra Sosa in season 34. She earned a gold medal in the women\u2019s team all\u2011around at the 2024 Paris Olympics and a bronze in the individual floor exercise, which was later stripped after a scoring appeal. The controversy involved a score adjustment by coach Cecile Landi that moved Chiles to third place, prompting the Romanian Gymnastics Federation to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) ultimately awarded the bronze to Romanian gymnast Ana B\u0103rbosu, but Chiles and her legal team have continued to contest the decision, filing appeals in the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland and seeking CAS to review audio and video evidence from Netflix\u2019s \u201cRising\u201d docuseries. On the one\u2011year anniversary of the floor exercise, Chiles posted on Instagram: 'A year ago today I walked off the floor in Paris with a bronze medal -- and lessons I'll carry with me for life,' and reflected on the highs and lows of her journey. She thanked supporters who \"held me down this past year, who sent prayers, messages, and love when I needed it most,\" adding, 'You reminded me I'm never on this journey alone. I love y'all for real. You kept me standing when I didn\u2019t even know how to take the next step.' Chiles also explained that competing on the world stage prepares her for DWTS, saying, 'I feel like competing on the biggest World Stage is basically comparable to dancing in front of people.'

Chiles, 24, competed in Paris 2024, finished fourth in all\u2011around qualifying, helped Team\u202fUSA win gold in the team event, and in the floor final was initially fifth. Team\u202fUSA coach Cecile Landi appealed, and after an inquiry Chiles\u2019 score was raised by one\u2011tenth to earn bronze. The Romanian Gymnastics Federation then appealed, arguing the appeal was submitted after the one\u2011minute deadline. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that Team\u202fUSA appealed four seconds after the deadline, reinstating the bronze to Romanian gymnast Ana\u202fB\u0103rbosu. USAG appealed the CAS ruling again, but the request for reconsideration was declined. Chiles filed a new appeal with the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland on September\u202f16\u202f2025.

Chiles' coach Cecile Landi initially appealed the decision, arguing that Chiles had not been given full credit for a tour jete, a leap. However, CAS ruled in favor of the Romanians, Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voineau, citing that Chiles' inquiry was filed four seconds after the 60-second deadline. Chiles' attorneys have criticized CAS' decision, pointing out multiple flaws, including the fact that Chiles was not given sufficient notice, and that the head of the CAS panel had a potential conflict of interest. Chiles has appealed to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which is still pending. If the tribunal rules in her favor, the case will be sent back to CAS. Chiles has been busy since the Olympics, competing for UCLA and appearing in various media outlets, but the saga surrounding her medal has weighed heavily on her.

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of the decision to reallocate the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Olympics from the US to Romania being overturned before 2026 is exceedingly low. Their analyses center on several key factors: (1) The Swiss Federal Tribunal, which alone has authority to overturn a CAS award, does so in only 0.3\u20131% of cases; (2) The grounds for reversal are highly restricted to procedural irregularities or conflicts of interest, not the sporting merits; (3) Most successful appeals historically involve doping or eligibility violations rather than procedural technicalities like filing deadlines; (4) The tribunal is insulated from political/public pressure and will not re-examine substantive sporting evidence unless excluding it amounts to denial of due process; (5) Persistent media coverage, allegations of racial bias, and new video evidence raised by USAG are acknowledged but seen as unlikely to sway the outcome under current legal standards. In summary, all foresee the most probable outcome as the Swiss Federal Tribunal rejecting the appeal or finding no egregious procedural irregularity, and the medal remaining with Ana B\u01cerbosu in Romania. Experts' final probabilistic forecasts cluster tightly between 2% and 4%, indicating consensus that reversal is theoretically possible but practically extremely unlikely.",
