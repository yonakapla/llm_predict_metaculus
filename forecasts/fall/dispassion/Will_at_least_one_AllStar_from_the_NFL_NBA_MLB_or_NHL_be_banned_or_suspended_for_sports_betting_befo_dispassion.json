However, the continued growth and normalization of sports betting, the NCAA's recent liberalization (signaling shifting norms), and the sheer volume of gambling exposure (as reported in the UK and US sports markets) incrementally increase the risk of a slip-up or technical violation. The high media visibility of All-Stars also means that any infraction, however minor, is likely to be publicly disclosed and acted upon. The remaining risk window (under 3 months) is relatively short, but this is also a period where leagues frequently announce disciplinary actions.

High-profile athletes are more risk-averse and highly scrutinized, and leagues have a vested interest in both deterring and detecting violations at this level.

The original question opened on 2024-12-20 21:00:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/31106). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nEach of the four major professional sports in the US runs its own version of an All-Star game or tournament every year:\n\n* In the NFL this is called [Pro Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl). For most of the preceedin years this matched the top players in the American Football Conference (AFC) against those in the National Football Conference (NFC). However, as of December 2024 it features a series of skill competitions, such as passing challenges and precision drills, as well as a flag football game between the NFC and AFC rosters instead of a traditional full-contact game.\n* In the NBA, [it used to feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game#Rosters_selection) a game between two 12-player squads picked from each of the two conferences. This was also changed in December 2024, with the [new format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NBA_All-Star_Game) splitting the 24 players into three teams of 8 that will compete in a tournament with the winners of the Rising Stars challenge.\n* In MLB, [this is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game) a a traditional matchup between the American League and National League. Starters are chosen through fan voting, while pitchers and reserves are selected by a combination of player votes and selections by the Commissioner's Office. Each MLB team is guaranteed at least one representative.\n* In NHL, [the format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game#Formats) has changed multiple times, going from a game between two teams each selected from one of the conferences, to a single elimination tournament between four teams, representing the league's four divisions. The NHL decided to not run an All-Star game in 2025 and instead hold a new Four Nations Face-Off tournament as a preview for the league's return to Olympic participation in 2026.\n\nIn 2018, sports betting was broadly legalized in the US with the overturning of the [Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992) by the Supreme Court. Since then gambling-related suspensions and bans [have](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/24/sport/nfl-gambling-suspension-eyioma-uwazurike-spt-intl/index.html) [dramatically](https://frontofficesports.com/nbas-lifetime-ban-highlights-surge-in-gambling-related-incidents/) [increased](https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-announces-sports-betting-violation-suspensions) across sports. However, as of December 2024, this has not included any All-Stars.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

Only current players are included, former All-Star players (for example players who are now managers or coaches) do not count.\n* The ban or suspension has to happen after the player has been selected for the corresponding roster. Players that were suspended before they were selected will not resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* The main reason for the suspension or the ban has to be sports betting as mentioned in the official organization statement or as confirmed by [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).",

Both teams revealed their 32-player rosters today. The Lions selected three foreign pitchers: Fly-Lion, Lion Difin, and Mondes. The Monkeys finalized their roster with Wei Nengdi, Moshenle, and Bosailuo. The series follows a best-of-four format, with the first-half champion Lions guaranteed at least one win.

The Lions dropped rookie pitcher Oderui, who had only pitched twice against the Monkeys with a 6.84 ERA since joining in late August. The Monkeys opted to include Bosailuo, who made 15 appearances in the majors with a 3.89 ERA, over rookie left-hander Kale, who joined late and had no prior matchup against the Lions.

Across the opening weekend of the 2025\u201326 season, researchers recorded over 27,000 gambling messages across live matches, sports news, and social media, with 91% visible during live play. Over 13,000 gambling ads were shown during the restricted period, indicating the ban\u2019s failure. The report notes that more than 60% of promotions appeared during the supposed blackout window, undermining the policy\u2019s intent. Lead researcher Dr. Raffaello Rossi stated that self-regulation has clearly failed. The study also found that 8.6% of televised gambling ads came from unlicensed operators, and only 12% included harm reduction messages\u2014well below the industry\u2019s 20% target. The upcoming 2026 front-of-shirt sponsorship ban is expected to have minimal impact, as shirt ads account for less than 10% of total gambling exposure. Researchers are calling for a full, enforceable whistle-to-whistle ban across all platforms, mandatory harm reduction messaging, and stricter controls on unlicensed or misleading sponsorships. The findings align with global trends: while sportsbook advertising in the NFL declined by nearly 8% in the 2024\u20132025 season, NBA ads rose 23% and MLB impressions increased 12%. In the NHL Stanley Cup Finals, fans saw nearly 6,000 gambling messages\u2014far exceeding the 369 during the NBA Finals. Joe Maloney of the American Gaming Association argued that regulated operators' ads make up a 'low single-digit percentage' and are essential to legal sports betting, helping reduce illegal gambling. The study concludes that comprehensive legislation is needed to address the persistent saturation of gambling marketing in sports.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[ReadWrite](https://readwrite.com/5000-gambling-ads-premier-league-match-despite-ban-study/)\n\n**NCAA Approves Major Rule Change To Allow College Athletes To Bet On (Some) Sports**\nThe NCAA has approved a major rule change allowing student-athletes to bet on professional sports, pending final approval from Division II and Division III leadership. This shift comes after seven years since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2018 decision that legalized sports betting in most states, with over 75% now permitting the practice. The NCAA has previously faced scandals involving student-athletes, including investigations into men's basketball players for point shaving and football players from Iowa and Iowa State in a 2023 sting operation, many of which involved gambling on games they participated in. Currently, student-athletes are prohibited from betting on any sports sponsored by the NCAA, including the 'Big Four' leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL), soccer, golf, and tennis\u2014leading to potential workarounds and unintended consequences. The change, approved by the Division I Administrative Committee, would allow betting on professional sports starting November 1, 2025, while college sports remain off-limits. The move reflects a recognition that the previous restrictions were overly broad and out of step with the broader normalization of sports betting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:58 PM\nSource:[BroBible](https://brobible.com/sports/article/ncaa-approves-rule-change-allowing-college-athletes-bet-pro-sports/)\n\n**Fanatics Sportsbook promo for the NBA preseason: Bet $50, get $250 in...**\nThe NBA China Games are set to return in 2025, featuring two preseason matchups between the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns in Macao.

LHJMQ Commissioner Mario Cecchini acknowledged that the league aims to encourage more NHL recruiters to attend games in Quebec, stating, 'On aimerait que certains recruteurs viennent plus souvent chez nous,' and described the event as 'une occasion de venir.' The 40 players selected for the game were chosen based on requests from NHL teams, indicating which prospects they wish to evaluate. Among the most anticipated players are defenseman Xavier Villeneuve of the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada and Russian forward Egor Shilov of the Victoriaville Tigres; Lars Steiner of the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies is absent due to injury. The Quebec Remparts and Saint-Jean Sea Dogs are the most represented teams, each with six players. Cecchini, who became commissioner in May 2023, noted that despite the LHJMQ\u2019s historic success\u2014winning the Memorial Cup and a strong draft performance\u2014the league recorded its worst draft results in history, with only 12 players selected in the 2024 NHL Entry Draft. He emphasized that the decline in NHL scout attendance is not due to bias against the league, citing logistical challenges such as distance, as Ontario is only two hours away while Quebec and Western Canada are more geographically dispersed. He stated, 'Je ne sens pas qu'il y a un biais contre notre ligue,' and confirmed ongoing dialogue with NHL executives to understand recruitment patterns.

The change, announced by the Division I Administrative Committee on October 8, 2025, requires approval from Divisions II and III to take effect. While betting on college sports remains prohibited, the move aims to align NCAA policies with those of campus peers and allow institutions to focus on protecting the integrity of college athletics. The decision has sparked strong reactions from fans, with many expressing outrage on social media, citing concerns about corruption, the integrity of sports, and the potential for pre-determined outcomes. Critics argue that allowing betting could undermine college sports, especially after high-profile incidents such as Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer\u2019s 2022 Venmo transactions referencing 'sports gambling'\u2014which he claimed were inside jokes\u2014and the suspension of Pennsylvania high school soccer coach David Zimmerman for placing prop bets with students. The NCAA emphasized that the change is intended to promote healthy habits among student-athletes who choose to gamble on professional sports, while still safeguarding college competition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 06:50 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-15174723/NCAA-controversial-rule-change-college-sports-stars-GAMBLE.html)\n\n**Over 5,000 gambling ads seen during Premier League match despite ban, study finds**\nA University of Bristol study found that over 5,000 gambling advertisements were shown during a single Premier League match\u2014Wolverhampton Wanderers vs. Manchester City\u2014despite the industry's voluntary 'whistle to whistle' ban, which prohibits gambling ads during live play and five minutes before and after matches broadcast before 9 p.m. The study, titled 'Gambling Marketing and the Premier League: Continued Saturation and Failed Self Regulation,' revealed that 5,262 gambling messages appeared in that game, the highest in any broadcast study. Across the opening weekend of the 2025\u201326 season, researchers recorded over 27,000 gambling messages across live matches, sports news, and social media, with 91% visible during live play. Over 13,000 gambling ads were shown during the restricted period, indicating the ban\u2019s failure. The report notes that more than 60% of promotions appeared during the supposed blackout window, undermining the policy\u2019s intent. Lead researcher Dr. Raffaello Rossi stated that self-regulation has clearly failed. The study also found that 8.6% of televised gambling ads came from unlicensed operators, and only 12% included harm reduction messages\u2014well below the industry\u2019s 20% target. The upcoming 2026 front-of-shirt sponsorship ban is expected to have minimal impact, as shirt ads account for less than 10% of total gambling exposure. Researchers are calling for a full, enforceable whistle-to-whistle ban across all platforms, mandatory harm reduction messaging, and stricter controls on unlicensed or misleading sponsorships. The findings align with global trends: while sportsbook advertising in the NFL declined by nearly 8% in the 2024\u20132025 season, NBA ads rose 23% and MLB impressions increased 12%. In the NHL Stanley Cup Finals, fans saw nearly 6,000 gambling messages\u2014far exceeding the 369 during the NBA Finals. Joe Maloney of the American Gaming Association argued that regulated operators' ads make up a 'low single-digit percentage' and are essential to legal sports betting, helping reduce illegal gambling. The study concludes that comprehensive legislation is needed to address the persistent saturation of gambling marketing in sports.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[ReadWrite](https://readwrite.com/5000-gambling-ads-premier-league-match-despite-ban-study/)\n\n**NCAA Approves Major Rule Change To Allow College Athletes To Bet On (Some) Sports**\nThe NCAA has approved a major rule change allowing student-athletes to bet on professional sports, pending final approval from Division II and Division III leadership. This shift comes after seven years since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2018 decision that legalized sports betting in most states, with over 75% now permitting the practice. The NCAA has previously faced scandals involving student-athletes, including investigations into men's basketball players for point shaving and football players from Iowa and Iowa State in a 2023 sting operation, many of which involved gambling on games they participated in. Currently, student-athletes are prohibited from betting on any sports sponsored by the NCAA, including the 'Big Four' leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL), soccer, golf, and tennis\u2014leading to potential workarounds and unintended consequences. The change, approved by the Division I Administrative Committee, would allow betting on professional sports starting November 1, 2025, while college sports remain off-limits. The move reflects a recognition that the previous restrictions were overly broad and out of step with the broader normalization of sports betting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:58 PM\nSource:[BroBible](https://brobible.com/sports/article/ncaa-approves-rule-change-allowing-college-athletes-bet-pro-sports/)\n\n**NCAA Division I votes to allow college athletes to bet on professional sports**\nThe NCAA Division I Administrative Committee approved a recommendation on October 8, 2025, to allow college athletes to legally wager on professional sports, marking a major shift from longstanding restrictions. The change, which requires approval from Division II and Division III to take effect, will go into force on November 1, 2025. According to Illinois athletic director and committee chairman Josh Whitman, the rule change enables the NCAA, conferences, and member schools to focus on protecting the integrity of college games while promoting healthy betting habits among student-athletes. The proposal, initiated after the Division I Board of Directors directed rule changes, does not lift the longstanding ban on betting on college games. The NCAA continues to prohibit athletes, coaches, and staff from sharing insider information with bettors and bans gambling-related advertising at championship events like March Madness. The move follows a surge in NCAA investigations into gambling violations, including the permanent suspension of three Division I basketball players for betting on their own games and the ongoing investigation of 13 players from six men\u2019s basketball programs. Thirty-eight U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico now have legal sports gambling, with age limits ranging from 18 to 21. The NCAA collaborates with monitoring companies to detect improper betting and has intensified educational efforts to inform athletes about gambling risks. A recent NCAA study also linked the rise in legal wagering to increased online harassment of athletes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 04:53 PM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6700539/2025/10/08/ncaa-gambling-student-athletes-professional-sports/)\n\n**NBA announces innovative new plan to ruin the All-Star Game**\nThe article argues that the NBA All\u2011Star Game has become a \"mess\" and \"embarrassing\" event, with players showing little effort. It criticises commissioner Adam Silver for being \"too player\u2011friendly\" and for experimenting with formats that have not improved the weekend. The piece notes that the Slam Dunk Contest has relied on rookies and G\u2011League players, the 3\u2011point Contest has struggled to attract star shooters, and the Skills Contest was marred by a \"cheap win\" from Victor Wembanyama and Chris Paul. It describes the All\u2011Star Game itself as \"lazy\" and \"uncontested\", and says Silver has tried various formats, including East\u2011vs\u2011West and a four\u2011team tournament chosen by Inside the NBA. The article reports that the 2026 All\u2011Star Game will use a three\u2011team round\u2011robin with two American teams and one international squad, a change that the author doubts will succeed. The author compares the NBA to other sports, noting that hockey and baseball have found success while the NFL\u2019s Pro Bowl is \"dead\". The piece concludes that to revive the weekend, the NBA must improve the preliminary events, such as making the Slam Dunk Contest a $5\u202fmillion prize and featuring high\u2011profile matchups like Sabrina\u202fIonescu vs. Steph\u202fCurry, and possibly adding a 1\u2011on\u20111 tournament.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 05:24 PM\nSource:[FanSided](https://fansided.com/nba/nba-announces-innovative-new-plan-ruin-all-star-game)\n\n**Report: NBA to have 2 U.S. teams, 1 World team in All-Star Game**\nThe NBA is planning a new All\u2011Star Game format for 2026 that will feature two U.S. teams and one international team competing in a round\u2011robin tournament with 12\u2011minute quarters, according to ESPN. The event will move from a Sunday night slot to Sunday afternoon and will be held on Feb.\u202f15 at the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 home arena in Inglewood, California, with NBC as the new television partner. The change follows the 2025 format\u2014a mini\u2011tournament that was widely criticized\u2014where three All\u2011Star teams were drafted by captains and a fourth team was the winner of the Rising Stars Challenge; the games were played to a target score of 40 points instead of a game clock, and television ratings for the Feb.\u202f16 event in San Francisco fell 13\u202fpercent. NBA commissioner Adam Silver commented, 'I thought we made almost an immeasurable amount of progress. I thought this was a little better, but it was a miss. We're not there in terms of creating an All\u2011Star experience that we can be proud of, that our players can be proud of.' When asked whether the NBA might adopt a format similar to the NHL\u2019s Four Nations Face\u2011Off, Silver replied, 'I'm not sure that makes sense, with the level of development, if that's fair to lump all the other countries together these days.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 03:16 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/us-sports/report-nba-to-have-2-u-s-teams-1-world-team-in-all-star-game-101756955774360.html)\n\n**USA vs World To Finally Take Place! NBA Plans To Bring In New All-Star Game Format**\nThe NBA is preparing a radical new format for its 2026 All\u2011Star Game, slated for February 15 at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California. According to reports from The Athletic and AP, the structure will feature three teams of eight players each: two American squads (Team USA\u202f1 and Team USA\u202f2) and one international squad (Team World). The matchups will be short, round\u2011robin games to determine a winner, with a total of 16 American All\u2011Stars and eight international stars\u2014roughly mirroring the league\u2019s current player composition of about 70\u202f% U.S. and 30\u202f% overseas. The proposal has already received positive feedback from the NBA\u2019s competition committee, and Commissioner Adam Silver has acknowledged that a straight U.S. vs. World game would be difficult to balance because of the numerical disparity between American and international players.\n\nThe change comes after the 2024 All\u2011Star Game ended in a 211\u2011186 no\u2011defense shootout that was widely criticized for its lack of competitiveness. In 2025, the NBA experimented with a four\u2011team, untimed tournament format that also failed to resonate with players and fans. Silver has cited other sports, such as the NHL\u2019s 4 Nations Face\u2011Off, as inspiration for a more country\u2011versus\u2011country intensity.\n\nSeveral stars\u2014including Victor Wembanyama, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Draymond Green\u2014have openly supported the U.S. vs. World concept. The new format would therefore represent the league\u2019s most dramatic All\u2011Star shake\u2011up in years, aiming to reinvigorate the mid\u2011season showcase.\n\nThe 2026 All\u2011Star Game will take place during the Milan\u2011Cortina Winter Olympics, adding a global context to the event.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 03:12 AM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/sports/usa-vs-world-to-finally-take-place-nba-plans-to-bring-in-new-all-star-game-format-ws-l-9547932.html)\n\n**NBA All\u2011Star Game to Adopt League Format with Two US Teams and a World Selection**\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) will reformat its All\u2011Star Game for February\u202f2026 as a league\u2011style contest featuring two United States teams and a world\u2011selection team, according to a report by ESPN and other sports outlets on 3\u202fSeptember\u202f2025. The decision follows last season\u2019s 4\u2011team tournament format, which received negative feedback. The change was welcomed by league officials and the players\u2019 union. The move was inspired in part by the National Hockey League\u2019s 2025 All\u2011Star event, which replaced the traditional game with a 4\u2011country match between Canada, the United States, and two other nations, a format that was well received, as reported by the Associated Press.

The change follows the previous season\u2019s 4\u2011team tournament format, which received negative feedback.

The idea was partly inspired by the successful 4\u2011country match in the National Hockey League (NHL) this year, where Canada, the United States and two other nations competed after the All\u2011Star Game was cancelled. The new format will involve a total of 4 teams: two U.S. teams, one world\u2011select team, and a separate world\u2011select side, as stated in the article.

According to the article, the 24 NBA All\u2011Stars will be divided into three eight\u2011player rosters: one World team and two American teams, with the games returning to full\u2011length play. The change follows a 2025 contest that was criticized for its fragmented format and extended ceremonies. Commissioner Adam Silver has promoted the new format, citing the success of the NHL\u2019s 4 Nations Face\u2011Off and the 2024 Olympic men\u2019s basketball tournament as evidence that national pride can boost fan interest. ESPN\u2019s Shams Charania confirms the structure, noting that the 2026 broadcast could offer multiple full\u2011length games, potentially extending the network\u2019s coverage. The article also highlights potential challenges, such as ensuring enough international players to fill the World roster, referencing the 2025 TNT draft where Charles Barkley had to adjust his \"Global Stars\" selection to form a complete team.

The league\u2019s competition committee has responded positively, though the format remains unfinalised. In April, Commissioner Adam Silver and President of League Operations Byron Spruell said the NBA and NBC were discussing an \u2018international competition\u2019 for the 2026 All\u2011Star Game, which would be held on Feb.\u202f15 at the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles (source: Associated Press). Silver noted that the game would coincide with NBC\u2019s coverage of the Milan\u2011Cortina Winter Olympics and that moving the game to a Sunday afternoon tip\u2011off would allow Olympic broadcasts before and after the game (quote: 'I think all of those factors, when they come together, it presents an enormous opportunity for us to do something with an international competition instead of the traditional All\u2011Star formats that we've used'). The proposed format follows the NHL\u2019s 4 Nations Face\u2011Off, which replaced its All\u2011Star Game with an international mini\u2011tournament that drew record viewership (source: article). Roughly 25\u202f% of current NBA players were born outside the U.S., and for eight consecutive seasons the MVP has been awarded to a non\u2011U.S. player, with at least ten international players selected in every draft since 2010 (source: article). The NBA has previously experimented with All\u2011Star formats, such as the four\u2011team tournament last season, which was criticised for gimmicks and long stoppages and was the second\u2011lowest\u2011rated All\u2011Star Game, with viewership down 13\u202f% from the 2024 game (source: article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 12:39 AM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6596517/2025/09/03/nba-all-star-game-new-format-2026/)\n\n**NBA solves major problem for USA vs. the World**\nLast year\u2019s NBA All\u2011Star Game was criticized for being non\u2011competitive, partly due to distractions such as a Mr. Beast shooting contest and an extended tribute to 'Inside the NBA' (the article notes these distractions). The NHL, meanwhile, ran a successful '4 Nations Face\u2011Off', replacing its All\u2011Star Game (the article says the NHL sponsored a round\u2011robin tournament featuring teams from the USA, Canada, Finland and Norway, with Canada defeating the USA 3\u20112 in overtime). The NBA\u2019s current proposal is to replace the traditional 'USA vs. World' format with a round\u2011robin tournament featuring three eight\u2011player teams, only one of which is all\u2011international (the article states: 'Three eight\u2011player teams will compete, with only one of them being full of international players'). Last year\u2019s format had teams drafted by Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith, essentially split into an international team, a team of older legends and a team of younger All\u2011Stars (the article describes Team Chuck, Team Shaq and Team Kenny). Only seven of the 26 All\u2011Stars were international, and the last seven NBA MVPs were born outside the United States (the article gives these numbers). The NBA\u2019s new format removes a fourth team, potentially excluding 'G\u2011League' players, but it may not increase competitiveness (the article says: 'there's no guarantee the games will be more competitive'). Players\u2019 focus on playoff health also undermines the event; James withdrew from the 2025 game early and sat out the second half in 2023 (the article mentions this). The article concludes that the change is another attempt to tweak 'All\u2011Star Weekend', with Silver pushing a proposal to save the weekend (the article states: 'Don't be surprised if this time next year, Silver is advancing yet another proposal to save All\u2011Star Weekend').\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 12:17 AM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_solves_major_problem_for_usa_vs_the_world/s1_13132_42683614)\n\n**WAMC Sports Report 6/27/25: Judge, Ohtani elected to start in All-Star Game as top vote-getters**\nAaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani have been elected as starters for the July 15 All-Star Game at Atlanta's Truist Park, receiving the most votes from fans.

    "summary": "Experts across legal, risk, management, criminology, and sociological perspectives largely agree that the probability of at least one All-Star from the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL being banned or suspended for sports betting before 2026 remains modest but non-negligible. The base rate\u2014no All-Star suspension since US legalization in 2018\u2014strongly depresses probabilities, as All-Stars are seen as highly risk-averse, invested in their reputations, and subject to intense compliance regimes and education. The consensus is that leagues have robust monitoring and would act rapidly if a scandal at that level emerged. Factors that increase probability include the explosive normalization and saturation of sports betting (intense advertising, societal acceptance), recent NCAA policy changes allowing athlete betting on pro sports, generational shifts, and the growing number of violations among non-All-Star players. The short remaining timeframe (under three months) and absence of current All-Star investigations or rumors are cited as significant reasons against a Yes resolution. Forecasts range mainly from 6% to 22%, with most clustering between 7% and 18%. Sociological and subcultural perspectives are slightly more bullish (up to 22%), emphasizing shifting norms and the cumulative risk as the All-Star pool refreshes each year, though still well below even odds. All experts agree the historical status quo is strong, but the shifting environment does edge risk upward. No specific rumors or investigations are currently public, leaving the verdict as low but not negligible risk by the end of 2025.",
