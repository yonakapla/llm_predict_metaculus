U.S. shale is constrained, but this is outweighed by global supply increases. U.S. gasoline demand shows no signs of a major rebound, and macroeconomic indicators are softening.

The most active sectors were cyclical commodities and technology, while energy lagged due to a sharp drop in oil prices following rumors of a new OPEC+ production increase in November. Wall Street also finished with modest gains, as investors awaited negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to secure a federal funding agreement and avoid a government shutdown starting Wednesday. President Donald Trump met with congressional leaders at the White House yesterday, but the meeting yielded no significant progress. The piece notes that the U.S. government has shut down four times since 2013, typically for short periods with limited market impact, yet the current situation is more concerning because investors are anxious about the upcoming non\u2011agricultural employment report from the Department of Labor on Friday. If the shutdown occurs, the data\u2011generating departments will be closed, potentially causing a negative market reaction. In addition to the U.S. negotiations, European investors face a heavy macro\u2011economic agenda: preliminary September CPI readings in Germany and France, and Spain\u2019s inflation rate reaching its highest level in seven months. The article expects a slight uptick in inflation in Germany and France due to energy prices, but still within \"acceptable\" levels for the ECB. In the U.S., the September consumer confidence index and the August JOLTS report are scheduled for release later today; a stronger\u2011than\u2011expected JOLTS could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. The multinational NIKE (NIKE\u2011US) will also announce its quarterly results, and analysts will watch for comments on how new tariffs are affecting prices, demand, and margins. The author predicts that European indices will open mixed today, with no major attempts at market \"make\u2011up\" despite the month\u2011end and quarter\u2011end timing. The article also notes that Asian markets closed mixed, the dollar slipped slightly against major currencies, bond yields remained stable, oil prices continued to fall, gold rose, and major cryptocurrencies edged lower. The commentary uses quotes such as 'aceptables', 'deprimido', and 'severamente' to describe inflation expectations, consumer sentiment, and market conditions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 07:47 AM\nSource:[Bolsamania](https://www.bolsamania.com/capitalbolsa/noticias/bolsa/comentario-de-apertura-a-la-espera-del-posible-cierre-del-gobierno-de-eeuusera-esta-vez-diferente--20969256.html)\n\n**Oil Companies Accuse Trump of Ending America\u2019s Golden Age: \u2018Fracking Era Is Over\u2019**\nThe article reports that U.S. oil companies, once buoyed by President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018drill\u2011baby\u2011drill\u2019 policy, are now facing a crisis. A recent Dallas Federal Reserve survey of industry executives shows that most firms feel trapped by rising costs, falling shale prices and a glut of oil. One respondent said, 'El negocio del esquisto estadounidense est\u00e1 en crisis', and another added, 'Lo que una vez fue el motor energ\u00e9tico m\u00e1s din\u00e1mico del mundo ha sido destrozado por la hostilidad pol\u00edtica y la ignorancia econ\u00f3mica'. The WTI price has dropped 10\u202f% to about $60 a barrel, the level at which a new well in the Permian Basin is barely profitable. Goldman Sachs forecasts prices of $58 in 2025 and $51 in 2026, while Randstad Energy warns that 50 platforms could shut down in 2025 if current prices persist.

Executives blame Trump\u2019s alignment with OPEC and tariff policies for driving prices below $40 a barrel, a level that would make drilling unviable.

Although crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum imports are largely exempt, industry analysts fear that the tariff regime could fuel inflation, slow growth and raise trade tensions, thereby putting downward pressure on oil prices. A GlobalData poll conducted from May to August 2025 surveyed 204 industry respondents. The poll found that a little over 25% of participants expected the tariff impact to last six months to one year, a slightly smaller group projected an impact of up to three years, 22% were uncertain, and 14% believed the effect could extend beyond five years. The respondents noted that the uncertainty has made planning new developments extremely challenging. The article cites the poll\u2019s diverse responses as reflecting the broader uncertainty in the US oil and gas industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:50 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

President Trump, meanwhile, has claimed that the economy is booming, that inflation has been defeated, and that under his leadership energy, gasoline, grocery, and mortgage costs are down. The article cites the latest consumer price index (CPI) from the Department of Labor, noting the annual inflation rate rose to 2.9\u202f% in August from 2.7\u202f% in July, and that the food\u2011at\u2011home index increased 2.7\u202f% over the previous 12\u202fmonths. An AP\u2011NORC poll in mid\u20112025 found 53\u202f% of American adults identified grocery expenses as a major source of stress, 33\u202f% as a minor issue, and 64\u202f% of low\u2011income households cited grocery prices as a significant stressor; only 20\u202f% of households earning $100,000 or more said grocery prices were not a concern. A Gallup poll in early September reported the Economic Confidence Index at \u201320\u202f%, with 28\u202f% rating current conditions as positive and 68\u202f% saying conditions were getting worse, compared with \u201328 in September of the previous year and a low of \u201358 in June\u202f2022. The article also references a Morning Consult poll from July that found six in ten people blamed Trump for driving up the cost of living, and 70\u202f% of Republicans worried that tariffs would raise everyday prices. It includes quotes from Trump\u2019s UN General Assembly address, where he claimed he was reversing the \"economic calamity\" inherited from the previous administration, and from Moody\u2019s Chief Economist Mark\u202fZandi, who said neither Trump nor Biden was to blame for high inflation, attributing it instead to the pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine. The piece concludes with a note that the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome highlighted persistent labor\u2011market weaknesses and upside inflation risks, warning that the central bank would need to approach further rate cuts with caution.\n\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 11:31 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/women-for-trump-co-founder-blasts-outrageous-grocery-prices-10802853)\n\n**Ten indicators of what's going on with America's economy**\nTen indicators show that America\u2019s economic growth is slowing. GDP for the first quarter of 2025 shrank because tariff front\u2011running pushed goods into the U.S. before deadlines, while the second quarter rebounded strongly. Private spending and investment remain positive but have slowed sharply, and payroll figures have been revised downward. Inflation rose to 2.6% in June, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and the BLS sample for the latest figures was reduced by more than 15%. After a weak jobs report on August\u202f1, President Donald Trump said he would fire the BLS commissioner responsible, a move described as \"a remarkable act of political interference.\" Stock markets recovered to historic highs, yet the S&P\u202f500 closed the week 2.5\u202f% lower after the July\u202f31\u2011August\u202f1 tariff wave. Consumer sentiment dipped to its lowest level since mid\u20112022 following Trump\u2019s tariff announcements in April, and long\u2011term inflation expectations are at their highest in decades. Unemployment remains low, but hiring has slowed, and the Economic Policy Uncertainty index has spiked again, though slightly below April\u2019s peaks. Trump\u2019s promised $2\u202ftrillion cuts have not materialized; federal spending is running ahead of previous years. Mortgage rates averaged 6.81\u202f% in April, curbing home sales and construction, and the dollar has weakened against most major currencies since Trump took office, potentially adding to inflation. The article presents a critical view of Trump\u2019s economic policies, highlighting the challenges posed by tariffs, political interference, and fiscal uncertainty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 10:06 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/global/ten-indicators-of-what-s-going-on-with-america-s-economy-11759226549409.html)\n\n**Opening Commentary: Awaiting the Possible US Government Shutdown\u2014Will It Be Different This Time?**\nThe article reports that European stock indices closed the previous day in a mixed, largely unchanged state, with minimal price swings. The most active sectors were cyclical commodities and technology, while energy lagged due to a sharp drop in oil prices following rumors of a new OPEC+ production increase in November. Wall Street also finished with modest gains, as investors awaited negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to secure a federal funding agreement and avoid a government shutdown starting Wednesday. President Donald Trump met with congressional leaders at the White House yesterday, but the meeting yielded no significant progress. The piece notes that the U.S. government has shut down four times since 2013, typically for short periods with limited market impact, yet the current situation is more concerning because investors are anxious about the upcoming non\u2011agricultural employment report from the Department of Labor on Friday. If the shutdown occurs, the data\u2011generating departments will be closed, potentially causing a negative market reaction. In addition to the U.S. negotiations, European investors face a heavy macro\u2011economic agenda: preliminary September CPI readings in Germany and France, and Spain\u2019s inflation rate reaching its highest level in seven months. The article expects a slight uptick in inflation in Germany and France due to energy prices, but still within \"acceptable\" levels for the ECB. In the U.S., the September consumer confidence index and the August JOLTS report are scheduled for release later today; a stronger\u2011than\u2011expected JOLTS could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. The multinational NIKE (NIKE\u2011US) will also announce its quarterly results, and analysts will watch for comments on how new tariffs are affecting prices, demand, and margins. The author predicts that European indices will open mixed today, with no major attempts at market \"make\u2011up\" despite the month\u2011end and quarter\u2011end timing. The article also notes that Asian markets closed mixed, the dollar slipped slightly against major currencies, bond yields remained stable, oil prices continued to fall, gold rose, and major cryptocurrencies edged lower. The commentary uses quotes such as 'aceptables', 'deprimido', and 'severamente' to describe inflation expectations, consumer sentiment, and market conditions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 07:47 AM\nSource:[Bolsamania](https://www.bolsamania.com/capitalbolsa/noticias/bolsa/comentario-de-apertura-a-la-espera-del-posible-cierre-del-gobierno-de-eeuusera-esta-vez-diferente--20969256.html)\n\n**Will U.S. Agriculture Affect Next Midterm Elections?

A recent Dallas Federal Reserve survey of industry executives shows that most firms feel trapped by rising costs, falling shale prices and a glut of oil. One respondent said, 'El negocio del esquisto estadounidense est\u00e1 en crisis', and another added, 'Lo que una vez fue el motor energ\u00e9tico m\u00e1s din\u00e1mico del mundo ha sido destrozado por la hostilidad pol\u00edtica y la ignorancia econ\u00f3mica'.

Although crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum imports are largely exempt, industry analysts fear that the tariff regime could fuel inflation, slow growth and raise trade tensions, thereby putting downward pressure on oil prices. A GlobalData poll conducted from May to August 2025 surveyed 204 industry respondents. The poll found that a little over 25% of participants expected the tariff impact to last six months to one year, a slightly smaller group projected an impact of up to three years, 22% were uncertain, and 14% believed the effect could extend beyond five years.

In New\u202fJersey, the steepest increases were 25% for residential and 16% for commercial use, a spike that has become a focal point in the governor\u2019s race.  The piece attributes the surge to two structural drivers: a 30\u202fGW rise in demand from data centers out of a projected 32\u202fGW increase between 2024\u20112030, and the need to upgrade an aging transmission grid, both of which push costs into consumer bills.  Politically, former President Donald\u202fTrump\u2019s campaign promise to halve electricity prices is highlighted as unfulfilled; he blamed the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cdecoupling\u201d policies and called wind and solar a \u201ccentury scam.\u201d  The article quotes Charles\u202fHua of PowerLines, who said, '\u96fb\u50f9\u6f32\u5e45\u4f4d\u5c45\u5404\u985e\u5546\u54c1\u4e4b\u9996\uff0c\u52e2\u5fc5\u5f15\u767c\u653f\u6cbb\u98a8\u66b4,' and a dairy farmer, Eran\u202fWajswol, who complained that a 19% price jump in two months forced him to cut profit margins.

The latest jobs report was a clear blow to the Republican president, showing a loss of tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs since the imposition of the tariffs in April. Trump's dismissal of the agency responsible for releasing employment data has sparked widespread controversy over the integrity of official institutions. Data on inflation has also shown a rise in consumer prices, particularly for imported goods, adding to the pressure on citizens. The country's GDP has grown at a modest annual rate of 1.3% in the first half of the year, a sharp decline from last year. Trump's economic strategy, based on tax cuts, reduced spending, and escalated trade wars, is considered a highly risky political move, especially as midterm elections approach. Experts believe that the full impact of the tariffs will not be seen until 2026, which could negatively affect Republicans in future elections. The White House sees what is happening as a 'rebalancing' phase, and that better times are ahead, but public opinion polls show a decline in public trust in Trump's economic performance. Only 38% of Americans expressed satisfaction, a decline from 50% at the end of his previous term. Trump has not spared the Federal Reserve from criticism, demanding an immediate reduction in interest rates, ignoring warnings of its impact on inflation rates. Trump supported Federal Reserve conservatives in favor of lowering interest rates, despite their differing reasons with his orientations. At the end of last year, former President Joe Biden issued a clear warning of the consequences of comprehensive tariffs, emphasizing that the American consumer -- not foreign countries -- would bear the cost. Now, the effects of this burden are clearly visible in the markets and productive sectors.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 03, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/world-news/1399974/%D8%A3%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%82%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%B0%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8)\n\n**Commentary: Trump has an energy problem  --  and it's not gasoline**\nPresident Trump's promise of cheap energy and lower inflation is being challenged by rising household energy costs, which have jumped 7.1% in the past year.

According to Reuters, Brent oil futures rose by 4 cents to $70.23 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate oil fell by 1 cent to $68.37 per barrel. The weakening of the US dollar on Asian markets supports oil prices, said OANDA's senior analyst Calvin Wong, as it makes oil cheaper for owners of other currencies. Additionally, the increase in US crude oil inventories, combined with a decrease in gasoline and distillate inventories last week, also supports oil prices, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA reported that gasoline demand increased by 6% last week to 9.2 million barrels per day. Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian exports to the US, as well as his plans to impose tariffs on copper, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, have raised concerns about inflationary pressure from Trump's tariffs.

U.S. crude oil production is projected to drop from 13.4 million barrels per day in Q2 2025 to below 13.3 million b/d by Q4 2026. The EIA blames the price forecast increase miss on overestimating U.S. oil production and underestimating demand. The report also notes that the U.S. Commerce Department has lifted export license requirements for ethane exports to China, leading to an increase in U.S. ethane exports. The article also discusses the impact of the trade war on inflation, with the author arguing that it has not significantly contributed to inflation and that President Trump's Big Beautiful Bill will lead to lower inflation. Additionally, the article notes that global diesel inventories are at the lowest level since 1996, and that the diesel crack spread has hit the highest level since the US attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The author believes that the supply squeeze is not over yet and that the market should be prepared for a surge in oil and gas demand. Natural gas prices remain low, but are expected to rise next year due to a slight production drop in 2026. Wholesale power prices are expected to increase by 12% this summer compared to last summer, contributing to higher electricity bills. The article also discusses the impact of weather on power and natural gas, with torrential rain causing catastrophic flooding in Texas, New Mexico, and North Carolina.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a supportive weekly status report, and President Trump suggested that the US had a deal with China. However, tensions with Iran are rising, with the country opening a new uranium enrichment facility and increasing production of highly enriched fissile material. This has cast a shadow over Iran-US nuclear talks, with Senator Tom Cotton and Senator Lindsy Graham stating that Iran must completely dismantle its enrichment program to prevent a nuclear weapon. The market believes that if the talks fail, an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities may occur, which would increase the risk of oil supply disruptions. The economic backdrop is bullish for the oil market, with a tame CPI report and a positive impact from tariffs on the US economy. Fitch Rating service has a negative outlook for the oil and gas sector, but this is not supported by economic data or market prices. The EIA reported a surge in gasoline demand and a decrease in US commercial crude oil inventories. Natural gas is also surging higher due to shifting weather forecasts and increased tensions in the Middle East. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated, 'The natural gas story has been a great story...It has been a great story of lowering costs for American consumers and giving great security to our allies abroad, and growing the geopolitical influence of the United States.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 05:09 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-bullish-tensions-boiling-over-200662147)\n\n**Trump's Energy Dominance Strategy Faces Challenges as Oil Prices Decline**\nUS President Donald Trump's energy dominance strategy is facing difficulties due to the decline in oil prices and subsequent drilling activity contraction. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the US oil production is expected to decrease for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, from 1.35 million barrels per day in 2024 to 1.33 million barrels per day in 2025. This is due to the increased costs caused by Trump's trade war and the subsequent decrease in oil demand. The EIA also reported that the number of operating drilling rigs in the US has decreased, and is expected to continue to decline to 442 by 2026. The price of oil has also continued to decline, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price closing at $64.98 per barrel on June 10, a 17% decrease from its high point this year. The EIA predicts that international oil prices will fall below $60 per barrel in 2025. Trump's trade war has caused instability in the global economy, leading to a decrease in oil prices. Some analysts predict a more significant decline in oil production, with S&P Global Commodities Insights predicting a total production decrease of 640,000 barrels per day from mid-2025 to the end of 2025. This is a larger decline than some OPEC member countries. The Financial Times reported that Trump's promise to increase oil drilling and production during his presidential campaign has been officially downgraded to a pessimistic forecast just a few months later.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 02:43 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/world/11339753)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all experts, the consensus is that inflation-adjusted US gas prices are unlikely to rise in 2025, with forecast probabilities for a year-on-year increase generally ranging from 22% to 35%. The dominant factors cited are (1) a projected global oil supply surplus due to OPEC+ production increases, which is expected to put downward pressure on crude oil and thus gasoline prices, (2) weak US and global economic growth that is dampening gasoline demand, and (3) softening US shale output, which reduces domestic supply but is more than offset by the global glut. Tariffs and a weakening dollar are noted as modestly inflationary, but experts generally believe their direct impact on real gas prices is limited due to exemptions on petroleum imports and the offsetting effect of broader economic weakness. Historical base rates show that, absent major exogenous supply shocks (such as war or severe weather), real US gasoline prices are flat or decline more often than they rise in a given year. Upside risks (scenarios where inflation-adjusted gas prices do rise) involve low-probability events like geopolitical crises, major refinery outages, or a sudden OPEC+ policy reversal. However, no expert sees such shocks as the likely scenario based on the current data and news. Therefore, the aggregate expert view is that a year-over-year rise in real (inflation-adjusted) US gasoline prices in December 2025 is unlikely, with the probability consensus in the 22%\u201335% range and no forecast above 40%.",
