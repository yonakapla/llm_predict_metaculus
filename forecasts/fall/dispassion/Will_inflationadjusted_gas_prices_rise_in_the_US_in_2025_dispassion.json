While tariffs and a weaker dollar introduce inflationary risk, these are already reflected in broader CPI, and gasoline-specific inflation is mild. Recent EIA, Goldman Sachs, and industry forecasts all point to lower or flat oil prices into 2026. There is no evidence of major refinery outages or supply shocks on the horizon. Political and economic pressures are more likely to suppress demand than lift prices. Thus, barring an unpredictable exogenous shock, the preponderance of evidence suggests December 2025 inflation-adjusted gas prices will not rise above December 2024 levels.

EIA and major banks forecast lower or flat oil prices into 2026. US gas prices have a strong status quo bias and rarely rise in real terms absent a supply shock. While a weaker dollar and potential one-off disruptions raise the probability slightly, the dominant scenario is that inflation-adjusted gasoline prices will not rise.

Tariff-induced inflation could raise the CPI denominator, but direct impacts on gas are limited due to exemptions. While there are inflationary pressures in other parts of the US economy (food, electricity), the gasoline market is more exposed to global supply/demand than to US-specific inflation, and weak demand plus oversupply are likely to outweigh any mild USD weakness or tariff pass-through. The risk of a supply-shock-driven price spike exists but is not strongly indicated in the current data.

Although US shale contraction and macro uncertainty could create upside risk, these are currently overwhelmed by the global context. Tariffs, while inflationary in other sectors, are not biting directly into oil/gas, and their net effect is to slow growth and demand more than to raise energy costs. Inflation is running above target, but not enough to offset the oil price decline unless there is an unexpected surge. Base rates, the status quo, and the preponderance of macro/energy signals suggest the most probable outcome is a flat or lower real gas price year-over-year.

The best arguments emphasized that even with ongoing inflation, nominal prices must outpace CPI to yield a real gain, which is unlikely in the current context.

My initial probability of 20% is at the lower end of this consensus, primarily due to my heavy weighting of the status quo and base rates. However, the group argumentation highlighted that while a major supply/demand shock is not currently present, the ever-present volatility of energy markets and the slight but not negligible risk of dollar weakness or late-year disruptions suggest a probability closer to 25% may be better calibrated.

The most active sectors were cyclical commodities and technology, while energy lagged due to a sharp drop in oil prices following rumors of a new OPEC+ production increase in November. Wall Street also finished with modest gains, as investors awaited negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to secure a federal funding agreement and avoid a government shutdown starting Wednesday. President Donald Trump met with congressional leaders at the White House yesterday, but the meeting yielded no significant progress. The piece notes that the U.S. government has shut down four times since 2013, typically for short periods with limited market impact, yet the current situation is more concerning because investors are anxious about the upcoming non\u2011agricultural employment report from the Department of Labor on Friday. If the shutdown occurs, the data\u2011generating departments will be closed, potentially causing a negative market reaction. In addition to the U.S. negotiations, European investors face a heavy macro\u2011economic agenda: preliminary September CPI readings in Germany and France, and Spain\u2019s inflation rate reaching its highest level in seven months. The article expects a slight uptick in inflation in Germany and France due to energy prices, but still within \"acceptable\" levels for the ECB. In the U.S., the September consumer confidence index and the August JOLTS report are scheduled for release later today; a stronger\u2011than\u2011expected JOLTS could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. The multinational NIKE (NIKE\u2011US) will also announce its quarterly results, and analysts will watch for comments on how new tariffs are affecting prices, demand, and margins. The author predicts that European indices will open mixed today, with no major attempts at market \"make\u2011up\" despite the month\u2011end and quarter\u2011end timing. The article also notes that Asian markets closed mixed, the dollar slipped slightly against major currencies, bond yields remained stable, oil prices continued to fall, gold rose, and major cryptocurrencies edged lower. The commentary uses quotes such as 'aceptables', 'deprimido', and 'severamente' to describe inflation expectations, consumer sentiment, and market conditions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 07:47 AM\nSource:[Bolsamania](https://www.bolsamania.com/capitalbolsa/noticias/bolsa/comentario-de-apertura-a-la-espera-del-posible-cierre-del-gobierno-de-eeuusera-esta-vez-diferente--20969256.html)\n\n**Oil Companies Accuse Trump of Ending America\u2019s Golden Age: \u2018Fracking Era Is Over\u2019**\nThe article reports that U.S. oil companies, once buoyed by President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018drill\u2011baby\u2011drill\u2019 policy, are now facing a crisis. A recent Dallas Federal Reserve survey of industry executives shows that most firms feel trapped by rising costs, falling shale prices and a glut of oil. One respondent said, 'El negocio del esquisto estadounidense est\u00e1 en crisis', and another added, 'Lo que una vez fue el motor energ\u00e9tico m\u00e1s din\u00e1mico del mundo ha sido destrozado por la hostilidad pol\u00edtica y la ignorancia econ\u00f3mica'. The WTI price has dropped 10\u202f% to about $60 a barrel, the level at which a new well in the Permian Basin is barely profitable. Goldman Sachs forecasts prices of $58 in 2025 and $51 in 2026, while Randstad Energy warns that 50 platforms could shut down in 2025 if current prices persist. The article cites OPEC\u2019s rapid production increase\u20142.2\u202fmillion barrels per month\u2014projected to return 3.66\u202fmillion barrels to the market by mid\u20112026, potentially creating a 2\u202fmillion\u2011barrel\u2011per\u2011day surplus in Q4. Executives blame Trump\u2019s alignment with OPEC and tariff policies for driving prices below $40 a barrel, a level that would make drilling unviable. The piece concludes that the U.S. oil sector\u2019s future is uncertain, with investment frozen and costs rising, undermining the \u2018drill\u2011baby\u2011drill\u2019 promise.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/energia/noticias/13568571/09/25/las-petroleras-acusan-a-trump-de-acabar-con-la-era-dorada-de-eeuu-se-ha-aliado-con-la-opep-la-era-del-fracking-se-acaba.html)\n\n**Trump's tariffs could weigh on oil and gas industry's outlook, says GlobalData poll**\nThe article reports that President Trump\u2019s tariff policy, which began as a campaign promise of a 10\u201120% global import tariff and 60%+ tariffs on Chinese goods, has been rolled out with frequent changes and reversals, creating volatility and uncertainty in the oil and gas sector. Although crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum imports are largely exempt, industry analysts fear that the tariff regime could fuel inflation, slow growth and raise trade tensions, thereby putting downward pressure on oil prices. A GlobalData poll conducted from May to August 2025 surveyed 204 industry respondents. The poll found that a little over 25% of participants expected the tariff impact to last six months to one year, a slightly smaller group projected an impact of up to three years, 22% were uncertain, and 14% believed the effect could extend beyond five years. The respondents noted that the uncertainty has made planning new developments extremely challenging. The article cites the poll\u2019s diverse responses as reflecting the broader uncertainty in the US oil and gas industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:50 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The Ministry also highlighted that, following a more than 20\u202f% increase in the minimum wage (MROt) in 2026, social benefits such as sick pay, maternity leave, and vacation pay will rise.

The article cites the latest consumer price index (CPI) from the Department of Labor, noting the annual inflation rate rose to 2.9\u202f% in August from 2.7\u202f% in July, and that the food\u2011at\u2011home index increased 2.7\u202f% over the previous 12\u202fmonths. An AP\u2011NORC poll in mid\u20112025 found 53\u202f% of American adults identified grocery expenses as a major source of stress, 33\u202f% as a minor issue, and 64\u202f% of low\u2011income households cited grocery prices as a significant stressor; only 20\u202f% of households earning $100,000 or more said grocery prices were not a concern. A Gallup poll in early September reported the Economic Confidence Index at \u201320\u202f%, with 28\u202f% rating current conditions as positive and 68\u202f% saying conditions were getting worse, compared with \u201328 in September of the previous year and a low of \u201358 in June\u202f2022. The article also references a Morning Consult poll from July that found six in ten people blamed Trump for driving up the cost of living, and 70\u202f% of Republicans worried that tariffs would raise everyday prices. It includes quotes from Trump\u2019s UN General Assembly address, where he claimed he was reversing the \"economic calamity\" inherited from the previous administration, and from Moody\u2019s Chief Economist Mark\u202fZandi, who said neither Trump nor Biden was to blame for high inflation, attributing it instead to the pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine. The piece concludes with a note that the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome highlighted persistent labor\u2011market weaknesses and upside inflation risks, warning that the central bank would need to approach further rate cuts with caution.\n\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 11:31 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/women-for-trump-co-founder-blasts-outrageous-grocery-prices-10802853)\n\n**Ten indicators of what's going on with America's economy**\nTen indicators show that America\u2019s economic growth is slowing. GDP for the first quarter of 2025 shrank because tariff front\u2011running pushed goods into the U.S. before deadlines, while the second quarter rebounded strongly. Private spending and investment remain positive but have slowed sharply, and payroll figures have been revised downward. Inflation rose to 2.6% in June, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and the BLS sample for the latest figures was reduced by more than 15%. After a weak jobs report on August\u202f1, President Donald Trump said he would fire the BLS commissioner responsible, a move described as \"a remarkable act of political interference.\" Stock markets recovered to historic highs, yet the S&P\u202f500 closed the week 2.5\u202f% lower after the July\u202f31\u2011August\u202f1 tariff wave. Consumer sentiment dipped to its lowest level since mid\u20112022 following Trump\u2019s tariff announcements in April, and long\u2011term inflation expectations are at their highest in decades. Unemployment remains low, but hiring has slowed, and the Economic Policy Uncertainty index has spiked again, though slightly below April\u2019s peaks. Trump\u2019s promised $2\u202ftrillion cuts have not materialized; federal spending is running ahead of previous years. Mortgage rates averaged 6.81\u202f% in April, curbing home sales and construction, and the dollar has weakened against most major currencies since Trump took office, potentially adding to inflation. The article presents a critical view of Trump\u2019s economic policies, highlighting the challenges posed by tariffs, political interference, and fiscal uncertainty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 10:06 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/global/ten-indicators-of-what-s-going-on-with-america-s-economy-11759226549409.html)\n\n**Opening Commentary: Awaiting the Possible US Government Shutdown\u2014Will It Be Different This Time?**\nThe article reports that European stock indices closed the previous day in a mixed, largely unchanged state, with minimal price swings. The most active sectors were cyclical commodities and technology, while energy lagged due to a sharp drop in oil prices following rumors of a new OPEC+ production increase in November. Wall Street also finished with modest gains, as investors awaited negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to secure a federal funding agreement and avoid a government shutdown starting Wednesday. President Donald Trump met with congressional leaders at the White House yesterday, but the meeting yielded no significant progress. The piece notes that the U.S. government has shut down four times since 2013, typically for short periods with limited market impact, yet the current situation is more concerning because investors are anxious about the upcoming non\u2011agricultural employment report from the Department of Labor on Friday. If the shutdown occurs, the data\u2011generating departments will be closed, potentially causing a negative market reaction. In addition to the U.S. negotiations, European investors face a heavy macro\u2011economic agenda: preliminary September CPI readings in Germany and France, and Spain\u2019s inflation rate reaching its highest level in seven months. The article expects a slight uptick in inflation in Germany and France due to energy prices, but still within \"acceptable\" levels for the ECB. In the U.S., the September consumer confidence index and the August JOLTS report are scheduled for release later today; a stronger\u2011than\u2011expected JOLTS could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. The multinational NIKE (NIKE\u2011US) will also announce its quarterly results, and analysts will watch for comments on how new tariffs are affecting prices, demand, and margins. The author predicts that European indices will open mixed today, with no major attempts at market \"make\u2011up\" despite the month\u2011end and quarter\u2011end timing. The article also notes that Asian markets closed mixed, the dollar slipped slightly against major currencies, bond yields remained stable, oil prices continued to fall, gold rose, and major cryptocurrencies edged lower. The commentary uses quotes such as 'aceptables', 'deprimido', and 'severamente' to describe inflation expectations, consumer sentiment, and market conditions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 07:47 AM\nSource:[Bolsamania](https://www.bolsamania.com/capitalbolsa/noticias/bolsa/comentario-de-apertura-a-la-espera-del-posible-cierre-del-gobierno-de-eeuusera-esta-vez-diferente--20969256.html)\n\n**Will U.S. Agriculture Affect Next Midterm Elections? Farm Crisis Intensifies Electoral Uncertainty**\nThe article reports that U.S. soybean and corn futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have experienced significant volatility over the past few years. On September\u202f26, the 12\u2011month soybean contract closed at 1,013.75 cents per bushel, a 0.32\u202f% rise for the year but a 28.63\u202f% decline over three years. The 12\u2011month corn contract traded at 422 cents per bushel, down 7.96\u202f% year\u2011to\u2011date and 36.97\u202f% over three years. The CME index for the main soybean and corn contracts has been trending downward since the 2022 record highs and has returned to levels seen several years ago. \n\nU.S. exports of soybeans and corn remain important to the global market, ranking 15th and 22nd respectively in total U.S. commodity exports in 2024. In 2017, before trade tensions under the Trump administration, U.S. soybean exports were $21.53\u202fbillion (12th place) and corn exports were $9.58\u202fbillion (25th place). \n\nFarmers in the Midwest, a key agricultural region, face high production costs due to four\u2011year\u2011plus inflation and persistently low commodity prices. The article cites a warning letter from the American Soybean Association to President Trump, stating that soybean farmers are \u201con the brink of trade and economic collapse.\u201d \n\nA survey of 1,034 corn\u2011planting farmers conducted by the Agricultural Journal from August\u202f28 to September\u202f10 found that nearly half believe the U.S. is on the verge of a farm crisis; 80\u202f% think the farm economy is or is close to collapsing; and 65\u202f% report increased worry about farm operations compared with a year ago.

The study found that 56\u202f% of respondents expect 2025 holiday revenue to stay flat or grow by 10\u202f% or less, 8\u202f% anticipate a decline, and 37\u202f% forecast growth of 11\u202f% or more \u2013 half of those expecting growth anticipate more than 30\u202f%. Conservative revenue expectations are attributed to economic turbulence, including President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and inflation that cut discretionary spending, as noted in the Inmar Intelligence 2025 Holiday Forecast Report. 67\u202f% of respondents plan to keep discount levels similar to 2024, while 60\u202f% will target new customers in advertising, an 8\u2011point increase from last year. Digital and social media ads remain the top tactic (81\u202f%), followed by brand experiences (50\u202f%) and gift guides (48\u202f%). Sales\u2011channel priorities are largely unchanged: 84\u202f% will use owned e\u2011commerce sites, 69\u202f% will use social commerce, and 41\u202f% will use other retailers. Amazon usage drops to 46\u202f% from 64\u202f% in 2024, a decline of 18\u202fpercentage points, while other digital marketplaces rise by 4\u202fpercentage points.

A recent Dallas Federal Reserve survey of industry executives shows that most firms feel trapped by rising costs, falling shale prices and a glut of oil. One respondent said, 'El negocio del esquisto estadounidense est\u00e1 en crisis', and another added, 'Lo que una vez fue el motor energ\u00e9tico m\u00e1s din\u00e1mico del mundo ha sido destrozado por la hostilidad pol\u00edtica y la ignorancia econ\u00f3mica'. The WTI price has dropped 10\u202f% to about $60 a barrel, the level at which a new well in the Permian Basin is barely profitable. Goldman Sachs forecasts prices of $58 in 2025 and $51 in 2026, while Randstad Energy warns that 50 platforms could shut down in 2025 if current prices persist. The article cites OPEC\u2019s rapid production increase\u20142.2\u202fmillion barrels per month\u2014projected to return 3.66\u202fmillion barrels to the market by mid\u20112026, potentially creating a 2\u202fmillion\u2011barrel\u2011per\u2011day surplus in Q4. Executives blame Trump\u2019s alignment with OPEC and tariff policies for driving prices below $40 a barrel, a level that would make drilling unviable.

Although crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum imports are largely exempt, industry analysts fear that the tariff regime could fuel inflation, slow growth and raise trade tensions, thereby putting downward pressure on oil prices. A GlobalData poll conducted from May to August 2025 surveyed 204 industry respondents. The poll found that a little over 25% of participants expected the tariff impact to last six months to one year, a slightly smaller group projected an impact of up to three years, 22% were uncertain, and 14% believed the effect could extend beyond five years. The respondents noted that the uncertainty has made planning new developments extremely challenging.

In New\u202fJersey, the steepest increases were 25% for residential and 16% for commercial use, a spike that has become a focal point in the governor\u2019s race.  The piece attributes the surge to two structural drivers: a 30\u202fGW rise in demand from data centers out of a projected 32\u202fGW increase between 2024\u20112030, and the need to upgrade an aging transmission grid, both of which push costs into consumer bills.  Politically, former President Donald\u202fTrump\u2019s campaign promise to halve electricity prices is highlighted as unfulfilled; he blamed the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cdecoupling\u201d policies and called wind and solar a \u201ccentury scam.\u201d  The article quotes Charles\u202fHua of PowerLines, who said, '\u96fb\u50f9\u6f32\u5e45\u4f4d\u5c45\u5404\u985e\u5546\u54c1\u4e4b\u9996\uff0c\u52e2\u5fc5\u5f15\u767c\u653f\u6cbb\u98a8\u66b4,' and a dairy farmer, Eran\u202fWajswol, who complained that a 19% price jump in two months forced him to cut profit margins.  A poll from The Economist shows 50% of Americans expect prices to worsen in the next six months and 62% are dissatisfied with Trump\u2019s handling of the issue.  The narrative frames the electricity crisis as both an economic and electoral battleground, with Republicans accused of raising costs and Democrats counter\u2011attacking with clean\u2011energy ads.

The latest jobs report was a clear blow to the Republican president, showing a loss of tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs since the imposition of the tariffs in April. Trump's dismissal of the agency responsible for releasing employment data has sparked widespread controversy over the integrity of official institutions. Data on inflation has also shown a rise in consumer prices, particularly for imported goods, adding to the pressure on citizens. The country's GDP has grown at a modest annual rate of 1.3% in the first half of the year, a sharp decline from last year. Trump's economic strategy, based on tax cuts, reduced spending, and escalated trade wars, is considered a highly risky political move, especially as midterm elections approach. Experts believe that the full impact of the tariffs will not be seen until 2026, which could negatively affect Republicans in future elections. The White House sees what is happening as a 'rebalancing' phase, and that better times are ahead, but public opinion polls show a decline in public trust in Trump's economic performance. Only 38% of Americans expressed satisfaction, a decline from 50% at the end of his previous term. Trump has not spared the Federal Reserve from criticism, demanding an immediate reduction in interest rates, ignoring warnings of its impact on inflation rates. Trump supported Federal Reserve conservatives in favor of lowering interest rates, despite their differing reasons with his orientations. At the end of last year, former President Joe Biden issued a clear warning of the consequences of comprehensive tariffs, emphasizing that the American consumer -- not foreign countries -- would bear the cost. Now, the effects of this burden are clearly visible in the markets and productive sectors.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 03, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/world-news/1399974/%D8%A3%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%82%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%B0%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8)\n\n**Commentary: Trump has an energy problem  --  and it's not gasoline**\nPresident Trump's promise of cheap energy and lower inflation is being challenged by rising household energy costs, which have jumped 7.1% in the past year.

According to Reuters, Brent oil futures rose by 4 cents to $70.23 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate oil fell by 1 cent to $68.37 per barrel. The weakening of the US dollar on Asian markets supports oil prices, said OANDA's senior analyst Calvin Wong, as it makes oil cheaper for owners of other currencies. Additionally, the increase in US crude oil inventories, combined with a decrease in gasoline and distillate inventories last week, also supports oil prices, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA reported that gasoline demand increased by 6% last week to 9.2 million barrels per day. Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian exports to the US, as well as his plans to impose tariffs on copper, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, have raised concerns about inflationary pressure from Trump's tariffs.

U.S. crude oil production is projected to drop from 13.4 million barrels per day in Q2 2025 to below 13.3 million b/d by Q4 2026. The EIA blames the price forecast increase miss on overestimating U.S. oil production and underestimating demand. The report also notes that the U.S. Commerce Department has lifted export license requirements for ethane exports to China, leading to an increase in U.S. ethane exports. The article also discusses the impact of the trade war on inflation, with the author arguing that it has not significantly contributed to inflation and that President Trump's Big Beautiful Bill will lead to lower inflation. Additionally, the article notes that global diesel inventories are at the lowest level since 1996, and that the diesel crack spread has hit the highest level since the US attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The author believes that the supply squeeze is not over yet and that the market should be prepared for a surge in oil and gas demand. Natural gas prices remain low, but are expected to rise next year due to a slight production drop in 2026. Wholesale power prices are expected to increase by 12% this summer compared to last summer, contributing to higher electricity bills. The article also discusses the impact of weather on power and natural gas, with torrential rain causing catastrophic flooding in Texas, New Mexico, and North Carolina. 'The future of the US economy is going to depend on data centers and artificial intelligence, and we need to get our grid prepared.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 09, 2025 01:23 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-demand-exceeding-supply-200663418)\n\n**The Energy Report: Bullish Tensions Boiling Over | Investing.com**\nBrent crude oil prices have surged over 5% higher, reaching above $70.00 a barrel, due to bullish factors in the oil market. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a supportive weekly status report, and President Trump suggested that the US had a deal with China. However, tensions with Iran are rising, with the country opening a new uranium enrichment facility and increasing production of highly enriched fissile material. This has cast a shadow over Iran-US nuclear talks, with Senator Tom Cotton and Senator Lindsy Graham stating that Iran must completely dismantle its enrichment program to prevent a nuclear weapon. The market believes that if the talks fail, an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities may occur, which would increase the risk of oil supply disruptions. The economic backdrop is bullish for the oil market, with a tame CPI report and a positive impact from tariffs on the US economy. Fitch Rating service has a negative outlook for the oil and gas sector, but this is not supported by economic data or market prices. The EIA reported a surge in gasoline demand and a decrease in US commercial crude oil inventories. Natural gas is also surging higher due to shifting weather forecasts and increased tensions in the Middle East. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated, 'The natural gas story has been a great story...It has been a great story of lowering costs for American consumers and giving great security to our allies abroad, and growing the geopolitical influence of the United States.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 05:09 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-bullish-tensions-boiling-over-200662147)\n\n**Trump's Energy Dominance Strategy Faces Challenges as Oil Prices Decline**\nUS President Donald Trump's energy dominance strategy is facing difficulties due to the decline in oil prices and subsequent drilling activity contraction. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the US oil production is expected to decrease for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, from 1.35 million barrels per day in 2024 to 1.33 million barrels per day in 2025. This is due to the increased costs caused by Trump's trade war and the subsequent decrease in oil demand. The EIA also reported that the number of operating drilling rigs in the US has decreased, and is expected to continue to decline to 442 by 2026. The price of oil has also continued to decline, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price closing at $64.98 per barrel on June 10, a 17% decrease from its high point this year. The EIA predicts that international oil prices will fall below $60 per barrel in 2025. Trump's trade war has caused instability in the global economy, leading to a decrease in oil prices. Some analysts predict a more significant decline in oil production, with S&P Global Commodities Insights predicting a total production decrease of 640,000 barrels per day from mid-2025 to the end of 2025. This is a larger decline than some OPEC member countries. The Financial Times reported that Trump's promise to increase oil drilling and production during his presidential campaign has been officially downgraded to a pessimistic forecast just a few months later.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 02:43 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/world/11339753)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts, there is strong consensus that inflation-adjusted US gas prices are unlikely to rise in 2025. The dominant factors shaping this outlook are: (1) significant planned production increases by OPEC+, which are projected to create a global oil surplus and put downward pressure on crude oil (and thus gasoline) prices; (2) contraction in the US shale sector, which could, in isolation, support higher prices but is widely believed to be more than offset by the global supply glut; (3) a weakening US dollar and persistent, moderately above-target inflation, which could exert mild upward pressure but are generally expected to be insufficient to reverse broader supply/demand trends; (4) Trump administration tariffs and trade policies, which forecasters note are inflationary in general but largely exempt direct petroleum imports, and are more likely to dampen economic and gasoline demand than boost prices; and (5) weak consumer sentiment and soft US economic growth, further reducing the likelihood of a demand-driven price spike. Forecasters also note some non-negligible risk from potential geopolitical or weather-related supply shocks, but agree these risks are currently not acute or visible in the 2025 outlook. The historical base rate for year-on-year real gas price increases is well below 50%, typically requiring a major supply shock or global demand recovery to tip the scales\u2014neither of which is anticipated in current forecasts or data. Probability estimates for a real gas price increase range from 18% to 38%, with most experts clustering between 27% and 32% and the consensus leaning moderately to strongly against a 'Yes' outcome. All experts emphasize that barring an unforeseen shock\u2014such as a sharp OPEC+ reversal, a major geopolitical conflict, or extreme weather\u2014the most likely outcome is flat or lower inflation-adjusted US gas prices for December 2025 compared to December 2024.",
