The argument that the recent $7.69 peak already represented a near-perfect storm of short interest, ETF inclusion, and viral attention is persuasive, as is the historical observation that meme stocks typically do not repeat such rallies in quick succession.

A revised probability in the 5-7% range better reflects both the demonstrated potential for parabolic moves and the extremely low base rate for a second, larger squeeze within such a short window.

General Motors (NYSE: GM) surged over 14% on Tuesday, rising more than 19% from last week, after reporting strong earnings that exceeded consensus estimates for both revenue and profit, with an impressive full-year profit outlook. Tigress Financial Partners reaffirmed a 'strong buy' rating and raised its 12-month target price to $92, citing GM's cash flow from its leading pickup truck and SUV portfolio, which is being used to accelerate revenue growth in software and services. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) saw a sharp 200%+ weekly gain despite a post-peak drop after a prior week of decline; the surge followed the company's announcement of an early settlement with bondholders, involving new shares and bonds, which triggered a short squeeze as retail investors bought shares, further fueled by news of a distribution deal with Walmart. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) fell over 12% on Thursday after a disappointing earnings report, with weak U.S. growth and a bearish outlook signaling declining demand for HOKA and UGG brands; Bernstein Global Group analyst Anisha Sharma downgraded the target price from $100 to $85 and maintained an 'underperform' rating, citing shrinking U.S. markets and compressed profit margins for both brands. Dow (NYSE: DOW) rose about 13% on Thursday and gained approximately 12.9% from last week after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, with EPS of ($0.19), beating the analyst forecast of ($0.31) by $0.12, though revenue of $9.97 billion fell short of the consensus $10.22 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) also rose this week after announcing it was evaluating strategic options, including a potential company-wide sale or spin-offs of Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global, following indications of interest from multiple parties, including Netflix and Comcast, amid reports of a potential bidding war.

Key stock movements included: General Motors (NYSE: GM) surged over 14% on Tuesday and is projected to rise more than 19% for the week following strong earnings, exceeding consensus revenue and profit estimates, with analysts praising its guidance and cash flow from its leading light truck and SUV portfolio, as well as growth in services and programs. Tigress Financial Partners reaffirmed its 'Strong Buy' rating and raised its 12-month price target to $92. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) saw a sharp decline after a strong Monday-Wednesday rally but ended the week up over 200%, driven by a debt restructuring deal involving new shares and bonds, increased retail investor buying, and a distribution deal with Walmart Stores. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) fell over 12% on Thursday after issuing weak guidance, with Bernstein SocGen analyst Anisha Sherman citing weaker U.S. demand for HOKA and UGG brands and margin pressure, lowering the price target to $85 from $100 and maintaining a 'Underperform' rating. Dow Inc. (NYSE: DOW) rose about 13% on Thursday and 12.9% for the week on a positive earnings report, with third-quarter EPS of -$0.19, beating estimates by $0.12, though revenue of $9.97 billion missed the $10.22 billion consensus. Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) rose this week after announcing a strategic review of alternatives, including continuing its planned split into two independent media companies by mid-2026, a full company sale, or separate deals for Warner Bros. and/or Discovery globally. The stock also benefited from reports of potential bidding interest from Netflix, Comcast, and Paramount Skydance.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 07:33 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Saudi Arabia](https://sa.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-3033583)\n\n**What's Fueling the Wild Swings in Meme Stock Beyond Meat (BYND)?**\nBeyond Meat (BYND) stock surged from $0.70 to over $7.00 in six days, driven by a meme stock rally and a new distribution deal with Walmart (WMT) to sell products in over 2,000 stores nationwide, expanding access to mainstream consumers. The rally reversed sharply, with shares dropping more than 20% on Thursday to close at $2.84, though they rose over 12% in pre-market trading on Friday. Despite the volatility, the company remains unprofitable, having never posted a yearly profit and continuing to burn cash. The broader plant-based meat market has slowed, adding pressure. A short squeeze likely amplified the price surge, as heavily shorted stocks rise rapidly, forcing short sellers to cover positions. Wall Street analysts maintain a Moderate Sell consensus, with five Sells and three Holds in the past three months. The average price target of $2.20 per share implies over 22% downside from the current level, indicating that the stock\u2019s movement remains speculative rather than grounded in fundamentals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/what-s-fueling-the-wild-swings-in-meme-stock-beyond-meat-bynd-1035424821)\n\n**Beyond Meat Stock Falls. Is the Meme-Fueled Rally Over?**\nBeyond Meat shares fell after initially surging, reaching an intraday high of $7.69 earlier in the week following a series of positive announcements. On October 13, 2025, the stock traded below $1 for the first time, signaling significant market distress. However, the company rebounded after announcing on Tuesday that it was expanding distribution to over 2,000 Walmart locations in the U.S., and on Thursday revealed that upscale grocer Erewhon would carry its latest Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef products. Beyond Meat was the first pure-play company dedicated to plant-based alternative meat to go public.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The stock rose as much as 112% on Wednesday, briefly exceeding $7, but ended down 1% to close at approximately $3.60. Despite the rally, the company remains fundamentally weak, having not posted a quarterly profit in over five years and facing sluggish sales of its plant-based products. The stock is still far below its 2019 peak of over $230. Analyst Mark Hackett of Nationwide noted that the Walmart deal served as a key catalyst, potentially boosting demand, but cautioned that the surge reflects 'emotions and technicals, versus fundamentals.' The broader market context includes concerns about a potential bubble in the AI sector and regulatory scrutiny over meme stock volatility, with the SEC warning of possible market manipulation. Calls for tighter rules on short selling and social media-driven trading have emerged, but no significant regulatory action has been taken.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 06:07 PM\nSource:[bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cew4kqg09j8o)\n\n**Five Stocks Capturing Retail Investors\u2019 Attention This Week: Tesla, Beyond Meat, Rigetti, IBM, and Amazon**\nFrom October 20 to October 24, 2025, retail investors focused on five stocks\u2014Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2014amid heightened discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, driven by government shutdown speculation and AI-related enthusiasm. Tesla (TSLA) drew attention after Elon Musk threatened to resign as CEO following the rejection of his proposed $1 trillion compensation package, alongside updates on the 2026 Optimus V3 prototype, Cybercab production, robotaxi expansion in 8\u201310 U.S. cities by year-end, FSD v14 release, and a $900 million increase in AI/chip capital spending for 2025. Despite weak earnings, TSLA\u2019s stock rose 3.40% to close at $433.72 on Friday, up 14.35% year-to-date and 65.22% annually, with a 52-week range of $214.25 to $488.54. Beyond Meat (BYND) surged over 1,300% from its 52-week low, fueled by a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) distribution expansion, but fell 23.06% to close at $2.18 on Friday, down 43.25% year-to-date and 66.79% annually, with a 52-week range of $0.50 to $7.69. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) began the week bearish due to reports of U.S. government review on tech export restrictions and a Trump administration investment rumor, but reversed momentum after a report of a $10 million equity investment negotiation, though the U.S. Commerce Department denied it. RGTI closed Friday at $38.84, up 94.20% year-to-date and 2,489.33% annually, with a 52-week range of $1.06 to $58.15. IBM (IBM) gained visibility due to speculation about U.S. government investment in quantum computing firms, with analysts like Martin Shkreli and Jim Cramer favoring IBM over RGTI, IONQ, and QBTS. IBM closed Friday at $307.46, up 7.88% on the day and 39.79% year-to-date, with a 52-week range of $203.51 to $301.04. Amazon (AMZN) started the week with a major AWS outage due to DNS resolution issues, but later revealed plans to automate 75% of its U.S. business by 2033 using new Blue Jay systems, drawing criticism from Senator Bernie Sanders. Retail investors called for separating AMZN and AWS operations amid negative returns. AMZN closed Friday at $224.21, up 1.41% on the day and 1.81% year-to-date, with a 52-week range of $161.43 to $242.52.

The stock reached an intraday high of $7.69 on Wednesday, up 112.4%, but erased most gains, closing at $3.58\u2014still down over 50% from its rally peak. By Friday, shares had fallen further to $2.19 after three consecutive daily declines. Despite the rally, Beyond Meat remains far below its all-time high of $234.90 from July 2019, requiring a 9,800% increase to recover. The company has not reported an annual profit since May 2020 and continues to burn cash amid declining sales and stiff competition from Impossible Foods. Market research firm Circana reports that plant-based meats accounted for just 1% of U.S. meat sales in 2024, with declining household adoption and a $4.20 price gap between alternative and traditional meat. Wall Street remains skeptical: none of the eight analysts surveyed by FactSet are bullish, with five bearish and three neutral. Mizuho Securities analyst John Baumgartner cut his price target to $1.50, implying 37% downside. Positive catalysts include a debt-for-equity swap that improved the balance sheet (at the cost of shareholder dilution) and a Walmart partnership. However, the stock\u2019s recent surge is driven by short interest and speculative momentum, not fundamentals. As MarketWatch notes, while social media hype can fuel short-term gains, long-term success depends on strong financial performance, which Beyond Meat continues to lack.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 01:37 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20251025148/beyond-meat-is-on-a-wild-ride-why-you-should-think-twice-before-taking-a-bite)\n\n**Investing.com's Weekly Watchlist: GM Soars, Beyond Meat Surges on Short Squeeze, Deckers Falls on Weak Outlook**\nThe U.S. stock market declined on Wednesday due to investor concerns over U.S.-China trade relations, but is expected to close the week higher. General Motors (NYSE: GM) surged over 14% on Tuesday, rising more than 19% from last week, after reporting strong earnings that exceeded consensus estimates for both revenue and profit, with an impressive full-year profit outlook. Tigress Financial Partners reaffirmed a 'strong buy' rating and raised its 12-month target price to $92, citing GM's cash flow from its leading pickup truck and SUV portfolio, which is being used to accelerate revenue growth in software and services. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) saw a sharp 200%+ weekly gain despite a post-peak drop after a prior week of decline; the surge followed the company's announcement of an early settlement with bondholders, involving new shares and bonds, which triggered a short squeeze as retail investors bought shares, further fueled by news of a distribution deal with Walmart. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) fell over 12% on Thursday after a disappointing earnings report, with weak U.S. growth and a bearish outlook signaling declining demand for HOKA and UGG brands; Bernstein Global Group analyst Anisha Sharma downgraded the target price from $100 to $85 and maintained an 'underperform' rating, citing shrinking U.S. markets and compressed profit margins for both brands. Dow (NYSE: DOW) rose about 13% on Thursday and gained approximately 12.9% from last week after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, with EPS of ($0.19), beating the analyst forecast of ($0.31) by $0.12, though revenue of $9.97 billion fell short of the consensus $10.22 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) also rose this week after announcing it was evaluating strategic options, including a potential company-wide sale or spin-offs of Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global, following indications of interest from multiple parties, including Netflix and Comcast, amid reports of a potential bidding war.

Key stock movements included: General Motors (NYSE: GM) surged over 14% on Tuesday and is projected to rise more than 19% for the week following strong earnings, exceeding consensus revenue and profit estimates, with analysts praising its guidance and cash flow from its leading light truck and SUV portfolio, as well as growth in services and programs. Tigress Financial Partners reaffirmed its 'Strong Buy' rating and raised its 12-month price target to $92. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) saw a sharp decline after a strong Monday-Wednesday rally but ended the week up over 200%, driven by a debt restructuring deal involving new shares and bonds, increased retail investor buying, and a distribution deal with Walmart Stores. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) fell over 12% on Thursday after issuing weak guidance, with Bernstein SocGen analyst Anisha Sherman citing weaker U.S. demand for HOKA and UGG brands and margin pressure, lowering the price target to $85 from $100 and maintaining a 'Underperform' rating.

Beyond Meat (BYND) surged over 200% for the week after a sharp drop earlier in the week, triggered by an agreement to restructure debt via new shares and notes, which led to a short squeeze as retail investors bought in, further boosted by a distribution deal with Walmart. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) fell over 12% on Thursday after issuing weak guidance, with analysts citing declining demand for HOKA and UGG in the U.S. market.

The rally reversed sharply, with shares dropping more than 20% on Thursday to close at $2.84, though they rose over 12% in pre-market trading on Friday. Despite the volatility, the company remains unprofitable, having never posted a yearly profit and continuing to burn cash. The broader plant-based meat market has slowed, adding pressure. A short squeeze likely amplified the price surge, as heavily shorted stocks rise rapidly, forcing short sellers to cover positions. Wall Street analysts maintain a Moderate Sell consensus, with five Sells and three Holds in the past three months. The average price target of $2.20 per share implies over 22% downside from the current level, indicating that the stock\u2019s movement remains speculative rather than grounded in fundamentals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/what-s-fueling-the-wild-swings-in-meme-stock-beyond-meat-bynd-1035424821)\n\n**Beyond Meat Stock Falls.

On October 13, 2025, the stock traded below $1 for the first time, signaling significant market distress. However, the company rebounded after announcing on Tuesday that it was expanding distribution to over 2,000 Walmart locations in the U.S., and on Thursday revealed that upscale grocer Erewhon would carry its latest Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef products. Beyond Meat was the first pure-play company dedicated to plant-based alternative meat to go public.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Despite the rally, the company remains fundamentally weak: it has never posted an annual profit, revenues have declined for three consecutive years, and consumer demand for plant-based meat has waned amid a shift toward less processed diets. In September, Beyond Meat executed a debt-for-equity swap to avoid default, significantly diluting existing shareholders, and announced layoffs and the hiring of a chief transformation officer. Analysts remain skeptical, noting that while the company has liquidity to survive for about a year, a real recovery requires stable sales, successful partnerships, and a profitable business model. The global refrigerated plant-based meat market has declined by double digits annually, undermining earlier projections of a $140 billion industry. Experts suggest Beyond Meat may need a more radical reset\u2014such as share buybacks, activist investment, or product line changes\u2014to move beyond the meme-driven rally and demonstrate sustainable growth. The stock's surge is seen by many as a warning rather than a turning point.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 04:47 PM\nSource:[TheStreet](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/beyond-meat-rockets-700-percent-as-etf-hype-clashes-with-reality)\n\n**Beyond Meat Is Expanding at Walmart as a Short Squeeze Heats Up. Should You Buy BYND Stock Now?**\nBeyond Meat (BYND) stock surged 93% in Tuesday afternoon trading following its announcement of an expanded partnership with Walmart (WMT), which will bring Beyond Meat products to over 2,000 stores nationwide. The rollout includes a value-oriented 6-pack of the flagship Beyond Burger, as well as Beyond Chicken Pieces and Korean BBQ-Style Steak, targeting price-sensitive shoppers with a product offering that provides 21 grams of protein, no cholesterol, and only 2 grams of saturated fat per serving. The expansion aims to boost top-line growth and retail sell-through, potentially driving further share price gains. However, despite the rally\u2014up 350% in less than a week\u2014BYND remains a high-risk investment due to persistent cash burn, negative margins, lack of profitability, and intense competition in the plant-based meat sector. The stock\u2019s recent rise is attributed to a meme stock rally and short squeeze dynamics, which are inherently volatile and unsustainable. Wall Street firms maintain a consensus 'Moderate Sell' rating on BYND, advising caution for long-term investors until the company demonstrates sustainable earnings. According to Yahoo!

The rally was driven by multiple factors: inclusion in the Roundhill Memes ETF (MEME) by Roundhill Investments, which led to significant fund inflows, and a major partnership with Walmart. FactSet data shows that over 63% of Beyond Meat\u2019s float was sold short, creating a highly leveraged short squeeze environment. As the stock rose, short sellers were forced to cover their positions, amplifying volatility. The company\u2019s announcement that Walmart would become one of the first national retailers to carry the new Beyond Burger 6 packaging\u2014offered in an economy-sized format\u2014was a key catalyst. This expanded distribution includes Beyond Burger 6, Beyond Chicken Nuggets, and Korean BBQ-flavored Beyond Steak, with plans to roll out across more than 2,000 Walmart stores nationwide. Industry analysts highlight three advantages from the Walmart deal: market channel expansion beyond premium retailers like Whole Foods, product line diversification, and a revised pricing strategy through economy packaging to improve cost efficiency. Founded by Ethan Brown in 2009 and listed on the Nasdaq in May 2019, Beyond Meat has struggled with profitability, reporting losses in nearly every quarter since its IPO, according to Wind data.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 10:34 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8ng1yFatRJg)\n\n**How Beyond Meat\u2019s Stock Soared 600% in 72 Hours: Rally or Speculative Hype?**\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) shares surged nearly 600% over three trading days from October 17 to October 21, 2025, rising from a historical low of $0.50 to $3.62, drawing widespread attention across financial markets. The rally followed a debt-for-equity exchange that diluted shareholders by over 300%, pushing the company to record lows. The dramatic price increase raises questions about whether it reflects genuine fundamental improvement or speculative hype driven by short squeezes and social media enthusiasm. Over 63% of the float was sold short, with trading volumes exceeding 1.2 billion shares on October 21 alone\u2014characteristic of a meme stock rally rather than a shift in business fundamentals. The surge was fueled by a confluence of technical and sentiment-driven catalysts: inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF on October 20 brought institutional inflows and momentum trader interest. On October 21, the company announced expanded distribution in over 2,000 Walmart stores for its Beyond Burger 6-pack and Beyond Chicken Pieces, providing a tangible business development that coincided with the speculative surge. Market microstructure played a key role: 39.59 million shares were sold short by late September (63.13% of float), up 26.65% from the previous month, creating conditions for a violent short squeeze as pessimistic investors rushed to cover. Options activity spiked to 15 times normal volume on October 21, with 74.49% of 2.53 million contracts being calls. Borrowing costs reached triple-digit annual rates by mid-October, making short positions prohibitively expensive. Social media amplification intensified the momentum, notably from Dubai-based trader Dimitri Semenikhin (\u2018Capybara Stocks\u2019), who bought ~4% of circulating shares and promoted a bullish thesis on Reddit and YouTube, arguing the debt exchange eliminated bankruptcy risk. Despite the rally, fundamentals remain weak: in Q2 2025, revenue was $75 million\u2014nearly 20% lower than the prior year\u2014with gross margins falling from 14.7% to 11.5%, driven by declining volumes and exit from China. The company reported a net loss of $29.2 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $22.1 million, reflecting broader industry slowdown in plant-based meats across U.S. retail and international foodservice. Beyond Meat also withdrew its full-year guidance and announced a 6% workforce reduction, signaling growing pressure. Revenue dropped from $465 million in 2021 to $326 million in 2024, while its balance sheet remains strained: $1.2 billion in debt against only $103.5 million in cash. Wall Street remains skeptical: of eight analysts covering the stock, five rate it \u2018sell\u2019 or \u2018strong sell,\u2019 with a median price target of $2.27\u2014over one-third below the October 21 close of $3.62.

The stock rose as much as 112% on Wednesday, briefly exceeding $7, but ended down 1% to close at approximately $3.60. Despite the rally, the company remains fundamentally weak, having not posted a quarterly profit in over five years and facing sluggish sales of its plant-based products. The stock is still far below its 2019 peak of over $230. Analyst Mark Hackett of Nationwide noted that the Walmart deal served as a key catalyst, potentially boosting demand, but cautioned that the surge reflects 'emotions and technicals, versus fundamentals.' The broader market context includes concerns about a potential bubble in the AI sector and regulatory scrutiny over meme stock volatility, with the SEC warning of possible market manipulation.

Options activity spiked to 15 times normal volume on October 21, with 74.49% of 2.53 million contracts being call options. High borrowing costs, reaching triple-digit annual rates in mid-October, made maintaining short positions unsustainable.

The rally was primarily driven by a short squeeze triggered by a recent debt-for-equity swap, despite ongoing market skepticism and weak demand for plant-based alternatives. Financially, Beyond Meat reported $301.35 million in revenue with a three-year decline of 12.4%, operating margin of -53.04%, net margin of -50.97%, and a gross margin of 10.57%. The company\u2019s balance sheet shows strong liquidity (current ratio: 3.29, quick ratio: 2.07) but severe leverage concerns due to a negative debt-to-equity ratio of -1.9 and an Altman Z-Score of -2.57, indicating a high risk of bankruptcy within two years. Valuation metrics show a P/S ratio of 0.49, near a 10-year low, suggesting potential undervaluation, though analyst sentiment remains cautious with a hold recommendation. Institutional ownership is 44.57%, and insider ownership is 5.43%, with three insider sell transactions in the past three months. The stock\u2019s beta of 3.28 reflects high volatility, and sector risks include fluctuating consumer demand and intense competition in the consumer packaged goods industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 02:56 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3152468/beyond-meat-bynd-surges-on-expanded-walmart-partnership)\n\n**Beyond Meat stock soars after expanding Walmart distribution**\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock surged over 60% on October 21, 2025, following the company's announcement that it would expand distribution of select plant-based products to over 2,000 Walmart stores nationwide. The rally followed an 180% increase in shares over the prior three days, fueled by market speculation of a potential short squeeze. The expanded distribution includes three products: the Beyond Burger 6-Pack, Beyond Chicken Pieces, and Beyond Steak Korean BBQ-Style. According to Ethan Brown, founder and CEO of Beyond Meat, the company is 'proud to expand our distribution at Walmart' and emphasized the value pack\u2019s affordability and nutritional benefits, noting each serving delivers 21g of protein, no cholesterol, and only 2g of saturated fat from heart-healthy avocado oil. The fourth-generation Beyond Burger contains no GMOs or cholesterol, while the chicken and steak products offer 21g and 20g of protein per serving, respectively. The announcement marks a significant step in Beyond Meat\u2019s strategy to increase consumer access amid rising food prices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 01:52 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a strong consensus that Beyond Meat is highly unlikely to hit $12 a share before November 1, 2025. Experts from equity research, industry analysis, financial economics, business strategy, and consumer studies broadly agree that the company's fundamentally deteriorating financial health\u2014marked by persistent unprofitability, declining revenues, high debt, negative analyst sentiment, sector headwinds, and massive recent shareholder dilution\u2014strongly decrease the probability of such a large price surge in the short window remaining.\n\nWhile all acknowledge the possibility of meme-stock dynamics and short squeeze volatility temporarily decoupling price from fundamentals, experts point out that the October 2025 rally\u2014despite unprecedented short interest, meme hype, and technical factors\u2014peaked well below $8 and quickly faded. The majority hold that another parabolic squeeze or meme-driven run to $12 in a handful of days is extremely rare, especially as short interest is likely to have decreased with the recent squeeze, retail momentum is waning, and no new major catalysts are apparent.\n\nIndustry and market structure insights reinforce that sector demand for plant-based meat is declining, adoption has plateaued, and expanded distribution deals (such as with Walmart) are unlikely to prompt a turnaround of this magnitude, especially in such a short timeframe. The likelihood of a new viral retail campaign, a repeat or larger short squeeze, or a transformative partnership emerging within days is judged exceedingly low, though several experts assign a nonzero 'tail risk' based on meme-stock precedents like GameStop and AMC. Nevertheless, all probabilities remain well below 20%, with most clustered between 2% and 8%, reflecting a recognition that while meme-induced anomalies can occur, the combination of dire company fundamentals, recent technical exhaustion, and the very short time window sharply limit odds.\n\nIn sum, all experts forecast a low probability that Beyond Meat will hit $12 a share before the deadline, primarily due to poor fundamentals, the fading of meme dynamics, limited time for new catalysts, and historical base rates for distressed stocks. Assigned probabilities range from 2% to 15%, but cluster heavily at or below 8%.",
