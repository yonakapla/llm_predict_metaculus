Recent poll trends suggest some narrowing, but not yet at a scale, breadth, or duration to suggest an imminent crossover in the average. Outlier results (notably the CIS) inflate PSOE's hopes but are not weighted to justify reversal. Risks of sudden change (e.g., economic shock, coalition crisis, major scandal) do exist, but no clear evidence of such a game-changer is visible in current news flow.

No strong new evidence from deliberation or recent news compels me to revise upward or downward, but the deliberation validates the appropriateness of a probability in the low teens\u2014substantially below parity, but not so low as to dismiss outlier risks.",

Their reasoning emphasized three substantive points: (1) The genuine (if uncommon) plausibility of tail risks in volatile late-year Spanish politics\u2014such as rapid convergence of non-CIS polls favoring PSOE or a news-driven polling swing\u2014means base rates should be tempered by empirical caution; (2) Politico\u2019s recency weighting could amplify the effect of a run of pro-PSOE polls just before resolution, albeit unlikely, and (3) Comparable historical cases in proportional multi-party systems suggest status quo bias for the lead party should be high but rarely exceed the ~85% zone when the gap is under double digits and appears to be narrowing. While my primary arguments about party ID theory and the structure of the poll average remain solid, the critiques are convincing that the risk is understated when so close to the deadline, with evidence for sudden aggregate moves being rare but not vanishingly unlikely. Therefore, I am lowering my probability into the lower 90s to reflect these residual system risks and methodological caution.",

Multiple critiques of the extremely high-confidence (93%) position for PP reinforce that, while a dramatic flip is unlikely, there are enough tail risk factors (sudden events, polling convergence, aggregation lags) to warrant non-negligible probability, but nothing supports going notably higher than my original figure. The 'defense' arguments for more moderate, cautious probabilities\u2014and consensus about Politico\u2019s aggregation process\u2014support the sanity of my original estimate. I also see from deliberation that some forecasters argue for even lower odds (down to 4-10%), but given the recent modest narrowing and the plausible, if unlikely, compounding of pro-PSOE polls, I still see keeping the figure in the upper end of this consensus range as appropriate.

The defenses of very low probabilities (4\u20136%) as properly accounting for persistent social identity, poll-of-polls averaging, and event-driven volatility echoed my rationale. No new factor or evidence in the discussion increased the likelihood of a reversal, but I am marginally persuaded to slightly increase my estimate to account for the remote but real possibility of a final-week cluster of PSOE-leaning polls, perhaps tied to a late-breaking event or polling shift.

However, there were also defenses for slightly lower probabilities (~4-6%). Still, the main argument remains unchanged: Politico's average is robust to outliers, and given current trends, only an extraordinary, broadly-detected polling swing could flip the average in PSOE\u2019s favor.

The CIS poll shows PSOE at 32.7% and PP at 23.7%, giving the PSOE a nine\u2011point lead and indicating a shift away from the previous technical tie. In contrast, the NC Report gives PP a clear advantage with 35.2% of the vote and 156 seats, while PSOE sits at 25.8% and 104 seats. The GAD3 poll also favours PP with 32% of the vote and 137 seats, PSOE at 26.9% and 107 seats, Vox at 17.9% and 61 seats, and Sumar at only 10 seats. Carmelo Jord\u00e1\u2019s analysis in Libertad Digital highlights the volatility of the electorate and the wide dispersion of results across different polling firms, noting that parties interpret each figure to fit their communication strategy. The piece underscores that the current political landscape is marked by uncertainty, with parties like \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez\", \"Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o\", and \"Santiago Abascal\" each facing different challenges as reflected in the varying poll outcomes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 03:35 PM\nSource:[Periodista digital](https://www.periodistadigital.com/politica/20250923/claves-ultimas-encuestas-debe-preocuparse-abascal-sanchez-o-feijoo-noticia-689405135472/)\n\n**Soria and Burgos PP Parliamentarians Protest A\u201111 Highway Delays**\nSpanish parliamentarians from the Partido Popular (PP) in the provinces of Burgos and Soria met in Aranda de Duero on 23\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 to publicly accuse the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of failing to advance the A\u201111 highway. Senator Javier\u202fLacalle of Burgos cited the Langa\u202fde\u202fDuero\u2013Aranda\u202fde\u202fDuero section, where no work has been done for over a month, and said the government has already certified \u20ac11\u202fmillion of the \u20ac11\u202fmillion budgeted for 2025, warning that 'Se van a perder todos los meses que faltan hasta fin de a\u00f1o'. He asked for an additional \u20ac10\u201315\u202fmillion for the current year. Lacalle also noted that the 2025 budget of \u20ac25\u202fmillion will be insufficient to complete the remaining \u20ac150\u202fmillion of the project, which he described as 'impossible for companies to execute the last year of the 150\u202fmillion remaining, simply due to the necessary procedures and phased tenders'. He proposed reallocating \u20ac80\u202fmillion for 2026 and \u20ac90\u202fmillion for 2027 to maintain continuity. Senator Jos\u00e9\u202fManuel\u202fHernando of Soria complained that the delay is 'absolutely deliberate and conscious', citing the stalled connection between the A\u201111 and A\u201115 (La\u202fMallona\u2013Los\u202fR\u00e1banos) whose original project expired and had to be re\u2011tendered in two phases, extending the update to 24\u202fmonths with no current tender date. He also mentioned the pending connection from Los\u202fR\u00e1banos to Fuensa\u00faco and the A\u201115 segments between Villar\u202fdel\u202fCampo\u2013Agreda and Agreda\u2013Tarazona, all lacking start dates. Hernando highlighted the most critical section between Fuensa\u00faco and Villar\u202fdel\u202fCampo, where work began with a \u20ac100\u202fmillion budget but only \u20ac3.5\u202fmillion has been certified in the first of the five years planned. He called the 'technique of delay in roads' a 'true trickery' for the people of Soria.

According to the ABC\u2011GAD3 survey published on 14 September, the Partido Popular (PP) would win 137 seats in the Congress, a drop of 1.8 percentage points and 8 seats from the June 2025 poll. The PSOE would secure 107 seats, 14 fewer than in 2023. Vox could double its representation, reaching 61 seats from 33 in July 2023. Combined, the right\u2011wing bloc would hold 198 seats\u201422 above an absolute majority\u2014making a PP\u2011Vox coalition likely. Pedro Ruiz, a television presenter, comments that the polls indicate neither the government nor the opposition is hitting the mark, saying \u2018Dicen las encuestas que ni el gobierno ni la oposici\u00f3n est\u00e1n acertando\u2019.

All six polls show the Partido Popular (PP) falling, while the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE) rises in the majority of them.  The average gap between the two parties remains a high 7\u202f% (source: \"la diferencia entre ambos partidos se mantiene en un porcentaje elevado: un 7% haciendo la media de todas las encuestas\").  PP and Vox together would secure 199 seats on average\u201423 seats above the 176 needed for a simple majority in the Congress (source: \"la suma de los diputados que obtendr\u00edan PP y Vox siguen siendo una mayor\u00eda m\u00e1s que absoluta: seg\u00fan la media de los seis sondeos\u2026 llegar\u00eda a 199 diputados\").  Vox is the standout performer, with an average vote share of 16.3\u202f% and an average rise of 1.7\u202f% across the polls (source: \"los de Santiago Abascal suben en todas y cada una de las encuestas y la media de esta subida es de un 1,7%\u2026 el partido a la derecha del PP estar\u00eda en un 16,3% del voto\").  The piece also comments that PSOE\u2019s gains are modest and still below pre\u2011corruption\u2011scandal levels, while PP\u2019s decline is consistent and may erode its support base.  It concludes that both parties should reassess strategies, especially PP, which risks a precarious position if the trend continues (source: \"los populares est\u00e1n retrocediendo y\u2026 los de Feij\u00f3o tienen que tener claro que de seguir esta sangr\u00eda\u2026 pueden llegar a una situaci\u00f3n muy complicada\").\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 04:24 AM\nSource:[Libertad Digital](https://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/politica/2025-09-23/las-claves-de-las-ultimas-encuestas-donde-deben-estar-mas-preocupados-en-ferraz-o-en-genova-7298929/)\n\n**The Myth of 35\u202f%: An Analysis by Iv\u00e1n\u202fRedondo**\nThe article, written by Iv\u00e1n\u202fRedondo, argues that the widely cited \"35\u202f% myth\"\u2014the idea that the Spanish left can secure a 35\u202f% share of the vote\u2014has no basis in current electoral realities. Redondo cites several metrics to support his claim. He notes that the left\u2019s realistic ceiling is between 39\u202f% and 42\u202f% depending on right\u2011wing performance, and that the PP cannot realistically reach 35\u202f% because the two main paths to that figure\u2014either a clean split with the PSOE or a coalition with the right\u2011wing base\u2014are mutually exclusive. He also points out that the 2024 general election will likely see a turnout similar to 2015 (around 70\u202f%) and that the 23\u2011J election had 700\u202f000 fewer voters than 2015, underscoring a decline in left\u2011wing mobilization.\n\nRedondo quotes the headline, 'El mito del 35% de voto socialista o popular es vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n,' to emphasize his point. He further explains that the left\u2019s best chance to reach 35\u202f% would require a strategy akin to the 2008 Zapatero model, which he deems a \"craso error.\" He also references the 2022 Andalusian elections, where the PP gained 20\u202f000 votes, and the 2023 polls that show the PP could only reach 35\u202f% through incompatible routes.\n\nThe piece concludes that the myth of 35\u202f% is outdated and that the left must focus on realistic targets, while the PP\u2019s prospects are limited by structural constraints. The article is heavily opinionated, presenting a clear political bias in favor of a left\u2011leaning perspective.\n\nEvidence:\n- 35\u202f% myth is dismissed as \"vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n\".\n- Left\u2019s realistic ceiling: 39\u201142\u202f%.\n- PP cannot reach 35\u202f% via two incompatible paths.\n- 2024 turnout likely ~70\u202f% (like 2015).\n- 23\u2011J had 700\u202f000 fewer voters than 2015.\n- 2022 Andalusian PP gained 20\u202f000 votes.\n- Quote: 'El mito del 35% de voto socialista o popular es vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[lavanguardia.com](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20250922/11082617/mito-35.html)\n\n**Barcelona Council Survey Highlights PSC Lead and Fragmented Opposition**\nThe survey released by GESOP during the Merc\u00e8 festivities shows the Socialists (PSC) consolidating a lead in Barcelona\u2019s city council, with the party\u2019s mayor, Jaume Collboni, gaining one or two seats.  The opposition remains fragmented, with the most affected group, Junts, projected to drop from 11 to 7 councillors.  PSC\u2019s deputy mayor, Laia Bonet, praised the public\u2019s appreciation of the party\u2019s ability to reach agreements, noting that \"the formations that improved results were those that had a willingness to dialogue,\" referring to ERC.  The survey also highlights a \"very fragmented\" council, citing the high number of undecided voters and the potential entry of Alian\u00e7a Catalana, which would add two seats, and Vox, which would add one.  Junts\u2019 leader, Jordi Mart\u00ed, expressed doubt about the forecast, saying \"the 2027 election verdict will have nothing to do with it\" and that Collboni will lose \"never won them.\"  The survey revealed a split between BCom\u00fa and ERC over a left\u2011wing candidacy for 2027: BCom\u00fa, concerned about the rise of the far right, is open to a broad left\u2011wing coalition, with its leader Janet Sanz calling it \"a very good recipe,\" while ERC\u2019s Elisenda Alamany firmly rejected the idea, stating \"it is not an option that is on the table.\"  The PP\u2019s Daniel Sirera highlighted his strong name recognition, claiming \"we are on the right line,\" and the Vox president Gonzalo de Oro noted his group\u2019s growing vote share, though he urged caution in interpreting the polls.

He asked for an additional \u20ac10\u201315\u202fmillion for the current year. Lacalle also noted that the 2025 budget of \u20ac25\u202fmillion will be insufficient to complete the remaining \u20ac150\u202fmillion of the project, which he described as 'impossible for companies to execute the last year of the 150\u202fmillion remaining, simply due to the necessary procedures and phased tenders'. He proposed reallocating \u20ac80\u202fmillion for 2026 and \u20ac90\u202fmillion for 2027 to maintain continuity. Senator Jos\u00e9\u202fManuel\u202fHernando of Soria complained that the delay is 'absolutely deliberate and conscious', citing the stalled connection between the A\u201111 and A\u201115 (La\u202fMallona\u2013Los\u202fR\u00e1banos) whose original project expired and had to be re\u2011tendered in two phases, extending the update to 24\u202fmonths with no current tender date.

Jes\u00fas Morales, the party's spokesperson, said, 'Nos da igual que las elecciones sean en 2026 o 2027, estamos preparados', indicating readiness for elections in either year.  Morales accuses Aragonese President Jorge Azc\u00f3n of adopting Vox\u2019s platform across the region, claiming he 'beneficia a unos pocos y perjudica a la gran mayor\u00eda de los aragoneses'.  He also criticises the mayor of Quinto, Natalia Chueca, who called Azc\u00f3n 'el gran presidente ausente'.  The PSOE plans regional events in the three provinces to rally supporters.  Morales disputes the claim that the Spanish government will inject \u20ac2\u202fmillion into the Montmel\u00f3 circuit, arguing that the Aragonese Motorland circuit already received a \u20ac10\u202fmillion investment from the Teruel Investment Fund (Fite) for infrastructure upgrades.  He states, 'Es falso que Motorland no reciba inversi\u00f3n estatal', and notes that the Aragonese government has not requested any sports subsidies.  In response, Tomasa Hern\u00e1ndez, the regional minister, defended the \u20ac16\u202fmillion decree, noting that \u20ac5.8\u202fmillion (over 34\u202f%) was earmarked for Catalan projects that were pre\u2011selected without a competitive process.

Redondo cites several metrics to support his claim. He notes that the left\u2019s realistic ceiling is between 39\u202f% and 42\u202f% depending on right\u2011wing performance, and that the PP cannot realistically reach 35\u202f% because the two main paths to that figure\u2014either a clean split with the PSOE or a coalition with the right\u2011wing base\u2014are mutually exclusive. He also points out that the 2024 general election will likely see a turnout similar to 2015 (around 70\u202f%) and that the 23\u2011J election had 700\u202f000 fewer voters than 2015, underscoring a decline in left\u2011wing mobilization.\n\nRedondo quotes the headline, 'El mito del 35% de voto socialista o popular es vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n,' to emphasize his point. He further explains that the left\u2019s best chance to reach 35\u202f% would require a strategy akin to the 2008 Zapatero model, which he deems a \"craso error.\" He also references the 2022 Andalusian elections, where the PP gained 20\u202f000 votes, and the 2023 polls that show the PP could only reach 35\u202f% through incompatible routes.\n\nThe piece concludes that the myth of 35\u202f% is outdated and that the left must focus on realistic targets, while the PP\u2019s prospects are limited by structural constraints. The article is heavily opinionated, presenting a clear political bias in favor of a left\u2011leaning perspective.\n\nEvidence:\n- 35\u202f% myth is dismissed as \"vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n\".\n- Left\u2019s realistic ceiling: 39\u201142\u202f%.\n- PP cannot reach 35\u202f% via two incompatible paths.\n- 2024 turnout likely ~70\u202f% (like 2015).\n- 23\u2011J had 700\u202f000 fewer voters than 2015.\n- 2022 Andalusian PP gained 20\u202f000 votes.\n- Quote: 'El mito del 35% de voto socialista o popular es vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[lavanguardia.com](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20250922/11082617/mito-35.html)\n\n**PP Stagnates, Left Falls, Vox Surges Past 60 Seats**\nAccording to a GAD3 poll for ABC, if general elections were held now, the Partido Popular (PP) would win 137 seats, representing 32\u202f% of the vote\u2014exactly the same result as in July\u202f2023.

In Madrid, PP would stay ahead with 23.7%, but PSOE and Vox would reach 20.2% and 17.7% respectively. Nationalist parties would dominate the Basque Country (38%) and Catalonia (25%).

According to a July survey conducted by the Instituto DYM for HENNEO, if general elections were held today, the Socialist Party (PSOE) would receive 26.1% of the votes, the same percentage as last month, and more than five and a half points below their 2023 result. The People's Party (PP) would win a comfortable victory with 36.1% of the votes, a tenth more than in June, allowing them to govern alongside Vox, which continues to rise (14.6%).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 17, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[HERALDO](https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2025/07/17/barometro-julio-dym-henneo-intencion-voto-pp-psoe-vox-1840061.html)\n\n**PSOE Maintains Lead in July CIS Poll, but Gap with PP Narrows**\nThe Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) maintains its position as the first choice in voting intention in July, according to the latest survey by the Center for Sociological Research (CIS), but significantly reduces its advantage over the People's Party (PP) to almost a half-point difference. The CIS Barometer of Opinion in July keeps the PSOE as the first force with a 27% estimate of vote, compared to 26.5% for the PP, leaving a difference of just half a percentage point between the two. The party led by Feij\u00f3o appears ahead of the PSOE in direct voting intention (also known as 'uncooked vote'), where 18.8% of those interviewed said they would vote for the PP, while 18.3% advanced their intention to vote for the socialists. 'The PSOE maintains its position, but the gap with the PP has narrowed significantly,' said the CIS. 'This is a significant change in the electoral landscape,' added the center. 'The PSOE's advantage over the PP has been reduced to almost a half-point difference, which is a significant change in the electoral landscape,' said the CIS.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 11:42 AM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/economia/politica/2025/07/11/6870f402e5fdea7d6e8b457f.html)\n\n**Spanish Elections: PP Leads with 6.5-Point Advantage over PSOE**\nThe Spanish government, led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is facing a period of extreme weakness after the corruption scandal that led to the resignation of Santos Cerd\u00e1n, the secretary of organization of the PSOE. The coalition is starting to unravel due to the distrust of its partners, but none of them are willing to support a motion of censure with the PP and Vox. However, the possibility of an early election is no longer considered impossible, and Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the leader of the PP, is navigating with a very favorable wind, rekindled by the strong erosion of the socialists. According to the average of the main polls published in 2025, the PP is in first place with a 6.5-point advantage over the PSOE, which means that the gap has widened by two points in the last six months. The PP would obtain 34.1% of the votes and the PSOE would get 27.6%, with Vox growing in strength and Sumar declining. The calculations made by EL PERI\u00d3DICO, based on a formula used by Ivan Serrano, researcher at the IN3 of the UOC, correspond to the weighted average of the main polls published. The weighting is done in function of the size of the sample (the larger, the higher the value) and the date of the fieldwork (the more recent, the more significant). It is worth noting that some polls, such as those of the CIS, only offer estimates of votes, but not of seats, which affects the averages of each variable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 04, 2025 04:03 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20250704/encuestas-elecciones-generales-espana-sondeos-12274406)\n\n**PSOE Suffers Significant Decline in Support, PP Gains Ground**\nA recent poll by Sigma Dos for EL MUNDO shows a significant decline in support for the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez, with a 4.9-point drop in intention to vote to 26.8%. This is the party's lowest score since the 2023 general elections. The People's Party (PP) has gained 1.6 points, putting them 8 points ahead of the PSOE, with a potential 41-seat advantage if elections were held today. The PP's leader, Feij\u00f3o, could become president of the government with the support of Vox, but the transfer of votes from the PP to Vox is a concern, with the PP losing over 1 million votes to Vox. The poll also shows a decline in support for Sumar, the coalition led by Yolanda D\u00edaz, with a 7.5% intention to vote, down from 10.4% in the 2023 general elections. Podemos has also lost support, with a 4.5% intention to vote, down from 6.3% in the 2023 general elections. The poll suggests that the PSOE's decline is due to the corruption scandal surrounding the government, as well as dissatisfaction with S\u00e1nchez's leadership and performance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 09:10 PM\nSource:[EL MUNDO](https://www.elmundo.es/espana/encuestas/2025/06/29/686184d0fdddffed208b458d.html)\n\n**PP Leads in Recent Polls Amid PSOE Crisis**\nRecent polls show that the PP (People's Party) would win the elections with a significant lead over the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party), which is struggling due to an internal crisis. According to the T. Point poll, the PP would win with 33.5% of the votes, securing 145 seats, while the PSOE would come in second with 28.1% of the votes and 119 seats. Vox would come in third with 14.3% of the votes and 43 seats. These results suggest that the right-wing parties could form a coalition to make Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o the president of the government. The other parties, such as Sumar and Podemos, would suffer significant losses, with Sumar losing 10 seats and Podemos failing to reach the 5% threshold. The polls are consistent across different surveys, with the PP leading the PSOE by a significant margin.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 22, 2025 08:41 AM\nSource:[El Plural](https://www.elplural.com/politica/espana/encuestas-informe-cerdan-feijoo-abascal-imponen-psoe-minimos_354901102)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the consensus is that the probability of PSOE finishing 2025 ahead of PP in Politico\u2019s Poll of Polls average is low. As of late September 2025, PP leads PSOE by approximately 6\u20137 points in the aggregate average, and this gap has persisted throughout the year. Most experts note that abrupt reversals of leads of this magnitude are extremely rare outside of election years or absent a major triggering event (such as a political scandal, government crisis, or acute economic shock). Some recent polls, particularly from the CIS (which is widely regarded as systematically pro-PSOE), show narrowing or even a lead for PSOE, but these are considered outliers and have limited effect on Politico's weighted average, which tends to smooth out such anomalies.\n\nFactors cited as decreasing the likelihood of a PSOE lead include: historical base rates of polling inertia, the structural entrenchment of party identification and social cleavages, the lack of a scheduled general election, and persistent fragmentation within the left that prevents rapid consolidation of support. A modest increase in PSOE\u2019s chances is attributed to recent signs of tightening polls\u2014polls from some firms (like 40db) show a smaller gap; additionally, PP\u2019s potential vulnerability to Vox siphoning votes offers a limited upside scenario for PSOE if combined with a major exogenous shock. However, structural and methodological factors\u2014such as the broad consensus of private pollsters and the aggregation methods used by Politico\u2014make it highly unlikely for PSOE to overtake PP within the three-month window left in 2025.\n\nAll experts agree that only a significant, broadly recognized event (e.g. a scandal hitting PP or a major policy victory for PSOE, with reflected convergence across several major polling houses) could plausibly flip the order. The likelihoods assigned by the experts range from 4% to 18%, with the vast majority clustering around 10\u201315% for a 'Yes' resolution, and one outlier (Party ID Theory) giving 93% for 'No.' In sum, the experts' forecasts strongly favor PP retaining its lead in the poll average through the end of 2025, with only a small chance of an upset by PSOE, contingent on rare, high-impact developments.",
