The 2025 exclusion is arguably even more comprehensive than 2015, as both Gbagbo and Thiam are barred and opposition is fractured. The remaining candidates\u2014Simone Gbagbo (no current mass base), Billon, Don-Mello, Lagou\u2014are not major threats either individually or collectively, and have not galvanized any mass support or international attention. The regime has also shown no compunction about inflating outcomes far above plausible pluralities. Given all that, the base rate for a semi-authoritarian incumbent in this context comfortably exceeds 80%. The only moderating factors are regime caution (to avoid repeating the optics of a 94% win, and instead keep to a 'respectable' 79%), or slightly greater space for protest/invalid votes.

Previous elections (2015, 2020) in similar, though not quite so constrained, contexts produced 84% and 94% for Ouattara, demonstrating that even with some competitors on the ballot, inflated margins are likely when institutions are captured and opposition is not viable. While the existence of four other candidates nominally creates competition, they lack legitimacy, party machinery, or broad public visibility. The government tightly controls result tabulation, and would likely prefer a result over 80% to demonstrate overwhelming support and deter dissent, especially considering the official narrative after suppressing credible challengers. Short of a truly massive anti-government turnout (unlikely given the calls for passive resistance, not protest voting), or the regime opting for a less ostentatious margin to avoid international outcry, the odds favor a reported 80%+ for Ouattara.

Given the near-complete institutional control exercised by Ouattara\u2014Constitutional Court, electoral commission, security services\u2014there is ample opportunity for both discouraging turnout and for reporting whatever result is desired, with the lower bound being something in the 80-90% range.

In 2015, with a more competitive field, he received 83.7% of the vote.

While the presence of four other candidates appears to provide choice, none have credible capacity or support base to mobilize protest votes beyond symbolic levels. The regime's pattern (as in 2020) suggests a tendency to report overwhelming victory margins to project stability and control. Abstention by opposition supporters, rather than translating into an anti-regime vote, only inflates Ouattara's percentage among actual voters. The only significant uncertainties are: whether the regime will opt for a 'lower' landslide for international optics, and whether turnout will be engineered sufficiently high to allow for an overwhelming majority. Nonetheless, the base rate for African elections with restricted competition and highly managed outcomes is well above 80%. Several plausible, but not dominant, scenarios could drop him just under the threshold\u2014such as a protest surge for an allowed candidate or regime optics management\u2014but these are low-probability.

In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the severe exclusion of credible challengers has so eroded both domestic and foreign legitimacy that the cost-benefit calculation for Ouattara's administration skews toward maximizing the apparent support, even at the risk of credibility. Past elections showed little responsiveness to external criticism, with negligible impact on medium-term regime security. Additionally, there is no recent evidence that the government cares to remain at the edge of the 'plausible' zone; the regime's actions in 2020 suggest little restraint, as the official total far surpassed the symbolic 80% line.

In highly managed elections like C\u00f4te d'Ivoire 2025, the decisive factor is not simply voter abstention among ethnic opposition blocs, but the regime's ability and willingness to report results that serve its legitimacy needs, regardless of actual abstention or protest voting rates. This means that even widespread abstention or spoiled ballots would likely be underreported in official statistics, further boosting Ouattara's share above 80%.

This has implications for the degree to which reported turnout can be plausibly inflated and the share of valid votes for each candidate. Previous elections have shown that high abstention by key groups can sometimes force the regime to moderate overly ambitious margins for the sake of post-election stability, even if the result is still overwhelming.

Historical precedent (2020's much higher margin, even under heavy criticism) and the prevailing social order suggest the regime feels little pressure from either international or domestic audiences to self-limit its victory.

Critiques of more cautious estimates also persuaded me that the residual risk from regime moderation or protest voting is, in practice, marginal unless there is a dramatic and currently unanticipated event. Therefore, I am increasing my probability to 91%.",

The Council had shortlisted five candidates out of 60, including incumbent president Alassane Ouattara, Jean\u2011Louis Billon and Simone Ehivet, the ex\u2011wife of Gbagbo. Gbagbo, who is ineligible, saw his own candidacy rejected on 8\u202fSeptember. According to his spokesperson, Ma\u00eetre\u202fHabiba\u202fTour\u00e9, the selected candidates are not backed by the country\u2019s major parties, so there is no consensus or legitimacy for a unified strategy. Gbagbo therefore plans to pursue \u201cpeaceful and democratic actions\u201d to oppose a fourth term for Ouattara, while rejecting any challenge to the institutions. He argues that validating a fourth term and excluding 55 candidates\u2014including those from major opposition parties\u2014has violated the principle of equality before the law. The government\u2019s spokesperson, Amadou\u202fCoulibaly, reiterated that the Constitutional Council\u2019s decisions are final and that contesting them would be a legal violation. The article cites the following quotes: 'Il faut le dire clairement : les candidats retenus par le Conseil constitutionnel ne sont pas ceux investis par les grands partis politiques du pays.

The campaign will run from 18 September to 8 October 2025 and seeks to mobilise the 20 departments that make up the V baoul\u00e9, covering seven regions including B\u00e9lier, Iffou, N\u2019Zi and the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro. Founded on 7 December 2024 in Abidjan, the movement presents itself as a citizen platform that transcends partisan divides. It highlights Ouattara\u2019s ongoing development work, noting that \u2018pr\u00e8s de 3000 villages sont \u00e9lectrifi\u00e9s, des routes sont entretenues, des centres de sant\u00e9 et des \u00e9coles construits\u2019. The campaign counters opposition slogans \u2018Trop c\u2019est trop\u2019 with the rallying cry \u2018\u00c7a suffit\u2019 and calls on the central\u2011region population to support continued development. The election is scheduled for 25 October 2025, with the movement aiming for an \u2018\u00e9clatante\u2019 victory for Ouattara in the V baoul\u00e9.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 10:41 PM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/presidentielle-en-cote-d-ivoire-2025-ewan-ado-sur-le-terrain-pour-la-victoire-d-alassane-ouattara)\n\n**Ivory Coast: Eligibility of President Alassane Ouattara in 2020 and 2025**\nThe article explains that the debate over President Alassane Ouattara\u2019s eligibility for the 2025 presidential election has resurfaced, just as it did in 2020. It states that every candidate, including Ouattara, was examined by the Constitutional Council solely on the basis of the 2016 Ivorian Constitution and its derived texts (organic law, electoral code, complementary laws). The Council\u2019s decisions consistently reference the 2016 Constitution, saying, 'Vu la Constitution de 2016, vu la loi organique, vu le code \u00e9lectoral, vu la loi, vu le d\u00e9cret\u2026' (Evidence). To invalidate Ouattara\u2019s candidacy, one would have had to apply a different legal corpus, namely the 2000 Constitution, which the article argues is no longer legally valid: 'La Constitution de 2000 n\u2019a plus de valeur juridique et n\u2019est opposable \u00e0 personne.' (Evidence). The 2016 Constitution\u2019s Article\u202f183 guarantees institutional continuity but does not allow retroactive application of repealed provisions; Article\u202f55 incorporates a clause from Article\u202f35 of the 2000 Constitution only within the new constitutional framework. Thus, applying the 2000 Constitution to bar Ouattara would create an exceptional legal order. The article notes that the establishment of the Third Republic in 2016 introduced new eligibility conditions (ending age limits, creating a vice\u2011presidency) and effectively started a new constitutional cycle. The Constitutional Council validated Ouattara\u2019s candidacy in 2020 by treating the mandate count as starting from zero under the new republic, and the same reasoning applies to 2025, where the debate has not even been raised. The piece concludes that the controversy is less about positive law and more about political interpretations, as even opponents admit that an early election between 2016 and 2020 could have allowed Ouattara to run, implicitly recognizing the 2016 framework\u2019s reset of mandate counting.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 02:17 PM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/cote-divoire-de-leligibilite-du-president-alassane-ouattara-en-2020-et-2025)\n\n**Ouattara Confirms Candidacy for Fourth Term Amid Tension in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire**\nPresident Alassane Ouattara, 83, officially announced his candidacy for a fourth term in the 25 October 2025 presidential election, citing the need to confront unprecedented security, economic and monetary challenges. The announcement comes amid a fragile political climate, with key opposition leaders absent or in exile, strengthening Ouattara\u2019s position as the favored candidate. The decision raises concerns about national stability, echoing fears of a potential coup, especially after the 2021 military overthrow of Guinea\u2019s President Alpha Cond\u00e9, who had also sought a third term. The upcoming election is therefore seen as a critical test for Ivorian democracy and West\u2011African governance, where constitutional norms and popular demands for political alternation remain central issues.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 08:48 PM\nSource:[aminata.com](https://aminata.com/ouattara-confirme-sa-candidature-pour-un-4e-mandat-vers-une-cote-divoire-sous-tension/)\n\n**Ivory Coast polls: Laurent Gbagbo vows not to support any other candidate**\nFormer Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo has declared that he will not endorse any candidate in the upcoming presidential election, despite being declared ineligible to run.  Gbagbo stated that he will not support any of the candidates approved by the Constitutional Council, citing a lack of consensus and legitimacy among them.  His party spokesperson, Me Habiba Tour\u00e9, echoed this position, saying the candidates do not represent the larger political parties in the country.  Gbagbo, who has consistently opposed President Alassane Ouattara\u2019s bid for a fourth term, calls the situation a violation of constitutional law, noting that the Ivorian constitution limits presidents to two terms but the Council argues a 2016 constitution reset the term counter.  The article notes that political tensions are escalating as Gbagbo and opposition leader Tidjane Thiam are ineligible to participate due to legal and nationality issues.  Among the five qualified candidates is incumbent President Ouattara, along with others once allied with Gbagbo.  Gbagbo has called for 'democratic and peaceful actions' to contest Ouattara\u2019s fourth term, while government spokesperson Amadou Coulibaly warned that any challenges to the Constitutional Council\u2019s decisions would face legal consequences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[Africanews](https://www.africanews.com/2025/09/19/ivory-coast-polls-laurent-gbagbo-vows-not-to-support-any-other-candidate/)\n\n**Ivorian Presidential Election: Laurent Gbagbo Declares He Will Not Support Any Opposition Candidate**\nFormer Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo, declared ineligible by a court, announced on 18\u202fSeptember that he would not support any candidate in the upcoming 25\u202fOctober presidential election. He reiterated his opposition to a fourth term for incumbent Alassane Ouattara, who has been in power since 2011. Gbagbo said he had considered backing 'l'un des candidats retenus' but found no consensus or sufficient legitimacy for such a strategy. The Constitutional Council had already rejected the candidacies of Gbagbo and Tidjane\u202fThiam earlier in September, citing judicial decisions that render them ineligible. The election will feature five qualified candidates: Ouattara, former wife Simone\u202fEhivet, ex\u2011minister Ahoua Don\u202fMello, dissident minister Jean\u2011Louis Billon, and Henriette\u202fLagou.

The International Monetary Fund projects the country will approach the upper\u2011middle\u2011income threshold in the medium term, and rating agencies Standard\u202f&\u202fPoor\u2019s, Fitch and Moody\u2019s have upgraded the country to be among Africa\u2019s best after Botswana, Mauritius and Morocco. The average annual growth rate from 2012 to 2023 was 6.9\u202f%, surpassing crises such as the COVID\u201119 pandemic and the post\u20112010 election violence. Infrastructure has expanded with new ports in San\u202fPedro and Abidjan, bridges, roads and stadiums, and the country hosted the 2024 Africa Cup of Nations. Electricity access rose from 55.8\u202f% in 2012 to 72.4\u202f% in 2023, while renewable energy now accounts for 30\u202f% of the mix, making the country\u2019s tariffs the cheapest in the region. Mobile\u2011phone penetration and mobile\u2011payment services grew, although the sector was hit in 2024 when four of five submarine cables were cut. Abidjan attracted billions of AF\u202ffrancs in investment from Moroccan, Singaporean, French and Senegalese firms, and companies from Mali and Burkina Faso moved to the country for a more stable environment. Oil and gas production began with the Balin field in August\u202f2023. Public debt climbed from 24.6\u202f% of GDP in 2012 to 58.1\u202f% in 2025, but rating agencies consider it manageable because the deficit fell to 4\u202f% in 2024. Poverty fell from 55\u202f% in 2011 to 37.5\u202f% in 2021, yet rural inequalities persist and the informal sector still represents 40\u202f% of GDP and 80\u202f% of jobs. The Transparency International index rose from 35/100 in 2019 to 45/100 in 2024, but remains below leading African countries. Agriculture remains the world\u2019s largest producer of cocoa and cashew, with progress in local manufacturing, yet climate change, supply\u2011chain disruptions and the need to import half of rice continue to challenge the sector. Africa Report concludes that Ouattara\u2019s economic legacy combines clear growth and investment gains with shortcomings in reducing inequalities and achieving balanced social development.

According to the Council\u2019s president, Chantal Nanaba Camara, the selected candidates\u2014Alassane Ouattara, former Commerce Minister Jean\u2011Louis Billon, former Minister Ahoua Don\u2011Mello Jacob, former First Lady Simone Ehivet Gbagbo, and Henriette Lagou, who ran in 2015\u2014are the only ones who met the eligibility requirements set out in Article 55 of the Constitution and Article 48 of the electoral code. The Council received roughly 60 applications from the Independent Electoral Commission. The campaign will run from 10 to 23 October, with 11,906 polling stations: 11,835 inside C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and 71 abroad, totaling 25,678 booths (25,370 nationally and 308 overseas). The election is seen as a pivotal moment for the country\u2019s political future amid a generational transition and shifting political actors. Past elections have often been marred by tensions and violence, so the 2025 contest aims to ensure a peaceful and transparent process to avoid a post\u2011electoral crisis.

It states that every candidate, including Ouattara, was examined by the Constitutional Council solely on the basis of the 2016 Ivorian Constitution and its derived texts (organic law, electoral code, complementary laws). The Council\u2019s decisions consistently reference the 2016 Constitution, saying, 'Vu la Constitution de 2016, vu la loi organique, vu le code \u00e9lectoral, vu la loi, vu le d\u00e9cret\u2026' (Evidence). To invalidate Ouattara\u2019s candidacy, one would have had to apply a different legal corpus, namely the 2000 Constitution, which the article argues is no longer legally valid: 'La Constitution de 2000 n\u2019a plus de valeur juridique et n\u2019est opposable \u00e0 personne.' (Evidence). The 2016 Constitution\u2019s Article\u202f183 guarantees institutional continuity but does not allow retroactive application of repealed provisions; Article\u202f55 incorporates a clause from Article\u202f35 of the 2000 Constitution only within the new constitutional framework. Thus, applying the 2000 Constitution to bar Ouattara would create an exceptional legal order. The article notes that the establishment of the Third Republic in 2016 introduced new eligibility conditions (ending age limits, creating a vice\u2011presidency) and effectively started a new constitutional cycle. The Constitutional Council validated Ouattara\u2019s candidacy in 2020 by treating the mandate count as starting from zero under the new republic, and the same reasoning applies to 2025, where the debate has not even been raised. The piece concludes that the controversy is less about positive law and more about political interpretations, as even opponents admit that an early election between 2016 and 2020 could have allowed Ouattara to run, implicitly recognizing the 2016 framework\u2019s reset of mandate counting.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 02:17 PM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/cote-divoire-de-leligibilite-du-president-alassane-ouattara-en-2020-et-2025)\n\n**RHDP Membership Surge in Grand\u2011Ponts Attributed to Minister Silas Metch**\nOn Saturday 6 September 2025, a new wave of memberships in the Rassemblement des Houphou\u00ebtistes pour la D\u00e9mocratie et la Paix (RHDP) was recorded in the Grand\u2011Ponts region. According to a note, several opposition militants, all registered on electoral lists, officially joined the ruling party. The move is said to be driven by attraction to President Alassane Ouattara's vision and by the on\u2011the\u2011ground actions of Minister Silas Metch. New members expressed support for the RHDP's values of 'stability, development and future'. Minister Metch, presented as a key actor in Ivorian sports victories and as a representative of the Grand\u2011Ponts populations, has been conducting a series of meetings in the area for several weeks. His supporters portray his work as a vehicle for reconciliation and social cohesion. The growth of RHDP cadres in this 'sensitive' region is described as 'steady and continuous' in both urban and rural settings. This momentum comes amid preparations for the October 2025 presidential election. Locally, the RHDP is coordinated by Vincent Lohou\u00e8s, minister\u2011governor of the Lagunes autonomous district, who relies on territorial anchors like Metch to consolidate the party's base. The spokesperson for the new members praised 'the groundwork laid by the President' and 'the remarkable efforts of Minister Silas Metch for development and cohesion in the region'.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 11:50 AM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/adhesions-au-rhdp-dans-les-grands-ponts-une-dynamique-attribuee-a-laction-du-ministre-silas-metch)\n\n**Simone Gbagbo\u2019s Candidacy Validated \u2013 Will the Former First\u2011Lady Re\u2011enter Ivory Coast\u2019s Political Spotlight?**\nSimone Gbagbo, 76, former first\u2011lady of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, has been approved by the Constitutional Council as one of five candidates for the presidential election on 25\u202fOctober. She will run against incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, 83, who seized power after the 2010 post\u2011election crisis. Former president Laurent Gbagbo, former prime minister Pascal Affi N\u2019Guessan and former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam were disqualified, raising doubts about the vote\u2019s legitimacy. Thiam called the decision an \u2018acte de vandalisme d\u00e9mocratique\u2019 and accused Ouattara of orchestrating a \u2018\u00e9lection truqu\u00e9e\u2019. Ouattara won the 2020 election with a landslide after a 2016 constitutional amendment allowed him to run again; the vote was boycotted by the opposition and 85 people were killed in the ensuing unrest. Laurent Gbagbo was barred from running because of a 2018 conviction for looting the central bank; he was later amnestied in 2020 but remains ineligible to run. Simone Gbagbo, who was sentenced to 20\u202fyears in 2015 and later amnestied, has rebuilt a political base after leaving the FPI. Only 30\u202f% of Ivorian parliamentarians are women.

Of 60 dossiers, only five were accepted. The council validated incumbent President Alassane Ouattara for a fourth term, while former presidents Laurent Gbagbo and Tidjane\u202fThiam were excluded. Gbagbo had been sentenced to 20\u202fyears in 2018 for the 2010\u20112011 bank\u2011robbery case and was barred from re\u2011entry without a presidential amnesty; Thiam lost Ivorian citizenship in 1987 when he acquired French nationality, leading to his removal from the list. Opposition leaders, including Simon\u202fDoho of the PDCI, complained that the council failed to enforce the law, saying 'Nous avions l'espoir que le droit serait dit, mais le Conseil constitutionnel, cens\u00e9 \u00eatre le temple de la loi et garant de son ex\u00e9cution, n'a pas jou\u00e9 son r\u00f4le'. The council justified the exclusions by citing the absence of the two candidates on the electoral roll. The article notes that the Ivorian government has earmarked \u20ac85\u202fmillion of the \u20ac23.3\u202fbillion 2025 budget for election expenses, compared with the UNDP's $8.3\u202fmillion mobilised in 2015 and a peak of $52\u202fmillion in 2010. It also reports that several opposition activists have been arrested in recent weeks, a move the opposition says is aimed at silencing dissent.

The article states that President Alassane Ouattara, 83, announced in July that he would seek a fourth term, and analysts expect him to win given the weak field of challengers. It also notes that Thiam, the designated candidate of the main opposition party PDCI, was expected to be excluded after a court ruling in April that removed him from the electoral roll because he was a French national at the time of registration. Ivory Coast law requires candidates to be Ivorian citizens and not hold another nationality. The government has promised a peaceful vote amid tensions over eligibility that could fuel unrest.

The incumbent, 83\u2011year\u2011old President Alassane Dramane Ouattara (RHDP), is running for a fourth consecutive term, a move that has sparked controversy and raised questions about constitutional limits. The Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) has received about sixty applications, including those of former opposition leaders Laurent Gbagbo and Tidjane Thiam, who have been declared ineligible; the CEI will forward the list to the Constitutional Council, which will publish the final candidate list on 10 September. The electorate consists of 8.7\u202fmillion registered voters (June\u202f2025), all Ivorian nationals aged 18 or older who enjoy their civil and political rights, as defined in Article\u202f55 of the 2016 Constitution. The election follows a two\u2011round, single\u2011member, majority\u2011vote system: a candidate must secure an absolute majority of valid votes to win outright; otherwise a runoff between the top two candidates is held fifteen days after the first\u2011round results are announced. Voting is conducted by paper ballot in a single ballot box, with voters stamping their fingerprints to prevent fraud; results are counted publicly with observers present.\n\nThe guide also outlines the broader political, economic, and security context. Ivory Coast has experienced the fastest growth in West Africa (average 6\u20117\u202f% per year since 2012), yet regional and social inequalities persist. The cocoa sector, which accounts for 40\u202f% of exports, has been hit by price volatility and disease, threatening farmers\u2019 incomes. Youth unemployment remains high, with over 70\u202f% of the population under 35. Debt servicing for infrastructure projects poses a sustainability challenge. Security concerns include jihadist activity and porous borders with Burkina Faso, which could destabilise the election.\n\nHistorically, no Ivorian presidential election has resulted in a peaceful alternation of power since 1995. The exclusion of prominent opposition figures and Ouattara\u2019s bid for a fourth term may reignite tensions. The credibility of the CEI, the Constitutional Council, and the judiciary will be closely scrutinised, especially in how they handle candidate disqualifications and contested results. The article stresses the need for a transparent, inclusive process to prevent post\u2011electoral violence, recalling the 2010\u20112011 crisis that caused about 3\u202f000 deaths when Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept defeat.\n\nKey metrics: 8.7\u202fmillion voters; 6\u20117\u202f% annual growth; 40\u202f% of exports from cocoa; 3\u202f000 deaths in 2010\u20112011 crisis.

A supporter of Gbagbo states, 'c'est le candidat du peuple. Il n'y a rien \u00e0 dire'. Ouattara\u2019s backers highlight his experience, noting that former president Houphou\u00ebt Boigny 'a pu diriger le pays jusqu'\u00e0 ses derniers jours', and argue that Ouattara can do the same.

This will be his fourth bid for the presidency, and a victory would secure his fourth consecutive term since 2010. Ouattara's rise to power was not without controversy, as he defeated Laurent Gbagbo in the 2010 election, but Gbagbo refused to accept the result, leading to a second civil war in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Ouattara's presidency has been marked by economic growth, with the country's GDP increasing from $34 billion in 2010 to over $80 billion today, making it the second-largest economy in West Africa. However, Ouattara has also faced criticism for his handling of protests in 2020, which resulted in 85 deaths, and for his government's treatment of opposition politicians, including Guillaume Soro, who has been forced into exile. The opposition is fragmented and weakened, and Ouattara's candidacy is seen as a strong favorite for the election. 'La llave de la paz en Costa de Marfil consist\u00eda en no pisotear a los sure\u00f1os, ni dar alas a los temores que les susurraban que la presidencia de Ouattara traer\u00eda un vuelco en las din\u00e1micas de poder establecidas,' said a journalist who has spoken to sources in the north of the country.

The decision raises concerns about national stability, echoing fears of a potential coup, especially after the 2021 military overthrow of Guinea\u2019s President Alpha Cond\u00e9, who had also sought a third term.

Ouattara has a long history of involvement in politics, having served as Prime Minister in 1990 and later becoming president in 2010 after a disputed election. He has been praised for his economic policies, which have led to significant growth and investment in the country. However, critics argue that Ouattara's rule has been marked by corruption, inequality, and a lack of accountability. Ouattara's opponents, including Laurent Gbagbo, have been excluded from the election, and Ouattara has been accused of dictating the tempo of the political game. Ouattara has said that he will not amnistier his rival, leaving him out of the presidential election in 2025.

Videos and messages, mainly in English, claimed that President Alassane Ouattara had been overthrown and that major unrest was sweeping Abidjan. However, the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) quickly denied these allegations, calling them 'false and totally unfounded', and highlighting that they resulted from a 'deliberate and coordinated disinformation campaign'. The Ivorian authorities have called on the population to be vigilant and to refer only to official sources for information. No tangible evidence has been provided to support these rumors, and no major incidents have been reported on the ground. A tense political climate is approaching the elections The Ivorian political context is marked by growing tensions as the presidential election approaches. The potential candidacy of outgoing President Alassane Ouattara for a fourth term has sparked controversy. The 2016 Ivorian Constitution limits the number of presidential terms to two, but Ouattara was re-elected for a third term in 2020, invoking that the new Constitution reset the term counter. Furthermore, opposition leader Tidjane Thiam, a prominent figure of the Democratic Party of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (PDCI), was disqualified from the presidential race in April 2025 due to his dual French-Ivorian nationality. Although he renounced his French nationality in February 2025, the justice deemed that he did not meet the eligibility conditions at the time of his registration on the electoral lists. Contested candidacies and a fragmented opposition In addition to Tidjane Thiam, other major political figures are at the heart of the debates. Laurent Gbagbo, former president, has been designated as a candidate by his party despite his current ineligibility. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Vincent Toh Bi Iri\u00e9, former prefect of Abidjan, is running as an independent, while Jean-Louis Billon, former minister, has confirmed his candidacy. This multiplicity of candidacies, often from the opposition, reflects a political fragmentation that could complicate the formation of a united alternative to the ruling power. Calls for calm and initiatives for peace In the face of these tensions, initiatives aimed at promoting peace and social cohesion are multiplying. On May 24, 2025, an interconfessional conference was held in Abidjan, bringing together Christian and Muslim religious leaders to promote non-violence and national unity ahead of the elections. On the other hand, the UN, through its special envoy for West Africa and the Sahel, Leonardo Santos Sim\u00e3o, met with the main Ivorian political actors in April 2025 to urge them to prioritize dialogue and avoid any escalation of violence. Thus, as the 2025 presidential election approaches, vigilance, respect for institutions, and dialogue between the different stakeholders will be essential to ensure a peaceful and transparent election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[tunisienumerique.com](https://www.tunisienumerique.com/vers-un-nouveau-cycle-de-violence-electorale-en-cote-divoire/)\n\n**Ivory Coast on the Brink of a New Cycle of Electoral Violence?**\nIvory Coast is facing a tense political climate ahead of the presidential election on October 25, 2025.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014including international election observation, electoral integrity, public opinion research, comparative political science, African studies, and sociological analysis\u2014there is a strong, near-universal consensus that Alassane Ouattara is highly likely to be officially awarded 80% or more of the vote in the first round of the 2025 Ivorian presidential election. This consensus is rooted in several key, widely cited factors: (1) the systematic legal exclusion of major opposition candidates (Laurent Gbagbo, Tidjane Thiam), leaving only minor contenders without mass support; (2) persistent fragmentation, demobilization, or boycott of the opposition, with leading figures refusing to endorse alternatives; (3) a recent track record in Ivory Coast and similar regional cases (notably the 2020 and 2015 elections) where such exclusions have produced official landslides of 84\u201394% for the incumbent; (4) tight regime control of electoral institutions, result reporting, and state apparatus, allowing for engineering of outcomes; and (5) the probability that voter abstention or low turnout among opposition-supporting regions further inflates the incumbent's share among valid votes cast. Several experts acknowledge minor risks to a Yes outcome, including the possibility of regime moderation for international legitimacy (reporting a tally just below 80%), spontaneous protest voting, increased spoiled ballots, or unanticipated unrest. However, these scenarios are consistently judged as low probability, lacking current evidence of an effective mobilized or coordinated anti-regime protest. Probability estimates for a Yes outcome (Ouattara 80%+) are tightly clustered in the 85\u201393% range, with most experts at or above 90%. The central, agreed-upon judgment is that, absent an unforeseen political shock or a strategic regime decision to show artificial moderation, Ouattara will be officially reported as winning well above the 80% threshold.",
