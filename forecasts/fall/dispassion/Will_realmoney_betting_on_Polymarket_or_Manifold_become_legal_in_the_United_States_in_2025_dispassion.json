The main remaining obstacle is state-level legal resistance, but there is strong precedent (Kalshi) that CFTC licensing can allow operation in at least some states, even amidst ongoing litigation. The fine print requires legality in at least one state\u2014not universal legality\u2014meaning that if Polymarket is able to launch in any compliant jurisdiction, the question resolves Yes. Manifold is extremely unlikely to be relevant. The risk of a last-minute injunction or unresolved lawsuits creates some uncertainty, but the status quo is already shifting rapidly toward legality, and the CFTC's actions are a strong signal. Given all this, and the very recent, well-documented regulatory shift, the probability is high, but not absolute\u2014there is still some chance of state-level action blocking all operations or of unforeseen delays. I estimate the chance that real-money betting on Polymarket becomes legal in at least one US state (as per the fine print) by the end of 2025 at 86%.",

Polymarket\u2019s acquisition of a DCM license and CFTC no-action letter are both explicit, public regulatory changes that seem to fulfill the question\u2019s resolution criteria. Kalshi\u2019s court wins suggest that, at least in some states, federal preemption is winning out, and even if some states continue to block, the fine print requires only a single state to allow legal operation. State-level resistance remains a real threat, but the planned October 2025 relaunch, ICE investment, and explicit statements in the news about Polymarket\u2019s US return make a Yes outcome highly probable unless a court or regulator blocks it in the next 2.5 months. The biggest risk is a last-minute adverse legal action or a technicality that prevents true real-money betting.

Polymarket has announced a US relaunch with real-money markets in October 2025, and the media coverage unambiguously frames this as a legal return, not merely a risk-based operational decision. While state-level resistance persists and some litigation is ongoing, Kalshi\u2019s recent federal court victories in Nevada and New Jersey support the legal theory of federal preemption for CFTC-regulated markets. The only substantial risks are a rapid reversal by CFTC, successful emergency state/federal court actions, or an operational delay that pushes the relaunch past December 2025. However, with only 2.5 months left in the year and the relaunch imminent, these risks are modest. Manifold remains play-money only and is irrelevant to the forecast. The base rate for new legal prediction markets is low, but the decisive regulatory action by the CFTC marks a break from the status quo, and the strong investor and institutional backing further lowers the odds of reversal.

The fine print requires that real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold be legal in at least one US state, with a public legal or regulatory action. It does not require universal state acceptance or the absence of legal challenges elsewhere. Given Polymarket\u2019s DCM license, CFTC no-action letter, and announced October 2025 US relaunch, the probability is now above 75%.

Public choice theory would also predict that entrenched interests (casinos, state lotteries, gaming commissions) may deploy last-minute political or legal tools to delay or muddy implementation, especially in the face of high-profile, controversial launches.

Other forecasters with expertise in state gaming law, regulatory compliance, and legislative analysis largely converged in the high 85-95% range, citing similar reasoning about the sufficiency of federal action and the low likelihood of a total state-level blockade within the year.

The strongest arguments for an even higher probability emphasize the explicit, public, and recent nature of the CFTC's no-action letter and DCM license for Polymarket, the announced October 2025 relaunch, increasing legal precedent for federal preemption (Kalshi wins), and the resolution criteria's low bar (legality in just one state). Critiques of my initial caution suggest that the likelihood of a last-minute, nationwide state-level injunction or operational delay is lower than I initially weighted, given both the short timeline and the operational momentum. The risk from state-level resistance remains nonzero but is less acute given recent court decisions and the practical difficulties of organizing a total blockade before year-end.

The original question opened on 2025-01-10 20:43:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/31340). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n[Prediction markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market) are exchange-traded markets established for trading bets in the outcome of various events. These could range from the [winner of the US presidential election](https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024) to [bird flu being designated a pandemic](https://kalshi.com/markets/kxnewoutbreakph5n1/new-bird-flu-pandemic) or [an AI winning the International Mathematical Olympiad](https://manifold.markets/Austin/will-an-ai-get-gold-on-any-internat). Similar to Metaculus, prediction markets harness the wisdom of the crowds to provide [accurate](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-market-faq) probabilistic estimates for future events.\n\nPrediction markets are tightly controlled in the US, with very few of them (e.g., [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)) being approved by the CFTC. The largest prediction market as of the writing of this question, [Polymarket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymarket) was fined by the CTFC in 2022 and stopped offering access to US customers. Another large prediction market, [Manifold](https://manifold.markets/) allows users to bet almost exclusively using play money.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":31340,\"question_id\":30969}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, in the calendar year 2025, Polymarket or Manifold can legally offer markets in the United States using real money.",
        "fine_print": "* This has to be legal in at least one US state.\n* A public change in law or government policy must occur for this to resolve as **Yes**, which could include but is not limited to court decisions, public CFTC [<u>no-action letters</u>](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/CFTCStaffLetters/index.htm), executive orders, or new laws. For example, if Manifold or Polymarket were to decide to accept risk under the status quo, satisfying the other criteria with no preceding change in law or government policy, that would not be sufficient. In the event the circumstances are unclear Metaculus may resolve the question as **ambiguous**.\n* For the purposes of this question, real money includes anything that can be legally exchanged for fiat currency. For example, if Polymarket launched \"Polymarket chips\" that one could at any point legally both buy and sell using USD and it was legal to bet on Polymarket using those chips, this question would resolve as **Yes** (in the same way that gambling in a casino with chips is gambling with real money). Similarly any legal cryptocurrencies or crypto tokens (e.g., USDC) would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* If Polymarket or Manifold markets operate using a custom currency (e.g., Manifold sweepcash), to resolve as **Yes** they have to explicitly state that users can exchange fiat currency for the custom currency and vice versa. Manifold's workaround that gives \"free\" sweepcash for mana purchases does not suffice to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Polymarket or Manifold restricting withdrawals only to money that has been previously traded would *not* prevent this question from resolving as **Yes**. A restriction that would allow only money that has been won from a market resolution to be withdrawn, however, *would* prevent this question from resolving as **Yes**.",

The Future of Real-time Trading and Forecasting**\nPolymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Polygon blockchain, has gained significant attention from Wall Street following a US$2 billion investment by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. The partnership positions ICE as a global distributor of Polymarket\u2019s event-driven data, providing institutional clients with real-time market sentiment indicators. ICE and Polymarket also plan to collaborate on tokenization initiatives integrating prediction market data with DeFi technologies. Polymarket operates on a non-custodial, trustless model using smart contracts and the USDC stablecoin, enabling transparent, censorship-resistant trading on real-world events. Its popularity surged during the 2024 US presidential election cycle, with daily trading volumes spiking during key events like the June 2024 presidential debate and the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. By early September 2024, the presidential winner market alone processed hundreds of millions in trading volume. The platform also saw viral engagement from pop culture events, such as Taylor Swift\u2019s engagement to Travis Kelce. Despite a 2022 CFTC enforcement action that led to blocking US users and a US$1.4 million penalty, Polymarket regained regulatory approval after acquiring QCX for US$112 million in Q3 2025, securing a designated contract market license. It now plans to relaunch for US users in October 2025 with four self-certified contract types. While Polymarket is decentralized and international, its main competitor Kalshi, a regulated centralized exchange based in the US, surpassed it in trading volume and market share by September 2025, holding 66% of the global market. Kalshi\u2019s growth is driven by its compliance with US regulations and its focus on real-money contracts. Both platforms are expanding through strategic partnerships\u2014Elon Musk and Donald Trump Jr. have endorsed Polymarket, with X naming it its official prediction market partner in June 2025, and MetaMask planning native integration in 2025. The ICE-Polymarket deal marks a pivotal moment for decentralized forecasting, signaling institutional adoption and the potential integration of real-time event data into mainstream financial strategy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-are-prediction-markets-future-real-time-trading-and-forecasting)\n\n**Prediction markets grow as alternative to casinos**\nPrediction markets have surged in popularity in recent years, challenging traditional casinos amid declining tourism in Las Vegas. Kalshi, one of the two largest players alongside Polymarket, operates under federal regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), allowing it to bypass state-level gambling authorities\u2014even in states where sports betting is illegal. Kalshi recently won two lawsuits in Nevada and New Jersey, affirming its right to operate outside state regulation. The company has a $5 billion valuation, up from $2 billion just three months prior, while Polymarket has grown eightfold since a $1 billion valuation in August. Total trades on Kalshi reached $300 million last year, with projections of over $50 billion in trading volume by 2025. The American Gaming Association, led by CEO Bill Miller, criticizes prediction markets as 'free riders' undermining state-regulated gambling, and companies like Kalshi were excluded from the G2E gaming conference. Despite legal uncertainty, prediction markets are gaining credibility: during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Kalshi projected Donald Trump with over 60% odds, outperforming split polls. Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, argues that prediction markets offer greater accuracy than traditional polls and give participants 'skin in the game.' Donald Trump Jr. has become an adviser to both Kalshi and Polymarket following his father\u2019s 2024 election victory.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[The Center Square: Nevada](https://www.thecentersquare.com/nevada/article_86022fcb-434e-4240-bbce-4641cc7b84e2.html?a)\n\n**Potential Nobel Peace Prize Betting Scandal: Norway Investigates Suspicious Polymarket Activity - Brave New Coin**\nNorwegian authorities are investigating suspicious activity on the crypto prediction platform Polymarket, where three accounts\u2014'dirtycup', '6741', and 'GayPride'\u2014placed large bets on Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, earning combined profits of approximately $90,000. The bets were placed hours before the official announcement on October 10, 2025, with Machado\u2019s odds on Polymarket surging from 3.6% to over 70% within hours. The accounts were newly created with no prior trading history, raising concerns about information leaks. Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, stated that espionage is 'highly likely' the cause, rather than an internal leak, noting that the Nobel Committee\u2019s selection process involves only five members and is kept secret for decades. Nobel Committee Chairman J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes affirmed there has never been a confirmed leak in the prize\u2019s history. The incident occurred amid Polymarket\u2019s $2 billion investment by Intercontinental Exchange, valuing the platform at $9 billion, and its return to U.S. markets after a 2022 $1.4 million fine for operating without registration. Polymarket\u2019s terms do not prohibit insider trading, creating a regulatory blind spot. The platform processed over $6 billion in trades in the first half of 2025 and has drawn scrutiny for predicting high-stakes events with unusual accuracy. The Nobel Peace Prize market alone saw $21.4 million in trading volume from July to October 2025. With competitors like Kalshi capturing over 60% of the global prediction market share and $50 billion in annual volume, the industry is growing rapidly. The case marks the first known instance of a blockchain-based prediction market potentially exposing confidential information from a major international institution, raising urgent questions about information security, regulatory oversight, and the ethics of prediction markets. Machado, 58, was awarded the prize for her work promoting democracy in Venezuela, having founded S\u00famate in 2002 and enduring threats while living in hiding after being barred from the 2024 presidential election. The Norwegian Nobel Institute continues its internal review and plans to strengthen security, though it maintains external espionage is more probable than an internal breach. Neither Polymarket nor the Nobel Institute has issued detailed public statements, and attempts to contact the traders have failed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 09:20 PM\nSource:[Brave New Coin](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/potential-nobel-peace-prize-betting-scandal-norway-investigates-suspicious-polymarket-activity)\n\n**Kalshi and Polymarket valuations exceed $5bn and $8bn**\nPrediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket have achieved valuations of $5 billion and $8 billion, respectively, driven by strong investor confidence despite ongoing regulatory challenges. Kalshi, which is regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), announced a global expansion to over 140 countries, excluding Bulgaria, France, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the UK, Australia, and Canada. This move creates a unified global liquidity pool, a unique feature distinguishing it from fragmented regional platforms. Kalshi raised $300 million in a Series D round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, with its founders emphasizing compliance and licensure as key to building trust. Polymarket, after exiting the U.S. in 2022 due to CFTC settlement, has since re-entered via acquisition and secured a $2 billion investment from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), boosting its valuation to $8 billion. The partnership enables ICE to distribute Polymarket\u2019s event-driven data and collaborate on blockchain initiatives. Both platforms face scrutiny over ethical concerns, such as a spike in bets on Maria Corina Machado winning the Nobel Peace Prize, prompting an official investigation and speculation of data leaks. Regulatory environments remain inconsistent: some countries classify prediction markets as gambling, while others treat them as financial instruments. Despite this, platforms see global growth potential, with Allwyn (UK Lottery operator) acquiring PrizePicks to expand into the U.S. predictions market. Kalshi asserts that 'events don't stop at borders, and now, neither does trading on them,' highlighting the cross-border relevance of prediction markets for elections, central bank decisions, sports, and climate events.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[SBC News](https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2025/10/14/kalshi-polymarket-growth/)\n\n**Senate Dems submit crypto market structure proposal, world ends**\nSenate Democrats have submitted the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), a comprehensive proposal aimed at regulating the crypto market structure, which has sparked strong reactions from the crypto industry and state gaming regulators. The RFIA builds on the CLARITY Act but introduces significant changes, including requiring 'front-end providers' to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols and granting the Treasury Department authority to regulate individuals with 'sufficient influence' in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols\u2014defined at Treasury\u2019s discretion. The proposal has drawn opposition from banks and DeFi advocates, particularly over concerns about 'yield-bearing' stablecoins, with Senator Elizabeth Warren and others pushing for legislative action. Meanwhile, Coinbase has limited USDC rewards, secured New York staking approval, and is preparing to launch its Base token, with staking now legal in all but four U.S. states (California, New Jersey, Maryland, and Wisconsin). In a related development, MetaMask\u2019s integration with Polymarket\u2014allowing users to trade in sports, crypto, and politics within the platform\u2014has angered state gaming regulators, especially as Polymarket and rival Kalshi operate in states where online sports betting is illegal. Nevada regulators issued a cease-and-desist order against Kalshi, which is licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), prompting a preliminary injunction and ongoing legal battles. Other states have followed suit with similar orders, some favoring Kalshi, others not. U.S. senators have written to CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham, demanding clarification on why the CFTC permits such cross-state prediction market operations, arguing it undermines state and tribal authority over sports betting. The senators have requested a response by October 30, 2025. The legislative process faces delays, with Senator Steil warning that approaching the 2026 midterm elections could make passage increasingly difficult. The debate reflects deep divisions over regulatory authority, innovation, and jurisdiction in the evolving digital asset landscape.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[coingeek.com](https://coingeek.com/senate-dems-submit-crypto-market-structure-proposal-world-ends/)\n\n**What are Prediction Markets?

The bets were placed hours before the official announcement on October 10, 2025, with Machado\u2019s odds on Polymarket surging from 3.6% to over 70% within hours. The accounts were newly created with no prior trading history, raising concerns about information leaks. Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, stated that espionage is 'highly likely' the cause, rather than an internal leak, noting that the Nobel Committee\u2019s selection process involves only five members and is kept secret for decades. Nobel Committee Chairman J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes affirmed there has never been a confirmed leak in the prize\u2019s history. The incident occurred amid Polymarket\u2019s $2 billion investment by Intercontinental Exchange, valuing the platform at $9 billion, and its return to U.S. markets after a 2022 $1.4 million fine for operating without registration. Polymarket\u2019s terms do not prohibit insider trading, creating a regulatory blind spot. The platform processed over $6 billion in trades in the first half of 2025 and has drawn scrutiny for predicting high-stakes events with unusual accuracy. The Nobel Peace Prize market alone saw $21.4 million in trading volume from July to October 2025. With competitors like Kalshi capturing over 60% of the global prediction market share and $50 billion in annual volume, the industry is growing rapidly. The case marks the first known instance of a blockchain-based prediction market potentially exposing confidential information from a major international institution, raising urgent questions about information security, regulatory oversight, and the ethics of prediction markets. Machado, 58, was awarded the prize for her work promoting democracy in Venezuela, having founded S\u00famate in 2002 and enduring threats while living in hiding after being barred from the 2024 presidential election. The Norwegian Nobel Institute continues its internal review and plans to strengthen security, though it maintains external espionage is more probable than an internal breach. Neither Polymarket nor the Nobel Institute has issued detailed public statements, and attempts to contact the traders have failed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 09:20 PM\nSource:[Brave New Coin](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/potential-nobel-peace-prize-betting-scandal-norway-investigates-suspicious-polymarket-activity)\n\n**Massachusetts Responds After Robinhood Requests Injunction**\nThe state of Massachusetts has formally opposed Robinhood's motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to block enforcement of its state gambling laws. Robinhood argues that its event-based trading platform, which includes sports outcome contracts, falls under federal commodities law and should be exempt from state regulation. Massachusetts rejected this claim, calling Robinhood's reasoning 'smoke and mirrors' and citing federal court rulings that affirm state authority over gambling regulation. The state referenced a prior case involving Crypto.com, which was barred from offering sports bets in Nevada, and emphasized that states retain the right to independently define gambling, despite Robinhood's assertion that federal law preempts state rules. A similar legal conflict is unfolding in Ohio, where Kalshi has sued the Ohio Casino Control Commission and state attorney general, claiming that Ohio's cease-and-desist actions and warnings to licensed sportsbooks unlawfully blocked its access to users and partners. Kalshi contends its markets are federally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and seeks an injunction before October 20 to halt further enforcement. Ohio officials maintain that only licensed operators may conduct sports wagering in the state. Separately, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) fined DraftKings $450,000 in August for accepting 1,160 unlawful credit card bets totaling over $83,000 between March 2023 and February 2024. The violations, affecting 218 customers and 242 deposits, were attributed to systemic failures in communication and coordination among DraftKings\u2019 compliance, licensing, and product teams, despite the company\u2019s voluntary disclosure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/massachusetts-responds-after-robinhood-requests-injunction-oct-14-2025)\n\n**Investigation Launched into Polymarket Betting on 2025 Nobel Peace Prize Winner**\nNorwegian authorities have launched an investigation into betting activities on the prediction platform Polymarket related to the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, amid concerns of potential espionage. Data from Polymarket revealed that a user named 'dirtycup' earned over $30,000 from bets totaling approximately $70,000 on Machado. Three accounts collectively made around $90,000 in profits from similar wagers. The Norwegian Nobel Institute, which supports the Nobel Committee, is examining reports that betting volumes surged sharply before the announcement, raising suspicions of insider information being exploited. Machado, recognized for her democratic advocacy in Venezuela, previously praised Bitcoin (BTC) as a 'lifesaver' during hyperinflation, enabling citizens to protect wealth and fund escapes. Polymarket, launched in 2020, allows users to bet on diverse events, including Nobel Prizes and music sales. Last week, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion in Polymarket, signaling major growth. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a no-action letter, allowing Polymarket to operate without mandatory data reporting, effectively granting regulatory approval for its U.S. launch. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket\u2019s CEO, reportedly became a billionaire following the ICE investment. The platform has also gained cultural attention, being parodied in the TV series South Park, which humorously depicted prediction markets and U.S. regulatory oversight\u2014ironically, some of its fictional predictions were later listed on Polymarket.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 02:08 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://de.cointelegraph.com/news/wetten-friedensnobelpreis-untersuchung-polymarket)\n\n**The Silent Gold Rush of Polymarket: How Sharp Traders Achieve Risk-Free Profits**\nOn Polymarket, sophisticated traders are generating risk-free profits by exploiting pricing inefficiencies through arbitrage strategies, capitalizing on fleeting market imbalances. The platform\u2019s decentralized prediction market enables risk-free gains when the sum of outcome probabilities falls below $1.00\u2014such as a total of $0.995 across four possible results\u2014allowing traders to buy all outcomes and guarantee a 0.5% profit upon resolution. This strategy, though small in percentage, becomes highly lucrative at scale: a trader investing $10,000 and executing dozens of such trades daily could achieve substantial annual returns. These opportunities, lasting only seconds, are now dominated by automated bots running on the Polygon network, which scan thousands of markets in real time to exploit discrepancies. Another strategy, 'Endgame Sweep,' involves buying near-certain outcomes (priced between $0.95 and $0.99) and waiting for final resolution, relying on the principle that time trades for certainty. However, even this strategy carries 'black swan' risks, such as last-minute reversals due to legal challenges, sports errors, or misinformation. Despite the appearance of fairness, the market is heavily skewed: data from BlockBeats shows only 0.51% of users earn over $1,000, and just 1.74% of trades exceed $50,000 in volume. The vast majority of traders lose money, while a small, technologically advanced minority\u2014using code, speed, and low-latency systems\u2014capture the bulk of profits. These arbitrageurs also serve a vital market-making function by reducing spreads and improving liquidity, with one estimate suggesting they earned over $20 million in the past year. As Polymarket expands\u2014with a 4% yield offer for the 2028 U.S. election market and speculation about an IPO or token airdrop\u2014opportunities for arbitrage are expected to grow, though the playing field remains tilted toward high-frequency, algorithmic traders. As Jeremy Whittaker noted on Medium, 'Arbitrage on Polymarket isn\u2019t gambling\u2014it\u2019s technique. You\u2019re not betting on the outcome. You\u2019re betting on inefficiency.'\nOriginal language: vi\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 09:35 AM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - Vietnam](https://vn.beincrypto.com/polymarket-arbitrage-risk-free-profit/)\n\n**Kalshi Partners with Pyth Network for Blockchain Integration as Prediction Markets Boom**\nKalshi raised $300 million at a $5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, with additional participation from Paradigm and Coinbase, bringing its total funding to $485 million. The company, a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market, announced a strategic partnership with Pyth Network to stream real-time prediction market data\u2014covering events such as the New York City Mayor Election, F1 Drivers Champion, MLB Champion, and Federal Reserve rate cut predictions\u2014across more than 100 blockchains. This marks the first large-scale integration of regulated prediction market data into blockchain ecosystems. Kalshi captured 60% of the combined $1.44 billion trading volume in September, reversing earlier dominance by competitor Polymarket, which raised $2 billion at a $9 billion valuation from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Polymarket operates fully on-chain with all positions publicly visible. Kalshi\u2019s growth is attributed to its partnership with Robinhood, which granted access to a large retail user base. The platform plans to expand to 140 countries and has enlisted Donald Trump Jr. as a strategic adviser. The integration enables developers to build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, derivatives, and governance systems using verifiable, market-priced probabilities.

Kalshi, which is regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), announced a global expansion to over 140 countries, excluding Bulgaria, France, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the UK, Australia, and Canada. This move creates a unified global liquidity pool, a unique feature distinguishing it from fragmented regional platforms. Kalshi raised $300 million in a Series D round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, with its founders emphasizing compliance and licensure as key to building trust. Polymarket, after exiting the U.S. in 2022 due to CFTC settlement, has since re-entered via acquisition and secured a $2 billion investment from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), boosting its valuation to $8 billion. The partnership enables ICE to distribute Polymarket\u2019s event-driven data and collaborate on blockchain initiatives. Both platforms face scrutiny over ethical concerns, such as a spike in bets on Maria Corina Machado winning the Nobel Peace Prize, prompting an official investigation and speculation of data leaks. Regulatory environments remain inconsistent: some countries classify prediction markets as gambling, while others treat them as financial instruments. Despite this, platforms see global growth potential, with Allwyn (UK Lottery operator) acquiring PrizePicks to expand into the U.S. predictions market. Kalshi asserts that 'events don't stop at borders, and now, neither does trading on them,' highlighting the cross-border relevance of prediction markets for elections, central bank decisions, sports, and climate events.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[SBC News](https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2025/10/14/kalshi-polymarket-growth/)\n\n**Nobel Committee Investigates Potential Leak After Polymarket Predicts 2025 Peace Prize Winner Hours Ahead of Announcement**\nThe Nobel Committee is investigating a potential leak after Polymarket, a prediction market platform, accurately predicted Mar\u00eda Corina Machado as the winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize hours before the official announcement. According to Erik Aasheim, spokesperson for the Nobel Institute, a mysterious user with the username '6741' placed large bets on Machado\u2019s victory approximately 12 hours before the announcement, when she was considered an unlikely contender. Within two hours, the market probability for Machado rose from 5% to nearly 70%, driven by this user\u2019s activity on a newly created account. '6741' reportedly earned over $50,000 in profits. Another user, 'GayPride', began placing large bets after public attention grew, ultimately winning more than $85,000. The event raised concerns about insider information, especially given the timing\u2014just after midnight in Oslo\u2014coinciding with the surge in betting activity. Polymarket, which operates offshore and is technically prohibited for U.S. users, does not ban insider trading, so no legal violation may have occurred. The platform, founded five years ago by Shayne Coplan, has faced regulatory scrutiny, including a 2022 settlement with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), leading to the blocking of American users. However, in September, Cryptopolitan reported that Polymarket acquired a licensed CFTC exchange, signaling plans to re-enter the U.S. market. The event gained attention due to Donald Trump\u2019s public campaign for Machado, turning the prize into a trending topic and boosting participation on prediction markets. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) announced plans to invest $2 billion in Polymarket, valuing it at $8 billion, highlighting the growing prominence of prediction markets. Harvard economist Jason Furman commented on the incident on Bluesky, sharing a screenshot of the Polymarket page and stating he now has an answer to questions about insider trading in prediction markets. Economists remain divided on whether insider use improves market accuracy or constitutes unfair manipulation. Polymarket has previously correctly predicted major events, including Trump\u2019s second election victory and Taylor Swift\u2019s engagement.

The trader exited with over $50,000 in profit from a newly created account. Another user, 'GayPride', also profited over $85,000 after noticing the initial surge. Neither Polymarket nor the Nobel Institute responded to media inquiries, and The Wall Street Journal was unable to contact '6741'. Polymarket operates offshore and is technically prohibited for U.S. users, meaning it does not enforce rules against insider trading. Even if a Nobel insider leaked the result, it may not violate U.S. law. Harvard economist Jason Furman commented online, saying he now has a real-world example of insider trading in prediction markets. The prize attracted heightened attention due to Donald Trump\u2019s public campaign for Machado, boosting interest in prediction markets. The Intercontinental Exchange announced plans to invest $2 billion in Polymarket, valuing it at $8 billion.

The platform gained popularity for accurately predicting events like Trump\u2019s second election win and Taylor Swift\u2019s engagement. In September, Polymarket acquired a small CFTC-licensed exchange, signaling a potential return to the U.S. market.

The RFIA builds on the CLARITY Act but introduces significant changes, including requiring 'front-end providers' to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols and granting the Treasury Department authority to regulate individuals with 'sufficient influence' in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols\u2014defined at Treasury\u2019s discretion. The proposal has drawn opposition from banks and DeFi advocates, particularly over concerns about 'yield-bearing' stablecoins, with Senator Elizabeth Warren and others pushing for legislative action. Meanwhile, Coinbase has limited USDC rewards, secured New York staking approval, and is preparing to launch its Base token, with staking now legal in all but four U.S. states (California, New Jersey, Maryland, and Wisconsin). In a related development, MetaMask\u2019s integration with Polymarket\u2014allowing users to trade in sports, crypto, and politics within the platform\u2014has angered state gaming regulators, especially as Polymarket and rival Kalshi operate in states where online sports betting is illegal. Nevada regulators issued a cease-and-desist order against Kalshi, which is licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), prompting a preliminary injunction and ongoing legal battles. Other states have followed suit with similar orders, some favoring Kalshi, others not. U.S. senators have written to CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham, demanding clarification on why the CFTC permits such cross-state prediction market operations, arguing it undermines state and tribal authority over sports betting. The senators have requested a response by October 30, 2025. The legislative process faces delays, with Senator Steil warning that approaching the 2026 midterm elections could make passage increasingly difficult.

Operating with cryptocurrency\u2014specifically the USDC stablecoin\u2014the platform functions like a futures exchange where users buy and sell 'yes' or 'no' shares representing possible outcomes. The price of each share, ranging from US$0.01 to US$0.99, reflects the market's collective probability of an event occurring; for example, a 'yes' share priced at US$0.70 implies a 70% probability of the event happening. If the event occurs, the share is worth US$1, yielding a US$0.30 profit per share. If not, the share becomes worthless. The platform leverages the 'wisdom of crowds' to generate real-time predictions. It recently attracted investment from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, signaling growing interest from traditional finance. However, regulatory challenges persist\u2014particularly in the U.S., where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has raised concerns about its similarity to illegal binary options contracts. Users face significant risks, including cryptocurrency volatility, lack of investor protection, and personal responsibility for wallet security. Access requires a crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and familiarity with USDC transactions, making it accessible but complex for non-technical users. Despite its risks, Polymarket is viewed as a powerful tool for aggregating information and improving forecasting accuracy in areas ranging from politics to business.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[Jornal Estado de Minas | Not\ufffdcias Online](https://www.em.com.br/economia/2025/10/7266933-como-funciona-o-polymarket-a-bolsa-de-apostas-em-acontecimentos.html)\n\n**Prediction markets: What they are and how they work**\nPrediction markets are financial exchanges where individuals can bet on the outcomes of future events by purchasing binary contracts that pay out if the predicted outcome occurs. These markets operate on the principle of the 'wisdom of the crowd' with financial stakes, as described by Leo Chan, CEO of Sportstensor, who emphasizes that the intent is information exchange rather than gambling. Contracts typically pay $1 if correct and cost less based on perceived odds\u2014e.g., a $0.80 'yes' contract implies an 80% expected probability. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates real-money prediction markets in the U.S., and platforms like Polymarket and Robinhood offer access to users, though Polymarket was previously fined $1.4 million and ceased U.S. operations in 2022 under CFTC pressure. Polymarket regained CFTC approval to relaunch in the U.S. in September 2025 and acquired QCEX, a licensed derivatives exchange. Risks include financial loss, market manipulation by well-funded market makers, and legal uncertainty\u2014especially for sporting event contracts, with ongoing cases against Kalshi. Experts are divided on whether prediction markets constitute gambling: Chan argues they are information markets, while Daniel O'Boyle views them as gambling due to financial stakes.

Sequoia venture capitalist Alfred Lin describes the markets to Fortune as \"basically truth machines,\" while Kalshi co\u2011founder Tarek Mansour explains that the markets work because they are a market\u2011based mechanism that provides the wisdom of the crowds and because participants have real money on the line.  Critics, however, argue that the platforms are essentially gambling sites.

Kalshi has offered 'Yes' and 'No' contracts on game outcomes since the Super Bowl in February, and has recently added NFL and college\u2011football markets with spreads and totals. FanDuel announced a partnership with CME Group that will allow it to offer financial prediction markets to its customers, though it has not indicated plans to offer sports\u2011outcome contracts. Polymarket, which was blocked from offering event trading in 2022 by the CFTC, acquired the federally regulated derivatives exchange QCEX for $112\u202fmillion in July, potentially enabling it to introduce sports contracts in the U.S. market. SimilarWeb data from May\u202f2025 show the platform had 15.9\u202fmillion visits, surpassing FanDuel and DraftKings, and it boasts a 94\u202f% accuracy rate in forecasting. Founded in 2020, Polymarket raised $200\u202fmillion earlier this year, pushing its valuation above $1\u202fbillion. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election, more than $3\u202fbillion in contracts were traded on the site. The company now faces a controversial landscape, as Kalshi, which gained traction during last year\u2019s election after a court ruling, is embroiled in legal disputes with several states over sports\u2011outcome contracts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/report-polymarket-targets-fall-us-launch-football-trading-aug-21-2025)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert analyses, there is a clear consensus that the probability of real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the United States before the end of 2025 is very high\u2014typically estimated in the 85-95% range. Experts highlight recent major developments: Polymarket has acquired a CFTC-licensed exchange (QCEX) and has been issued a CFTC no-action letter, both constituting a public and explicit regulatory shift at the federal level. This regulatory action is viewed as directly satisfying the question\u2019s resolution criteria, provided Polymarket actually launches real-money markets for U.S. users in at least one state.\n\nDespite this, several experts caution that state-level legal obstacles remain significant. Multiple states (e.g., Nevada, Ohio, New Jersey, Massachusetts) have issued cease-and-desist orders or are litigating the legality of such platforms under state gambling laws. However, recent court decisions (notably in favor of Kalshi) have affirmed federal CFTC preemption over state bans in some jurisdictions, providing a promising precedent for Polymarket.\n\nManifold is consistently dismissed as irrelevant to the outcome due to its lack of federal regulatory approval or any imminent real-money launch\u2014Polymarket is the sole focus of expected regulatory change for 2025.\n\nThe main risks outlined for a 'No' outcome include: last-minute state or federal injunctions blocking all real-money operations, operational or regulatory delays pushing any U.S. launch into 2026, or an ambiguous regulatory situation that prevents Metaculus from resolving the question as Yes. Experts, however, generally regard these risks as modest given the strong, explicit federal actions and the imminent (October 2025) relaunch plan by Polymarket.\n\nIn summary, experts agree that due to the CFTC no-action letter, a designated contract market license, public plans to relaunch with real-money markets, and the explicit requirement for legalization in only one state, the question will almost certainly resolve 'Yes'\u2014absent an exceptional, last-minute legal or regulatory disruption.",
