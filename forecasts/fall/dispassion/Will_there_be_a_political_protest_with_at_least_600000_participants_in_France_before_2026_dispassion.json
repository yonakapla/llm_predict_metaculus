The argument that government use of Article 49.3 or a new provocation could reignite mass protest is valid, but the forecast may underweight the evidence of protest fatigue (as seen in the sharp drop to 195,000) and the union leadership's current caution, as well as the lack of a major announced new protest. Furthermore, the Ministry of Interior\u2019s conservative counting methods make the 600,000 threshold especially hard to clear.

Furthermore, it wisely balances the extraordinary political opportunity structure and risk of a new flashpoint against the historical base rate and the status quo bias, arriving at a probability (30%) that is realistic given the available evidence.

It accurately identifies both the necessary conditions for mass mobilization (grievance, organization, opportunity) and the obstacles that temper such mobilizations (protest fatigue, lack of scheduled action, and the conservative nature of official counts). The emphasis on a potential trigger event\u2014budget passage, government crackdown, or elite crisis\u2014as a requirement for a protest exceeding 600,000 is well supported by both base rates and the temporal dynamics of protest cycles in France. The moderate probability (32%) demonstrates sound calibration: it is higher than random-year base rates due to acute instability, but not overly bullish in light of declining turnout and high status quo stickiness. The forecast avoids conflating union and official counts and recognizes the typical waning of protest cycles absent new shocks. This approach reflects a sophisticated understanding of how contentious politics unfolds in practice and is a model for integrating theory, base rates, and current trajectory."

The focus on realized rather than potential mobilization aligns with observed protest cycles and crowd risk models: available capacity does not equate to high turnout without a major trigger. The forecast also correctly highlights the conservative nature of Interior Ministry counts (decisive for resolution), the absence of a new scheduled nationwide action, and the demobilizing effects of partial concessions or protest fatigue. The probability (27%) is slightly above the historical base rate, reflecting the present volatility, but resists the temptation to overreact to the acute political crisis by maintaining a strong anchor in observed turnout and official reporting practices. This approach closely matches social movement theory's emphasis on status quo bias, event dependence, and the logistical limits of protest escalation in short timeframes."

While protest fatigue and lack of scheduled mass action are powerful dampeners, French protest cycles\u2014especially under extreme austerity and government legitimacy crises\u2014have repeatedly demonstrated that a single triggering event (such as a budget forced through by Article 49.3 or an act of high-profile police violence) can rapidly mobilize far beyond the apparent status quo. The recent proximity to the threshold (500,000 official) and the unresolved, highly contentious budget fight suggest that the environment is more combustible than your probability (22%) implies. By anchoring so heavily to the most recent downward trend, the forecast may underappreciate the unique ability of French unions and civil society to rapidly shift gears in response to new shocks, particularly within the cultural context of protest as a form of negotiation. While the 600,000 bar is high, it is not out of reach in the current crisis-laden climate."

The move, made following a meeting with centrist and left-wing parliamentary leaders at the Elys\u00e9e Palace\u2014excluding representatives from the right-wing 'National Rally' and left-wing 'La France Insoumise'\u2014was met with strong opposition, with both parties vowing to file a motion of no confidence. Lecornu must form a cabinet and present a new budget by Monday, or France risks another political crisis. Experts, including political analyst Maria Frolova and researcher Sergei Fedorov, argue the decision reflects Macron\u2019s limited options, with no viable alternative capable of forming a stable government. The crisis stems from a 5.4% GDP budget deficit and 114% debt-to-GDP ratio, with the government aiming to save \u20ac44 billion by cutting social spending while maintaining military spending at \u20ac70 billion by 2030. The previous government, led by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, collapsed after parliament rejected austerity measures, including freezing pension indexation and cutting public holidays. Lecornu\u2019s new government is seen as a stopgap, relying on potential compromises with the Socialist Party, which demands the reversal of pension reform. Analysts warn that failure to pass the budget could trigger the dissolution of Parliament, with Macron threatening to 'take responsibility' and call new elections. Without a new budget, France risks operating under temporary legislation, leading to fiscal instability, higher borrowing costs, and investor anxiety. Ongoing nationwide strikes and protests, including a demonstration of up to 200,000 on October 2, underscore deep societal unrest. Despite possible short-term concessions, such as freezing pension reform, the core fiscal challenges remain unresolved, and experts see no clear path out of the crisis, which is rooted in both political fragmentation and economic strain.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 12:07 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1971070/daniil-sechkin/biudzhetnyi-ekstcess-perenaznachenie-lekorniu-ne-zakonchit-krizis-vo-frantcii)\n\n**Macron's Reappointment of Resigning Lecornu Sparks Political Backlash**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's decision to reappoint Sebastien Lecornu as Prime Minister one day after Lecornu's resignation has sparked widespread political backlash across France. Lecornu, in a social media statement, accepted the mission to deliver a budget and solve daily citizens' problems by year-end, emphasizing that stability and an end to political instability are essential for France's image and interests. However, the rapid reversal\u2014Lecornu resigned on Monday and was reappointed by Macron on Friday\u2014provoked strong criticism. Mathilde Panot of the far-left La France Insoumise (LFI) called it a moment of 'revulsion and anger,' accusing Macron of delaying the inevitable: his departure. She announced plans to submit a no-confidence motion and a proposal to remove Macron. Marine Tondelier of the Greens labeled the move 'incredible.' Fabien Roussel of the French Communist Party (PCF) denounced it as 'an unacceptable choice,' stating Macron is disconnected from the people and serving financial elites, calling for new elections. Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally (RN) described the appointment as a 'shame for democracy' and an 'insult to the French people,' pledging to support a no-confidence motion. Marine Le Pen also stated that the dissolution of Parliament is unavoidable. The political crisis followed the collapse of Michel Barnier's government on December 4, 2024, after a disagreement over the 2025 budget. Macron initially appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou on December 13, 2024, but Bayrou's government fell on September 8, 2025, after failing a confidence vote. Bayrou had proposed a 2026 budget with 4.3 billion euro in savings, including the removal of some public holidays, provoking public backlash. Lecornu, appointed on September 9, 2025, resigned the next day due to mounting criticism.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 03:52 AM\nSource:[TRT haber](https://www.trthaber.com/haber/dunya/macronun-istifa-eden-lecornuyu-yeniden-basbakan-atamasi-tepki-cekti-922420.html)\n\n**France's Political Crisis Worsens as Prime Minister Resigns Hours After Cabinet Announcement**\nFrance's political crisis deepened on October 10, 2025, when Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu resigned just 14 hours after announcing a new government cabinet, following strong opposition from his coalition partner, the conservative party Les R\u00e9publicains (LR). Lecornu, who had been in office since September 9, 2024, had unveiled a continuity government that included the return of former Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire to the Defense portfolio\u2014a move that angered LR, as its Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was not consulted. LR, a historically dominant right-wing party, rejected participation in the government, with leader Xavier Bertrand stating, 'We cannot participate in this government.' The political instability stems from the fragmented results of the 2024 legislative elections, which left the National Assembly without a majority, divided among three major blocs: left, center-right, and far-right. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella called for early elections, while left-wing deputy Mathilde Panot urged President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s removal, despite his term ending in 2027. Lecornu\u2019s government failed to secure parliamentary support, having rejected key Socialist Party demands such as a 2% wealth tax on the ultra-rich and reversing the controversial 2023 pension reform. His resignation comes amid ongoing protests by unions demanding greater 'fiscal justice' and pressure from financial markets to reduce public debt, which stood at 115.6% of GDP. His predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, had previously fallen after failing to pass a 2026 budget plan that included \u20ac44 billion in cuts and the elimination of two public holidays. The Paris stock market dropped over 2% at the start of trading.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[noticialibre.com](https://noticialibre.com/2025/10/francia-dimite-el-primer-ministro-a-horas-de-anunciar-su-nuevo-gabinete/)\n\n**Macron on the Ropes: What\u2019s Happening in France?**\nFrance is experiencing a deep political and governability crisis that began in summer 2024 when then-Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou's 2026 budget proposal\u2014featuring 44 billion euro (approximately 51 billion USD) in cuts\u2014sparked widespread public, union, and opposition backlash. Bayrou lost a confidence vote in the National Assembly on September 1, 2024, with 364 votes against, 194 in favor, and 25 abstentions, and resigned on September 9 after eight months in office. Mass protests under the slogan 'Bloqueemos todo' followed, including a nationwide general strike by essential sector unions. On September 9, Emmanuel Macron appointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, previously Minister of Defense, as Prime Minister. Lecornu resigned just 27 days later on October 6, 2024, citing an 'unfavorable political environment,' partisan infighting, and institutional deadlock, making him the shortest-serving Prime Minister in the history of France\u2019s Fifth Republic.

This marks the fifth prime minister to resign in less than two years, following Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, whose unpopular 44-billion-euro austerity budget led to a parliamentary vote of no confidence. Lecornu\u2019s brief term was defined by efforts to continue austerity policies. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s approval rating has plummeted to 17%, with 80% of French citizens expressing distrust in him. The country remains without a functioning budget. Political figures across the spectrum\u2014including Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of France Insoumise, Marine Le Pen of the National Rally, and leaders from the Communist Party and CGT union\u2014have called for either parliamentary dissolution, new elections, or Macron\u2019s resignation. The Communist Party advocated for a left-wing government through cohabitation, proposing a platform including a \u20ac100 immediate increase for workers and retirees, reversal of pension reforms, higher taxation on capital and high incomes, and a \u20ac100 billion fund for industry and public services. They warned that the National Rally, absent from social mobilizations, is not a viable alternative due to its xenophobic and racist platform. The CGT emphasized that Lecornu\u2019s resignation followed massive nationwide protests on September 10, 18, and October 2, driven by opposition to Macron\u2019s imposed pension reform and broader austerity measures. The union criticized Macron\u2019s use of Article 49.3 to bypass parliamentary vote, calling it a democratic failure. Meanwhile, France\u2019s public debt has surged to over \u20ac3.35 trillion\u2014114% of GDP\u2014and is projected to reach \u20ac107 billion annually in debt servicing by 2030. The crisis is further fueled by Macron\u2019s push for military rearmament and support for Ukraine, despite rising social unrest and economic strain. The article frames the situation as a 'silent hemorrhage' of public finances, with wealth concentrated among the elite\u2014French billionaires\u2019 wealth increased sixfold since 2009\u2014while workers and the middle class bear the burden of austerity.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 01:36 PM\nSource:[horadopovo.com.br](https://horadopovo.com.br/governo-macron-agoniza-em-dois-anos-quinto-premie-renuncia/)\n\n**Budgetary Excess: Lecornu's Reappointment Won't End France's Crisis**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sebastian Lecornu as Prime Minister four days after the previous government's resignation, ahead of the October 13, 2025 deadline for submitting the 2026 budget. The move, made following a meeting with centrist and left-wing parliamentary leaders at the Elys\u00e9e Palace\u2014excluding representatives from the right-wing 'National Rally' and left-wing 'La France Insoumise'\u2014was met with strong opposition, with both parties vowing to file a motion of no confidence. Lecornu must form a cabinet and present a new budget by Monday, or France risks another political crisis. Experts, including political analyst Maria Frolova and researcher Sergei Fedorov, argue the decision reflects Macron\u2019s limited options, with no viable alternative capable of forming a stable government. The crisis stems from a 5.4% GDP budget deficit and 114% debt-to-GDP ratio, with the government aiming to save \u20ac44 billion by cutting social spending while maintaining military spending at \u20ac70 billion by 2030. The previous government, led by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, collapsed after parliament rejected austerity measures, including freezing pension indexation and cutting public holidays. Lecornu\u2019s new government is seen as a stopgap, relying on potential compromises with the Socialist Party, which demands the reversal of pension reform. Analysts warn that failure to pass the budget could trigger the dissolution of Parliament, with Macron threatening to 'take responsibility' and call new elections. Without a new budget, France risks operating under temporary legislation, leading to fiscal instability, higher borrowing costs, and investor anxiety. Ongoing nationwide strikes and protests, including a demonstration of up to 200,000 on October 2, underscore deep societal unrest. Despite possible short-term concessions, such as freezing pension reform, the core fiscal challenges remain unresolved, and experts see no clear path out of the crisis, which is rooted in both political fragmentation and economic strain.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 12:07 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1971070/daniil-sechkin/biudzhetnyi-ekstcess-perenaznachenie-lekorniu-ne-zakonchit-krizis-vo-frantcii)\n\n**Macron Reappoints Lecornu as France's Prime Minister**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as Prime Minister on October 10, 2025, following Lecornu's resignation just four days earlier after a 27-day tenure. The Elys\u00e9e Palace announced the decision, citing Lecornu's commitment to 'duty' to ensure France has a budget by year-end and end the political crisis harming the country's image. Lecornu outlined key conditions for accepting the role: parliamentary debate on all issues discussed in recent consultations with party leaders, restoring budget balance, and forming a new cabinet reflecting 'renewal and diversity of competencies.' His urgent tasks include forming a government and submitting the 2026 budget to parliament by October 13. France faces severe economic challenges, with public debt exceeding 114% of GDP and a projected budget deficit of 5.4%. Lecornu\u2019s success depends on his ability to broker compromise in a deeply divided parliament to avoid a vote of no confidence and another crisis. Lecornu was first appointed Prime Minister on September 9, 2025, following the resignation of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou\u2019s government. He previously served as Minister of Defense. This marks the fifth government change in two years. On September 8, 2025, France\u2019s National Assembly passed a vote of no confidence against Bayrou with 364 votes in favor and 194 against, opposing Bayrou\u2019s austerity plans to reduce national debt. Lecornu rejected Bayrou\u2019s proposal to eliminate two holidays\u2014Easter Monday and Europe Day\u2014citing potential social instability, despite the fiscal savings.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 06:58 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/world/55444546-makron-vnov-naznachil-lekornyu-premer-ministrom-frantsii/)\n\n**Macron's Reappointment of Resigning Lecornu Sparks Political Backlash**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's decision to reappoint Sebastien Lecornu as Prime Minister one day after Lecornu's resignation has sparked widespread political backlash across France. Lecornu, in a social media statement, accepted the mission to deliver a budget and solve daily citizens' problems by year-end, emphasizing that stability and an end to political instability are essential for France's image and interests. However, the rapid reversal\u2014Lecornu resigned on Monday and was reappointed by Macron on Friday\u2014provoked strong criticism. Mathilde Panot of the far-left La France Insoumise (LFI) called it a moment of 'revulsion and anger,' accusing Macron of delaying the inevitable: his departure. She announced plans to submit a no-confidence motion and a proposal to remove Macron. Marine Tondelier of the Greens labeled the move 'incredible.' Fabien Roussel of the French Communist Party (PCF) denounced it as 'an unacceptable choice,' stating Macron is disconnected from the people and serving financial elites, calling for new elections. Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally (RN) described the appointment as a 'shame for democracy' and an 'insult to the French people,' pledging to support a no-confidence motion. Marine Le Pen also stated that the dissolution of Parliament is unavoidable. The political crisis followed the collapse of Michel Barnier's government on December 4, 2024, after a disagreement over the 2025 budget. Macron initially appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou on December 13, 2024, but Bayrou's government fell on September 8, 2025, after failing a confidence vote. Bayrou had proposed a 2026 budget with 4.3 billion euro in savings, including the removal of some public holidays, provoking public backlash.

Lecornu, who had been in office since September 9, 2024, had unveiled a continuity government that included the return of former Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire to the Defense portfolio\u2014a move that angered LR, as its Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was not consulted. LR, a historically dominant right-wing party, rejected participation in the government, with leader Xavier Bertrand stating, 'We cannot participate in this government.' The political instability stems from the fragmented results of the 2024 legislative elections, which left the National Assembly without a majority, divided among three major blocs: left, center-right, and far-right. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella called for early elections, while left-wing deputy Mathilde Panot urged President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s removal, despite his term ending in 2027. Lecornu\u2019s government failed to secure parliamentary support, having rejected key Socialist Party demands such as a 2% wealth tax on the ultra-rich and reversing the controversial 2023 pension reform. His resignation comes amid ongoing protests by unions demanding greater 'fiscal justice' and pressure from financial markets to reduce public debt, which stood at 115.6% of GDP. His predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, had previously fallen after failing to pass a 2026 budget plan that included \u20ac44 billion in cuts and the elimination of two public holidays.

The CGT, France\u2019s largest union, estimated participation at 600,000 but acknowledged declining momentum, noting that the September 18 protest had drawn between 500,000 and 1 million demonstrators. The protests followed the resignation of former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou after a parliamentary no-confidence motion. Union leaders, including CGT\u2019s Sophie Binet, emphasized strong public discontent and demanded 'social justice,' arguing that the burden of austerity is not being shared equitably. The demonstrations in Paris remained peaceful, in contrast to recent clashes, with around 76,000 police and gendarmes deployed. Despite a strike call, disruptions were limited: TGV trains and much of the Paris metro operated normally, though regional services (TER, RER, Intercit\u00e9s) experienced delays, and minor air travel issues occurred without major cancellations. The protest occurred just before new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, appointed by Emmanuel Macron, delivered a speech on the political landscape in the National Assembly and finalized the government\u2019s budget plan. Lecornu, a centrist from Macron\u2019s Renaissance party and former member of the conservative Republicans, is the fifth prime minister since 2024, reflecting France\u2019s ongoing political instability.

According to government figures, approximately 195,000 people mobilized nationwide, including 24,000 in Paris, where 5,000 police officers were deployed. The CGT union reported nearly 600,000 participants, while student unions noted 80,000 youth demonstrators\u2014fewer than the 110,000 from the previous month\u2019s strike. Around 6% of the teaching staff joined the strike, marking a lower turnout than expected despite union efforts to pressure Lecornu ahead of his upcoming policy speech. CGT Secretary General Sophie Binet criticized Lecornu as a 'clone of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou' and affirmed that 'social outrage' in France is 'undeniable.' Lecornu had previously announced plans to cut \u20ac6 billion from state spending and target a public deficit of 4.7% of GDP by 2026, promising not to present an 'austerity and social regression budget,' though these proposals have failed to convince unions. This marked the third strike against Lecornu, who has opposed suspending the controversial pension reform passed by former Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. Unions continue demanding more generous pension measures and the reinstatement of the tax on large fortunes.

The protests, organized by the intersyndical coalition, demand the abandonment of the budget proposed by former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, which they describe as 'brutal' for workers, and call for greater social and fiscal justice. Despite the reduced turnout, union leaders emphasize that the sustained momentum\u2014three days of strikes and demonstrations in one month\u2014remains unprecedented, especially as Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu has faced three such actions since his appointment three weeks prior. Lecornu had previously met with union leaders on September 24, 2025, but left them dissatisfied, offering no clear budgetary direction. His recent announcements, including the reinstatement of the Macron bonus, tax reductions for couples slightly above the minimum wage, and inheritance aid, were dismissed by union leaders as 'distractions' and 'minor adjustments' that fail to address core issues like unemployment insurance, public aid to businesses, the 'white year' policy, pension reform, and public sector job cuts. Leaders such as Sophie Binet (CGT), Marylise L\u00e9on (CFDT), Fran\u00e7ois Hommeril (CFE-CGC), and Murielle Guilbert (Solidaires) criticized the measures as recycled right-wing policies lacking substance. Manon Aubry (La France Insoumise) condemned Lecornu\u2019s proposal to revive a controversial retirement reform for women, calling it unacceptable. Marine Tondelier (Ecologistes) accused Lecornu of using a 'chloroform strategy' to pacify protesters with superficial, ideologically conservative measures. Meanwhile, the Socialist Party, led by Olivier Faure, met with Lecornu on Friday, October 3, 2025, to discuss potential non-censure of their deputies, though Faure stated the proposals were 'very below expectations'\u2014yet he left the door open for further dialogue.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:31 PM\nSource:[L'Obs](https://www.nouvelobs.com/social/20251002.OBS108317/greve-du-2-octobre-face-au-budget-de-lecornu-une-troisieme-mobilisation-moindre-avec-la-meme-colere.html)\n\n**Why 500,000 French Protesters Took to the Streets: Targeting Macron and New PM Lecornu**\nOn 18 September 2025, France saw a nationwide wave of protests that drew an estimated 500,000 participants, according to the Interior Ministry, up from about 200,000 the previous week. The demonstrations, which took place in Paris, Lyon and Nantes, were organized by trade unions in response to the government\u2019s austerity plan proposed by former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou. The plan, amounting to 44\u202fbillion euros (\u2248NT$1.6\u202ftrillion), aimed to cut public spending and raise taxes on the wealthy, but was rejected in Parliament and led to Bayrou\u2019s resignation. President Emmanuel Macron subsequently appointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as the new prime minister.\n\nUnion leaders demanded the withdrawal of the budget cuts, increased public\u2011service spending and higher taxes on the rich. CGT secretary\u2011general Sophie Binet told the crowd, \u2018\u6012\u706b\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u6c7a\u5fc3\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u6211\u8981\u5c0d\u7e3d\u7406\u52d2\u514b\u52aa\u8aaa\uff0c\u6c7a\u5b9a\u9810\u7b97\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u5167\u95a3\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8857\u982d\uff01\u2019 (\u2018The anger is great, the determination even greater. I will tell Prime Minister Lecornu that the budget is not decided by the cabinet, but by the streets!\u2019). The protests were largely peaceful, but clashes occurred in the three cities. French police deployed 80,000 officers, riot units, drones and armored vehicles; over 300 people were arrested.\n\nLecornu, who had just taken office a week earlier, announced the scrapping of two national holidays and the curtailment of special privileges for former ministers, yet he has not fully abandoned Bayrou\u2019s austerity agenda. He pledged to negotiate with unions in the coming days but emphasized a willingness to seek \u2018compromise\u2019. The French Parliament remains fragmented, with no single bloc holding a majority, making the passage of a new 2026 budget difficult.\n\nProtesters also targeted President Macron, with a 36\u2011year\u2011old IT engineer Cyrielle stating, \u2018\u99ac\u514b\u5b8f\u7684\u7d93\u6fdf\u8207\u793e\u6703\u653f\u7b56\u6211\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u8a8d\u540c\uff0c\u767d\u80e1\u7684\u9810\u7b97\u4e5f\u4e00\u6a23\u7cdf\u7cd5\u3002\u6211\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u8cc7\u6e90\u6295\u5165\u516c\u5171\u670d\u52d9\u548c\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u8b93\u6709\u9322\u4eba\u591a\u5206\u64d4\u4e00\u4e9b\u3002\u2019 (\u2018I completely disagree with Macron\u2019s economic and social policies, and Bayrou\u2019s budget is equally bad. I want to see more resources invested in public services and culture, so the wealthy share the burden.\u2019). The protests reflected widespread anger over perceived fiscal neglect of ordinary workers and a belief that changing the prime minister does not change policy.\n\nThe article presents factual data\u2014participant numbers, dates, government actions\u2014and includes direct quotes from union leaders and protesters, providing a balanced, evidence\u2011based account of the events.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 05:50 AM\nSource:[\u4e09\u7acb\u65b0\u805e](https://www.setn.com/News.aspx?NewsID=1722620)\n\n**Photo: 'Macron, Get Out!' Massive Protests Against France's Austerity**\nOn September 18, 2025, citizens across France staged a massive protest against the government's austerity measures, marking the second such demonstration since the 10th of the month and coinciding with a nationwide general strike. Major railway, health, education, and energy unions joined the action, declaring a joint action day that led to a large-scale strike. In Paris, thousands gathered at the Bastille Square and marched roughly 5\u202fkm through the city. The French government reported that about 60,000 people participated in Paris and over 500,000 nationwide, while the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) claimed about 1\u202fmillion participants. Interior Minister Bruno Le\u202fTaille announced that 309 protesters were detained and 26 police officers were injured during the crackdown. The protests were sparked by former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou\u2019s announcement on July\u202f7 of a 43.8\u202fbillion\u2011euro (\u2248\u202f71\u202ftrillion\u202fKRW) fiscal deficit cut for the next year\u2019s budget, which faced fierce opposition from the opposition and public opinion, ultimately leading to Bayrou\u2019s resignation in August following a vote of no confidence. The headline phrase \"\ub9c8\ud06c\ub871, \ub098\uac00!\" (\"Macron, get out!\") captured the protest\u2019s sentiment.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 02:41 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/international_general/1219634.html)\n\n**Half a Million Protest in France Against New Prime Minister\u2019s Austerity Plan**\nThe article reports that on September 18, 2025, about 500,000 people marched in France to protest the new prime minister S\u00e9bastien\u202fLecornu\u2019s austerity plan for 2026 and to demand higher taxes on the ultra\u2011rich. The CGT union claimed the turnout was \"more than a million\". The protest was part of a broader wave of demonstrations against President Emmanuel\u202fMacron\u2019s fiscal and social policies, which have sparked several protests since 2017. The former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois\u202fBayrou\u2019s 2026 budget plan had cut 44\u202f000\u202fmillion euros (US$51.9\u202fbillion) and eliminated two public holidays; the new plan will not include the holiday cuts. The demonstration was largely peaceful, but police and gendarmes deployed 80,000 officers, used tear gas in cities such as Paris, Nantes and Rennes, and detained 181 participants. In Paris, a group of demonstrators briefly entered the Ministry of Finance and urged the government to \"find the money where it is: in the pockets of the richest,\" as stated by Fabien\u202fVilledieu of the SUD\u202fRail union. The protest also called for the abolition of the 2023 pension reform, more public services, and the implementation of a \"Zucman tax\"\u2014a 2\u202f% annual levy on wealth above \u20ac100\u202fmillion (US$118\u202fmillion), which 86\u202f% of French citizens reportedly support. The article notes that the new budget must be presented by mid\u2011October amid a fiscal deficit of 5.8\u202f% of GDP and a public debt of 114\u202f%. The Fitch agency downgraded France\u2019s sovereign debt rating on the same day, adding pressure on the government. The piece concludes that the protests signal a clear warning to Lecornu and may intensify the political crisis and calls for Macron\u2019s resignation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:55 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/internacional/2025/09/18/medio-millon-de-personas-protestaron-en-francia-contra-el-plan-de-ajuste-del-nuevo-primer-ministro/)\n\n**Thousands Protest Against Austerity in France Amid Budget Controversy**\nThousands of French citizens gathered on Thursday, 18 September, in cities across France to protest against the government's austerity measures and demand higher taxation of the wealthy. The protest, organized by unions, aimed to pressure new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu to abandon the 2026 budget plan that proposes \u20ac44\u202fbillion in cuts and the removal of two public holidays. According to authorities, about 500\u202f000 people took part, while the CGT union claimed more than one million. Protesters cited the 86\u202f% support for a 'Zucman tax' that would levy 2\u202f% annually on assets over \u20ac100\u202fmillion. The day began with strikes and blockades of public transport and schools; more than 80\u202f000 police and gendarmes were deployed, and 181 people were detained by the Interior Ministry. A symbolic 20\u2011minute occupation of the Ministry of Finance was led by Fabien Villedieu of the SUD Rail union, who said the government should 'look for the money where it is: in the pockets of the rich'. Lecornu has rejected the Zucman tax but said he is 'willing' to discuss fiscal justice with unions. The crisis is intensified by Fitch's downgrade of France's sovereign debt rating and the rise in public discontent. The budget will be presented in mid\u2011October amid pressure to reduce the deficit and the debt, which stands at 114\u202f% of GDP. Left\u2011wing leader Jean\u2011Luc M\u00e9lenchon has called for Macron's resignation, echoing chants at the protests.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/mundo/milhares-protestam-contra-a-austeridade-na-franca-em-meio-a-controversia-orcamentaria/)\n\n**French Unions Announce 400,000 Protesters Against Austerity Plan**\nFrench unions have announced a mass protest against the summer austerity plan, with the CGT claiming 400,000 demonstrators across major cities such as Paris, Marseille, Besan\u00e7on, Clermont\u2011Ferrand and Toulouse. The French Interior Ministry has cut that figure to 76,500. The strike has heavily disrupted urban transport; in Paris, all lines except the automated ones are closed, operating only during peak hours with a minimal service. According to the FSU\u2011SnuiPP, one\u2011third of teachers at the nursery and elementary levels are on strike. French intelligence services predict that the Thursday mobilisation will be larger than the September 10 event organised by the citizen movement \u201cBloqueemos todo.\u201d Early this morning, clashes between police and protesters were reported in Marseille and Paris, where students erected barricades made of urban furniture in front of university and high\u2011school entrances. Police recorded 63 blocking actions nationwide, including \u201csnail\u201d operations on southeastern highways to slow traffic. The protest was called after former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou presented a budget cutting 44\u202fbillion euros and eliminating two public holidays. Following Bayrou\u2019s loss of a confidence motion, President Emmanuel Macron appointed Sebastian Lecornu as the new prime minister, who is still negotiating with parties to form a new government and draft a more consensual budget, but has yet to succeed.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 02:37 PM\nSource:[Acento](https://acento.com.do/rfi/francia-los-sindicatos-anuncian-400-000-manifestantes-contra-el-plan-de-recortes-9552282.html)\n\n**French Workers Strike Against Fiscal Austerity Plans**\nOn September 18\u202f2025, French unions mobilized up to 800,000 people in strikes across the country to protest austerity measures. They demanded the abandonment of budget cuts, more investment in public services, taxation of the wealthy, and the repeal of a pension reform that increased the retirement age. In a joint statement the unions called the fiscal measures \"'brutais'\" and \"'injustas'\". In Paris, several metro lines were suspended except during peak hours; students blocked school entrances; and traffic was reduced on a highway near Toulon. President Emmanuel Macron and new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu face pressure from parliament and investors concerned about France\u2019s deficit. The teachers\u2019 union FSU\u2011SNUipp reported that one in three primary teachers nationwide, nearly half in Paris, were on strike. EDF\u2019s nuclear production fell by 1.1\u202fGW at the start of the day. The pharmacists\u2019 union USPO found that 98\u202f% of pharmacies could close that day. The Interior Ministry deployed 80,000 police, including riot units, drones and armored vehicles, to monitor the demonstrations. The previous budget plan by former PM Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou called for a \u20ac44\u202fbillion adjustment; Bayrou was ousted by parliament last week. Lecornu signaled willingness to negotiate but has not detailed specific measures. France\u2019s last fiscal deficit was almost twice the EU 3\u202f% ceiling, heightening pressure for fiscal adjustments. Lecornu will need support from other parties to pass the 2026 budget.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 12:43 PM\nSource:[Poder360](https://www.poder360.com.br/poder-internacional/trabalhadores-franceses-fazem-greve-contra-planos-de-austeridade-fiscal/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across eight expert perspectives (OSINT Analysis, Crisis Management, multiple branches of Political Science and Sociology, and French Studies), there is a high degree of consensus in both the qualitative assessment and quantitative forecast. All experts emphasize that the Ministry of the Interior's official protest counts are conservative and that, historically, French protests exceeding 600,000 participants (per official count) are rare, even in periods of severe political and economic crisis. The recent high point was 500,000 (official) on September 18, 2025, with subsequent protests dropping significantly (195,000 on October 2) despite persistent union and public anger over austerity measures and political instability. \n\nKey factors that could increase the likelihood of a 600,000+ protest include: the ongoing government crisis, deep grievances across multiple social sectors, elite fragmentation, and the potential for a dramatic trigger such as a harsh new austerity move, forced budget passage via Article 49.3, or perceived violent repression. Most experts argue these could catalyze a massive, coordinated protest if unions and opposition are unified and motivated by fresh outrage. Conversely, factors such as protest fatigue, government concessions, lack of new trigger events, and constraints related to time (seasonal effects, holiday period approaching) decrease the probability. \n\nWhile all experts recognize a non-negligible risk of a major escalation before January 1, 2026, none see it as more likely than not. Their final probabilities cluster between 22% and 38%, with most in the 22\u201332% range. The few higher estimates (38%) reflect greater weight given to potential external shocks and France's historical protest culture in times of profound crisis, but even these forecasts do not cross a 40% confidence threshold. The group is united in the view that, absent a major new catalyst, official tallies will likely stay below the 600,000 mark.",
