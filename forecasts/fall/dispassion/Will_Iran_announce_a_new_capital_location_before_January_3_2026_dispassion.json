However, no source provides evidence of a formal, specific announcement naming a new capital location as of early December. Historically, even in severe crises, countries have been slow to make such declarations; Iran\u2019s own history is one of repeated proposals but little follow-through. The public administration context highlights the immense inertia, bureaucratic friction, and political risk involved, which tend to delay or dilute action until absolutely unavoidable. While the probability of an announcement is far higher now than at any prior point (perhaps the highest since the 1979 revolution), the base rate for such announcements globally is extremely low, and the government\u2019s pattern leans toward rhetoric and incremental measures over irreversible public commitments. Nevertheless, the risk of collapse and unrest may tip the scales, and the repeated naming of candidate regions (Makran, Hormozgan) raises the possibility that, in extremis, a formal announcement could be made\u2014especially to pre-empt or channel unrest. I therefore assign a probability substantially higher than the long-term status quo, but not so high as to ignore persistent institutional constraints and the absence, so far, of a formal, location-naming announcement.",

There is a credible path to a Yes, as the regime may feel compelled to make a landmark announcement to demonstrate control and vision, especially if the crisis worsens in the coming weeks. Yet, the most likely outcome remains inertia, with more studies and vague promises, unless the crisis dramatically worsens and elites are unified.

Even in the face of severe crises, formal announcements naming a specific new capital have been extraordinarily rare in global comparative perspective; most such moves are preceded by years of studies, vague commitments, and elite bargaining. The pattern in Iran has been to float grand proposals at moments of crisis without issuing binding, location-specific decrees, especially given the need for Supreme Leader and IRGC approval. The forecast would be improved by grounding more explicitly in the global and Iranian base rate for such announcements, which remains very low despite the unprecedented pressure.

The analysis is nuanced in recognizing that, while catastrophic loss and threats to regime legitimacy can prompt leaders to make bold, symbolic announcements (when implementation can be deferred), the actual history of such decisions in Iran and globally is one of extreme caution and delay. The forecaster rightly highlights that a mere announcement (not implementation) is sufficient for question resolution, but still anchors their probability well below 50% due to the conservative nature of authoritarian governance, the need for top-level consensus, and the absence of a clear, official statement as of yet. This approach is well-calibrated given the available evidence, and the assigned probability (35%) appropriately reflects both the extraordinary circumstances and the practical realities of political decision-making in Iran."

By weighing the competing impulses\u2014pressure for regime survival through symbolic action versus elite consensus and inertia\u2014the 35% probability is both defensible and prudent.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned in early December that water rationing would be implemented if no rain falls by December, stating that residents may be forced to evacuate\u2014though experts question the feasibility of such an evacuation. The crisis extends far beyond Tehran: according to Dr. Mousen B. Mesgaran, Associate Professor of Plant Sciences at the University of California, Davis, no rainfall has occurred in about 20 Iranian provinces since the start of the rainy season in September. Reuters reports that approximately 10% of Iran\u2019s dams are effectively dry. Underlying causes include decades of over-extraction, aging and leaky infrastructure, excessive dam construction, poor management, and corruption, all exacerbated by climate change, which has driven rising temperatures and prolonged droughts, preventing replenishment of dried reservoirs. Iran\u2019s current drought is the worst in at least 40 years. While water scarcity is common in the country\u2019s generally semi-arid climate, Tehran\u2014home to most of the wealthy and powerful\u2014has historically been spared. According to Tehran Province Water Health Authority, major dams supplying the city are at just 11% capacity, with the Latyan Dam at only 9%. Since May, water levels have drastically dropped, leaving riverbeds nearly dry with only minimal flow remaining. Outside Tehran, reservoirs supplying Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second-largest city with about 3 million people, have dropped to just 3% capacity, according to ISNA news citing local water authorities. Iran\u2019s environmental deputy minister, Kaveh Madani, describes the situation as a long-term, irreversible catastrophe, declaring Iran is in a state of 'water bankruptcy,' with groundwater extraction far exceeding natural recharge rates, affecting rivers, lakes, wetlands, and aquifers.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 06:26 AM\nSource:[CNN.co.jp](https://www.cnn.co.jp/world/35241146.html)\n\n**Iran's president calls for moving its drought-stricken capital amid a worsening water crisis  --  how Tehran got into water bankruptcy**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has revived the long-debated proposal to relocate Tehran, the capital with a population of 15 million, due to an escalating water crisis. The city faces an impending 'Day Zero'\u2014when it runs out of water\u2014amid one of Iran's worst droughts in decades. Although fall marks the start of the rainy season, precipitation has been well below normal in four of the past water years since 2020, and fall 2025 was the hottest and driest on record for Tehran since 1979. The crisis stems from decades of overconsumption, inefficient agriculture, subsidized water and energy use, uncontrolled urban expansion, and centralized water governance that has failed to balance supply and demand. Iran's reliance on water-intensive farming and large-scale dam projects since the 1979 revolution, compounded by international sanctions and economic isolation, has exacerbated the situation. Experts warn that without systemic reforms addressing consumption, agriculture, and planning, the water crisis will persist nationwide, endangering millions. Despite warnings for years, the country remains vulnerable to extreme climate conditions, and the current drought underscores the reality of Iran's 'water bankruptcy'\u2014a state where demand permanently exceeds supply. The president emphasized in November 2025 that relocation is not a choice but a necessity if no action is taken.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 05:12 AM\nSource:[Down to Earth](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/irans-president-calls-for-moving-its-drought-stricken-capital-amid-a-worsening-water-crisis-how-tehran-got-into-water-bankruptcy)\n\n**Tehran's Water Bankruptcy: A Capital City Dying of Political Blindness**\nTehran, Iran's capital, faces a severe water crisis that could lead to its relocation, according to President Masoud Pezeshkian, who warned in December 2025 that the city may no longer guarantee water for its 10 million residents. The crisis, described as 'water bankruptcy,' stems from decades of unsustainable urban expansion, over-extraction of groundwater, and weak environmental governance. Satellite data from CSIS (2024) showed declining reservoir levels, and by early 2025, AP News reported that Tehran's main dams operated at less than 10% capacity. Groundwater depletion has caused land subsidence, with hydrologists confirming emergency pumping levels. Climate change exacerbated the situation, but the root cause is political mismanagement. A 'water mafia' network, involving illegal wells and corrupt water permits, thrived due to lack of oversight. Agriculture, consuming nearly 90% of Iran\u2019s freshwater, continues to cultivate water-intensive crops like pistachios, wheat, and rice in arid regions, protected politically despite ecological limits. President Pezeshkian\u2019s proposal to relocate the capital to Iran\u2019s southern coast\u2014where desalinated water is more accessible\u2014has been seen as a sign of institutional failure rather than a sustainable solution. Critics argue relocation does not address root causes: entrenched corruption, agricultural overuse, or weak environmental institutions. As noted by an environmental analyst cited in The Guardian (2025), 'If the governance model stays the same, Iran will simply build another future crisis in a different location.' Tehran\u2019s crisis serves as a global warning: urban survival in the 21st century depends not on political power but on ecological humility. Major cities like Mexico City, Cape Town, and Jakarta face similar threats, underscoring that water scarcity becomes catastrophic not from drought alone, but from governmental denial and delayed adaptation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@krisnadana1997/tehrans-water-bankruptcy-a-capital-city-dying-of-political-blindness-67fa2c0bd095)\n\n**Megalopolis with 18 Million Inhabitants Faces Environmental Collapse and May Be Evacuated**\nTeher\u00e3, the capital of Iran with approximately 18 million people in its metropolitan area, is on the brink of environmental collapse due to a severe drought that has persisted for six years. Authorities warn that the city may become uninhabitable within weeks if rainfall does not return. All major reservoirs, including the Amir Kabir Dam\u2014the largest\u2014have reached critically low levels: the dam now holds only 10% of its capacity, down from 86 million cubic meters last year, sufficient for only a few more weeks of supply. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, stated that if rain does not return by year\u2019s end, the government may have to implement strict rationing and, as a last resort, evacuate the city. Water shortages are already evident: residents report dry taps at night, and some areas have no water for hours or days. Experts attribute the crisis not only to climate change and a century\u2019s worst drought but also to decades of poor water management, including over-extraction of aquifers, excessive irrigation, construction of numerous dams, and inadequate infrastructure. The result is a 'water bankruptcy'\u2014surface reserves depleted, aquifers exhausted, and recovery unlikely even with heavy rainfall. Urban sprawl, population growth, and unequal water consumption have further strained a system already operating at maximum capacity. The crisis risks triggering internal migration, social tensions, and economic disruption across agriculture, industry, and public services. While the government has announced the possibility of evacuation, experts believe this is a warning rather than a feasible plan due to the immense logistical, infrastructural, and financial challenges. Instead, the government is likely to implement strict rationing, scheduled water cuts, public conservation campaigns, industrial and domestic usage restrictions, and cloud seeding\u2014though the latter\u2019s effectiveness remains scientifically disputed. The situation in Teher\u00e3 reflects a global trend: megacities in arid regions are increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts intensified by climate change and unsustainable development. Experts stress the urgent need for long-term reforms, including rational water governance, agricultural restructuring, investment in sanitation and water recycling, and equitable access policies to prevent Teher\u00e3 from becoming a precedent of urban collapse.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 07:04 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/agenda-verde/megalopole-com-18-milhoes-de-habitantes-esta-a-beira-do-colapso-ambiental-e-pode-ser-evacuada/)\n\n**Iran's president calls for moving its drought-stricken capital amid a worsening water crisis - how Tehran got into water bankruptcy**\nIran's capital, Tehran, is facing an imminent 'Day Zero'\u2014a point at which the city could run out of water\u2014due to one of the worst droughts in decades. According to the article, rainfall has been severely below normal since 2020, with Fall 2025 being the hottest and driest on record since 1979. Key reservoirs are nearly dry, and groundwater reserves are under extreme stress. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has revived the long-debated plan to relocate the capital, framing it as a necessity rather than an option, warning that Tehran could become uninhabitable if no action is taken. The crisis stems from decades of unsustainable water use, including overpumping aquifers, water-intensive agriculture, subsidized energy and water, and rapid urbanization driven by economic centralization. Iran\u2019s centralized water governance has failed to balance supply and demand, leading to 'water bankruptcy'\u2014a state where demand permanently exceeds supply. Despite efforts like the Taleqan-to-Tehran water transfer, such interbasin transfers have often fueled unsustainable growth rather than conservation. Experts, including former officials and water scientists, argue that relocating the capital is unlikely to solve the core issue of population-driven demand. Instead, they advocate for systemic reforms: shifting to less water-intensive agriculture, importing water-intensive crops, improving urban water conservation, expanding wastewater recycling, and investing in aquifer recharge and desalination. The article concludes that without addressing the root causes of water overuse and economic dependency on water, relocating the capital will be ineffective.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 01:12 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/irans-president-calls-for-moving-its-drought-stricken-capital-amid-a-worsening-water-crisis-how-tehran-got-into-water-bankruptcy-270456)\n\n**Pollution Rises, Water Falls, and Tehran Pays the Price**\nTehran faces a dual crisis of severe air pollution and a rapidly depleting water supply, with schools closing and hospitals warning of serious health risks due to hazardous smog. Iran's president has acknowledged the capital may need to be relocated as water levels fall to historic lows. While drought and climate change contribute, the root cause is decades of mismanagement: unchecked urban expansion, industrial growth, and agricultural subsidies that drained aquifers, coupled with weak enforcement of environmental regulations. Unlike India and China, which have implemented traffic restrictions, factory shutdowns, cleaner fuels, and emission controls to combat pollution, Iran continues prioritizing large-scale projects for political gain over sustainable infrastructure. The lack of investment in water systems, wastewater treatment, and clean energy has created a fragile system that collapses under stress. The article warns that failing states like Iran, unable to ensure basic needs like clean air and water, become unstable, increasing regional tensions and global economic risks. The crisis underscores the importance of long-term environmental planning and accountability, contrasting Iran\u2019s stagnation with the reform efforts seen in India and China.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 02:23 PM\nSource:[PJ Media](https://pjmedia.com/david-manney/2025/12/02/pollution-rises-water-falls-and-tehran-pays-the-price-n4946614)\n\n**Iran President Warns Of Potential 'Evacuation' As Tehran's Taps Run Dry**\nIran is facing its worst drought in at least 40 years, with Tehran\u2014home to around 15 million people\u2014experiencing severe water shortages. President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that if rain does not arrive by December, water rationing may be enforced, and residents might have to evacuate. Tehran's main reservoirs are critically low: Latyan Dam is at about 9% capacity, Amir Kabir Dam at roughly 8%, and in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, reservoirs are only 3% full. Around 20 provinces have received no rain since late September, and about 10% of Iran\u2019s dams are effectively dry. Experts attribute the crisis to decades of mismanagement, including over-extraction of groundwater, poorly maintained infrastructure, and massive water loss\u2014estimated at 30% of treated drinking water lost through leaky distribution systems. Climate change has intensified the drought, with a World Weather Attribution study stating that the current conditions 'would not have been possible without human-caused climate change.' The drought is now in its sixth consecutive year. Despite no official rationing, many Tehran residents report low water pressure and intermittent dry taps. Poor government communication has fueled mistrust and conspiracy theories, such as claims that foreign powers are 'stealing clouds.' Experts, including Mohsen B. Mesgaran and Kaveh Madani of the UN University\u2019s water institute, warn that Iran is in 'water bankruptcy.' The government has attempted cloud seeding, which Madani described as a 'desperate' measure to appear proactive. Evacuation of Tehran is considered highly unlikely due to lack of viable alternatives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 10:07 AM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/have-to-evacuate-iran-president-issues-warning-as-tehran-s-taps-run-dry-9736048)\n\n**Tehran Faces Collapse: Satellite Images Reveal Devastating Water Crisis in Iran**\nTehran, the capital of Iran with approximately 15 million residents, faces the imminent threat of complete water depletion. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned in early December that water rationing would be implemented if no rain falls by December, stating that residents may be forced to evacuate\u2014though experts question the feasibility of such an evacuation. The crisis extends far beyond Tehran: according to Dr. Mousen B. Mesgaran, Associate Professor of Plant Sciences at the University of California, Davis, no rainfall has occurred in about 20 Iranian provinces since the start of the rainy season in September. Reuters reports that approximately 10% of Iran\u2019s dams are effectively dry. Underlying causes include decades of over-extraction, aging and leaky infrastructure, excessive dam construction, poor management, and corruption, all exacerbated by climate change, which has driven rising temperatures and prolonged droughts, preventing replenishment of dried reservoirs. Iran\u2019s current drought is the worst in at least 40 years. While water scarcity is common in the country\u2019s generally semi-arid climate, Tehran\u2014home to most of the wealthy and powerful\u2014has historically been spared. According to Tehran Province Water Health Authority, major dams supplying the city are at just 11% capacity, with the Latyan Dam at only 9%. Since May, water levels have drastically dropped, leaving riverbeds nearly dry with only minimal flow remaining. Outside Tehran, reservoirs supplying Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second-largest city with about 3 million people, have dropped to just 3% capacity, according to ISNA news citing local water authorities. Iran\u2019s environmental deputy minister, Kaveh Madani, describes the situation as a long-term, irreversible catastrophe, declaring Iran is in a state of 'water bankruptcy,' with groundwater extraction far exceeding natural recharge rates, affecting rivers, lakes, wetlands, and aquifers.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 06:26 AM\nSource:[CNN.co.jp](https://www.cnn.co.jp/world/35241146.html)\n\n**Drops by Drops: How Iran\u2019s Water Crisis Warns Azerbaijan and the World**\nThe water crisis in Iran has reached a critical stage, with Tehran's five main reservoirs filled to less than 5% capacity due to prolonged drought and climate change impacts. President Masud Pezeshkian stated that the capital may need to be relocated if no significant rainfall occurs by winter, a concern now moving from discussion to serious consideration. The city is also sinking at a rate of 30 centimeters per year due to excessive groundwater extraction from unregulated boreholes, primarily for agricultural irrigation. This over-extraction, combined with the construction of numerous dams and reservoirs in a region with low river flow, has disrupted the hydrological balance, leading to the shutdown of a hydroelectric plant in Khuzestan due to critically low water levels. In 2024, Iran received only 3% of its normal rainfall, and one-tenth of its reservoirs are on the verge of drying out, affecting both water supply and energy production. Iran is seeking international cooperation and technological exchange, particularly with China, to address the crisis. A breakthrough technology developed by Shanghai Jiao Tong University enables atmospheric water harvesting using condensation, absorption, and heat pumps, which could work in high-temperature, low-humidity climates. Globally, freshwater reserves have sharply declined since 2014, according to a UN report and satellite data, indicating a potential shift toward a permanent dry phase. The World Bank ranks Brazil, Russia, Canada, the US, and China as the top freshwater holders, while Azerbaijan is among countries at risk of dehydration. Over the past 40\u201345 years, Azerbaijan\u2019s freshwater reserves have decreased by 25%, with the Caspian Sea level dropping by about two meters since the 1980s. Water loss in irrigation and transport systems remains high, with nearly 50% of drinking water lost during transit. Over 70% of Azerbaijan\u2019s water resources originate outside its borders, and the country holds only 15% of the South Caucasus region\u2019s total water resources\u2014less than Georgia (62%) and Armenia (23%). After the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, 14 formerly lost rivers and water bodies returned to Azerbaijan, contributing 24% of its internal water resources. The country has adopted a National Strategy for Efficient Water Use (2024\u20132040), aiming to digitize water management, implement real-time monitoring, expand modern irrigation to 10% by 2027, provide drinking water to 85% of the population and irrigation water to 90%, and reduce water losses. Experts emphasize that while global climate change cannot be halted, proper water management can prevent crisis. The Iranian situation serves as a stark warning: every drop must be conserved.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https://news.day.az/ecology/1799045.html)\n\n**Iran's president calls for moving its drought-stricken capital amid a worsening water crisis  --  how Tehran got into water bankruptcy**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has revived the long-debated proposal to relocate Tehran, the capital with a population of 15 million, due to an escalating water crisis. The city faces an impending 'Day Zero'\u2014when it runs out of water\u2014amid one of Iran's worst droughts in decades. Although fall marks the start of the rainy season, precipitation has been well below normal in four of the past water years since 2020, and fall 2025 was the hottest and driest on record for Tehran since 1979. The crisis stems from decades of overconsumption, inefficient agriculture, subsidized water and energy use, uncontrolled urban expansion, and centralized water governance that has failed to balance supply and demand. Iran's reliance on water-intensive farming and large-scale dam projects since the 1979 revolution, compounded by international sanctions and economic isolation, has exacerbated the situation. Experts warn that without systemic reforms addressing consumption, agriculture, and planning, the water crisis will persist nationwide, endangering millions. Despite warnings for years, the country remains vulnerable to extreme climate conditions, and the current drought underscores the reality of Iran's 'water bankruptcy'\u2014a state where demand permanently exceeds supply. The president emphasized in November 2025 that relocation is not a choice but a necessity if no action is taken.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 05:12 AM\nSource:[Down to Earth](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/irans-president-calls-for-moving-its-drought-stricken-capital-amid-a-worsening-water-crisis-how-tehran-got-into-water-bankruptcy)\n\n**Water crisis deepens across Iran as Tehran's taps run dry- All you need to know**\nIran is experiencing its worst water scarcity crisis in decades, with officials warning that Tehran\u2014home to over 10 million people\u2014may become uninhabitable if the drought persists. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated on November 6, 2025, that if no rainfall occurs by the end of December, the government must begin water rationing in Tehran, and if rain still does not come, citizens may need to evacuate the capital. The crisis is driven by multiple factors, including decades of mismanagement, overbuilding of dams, illegal well drilling, inefficient agricultural practices, climate change, and over-consumption. Climate change has intensified the situation by causing record-high temperatures\u2014reaching up to 50 degrees Celsius in some regions\u2014and accelerating evaporation and groundwater depletion. In response, the government declared emergency public holidays in July and August to reduce water and energy use, closed some banks and public buildings, and implemented temporary measures such as reducing water pressure and transferring water from other reservoirs to Tehran. Past water shortages have triggered violent protests in Khuzestan province (2021) and among farmers (2018), highlighting the political sensitivity of the issue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 04:26 AM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/water-crisis-deepens-across-iran-tehran-taps-run-dry-all-you-need-to-know-10397189/)\n\n**Tehran's Water Bankruptcy: A Capital City Dying of Political Blindness**\nTehran, Iran's capital, faces a severe water crisis that could lead to its relocation, according to President Masoud Pezeshkian, who warned in December 2025 that the city may no longer guarantee water for its 10 million residents. The crisis, described as 'water bankruptcy,' stems from decades of unsustainable urban expansion, over-extraction of groundwater, and weak environmental governance. Satellite data from CSIS (2024) showed declining reservoir levels, and by early 2025, AP News reported that Tehran's main dams operated at less than 10% capacity. Groundwater depletion has caused land subsidence, with hydrologists confirming emergency pumping levels. Climate change exacerbated the situation, but the root cause is political mismanagement. A 'water mafia' network, involving illegal wells and corrupt water permits, thrived due to lack of oversight. Agriculture, consuming nearly 90% of Iran\u2019s freshwater, continues to cultivate water-intensive crops like pistachios, wheat, and rice in arid regions, protected politically despite ecological limits. President Pezeshkian\u2019s proposal to relocate the capital to Iran\u2019s southern coast\u2014where desalinated water is more accessible\u2014has been seen as a sign of institutional failure rather than a sustainable solution. Critics argue relocation does not address root causes: entrenched corruption, agricultural overuse, or weak environmental institutions. As noted by an environmental analyst cited in The Guardian (2025), 'If the governance model stays the same, Iran will simply build another future crisis in a different location.' Tehran\u2019s crisis serves as a global warning: urban survival in the 21st century depends not on political power but on ecological humility. Major cities like Mexico City, Cape Town, and Jakarta face similar threats, underscoring that water scarcity becomes catastrophic not from drought alone, but from governmental denial and delayed adaptation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@krisnadana1997/tehrans-water-bankruptcy-a-capital-city-dying-of-political-blindness-67fa2c0bd095)\n\n**Megalopolis with 18 Million Inhabitants Faces Environmental Collapse and May Be Evacuated**\nTeher\u00e3, the capital of Iran with approximately 18 million people in its metropolitan area, is on the brink of environmental collapse due to a severe drought that has persisted for six years. Authorities warn that the city may become uninhabitable within weeks if rainfall does not return. All major reservoirs, including the Amir Kabir Dam\u2014the largest\u2014have reached critically low levels: the dam now holds only 10% of its capacity, down from 86 million cubic meters last year, sufficient for only a few more weeks of supply. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, stated that if rain does not return by year\u2019s end, the government may have to implement strict rationing and, as a last resort, evacuate the city. Water shortages are already evident: residents report dry taps at night, and some areas have no water for hours or days. Experts attribute the crisis not only to climate change and a century\u2019s worst drought but also to decades of poor water management, including over-extraction of aquifers, excessive irrigation, construction of numerous dams, and inadequate infrastructure. The result is a 'water bankruptcy'\u2014surface reserves depleted, aquifers exhausted, and recovery unlikely even with heavy rainfall. Urban sprawl, population growth, and unequal water consumption have further strained a system already operating at maximum capacity. The crisis risks triggering internal migration, social tensions, and economic disruption across agriculture, industry, and public services. While the government has announced the possibility of evacuation, experts believe this is a warning rather than a feasible plan due to the immense logistical, infrastructural, and financial challenges. Instead, the government is likely to implement strict rationing, scheduled water cuts, public conservation campaigns, industrial and domestic usage restrictions, and cloud seeding\u2014though the latter\u2019s effectiveness remains scientifically disputed. The situation in Teher\u00e3 reflects a global trend: megacities in arid regions are increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts intensified by climate change and unsustainable development. Experts stress the urgent need for long-term reforms, including rational water governance, agricultural restructuring, investment in sanitation and water recycling, and equitable access policies to prevent Teher\u00e3 from becoming a precedent of urban collapse.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 07:04 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/agenda-verde/megalopole-com-18-milhoes-de-habitantes-esta-a-beira-do-colapso-ambiental-e-pode-ser-evacuada/)\n\n**Iran's president calls for moving its drought-stricken capital amid a worsening water crisis - how Tehran got into water bankruptcy**\nIran's capital, Tehran, is facing an imminent 'Day Zero'\u2014a point at which the city could run out of water\u2014due to one of the worst droughts in decades. According to the article, rainfall has been severely below normal since 2020, with Fall 2025 being the hottest and driest on record since 1979. Key reservoirs are nearly dry, and groundwater reserves are under extreme stress. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has revived the long-debated plan to relocate the capital, framing it as a necessity rather than an option, warning that Tehran could become uninhabitable if no action is taken.

Despite efforts like the Taleqan-to-Tehran water transfer, such interbasin transfers have often fueled unsustainable growth rather than conservation. Experts, including former officials and water scientists, argue that relocating the capital is unlikely to solve the core issue of population-driven demand. Instead, they advocate for systemic reforms: shifting to less water-intensive agriculture, importing water-intensive crops, improving urban water conservation, expanding wastewater recycling, and investing in aquifer recharge and desalination.

President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that if rain does not arrive by December 2025, residents may need to evacuate, though experts deem this unfeasible due to economic hardship and lack of infrastructure. Main reservoirs supplying Tehran are critically low: Latyan Dam is at 9%, Amir Kabir Dam at 8%, and Sefidrud Dam near Manjil is nearly dry. Similar shortages plague Mashhad, where water levels are at only 3%. The crisis, described as 'water bankruptcy' by Kaveh Madani of the UN University, stems from decades of over-extraction, aging leaky infrastructure (with 30% of treated water lost to leaks), climate change, and water-intensive policies, including food self-sufficiency goals that have doubled irrigated farmland since 1979. Around 90% of Iran\u2019s water is used for agriculture, particularly thirsty crops like rice. Dams and wells have dried up Lake Urmia, once one of the world\u2019s largest saltwater lakes. Iran has endured six consecutive years of drought, a phenomenon unprecedented in modern times, with climate change identified as a key driver by the World Weather Attribution network. Despite cloud seeding and emergency public holidays to encourage temporary evacuations, experts stress that even if rains come, recovery will be impossible due to irreversible ecological damage. The crisis is not just environmental but increasingly intertwined with Iran\u2019s social and political future, with officials now relying on prayers for rain as a symbolic gesture. Long-term solutions require economic diversification away from water-intensive sectors, but such reforms are politically risky and unlikely to be implemented in time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 10:11 AM\nSource:[CNN International](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/01/climate/iran-water-crisis-evacuate-tehran)\n\n**Iran&#x27;s president says capital must move from Tehran over ecological concerns**\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has stated that Tehran's capital status is ecologically unsustainable due to severe water shortages and overcrowding, with the city's population reaching 9.7 million. Speaking in Qazvin, Pezeshkian emphasized that relocating the capital is no longer optional, citing ongoing drought and poor water management as critical factors. His government has proposed the underdeveloped Makran region in southeastern Iran as a potential new capital site. Pezeshkian noted that budget constraints previously prevented relocation, but now the move is unavoidable. Environmental experts, including Hassan Akhani, have warned for years that Tehran's ecological limits have been exceeded, stating 'there is nothing more we can do' as authorities ignored repeated warnings. Tehran's water supply relies on dams (normally providing 70%) and groundwater, but low rainfall and increased evaporation have reduced dam levels and strained underground reserves.

Experts warn the move may not resolve the underlying 10 million-person city's water crisis, as over-extraction of groundwater since 2008 has caused aquifers to deplete rapidly\u2014losing about 1.7 billion cubic meters annually\u2014and triggered land subsidence at over 35 centimeters per year. The crisis evokes 'Day Zero' scenarios seen in Cape Town, Mexico City, Jakarta, and parts of California. While Pezeshkian's decision marks the first official proposal to relocate a capital due to ecological disaster, experts like Cornell University's Linda Shi caution that such moves are often politically motivated, with climate change used as a convenient excuse to deflect responsibility. According to Foreign Policy and the Free Iran Scholars Network, corruption and state-linked\u5229\u76ca groups, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), play a central role in unregulated well drilling, illegal water projects, and unequal water distribution. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) reports that IRGC-affiliated construction firms enjoy privileged access to water infrastructure projects, exacerbating systemic mismanagement and inequity.

Tehran, home to about ten million people and consuming nearly a quarter of Iran\u2019s water, is sinking due to depleted aquifers caused by prolonged drought, rising evaporation, and over-pumping of groundwater. Last year\u2019s rainfall was only 140 millimeters\u2014well below the 260-millimeter standard\u2014while this year\u2019s conditions are similarly dire. The city\u2019s dams, once supplying 70% of its water, now yield significantly less. As aquifers collapse, the land is sinking, accelerating the crisis. Pezeshkian stated, 'We no longer have a choice,' emphasizing that 'ignoring [the environment] means signing our own destruction.' This marks the first time in modern history that a capital move is driven by ecological survival rather than political or military reasons. The proposed relocation to the Makran coast, a region described as 'very prosperous and advanced,' faces immense logistical and financial challenges, with estimated costs between $77 billion and $100 billion. Two national councils are assessing the feasibility of building new coastal cities. However, the region offers limited fresh water and extreme heat, complicating long-term viability. Meanwhile, agriculture and industry account for the majority of water consumption\u2014over 90%\u2014despite government calls for a 20% household reduction. The crisis disproportionately impacts Iran\u2019s poor. Pezeshkian warned, 'Development without considering the impact on resources and expenditures will result in nothing but destruction.' Tehran, capital since 1786, now symbolizes a city that has outgrown its environment. As the ground sinks and water sources vanish, the nation faces an uncertain future: whether the relocation will succeed in time or leave millions behind in a dying capital.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[ZME Science & Technology](https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/environmental-issues/environmental-collapse-is-forcing-iran-to-move-its-capital/)\n\n**Iran&#x2019;s Capital Is Moving.

The president stated, 'We no longer have a choice,' citing decades of unsustainable groundwater extraction for urban and agricultural use, which has led to irreversible land subsidence. According to geoscientist Dar\u00edo Solano, Iran's central plateau is sinking at a rate of over 35 centimeters per year, causing aquifers to lose approximately 1.7 billion cubic meters of water annually due to permanent ground compression. This irreversible damage has severely compromised water storage capacity. As a result, Iranian officials are considering relocating the capital to the southern coast, though experts emphasize this proposal does not alleviate the immediate suffering of nearly 10 million residents in Tehran who are already experiencing the consequences of the water crisis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 08:52 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

Traditional water sources\u201470% from dams and 30% from underground aquifers\u2014are no longer sufficient. Transporting water to Tehran could cost up to \u20ac4 per cubic meter. Pezeshkian reiterated that he had previously raised the issue with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, despite past criticism, and now insists on a scientific, long-term strategy. He highlighted the strategic advantages of southern regions like Hormozgan, including access to the sea, trade potential, and economic development. The idea of relocating the capital is not new; former President Hassan Rouhani had previously developed plans, though they were never implemented.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 04:05 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/tegeran-mezhi-visnazhennya-prezident-iranu-1759550330.html)\n\n**Iran's President Proposes Relocating Capital from Tehran Due to Water Crisis**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has proposed relocating the capital from Tehran to the southern region of Hormozgan, citing an escalating water crisis, severe groundwater subsidence, and unsustainable urban expansion. Tehran, with over 10 million residents, consumes nearly a quarter of Iran\u2019s total water supply. Pezeshkian stated that the country has no alternative but to relocate the capital, emphasizing that the current situation is unsustainable. He highlighted that rainfall in the past year was only 140 mm\u201450-60% below the 260 mm norm\u2014and projected rainfall for 2025 to be just under 100 mm. The decline in dam levels, drying wells, and rising water transport costs\u2014up to \u20ac4 per cubic meter\u2014underscore the urgency. Tehran\u2019s water supply, previously 70% from dams and 30% from groundwater, is now under extreme strain due to reduced precipitation and increased evaporation. Pezeshkian warned that unchecked development without resource consideration leads to inevitable collapse, noting that in some areas, the ground sinks by 30 cm annually\u2014a 'catastrophe' signaling the depletion of underground water. He made these remarks during a visit to Hormozgan, a coastal province on the Persian Gulf, which he described as offering access to open waters and strong economic potential. The proposal, previously discussed by past presidents including Hassan Rouhani, has drawn criticism but is now deemed necessary due to the severity of the crisis. According to The Guardian, the idea has been under consideration for years, with Rouhani even developing relocation plans.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 06:14 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/world/55401782-prezident-irana-predlozhil-perenesti-stolitsu-iz-tegerana/)\n\n**Iran President: Water Crisis Forces 'No Choice' to Relocate Capital from Tehran**\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated on October 2, 2024, during a speech in Hormozgan Province, a coastal region along the Persian Gulf, that Tehran must be relocated due to worsening water shortages, urban overexpansion, and severe land subsidence. He emphasized that the country has 'no choice' but to shift its capital, citing that the current water crisis is not easily solvable. Pezeshkian noted that last year's rainfall was only 140 mm, a 50%\u201360% drop from the standard 260 mm, and that this year\u2019s situation remains dire. He highlighted that water reservoir levels are declining, wells are drying up, and transporting water to Tehran costs up to \u20ac4 per cubic meter (approximately CNY 33.2). He also warned that in some areas, the ground is sinking by 30 cm annually\u2014a 'disaster' indicating the depletion of underground water. Tehran, with over 10 million residents, consumes nearly a quarter of Iran\u2019s total water resources. Pezeshkian reiterated that climate change, over-extraction of groundwater, and poor water management have intensified the crisis. He previously warned in July that if water conservation is not improved, Tehran\u2019s reservoirs could dry up by October. While past Iranian leaders have considered relocating the capital to the Persian Gulf region due to better water availability, Pezeshkian is the first to declare the move 'inevitable.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 05:02 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8n9DY68T1ul)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the probability that Iran will announce a specific new capital location before January 3, 2026, is judged as higher than at any prior time, due to the unprecedented severity of Tehran's water crisis and escalating official rhetoric, but still below even odds due to Iran's history of policy inertia, elite resistance, logistical/financial barriers, and the lack (so far) of a formal, specific declaration. Multiple experts\u2014drawing on urban planning, public administration, political science, regime stability, and Middle East studies\u2014note the existential ecological threat and pressure for decisive regime action as strong factors increasing the likelihood of an announcement. Several also highlight the current president's rhetoric, including specific mentions of Makran or Hormozgan as candidate sites, as raising the possibility that a symbolic but official announcement could be made even if actual implementation is distant or uncertain. Still, all emphasize that base rates for such announcements are very low, that prior Iranian governments have repeatedly floated the idea without follow-through or explicit site naming, and that any such move would require at least tacit Supreme Leader approval. Across nine expert assessments, final probabilities cluster in the 22\u201337% range, with weighted average around one-third, reflecting a risk materially elevated by the present crisis but not yet dominant over the deeper institutional and political obstacles. The most likely scenario remains continued management of the crisis through short-term measures and vague rhetoric, with an official, location-naming announcement possible but still less likely than not in the remaining month to resolution.",
