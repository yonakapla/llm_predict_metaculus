You rightly point out that persistent capital accumulation and technological advancement produce steady, positive trends in global average wealth per adult, only interrupted by rare crisis years. This aligns with historical wealth data and is buttressed by 2024's asset price performance, especially in equities and real estate in major wealth centers. You further demonstrate how variations in smaller or emergent economies, while newsworthy, are arithmetically less impactful for the global average than changes in top-weighted countries\u2014consistent with both asset pricing and economic growth models. Your recognition of the rarity of global contractions (outside events like 2022) and the proper conditionality around data publication risk yield a well-calibrated and theoretically sound probability.

Your reasoning also smartly highlights potential technical uncertainties (statistical adjustments or publication timing), which is a nuanced addition often missed by forecasts focused only on substantive outcomes.

The critiques and defenses across fields further clarify that both theory and evidence support a positive outcome, with only technical uncertainties or WID-specific data nuances left as plausible risks. None of the deliberation surfaced any substantive new downside risks or evidence challenging the strong positive base case. Therefore, no revision downward is warranted.

Five Midwestern states\u2014Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin\u2014experienced statistically significant decreases in inequality, while North Carolina saw a significant increase. State economists explain the changes: North Carolina\u2019s growth in high\u2011pay tech jobs and the end of post\u2011pandemic wage spikes in lower\u2011pay service roles, South Dakota\u2019s stronger income growth among lower and middle brackets, and Nebraska\u2019s high employment across demographics. In Massachusetts, sluggish growth in high\u2011pay life\u2011science and tech jobs has both raised per\u2011capita income and widened inequality.\n\nDemographically, the U.S. became more diverse: the non\u2011Hispanic white population fell from 57.1\u202f% to 56.3\u202f%, Asian residents rose from 6.0\u202f% to 6.3\u202f%, and Hispanic residents increased from 19.4\u202f% to 20.0\u202f%. The Black and American Indian/Alaska Native populations remained unchanged at 12.1\u202f% and 1.0\u202f% respectively. Marriage rates declined: men who have never married grew from 37.2\u202f% to 37.6\u202f%, and women from 31.6\u202f% to 32.1\u202f%.\n\nHousing mobility also dropped: only 11\u202f% of residents moved in 2024 versus 11.3\u202f% in 2023, continuing a decade\u2011long decline driven by rising home\u2011ownership and rental costs. Median monthly mortgage payments climbed to $2,035 from $1,960, with California ($3,001), Hawaii ($2,937), New Jersey ($2,797), Massachusetts ($2,755), and the District of Columbia ($3,181) reporting the highest costs. Median rent with utilities increased from $1,448 to $1,487.\n\nThe survey, covering 3.5\u202fmillion households, provides a comprehensive snapshot of U.S. life, noting that 'Income inequality dipped' and that 'fewer people moved' amid rising housing costs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[WKMG](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/national/2025/09/11/income-inequality-dipped-and-fewer-people-moved-according-to-largest-survey-of-us-life/)\n\n**UK Beats U.S. For Cross-Border Investment  --  And Offices Lead The Way**\nAccording to Colliers\u2019 first\u2011half Global Capital Flows report, the UK was the top global destination for cross\u2011border capital in the 12 months to June, with office assets at the centre of that activity. Europe, the Middle East and Africa is the only region where office investment has overtaken multifamily and industrial, marking a decisive break from global trends. Spain and Italy outperformed their five\u2011year averages, while the Netherlands lagged, highlighting uneven recovery across the region. The UK also ranked third globally as a source of investment, contributing 9.5% of cross\u2011border flows in H1, behind only the U.S. and Canada. Global fundraising totals hit $111\u202fB in the first half, or 85% of 2024\u2019s full\u2011year level. In Europe, allocations have concentrated on the office and industrial sectors; the multifamily sector showed early strength in the first quarter, and data centres attracted 35% of new funds raised, significantly above the 15% average from 2020 to 2024. Monetary policy has added momentum: the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate held at 2% in July, meeting ECB targets, while UK inflation rose to 3.8%. The Bank of England recently cut rates by 25 basis points, yet yield spreads in the region remain more attractive than in the U.S. Colliers Head of Research for Global Capital Markets and EMEA Damian Harrington said, 'EMEA's sector dynamics are shifting,' and added that the resurgence of office investment reflects targeted confidence in core assets, while industrial continues to deliver steady returns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[Bisnow](https://www.bisnow.com/london/news/investment/london-offices-lead-out-emea-cross-border-capital-flows-colliers-says-130895)\n\n**Inflation quashed household income gains in 2024, census finds**\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in 2024 was $83,730, a slight but not statistically significant increase from $82,690 in 2023. The richest 10% of households saw a 30% rise in pretax income, from $193,700 to $251,000. Black households experienced a 3.3% decline in median income, while Asian and Hispanic households grew about 5%, and white households remained unchanged.

The Gini index, measuring income inequality, did not change significantly from last year. Poverty remained largely unchanged at 10.6%. More than 7\u202fmillion Americans were pushed into poverty by medical expenses in 2024. The report also noted that inflation offset income gains, leaving most households' real income steady.

The official poverty rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 10.6%, with 35.9\u202fmillion people in poverty. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) was 12.9%, unchanged from 2023, and Social Security moved 28.7\u202fmillion individuals out of SPM poverty. Median income rose 5.1\u202f% for Asian households and 5.5\u202f% for Hispanic households, while it fell 3.3\u202f% for Black households; income inequality (Gini) and the 10th\u2011 and 50th\u2011percentile incomes remained stable. Among full\u2011time, year\u2011round workers, median earnings increased 3.7\u202f% for men, unchanged for women, and the female\u2011to\u2011male earnings ratio dropped to 80.9\u202f%. Post\u2011tax median household income rose 1.8\u202f% to $72,330, and post\u2011tax Gini was 8.7\u202f% lower than pre\u2011tax.

The real median household income was $83,730 in 2024, statistically unchanged from $82,690 in 2023. Income gains varied by race: Asian households rose 5.1%, Hispanic households 5.5%, while Black households declined 3.3%. National median incomes were $121,700 for Asians, $92,530 for non\u2011Hispanic whites, $70,950 for Hispanics, and $56,020 for Blacks. Men\u2019s full\u2011time, year\u2011round median earnings increased 3.7% to $71,090, whereas women\u2019s earnings ($57,520) remained flat. The Supplemental Poverty Measure reported a 12.9% poverty rate in 2024, unchanged from 2023. The official poverty threshold for a family of four was $31,812, a figure critics say is too low for high\u2011cost regions like Long Island.

Europe, the Middle East and Africa is the only region where office investment has overtaken multifamily and industrial, marking a decisive break from global trends. Spain and Italy outperformed their five\u2011year averages, while the Netherlands lagged, highlighting uneven recovery across the region. The UK also ranked third globally as a source of investment, contributing 9.5% of cross\u2011border flows in H1, behind only the U.S. and Canada. Global fundraising totals hit $111\u202fB in the first half, or 85% of 2024\u2019s full\u2011year level. In Europe, allocations have concentrated on the office and industrial sectors; the multifamily sector showed early strength in the first quarter, and data centres attracted 35% of new funds raised, significantly above the 15% average from 2020 to 2024. Monetary policy has added momentum: the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate held at 2% in July, meeting ECB targets, while UK inflation rose to 3.8%. The Bank of England recently cut rates by 25 basis points, yet yield spreads in the region remain more attractive than in the U.S. Colliers Head of Research for Global Capital Markets and EMEA Damian Harrington said, 'EMEA's sector dynamics are shifting,' and added that the resurgence of office investment reflects targeted confidence in core assets, while industrial continues to deliver steady returns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[Bisnow](https://www.bisnow.com/london/news/investment/london-offices-lead-out-emea-cross-border-capital-flows-colliers-says-130895)\n\n**Inflation quashed household income gains in 2024, census finds**\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in 2024 was $83,730, a slight but not statistically significant increase from $82,690 in 2023. The richest 10% of households saw a 30% rise in pretax income, from $193,700 to $251,000. Black households experienced a 3.3% decline in median income, while Asian and Hispanic households grew about 5%, and white households remained unchanged. Among full\u2011time, year\u2011round workers, women earned 80.9% of what men earned, down from 82.7% the previous year. The Gini index, measuring income inequality, did not change significantly from last year. Poverty remained largely unchanged at 10.6%. More than 7\u202fmillion Americans were pushed into poverty by medical expenses in 2024. The report also noted that inflation offset income gains, leaving most households' real income steady.

It reports that military spending reached 2.7\u202ftrillion\u202fUSD in 2024, a 17\u202f% rise over 2022, and that 78\u202f% of opinion leaders surveyed expect more military conflicts in the next 3\u20135\u202fyears, with 18\u202f% fearing a global war. The report notes a decline in globalisation, as half of exporting firms anticipate a drop in trade flows in 2025, and it points to a shift in power: the number of countries trading more with China than the United\u202fStates rose from 30 to 145 in the last 25\u202fyears. Economic growth is projected to be strongest in Asia, with China at +5\u202f% and India at +6\u202f% GDP growth, compared with +1.9\u202f% for the United\u202fStates and +1\u202f% for the EU. Technological advances, especially AI and humanoid robotics, are seen as potential multipliers of growth, with annual GDP gains that could approach +20\u202f%\u2013+30\u202f%.

New employment is concentrated in construction, trade, and hospitality, but the labour market remains low\u2011productivity and low\u2011wage, with a decline in workers holding a medium\u2011level licence and a rise in graduates. The report concludes that Italy\u2019s economy is returning to a period of declining productivity and that the country\u2019s wealth is increasingly concentrated in financial and real\u2011estate returns rather than labour income.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 12:16 PM\nSource:[Adnkronos](https://www.adnkronos.com/economia/dazi-rapporto-coop-timori-da-conflitti-e-guerre-commerciali_7doScIUhkcqyd0WNagOzhs)\n\n**Taiwan ranks 15th in average wealth per adult | Taiwan News | Sep. 9, 2025 17:04**\nTaiwan has risen to 15th place worldwide in average adult wealth, according to UBS's 2025 Global Wealth Report cited by Taiwan News. The report shows Taiwan's average adult wealth at US$312,075 (NT$9.48\u202fmillion), surpassing South Korea (20th) and Japan (24th). In the same report, North America leads with US$593,000, followed by Oceania at US$497,000 and Western Europe at US$288,000; Switzerland tops the list, the United States ranks second, and Hong\u202fKong comes third at US$601,000. Taiwan also performed strongly on median wealth, with adult median assets of US$114,871, ranking 17th globally and second only to Hong\u202fKong in Asia. The report notes regional disparities: the Americas grew by over 11% in 2024, while Asia\u2011Pacific growth was under 3% and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa recorded less than 0.5%; more than half of the 56 surveyed markets experienced declines in average adult wealth. In local currency terms, Denmark registered the highest real average wealth per adult at nearly 13%, and Taiwan grew by more than 5%.

It cites a shift from a low\u2011interest policy in 2021 to a \u2018high\u2011interest\u2019 trajectory after the 2023 elections, with the policy rate rising from 8.5\u202f% to 50\u202f% in mid\u20112024 and then to 46\u202f% in March\u202f2025, yet inflation remained around 30\u202f% after three years. In 2023 the state paid 28.4\u202fbillion\u202fUSD in interest; the 2024 burden is projected at 1.2\u202ftrillion\u202fTL and 2\u202ftrillion\u202fTL in 2025. Housing rents surged 618\u202f% over three years and bread prices rose 165\u202f%. Unemployment grew from 8.143\u202fmillion in 2023 to 12.3\u202fmillion in 2025, a near\u20114\u202fmillion increase. The nominal minimum wage rose from 11\u202f402\u202fTL in July\u202f2023 to 22\u202f104\u202fTL, but its real value fell to 25\u202f131\u202fTL after inflation, a loss of about 3\u202f000\u202fTL for workers. Consumer\u2011credit volumes jumped 71\u202f% from 1.4\u202ftrillion to 2.4\u202ftrillion\u202fTL, tightening workers\u2019 finances.

The number of people aged 65+ at risk of poverty rose by 1\u202fmillion to 2.6\u202fmillion.

Health coverage data from Cepal show that in 2018 18\u202f% of Mexicans lacked health insurance compared with 24\u202f% in Peru; by 2022 Mexico\u2019s uninsured rate rose to 42\u202f% while Peru\u2019s fell to 14\u202f%. Mexico\u2019s growth was 0.8\u202f% over the last six\u2011year period, versus 1.7\u202f% for Peru; the Banco de M\u00e9xico projects only 0.6\u202f% growth this year. Private investment fell 5\u202f% in Q1\u202f2025 from its Q3\u202f2024 peak, and public investment dropped 24\u202f% because of fiscal constraints. The article cites Tabasco\u2019s growth, driven by public spending on Dos\u202fBocas and the Tren\u202fMaya, which did not enhance the region\u2019s potential growth. It also references Venezuela under Ch\u00e1vez, where poverty fell from 42\u202f% in 2000 to 27\u202f% in 2010 but rose to 93\u202f% in 2020, and Bolivia under Morales, which maintained poverty reductions without private investment in natural resources. The piece argues that real wage increases have improved income distribution, yet productivity remains stagnant and formal employment is declining, with 55\u202f% of the workforce in informal jobs.

The middle\u2011class income band, defined by the OECD as 75\u202f%\u2013200\u202f% of the median, ranged in 2023 from 14\u202f720\u202f\u20ac net per year for a single\u2011person household to 39\u202f260\u202f\u20ac for a two\u2011adult, two\u2011child household. In contrast, the high\u2011class band was 86\u202f837\u202f\u20ac for the same household size. Real incomes for the middle and low classes rose faster than for the high class over the last year and since 2007, with the middle class at 41\u202f225\u202f\u20ac net per year for a two\u2011adult, two\u2011child household. The article attributes this growth to an expanding economic cycle and policies such as a 46.8\u202f% rise in the minimum wage between 2018 and 2023 and pension revaluations linked to inflation. Josep Mestres, economist at CaixaBank Research, notes that real\u2011income growth for a typical four\u2011person household was 4\u202f% for the middle class, 6.9\u202f% for the low class and 2.6\u202f% for the high class between 2007 and 2023, and that the average annual real increase for a middle\u2011class household was only 132\u202f\u20ac per month, describing it as a \u201cvery small advance in living standards.\u201d The article concludes that while Spain\u2019s middle class is expanding, the overall relative position of households is still heavily influenced by housing status and that the European trend of a slightly shrinking middle class contrasts with Spain\u2019s growth.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 03:04 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2025-09-07/pradoja-clase-media-gana-peso-pero-apenas-lo-nota_4203620/)\n\n**HESAP ORTADA - Fato\u015f \u00d6zut K\u0131rtay**\nThe article presents a series of statistics that portray Turkey as lagging behind European Union (EU) countries in several economic and social indicators.

Among the top five European economies, Italy showed the highest real growth in median wealth per adult, at 15%. The lowest growth was seen in the UK, at 5.3%. France (10.3%), Germany (9.5%), and Spain (9%) were in between. Outside of Europe, significant growth was seen in South Korea (13.9%), Australia (10.7%), Canada (9.6%), and Japan (8.6%). The US saw a small growth of 2.3%, while China and Russia saw a notable decline of 6.3% and 8.2% respectively. 'The decline in real median wealth per adult in this period was mainly driven by high inflation in the respective countries, especially in Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as well as in Italy, although to a lesser extent,' the report notes. 'Growth in the number of adults also contributed to this, primarily in the Netherlands and to a lesser extent in Switzerland.' \nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 12:23 AM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/world/world-economy/v-jakikh-krajinakh-jevropi-bahatijut-najshvidshe-rejtinh-ubs-1070718.html)\n\n**US Remains World Leader in Wealth, But Concentration of Wealth Remains a Concern**\nThe United States remains the world's leader in wealth, with over 23.8 million millionaires, representing nearly 40% of the global total, according to a new report by UBS. The country added over 379,000 new millionaires in 2024, with a 1.5% annual increase. China continental came in second, with a 2.3% increase to 6.3 million millionaires. Turkey saw the largest percentage increase, with its millionaire population rising 8.4% to 87,000. The global number of millionaires increased by over 684,000 to nearly 60 million, driven largely by the rise in property values. However, the volatility of the US dollar and commercial uncertainty weigh on the prospects for wealth creation in the US for 2025. UBS economist James Mazeau said, 'It's too early to say if wealth growth in the US will slow down this year.' A weaker dollar could actually boost wealth in countries without dollars. Mazeau also noted that US housing prices have remained resilient and that stocks could end 2025 above current levels. 'This year could be lower than last year, but that doesn't mean we'll see a change in fortune and see negative wealth creation,' he said. 'I don't think the growth engines are dead in the US, not at all.' The wealth remains concentrated, even among the ultra-rich. UBS found that 60 million millionaires worldwide have a combined wealth of $226.47 trillion, nearly half of the world's total wealth. The top 2,860 individuals qualify as ultra-high net worth individuals, controlling $15.7 trillion in assets. The top 15,000 individuals, each with over $100 billion in assets, have a total of $2.4 trillion. Even among the ultra-rich, Mazeau noted, 'We see concentration of wealth or, I'd say, inequality of wealth.' He attributed the concentration to the superior performance of the technology sector and the rise of 'mega tech entrepreneurs.' While the US represents nearly 40% of the world's millionaires, Luxembourg and Switzerland have a higher density of wealth. In both countries, more than one in seven adults has assets worth at least $1 million, according to UBS. Some regions, including Japan, experienced decreases in the number of millionaires, and Japan lost 33,000 due to demographic changes. Meanwhile, Singapore, Qatar, Greece, and Poland significantly increased their ranks, while the wealth of ultra-high net worth individuals fell dramatically in the Netherlands and Uruguay. The 'millionaires of the masses' surpass the ultra-rich in total wealth. UBS emphasized that most wealth gains are occurring at the middle levels. The number of people with between $1 million and $5 million, the so-called 'millionaires of the day,' has quadrupled since 2000 and now stands at around 52 million. Together, they control more wealth than all ultra-high net worth individuals. 'Often, the increase in wealth is overlooked and is directed towards the middle of the herd,' Mazeau said. He added that limited data on those in the range of $50 million to $1 billion distorts public perceptions of wealth inequality. With the expansion of global wealth and the emergence of new trends in asset ownership, UBS expects the composition of the world's rich to continue evolving, even if volatility and policy changes create obstacles along the way.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 19, 2025 01:18 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/es/noticias/2025/06/19/el-numero-mundial-de-millonarios-alcanza-los-60-millones-informa-ubs-hogar-de-ee-uu-para-el-40/)\n\n**Global Wealth Grows 4.6% in 2024, Led by US and China**\nGlobal wealth grew 4.6% in 2024, four-tenths more than in 2023, driven by growth in wealth in America (11%), according to the new UBS report on wealth in major economies. Switzerland again topped the list, followed by the US, which rose to second place. The median wealth per adult citizen rose to $687,166 in Switzerland, while in the US, two places ahead of 2023, it was $620,654, according to a ranking in which Hong Kong again occupied third place and Luxembourg fell two places to fourth. The UK remained in 13th place, with an average wealth of $339,700, France fell to 16th (301,503), Germany to 19th (256,715), and Spain and Italy occupied 22nd and 23rd places, with average wealth of $233,739 and $214,663 respectively. The 16th edition of the report, published by UBS in 2023, noted that despite the overall increase, half of the 56 markets studied experienced a decline in median wealth per adult. In the chapter dedicated to millionaires in the world (almost 60 million with combined assets of $226 billion, according to UBS), it was indicated that the number of people in this situation increased by 1.2% last year, or 684,000 more people with a wealth of over $1 million. Almost 40% of them (23 million, 379,000 more than in 2023) are in the US, while China occupies second place in this ranking, with 6.3 million, followed by France (2.8 million), Japan (2.7 million) and Germany (2.6 million). The UK, also with 2.6 million, is in sixth place, while Italy is ninth (1.3 million), Spain 12th (1.2 million) and in Latin America, both Brazil (433,000) and Mexico (399,000) are among the 25 countries with the most millionaires. According to the study, the largest segment of the population in the world is that of adults with a wealth between $10,000 and $100,000 (1.57 billion people, 41% of the total), which has surpassed for the first time this decade the number of people who do not exceed $10,000 (1.55 billion, 40%). At the top of the pyramid, 2,860 people in the world have wealth between $1,000 and $50,000 million, 16 between $50,000 and $100,000 million, and 15 exceed those $100,000 million. According to the UBS report, global wealth has grown on average 3.4% annually over the past century, although there have been exceptions such as in 2022, when it experienced a decline of 3%. The Swiss bank expects that in the coming years the upward trend will continue, led by the US, China, Latin America and Oceania. The report expects that in the next 20 or 25 years, $83 billion in wealth will be transferred, of which $74 billion will be inherited by descendants and the rest will be transferred horizontally between spouses. The US will lead these transfers, worth $29 billion, followed by Brazil ($9 billion) and China ($5 billion).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 19, 2025 08:47 AM\nSource:[Portafolio.co](https://www.portafolio.co/internacional/la-riqueza-global-crecio-4-6-en-2024-lideran-suiza-y-ee-uu-633375)\n\n**UAE Adds 13,000 New Millionaires in 2024, Bringing Total to 240,343**\nAccording to the 16th edition of the Global Wealth Report 2025 by UBS, the UAE added around 13,000 new millionaires in 2024, bringing the total number of high-net-worth individuals in the country to 240,343. The total wealth of these individuals is estimated to be around $785 billion, with an average wealth of $147,663 per adult. The UAE saw a growth of 5.8% in the number of millionaires in 2024, making it the second-fastest growing market in the world in attracting high-net-worth individuals after Turkey, which saw a growth of 8.4% in the number of millionaires. The report also expects the UAE to see wealth transfer transactions worth $19 billion in the coming period, whether between generations or between spouses, which is equivalent to 1.4% of the country's total private wealth. Globally, wealth saw a growth of 4.6% in 2024, after a growth of 4.2% in 2023, reflecting its continued upward trend. However, the growth rate was uneven. Neil Zelken, Head of Wealth Management for the Middle East at UBS Global Wealth Management, said, 'This year's UBS report highlights the growing role of the Middle East in global wealth dynamics, particularly for the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are seeing an increase in the number of millionaires and a significant growth in average wealth, with the UAE's average wealth increasing by over 23% since 2020. As we expect total wealth transfers of around $122 billion, the two markets are entering a critical phase of intergenerational transfer.' The value of wealth increased significantly in North America, with the Americas accounting for the largest share of the increase, exceeding 11%, due to the stability of the US dollar and the recovery of financial markets. In 2024, adults in North America were the wealthiest, with an average wealth of $593,347, followed by Oceania ($496,696) and Western Europe ($287,688). However, when measured in US dollars and adjusted for inflation, more than half of the 56 markets surveyed did not contribute to the global wealth growth last year, with the average wealth of adults declining significantly. Switzerland continued to lead the list of countries in average wealth per adult, followed by the United States, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Denmark, South Korea, Sweden, Ireland, Poland, and Croatia recorded the highest increases in average wealth, with all of them growing by double-digit numbers (in local currencies). The United States, China, and France had the largest number of millionaires with their wealth valued in US dollars, with the United States accounting for around 40% of the world's millionaires. Over the past 25 years, global wealth has seen a sustained and significant growth, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% since 2000. The report highlights a growing category of millionaires, often overlooked, known as 'daily millionaires' who have investable assets between $1 million and $5 million. The number of these individuals has increased more than four times since 2000, reaching around 52 million people worldwide at the end of last year. A daily millionaire is an individual who has a net worth of $1 million or more, lives a normal life, and has a regular job. It does not require them to be exceptionally wealthy or famous, but rather ordinary people who have achieved this level of wealth through smart financial habits and wise investments. The total value of the wealth of this category is around $107 trillion, and the value of their assets approaches that of individuals with wealth exceeding $5 million, valued at around $119 trillion. The growth of this category is largely due to rising property prices and exchange rate effects. Despite regional differences, the long-term upward trend in the category of daily millionaires is clear worldwide. Over the next 20 to 25 years, it is expected that more than $83 trillion will be transferred, with 9 trillion dollars expected to be transferred horizontally between spouses, and 74 trillion dollars between generations. It is expected that the United States will have the largest wealth transfer transactions (over $29 trillion), followed by Brazil (around $9 trillion), and China (over $5 trillion).\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 18, 2025 08:40 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/economy/business/uae-economy/119311)\n\n**Global Wealth Increases by 4.6% in 2024, According to UBS Report**\nAccording to the UBS Global Wealth Report 2025, global wealth has increased by 4.6% in 2024, driven by a 11% growth in wealth in the Americas.

    "summary": "All experts converge on an extremely high probability that global average wealth per adult increased in 2024 compared to 2023. Drawing upon base rates (which show consistent annual increases aside from major global crises), cross-referenced with the 2024 UBS Global Wealth Report and other news sources, they observe a reported 4.6% global wealth gain\u2014driven especially by the Americas (+11%) and strong performances in the US, Switzerland, Taiwan, and select emerging markets. Key positive factors include robust asset price appreciation (stocks, real estate), stable or strengthening currencies in major markets, and the resilience of key economies. While regional divergence exists\u2014with some large markets like China, Turkey, and Russia posting declines, and over half of tracked markets seeing local decreases in wealth per adult\u2014these negatives are substantially outweighed in the global average by gains in the dominant wealth centers (US, Switzerland, etc.). Experts caution that high inflation and currency effects diminished gains in some regions but did not reverse the global aggregate, as wealth metrics are driven disproportionately by top-performing economies. In all scenarios, only an unreported, catastrophic late-year global shock, major data revision, or non-publication by WID could lead to a 'No' outcome, and no evidence or reporting supports this. As such, final probabilities are uniformly in the 94\u201398% range, with the consensus that if WID publishes data as expected, the answer will almost certainly be Yes.",
