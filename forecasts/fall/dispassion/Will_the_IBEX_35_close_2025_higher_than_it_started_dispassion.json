Technical analysis provides actionable, rule-based models to assess where retracements, corrections, and breakouts are likely and how they align with longer-term cycles, trend support/resistance, corrective risks, and potential exhaustion signals. The IBEX 35 is also a mature, actively traded index where technical factors (trend persistence, momentum, mean reversion, seasonality, etc.) are repeatedly validated in price history.",

Breadth is robust, sector leaders are delivering, and mild macroeconomic tailwinds persist. Market resilience to recent political and geopolitical uncertainties is evident in price action. Using technical patterns and historical analogs, there is only a low probability (~3%-5%) of a full retracement to the starting level, making the probability that IBEX ends above 11,595 extremely high.

Spanish markets, in particular, can be affected disproportionately by pan-European or global shocks, as seen during the European sovereign crisis and COVID-19 selloff, even if Spanish fundamentals then appeared sound. The argument might be strengthened by more explicitly acknowledging the non-negligible tail risk from eurozone systemic factors and global credit/liquidity events, which, though low-probability, do not entirely vanish even in calm environments.

By explicitly referencing portfolio risk practices\u2014centering the forecast near the upper extreme to reflect the very strong status quo evidence but still reserving some allowance for extreme scenarios\u2014this approach avoids both complacency and false certainty. I agree from a European integration perspective: the systemic buffers created by EU institutions, monetary policy, and cross-border coordination greatly diminish (but do not eliminate) the probability of an unanticipated, rapid drawdown of the magnitude required for a No outcome. Their forecast recognizes that even in robust environments, risk cannot be dismissed entirely, a nuance often overlooked when indices are far above a critical threshold. This is prudent and models the type of sober probabilistic thinking essential for high-stakes geopolitical and capital market forecasts."

The fall was largely driven by a sharp correction in the banking sector, with Santander and Sabadell dropping 1.40% and 1.25% respectively, a move that the article describes as \"Los bancos lideran hoy el freno del Ibex\".  Despite the dip, the index still managed to stay near the 15,200\u2011point level, with intraday lows threatening that threshold.  Other Spanish stocks that led the gains were Indra (+3.03%), Redeia (+1.10%) and Enag\u00e1s (+1.02%), while the biggest losers were Grifols (-1.43%), Acciona (-1.36%) and Solaria (-1.24%).  On the global stage, the Dow Jones rose 1.09% with UnitedHealth, Microsoft (+0.72%) and Chevron (+0.70%) as top performers, while the S&P\u202f500 and Nasdaq were largely flat.  The euro slipped 0.12% to 1.1720 against the dollar, supported by U.S. employment data and ECB commentary.  In Asia, the Nikkei set new record highs, climbing 0.93% toward 45,000 points, while China\u2019s CSI\u202f300 fell 0.3%.

The fall was largely driven by a sharp correction in the banking sector, with Santander and Sabadell dropping 1.40% and 1.25% respectively, a move that the article describes as \"Los bancos lideran hoy el freno del Ibex\".  Despite the dip, the index still managed to stay near the 15,200\u2011point level, with intraday lows threatening that threshold.  Other Spanish stocks that led the gains were Indra (+3.03%), Redeia (+1.10%) and Enag\u00e1s (+1.02%), while the biggest losers were Grifols (-1.43%), Acciona (-1.36%) and Solaria (-1.24%).  On the global stage, the Dow Jones rose 1.09% with UnitedHealth, Microsoft (+0.72%) and Chevron (+0.70%) as top performers, while the S&P\u202f500 and Nasdaq were largely flat.  The euro slipped 0.12% to 1.1720 against the dollar, supported by U.S. employment data and ECB commentary.  In Asia, the Nikkei set new record highs, climbing 0.93% toward 45,000 points, while China\u2019s CSI\u202f300 fell 0.3%.

The market is still reacting to the European Central Bank\u2019s decision made the previous day. Investors are also watching Spanish banks: BBVA and Banco Sabadell have been in the news because Sabadell\u2019s board, chaired by Josep Oliu, unanimously rejected the takeover offer from Carlos Torres\u2019s firm, saying the price does not \"adequately\" reflect the intrinsic value of its shares and undervalues the project \"very significantly\". Duro Felguera announced it will consider legal action after the Romanian gas producer Romgaz unilaterally terminated its contract with Iernut. On the macro side, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) held its year\u2011on\u2011year rate at 2.7% in August, as food and electricity prices offset fuel price increases, according to final data from the National Statistics Institute (INE). Early in the session, the biggest gains in the Ibex 35 were Acciona Energ\u00eda (+0.8%) and Puig (+0.69%), while the largest declines were Repsol (\u20110.86%) and Inditex (\u20110.17%).

The index recently broke the 15\u202f180\u2011point resistance, a key level that could open the door to a year\u2011high target of 15\u202f444 points.  Analyst Joan\u202fCabrero of elEconomista.es notes that the current bullish momentum has not fundamentally changed; he expects a market \u201csusto\u201d or correction that would bring the Ibex back to a fertile buying zone.  Cabrero estimates that a decline of 8\u201110\u202f% from the 15\u202f444 peak\u2014placing the index between 14\u202f000 and 13\u202f740 points\u2014would align with the June lows and the 38.2\u202f% Fibonacci retracement of the overall uptrend that began in October\u202f2022.

The index was led by Inditex, which posted a 9\u202f% cumulative gain from August\u202f1 to September\u202f8, surpassing analyst expectations. The largest declines were seen in Puig, still pressured by recent quarterly results and shrinking fragrance margins, and in Grifols, which opened lower amid renewed doubts over the Gotham case and KPMG audits but finished with a 0.5\u202f% rebound. European markets moved higher: the French CAC\u202f40 rose 0.6\u202f%, while Germany\u2019s DAX and the EuroStoxx\u202f50 each gained 0.3\u202f%. BAE\u202fSystems jumped more than 4\u202f% on positive defense\u2011industry outlooks and growing drone interest following tensions in Poland and NATO\u2019s response. In the United States, Wall Street opened higher after employment data showed weekly unemployment claims at their highest level since October\u202f2021, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates. The Nasdaq\u202f100 advanced, led by Micron\u2019s strong AI focus, after Oracle\u2019s prior session. Commodities were negative: gold fell about 0.5\u202f%, oil and natural gas slid roughly 2\u202f%. The euro strengthened slightly against the dollar following Lagarde\u2019s comments and U.S. inflation data. The article quotes Lagarde\u2019s statement that the ECB keeps interest rates unchanged, citing economic resilience and the end of the deflation process: 'El BCE mantiene sin cambios los tipos de inter\u00e9s'.

The ECB\u2019s deposit rate remains at 2%, the main refinancing rate at 2.15%, and the marginal lending facility at 2.40%. In a press conference, ECB President Christine Lagarde announced the end of the disinflationary process and emphasized the institution\u2019s commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% in the medium term. Macro\u2011economic forecasts were slightly revised: the ECB raised its 2024 and 2025 growth estimates by 0.1 percentage point each, while the 2027 estimate was lowered by 0.1 point, leaving inflation at 2.1% for 2024, 1.7% for 2025 and 1.9% for 2027. The ECB also updated its GDP outlook, projecting 1.2% growth in 2025, 1.0% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. In the United States, the August consumer price index rose to 2.9% year\u2011on\u2011year, an increase of 0.2 percentage points from July.

Market performance highlighted Inditex as the top gainers, up 2.66%, while other Spanish stocks such as Ferrovial (+1.07%), Endesa (+1.89%) and Acerinox (+1.69%) also rose. On the downside, Puig fell 1.96%, and Iberdrola, Amadeus, Repsol and Enag\u00e1s all declined. European markets broadly moved higher: London +0.78%, Paris +0.80%, Frankfurt +0.30% and Milan +0.89%.

Technical analyst Joan Cabrero notes that the Ibex 35 \"no encuentra soporte relevante hasta los 14.000-13.740 puntos\" and that a 10\u202f% drop to 14,000 would trigger a medium\u2011term buying zone, \"Los 14.000, adem\u00e1s, act\u00faan como soporte psicol\u00f3gico de primer orden\".

Joan Cabrero, technical analyst for elEconomista.es, warns that until the gap opened on Tuesday is closed above 15,265 and especially above 15,350, the risk of a correction remains high.  In Europe, the EuroStoxx 50 has had two false breakouts at 5,470 and 5,200 points; a new Judas\u2011type breakout could sow doubt.  The index should close above 5,480 to reduce the risk of a deeper correction; otherwise support only exists at 5,150\u20115,200.  Asian markets are mixed: the Nikkei and other Japanese exchanges are in the red, while Chinese and Korean markets finish above their opening levels.

The Spanish stock market is waiting for a trade agreement between the US and the EU on tariffs, with a possible 15% tariff rate, similar to the agreement with Japan. The European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting is also a key reference point today. Analysts at Renta 4 do not expect changes in interest rates due to the 'intensification' of the deflationary process caused by US policies, which has led to a 13% increase in the value of the euro in 2025 and an 8% drop in oil prices. 'The market is discounting a 25-point cut in interest rates for the fourth quarter of 2025, an idea we share and which leads us to think that we are close to the end of the current cycle of rate cuts, unless there is a growth collapse,' said Renta 4 experts. Today, a summit between EU and Chinese leaders is taking place, although 'there are no high expectations' due to trade and geopolitical tensions between the two blocs. However, analysts believe that there could be a positive outcome in trade and defense negotiations between the EU and Japan. In Spain, the presentation of corporate results and the Active Population Survey (EPA) are highlighted. Bankinter has reported a profit of 541.7 million euros in the first half, a 14.4% increase, making it the largest gainer in the index with a 5.35% increase in the mid-session and reaching 12 euros per share. Rovi followed, with a 4.78% increase despite reporting a net profit of 39.7 million euros between January and June, a 10% decrease from the same period in 2024. However, it has confirmed its 2025 forecasts and announced that it has received a 36.3 million euro subsidy for the 'Laisolid' project. Repsol and Acerinox also presented their results, with Repsol reporting a 62.9% decrease in its profit to 603 million euros, and Acerinox reporting net losses of 18 million euros in the first half of the year, compared to the 114 million euros in profit in the same period last year, due to an extraordinary accounting adjustment of 48 million euros due to a deterioration of fiscal credits. Indra reported a net profit of 215 million euros in the first half of the year, an 88.6% increase from the same period last year. Sabadell also presented its results, with a profit of 975 million euros in the first half of the year, a 23.3% increase from the same period in 2024, and announced its new strategic plan for 2025-2027, in which it estimates distributing 6,300 million euros to its shareholders. The EPA reported that unemployment decreased by 236,100 people in the second quarter, a 8.47% decrease from the previous quarter, while employment increased by 503,300 people (+2.31%), reaching over 22 million employed people for the first time. In the Ibex 35, Bankinter and Rovi were followed by Indra (+3.22%), CaixaBank (+3.19%), Repsol (+2.61%), Unicaja (+2.37%), and Grifols (+1.85%) as the largest gainers of the day.

The Spanish stock market is awaiting a trade agreement between the US and the EU on tariffs, with a possible 15% tariff rate, similar to the agreement with Japan. The European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting is also a key reference point today, with analysts at Renta 4 expecting no changes in interest rates due to the intensification of the deflationary process caused by US policies, which has led to a 13% rise in the euro's value this year and an 8% drop in oil prices. 'The market is discounting a further 25 basis point cut for the fourth quarter of 2025, an idea we share and which leads us to think that we are close to the end of the current cycle of rate cuts, unless there is a growth debacle,' said Renta 4 experts. Additionally, a summit between EU and Chinese leaders is taking place today, although 'there are no high expectations' due to trade and geopolitical tensions between the two blocs. However, analysts believe that there could be a positive outcome in trade and defense negotiations between the EU and Japan. In Spain, the presentation of corporate results and the Active Population Survey (EPA) are notable. Bankinter has reported a profit of 541.7 million euros in the first half, up 14.4% year-on-year, making it the top performer in the index with a 5.35% increase in the mid-session and reaching 12 euros per share. Rovi followed, with a 4.78% increase despite reporting a net profit of 39.7 million euros between January and June, 10% lower than the same period in 2024. However, it has confirmed its 2025 forecasts and announced that it has received a 36.3 million euro subsidy for a beneficiary project, 'Laisolid'. Repsol reported a 62.9% drop in its profit in the semester, to 603 million euros, while Acerinox reported net losses of 18 million euros in the first half of the year, compared to the 114 million euros in profit in the same period last year, due to an extraordinary accounting adjustment due to a deterioration of fiscal credits of 48 million euros due to the poor behavior of the European market. Indra reported a net profit of 215 million euros in the first half of the year, up 88.6% from the same period last year. Sabadell has reported its results for the first half of the year, with a profit of 975 million euros, up 23.3% from the same period in 2024, and also presented its new strategic plan for the period 2025-2027, in which it estimates distributing 6,300 million euros to its shareholders. Regarding the EPA, the INE has reported that unemployment fell by 236,100 people in the second quarter, representing an 8.47% decrease from the previous quarter, while employment increased by 503,300 people (+2.31%), exceeding 22 million employed for the first time.

The absence of news in trade negotiations and the confusion over the future of Fed Chairman Powell contributed to investor doubts. The domestic indicator managed to mitigate the declines in the final trading session, maintaining the 14,000 points level. The Ibex 35 lost 0.07% to 14,041.5 units, with energy stocks leading the gains, including Solaria Energ\u00eda (+6.60%), Acciona Energ\u00eda (+2.97%), Naturgy (+1.25%), and Enag\u00e1s (+1.08%). However, declines were led by Puig (-2.33%), IAG (-2.21%), and Indra (-1.43%). BBVA (-0.59%) closed lower after postponing the acceptance period for the Sabadell takeover offer. Other European markets experienced general declines, with the EuroStoxx 50 falling 1% below 5,300 points, and the Dax 40 German index losing over 1% to 24,000 points. According to Joan Cabrero, analyst at Ecotrader, the Ibex 35 'consolidated positions between the resistance zone of 14,360-14,275 points and the support of 13,700 points' last week. Cabrero notes that if the indicator 'does not lose the support of 13,600-13,700 points', the consolidation can be seen as 'a classic digestion of the previous rise' of the Ibex 35, which reached 14,360 points. 'The loss of the support of 13,600-13,700 points would mark the beginning of a correction.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 03:56 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/flash/20250722/62925/)\n\n**Ibex 35 Rises 0.14% at Opening, Spanish Economy Grows 0.6% in Q1**\nThe Ibex 35 index has started the session with a 0.14% increase, reaching 14,054.6 points at 9:00 am. This comes as the Spanish economy grew 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, a tenth less than in the previous quarter, and moderated its annual advance by five tenths, from 3.3% to 2.8%. The NATO leaders are meeting in The Hague to discuss defense spending for the next decade, with all countries expected to commit to the new 5% GDP spending threshold, as requested by US President Donald Trump, despite opposition from Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Additionally, the US has announced the reopening of its embassy in Jerusalem after closing it on Wednesday due to the conflict between Israel and Iran. In the Spanish business sector, Banco Sabadell has announced that it is in the final stages of preparing its new strategic plan, which will be presented on July 24. The main gains in the Ibex 35 were led by Fluidra (+1.43%) and Ferrovial (+1.42%), while the most significant declines were seen in Cellnex (-0.57%) and Endesa (-0.29%).

This comes after the index closed on Monday at 14,199 points, just below the 14,200 mark. According to the Ministry of Labor, the registered unemployment rate decreased by 57,835 people in May, a 2.3% drop. However, indefinite hiring decreased by 4% and temporary hiring increased by 1.6%.

Despite commercial tensions and economic evolution, the European reference indices have been consuming time in recent sessions, alleviating the overbuying derived from the last strong rises and showing signs of strength. According to Joan Cabrero, technical analyst and strategist at Ecotrader, 'it is likely that we will see another bullish segment at any moment.' In the case of the Ibex 35, this movement could lead the Spanish selectivity to seek the ceiling of the channel that has been guiding the rises in recent years, specifically since 2022. 'Currently, after the last consolidation, the ceiling of this channel is near 14,750 points, but if it takes a bit more time, it could reach 15,000 points,' highlights the expert. This situation, combined with the expectation of a negative start to the day on Wall Street, would increase the accumulated profitability advantage of the Spanish selectivity over the S&P 500 since the beginning of the year. In the last sessions, there has been an increase in the advantage of the Ibex 35 over the Yankee index, with a difference of 24 points in accumulated performance since January. In Europe, the EuroStoxx 50 has been within the line of the vela of May 23 for six sessions, which was the last day when the bears tried to take control and put the rebound of the last weeks at risk, Cabrero says. The expert of Ecotrader indicates that this movement 'is more a sign of strength than weakness.' Cabrero also states that it would surprise him if there were a significant fall in the continental index without the main European reference having at least reached its previous highs of the year, implying an additional potential of 4-5% from the current levels.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 04:44 AM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/13395380/06/25/ibex-35-en-cualquier-momento-podamos-asistir-a-otro-segmento-alcista.html)\n\n**Ibex 35 Maintains 14,300 Points Amid Economic Optimism**\nThe Ibex 35 index opened the session on Wednesday with a 0.1% increase, reaching 14,338.2 points at 9:15 am. Investors are waiting for the European Central Bank's (ECB) non-monetary policy meeting and its financial stability report. The main indicator of the Spanish market remained at its January 2008 highs, after a nine-session winning streak, its best consecutive gains since August 2022.

BBVA's president, Carlos Torres, argued that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Enterprise should not raise the operation to buy Banco Sabadell at the Council of Ministers, as there are no issues of general interest arising from the transaction. Mapfre's solvency ratio II was 205.6% at the end of the first quarter, slightly below the figure at the end of 2024 (207.4%).

    "summary": "All experts, across diverse specializations\u2014technical and fundamental equity analysis, portfolio and risk management, various macroeconomic schools, finance (including EMH, behavioral, asset pricing), and Iberian political economy\u2014converge on an overwhelmingly high probability that the IBEX 35 will close 2025 above its starting value of 11,595. Their assessments are grounded in the index\u2019s current level (~15,300 in mid-September, more than 32% above the threshold), robust Spanish and Eurozone economic fundamentals, solid bank and corporate earnings (notably Inditex and major banks), supportive (or at least non-restrictive) monetary policy from the ECB and Fed, and generally positive global risk appetite. All experts note that even a significant correction (10\u201315%) would leave the IBEX comfortably above 11,595, with only an extreme tail event\u2014such as a 2008-style global crisis, sovereign/default-induced shock, or major geopolitical escalation\u2014posing a real threat to a No resolution. Historical base rates overwhelmingly support a Yes: developed index drawdowns exceeding 24% in one quarter are exceedingly rare outside true system-wide crises. Minor headwinds or corrections are accounted for, but none see credible evidence of an imminent, sufficiently severe downturn. Exactly one expert modestly softens their forecast to the mid-90% range to acknowledge mean reversion risk, but most are at 97\u201399%. The group\u2019s consensus thus assigns a very high probability (96\u201399%) that the IBEX 35 will end 2025 above 11,595, with a Yes outcome overwhelmingly likely barring an unprecedented negative shock.",
