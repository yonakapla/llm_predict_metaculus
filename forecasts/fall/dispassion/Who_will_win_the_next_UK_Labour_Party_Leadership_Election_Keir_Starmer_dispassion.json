At present, none of the named alternatives (Burnham, Mahmood, Powell, Streeting) are positioned to force a contest, and Burnham is not even an MP. The deputy leadership race, while a potential barometer of party sentiment, is not a direct challenge. Unless Starmer himself resigns or is implicated in a sudden, overwhelming scandal, he is overwhelmingly likely to win the next leadership election (should one happen in the foreseeable future). I assess the probability that Starmer will win the next Labour leadership election at 87%. This is not 100%, as the polling collapse, left-wing discontent, and possibility of a shock event introduce some risk, but the weight of procedural, cultural, and historical factors remains strongly in his favour.",

The main obstacles to Starmer are poor polling and the rise of Reform UK, which could lead to panic if Labour appears to be heading for a catastrophic midterm defeat. However, no credible challenger is currently positioned to take over: Andy Burnham is not an MP, and other names lack both the broad support and organizational machinery to mount a serious challenge. Even with growing left-wing and Burnham-aligned agitation, procedural inertia, lack of consensus on a replacement, and the practical difficulty of organizing a successful challenge suggest Starmer is still the favourite to win the next Labour leadership election, should one occur in the short-to-medium term.

Key leadership model factors\u2014such as the high procedural barriers to challenge, the lack of an immediate existential crisis, and the inertia favouring incumbents\u2014point strongly toward Starmer remaining leader. The deputy leadership race is not a direct threat to his leadership. The most plausible threat, Andy Burnham, cannot stand without first becoming an MP, and even then, his pathway is procedurally and politically complex. Thus, the probability that Keir Starmer wins the next Labour Party leadership election\u2014if one occurs before the question closes\u2014is very high. However, I discount slightly for the possibility of an unexpected scandal or rapid realignment, as well as the current unusually poor polling, which might eventually force a crisis. Overall, the odds are extremely strong in favour of Starmer winning the next leadership election, either by default or via a win.",

My own critique and the group consensus suggest my 80% probability remains well-calibrated, but given the slight upward tilt in most peer forecasts and the robustness of status quo mechanisms, I am marginally increasing my probability.",

However, critiques from both factional and party electoral college perspectives emphasize that the risk of rapid elite realignment is slightly higher than pure historical precedent would suggest. The deputy leadership contest and visible signs of elite maneuvering (notably Burnham's positioning and open left-wing dissent) are meaningful risk factors, especially if Labour's polling and local election results continue to deteriorate. Elite Circulation Theory allows for sudden shifts when elite confidence collapses, and cues from the group suggest this risk, while still subdominant, is non-negligible in the current volatile context. Accordingly, I will modestly revise my probability downward to better reflect the increased risk of a rapid realignment, while maintaining that Starmer remains the strong favorite.",

Most forecasters\u2014across politics, political science, and sociology\u2014emphasize the extreme inertia provided by procedural rules, incumbency, and network fragmentation within the PLP and NEC. The lowest probability offered (72%) appears to overweight short-term volatility given the lack of a viable, unifying challenger and the practical obstacles to mounting a successful challenge. Critiques of higher probabilities (in the 87\u201393% range) point to the genuine, non-trivial risk of rapid change if polling collapses further or a scandal erupts, but consistently acknowledge that elite coordination and network coherence are not yet present. My own critique also stands: network fragmentation and procedural hurdles are strong stabilizers. Therefore, I see no compelling reason to move my probability significantly. However, in light of the repeated, credible acknowledgment of 'elevated but subdominant' risk and the possibility of cascading elite realignment if conditions worsen, I will slightly lower my probability to 82%, reflecting a modest tilt toward caution, but still prioritizing the status quo.",

Net Zero sceptic Jeremy Clarkson hints he could take on Ed Miliband at next election | Daily Mail Online**\nJeremy Clarkson, a prominent critic of the Labour Government and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, has hinted he may challenge Ed Miliband, the Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary, in the next UK general election. Clarkson, who was born in Miliband\u2019s Doncaster North constituency, questioned the satisfaction of local voters with their MP and suggested he could run as an independent candidate. Miliband has held the seat since 2005, winning with a 2,370-vote majority in 2019, aided by a split in the right-wing vote between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party. Clarkson has previously expressed interest in politics, notably posting on Twitter in 2013 about potentially standing for Doncaster North. He has voiced strong support for the Conservative Party, praising their 'common sense' at the 2025 Manchester conference and criticizing both Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for economic inconsistencies and Sir Keir Starmer for allegedly damaging the economy through excessive regulation and taxation. Clarkson has also opposed Labour\u2019s Net Zero policies, which Miliband leads. The article notes that Miliband could face electoral risk if Labour continues to lag in the polls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15187011/Bet-farm-Net-Zero-sceptic-Jeremy-Clarkson-hints-Ed-Miliband-election.html)\n\n**UK: Starmer Under Pressure, Farage at Polling High**\nThe Labour Party won the UK parliamentary elections in 2024 with a clear victory, but Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces significant criticism over a year later. Despite the electoral success, the government is accused of breaking campaign promises. The Conservative Party, having lost power, is struggling to survive politically. Meanwhile, the right-wing populist Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has led opinion polls for months. This political shift is attributed to the Labour government's perceived failure to deliver on key pledges, the Conservatives' weakened position, and the rising popularity of Farage's party, which has capitalized on public concerns over migration and political dissatisfaction.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[Deutschlandfunk](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/grossbritannien-politik-krise-labour-reform-uk-100.html)\n\n**PM 'has confidence' in national security chief after China spying case**\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed 'full confidence' in his national security chief, Jonathan Powell, despite growing political backlash over the collapse of the trial against Chris Cash and Christopher Berry, who were accused of passing secrets to China between 2021 and 2023. The trial ended with both men being formally declared not guilty, and the Crown Prosecution Service stated that the government had failed to provide evidence that China posed a national security threat during the alleged offences\u2014despite repeated requests. Starmer insists no minister, including Powell, was involved in the decision, attributing the lack of evidence to the previous Conservative government\u2019s stance at the time. However, former officials have questioned the sudden shift in position, and the Conservative Party has criticized Powell, citing his frequent visits to China and advocacy for stronger UK-China ties. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp demanded urgent explanation for the government\u2019s failure to disclose evidence showing China was a threat during 2021\u20132023. Cabinet minister Bridget Phillipson confirmed Starmer\u2019s confidence in Powell during a Sky News interview. Powell has agreed to appear before the national security strategy committee, though the session will be held behind closed doors. Additionally, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is seeking legal advice on mounting a private prosecution against the two men on alternative charges, such as theft of data or unauthorized access to Parliament, under different statutes.

Despite initial momentum, Starmer faces mounting criticism from unnamed 'insiders' and party figures, who question his judgment, communication skills, and leadership style, describing him as 'too like a chairman, not a chief executive' and lacking 'emotional connection' with the public. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg reported in late September 2025 that 30 unnamed sources across government and the party were consulted to assess Starmer\u2019s political peril, highlighting widespread concerns over his 'flawed' personnel decisions and policy communication. Media magnification is cited as a key factor in eroding Starmer\u2019s appeal, which was never particularly strong to begin with. Concerns are heightened by the surge of Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which gained 677 councillors in May 2025 and was projected by YouGov to win 311 seats in a hypothetical election, based on a 13,000-person sample. By early October, Reform UK polled at 31%, while Labour trailed at 21%. The article notes that the UK\u2019s First Past the Post system often suppresses challengers, but the current political climate has intensified fears of a Labour collapse. At Labour\u2019s Liverpool party conference, Starmer delivered a 'full-throated defence of progressive values,' with unnamed senior figures praising his 'emotional connection' and 'scrappiness.' Despite this, speculation about a leadership challenge persists, with Andy Burnham and Shabana Mahmood cited as potential contenders. Starmer\u2019s defenders include Fraser Nelson of The Spectator, who counters Farage\u2019s claims of rising crime with data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, showing a four-fifths reduction in crime since 1995. The article concludes that Starmer is struggling to counter the 'assembly line of fear' propagated by Reform UK, while the Conservatives appear to be biding their time, waiting for Labour to falter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 02:07 AM\nSource:[International Policy Digest](https://intpolicydigest.org/the-factory-of-perceptions-starmer-s-woes-and-media-magnification/)\n\n**State of the deputy leadership race as ballots open for Labour members - LabourList**\nThe Labour Party's deputy leadership race between Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell entered its final phase as ballots opened on October 8, 2025, with members voting to succeed Angela Rayner as Keir Starmer\u2019s deputy. While media narratives often frame the contest as a proxy battle between Starmer and the soft left or a referendum on the leadership, both candidates have emphasized their individual candidacies. Lucy Powell, the Manchester Central MP and former cabinet member ousted in a recent reshuffle, is widely seen as the frontrunner. She has secured key endorsements from former leader Neil Kinnock, the Andy Burnham-aligned group Mainstream, and the Corbynite organization Momentum, despite not being aligned with the Labour left. Bridget Phillipson, the Education Secretary and cabinet member, has centered her campaign on unity, stability, and continuity, leveraging her record on popular policies like breakfast clubs. Though she has trailed Powell in polling, her campaign faces the risk of becoming a vehicle for broader party discontent. The result is scheduled to be announced on October 25, 2025, leaving the outcome uncertain despite current polling trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[labourlist.org](https://labourlist.org/2025/10/labourlist-deputy-leadership-race-ballots/)\n\n**Bet the farm on it!

Clarkson, who was born in the constituency, questioned voters' satisfaction with their MP in a social media post, asking, 'Would you like it if someone from your neck of the woods kicked him out?' He has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour government since they took power in July 2024, opposing changes to inheritance tax and the Net Zero agenda led by Miliband. Clarkson previously expressed interest in running in 2015 and has shown support for the Conservatives, praising their 'common sense' at the 2025 Manchester party conference. In a recent Sun column, he attacked both Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for economic incoherence and Starmer for economic incompetence, arguing that national prosperity depends on a booming economy free from excessive rules and taxes.

After attending the Labour Party conference in Liverpool and later participating in fringe events at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Burnham publicly criticized Keir Starmer\u2019s government and advocated for radical changes, including reforms to council tax. Although he claims he is not plotting a return to Parliament, his actions\u2014such as engaging with media, attending high-profile events, and aligning with the newly formed 'Mainstream' faction\u2014have fueled speculation. Burnham is ineligible to run for Labour leader unless he regains a parliamentary seat, as only sitting MPs are eligible. He would need to resign as mayor and trigger a by-election, a move complicated by concerns over Labour\u2019s electoral prospects and resistance from the Labour National Executive Committee (NEC), which is seen as dominated by Starmer allies. However, internal party dynamics may shift: Lucy Powell, a Burnham ally, is the frontrunner to replace Angela Rayner as deputy leader and would gain NEC membership. A potential NEC realignment, driven by dissatisfaction with the current leadership\u2019s direction and fears of electoral losses in May, could open the door for Burnham\u2019s ambitions. Neal Lawson of Compass, a Burnham supporter, has publicly called for Starmer\u2019s removal and declared Burnham 'the best version of himself now' and capable of leading the party and defeating Nigel Farage. Despite his current focus on Greater Manchester\u2014especially after the Heaton Park synagogue attack\u2014rumors about his political future are expected to resurface as Labour faces a challenging election season.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 07:04 AM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/what-next-for-andy-burnham-32637584)\n\n**The Factory of Perceptions: Starmer's Woes and Media Magnification**\nSir Keir Starmer, following Labour's decisive victory in the July 2024 UK general election, has experienced a rapid decline in political standing, according to the article.

The article concludes that Starmer is struggling to counter the 'assembly line of fear' propagated by Reform UK, while the Conservatives appear to be biding their time, waiting for Labour to falter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 02:07 AM\nSource:[International Policy Digest](https://intpolicydigest.org/the-factory-of-perceptions-starmer-s-woes-and-media-magnification/)\n\n**SNP backs Swinney\u2019s \u2018clear\u2019 strategy for new independence referendum**\nSNP members have overwhelmingly endorsed leader John Swinney\u2019s strategy for a new independence referendum, demanding a clear majority win in the 2026 Scottish Parliament election\u2014defined as securing 65 or more seats\u2014as the sole uncontested path to a second referendum. This decision, made during the party\u2019s annual conference in Aberdeen, rejected a rebel amendment proposing a 'de facto' referendum model, where a pro-independence majority in the popular vote would automatically trigger independence negotiations. The amendment, previously advocated by former leader Nicola Sturgeon\u2014who later called it a 'mistake'\u2014was opposed by the leadership and many members, who cited confusion over the SNP\u2019s previous strategy during the 2024 UK general election, when the party lost 38 of its 48 Westminster seats. The shift toward a clear, majority-based platform reflects renewed confidence, as the SNP now leads in the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK. The strategy targets 'soft yes' voters who have drifted from the party. While activists like Graeme McCormick and Tommy Sheppard warned of the SNP\u2019s 'hollowing out' and the need for long-term planning beyond 2026, the leadership maintains that securing a majority under the proportional representation system remains a high hurdle\u2014historically achieved only once, in 2011. Additionally, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has consistently stated he will not grant Holyrood the authority to hold a second independence referendum.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 04:22 PM\nSource:[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/11/snp-backs-swinneys-clear-strategy-for-new-independence-referendum)\n\n**Fifth term for SNP looks likely but John Swinney does not deserve it, says Euan McColm**\nJohn Swinney, First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP, is positioning the party for a fifth consecutive Holyrood election victory, despite widespread criticism of his leadership and lack of a detailed independence plan. As the SNP prepares for its conference in Aberdeen, Swinney promoted a new government-produced document claiming an independent Scotland would flourish, though it is described as lacking substantive detail and offering no clear solutions on key issues like currency, EU membership, or securing a second independence referendum (Indyref2). The article notes that Swinney inherited a weakened SNP after Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s resignation and Humza Yousaf\u2019s turbulent leadership, which led to a dramatic loss of seats in the 2024 UK general election\u2014dropping from 48 to just nine MPs. Despite this, the SNP remains on track for another Holyrood win. The article criticizes Swinney\u2019s rhetoric, including his claim that a strong SNP result would force Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign, calling it inconsistent and politically self-serving, especially since Swinney himself did not resign after the 2024 general election defeat. His stance on gender identity, particularly supporting self-ID for trans people, is highlighted as out of step with public opinion, with 60% of voters backing the Supreme Court\u2019s biological definition of sex. The author argues that Swinney\u2019s leadership lacks vision and accountability, and while the SNP may achieve a fifth term due to political instability in Westminster and the rise of Reform UK, Swinney does not deserve such a victory given his failure to deliver a credible path to independence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 02:44 PM\nSource:[The Scotsman](https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/euan-mccolm-fifth-term-for-snp-looks-likely-but-john-swinney-does-not-deserve-it-5355745)\n\n**State of the deputy leadership race as ballots open for Labour members - LabourList**\nThe Labour Party's deputy leadership race between Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell entered its final phase as ballots opened on October 8, 2025, with members voting to succeed Angela Rayner as Keir Starmer\u2019s deputy. While media narratives often frame the contest as a proxy battle between Starmer and the soft left or a referendum on the leadership, both candidates have emphasized their individual candidacies. Lucy Powell, the Manchester Central MP and former cabinet member ousted in a recent reshuffle, is widely seen as the frontrunner. She has secured key endorsements from former leader Neil Kinnock, the Andy Burnham-aligned group Mainstream, and the Corbynite organization Momentum, despite not being aligned with the Labour left. Bridget Phillipson, the Education Secretary and cabinet member, has centered her campaign on unity, stability, and continuity, leveraging her record on popular policies like breakfast clubs. Though she has trailed Powell in polling, her campaign faces the risk of becoming a vehicle for broader party discontent. The result is scheduled to be announced on October 25, 2025, leaving the outcome uncertain despite current polling trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[labourlist.org](https://labourlist.org/2025/10/labourlist-deputy-leadership-race-ballots/)\n\n**Labour in meltdown as MPs urge Keir Starmer to quit - 'We will lose election'**\nAt the Labour Party's annual conference on October 3, 2025, MPs Richard Burgon and Kim Johnson delivered a critical assessment of Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership. Burgon stated that if upcoming elections\u2014including those for the Welsh Parliament, Scottish Parliament, and local councils\u2014follow the trajectory of current opinion polls, Starmer\u2019s departure would be 'inevitable' and this conference would likely be his last. Johnson asserted that Starmer and his inner circle have undermined the left-wing foundations of the party, damaging its ability to defend progressive policies and alienating working-class voters. She concluded that Labour can only reconnect with the working class under a 'new direction' for the party. Johnson\u2019s remarks, the most direct challenge to Starmer\u2019s authority to date, reflect growing internal dissent, especially given her prior clashes with the leadership over policy and discipline. Conservative Deputy Chairman Matt Vickers seized on the internal divisions, declaring Labour\u2019s 'civil war is out in the open.' The article notes that Labour has claimed to have prioritized working people in its first year in government, though this is not directly supported by the cited content.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 04:19 PM\nSource:[express.co.uk](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2116901/labour-meltdown-mps-call-for-starmer-to-quit)\n\n**Andy Burnham says MPs want him to oust Starmer - four ways he could actually do it**\nAndy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, said Labour MPs are privately urging him to challenge Keir Starmer for the party leadership. He denied plotting to return to Westminster but confirmed his ambition to become prime minister, saying 'I stood twice to be leader of the Labour Party. And I think that tells you, doesn't it?'. The article explains Labour\u2019s leadership rules: a contest is triggered only if the leader resigns or the post is declared vacant; MPs can pass no\u2011confidence motions but they have no constitutional effect. A candidate must secure nominations from at least 10\u202f% of the 399 MPs (i.e., 40 MPs) and then either the backing of 5\u202f% of constituency Labour parties (\u224832 CLPs) or support from at least three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions. The winner is decided by a one\u2011member\u2011one\u2011vote system. Burnham\u2019s main barrier is that he is not an MP; until he wins a seat he cannot stand. The article outlines several routes: winning a by\u2011election after a Labour MP resigns, acting as a kingmaker by endorsing a challenger, or waiting until the next general election to stand as an MP. Each route has procedural hurdles and requires alignment of circumstances. The piece concludes that the cleanest path for Burnham is to become an MP at the next general election, after which he could meet the nomination thresholds and contest the leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/andy-burnham-mps-oust-pm-four-ways-he-could-do-it-3937933)\n\n**Could Keir Starmer really be facing a leadership contest?**\nThe article examines the feasibility of a leadership contest to oust Labour leader Keir Starmer. It explains that, under Labour rules, a challenger must secure nominations from 20\u202f% of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), which equates to about 80 MPs, before the Labour conference on 28\u202fSeptember. The piece notes that Starmer\u2019s 2024 electoral victory gave him a personal mandate, making a challenge unlikely. It outlines procedural details, including that a candidate must be an MP or become one via a by\u2011election, and cites the example of Graham Stringer as a potential stand\u2011down. The article compares past PM changes\u2014John Major in 1990 and Boris Johnson in 2019\u2014to suggest that a leadership change would be divisive and unlikely to bring substantial policy shifts. It concludes that a leadership contest would be politically hazardous and would probably prolong internal party conflict.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 09:42 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/politics-explained/labour-leadership-challenge-keir-starmer-andy-burnham-b2827742.html)\n\n**Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell to seek union backing in Labour deputy race**\nThe Labour Party\u2019s deputy leadership contest has moved into the nomination phase, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell securing the required support from MPs to advance past the first round.

Backbenchers such as Richard Burgon have condemned the timetable as the \u2018mother of all stitch\u2011ups\u2019, arguing it sidesteps serious discussion of Labour\u2019s failures. Potential candidates include Emily Thornberry, Lucy Powell, Louise Haigh and Shabana Mahmood, while Labour peer Baroness Harman has called for a woman from outside London. The article reports that following Rayner\u2019s resignation, David Lammy became deputy prime minister and Steve Reed took the Housing portfolio.

Rayner, long seen as a future leader, stepped down on Friday after an independent ministerial interests adviser found she had breached the code by under\u2011paying stamp duty on her Hove flat.  Her departure removes a key voice from the government\u2019s top tier and forces Labour to contest the vice\u2011leadership, though the winner will not automatically become deputy prime minister \u2013 that role is already held by David Lammy following this week\u2019s reshuffle.  The contest comes at a fragile moment for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had promised a \u2018second phase\u2019 of a government reset only days earlier, but public opinion has turned against him.  A YouGov tracker in August recorded Starmer\u2019s approval at 24% versus 68% disapproval.  Within the party, a Survation poll last month showed 64% of Labour members believe the party is heading \u2018in the wrong direction\u2019, with Starmer\u2019s net favour dropping to \u20139.  Rayner\u2019s exit may embolden the left wing of the party to push for a vice\u2011leader who mirrors the left\u2011leaning balance of Starmer\u2019s leadership.  The National Executive Committee will soon set a timetable for the election.  Under current rules, candidates must first secure nominations from 20% of Labour MPs (80 in total), then obtain support from 5% of electoral parties and three affiliates, at least two of which must be trade unions.  Once nominated, Labour members and affiliates will vote in a preferential ballot.  Potential candidates include Shabana Mahmood, the new Home Secretary and a close ally of Starmer, who is credited with shaping Labour\u2019s electoral strategy; Ed Miliband, former party leader and current energy secretary, who holds a net score of +74 in a recent Labour List poll; Emily Thornberry, chair of the foreign affairs committee, who has a strong veteran profile; and Wes Streeting, health secretary, who has a net rating of +9 and narrowly retained his seat in the July general election.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 10:28 AM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/it/notizie/2025/09/06/la-corsa-alla-viceleadership-laburista-si-apre-dopo-le-dimissioni-di-angela-rayner/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts converge on the view that Keir Starmer is highly likely to win the next UK Labour Party leadership election. The assessments cite several key, overlapping reasons: (1) Starmer's incumbent advantage as the recent general election winner, (2) Labour Party procedural rules that make it difficult to trigger and win a leadership challenge, (3) high nomination thresholds for challengers, and (4) absence of unified or eligible alternative candidates, particularly with Andy Burnham not currently an MP. While there is widespread acknowledgment of growing internal dissent, collapsing polling, and mounting media speculation\u2014mainly due to Labour's recent polling behind Reform UK\u2014these factors create only a moderate increase in the probability of a leadership upset. Most experts emphasize that the base rate of toppling a sitting, victorious party leader in government is very low. Leadership change typically follows major scandal, overwhelming electoral disaster, or an extraordinary internal revolt, none of which has yet crystallized. Some risk is attributed to the possibility of a catastrophic event, a prolonged polling crisis, or factional realignment, but these are viewed as potential, not probable, in the near term. Probability estimates from the experts range from 72% to 93% that Starmer will win the next Labour Party leadership election if and when it occurs, most commonly in the mid-80s. In summary, barring unforeseen crisis or a rapid, coordinated elite revolt, Starmer remains an overwhelming favorite to win the next Labour leadership contest, with only slightly elevated (but still low) risk of defeat compared to historical norms.",
