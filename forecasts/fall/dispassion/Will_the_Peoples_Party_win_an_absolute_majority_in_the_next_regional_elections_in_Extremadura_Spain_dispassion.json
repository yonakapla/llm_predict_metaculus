The undecided voter pool is insufficiently large; even if they broke disproportionately for PP, historical late swings in Spain rarely deliver the scale needed (3-5 seats difference).

All forecasters, regardless of disciplinary approach (polling, fundamentals, time series, political science, sociology), independently arrived at nearly identical probability estimates (3-5%) and provided convergent arguments: polling consistently projects the PP below the 33-seat threshold, the D'Hondt system and right-wing vote fragmentation with Vox make a late surge unlikely, and historical base rates for outright majorities in Extremadura are essentially zero. No participant surfaced new information or theoretical grounds to suggest a higher risk of a 'black swan' late swing. If anything, the group consensus and detailed structural arguments justify a slight downward nudge toward the polling aggregation consensus (3%), but the difference is not meaningful in practical terms and reflects only rounding rather than substantive new evidence. Therefore, I maintain my original estimate, with a possible rounding to 3% for alignment, but the reasoning remains unchanged.",

Mar\u00eda Guardiola, the current president of Extremadura, is expected to receive 38.5% of the vote and win 25\u201329 seats (currently holds 28).

These elections follow Vox's decision to break its governing agreement with the PP one year after the 2023 regional elections, when the PP, led by Mar\u00eda Guardiola, won 28 seats and formed a coalition with Vox to secure Guardiola's election as president of the Junta de Extremadura.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 11:52 AM\nSource:[COPE | Noticias y radio online](https://www.cope.es/emisoras/extremadura/noticias/cis-dispara-vox-extremadura-deja-guardiola-lejos-mayoria-absoluta-20251128_3261613.html)\n\n**CIS Releases Pre-Electoral Survey Ahead of Extremadura Regional Elections**\nThe Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) will release a pre-electoral survey on the upcoming regional elections in Extremadura on Friday, November 28, 2025, at 12:30 p.m. The election is scheduled for December 21, 2025, and marks the first regional vote in Spain in 18 months since the June 2024 European elections. The People's Party (PP) aims to secure an absolute majority\u201433 out of 65 seats\u2014to avoid dependence on Vox. In a previous CIS survey from July 2025, the PP led with 27.2% of the vote, 5.6 points ahead of the PSOE (21.6%), while Vox gained 8.8%. Current projections indicate the PP could receive between 40% and 42% of votes, winning 29 to 32 seats\u2014still short of the 33 needed for an absolute majority. The PSOE is expected to receive between 35% and 40% of votes, securing 24 to 28 seats. Vox is projected to increase from 5 seats in 2023 to between 6 and 9 seats, with support rising from 8.1% to as high as 12%. In the 2023 elections, the PP and PSOE tied at 28 seats each, but the PSOE won the most votes. Vox secured 5 seats, and Unidas por Extremadura won 4. The current regional president, Mar\u00eda Guardiola, called the early elections after the PSOE and Vox blocked the 2026 regional budget. Her candidacy faces the PSOE\u2019s Miguel \u00c1ngel Gallardo, who is under investigation for alleged administrative prevarication and influence peddling related to the hiring of David S\u00e1nchez, brother of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, in Badajoz\u2019s provincial council.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20251128/encuesta-cis-elecciones-extremadura-2025-124209183)\n\n**Who Will Win the Extremadura Elections According to Polls?**\nThe upcoming regional elections in Extremadura, scheduled for December 21, 2025, were called by regional president Mar\u00eda Guardiola after the opposition unanimously rejected the proposed 2026 budget, which she argued was essential for job creation and family protection. She emphasized that democratic tools exist for citizens to decide when political blockages occur, stating, 'I have no fear of listening to the people of Extremadura.' The campaign will begin on December 5, coinciding with Guardiola\u2019s birthday, and run until December 19. According to an Electoman\u00eda survey released on November 17, 2025, the People's Party (PP) leads with 41.2% of the vote (29 seats), followed by the Socialist Party (PSOE) with 35% (24 seats), Vox with 11.8% (8 seats), and Unidas Podemos with 6.5% (4 seats). With a parliamentary majority requiring 33 seats, the PP cannot form a government alone and would need Vox\u2019s support. The left-wing coalition falls short of a majority. In contrast, the CIS barometer from July 2025 shows the PP leading with 27.2%, PSOE with 21.6%, and Vox with 8.8%, but notes that 25.4% of voters remain undecided\u2014a potentially decisive group. Additionally, 41% of respondents expressed a desire for a change in regional leadership, compared to 38.9% who wanted to maintain the current leadership, while 20.1% were unsure.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 10:16 AM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/extremadura/quien-ganara-elecciones-extremadura-segun-encuestas-cis-21-diciembre-maria-guardiola_6661906_0.html)\n\n**Extremadura 2025 Elections: Key Dates, Majority Requirements, and Voter Guide for CERA**\nThe 2025 Extremadura regional elections are scheduled for Sunday, December 21, 2025, following the announcement by Mar\u00eda Guardiola, President of the Junta de Extremadura, on Monday, November 4, 2025, due to the opposition's unanimous rejection of the 2026 budget. The campaign will begin on December 5, coinciding with Guardiola's birthday, and last 14 days until December 19. Voters will elect 65 deputies to the Assembly of Extremadura\u201436 from Badajoz and 29 from C\u00e1ceres\u2014requiring 33 seats for an absolute majority. The current government, led by the PP under Guardiola, was formed after the May 28, 2023 elections, where both the PP and PSOE won 28 seats each, Vox secured 5, and Podemos 4. Despite Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Vara receiving the most votes, Guardiola assumed the presidency through a coalition with Vox, which she initially opposed due to Vox\u2019s stance on gender violence, immigration, and LGBTQ+ rights. The coalition collapsed in July 2024 over the reception of migrant minors, though Ignacio Higuero, Vox\u2019s sole regional minister, remained in government and later resigned after being accused of falsifying his CV. The Censo Electoral de Residentes Ausentes (CERA), which registers Spanish citizens abroad with voting rights, will be accessible for review and corrections from November 3 to November 10, 2025, via embassy/consulate, email, or the INE\u2019s Cl@ve-secured platform.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 12:10 PM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/extremadura/elecciones-extremadura-2025-fechas-clave-mayorias-necesarias-guia-voto-cera_6680811_0.html)\n\n**L\u00f3pez Miras Confirms No Early Elections in Murcia, Applauds Guardiola\u2019s 'Courage' Against PSOE and Vox Blockade**\nFernando L\u00f3pez Miras, President of the Region of Murcia, confirmed that there will be no early regional elections in Murcia, rejecting the possibility despite broader plans by the People's Party (PP) to potentially hold a 'super Sunday' of elections across Andalusia, Castilla y Le\u00f3n, and Extremadura. He emphasized political coherence and predictability, stating that the regional government has approved budgets just over three months ago and will complete the current legislative term. L\u00f3pez Miras praised Mar\u00eda Guardiola, President of Extremadura, for advancing regional elections to December 21, 2025, after PSOE and Vox blocked Extremadura\u2019s autonomous budgets. He described her decision as an act of 'courage' and 'leadership' in response to a political 'pinch' from PSOE and Vox, asserting that 'without budgets, governance is impossible.' He reiterated that the PP in Murcia aims to secure an absolute majority (23 seats) in the next election, currently holding 21 seats in the Regional Assembly. L\u00f3pez Miras also publicly supported Guardiola on social media, calling her 'a synonym of leadership, relentless work, and future for Extremadura.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 01:48 PM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/edicion/20251028/miras-confirma-murcia-no-adelanto-electoral-aplaude-guardiola-valentia-frente-psoe-vox/1003743989405_16.html)\n\n**PP in Extremadura Advances Early Elections Amid Budget Crisis and Political Pressure**\nMar\u00eda Guardiola, President of the Junta de Extremadura and leader of the People's Party (PP), announced early regional elections for December 21, 2025, citing the need for a functioning budget and framing the move as a strategic political advantage. The election, which precedes regional votes in Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Andaluc\u00eda scheduled for March and June 2026, comes amid stalled 2025 regional budgets and is seen by the PP as a response to the political instability of the PSOE-led government. Guardiola\u2019s decision follows the confirmation that PSOE, Vox, and Unidas Podemos would present total amendments to the budget, allowing her to preempt the opposition and avoid a legislative deadlock. The PP national leadership, including Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, praised the move as a moral victory, arguing that governments cannot function without approved budgets and criticizing the national PSOE government for budgetary prorogation. The PSOE, led by Miguel \u00c1ngel Gallardo\u2014who is under judicial investigation related to the brother of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2014has labeled the election a 'recognition of failure' and accused Guardiola of lacking autonomy, calling her a 'deputy of the national PP' in Madrid. PSOE sources claim the timing of Gallardo\u2019s aforamiento (legal immunity) was politically opportunistic. Unidas Podemos, with four deputies, views the election as a political maneuver by Guardiola to weaken the PSOE and strengthen Vox\u2019s influence. Recent polls show Guardiola with a narrow lead over PSOE, but no absolute majority (33 seats) is guaranteed. The PP\u2019s strategy is to pressure the national government by pushing early regional elections in other regions, such as Arag\u00f3n, if budget blockages persist. Gallardo will address the media on October 28, 2025, in M\u00e9rida, to outline the PSOE\u2019s response.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[P\u00fablico.es](https://www.publico.es/politica/pp-arranca-ciclo-electoral-adelanto-extremadura-aprovechando-debilidad-psoe-regional.html)\n\n**Guardiola's High-Stakes Gamble: Why She Called Early Elections in Extremadura**\nMar\u00eda Guardiola, presidenta de Extremadura and leader of the People's Party (PP), has called for early regional elections on December 21, 2025, marking the first early elections in the region's history. She announced the move during a press conference, just as the deadline for approving regional budgets expired, citing the inability to govern without approved budgets as the primary reason. Guardiola, who has been in office since May 28, 2023, previously refused to form a coalition with Vox, but later integrated Vox\u2019s sole representative, Ignacio Higueros, into her government\u2014only for him to resign in summer 2024 after falsifying his academic credentials. The PP now holds 28 seats, tied with the PSOE, while Vox has five and Podemos has four. Guardiola\u2019s goal is to secure an absolute majority (33 seats) to avoid relying on Vox again. The decision also serves a broader national political strategy, putting pressure on Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose national government also operates under prorogued budgets. Guardiola\u2019s previous firm stance against Vox\u2014declaring she would not allow those who deny gender violence or marginalize immigrants into government\u2014contrasts with her later coalition with Vox, which has strained her credibility. Her political gamble is further shaped by the weakened state of her main rival, the PSOE, whose candidate, Miguel \u00c1ngel Gallardo, faces judicial investigation over alleged irregularities in hiring and a potential breach of his parliamentary immunity. Other candidates include \u00c1ngel Pelayo Gordillo (Vox), Irene de Miguel (Unidas Podemos), and others from smaller parties. The election campaign will run from December 5 to December 19, coinciding with Guardiola\u2019s 46th birthday. The outcome will shape not only regional politics but also national political dynamics, especially as upcoming elections in Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Andaluc\u00eda are scheduled for 2026.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 09:19 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/espana/2025-10-27/guardiola-se-la-juega-en-extremadura-y-rompe-el-tablero-electoral-por-que-ahora.html)\n\n**PSOE and Vox Study Legal Reform That Further Opens Path to Early Elections in Extremadura**\nThe President of the Junta de Extremadura, Mar\u00eda Guardiola, convened parliamentary groups on Monday to initiate negotiations on the 2026 regional budgets. She warned that if no agreement is reached\u2014similar to the impasse in the current year\u2019s budget\u2014she intends to call for early elections, citing a regional administrative deadlock. The People's Party (PP) has proposed a reform of the Assembly's Rules to extend the next legislative term to four years, as the current text limits it to the original term. Under the current system, early elections in 2026 would necessitate another vote in 2027, aligning with municipal election cycles. The PP submitted the proposal on Tuesday, requesting it be approved via single reading without amendments, potentially allowing passage this month. However, such a reform requires an absolute majority (33 out of 58 seats), which the PP (28 seats) needs either Vox (5 seats) or the PSOE (28 seats) to achieve\u2014making a single abstention from the PSOE sufficient. Both PSOE and Vox have not ruled out supporting the reform, though the PSOE criticizes it as a 'clear blackmail' that it will not tolerate, accusing the PP of prioritizing early elections over passing essential budgets. Vox states it is still evaluating the proposal carefully. Unidas por Extremadura opposes both the reform and the single-reading procedure, calling it a political maneuver driven by national opposition to Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Parallel to this, budget negotiations for 2026 began on Thursday, now involving the Minister of Presidency, Abel Bautista, and taking place at the Junta\u2019s headquarters in M\u00e9rida, unlike previous talks held at the Ministry of Finance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:50 PM\nSource:[Hoy](https://www.hoy.es/extremadura/psoe-vox-estudiaran-reforma-legal-abre-opcion-20251001204941-nt.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasters, across a diverse set of methodologies\u2014polling aggregation, fundamentals-based modeling, time series analysis, political science theories, social identity perspectives, and regional studies\u2014converge on a very low probability that the People\u2019s Party (PP) will win an absolute majority (33+ seats) in the upcoming Extremadura regional elections on December 21, 2025. Every perspective emphasizes that: 1) All reputable recent polls (CIS, SyM, Electoman\u00eda, etc.) consistently put the PP at 25\u201330 seats, with the upper bound still below the majority threshold; 2) The proportional representation system, presence of third and fourth parties (notably Vox and Unidas por Extremadura), and historic patterns in the region do not favor absolute majorities, particularly for the PP, which has never achieved one; 3) Legal scandals facing the PSOE may marginally boost the PP, but fragmentation and high undecided rates are already incorporated into polls, and late swings of the necessary magnitude (3\u20135 seats over polling consensus) are historically very rare in Spain; 4) The collapse of the previous PP\u2013Vox coalition and ongoing party system divisions make consolidation of a majority for a single party especially unlikely; and 5) All plausible scenarios for a Yes (majority) outcome require both unprecedented polling error and a synchronized collapse in opposition, which experts uniformly judge as extremely improbable. Final probabilities ranged from 3% to 5% (most at 3%). The consensus is clear: the PP is expected to win a clear plurality, but an outright majority is highly unlikely.",
