Oracle's September rally briefly put Ellison on top, but this was quickly reversed; no evidence suggests such a sudden, sustained swing is likely in the next 2.5 months.

Moreover, private asset valuations (e.g., SpaceX) are less subject to public market discipline and could be revised sharply if new information emerges or if there is a methodology change at Bloomberg. Therefore, while the base rate for status quo is high, the real probability of a dethroning event is likely somewhat higher than the 88% cited, due to these latent legal and regulatory risks not fully captured by EMH reasoning."

The emphasis on Musk's unique positioning in high-growth, innovation-driven sectors is relevant\u2014his asset holdings do benefit from strong network effects and disruptive moats, which make sudden reversals less probable without a real, negative catalyst. At the same time, the forecast rightly highlights the September 2025 Ellison episode and the real, not-negligible risk of tail events (e.g., tech rout, regulatory crisis) that could shift the rankings. The nuanced probability\u2014high, but not extreme\u2014reflects a sophisticated appreciation of both the recent volatility and the lack of imminent, credible threats from rivals. This measured approach avoids the overconfidence of some behavioral or pure base-rate arguments and is consistent with both historical transitions and the unique market-narrative dynamics of the tech sector. In sum, this is a robust, defensible forecast."

The RBV approach is particularly relevant here because it recognizes that while market volatility affects all tech billionaires, Musk's specific asset profile (Tesla, SpaceX, xAI) provides a greater margin of safety than most, due to the unique growth potential and scale economies in his portfolio. The forecast astutely weighs the low base rate for sudden reversals, and notes that even in the event of sector-wide shocks, Musk's portfolio is relatively buffered compared to rivals with less diversified or less innovative holdings. This lens also supports the argument that unless a true black swan or firm-specific disaster occurs, the status quo is likely to hold, especially over a short time frame. The RBV analysis thus adds a valuable strategic depth to understanding why the probability for Musk to remain #1 is high but not absolute."

It notes that Musk's lead, while subject to significant day-to-day swings, is currently so large that only a highly unusual, idiosyncratic event could plausibly unseat him in 2.5 months. The analysis properly emphasizes the September 2025 Ellison episode as evidence that reversals are possible but rare, requiring an extraordinary set of circumstances unlikely to recur shortly. Furthermore, it weighs both the potential for market-wide tech corrections and the stabilizing effect of Musk's private holdings, mirroring the Efficient Market Hypothesis view that all public information is already priced in. The argument does not fall into the trap of overconfidence, instead acknowledging that while volatility is real, the base rate for a change at the summit is low given current conditions. This balanced approach\u2014neither too conservative nor too extreme\u2014makes the Bloomberg-based forecast especially compelling and robust."

The forecast\u2019s careful calibration\u2014highlighting that only a combination of rare, correlated shocks could dethrone Musk\u2014aligns with both the RBV emphasis on unique, hard-to-replicate asset bases and the observable base rate of infrequent short-term transitions among top billionaires. The analysis also rightly stresses that Musk\u2019s rivals are themselves exposed to similar sector volatility, meaning that a shock would have to be unusually asymmetric. By balancing status quo bias against non-negligible tail risks, this forecast avoids over- or under-confidence and provides a compelling, realistic estimate of the actual risk landscape for Musk\u2019s fortune."

Musk\u2019s fortune is heavily exposed to Tesla and other high-beta assets, and the Bloomberg index is sensitive to daily market fluctuations. Furthermore, Musk-specific regulatory or legal shocks, or an unexpected surge in a rival's stock, remain plausible tail risks over a 2.5-month window.

The September 2025 Ellison incident, in which the #1 position changed hands due to a single-day equity surge, illustrates that even a large cushion can be rapidly eroded by extraordinary events\u2014particularly given the high-beta nature of both Musk's and his rivals' core holdings. Furthermore, the Bloomberg methodology is highly responsive to daily market swings, so both general tech shocks and idiosyncratic events (regulatory, legal, or operational) can have outsized effects. While the narrative effect is real, it cannot eliminate the underlying risk of abrupt fortune reversals, especially over a 2.5-month time horizon. A more calibrated probability, in the 80\u201388% range, better acknowledges these non-trivial tail risks."

For example, Musk\u2019s companies\u2014Tesla, SpaceX, xAI\u2014are subject to intense narrative cycles, meme-driven retail trading, and large institutional window dressing near year-end, all of which can amplify both upside and downside volatility. While base rates matter, the recent pattern of large, rapid swings (upwards and downwards) in Musk's net worth suggests the possibility of a major move cannot be dismissed as just a black-swan event. Additionally, the Forbes methodology is not the resolution source\u2014Bloomberg\u2019s real-time, highly responsive approach makes even a single-day negative Musk event or positive rival event impactful. Thus, while the overall probability is high, the forecast may slightly overstate the stability of the status quo by not fully accounting for these behavioral amplifiers and the specific mechanics of the Bloomberg Index."

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the top 10 billionaires lost a combined US$ 68.8 billion. Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest individual, led the losses with a US$ 15.8 billion decline in his fortune. Jeff Bezos lost US$ 10.2 billion, Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) lost US$ 9.67 billion, and Jensen Huang (Nvidia) lost US$ 8 billion. The sell-off was driven by Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls on critical U.S.-made software, effective November 1, 2025. U.S. tech stocks\u2014Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)\u2014fell approximately 5%, collectively erasing US$ 770 billion in market value.

Thiel made this statement during a private lecture in San Francisco as part of the 'Antichrist' program, according to TASS. He argued that Musk, who is considered the wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of $485 billion, should not participate in the pledge, which requires donating a significant portion of one's wealth to charity during life or through a will. 'Your money will go to left-leaning non-profit organizations chosen by Gates,' Thiel told Musk directly. Musk joined the Giving Pledge in 2012, which has since attracted over 240 major entrepreneurs and business leaders from 29 countries, including Michael Bloomberg, George Lucas, David Rockefeller, and Mark Zuckerberg. Thiel\u2019s warning comes amid reports of a sharp rise in leadership turnover at Musk\u2019s companies, particularly among key AI and robotics specialists. Additionally, following the deterioration of relations between Donald Trump and Elon Musk last summer, leaders from Meta and OpenAI have reportedly sought ways to reestablish ties with the U.S. president.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:59 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/55438856-soratnik-trampa-til-rekomendoval-masku-ne-zhertvovat-sostoyanie-v-giving-pledge-geytsa/)\n\n**The richest people of September 2025: Elon Musk rockets to $490bn, while Bezos takes a billion-dollar dive**\nIn September 2025, the world's top 10 billionaires collectively gained $201 billion, bringing their combined net worth to $2.3 trillion as of October 1, 2025, driven by record-high US stock markets.

This milestone, confirmed by Forbes\u2019 Real-Time Billionaires tracker, places Musk $150 billion ahead of second-place Larry Ellison, who has a net worth of $340 billion. Musk\u2019s wealth surge is driven by three major ventures: Tesla, which contributed an estimated $9.3 billion in value after a 4% stock increase; SpaceX, valued at $400 billion with Musk owning a 42% stake worth $168 billion; and xAI Holdings, a merged AI venture with X (formerly Twitter), valued at $113 billion and worth $60 billion to Musk due to his 53% ownership. Musk\u2019s rise has been rapid: from $24.6 billion in March 2020, he crossed $100 billion in August 2020, became the world\u2019s richest person in January 2021, and reached $400 billion by December 2024. The first trillionaire in history may be within reach by March 2033, when the initial vesting date of Musk\u2019s $1 trillion Tesla pay package occurs.

His net worth briefly peaked at $500 billion before falling to $470 billion by the end of the day, a $10.5 billion increase in a single day, driven by a 3.3% rise in Tesla shares and a further 0.7% gain in pre-market trading. Musk owns a 12\u201313% stake in Tesla, and future performance-based compensation could significantly increase his holdings, potentially making him a trillionaire if certain milestones are met. His wealth is bolstered by ownership of SpaceX, The Boring Company, and xAI, with some private ventures seeing higher valuations in 2025. Despite Tesla\u2019s challenges in European sales and rising competition from Chinese EV makers, its shares have risen over 70% in the past six months, though they remain slightly below the December 2024 record high.

On a single day, Musk\u2019s fortune grew by $10 billion, making him the leading candidate to become the world\u2019s first trillionaire. While Forbes values Musk at $500 billion, Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $459 billion, reflecting methodological differences: Forbes uses more conservative valuations, while Bloomberg adjusts for daily market volatility. Musk\u2019s wealth is not solely tied to Tesla; significant portions stem from private ventures like SpaceX, valued at over $210 billion, and xAI, his AI startup competing with OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The top global fortunes are increasingly concentrated in technology, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms\u2014sectors that have dominated stock market value creation over the past decade.

His Tesla compensation package, based on market performance targets and valued in tens of billions, has drawn criticism from corporate governance bodies and even Pope Leo XIV, who called it 'a distortion of the value of human labor.' Beyond business, Musk was briefly appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in 2025, though he resigned in May to focus on his companies, underscoring his growing influence in U.S. public policy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 10:04 PM\nSource:[Merca2.0 Magazine](https://www.merca20.com/elon-musk-se-convierte-en-la-primera-persona-con-un-patrimonio-de-500-mil-millones-de-dolares/)\n\n**Elon Musk Becomes First Person to Reach $500 Billion Net Worth, According to Forbes**\nElon Musk became the first person in history to reach a net worth of $500 billion, according to Forbes' real-time Billionaires Monitor, which reported the milestone on October 1, 2025. This equates to approximately \u20ac426 billion. Musk, CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX, achieved this by increasing Tesla's stock price by nearly 4%, as he owns about one-fifth of the company. He also holds approximately 42% of SpaceX and 53% of xAI Holdings, which includes the social media platform 'X'. Forbes estimates Musk\u2019s wealth at $438 billion in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is now the wealthiest person globally, surpassing Oracle founder Larry Ellison ($350+ billion), Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg ($245 billion), Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos ($233 billion), and Larry Page ($200+ billion). If current growth trends continue, Forbes projects Musk could become the first trillionaire by March 2033.

Forbes reported Musk's net worth increased by about $10 billion from Tuesday to Wednesday, citing its 'Real-Time Billionaires' rankings, which use interviews and annual research. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which updates daily using stock prices and financial ratios, placed Musk's net worth at $459 billion. Differences in methodology\u2014such as Forbes applying larger discounts and Bloomberg adjusting for taxes and market swings\u2014explain the discrepancy. Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, was ranked second wealthiest by both publications, with Forbes valuing him at $349.1 billion and Bloomberg at $340 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) was valued at $246.7 billion by Forbes and $258 billion by Bloomberg. Jeff Bezos (Amazon) ranked fourth with $233.6 billion per Forbes and $243 billion per Bloomberg. Musk's wealth is primarily derived from ownership stakes in privately held companies like SpaceX and xAI, as well as early investments in PayPal. He previously led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Trump but returned to full-time business activities in May 2025. Tesla's board approved a performance-based pay package for Musk that could make him the world\u2019s first trillionaire, a move criticized by Pope Leo XIV. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 08:34 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/10/01/business/elon-musk-becomes-first-person-worth-500-billion-forbes/)\n\n**Elon Musk Buys $1 Billion in Tesla Shares, Boosts Ownership to 20% and Signals Confidence in Future**\nElon Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla shares on September 12, 2025, acquiring approximately 2.6 million additional shares and increasing his ownership to about 20%, valued at roughly $250 billion according to the Wall Street Journal. This move reinforces his confidence in Tesla, the company he founded and led for over two decades, and sends a strong signal to investors about the future of electric vehicles and autonomous driving. The purchase coincided with a new executive compensation package approved by Tesla's board on September 5, 2025, which could be worth up to $900 billion if Musk achieves ambitious goals over the next decade, including an eightfold increase in Tesla's market value, deployment of one million autonomous taxis, large-scale production of humanoid robots, and a 24-fold increase in profits, while remaining CEO for at least 10 years. The market reacted positively, with Tesla's stock rising nearly 7% on the news. The purchase is interpreted as both a show of commitment to Tesla's strategic vision and a defensive strategy to strengthen Musk's control amid intensifying competition from companies like BYD, Rivian, Lucid Motors, Ford, and General Motors, as well as regulatory challenges in China and Europe. Musk's broader influence is also underscored by his roles as CEO of SpaceX and owner of X (formerly Twitter), and his $1 billion share buyback helped him reclaim the top spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index after briefly losing it to Larry Ellison.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 07:48 PM\nSource:[diarioelnacionalista.com](https://diarioelnacionalista.com/2025/09/15/elon-musk-compra-acciones-de-tesla-por-1-000-millones-de-dolares/)\n\n**Elon Musk's mentor, Larry dislodges him as world's richest person**\nOn September 4\u202f2025, Oracle\u2019s shares surged more than 40% after better\u2011than\u2011expected earnings, lifting the company\u2019s market value to $958\u202fbillion at $340 per share. Larry Ellison, who owns 41% of Oracle, saw his stake rise to $393\u202fbillion, making him the world\u2019s richest person and surpassing Elon Musk\u2019s $384\u202fbillion net worth (Bloomberg). The surge is attributed to global demand for AI services that rely on Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure. Ellison also holds a significant stake in Tesla and previously served on its board; he is 81\u202fyears old. Despite their close relationship and shared support for Donald Trump, Musk\u2019s wealth remains tied to Tesla\u2019s share price, which has faced declining demand and legal challenges in 2025.

Jeff Bezos is listed as the fourth\u2011richest, while Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Steve Ballmer, Jensen Huang, Bernard Arnault, and Warren Buffett round out the top ten.  Musk\u2019s fortune is tied to Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company, and he is noted for holding 15\u202fmillion Tesla shares.  Ellison\u2019s wealth of $280.1\u202fbillion comes largely from Oracle and his Tesla stake.  Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook empire grew from a campus project to a global social\u2011media platform.  Bezos\u2019s Amazon began as a garage startup in 1994 and now dominates e\u2011commerce.  Page and Brin, co\u2011founders of Google, have fortunes of $167.8\u202fbillion and $156.2\u202fbillion, respectively, and Brin recently invested $250\u202fmillion in LTA Research, an airship project.  Ballmer\u2019s $2\u202fbillion purchase of the Los Angeles Clippers followed his Microsoft tenure.  Huang\u2019s Nvidia, with a market cap exceeding $2\u202ftrillion in 2024, keeps him among the richest.  Arnault\u2019s LVMH empire is valued at $151.1\u202fbillion, and Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway net worth is $145.9\u202fbillion.  The piece emphasizes that most of the 2025 richest people derive their wealth from technology\u2011driven companies, underscoring innovation as the economy\u2019s cornerstone.  The article quotes Musk\u2019s status: 'Elon Musk retains his rightful position as the richest person in the world,' and notes that Forbes\u2019 real\u2011time chart tracks these figures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 11:54 AM\nSource:[TEMPO.CO](https://en.tempo.co/read/2042965/10-richest-people-in-the-world-2025-elon-musk-lost-billions)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that Elon Musk is currently the world's richest person, maintaining a decisive lead\u2014typically over $100 billion\u2014over his nearest rivals such as Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, primarily driven by his holdings in Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. The probability assessments for Musk remaining #1 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as of December 31, 2025, are uniformly high across all forecasts, ranging from 83% to 95%, with most clustering in the mid-to-high 80s.  \n\nThe experts cite Musk's diversified portfolio of high-growth tech assets and the historically low rate of turnover at the top of billionaire rankings within short periods as strong factors favoring his continued status. Most forecasters emphasize that Musk's wealth is volatile, highly leveraged to Tesla's share price and private company valuations, and sensitive to macroeconomic shocks, regulatory changes, and market sentiment. However, they conclude that the scale of Musk's current lead makes it unlikely for a competitor to overtake him within the 2.5-month window remaining to question resolution, unless an extreme and unexpected event occurs (such as a catastrophic drop in Tesla's value, a sharp markdown of private assets, or a historically rare surge for a rival driven by extraordinary company performance).\n\nRecurring themes include the resilience provided by Musk's private company holdings, the potential upside from his recent Tesla share purchases and compensation package, and the high correlation among tech sector fortunes, which generally means a sector-wide correction would affect all top contenders similarly. While the risks\u2014such as tech market volatility, regulatory/legal shocks, or sudden surges in rival fortunes\u2014are acknowledged, the consensus is that only a 'black swan' event or a repeat of the kind of extraordinary, Oracle-specific rally observed earlier in 2025 could displace Musk. Overall, the probability that Musk will still be ranked as the world's richest person at year-end is rated as high but not absolute, heavily favoring a 'Yes' outcome due to both the magnitude of his lead and stability norms for billionaire rankings.",
