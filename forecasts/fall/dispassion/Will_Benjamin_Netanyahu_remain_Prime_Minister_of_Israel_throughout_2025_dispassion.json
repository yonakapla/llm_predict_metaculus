The ICC warrant, while damaging internationally, has no domestic legal effect. Health or personal crisis is always a risk, but with no current indication of such an event, this remains a tail risk. The base rate for an Israeli PM completing a calendar year in office is high unless elections are called or a major scandal breaks in a way that uniquely aligns political incentives for removal, which is not currently evident. The fine print raises the threshold for a 'No' resolution, further favoring the status quo. Considering all these factors, the probability that Netanyahu remains PM through 2025 is high but not certain; the main risk is a sudden coalition collapse or personal crisis, but both appear unlikely to materialize in the remaining 2.5 months.",

Recent precedent (2021) shows that transitions to a new PM after elections can take weeks to months, often not aligning with the election date. Barring a swift election and coalition formation, the default is Netanyahu remaining in office. The historical base rate for mid-term removal of Israeli PMs is very low; even after major scandals or war failures, leaders often linger until elections. Given the slow-moving legal process, coalition self-preservation, and the lack of a clear, immediate procedural threat, the probability should be weighted heavily toward the status quo.

The risk of sudden collapse is real, but not dominant at this specific time horizon."

Their probability (58%) is well-calibrated to the reality that, although the procedural mechanisms for removal are slow and elite defection has not yet materialized, the risk of a sudden coalition realignment or legal shock is non-trivial. They also properly note that legal proceedings are unlikely to conclude by year-end, and that the ICC warrant increases reputational\u2014but not direct procedural\u2014pressure.

Their probability (58%) is lower than most status quo-weighted estimates, appropriately reflecting not just coalition and legal inertia but also the credible risk of snap elections or elite realignment before year-end. Their use of comparative base rates across parliamentary democracies and explicit attention to the unique convergence of public, legal, and coalition stressors is well-justified. Unlike more optimistic forecasts, this forecaster does not overstate the difficulty of elite defection or underestimate the compounding risk of multiple crises, while still recognizing that procedural removal is difficult without a definitive coalition break.

(2) There is no active indication of imminent elite defection or coalition collapse, and the legal proceedings are moving too slowly for a near-term, binding outcome.

In Israeli precedent, post-election coalition negotiations are protracted, and the incumbent typically remains PM\u2014sometimes as caretaker\u2014for weeks or months after the vote. Furthermore, the corruption trial and ICC warrant carry more reputational than immediate procedural risk, as the legal process is unlikely to conclude in this calendar year. The forecaster's emphasis on the fine print and the mechanical details of Israeli government succession is critical for accurate probabilistic assessment in this short time window. Their probability (80%) is justified by the convergence of status quo bias, institutional inertia, and the absence of an imminent, actionable threat to Netanyahu's tenure within the timeframe."

The forecaster also correctly notes that, despite deep public discontent and mounting legitimacy crises, Israeli PMs typically remain until elections or a clear elite split occurs. Their assessment that the real threat comes from a potential coalition realignment\u2014rather than the sheer weight of public anger\u2014is well-grounded in Israeli political history, and their quantified risk (about 25% chance of removal) appropriately reflects the credible, but not dominant, possibility of a black swan event or sudden elite revolt."

The analysis rightly emphasizes that elite defection or coalition collapse is plausible but not yet imminent, and that legal processes are moving too slowly for forced removal before year-end. Their moderate probability reflects awareness that while Israeli PMs are usually insulated from short-term removal, the present circumstances\u2014legal jeopardy, severe public disapproval, and coalition volatility\u2014are historically rare and could catalyze a sudden shift. This approach avoids both underestimating and overestimating the risk, providing a realistic midpoint that incorporates elite bargaining dynamics, procedural inertia, and the potential for last-minute shocks, all of which are central to understanding leadership survival in Israel."

Their emphasis on the buffering role of parliamentary institutions during legitimacy crises is core to my own theoretical approach: mass disapproval and international disrepute rarely translate into rapid leadership turnover without elite defection or a procedural mechanism that can act within weeks. The forecaster also accurately points out that the legal and ICC risks, while significant for Israel\u2019s international standing and long-term legitimacy, do not generate immediate procedural dangers. Their assessment that the current situation is less stable than for a typical PM but still favors the status quo for the rest of 2025 is a strong synthesis of base rate analysis and structural realism."

They emphasize the inertia of Israeli political procedures and the practical improbability of coalition collapse or legal removal within the 2.5 months left in 2025, given the slow pace of Israeli judicial processes and coalition negotiations. While my initial forecast placed substantial weight on the real risks of coalition breakdown or a legal bombshell, the procedural realities and fine print resolution criteria (title loss, >30 day absence) make such an abrupt transition by year-end unlikely, even with severe political headwinds.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n[Benjamin Netanyahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu) is the Prime Minister of Israel as of December 2024, since the end of 2022, having previously held the office from 1996 to 1999 and again from 2009 to 2021. Netanyahu is the longest-tenured prime minister in the country's history, having served for a total of over 17 years.\n\nThroughout 2024, Netanyahu's leadership has faced significant challenges, including [ongoing corruption trials](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g30271wxwo) and international legal actions. In November 2024, the International Criminal Court [issued an arrest warrant](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges) for Netanyahu, alleging war crimes committed during the Israel\u2013Hamas conflict. Despite these legal issues, Netanyahu has maintained his position as Prime Minister. Israeli law [permits a prime minister](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-corruption-trial-divides-israeli-public-2024-12-09/) to remain in office unless convicted and after all appeals are exhausted.\n\nPublic opinion has been divided regarding Netanyahu's tenure. In July 2024, [a poll showed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-finds-72-of-israelis-think-netanyahu-should-quit-over-oct-7-failures/) that 72% of Israelis think Netanyahu should quit over the security failures that led to the Hamas attacks in October 2023.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

He faces three separate charges: accepting over $260,000 in luxury goods\u2014including champagne, cigars, and jewelry\u2014from billionaires in exchange for political favors; and attempting to secure favorable media coverage from two Israeli outlets.

In response, Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza, during which over 67,000 Palestinians have been reported killed, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry, which includes both civilians and combatants, with about half being women and children. The trial is ongoing, with no ruling yet issued.

The session was attended by several members of the ruling Likud party, including ministers and Knesset members, showing public support. During the session, Netanyahu briefly left the courtroom after receiving an envelope from an aide. Outside, his motorcade was met with protests from angry demonstrators, though he remained calm and composed. The resumption of the trial coincided with growing political calls for his pardon, following a public appeal by former U.S. President Donald Trump to Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday. Under Israeli law, the president has the authority to grant pardons or reduce sentences based on recommendations from relevant bodies. Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Education Minister Yoav Kisch, both from Likud, supported the calls, calling the trial 'unfair' and harmful to national interests, with Kisch arguing that 'the country faces existential security threats that warrant dropping the case.' Netanyahu faces three corruption cases known as 'Cases 1000, 2000, and 4000.' Case 1000 involves allegations that Netanyahu and his wife Sara received luxury gifts worth over $260,000 from businessmen in exchange for political favors. Case 2000 concerns alleged collusion with the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth for favorable media coverage. Case 4000, considered the most serious, accuses Netanyahu of granting regulatory benefits to businessman Shaul Elovitch, owner of Bezeq and news site Walla, in exchange for positive media coverage. The trial began in May 2020 and is the first in Israel\u2019s history to involve a sitting prime minister. In addition, Netanyahu is under an ICC arrest warrant for alleged war crimes during Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, which resulted in approximately 68,000 Palestinian deaths since October 2023\u2014mostly women and children. The ICC issued arrest warrants in November 2024 against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for 'committing atrocities against civilians' in Gaza. Netanyahu is Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, with a total of 18 years in office across non-consecutive terms since 1996.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:29 PM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5264981)\n\n**Netanyahu in court for graft trial appearance | Macau Business**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared in a Tel Aviv court on October 15, 2025, for the latest hearing in his ongoing corruption trial, which began in May 2020.

U.S. President Donald Trump is visiting Israel, meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Netanyahu, and hostage families, and delivering a speech at the Israeli Parliament. The recent developments have raised questions about the status of the International Criminal Court\u2019s arrest warrant issued in November 2024 against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity during military operations in Gaza. The ICC\u2019s spokesperson, Fadi Abdallah, confirmed that the arrest warrants remain in effect unless formally withdrawn by the court for legal reasons. The Jerusalem Post reported that legal proceedings against Israel at both the ICC and the International Court of Justice are expected to continue even after the war ends and hostages are released.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 02:26 PM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/world/1826823-%D8%A7%D9%95%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%94%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%94%D9%86%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88)\n\n**Does an arrest warrant fly? Why Netanyahu took the long way to the US | Today News**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed Tel Aviv on 26\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 for the United States, taking an indirect route that avoided French and Spanish airspace and instead followed the Mediterranean coast, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, and briefly overflew Greece and Italy, according to FlightRadar24. The flight path was reportedly chosen to sidestep the airspace of countries that are signatories to the Rome Statute and could enforce an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant issued in November\u202f2024 for Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav\u202fGallant on allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity related to Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office said that some journalists and members of his entourage were excluded for \u2018technical arrangements related to seating and security,\u2019 a move reported by the Jerusalem Post as a way to compensate for the extra fuel needed. Slovenia\u2019s government, after banning two far\u2011right Israeli ministers in July, stated \u2018With this move, the government sends a clear message to Israel that Slovenia expects consistent respect for the decisions of international courts and international humanitarian law.\u2019 The article notes that the United Nations General Assembly in New York is underway, with U.S. special envoy Steve\u202fWitkoff presenting a 21\u2011point Middle East peace plan. It also cites that over the past two years, Israeli military operations have killed at least 65,502 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas\u2011run Gaza health ministry, and that the October\u202f7\u202f2023 attack on Israel killed 1,219 people, mostly civilians, per an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 01:49 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/netanyahu-arrest-warrant-why-israeli-prime-minsiter-took-the-long-way-to-the-us-gaza-palestine-war-genocide-un-assembly-11758846741248.html)\n\n**Netanyahu Appears Again Before Court to Respond to Corruption Charges**\nOn September 10, 2025, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared before the Central Court in Tel Aviv to answer corruption accusations. The session was temporarily halted for 40 minutes after Netanyahu received a \"security\u2011related memorandum\" from his office, according to the Israeli Channel 12, before he resumed the hearing. He faces charges of corruption, bribery and abuse of office in three high\u2011profile cases, known as files \"1000\", \"2000\" and \"4000\". File 1000 alleges that Netanyahu and family members accepted valuable gifts from businessmen in exchange for facilitation; file 2000 accuses him of negotiating with the Hebrew newspaper publisher Aron Mosess for favorable coverage; and file 4000 involves providing facilitation to former owner of the Israeli news site \"Walla\" for positive media treatment. The trial began in 2020, and Netanyahu denies the allegations, claiming they are a \"political campaign to overthrow him\". In addition, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on November 21, 2024, charging Netanyahu with war crimes and crimes against humanity for actions in Gaza. The article reports that since the Israeli offensive began on October 7, 2023, Israel has killed 64,656 Palestinians, injured 163,503, and displaced hundreds of thousands, with 404 Palestinians, including 141 children, reported dead from starvation. These figures underscore the gravity of the accusations and the international legal scrutiny facing Netanyahu.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 01:16 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84/%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF/3683809)\n\n**Netanyahu Again Before Court on Corruption and Bribery Charges**\nThe article reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was again brought before the Tel Aviv Central Court on Wednesday to face corruption and bribery charges. The court session was temporarily suspended for 40 minutes after Netanyahu received a security\u2011related memorandum from his office, after which he returned to testify. This is the second consecutive day that Netanyahu appears before the court following a month\u2011long break due to the summer recess. He faces accusations in three major corruption files: the \"1000 file\" involves gifts received by Netanyahu and family members from businessmen in exchange for facilitation; the \"2000 file\" alleges negotiations with a Hebrew newspaper publisher for favorable coverage; and the \"4000 file\" concerns facilitation for a former owner of an Israeli news site in return for positive media. The trial began in 2020, and Netanyahu denies the allegations, claiming they are a political campaign to oust him.\n\nIn addition, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on 21 November 2024 for Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the Gaza conflict. The article notes that Israel, with U.S. support, has been conducting a genocide in Gaza since 7 October 2023, involving killing, starvation, destruction, and forced displacement, despite international calls and ICC orders to halt. The alleged genocide has resulted in 64,656 deaths, 163,503 injuries, and 404 Palestinians killed, of whom 141 were children.\n\nQuotes from the article include: '\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641 1000', '\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641 2000', and '\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641 4000'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 01:10 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/9/10/%d9%86%d8%aa%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a7%d9%87%d9%88-%d9%8a%d9%85%d8%ab%d9%84-%d8%a3%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%85%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b1%d9%83%d8%b2%d9%8a%d8%a9)\n\n**With eyes on re-election, Netanyahu's fights with world leaders aim to distract from his many political problems**\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest\u2011serving prime minister for 17 years, has used a mix of political manoeuvring and public posturing to keep his far\u2011right coalition intact while preparing for the 2026 elections.  The article notes that he has \"managed to neutralise almost all immediate domestic threats to his power\" (article) and that he has \"clashed with Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, who argued against the plan to expand the war into Gaza City\" (article).  Zamir received clear messages to fold or resign, yet \"chose to stay\" (article).  Netanyahu has faced \"hundreds of thousands of people taking part in marches in support of a hostage deal\" and criticism from former senior politicians and ex\u2011security officials (article).  He has acceded to hard\u2011right ministers Ben\u202fGvir and Smotrich, rejecting ceasefire agreements with Hamas and ordering increased military action to achieve what he has called a \"total victory\" (article).  He has also \"indulged Ben\u202fGvir and Smotrich\u2019s talk of resettling Gaza\" and \"enabled their moves to gradually expand Israeli settlements deeper into the West Bank\" (article).  The article reports that Netanyahu has \"angrily rebuked the wave of Western countries recognising, or preparing to recognise, a Palestinian state\" (article) and that his defiant letters to French President Emmanuel Macron and social media outbursts about Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese are aimed at cultivating his image as \"a strong leader for Israel\" among his base (article).  He has also \"felt confident attacking the ICC for issuing warrants against him\" (article).  Netanyahu\u2019s strategy is framed as a distraction from his ongoing trial on bribery and breach of trust charges and from the question of whether to accept a ceasefire that could risk losing his coalition (article).  The article concludes that he is weighing three options: a ceasefire that could win public approval but risk coalition collapse, a continued military operation that could endanger hostages, or a hybrid approach that escalates while negotiating (article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 04:52 AM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/with-eyes-on-re-election-netanyahus-fights-with-world-leaders-aim-to-distract-from-his-many-political-problems-263523)\n\n**Trump Calls Netanyahu a 'War Hero' Amid ICC Arrest Warrant**\nUS President Donald Trump has referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a 'war hero' after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Trump stated in a radio interview with Mark Levin, 'He's a good man. He's fighting. He's a war hero because we worked together. He's a war hero. I think I am too.' Trump did not clarify whether he was referring to the ICC's arrest warrant or Netanyahu's corruption trial in Israel. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on November 21, 2024, for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu is also facing corruption charges in Israel, which Trump had previously called for to be dropped. The Israeli military has launched attacks on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, resulting in the deaths of at least 62,644 Palestinians and injuring 156,573 others. Israel's Security Cabinet approved a plan to occupy the Gaza Strip on August 8, with Netanyahu stating that they aim to occupy the entire territory. However, reports prior to the cabinet meeting suggested that the occupation would be carried out in stages, starting with the city of Gaza and then expanding to the refugee camps in the middle of the territory.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 05:42 AM\nSource:[H\u00fcrriyet](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/trumptan-savas-suclarindan-hakkinda-tutuklama-karari-cikarilan-netanyahu-icin-kahraman-nitelemesi-42920154)\n\n**Netanyahu Begins Security Consultations Ahead of 'Crucial Decisions' on Gaza**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has begun security consultations in preparation for 'crucial decisions' regarding the ongoing war in Gaza. According to Israeli Channel 12, Netanyahu has started intensive security meetings to make 'crucial decisions' about Gaza, with a limited number of ministers in attendance. The meetings come amid reports of Israel's intention to reoccupy Gaza in its entirety, which it previously occupied for 38 years from 1967 to 2005. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been waging a genocidal war in Gaza, including killing, starving, destroying, and forcibly displacing Palestinians, ignoring international calls and orders from the International Criminal Court to stop. The war has resulted in over 211,000 Palestinian casualties, with most being children and women, and over 9,000 missing, in addition to hundreds of thousands of displaced people and a famine that has killed many, including dozens of children. In a previous statement, Netanyahu was quoted as saying, 'It was a great day.' However, it is unclear what he meant by this statement. The Israeli government has been criticized for its handling of the war, with 52% of Israelis holding the government responsible for not reaching an agreement with Hamas, according to a recent poll. Hamas has repeatedly offered to release Israeli prisoners in exchange for an end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The Israeli opposition and families of prisoners have accused Netanyahu of seeking partial deals that would allow the war to continue, ensuring his stay in power. Netanyahu is facing corruption charges that could lead to his imprisonment, and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel has occupied Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon for decades, refusing to withdraw and establish a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem, on the pre-1967 borders.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 05, 2025 04:31 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84/%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A3-%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%80%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A3%D9%86-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9/3651335)\n\n**Netanyahu's Leadership Under Fire as War in Gaza Continues**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been facing a significant challenge to his leadership after his decision to resume military operations in Gaza, which has led to a decline in his popularity. Despite his recent military success against Iran, Netanyahu's approval ratings have not recovered, and he is now considering calling for early elections to secure another term as Prime Minister. However, this move could be a risk, as many Israelis are calling for an end to the war in Gaza and the release of the remaining Israeli prisoners. A recent poll showed that 59% of Israelis want to stop the war in Gaza now, and 49% believe that Netanyahu's continued involvement in the war is due to his own political interests. Professor Tamar Hermann, a leading Israeli democracy researcher, says that Netanyahu is a skilled politician, but his lack of trust among the Israeli public is a major issue. A new poll is expected to show that less than 50% of Israelis trust Netanyahu completely or partially. The professor warns that calling for early elections could be a greater risk for Netanyahu than attacking Iran, as the Middle East is unpredictable. Netanyahu is also facing a major challenge in the form of a high-profile corruption trial, which is set to begin next week. The trial is related to allegations of bribery and fraud, and many Israelis are calling for Netanyahu's removal from office. The US President Donald Trump has weighed in on the issue, calling Netanyahu a 'great hero' and 'warrior', and urging the Israeli court to drop the charges against him. However, many Israelis have criticized Trump's intervention as 'unwise and unjust'. The professor Hermann has described Trump's move as 'treating us like banana republics'. The Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has also criticized Trump's intervention, saying that the US President should not interfere in Israel's internal affairs. The international community is also critical of Netanyahu's handling of the war in Gaza, with many accusing him of damaging Israel's international reputation and economic prospects. The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, charging them with war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The Israeli government has rejected these charges, but the ICC is still pursuing the case.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 09:41 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_publicaffairs/details/2025/6/29/2812234/%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%8A%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%B4%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A3%D9%8A-)\n\n**Will the War with Iran Save Netanyahu Politically?**\nIn November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including using hunger as a weapon against civilian populations in Gaza in response to Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. In April, the execution of the warrant was suspended due to Israel's raised concerns about the ICC's jurisdiction in the case, although it was not formally withdrawn. Netanyahu has also been charged in a corruption trial in his home country, making him the first sitting prime minister to be prosecuted in such a case, which began in 2020.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 12:17 PM\nSource:[wiadomosci.wp.pl](https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/czy-wojna-z-iranem-uratuje-politycznie-netanjahu-opinia-7171108616915840a)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasting experts largely agree that Benjamin Netanyahu is likely to remain Prime Minister of Israel through December 31, 2025, with most assigning a high probability (ranging from 58% to 88%), though one expert is more pessimistic (35%). The consensus arises from several repeated themes across disciplines:\n\n1. **Legal and Institutional Inertia**: Israeli law permits Netanyahu to remain in office unless convicted with all appeals exhausted, a process which experts agree will not complete by the end of 2025. Therefore, legal jeopardy is seen as a slow-moving threat, not likely to force imminent removal.\n\n2. **Coalition Stability**: Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners have strong incentives to avoid early elections, as polling suggests many would lose power. Experts emphasize Netanyahu\u2019s historic skill in coalition management and the lack of signs that key partners are poised to defect.\n\n3. **Public Opinion vs. Systemic Factors**: While public dissatisfaction is unprecedented (polls show over 70% want him to quit), experts underscore that, in Israel\u2019s parliamentary system, public opinion alone rarely removes a PM between elections unless it translates into elite defection or coalition collapse, both viewed as unlikely within the short time frame.\n\n4. **International Pressure (e.g., ICC warrant)**: The ICC arrest warrant is considered diplomatically embarrassing but holds no power domestically or to force removal. It does not materially alter the probabilities.\n\n5. **Risk Factors**: The main risks identified are an unforeseen coalition collapse leading to snap elections, a sudden adverse legal development, or a health/personal crisis incapacitating Netanyahu for over 30 days. Experts note these remain possible but not probable within the remaining 2.5 months of 2025.\n\n6. **Base Rates and Historical Precedent**: The base rate for Israeli PMs being removed mid-term outside of elections or incapacitation is very low. Even in cases of significant scandal or crisis (e.g., the Olmert resignation), transitions typically occur slowly and rarely complete within such a short residual window.\n\n7. **Election Timing**: While some analysts note credible speculation about early elections, there is general agreement that, logistically, elections and the subsequent coalition formation process are unlikely to replace Netanyahu before year\u2019s end unless action is both swift and destabilizing.\n\n**Divergence**: The outlier forecast (35%) emphasizes increased structural headwinds and the possibility of unexpected coalition moves or snap elections, using historical volatility and risk indicators. However, even this perspective allows for Netanyahu\u2019s well-documented resilience and systemic inertia.\n\n**Conclusion**: Experts generally forecast that Netanyahu will survive as Prime Minister through 2025, barring an unforeseen political or personal crisis. Their final probabilities cluster mostly in the 68\u201388% range, with the median around 75\u201380%, and only one notably more pessimistic forecast at 35%.",
