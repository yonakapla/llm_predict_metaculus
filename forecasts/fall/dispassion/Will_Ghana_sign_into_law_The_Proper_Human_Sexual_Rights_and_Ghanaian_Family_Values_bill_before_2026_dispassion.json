However, the repeated historical pattern of presidential hesitancy\u2014based on both international pressure and personal calculation\u2014suggests a non-negligible risk of further delay, especially given Mahama's equivocation and the precedent set by Akufo-Addo.

However, the Supreme Court has now cleared the legal path, and there is strong, renewed parliamentary and religious backing. The president's rhetorical support is a positive sign, but his stated preference for a government-sponsored version, rather than the current private member's bill, is a key procedural obstacle. The time left is short, and Ghana's legislative processes can be slow, especially around the end of the year. Nevertheless, regional momentum and domestic pressure are at an all-time high, and Mahama may view signing the bill as a way to assert his administration's alignment with popular sentiment and religious interests. Weighing these factors, I see the probability as above average but not overwhelming. The likeliest outcome is that some form of the bill is signed, but the possibility of further delay or stalling tactics remains significant.",

The President has a clear political incentive to sign, facing strong pressure from Parliament, religious organizations, and the public. While international actors and some domestic civil society groups are opposed, their influence is limited by the current geopolitical climate and Ghana's regional context. The only significant source of uncertainty is the possibility of deliberate executive delay or political maneuvering, but this risk is diminishing as the deadline approaches and pressure mounts. News coverage shows increasing impatience from both Parliament and prominent ministers (Sam George, religious leaders), and there are no credible reports of new legal or procedural obstacles.

Your caution in not pushing the probability too high (60%) is justified by the real risk that procedural or political delay\u2014rather than outright rejection\u2014could push the signature beyond the resolution deadline.

You also draw appropriate attention to the friction points inherent in Ghana's year-end legislative calendar and the capacity for executive stalling, which are well-documented in Ghanaian political history. From a human rights advocacy perspective anchored in the African Charter, these procedural risks are crucial: while the normative and societal drivers are pushing for passage, technicalities and status quo inertia remain powerful.

The pattern of presidential hesitancy, particularly around procedural nuances (government vs. private member's bill), and the presence of plausible deniability for further delay (e.g., referencing ongoing legal or administrative crises), mean that even a high level of societal and institutional pressure does not guarantee imminent executive action.

You appropriately factor in the persistent risk of presidential delay or procedural stalling, which is supported by both the public record and recent news indicating Mahama's stated preference for a government bill and Ghana's abstention at the UN. Your probability (78%) reflects high likelihood but not near-certainty, which is justified given the short time window and the precedence of executive-level inertia in Ghanaian politics. This nuanced balance between strong regional momentum and local executive friction points is a key strength of your analysis from a legislative process theory perspective."

The alignment of problem, policy, and political streams is a necessary but not always sufficient condition for policy change\u2014especially in institutional contexts, like Ghana, where procedural and legalistic inertia at the executive stage can stall even popular, mature bills. Your emphasis on the distinction between a government bill and a private member's bill is crucial; this procedural nuance gives the executive a credible pretext for delay. Furthermore, administrative bandwidth issues, as highlighted by the recent judicial crisis, and the end-of-year legislative calendar, are real friction points that Kingdon would recognize as potential obstacles closing or narrowing the policy window. Thus, your more moderate probability (65%) is justified and serves as an important reminder that even when all streams appear aligned, implementation is not guaranteed without executive action."

The 2021 Afrobarometer data and the continued activism of religious leaders indeed create an environment where deviation from anti-LGBTQ+ norms carries significant political cost. Importantly, you do not overlook the status quo bias and executive hesitation, recognizing that Mahama's preference for a government bill and the historical pattern of presidential delay are nontrivial obstacles. By assigning a probability of 78%, you accurately reflect both the high likelihood due to social momentum and the enduring risk of procedural or executive stalling. This balanced approach is a strength, as it avoids both overconfidence and undue pessimism, and is well-aligned with comparative political realities in West Africa."

From a moral panic perspective, I focused on the intensity and pervasiveness of the panic and the resulting pressure on all political actors. However, your point that the executive\u2014even under strong societal and institutional pressure\u2014may still act in ways that delay or deflect action is valid and well-supported by Ghana's recent political history. The presidency's balancing act between appeasing domestic moral entrepreneurs and managing international aid and reputation is a structural feature that can blunt even the most intense moral panics. Therefore, your suggestion that a wider confidence interval or slightly lower probability may be warranted is both reasonable and methodologically sound. This addition strengthens the forecast by ensuring that the full complexity of stakeholder interests and veto points is accounted for, and I endorse it as an important refinement to moral panic theory's application in this case."

Importantly, you do not discount the potential for last-minute procedural or legal delays, which is a key point echoed in sociological analyses of institutional inertia and status quo bias. By emphasizing shifting global power dynamics and the declining weight of international pressure on domestic policy decisions, your forecast accurately captures the structural forces that make passage more likely in the current moment. Your probability estimate (85%) appropriately balances high regional and domestic momentum with the residual risk of executive or procedural stalling, and your perspective adds valuable depth to the analysis of how postcolonial states negotiate between domestic normativity and external influences."

From a PostColonialStateTheory perspective, this procedural distinction is not a mere technicality but a reflection of the postcolonial state's ambivalence toward external and internal legitimacy. The President can leverage this procedural ambiguity to balance between domestic and international audiences, delaying action without outright rejection. This is particularly salient in Ghana, where state actors often invoke process and constitutionalism as a means to assert sovereignty while maintaining plausible deniability to donors or international organizations. Your emphasis on the calendar year-end slowdowns and the ongoing judicial turmoil further highlights how institutional rhythms and crises can serve as tools of delay. Thus, your slightly lower probability (65%) is justified, as it reflects not just inertia but also the strategic agency of the executive within the postcolonial context. This strengthens the overall field of forecasts by offering a procedural realism that complements macro-level trend analysis."

In Ghana, the intricate interplay between legislative outcomes and executive procedures\u2014especially the difference between private member's and government bills\u2014has repeatedly proven to be a genuine bottleneck, not a mere formality. Your attention to the potential for procedural delay, presidential preference, and the impact of year-end legislative rhythms is well-founded. These factors are often underappreciated in analyses that focus only on social consensus or regional trends. By assigning a 65% probability, you acknowledge both the high likelihood of passage and the substantial risk of continued stalling.

President Mahama's preference for a government-originated bill remains a significant procedural hurdle, and the potential for year-end scheduling delays or additional legal distractions (e.g., post-Chief Justice removal litigation) is nontrivial. While the strong domestic and regional momentum increases the chance of signature, the base rate for actual presidential assent in Ghana under international scrutiny is not as high as the regional base rate.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values bill - or, more simply, the Ghanaian anti-LGBTQ bill - is a piece of Ghanian legislation which aims to introduce restrictions on LGBTQ persons, essentially making it illegal to identify as any sexual orientation other than heterosexual.\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanaian_anti-LGBTQ_bill#Domestic_reactions), it was introduced in June 2021:\n\n> [Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Parliament_of_Ghana \"Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana\")\u00a0[Alban Bagbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alban_Bagbin \"Alban Bagbin\")\u00a0stated that LGBT+ rights \"should not be encouraged or accepted by our society\" and that \"urgent actions are being taken to pass a law to eventually nip the activities of \\[LGBTQ] groups in the bud.\"\n\nFrom then on, the bill successfully went through three 'readings', as well as several committee hearings. However, then President, Nana Akufo-Addo, failed to sign the bill into law, latterly refusing to do so until two Supreme Court cases challenging the legislation were concluded.\n\nUpon passing the Presidency to current President John Mahama, the bill expired, but the expiry was short lived, and those sponsoring the bill revived it with a renewed legal basis in light of both Supreme Court cases being [unanimously dismissed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrw2r8epw8o#:~:text=Ghana's%20Supreme%20Court%20has%20unanimously,forming%20or%20funding%20LGBT%20groups.):\n\n> A bill that would make it illegal to be anything but heterosexual in Ghana has been reintroduced in parliament with stronger backing than it got the last time lawmakers tried to get it passed into law.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> A parliamentary committee is expected to start its public hearings on the bill\u2019s contents after it resumes from recess in May, said George, who\u2019s also minister of communications in Ghana\u2019s new cabinet.\n\n###### Bloomberg: [Ghana Revives Anti-LGBTQ Bill in Second Attempt to Make It Law](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/ghana-revives-anti-lgbtq-bill-in-second-attempt-to-make-it-law)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":37687,\"question_id\":37040}}`",

Bouley emphasized the danger of the Court dismissing medical consensus, stating that such a precedent could allow the 'treatment' to be protected as free speech, despite its proven harm. He linked the closure of the Pride Center of Vermont to the broader rollback of DEI funding under Project 2025 and Donald Trump\u2019s administration, noting that 57% of LGBTQ+ people have made significant life changes since Trump\u2019s election, with 84% of transgender and nonbinary individuals relocating or altering their lives due to fear and hostility. Bouley criticized Trump\u2019s political shift from neutrality to anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, attributing it to pressure from Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation, Stephen Miller, and evangelical leaders. He also discussed the $700,000 settlement won by Terri Lesley, a librarian fired for refusing to remove LGBTQ+ and sexual health books, highlighting the legal victory under employment law but cautioning that broader accountability remains pending. On media, Bouley expressed concern over Bari Weiss\u2019s appointment as CBS News Editor-in-Chief, arguing her anti-'woke' stance and far-right alignment threaten journalistic balance, especially given Paramount\u2019s Trump-aligned ownership. He condemned a UK court ruling affirming that 'sex' under the Equality Act refers to biological sex, calling it legally enabling harassment of transgender people and creating systemic ambiguity. He urged global recognition of gender identity in legal documents. Finally, he criticized Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for proposing to restrict LGBTQ+ education in schools, drawing parallels to authoritarian regimes and warning that such censorship silences LGBTQ+ families and promotes ideological uniformity in education. The conversation underscored a growing climate of fear, self-censorship, and political weaponization of identity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[The Good Men Project](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/gay-week-lgbtq-rights-project-2025-media-power-sjbn/)\n\n**Columnist Sara Weinberger: Trump's war on transgender rights a devastating rollback of protections - Daily Hampshire Gazette**\nColumnist Sara Weinberger condemns Donald Trump's administration for launching a 'war on transgender rights' following his inauguration on January 20, 2025, marking a devastating rollback of protections established under President Joe Biden. On his first day in office, Trump signed executive orders titled 'Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,' which declared that sex is biologically fixed as male or female and cannot be changed. This action terminated all of Biden\u2019s LGBTQI+ protections, including Executive Order 13988, which had prohibited discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. Since then, the administration has advanced policies that erase transgender identities, including banning gender-affirming care for minors, reinstating restrictions on passport sex markers, and eliminating oversight of transgender individuals in ICE detention centers. The last congressional report on transgender detainees was published on January 17, 2025, after which reporting ceased. The Supreme Court has heard multiple cases affecting transgender rights: Chiles vs. Salazar (on conversion therapy), Trump vs. Orr (on passport sex markers), Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. BPJ (on anti-trans sports bans), and United States vs. Skrmetti (which upheld Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors). These actions have led to widespread fear and displacement, with transgender individuals fleeing the U.S. or relocating within the country to safer states. Weinberger calls for advocacy, urging readers to support transgender rights through engagement with legislators, media, and by subscribing to Erin In The Morning, a trans journalist covering LGBTQ+ issues. The article emphasizes that the administration\u2019s policies constitute a systematic erasure of transgender people, described as a 'deadly war' against those deemed 'not fully human.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 03:51 PM\nSource:[The Daily Hampshire Gazette](https://gazettenet.com/2025/10/19/columnist-sara-weinberger-trumps-war-on-transgender-rights-a-devastating-rollback-of-protections/)\n\n**Hong Kong's top court ordered more protections for same-sex couples. Lawmakers said no.**\nHong Kong's Legislative Council rejected a government-sponsored bill in October 2025 that would have granted limited legal recognition to same-sex couples, despite a 2023 ruling by Hong Kong's top court ordering the government to establish an alternative framework for legal recognition\u2014such as civil partnerships\u2014by October 27, 2025. The bill, which aimed to provide rights including hospital visitation, medical record access, and organ donation decisions for same-sex couples, was opposed by 71 out of 86 lawmakers, who cited concerns over 'traditional Chinese values' and a 'lack of social consensus.' The veto marked the first major legislative split with the government since Beijing's 2021 'patriots-only' electoral reform, which eliminated pro-democracy representation. Although the Hong Kong government expressed disappointment, it stated it would respect the legislature\u2019s decision and pursue administrative measures to protect LGBTQ rights, though details remain unclear. This rejection follows a series of progressive court rulings in 2023 and 2024, including the recognition of gender identity changes without surgery, transgender individuals\u2019 right to use public toilets aligned with their affirmed gender, and a lesbian couple\u2019s right to both mothers\u2019 names on their child\u2019s birth certificate. However, LGBTQ activism has declined, with events like Pink Dot moving online without explanation. Jimmy Sham, a leading gay rights activist and former political prisoner, called the veto a 'great pity' but urged authorities to seek consensus. Legal experts, including barrister Azan Marwah, criticized the legislature for abdicating responsibility, arguing that lawmakers should have amended the bill instead of rejecting it outright. Professor John Burns noted the government delayed action until the last moment, proposing a 'minimalist' bill. Experts warn the lack of legal protections could harm Hong Kong\u2019s global competitiveness, particularly among multinational companies that value diversity.

The Justice Pwamang Committee, which reviewed 10,000 pages of evidence from 13 witnesses, found three grounds for removal: alleged financial misappropriation involving payments to her husband and daughter, questionable judicial decisions violating natural justice, and abuse of administrative discretion. Torkornoo was suspended on April 22, 2025, after petitions from businessman Daniel Ofori, the group Shining Stars, and police official Ayamga Yakubu Akolgo. She has since filed multiple legal challenges, including a judicial review to halt the appointment of Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie as her successor and an application to the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice seeking reinstatement and full benefits. Gyampo\u2019s current stance marks a shift from his earlier firm position in May 2025, when he stated, 'If she is wrong, the law must act; if she is not, the law must act. Araba is not above the laws of Ghana.' He now argues that paying her benefits could help end prolonged litigation and close a chapter on what he calls Ghana\u2019s most dramatic judicial crisis in recent memory. The government maintains that Article 146(9) of the 1992 Constitution required the President to act on the committee\u2019s recommendation, and the process was followed constitutionally. Former Special Prosecutor Martin Amidu has dismissed Torkornoo\u2019s legal actions as 'frivolous, vexatious and abusive,' accusing her of using lawfare to prolong controversy and gain benefits. Former Deputy Attorney General Alfred Tuah-Yeboah criticized the removal as setting a dangerous precedent, questioning whether the evidence met the threshold for dismissal. Torkornoo, Ghana\u2019s third female Chief Justice, was nominated by former President Nana Akufo-Addo in April 2023 and served from June 12, 2023, until her removal. The controversy has sparked sharp political divisions, with the opposition New Patriotic Party calling the suspension a political witch hunt. As Baffoe-Bonnie awaits vetting and parliamentary approval, the legal battles continue. Whether President Mahama will act on Gyampo\u2019s appeal remains uncertain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:21 PM\nSource:[News Ghana](https://www.newsghana.com.gh/gyampo-urges-mahama-to-pay-torkornoos-benefits-despite-removal/)\n\n**Russian Priest: EU's LGBTQ+ Support Undermines Christian Values**\nRussian priest Lokyanov criticized the European Commission's new strategy (2026\u20132030) supporting LGBTQ+ rights, stating it undermines traditional Christian values in Europe. In an interview with Novosti agency, he claimed EU officials aim to eliminate Europe\u2019s Christian civilization, replacing it with a 'modern Babylon' that promotes a global system devoid of morality and the natural family. He questioned whether European populations truly desire this shift, asserting that European Christians will defend authentic human life and values. The European Commission's strategy, confirmed by the Orthodox Journalists' Association, mandates EU member states to ensure 'the right to be oneself' for all citizens, including minors, by simplifying legal procedures for gender transition and recognizing adolescents' autonomy in gender identity. It also emphasizes combating discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity as core European values. The strategy includes recommendations for candidate countries to align with EU anti-discrimination laws. This follows the EU\u2019s first LGBTQ+ strategy adopted in 2020. In contrast, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law in late 2022 banning advocacy of non-traditional sexual relations, gender transition, and pedophilia, prohibiting such content on social media, media, cinema, advertising, and its dissemination to minors, including the sale of related merchandise.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 01:20 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1721893-%D9%82%D8%B3-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A9/)\n\n**This Gay Week 6: LGBTQ Rights, Project 2025, and Media Power**\nKarel Bouley, an LGBTQ+ broadcaster, activist, and journalist, discussed pressing issues affecting the LGBTQ+ community in a This Gay Week interview conducted on October 10, 2025.

The law prohibits efforts to change a minor\u2019s sexual orientation, gender expression, or romantic attraction to the same sex. Chiles claims the law prevents her from having open, ethical conversations with minors questioning their sexuality or gender, forcing her to terminate discussions if they touch on such topics. She asserts that her practice is not 'conversion therapy' but voluntary, client-centered counseling. Since filing her challenge, she has received death threats, harassing phone calls, and menacing emails, and is under investigation by the state licensing authority, which could fine her $5,000 and revoke her license. Her website has been flooded with negative reviews accusing her of promoting harmful treatments. Chiles emphasizes that she does not impose her values but argues that the state\u2019s law imposes its own values on clients, violating ethical counseling principles. She cites her background in Biblical studies and clinical psychology from Dallas Baptist University and Denver Seminary. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in her case, Chiles v. Salazar, on October 7, 2025, with a decision expected by June 2026. The case has drawn national attention amid heightened tensions over LGBTQ+ rights and mental health counseling, particularly in a state with a history of both trans rights activism and violent anti-LGBTQ+ incidents, including the 2022 Club Q shooting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 12:19 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15199593/trans-extremists-threats-supreme-court-kaley-chiles.html)\n\n**Newsom Signs Pet Rescue, Transgender Rights Bills Into Law**\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed three bills into law authored by Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur, addressing pet rescue during disasters, transgender identity document access, and sterile syringe availability. AB 478, the FOUND Act, requires cities and counties to establish pet rescue procedures during mandatory evacuations, inspired by the story of Oreo, a Pomeranian rescued five days after the Palisades Fire.

AB 309 maintains pharmacists' discretion to provide sterile syringes to adults without a prescription, continuing a public health strategy since 2004 to combat HIV and viral hepatitis. Research confirms that syringe access reduces disease transmission without increasing drug use and saves over $300,000 per treated infection. The bill, effective January 1, 2026, was sponsored by the California Pharmacists Association, Health Officers Association of California, Drug Policy Alliance, and San Francisco AIDS Foundation.

The bills are designed to counter perceived abuses of power by the ruling party, particularly in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Judiciary. The 'Choo Mi-ae Prevention Act' targets excessive restrictions on speaking rights, including 189 instances of\u5265\u593a \uc758\uc0ac\uc9c4\ud589\ubc1c\uc5b8 (proceedings speech), 26 cases of forced termination of debate, and 56 cases of unaddressed debate requests since Choo Mi-ae became committee chair. The bill includes provisions such as legally guaranteeing the right to recommend floor leaders, limiting the chairperson\u2019s authority to maintain order, requiring attendance for voting, and preventing debate termination when members remain present. It also clarifies that small handheld signs (A3 size or smaller) and notebook-mounted signs are not considered disruptive. The 'Kim Hyun-ji Prevention Act' addresses the obstruction of key witnesses, allowing automatic witness appointment if one-third of the committee members submit written requests, and mandates immediate issuance of summonses by the chairperson, with refusal deemed illegal. National Assembly member Na Kyung-won stated that these measures are essential to restore democratic deliberation and ensure accountability, criticizing the ruling party for unilateral decision-making and procedural manipulation.

The law, presented in the Sejm by leaders of the Left and PSL, aims to regulate issues such as child support, access to medical information, and joint tax filing for cohabiting couples. Staszewski criticized the proposal, calling it 'a law for everyone, or rather, for no one,' arguing that it fails to provide equal rights for same-sex couples, especially those with children. He emphasized that the requirement to formalize such unions before a notary\u2014rather than at a civil registry office\u2014is undignified and discriminatory. He noted that public opinion polls show Poles support formalizing same-sex relationships, but politicians have not yet matured enough to implement such rights. Terlikowski countered that the Sejm's composition reflects public sentiment, with over half of MPs across multiple parties opposing the measure, suggesting that the public may not prioritize the issue.

In contrast, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law in late 2022 banning advocacy of non-traditional sexual relations, gender transition, and pedophilia, prohibiting such content on social media, media, cinema, advertising, and its dissemination to minors, including the sale of related merchandise.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 01:20 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1721893-%D9%82%D8%B3-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A9/)\n\n**Speaker Bagbin pays courtesy call on Asantehene, extends condolences over Asantehemaa's passing - MyJoyOnline**\nOn Wednesday, October 15, 2025, the Speaker of Parliament, Rt. Hon. Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin, paid a courtesy call on His Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the Asantehene, at the Manhyia Palace to extend Parliament's condolences over the passing of the Asantehemaa, Nana Konadu Yiadom III. The Speaker was accompanied by a parliamentary delegation including the Second Deputy Speaker, Hon. Andrew Asiamah Amoako; the Majority Chief Whip, Hon. Rockson-Nelson Etse Dafeamekpor; the Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Patricia Appeagyei; the Clerk to Parliament, Mr. Ebenezer Ahuma Djietror; and senior parliamentary staff. Bagbin expressed deep sorrow, describing the late Asantehemaa as a 'revered matriarch' whose wisdom, grace, and moral authority shaped Asanteman and Ghanaian society, and emphasized that her legacy would endure in the nation\u2019s cultural and historical memory. He reaffirmed Parliament\u2019s commitment to peace, good governance, and legislative reforms. In response, the Asantehene expressed heartfelt gratitude and commended Parliament\u2019s role in strengthening Ghana\u2019s democracy. As a gesture of goodwill, the Asantehene pledged to donate a newly handwoven kente cloth to replace the one gifted over two decades ago, to be displayed in the Debating Chamber, symbolizing the preservation of Ghanaian culture in legislative traditions. Parliament is scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday, October 21, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 12:39 PM\nSource:[MyJoyOnline.com](https://www.myjoyonline.com/speaker-bagbin-pays-courtesy-call-on-asantehene-extends-condolences-over-asantehemaas-passing/)\n\n**Torture, blackmail, extortion: the dangers of queer online dating in Ghana**\nLGBTQ+ individuals in Ghana, particularly gay men, bisexual men, and transgender women, are facing a surge in online-targeted violence, with criminal gangs exploiting social media platforms like Grindr, TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, and WhatsApp to lure victims. These gangs, often consisting of two to 15 people, use fake profiles to establish contact, then lure victims to isolated locations where they are beaten, humiliated, robbed, and blackmailed\u2014often through the recording and distribution of nude videos and forced confessions. A 25-year-old transgender woman, Delali, described being tortured for three hours after meeting someone on Grindr, with attackers threatening to expose her identity. The situation has worsened since Ghana\u2019s parliament passed the Human Sexual Rights and Family Values bill in February 2024, which imposes prison sentences of three to ten years for same-sex relations and promoting homosexuality, despite former President Nana Akufo-Addo rejecting it due to legal concerns. Human rights groups, including Rightify Ghana and Amnesty International, report a sharp rise in attacks: 300 cases were documented in 2024\u2014three times the previous year\u2014and over 120 cases in 2025 alone, with more than 200 additional reports to other local groups. Most cases go unreported due to fear, stigma, and police indifference or complicity. A viral attack on a 14-year-old boy, Kofi, who was forced to dance and sing 'I am gay' in a local language, was shared widely on TikTok, leading to 12,400 pieces of content created between April 24 and May 31, 2025, including the 'Kofi dance challenge' with over 4,000 videos. The audio was used as a template for hate content, and the trend spurred at least three similar attacks. TikTok removed the associated hashtags after being alerted by The Guardian, stating it prohibits hate speech and sharing private sexual details. Meta, Snapchat, and Grindr did not respond to requests for comment. Ebenezer Peegah of Rightify Ghana described the pattern as a 'disturbing trend' with a coordinated 'playbook' involving specific keywords. Activist Wanluv the Kubolor noted that economic desperation fuels the attacks, calling the LGBTQ+ community a 'carte blanche' for criminals seeking low-risk profit. The attacks are systemic, driven by state-sponsored homophobia and the normalization of violence through political rhetoric during the 2024 presidential election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/10/torture-blackmail-extortion-the-dangers-of-queer-online-dating-in-ghana)\n\n**Burkina Faso passes law outlawing homosexual practices**\nThe Burkinabe parliament passed a new family code that criminalises \u2018homosexual practices\u2019, with penalties of up to five years\u2019 imprisonment and a minimum of two years for first\u2011time offenders, plus financial fines.  Repeat offenders who are not citizens will be expelled from the country.  The law takes effect immediately, Justice Minister Edasso Rodrigue Bayala announced on state television, describing homosexuality as \u2018bizarre behaviour\u2019 and framing the legislation as a defence of \u2018marriage and family values\u2019.  The draft also tightens rules on nationality and stateless people.  Burkina Faso, with a population of about 23\u202fmillion, has been ruled by a military junta since 2022.  Rights groups reacted strongly: Amnesty International called the criminalisation an \u2018alarming setback\u2019 and urged junta chief Captain Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 to reverse the decision, while Human Rights Watch noted that same\u2011sex relationships are illegal in roughly 30 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries.  The parliament adopted the draft unanimously, making Burkina Faso the latest West African nation to enact anti\u2011LGBTQ+ legislation.  The human\u2011rights watchdog warned that the law \u2018does nothing but create discrimination and violates the right to equality before the law,\u2019 and urged Traor\u00e9 to \u2018refer the Code back to the Transitional Legislative Assembly for a revision.\u2019  Similar laws have been adopted in Mali, Ghana and Uganda, and homophobic statutes are in force in about one\u2011third of the world\u2019s nations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 02, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/burkina-faso-passes-law-outlawing-homosexual-practices/a-73855503)\n\n**'I cannot understand the decision to abstain' - Sam George reacts to LGBTQ voting rights**\nGhana's Minister of Communication, Digital Technology and Innovation, Sam George, has expressed his disappointment with the country's decision to abstain from a vote on LGBTQ+ rights at the Human Rights Council. In a Facebook post, he stated that he 'cannot in good conscience understand the decision' and reiterated his firm stance on LGBTQ+ issues. Sam George supports the draft resolution L.24, which aims to protect individuals from violence and discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. He called on Parliament to fast-track the approval process of the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, which was previously passed by the 8th Parliament but not assented to. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had earlier clarified that Ghana abstained from the vote on the renewal of the Mandate of the Independent Expert on Protection Against Violence and Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, citing the country's human rights principles. However, Sam George believes that the decision to abstain was inconsistent with Ghana's position and his own conscience. 'My position on the matter of LGBTQ+ remains steadfast. I have read the full statement Ghana made on the floor in relation to our position on draft resolution L.24. I align fully with the letter and spirit of the text. 'I cannot however in good conscience understand the decision to abstain in the subsequent vote. That vote is in conflict with Ghana's espoused position and my conscience. We MUST at all times make our position clear and unambiguous,' he said. 'Like I indicated earlier, together with my Colleagues in Parliament, we have resubmitted the same Bill that was passed last year by Parliament which Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo refused to sign. I urge Parliament to expedite the approval process so we present the Bill to President John Dramani Mahama. The innocence of Ghanaian children and the sanctity of our values cannot be traded for any considerations. Let truth and our conscience and principles be our guiding light,' he added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 10:12 AM\nSource:[GhanaWeb](https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/039-I-cannot-understand-the-decision-to-abstain-039-Sam-George-reacts-to-LGBTQ-voting-rights-1991102)\n\n**Ghana abstains from UN vote on LGBTQ rights**\nGhana abstained from a UN Human Rights Council vote that renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The vote, which took place on July 7, 2025, was renewed despite Ghana's abstention, with 29 members voting in favor and 15 against. Ghana's abstention is linked to the country's efforts to criminalise LGBTQ+ activities, with the Speaker of Parliament hinting at the reintroduction of an anti-LGBTQ+ bill in May 2025. The bill aims to criminalise LGBTQ+ activities, increase the prison sentence for same-sex acts, and impose jail time for promoting or supporting LGBTQ+ activities, as stated by Speaker Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin, 'The Bill aims to criminalise LGBTQ+ activities in Ghana, as well as the promotion, advocacy, or funding of such activities.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 08, 2025 12:48 PM\nSource:[GhanaWeb](https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Ghana-abstains-from-UN-vote-on-LGBTQ-rights-1990832)\n\n**Ghana: SA Queer Couple's Photos Used to Push Anti-LGBTQ+ Bill**\nA South African gay couple, Lue and Rue, have been at the center of a controversy in Ghana after their photoshoot at symbolic landmarks was used to push for the passage of an anti-LGBTQ+ bill. The bill, which seeks to criminalize identifying as LGBTQ+ or as an ally, has sparked outrage among MPs, who have accused the couple of 'desecrating' national monuments and 'defying' Ghanaian values. MP John Ntim Fordjour declared, 'We shall end this absurdity with the bill.' The matter has reached Parliament, where MPs have called for debate on the bill to be brought forward. MP Vincent Ekow Assafuah wrote to President John Mahama, urging him to ensure the bill is urgently passed and signed into law, saying, 'Condemn what has happened. Speak to the nation.

He believes its enactment would have benefited the nation, citing the recent incident involving tourists identified as homosexuals entering the country and allegedly desecrating national monuments. According to Fordjour, he would have been the 'happiest Ghanaian' if Akufo-Addo had signed the bill after its passage by the 8th Parliament, stating, 'If under former president Akufo-Addo, the Human Sexual Rights and Family Values bill was signed, I would have been the happiest person.'

He questioned, 'What happened to the anti-LGBTQ bill that you promised Ghanaians?' The delay has allowed LGBTQ+ activities to be shown publicly, according to the Minority.

According to Vatican News, the proposed law should be 'treated with utmost urgency.' The request, published last week, was signed by Bishop Matthew Kwasi Gyamfi, head of the Bishops' Conference, and Hilliard Dela Dogbe, head of the Christian Council. Currently, in Ghana, men who engage in 'homosexual acts' face three years in prison. A proposed law, which has been debated for years, would increase the penalty to three years' imprisonment for individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, and between five and ten years for those who 'promote' queerness. The statement from the Bishops' Conference and the Christian Council also expresses concern about the influence of foreign 'ideologies' that threaten traditional family values. However, they ignore the fact that the current ban on homosexuality was introduced by British colonial rulers in 1892, and there were no such laws before. The proposed law was already passed in 2023 but never signed by the then-President Nana Akufo-Addo due to international criticism. The Supreme Court approved the law in December 2024, but Akufo-Addo did not sign it before leaving office. The new President John Dramani Mahama has expressed support for the proposal, but wants a government bill, not a private member's bill. 'As a Christian, I represent the principle and values that there are only two sexes, man and woman, and that marriage is between man and woman,' he said. Pope Francis had previously stated that homosexuality is not a crime, but it is unclear how the new Pope Leo XIV will approach this issue. In Ghana, where the population is predominantly Christian, the rejection of LGBTQ+ individuals is almost universal, with 93% of respondents in a 2021 Afrobarometer survey saying they would not accept same-sex couples.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 09:32 AM\nSource:[queer.de](https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=54059)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts across legal, human rights, policy, political science, sociology, and African studies fields broadly anticipate a high likelihood that Ghana will sign 'The Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values' (anti-LGBTQ) bill into law before 2026. Nearly all experts cite overwhelming parliamentary, religious, and public support\u2014Afrobarometer data and elite consensus indicate minimal domestic resistance and substantial political incentives for passage. The majority note regional momentum (recent anti-LGBTQ laws in Burkina Faso, Mali, Uganda) is emboldening Ghana\u2019s leadership, reducing perceived risk from international backlash.\n\nWhile the last procedural and legal barriers (notably, Supreme Court challenges) have been cleared, a recurrent theme is presidential hesitation: President Mahama, like his predecessor, has delayed action, citing preference for a government bill over a private member\u2019s bill and sensitivity to international aid and diplomatic pressure. International condemnation and the threat of lost donor funding are acknowledged as downward pressures, but are universally seen as insufficient to override strong domestic forces, especially in the short window remaining.\n\nExperts identify some risk of further procedural or political delay, executive inaction, or distraction from political crises (such as the judiciary crisis). However, most judge these unlikely to prevail over mounting internal urgency and the alignment of public, parliamentary, and elite interests. Forecast probabilities cluster at 65\u201390%, with a clear consensus that unless new, significant obstacles arise, the bill will likely be enacted before the January 1, 2026 deadline.",
