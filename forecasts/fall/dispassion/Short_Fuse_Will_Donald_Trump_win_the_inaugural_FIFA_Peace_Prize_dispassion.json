The ongoing U.S. Senate investigation, risk of sponsor revolt (which is more acute ahead of a home-soil World Cup), and the symbolic nature of the event at the Kennedy Center collectively increase the chance that FIFA's leadership calculates the reputational cost as too high. The forecast would be stronger if it explicitly addressed the plausible threshold at which controversy shifts from manageable to existential threat for FIFA and incorporated the very real possibility of a late-stage face-saving compromise (such as a multi-winner scenario or pivot to a less controversial football figure), both of which could resolve the situation without awarding Trump.

However, the group also illuminated the non-trivial risk of last-minute reversal due to the unusually intense political scrutiny in the U.S., active Senate probe, and the reputational risks to both FIFA and the Kennedy Center. Notably, several forecasters highlighted that FIFA\u2019s insulation from external pressure is not absolute in this context, given the U.S. political epicenter and possible sponsor or institutional backlash. The best argument for a lower probability (in the 40s) hinges on the base rate and reputational deterrence, but these appear outweighed by the current momentum, lack of brakes within FIFA, and the symbolic value FIFA stands to gain.

No new, decisive evidence of mounting sponsor revolt, federation rebellion, or a major scandal escalation has emerged in the last few days.

The FIFA World Cup draw will take place in Washington, D.C., USA, on Friday, December 5, 2025. The event will be hosted at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a prominent cultural venue designed by architect Edward Durell Stone, located along the Potomac River. The center, which includes the 2,400-seat Concert Hall, the 2,400-seat Opera House, and the 1,100-seat Eisenhower Theater, will be fully taken over by FIFA from November 24 to December 12, 2025. According to the Associated Press, the Kennedy Center will receive $7.4 million (approximately 85.1 million Norwegian kroner) for hosting the draw. Additionally, FIFA will donate $2.4 million to the center and provide separate sponsorship deals worth an extra $5 million, as confirmed by Roma Daravi, the center\u2019s communications director. During the event, FIFA is expected to award a new peace prize, widely speculated to be given to U.S. President Donald Trump. This has sparked criticism, with Rutgers University professor Ross Baker calling it 'a form of bribery and flattery,' and accusing FIFA of creating a 'fake peace prize' to boost Trump\u2019s ego, calling the act 'shameful.' FIFA President Gianni Infantino has maintained a close relationship with Trump, including opening an office in Trump Tower, attending events with Trump such as the Club World Cup final, and meeting with him in the Oval Office, where Trump held the iconic World Cup trophy.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 01:48 PM\nSource:[dagbladet.no](https://www.dagbladet.no/sport/mottar-85-millioner-kroner/83893410)\n\n**After Visiting White House, Ronaldo Gets Suspension Cut By FIFA**\nCristiano Ronaldo received a reduced suspension from FIFA after being given a three-game ban for a violent conduct red card on November 13, 2024, during Portugal\u2019s 2-0 loss to the Republic of Ireland. FIFA reduced the suspension by two matches, citing Article 27 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, which allows for the remaining two games to be suspended under a one-year probation period. If Ronaldo commits another offense of similar nature and gravity during this period, the suspension will be automatically reinstated and must be served immediately at the next official match. Ronaldo had already served one match, Portugal\u2019s final qualifier against Armenia, a 9-1 win. The suspension reduction followed Ronaldo\u2019s visit to the White House on November 19, 2024, where he met with President Donald Trump, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other business leaders. The visit coincided with bin Salman\u2019s first U.S. trip since the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Ronaldo, who earns $200 million annually playing for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Pro League, is also expected to attend the 2026 World Cup draw on December 5, 2025, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., where President Trump is chairman. The event may feature the presentation of the first FIFA Peace Prize, fueling speculation about political symbolism. Despite the timing and high-profile attendees, FIFA has not confirmed any link between the suspension reduction and the White House visit. Ronaldo has scored 954 goals for club and country as of November 25, 2025.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., is at the center of a political and ethical controversy over its zero-dollar rental agreement with FIFA for hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw on November 6, 2025. According to documents obtained by the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, FIFA used the Center\u2019s concert hall and major facilities from November 24 to December 12, 2025, without paying any rental fee. In exchange, FIFA reportedly provided a $7.4 million donation or sponsorship, though the exact structure and rationale for this arrangement remain undisclosed. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the deal, stating that the Center\u2019s decision to forgo millions in revenue and reduce arts programs constitutes serious mismanagement and violates its statutory mission as a national arts institution. Whitehouse demanded full documentation\u2014including the justification for the donation-based model, whether existing performances were canceled or rescheduled, and whether the Center\u2019s board approved the agreement\u2014by December 4, 2025. The Kennedy Center, led by CEO Rick Greene, dismissed the criticism as a 'political attack,' asserting that FIFA covered all costs and that comparing the arrangement solely to rental fees reflects a misunderstanding of the Center\u2019s operational model. However, the Center has not released the specific financial or legal basis for the donation structure. The controversy is further fueled by the Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of the Center\u2019s board earlier in 2025, with former President Donald Trump claiming to have 'taken control' of the institution and actively promoting conservative events. The World Cup draw was reportedly secured through Trump\u2019s recommendation, and there are unconfirmed reports that FIFA plans to award Trump its newly created 'Peace Award' during the event. The close relationship between FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Trump\u2014longstanding personal ties and public collaboration on international events\u2014has intensified scrutiny. FIFA has even established an office in Trump Tower, further signaling a deepening alliance. As reported by The Athletic, the World Cup draw, intended as the official kickoff of the tournament, has become embroiled in U.S. political conflict amid Senate investigation and public debate.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 09:57 PM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://sports.khan.co.kr/article/202511260654003)\n\n**Ronaldo set to avoid ban at World Cup after red-card verdict offers probation**\nCristiano Ronaldo is expected to avoid missing any matches at the 2026 FIFA World Cup despite receiving a red card during a qualifying match against Ireland, where he elbowed defender Dara O'Shea.

However, FIFA announced on November 26 that the incident did not constitute 'serious violence' and that the remaining suspension would be deferred\u2014enforcing it only if Ronaldo commits a similar offense within the next year. This decision allows Ronaldo to participate in the next World Cup's opening match in 2026. The move has drawn criticism, particularly due to Ronaldo's recent visit to the White House in Washington, D.C., where he met with U.S. President Donald Trump, who gifted him a golden key to the residence. The timing of the decision, following a high-profile meeting with Trump and amid the strategic alliance between Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino over the 2026 World Cup hosted in the U.S., has raised suspicions of political influence. Media outlet The Athletic condemned the decision as lacking precedent, logic, and consistency, calling it a 'symbolic' punishment that undermines FIFA's credibility by prioritizing star power and commercial appeal over rule enforcement. The Athletic stated that the decision 'undermines the organization\u2019s integrity' by failing to establish a clear precedent while exempting a global star.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 11:05 AM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202511261954005)\n\n**Ronaldo can play in 2026 World Cup opener as FIFA 'suspend' ban**\nCristiano Ronaldo, the 40-year-old Portuguese football star and men's all-time top international goalscorer with 143 goals, is eligible to play in the opening matches of the 2026 World Cup after FIFA imposed a partially 'suspended' ban. The ban followed a red card Ronaldo received in November during a 2-0 loss to Ireland, marking his first dismissal in 226 international appearances after elbowing Dara O'Shea. FIFA originally suspended him for three matches, but two of those are suspended under a one-year probation period. According to FIFA\u2019s Disciplinary Code, Article 27, if Ronaldo commits another offense of similar severity during this probation, the suspended matches will be enforced immediately. Ronaldo, currently playing for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia, is aiming to compete in his sixth World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The 2026 World Cup draw is scheduled for December 5, 2025, at 5pm UK time at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., where US President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino will co-announce the group stage fixtures. Trump described the tournament as 'the biggest event in sports,' while Infantino compared the 104 matches to '104 Super Bowls.' Ronaldo attended a White House dinner last week, where he met Trump, who said his son Barron is a 'big fan' of the forward.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[The Express Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2579230/ronaldo-can-play-in-2026-world-cup-opener-as-fifa-suspend-ban)\n\n**2026 World Cup Draw to Revolutionize Tournament Bracket | Sports-Games**\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will feature a groundbreaking 48-team format and a new seeded bracket system designed to prevent the top four ranked teams\u2014Spain, Argentina, France, and England\u2014from meeting before the semifinals, provided they finish top in their round-robin groups. This innovative structure aims to reward consistent performance and enhance competitive balance. The draw ceremony will take place on December 5, 2025, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. The tournament will utilize 16 cities and 11 NFL stadiums as venues, with the final scheduled for MetLife Stadium. Italy is noted as a potential dark horse from lower seed pots.

FIFA reduced the suspension by two matches, citing Article 27 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, which allows for the remaining two games to be suspended under a one-year probation period. If Ronaldo commits another offense of similar nature and gravity during this period, the suspension will be automatically reinstated and must be served immediately at the next official match. Ronaldo had already served one match, Portugal\u2019s final qualifier against Armenia, a 9-1 win. The suspension reduction followed Ronaldo\u2019s visit to the White House on November 19, 2024, where he met with President Donald Trump, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other business leaders. The visit coincided with bin Salman\u2019s first U.S. trip since the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Ronaldo, who earns $200 million annually playing for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Pro League, is also expected to attend the 2026 World Cup draw on December 5, 2025, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., where President Trump is chairman. The event may feature the presentation of the first FIFA Peace Prize, fueling speculation about political symbolism. Despite the timing and high-profile attendees, FIFA has not confirmed any link between the suspension reduction and the White House visit. Ronaldo has scored 954 goals for club and country as of November 25, 2025. The article acknowledges that while conspiracy theories abound in international football, no evidence supports manipulation of the World Cup draw.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 11:11 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellewis/2025/11/25/after-visiting-white-house-ronaldo-gets-suspension-cut-by-fifa/)\n\n**FIFA World Cup Draw at Kennedy Center Sparks Senate Probe Over 'Zero-Dollar' Rental and Political Favoritism**\nThe John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., is at the center of a political and ethical controversy over its zero-dollar rental agreement with FIFA for hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw on November 6, 2025. According to documents obtained by the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, FIFA used the Center\u2019s concert hall and major facilities from November 24 to December 12, 2025, without paying any rental fee. In exchange, FIFA reportedly provided a $7.4 million donation or sponsorship, though the exact structure and rationale for this arrangement remain undisclosed. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the deal, stating that the Center\u2019s decision to forgo millions in revenue and reduce arts programs constitutes serious mismanagement and violates its statutory mission as a national arts institution. Whitehouse demanded full documentation\u2014including the justification for the donation-based model, whether existing performances were canceled or rescheduled, and whether the Center\u2019s board approved the agreement\u2014by December 4, 2025. The Kennedy Center, led by CEO Rick Greene, dismissed the criticism as a 'political attack,' asserting that FIFA covered all costs and that comparing the arrangement solely to rental fees reflects a misunderstanding of the Center\u2019s operational model. However, the Center has not released the specific financial or legal basis for the donation structure. The controversy is further fueled by the Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of the Center\u2019s board earlier in 2025, with former President Donald Trump claiming to have 'taken control' of the institution and actively promoting conservative events. The World Cup draw was reportedly secured through Trump\u2019s recommendation, and there are unconfirmed reports that FIFA plans to award Trump its newly created 'Peace Award' during the event. The close relationship between FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Trump\u2014longstanding personal ties and public collaboration on international events\u2014has intensified scrutiny. FIFA has even established an office in Trump Tower, further signaling a deepening alliance. As reported by The Athletic, the World Cup draw, intended as the official kickoff of the tournament, has become embroiled in U.S. political conflict amid Senate investigation and public debate.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 09:57 PM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://sports.khan.co.kr/article/202511260654003)\n\n**Ronaldo gets 'special treatment' as World Cup ban scrapped**\nFIFA has lifted a three-game suspension for Cristiano Ronaldo, 40, following his red card in a World Cup qualifier against Ireland, where he elbowed defender Dara O'Shea. The decision, announced on November 25, 2025, deferred two of the three games to a one-year probation period, meaning Ronaldo will serve only one game of the ban\u2014already completed in Portugal\u2019s 9-1 win over Armenia. The suspension is contingent on Ronaldo not committing another offense of similar nature and gravity during the probation period. This decision comes just days after Ronaldo met U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at a White House dinner. FIFA President Gianni Infantino attended the event and posed for a selfie with Ronaldo. Portugal coach Roberto Martinez defended Ronaldo, calling the red card 'a bit harsh' and emphasizing Ronaldo\u2019s 226 international appearances without a prior sending-off. Critics, including journalist Henry Winter, accused FIFA of 'special treatment,' citing Ronaldo\u2019s commercial value, global social media reach (1 billion followers), and Saudi Arabia\u2019s financial ties to FIFA\u2014Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup and owns the sovereign wealth fund that controls Ronaldo\u2019s club. The disciplinary verdict is subject to appeal to the FIFA Appeal Committee, though no party has been identified as having legal standing to challenge it.

The probation period includes two friendly matches scheduled for March and likely one or two warm-up games in late May or June, ahead of the World Cup, which begins on June 11, 2026, co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has sparked a major controversy and a U.S. Senate investigation into alleged cronyism and mismanagement. The Kennedy Center\u2019s contract with FIFA, obtained by Senate staff, shows FIFA is granted exclusive use of the Concert Hall and other facilities for a $0.00 rental fee. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the arrangement in a letter to Kennedy Center President Ric Grenell, accusing the Center of being 'looted' and deviating from its statutory mission to promote American performing arts. Whitehouse demanded explanations by December 4, including internal cost estimates, scheduling impacts, and board approvals, and questioned whether FIFA\u2019s creation of a 'Peace Prize'\u2014with speculation that it would be awarded to Donald Trump during the event\u2014factored into the decision. Grenell denied the allegations, claiming FIFA paid millions and covered all event costs through donations and sponsorship opportunities, totaling $7.4 million according to a Center spokeswoman. However, no written evidence was provided, and the structure of payments\u2014donations instead of rental fees\u2014raises questions among tax and nonprofit experts, especially given FIFA\u2019s Swiss nonprofit status and its U.S.-registered subsidiary, FWC2026 US, Inc. The event, scheduled for December 5, will occupy multiple venues at the Center, including the Concert Hall, Eisenhower Theatre, and rooftop spaces, displacing scheduled performances. The move follows the Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of the Center\u2019s leadership in February 2024, replacing Biden-appointed officials with Trump allies. Since then, the Center has hosted non-art events such as the Christian Persecution Summit and a vigil for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, while ticket sales have reportedly declined. FIFA\u2019s choice of the Kennedy Center reportedly came at Trump\u2019s suggestion, with Trump stating, 'We will lay out the red carpet.' The event has drawn scrutiny due to its political undertones, the lack of transparency around payments, and concerns over the Center\u2019s mission being compromised. FIFA has not confirmed whether it is sponsoring the Center or if the 'Peace Prize' will be awarded to Trump, though Infantino has publicly praised Trump and maintained a close relationship with him since the 2026 World Cup bid.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 03:25 PM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6835424/2025/11/25/world-cup-draw-kennedy-center-controversy-fifa-washington-dc/)\n\n**FIFA announces new peace prize to be awarded during World Cup draw**\nFIFA has announced the creation of a new annual award, the FIFA Peace Prize, to be first awarded during the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., on December 5, 2025, at the Kennedy Center.

FIFA has not disclosed the selection process, criteria, or who will decide the winner. The prize marks a departure from tradition, as the World Cup draw has historically focused solely on soccer.

The inaugural award will be presented on December 5, 2025, during the World Cup 2026 group stage draw in Washington DC. FIFA President Gianni Infantino emphasized that the prize recognizes those who work to end conflicts and bring people together in peace. The timing and context have sparked speculation that the award may be intended as a symbolic gesture toward former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a global peacemaker and previously sought the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014though he did not receive it. Infantino has publicly praised Trump\u2019s role in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiations, stating that 'without president Trump, there would be no peace' and that Trump 'has broken barriers, built bridges, and brought people together.' The award ceremony coincides with the World Cup 2026 draw, which will determine the group stage matchups for the tournament hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 04:23 PM\nSource:[Brabants Dagblad](https://www.bd.nl/voetbal/cadeautje-voor-donald-trump-fifa-baas-gianni-infantino-verzint-jaarlijkse-vredesprijs~a893f5d5/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters across a range of disciplines broadly agree that the probability of Donald Trump winning the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize is substantially higher than the historical base rate for such honors, but not a certainty. The key factors increasing the likelihood include the extremely close and unusual personal relationship between FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Donald Trump, the prize\u2019s creation and timing (immediately after Trump\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize snub), the choice of event location (Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Center, under Trump\u2019s influence), and the opaque and discretionary selection process. Many experts note that the event seems specifically orchestrated to flatter and reward Trump for his support and influence regarding the 2026 World Cup and FIFA\u2019s relations with the U.S.\n\nHowever, there are significant countervailing factors: the risk of severe international and domestic backlash, including an ongoing U.S. Senate investigation into FIFA\u2019s dealings, reputational risks to FIFA\u2019s legitimacy, and pressure or criticism from member associations, sponsors, and the public. Most experts emphasize that the historical base rate for global sporting bodies awarding their top honors to sitting or controversial political leaders is extremely low, and that awarding Trump could provoke a major legitimacy crisis for FIFA and undermine the utility of the new award.\n\nDespite this, the convergence of personal incentives, the intense and calculated media speculation, and a lack of credible alternative candidates fuels expectations that Trump is the most likely recipient, unless a last-minute reversal is triggered by heightened controversy or backlash. Estimated probabilities across experts range from a low of 28% to a high of 93%, with most clustering between 63% and 82%. The consensus scenario for a 'Yes' is a highly choreographed event justifying Trump\u2019s award as a gesture for 'uniting people through football,' absorbing the anticipated backlash. For 'No,' FIFA bows to pressure and selects a less controversial, more expected figure to protect its global legitimacy. Most forecasters see the risk of a last-minute reversal as non-trivial but outweighed by the momentum toward Trump as the intended recipient.",
