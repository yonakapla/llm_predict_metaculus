The resolution bar is extremely high: not only must the material be proven extraterrestrial with high confidence, but it must also be shown to be technological, and this must be verified by at least three independent labs and published in a peer-reviewed review within the next 2.5 months. While the Galileo Project is rigorous by the standards of this field, current evidence and community sentiment remain far from the required consensus. Peer review and multi-lab agreement introduce further hurdles, particularly given the short timeline. The demarcation problem\u2014distinguishing the genuinely artificial from the merely anomalous\u2014strongly favors caution and skepticism, especially with ambiguous or controversial evidence. Therefore, while not impossible, the probability is very low.",

My own perspective from spectroscopic analysis aligns: the most advanced analytical techniques to date have not produced unambiguous, unprecedented signatures, and the interpretation of trace element or isotopic anomalies almost always admits natural explanations upon further scrutiny. Their addition of the historical inertia and the timeline for scientific consensus and publication strengthens the case for a very low probability, and I find their base-rate reasoning especially compelling for this context."

Structural failure analysis alone, even if it found unprecedented microstructures or strength, could not meet this evidentiary standard without comprehensive isotopic, elemental, and provenance analyses. Furthermore, your focus on the burden of proof and publication timelines is appropriate, but I would stress that forensic materials science protocols require exhaustive contamination control, chain-of-custody documentation, and demonstrable replicability across labs, which are rarely achieved in such a short window and are not fully addressed in your forecast."

You are also correct in highlighting that the time required for multi-lab collaboration, peer review, and wide scientific consensus is far greater than the remaining 2.5 months. The historical pattern is for claims of artificiality to be met with intense skepticism and subjected to extreme scrutiny, making a rapid Yes resolution nearly impossible.

By emphasizing demarcation as an inherent ambiguity, your argument could inadvertently suggest that the tools for resolving this question are less developed than they actually are. In reality, the community has robust protocols, and the fact that none have yielded evidence of alien technology in decades of application further lowers the probability.

By not foregrounding the explicit standards of evidence required (e.g., reproducibility, independence, systematic elimination of error and bias), your analysis risks treating the status quo as a mere social inertia rather than a reflection of Bayesian reasoning under deep uncertainty and low base rates.

While analytical tools are indeed powerful, history shows that interpretation remains susceptible to theoretical bias, shifting paradigms, and the limits of current scientific understanding. Therefore, even the best protocols can only render a judgment relative to the state of knowledge at the time. Explicitly acknowledging this epistemic humility would reinforce the argument for a low probability, as it highlights not only the robustness of current protocols but also the pervasive risk of false positives and the need for repeated, independent corroboration before accepting a technological, non-terrestrial origin."

The original question opened on 2023-07-21 19:16:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17917). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nIn his book [*Extraterrestrial*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/astronomer-avi-loeb-says-aliens-have-visited-and-hes-not-kidding1/), Harvard astrophysicist [Avi Loeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Loeb) suggests that a 2017 interstellar object known as ['Oumuamua](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/oumuamua/in-depth/) is [\"interstellar technology built by aliens\"](https://www.independent.co.uk/space/avi-loeb-harvard-university-ufos-b2039269.html).\n\nInspired by partially by \u2018Oumuamua, Loeb founded [The Galileo Project](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/) in 2021 to \"[systematically search for extraterrestrial intelligence or extraterrestrial technology on and near Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Galileo_Project).\" Galileo planned and [secured funding for](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/message-in-an-interstellar-bottle-c393ea526e9f) an [expedition](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/summary-of-the-successful-interstellar-expedition-61ff4467070d) to recover portions of an object known as [CNEOS 2014-01-08](https://www.space.com/2014-meteor-first-interstellar-visitor-oumuamua), commonly called [Interstellar Meteor 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNEOS_2014-01-08) (IM1), which crashed of the coast of Papua New Guinea on January 8th, 2014. \n\nIM1 became a target of interest for The Gallileo Project when Loeb and a student, [Amir Siraj](https://scholar.harvard.edu/siraj/home), submitted a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07224) arguing\u2014citing a US Department of Defense [memo](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/DoD.pdf)\u2014that the object originated outside the solar system.\n\n> we identify the \u223c0.45m meteor detected at 2014-01-08 17:05:34 UTC as originating from an unbound hyperbolic orbit with 99.999\\% confidence. The U.S. Department of Defense has since verified that \"the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory.\"\n\nIf Loeb and Siraj are correct, then IM1 is the first [interstellar object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_object) scientifically known to impact the earth. Other scientists have [disputed](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/acm2023/pdf/2226.pdf) their conclusions.\n\n\nBased on IM1's observed toughness, Loeb believes that not only may the object be interstellar, but that it could be [alien technology](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230626-the-underwater-search-for-an-alien-object). To [quote Loeb](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/message-in-an-interstellar-bottle-c393ea526e9f):\n\n> There are two general possibilities. Either IM1 is of new natural origin, or it is artificial, produced by an extraterrestrial technological civilization. Regarding the first possibility, X-ray imaging of the Vela supernova remnant [revealed](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Natur.373..590S/abstract) bow shocks from bullets flying out of the explosion site, a discovery [I attempted to explain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9405071.pdf) three decades ago. It is possible that IM1 was a small bullet tougher than conventional iron meteorites, shot out of an exploding star. But it is also possible that it was a spacecraft, a billion-year old equivalent of our [interstellar probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_probe). Just [imagine](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/the-new-horizons-meteor-a62a3bb177b7) a spacecraft like Voyager 1 & 2, Pioneer 10 & 11 or New Horizons, crashing onto a habitable exo-planet and burning up in its atmosphere. The exo-scientists on this exo-planet would regard the resulting exo-meteor as space trash. However, if they are curious enough to examine the composition of its fragments, they would realize that it was artificial in origin.\n\nUsing a [massive magnetic sled](https://www.livescience.com/interstellar-asteroid-fishing-expedition) to scrape the seabed, Loeb's expedition found [50 spherules](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/avi-loeb-interstellar-object-aliens-b2369534.html) which Loeb believes are portions of IM1. Loeb says these spherules are now being [analyzed](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/starting-the-analysis-of-spherules-from-the-interstellar-expedition-2bc608d2d7ce) by \"three laboratories in UC Berkeley, Harvard and the Bruker Corporation in Germany.\" Loeb is providing regular updates on his [blog](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/starting-the-analysis-of-spherules-from-the-interstellar-expedition-2bc608d2d7ce).\n\n> The fundamental question we will address is whether the elements and radioactive isotopes in the spherules have different abundances than solar system materials. If so, we would also check for any anomalies that might indicate a technological origin. For example, the melted material of semiconductors would include rare elements at a much higher abundance than found in nature.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17917,\"question_id\":17917}}`",

Astronomer Avi Leob from Harvard University suggests there is a '30 to 40 percent chance' that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin, raising speculation about artificial intelligence. Ole J. Knudsen, former director of the Steno Museum Planetarium in Aarhus, acknowledges Leob as a respected scientist with credible arguments but emphasizes the extremely low probability of extraterrestrial origin. He notes that 3I/ATLAS is among the first interstellar objects ever observed from outside our solar system, making it highly unlikely that one of them would be artificial. The object exhibited unusual behavior by accelerating as it approached the Sun\u2014unlike natural bodies, which typically slow due to gravitational forces. This phenomenon mirrors that of 'Oumuamua in 2017, which also triggered debate over its origin. 3I/ATLAS is now the third confirmed interstellar object, and Knudsen highlights that recent technological advances in telescopes and monitoring systems over the past five to ten years have made such discoveries possible. He predicts that many more such objects will be detected in the future due to improved technology.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:25 PM\nSource:[nyheder.tv2.dk](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2025-10-14-fartmonster-fra-det-ydre-rum-vaekker-debat-blandt-forskere)\n\n**A 'Trojan Horse' from Outer Space: What We Know About the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS**\nThe interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, currently traversing the Solar System, is the focus of a major scientific debate set to culminate on October 29, 2025, when it will approach the Sun.

This claim is based on the object's unusual shape, high velocity, and the detection of self-generated light\u2014unlike reflected sunlight\u2014suggesting an active energy source. Loeb argues there is no evidence of a bright cometary tail in the expected direction, which contradicts the typical behavior of comets. He identifies two possible explanations: a rare fragment from a nearby supernova rich in radioactive material, or a spacecraft utilizing nuclear energy, with dust emissions possibly originating from surface debris accumulated during interstellar travel. Loeb considers the supernova fragment hypothesis highly unlikely and believes the data better supports the spacecraft interpretation. He has urged NASA to use the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\u2019s HiRISE camera during the first week of October 2025, when 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Mars, and received a favorable response.

Initially detected as a mysterious comet, 3I/ATLAS has become the focus of speculation due to the absence of detailed information and the silence from prominent astronomers. While early observations reported unusual findings\u2014such as atomic nickel, cyanogen, and an atypical activation rate\u2014news about its trajectory and composition has diminished over time. This information vacuum has fueled claims that agencies like NASA or ESA may be concealing data about the object\u2019s true nature. Avi Loeb, known for his controversial theories about the first interstellar object 'Oumuamua, has suggested that 3I/ATLAS might not be a natural comet but rather an artificial or extraterrestrial technological probe, based on alleged anomalies.

Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb estimated a 30-40% chance the object is non-natural, citing complex maneuvers and 'anomalous' orbital characteristics. However, the scientific community maintains there is no evidence to support these claims. AKM Eahsanul Haque, a SETI researcher, published an analysis showing that 3I/ATLAS's trajectory, though rare, falls within the expected range for a natural interstellar object. Its orbit and proximity to the ecliptic plane are not anomalies requiring extraterrestrial explanations. Spectroscopic and behavioral observations confirm the object behaves like a comet: it emits gas and dust, follows known gravitational laws, and exhibits properties consistent with cometary nuclei. NASA's Tom Statler stated clearly: 'It behaves like a comet. The evidence clearly indicates a natural body, not an alien probe.' In conclusion, 3I/ATLAS is a natural object originating from another region of the galaxy\u2014possibly a fragment from an extrasolar sedimentary basin\u2014worthy of scientific study but not evidence of extraterrestrial technology.

He argues that phenomena such as the interstellar object 'Oumuamua'\u2014which passed near Earth in 2017\u2014may not be natural and could be evidence of extraterrestrial technology. Loeb's controversial theory, suggesting 'Oumuamua' might be an alien spacecraft, was met with skepticism by the scientific community, leading to public division between supporters and critics. Despite NASA forming a dedicated UAP study team in 2021, the agency maintains a cautious stance, stating there is 'no clear evidence' of extraterrestrial origins. Loeb has criticized NASA and the scientific establishment, declaring, 'I search for intelligence in space because I often don\u2019t find it on Earth,' positioning himself as a vocal critic of mainstream scientific institutions. His Galileo Project remains active, promoting open-minded exploration of unexplained phenomena as a way to expand human understanding of the universe.

It notes that Loeb has previously claimed that 1I/Oumuamua might be a form of alien technology, such as a solar sail or probe, and that he led an expedition to recover what he said were fragments of an interstellar object from the Pacific Ocean. Loeb acknowledges the need for further evidence, yet his ideas have sparked a wide scientific debate and heightened interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. The piece quotes Loeb as being \"known for his controversial positions regarding interstellar objects\" and highlights the debate his theories have generated.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[scienzenotizie.it](https://www.scienzenotizie.it/2025/08/22/3i-atlas-il-nuovo-cometa-interstellare-e-le-sue-teorie-13116912)\n\n**Astronomer Suggests New Interstellar Object Could be Advanced Aliens Testing Our Intelligence**\nHarvard astronomer Avi Loeb suggests that the newly-discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may be a 'Turing Test' sent by advanced aliens to assess humanity's intelligence. Loeb, who has previously suggested that the interstellar object 'Oumuamua was an alien spacecraft, believes that 3I/ATLAS's unusual properties, such as its lack of a cometary tail and molecular gas, indicate that it is a technological object sent by an extraterrestrial civilization. Loeb proposes sending a Morse code message to 3I/ATLAS to test his theory, saying 'Hello, welcome to our neighborhood. Peace!' 'It is well known to any interstellar traveler that there are plenty of icy rocks in planetary systems,' Loeb wrote. 'For that reason, an alien might assume that any intelligent observer on Earth must be familiar with space rocks as they impact the Earth on a regular basis,' he continued. 'Not so fast.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 17, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/astronomer-suggests-interstellar-object-could-100058402.html)\n\n**Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Receive Serious Scientific Context**\nUnidentified aerial phenomena have received a serious scientific context for the first time in history, according to Ivan Petri\u010devi\u0107. The search for life in space is moving from theory to practice. The second part of the series 'How we are trying to answer the question: 'Are we alone in the universe?' reveals how scientists, private initiatives, and government agencies are investigating what was previously considered science fiction: traces of extraterrestrial technology, oceans beneath the icy crusts of distant moons, and unexplained objects in the sky. The Galileo Project. While government agencies such as NASA and the Pentagon are increasingly opening up space for analysis of unidentified phenomena, one of the most daring and controversial attempts comes from the academic community, but outside institutional funding. Astro physicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University founded the Galileo Project, a privately funded scientific program that deals with the search for traces of extraterrestrial technology near Earth, including the atmosphere, orbit, and ocean floor. The project uses high-resolution optics, spectroscopy, radar, magnetic detectors, and advanced data processing algorithms in real-time. Systems have already been set up at several locations in the US, and the goal is to create a global network for continuous monitoring of anomalous objects that do not belong to known civil, military, or natural classes. One of the most well-known cases being investigated by the Galileo Project is the interstellar object IM1, which entered the Earth's atmosphere in 2014 at hypervelocity speed. Based on data from the US Department of Defense, the object was classified as the first confirmed interstellar meteorite. Loeb organized an expedition to the coast of Papua New Guinea in 2023, where metal microspheres of 0.1 to 1 mm in size were found. Analysis of the composition showed high concentrations of beryllium, lanthanum, and uranium, which was significantly different from the typical composition of known meteorites. Loeb proposed in a scientific paper that such a composition could indicate artificial origin, but this claim was met with harsh criticism in the community, primarily due to the interpretation of data and assumptions about sampling.\nOriginal language: hr\nPublish date: August 17, 2025 03:31 AM\nSource:[qoshe.com](https://qoshe.com/ve-ernji-list/ivan-petri-evi-/neidentificirane-zra-ne-pojave-prvi-put-u-povijesti-dobivaju-ozbiljan-znanstveni-kontekst/184539085)\n\n**The Galileo Project: A Scientific Search for Extraterrestrial Technology**\nAvi Loeb, an astrophysicist from Harvard, believes that the possibility of other technologically advanced civilizations cannot be ignored and that the only way to approach this question is with data, dedicated instruments, and a prejudice-free perspective. He leads the Galileo Project, an initiative that aims to conduct the first systematic, empirical, and transparent search for evidence of extraterrestrial technology beyond and at the limits of our solar system. The project uses artificial intelligence to filter and process large volumes of data to identify patterns that do not correspond to known atmospheric phenomena, satellites, or aircraft. Loeb and his team are studying objects such as 'Oumuamua, a mysterious interstellar object detected in 2017, and the meteorite CNEOS 2014-01-08, which they believe could have a non-terrestrial technological origin. The project is not limited to deep space, but also searches for possible artifacts in Earth's orbit that could be remnants of non-human technology. Loeb emphasizes that the answer may not be in intentional messages, but in physical objects that are already here, but have not been noticed because we have not known or wanted to look. 'Galileo was punished for looking through a telescope and seeing what others did not want to see. We are not trying to disturb, but we want to open the eyes of humanity', Loeb says.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 14, 2025 08:18 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/neo/ciencia-neo/20250814/10974539/solos-aun-como-mirar-asi-proyecto-galileo-ia-harvard-busca-vida-extraterrestre-mas-sistema-solar.html)\n\n**Avi Loeb: The Harvard Professor Searching for Extraterrestrial Technology**\nAvi Loeb, a Harvard professor and astrophysicist, is leading a pioneering research project to detect signs of extraterrestrial technology. He has been searching for anomalies in the universe, including the possibility of hostile alien technology. Loeb's obsession started with 'Oumuamua, the first interstellar object detected in our solar system. He proposed that it could be an alien solar sail, which sparked skepticism from the scientific community. However, he persisted and founded the Galileo Project in 2021 to apply rigorous scientific methods to the search for extraterrestrial technology. Loeb has also investigated the meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08, which could have been the first detected interstellar object of artificial origin. He organized an expedition to search for fragments and found metal spheres that he considers 'worthy of study.' Loeb's latest discovery is the object 3I/ATLAS, which has an unusual trajectory. He and his team have cautiously suggested that it could be an alien spacecraft with a planned trajectory. Loeb said, 'We don't say it's an alien spacecraft, we say we should investigate it as if it could be one. Science advances by asking bold questions.' Despite his unconventional approach, Loeb is a respected scientist who has directed the Department of Astronomy at Harvard and collaborated with NASA, the Breakthrough Foundation, and the World Economic Forum. He said, 'I prefer to risk being wrong than to overlook a historical event.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 10:09 AM\nSource:[lavanguardia.com](https://www.lavanguardia.com/neo/ciencia-neo/20250813/10972041/avi-loeb-catedratico-harvard-cazador-artefactos-prefiero-arriesgarme-equivocado-pasar-alto-evento-historico.html)\n\n**New Threat to Earth: Physicist Warns of Possible Alien Attack**\nPhysicist Professor Avi Loeb from Harvard University has revealed alarming information that Earth is facing a 'new and terrifying threat' from an unidentified object in space. According to Loeb, a strange and unknown object is heading towards our planet at high speed, raising questions about the possibility that it may be a precursor to an attack by extraterrestrial beings or even a reconnaissance probe sent by an unknown intelligence. The mysterious object, known as (3I/ATLAS), is on an unusual trajectory that may bring it close to three different planets, including Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Loeb and his research team have found new evidence suggesting that the object is actually a 'spacecraft'. They believe that it may approach Earth before the end of this year, sparking concerns about what may happen in the near future. Loeb has warned that the implications of this discovery could be catastrophic for humanity. He has suggested that the object may be a probe sent by intelligent extraterrestrial beings, and that the consequences of this could be severe. Loeb has also raised questions about the possibility of 'Oumuamua', an object that passed through our solar system in 2017, which he believes may have been a spacecraft sent by an unknown intelligence. Loeb has called for increased funding to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and to better understand them. He has also suggested that up to 10% of metal fragments extracted from the Pacific Ocean may contain unknown elements not found in our solar system.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 04:17 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6652165)\n\n**Mysterious Object in Our Solar System May Be Alien Spacecraft Planning Secret Attack on Earth**\nA recent paper by Avi Loeb, a renowned astrophysicist from Harvard University, has sparked a wave of questions and concerns after suggesting that a mysterious object hurtling through our solar system may be an alien spacecraft planning a secret attack on Earth within months. The paper proposes that the object, 3I/ATLAS, may be a technological spacecraft that could surprise us with a sudden attack. The researchers point out that the object's orbit makes it easy for a smart spacecraft to approach Earth undetected, and that when it approaches the sun in late November, it will disappear from our view, allowing it to perform a high-speed, secret maneuver to slow down and remain in the solar system in preparation for a surprise attack. The scientists note that 3I/ATLAS has an unusual orbit that brings it very close to planets like Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, which is unlikely to happen by chance, with a probability of less than 0.005%. Avi Loeb, one of the authors of the paper, is a prominent astrophysicist at Harvard University known for his bold research and outspoken views on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. He has previously suggested that the interstellar object 'Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, may be an artificial spacecraft created by an advanced civilization. The paper, co-authored by Adam Hibberd and Adam Krause, states that the research is based on a hypothetical scenario and not necessarily what they believe to be true. The researchers warn: 'The consequences, if the hypothesis is proven true, could be catastrophic for humanity, and may require defensive measures (although these measures may prove to be unnecessary)'. The study continues to say: 'The hypothesis is an interesting thought experiment in itself, and it's fun to follow it, regardless of its potential validity'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 26, 2025 08:02 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/technology/science-technology/space/265278)\n\n**\u2018Possibly hostile\u2019 alien threat detected in unknown interstellar object, a shocking new study claims**\nA new study by a small group of scientists, including Avi Loeb, a prominent Harvard astrophysicist, suggests that the mysterious intergalactic object 3I/ATLAS could be a 'hostile' alien spacecraft or a piece of extraterrestrial spy technology. Loeb, who previously suggested that the 2017 interstellar object 'Oumuamua could be an artificial recon probe, postulated that 3I/ATLAS's trajectory suggests a similarly alien origin. However, other scientists have thrown cold water on the theory, believing it to be an ordinary comet. Loeb warned that if the anomaly is a 'technological artifact,' it could support the dark forest hypothesis, which argues that extraterrestrial entities remain undercover to shield themselves from predators or prey, and that an attack is likely and would 'possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 06:54 PM\nSource:[nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/07/25/science/possibly-hostile-alien-threat-detected-in-unknown-interstellar-object-study/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts across multiple relevant domains\u2014Forensic Materials Analysis, Aerospace Engineering, Astrophysics, Planetary Science, and Philosophy of Science\u2014strongly converge on an extremely low probability that evidence of alien technology will be recovered near the IM1 crash site before 2026 under the specific, stringent resolution criteria provided. Their independent analyses consistently emphasize: (1) the unprecedentedly high evidentiary standard required\u2014peer-reviewed, systematic, multi-laboratory validation with >95% confidence in both non-terrestrial and technological origin; (2) the complete absence of any historical precedent for confirmed alien technology discovery; (3) the lack, as of October 2025, of any peer-reviewed, multi-lab studies meeting these criteria; (4) ongoing skepticism from the broader scientific community toward existing claims, with all previous anomalous findings ultimately attributed to rare but natural processes or unresolved ambiguity; and (5) the very short timeline (~2.5 months) left before the question resolves, making completion of such a paradigm-shifting publication highly unlikely. While several experts acknowledge the high visibility of Avi Loeb and the Galileo Project and note some unusual findings in IM1 spherules, all judge these as falling well short of the requisite proof, especially considering the rigorous peer review and extraordinary claims principle. Their final probabilities for a Yes outcome cluster between 1% and 2%, with all considering the odds vanishingly small given base rates, scientific scrutiny, technical challenges, and procedural time constraints. In summary: the expert consensus is that a No outcome is overwhelmingly likely barring an unprecedented and rapid breakthrough.",
