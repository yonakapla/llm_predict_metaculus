However, the short time horizon (about 40 days) and heightened party discipline post-shocks are significant obstacles. Still, the ongoing leadership crisis within the Conservatives and the Liberals\u2019 clear incentives to push for a majority mean the risk remains elevated compared to historical norms. The outcome is finely balanced, but the combination of party system instability, leadership uncertainty, and the recent break in norms justifies a probability somewhat above the base rate, though not extremely high due to the time constraint.",

The NDP sought funding from new revenue and reallocation of spending, including from national defence, which receives nearly $82 billion over five years. Sources confirmed that the government did not seriously engage in negotiations, with former NDP official Anne McGrath stating the Liberals were 'going through the motions.' The government secured support through abstentions from two New Democrats (Gord Johns and Lori Idlout) and two Conservatives (Matt Jeneroux and Shannon Stubbs), while five NDP MPs voted against the budget. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet criticized the government for failing to build alliances, warning that future parliamentary battles would be difficult and suggesting a general election could occur as early as next spring. Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne defended the budget as addressing key issues like housing, infrastructure, and defence. Liberal House Leader Steven MacKinnon claimed the government remains open to dialogue but is not in a rush to offer concessions. One unnamed Liberal MP said the government focused more on securing floor-crossers\u2014such as Chris d'Entremont\u2019s defection and Matt Jeneroux\u2019s resignation\u2014than on building cross-party support. The outcome hinged on uncertainty about Conservative abstentions, with two top Conservative officials, Andrew Scheer and Scott Reid, only entering the chamber after the result was clear, claiming technical issues with a remote voting app. The government\u2019s survival was thus attributed to strategic abstentions and procedural uncertainty, not broad consensus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 10:45 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/insiders-say-carney-government-rejected-ndp-demands-before-crucial-budget-vote/article_dd83668a-2570-471b-b3f2-4716132bf1e4.html)\n\n**Liberals escape another confidence vote, as opposition complains their methods are 'not sustainable'**\nThe Canadian federal government survived its fourth confidence vote in under two weeks after the House of Commons passed a ways and means motion to introduce the Budget Implementation Act I, a 600-page bill implementing key measures from the November 4 budget. The motion, tied to budgetary matters, automatically triggered a confidence vote; had it failed, it would have forced the government to resign or call a snap election. The motion passed with a 170-168 vote, narrowly avoiding a potential election during the holiday season. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May provided last-minute support after Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged to uphold the Paris Accord, while four MPs abstained\u2014two Conservative MPs (Matt Jeneroux and Shannon Stubbs) and two New Democrats (Lori Idlout and Gord Johns), with Jeneroux having announced his resignation and Stubbs on medical leave following major jaw and chin surgery. Conservative House leader Andrew Scheer and MP Scott Reid attempted to vote 'no' after the result was known, citing a technical issue with the voting application. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet expressed relief at avoiding a holiday election and criticized the Liberals' minority strategy as 'not sustainable,' despite his party\u2019s unanimous opposition to the main budget motion. Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne stated the government engaged constructively with opposition parties, though opposition leaders argued the government failed to negotiate effectively. Government House leader Steven MacKinnon declined to confirm whether the current approach is sustainable, saying the government would continue advancing policies it believes are in Canada\u2019s long-term interest. The vote marks the end of a high-stakes political standoff that kept Canadians on edge.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 09:21 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/liberals-escape-another-confidence-vote-212127565.html)\n\n**Tasha Kheiriddin: Poilievre lets Carney's irresponsible budget slide through**\nIn a pivotal moment for Canadian politics, Prime Minister Mark Carney's budget passed 170-168 after two NDP and two Conservative MPs abstained, despite prior opposition from multiple parties. The Green Party supported the budget after Carney pledged to meet Canada's Paris Agreement climate targets, while the Bloc Quebecois opposed it over insufficient senior care spending, and the NDP criticized public service cuts. Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont crossed the aisle to support the government, and Matt Jeneroux announced his resignation, signaling internal party fractures. The budget\u2019s passage was not driven by ideological conviction but by strategic avoidance of an election, as all major parties\u2014Conservatives, NDP, Bloc, and Greens\u2014saw no political benefit in a vote that would likely replicate the current minority status quo. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s approval ratings, according to Angus Reid, have hit their lowest point since he became leader, particularly among women, urban voters, and even parts of his base. Internal party tensions have grown, with factions emerging over Poilievre\u2019s leadership, though no alternative leader is in sight. Poilievre faces a leadership review vote in January 2026, where he needs at least 80% support\u2014ideally above 90%\u2014to remain strong. Despite the political maneuvering, Poilievre maintained his hardline stance, rejecting calls to moderate his tone, which resonates with core supporters but risks alienating moderates.

Two senior Conservatives, MPs Andrew Scheer and Scott Reid, claimed their electronic voting app failed and requested to vote against the budget minutes before the vote concluded, but only cast their votes after all other members had finished. Video footage showed individuals behind curtains on the Conservative side during the vote count, though Scheer's chief of staff denied it was him or Reid. The budget passed due to two NDP abstentions and two Conservative absences\u2014Scheer and Reid did not vote, while MP Shannon Stubbs was on medical leave and unable to vote remotely due to facial recognition restrictions from a post-surgery apparatus. Despite Poilievre\u2019s strong opposition to the $78-billion deficit budget, he did not mention the two absent Conservatives in his public statement, instead framing the vote as a 'no' from the party. Former PM Brian Mulroney\u2019s chief of staff David McLaughlin suggested the Conservatives may have strategically manufactured the government\u2019s majority. The Liberals celebrated the outcome, with Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne stating Parliament was 'working,' and Carney calling it 'a great day for Canadians.' Conservative sources indicated the party leadership is focused on a January membership review, not an immediate election, especially given polling showing Carney as the preferred prime minister over Poilievre.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 10:54 PM\nSource:[CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservatives-helped-pass-carney-budget-9.6983603)\n\n**Insiders say Carney government rejected NDP demands before crucial budget vote**\nThe minority Liberal government led by Prime Minister Mark Carney narrowly survived a crucial confidence vote on November 18, 2025, without making major concessions, despite rejecting the New Democratic Party's (NDP) request for approximately $10 billion in new funding for affordable housing, pharmacare, and other priorities. The NDP sought funding from new revenue and reallocation of spending, including from national defence, which receives nearly $82 billion over five years. Sources confirmed that the government did not seriously engage in negotiations, with former NDP official Anne McGrath stating the Liberals were 'going through the motions.' The government secured support through abstentions from two New Democrats (Gord Johns and Lori Idlout) and two Conservatives (Matt Jeneroux and Shannon Stubbs), while five NDP MPs voted against the budget. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet criticized the government for failing to build alliances, warning that future parliamentary battles would be difficult and suggesting a general election could occur as early as next spring. Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne defended the budget as addressing key issues like housing, infrastructure, and defence. Liberal House Leader Steven MacKinnon claimed the government remains open to dialogue but is not in a rush to offer concessions. One unnamed Liberal MP said the government focused more on securing floor-crossers\u2014such as Chris d'Entremont\u2019s defection and Matt Jeneroux\u2019s resignation\u2014than on building cross-party support. The outcome hinged on uncertainty about Conservative abstentions, with two top Conservative officials, Andrew Scheer and Scott Reid, only entering the chamber after the result was clear, claiming technical issues with a remote voting app. The government\u2019s survival was thus attributed to strategic abstentions and procedural uncertainty, not broad consensus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 10:45 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/insiders-say-carney-government-rejected-ndp-demands-before-crucial-budget-vote/article_dd83668a-2570-471b-b3f2-4716132bf1e4.html)\n\n**Liberals escape another confidence vote, as opposition complains their methods are 'not sustainable'**\nThe Canadian federal government survived its fourth confidence vote in under two weeks after the House of Commons passed a ways and means motion to introduce the Budget Implementation Act I, a 600-page bill implementing key measures from the November 4 budget. The motion, tied to budgetary matters, automatically triggered a confidence vote; had it failed, it would have forced the government to resign or call a snap election. The motion passed with a 170-168 vote, narrowly avoiding a potential election during the holiday season. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May provided last-minute support after Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged to uphold the Paris Accord, while four MPs abstained\u2014two Conservative MPs (Matt Jeneroux and Shannon Stubbs) and two New Democrats (Lori Idlout and Gord Johns), with Jeneroux having announced his resignation and Stubbs on medical leave following major jaw and chin surgery. Conservative House leader Andrew Scheer and MP Scott Reid attempted to vote 'no' after the result was known, citing a technical issue with the voting application. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet expressed relief at avoiding a holiday election and criticized the Liberals' minority strategy as 'not sustainable,' despite his party\u2019s unanimous opposition to the main budget motion. Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne stated the government engaged constructively with opposition parties, though opposition leaders argued the government failed to negotiate effectively. Government House leader Steven MacKinnon declined to confirm whether the current approach is sustainable, saying the government would continue advancing policies it believes are in Canada\u2019s long-term interest. The vote marks the end of a high-stakes political standoff that kept Canadians on edge.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 09:21 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/liberals-escape-another-confidence-vote-212127565.html)\n\n**Tasha Kheiriddin: Poilievre lets Carney's irresponsible budget slide through**\nIn a pivotal moment for Canadian politics, Prime Minister Mark Carney's budget passed 170-168 after two NDP and two Conservative MPs abstained, despite prior opposition from multiple parties. The Green Party supported the budget after Carney pledged to meet Canada's Paris Agreement climate targets, while the Bloc Quebecois opposed it over insufficient senior care spending, and the NDP criticized public service cuts. Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont crossed the aisle to support the government, and Matt Jeneroux announced his resignation, signaling internal party fractures. The budget\u2019s passage was not driven by ideological conviction but by strategic avoidance of an election, as all major parties\u2014Conservatives, NDP, Bloc, and Greens\u2014saw no political benefit in a vote that would likely replicate the current minority status quo. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s approval ratings, according to Angus Reid, have hit their lowest point since he became leader, particularly among women, urban voters, and even parts of his base. Internal party tensions have grown, with factions emerging over Poilievre\u2019s leadership, though no alternative leader is in sight. Poilievre faces a leadership review vote in January 2026, where he needs at least 80% support\u2014ideally above 90%\u2014to remain strong. Despite the political maneuvering, Poilievre maintained his hardline stance, rejecting calls to moderate his tone, which resonates with core supporters but risks alienating moderates. The outcome reveals a broader pattern: politics over principle, with the real cost borne by taxpayers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/tasha-kheiriddin-poilievre-lets-carneys-175333417.html)\n\n**Supriya Dwivedi: The budget just barely passing shows that Mark Carney is a still a political rookie**\nPrime Minister Mark Carney's first budget passed by a narrow margin of 2 votes\u2014170 in favor, 168 against\u2014ending weeks of speculation about a potential election in Ottawa. The outcome hinged on two abstentions each from the Conservative and NDP parties; had they voted with their party lines, the budget would have failed. Former senior advisor to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Supriya Dwivedi, argues that this narrow passage reflects poorly on Carney, labeling him a 'political rookie' in a minority Parliament. She emphasizes that in such a context, the government must actively seek opposition support, not assume it. The government delayed consulting opposition leaders until October 21, when interim NDP leader Don Davies publicly criticized the lack of engagement. Although Carney later met with all opposition leaders, the delay raises concerns about strategic prioritization. Dwivedi suggests the government may have bet on attracting disaffected Conservative MPs\u2014such as floor crosser Chris D'Entremont\u2014to secure support, but this strategy failed. She warns that Carney cannot rely solely on moderate Conservatives; he must also compromise with progressive allies, including within his own caucus, to advance his agenda. The article notes that while Carney is an accomplished economist, political effectiveness requires the art of compromise, which he has yet to demonstrate. The Bank of Canada\u2019s recent message underscored that fiscal policy, not monetary policy alone, is now essential for economic progress, placing greater responsibility on political leaders like Carney.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 04:52 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/the-budget-just-barely-passing-shows-that-mark-carney-is-a-still-a-political-rookie/article_f8e5d090-539f-4052-9687-c3aa9a5f2793.html)\n\n**Beyond Local: Liberal budget survives in tight House vote before Carney departs for UAE**\nPrime Minister Mark Carney's minority government narrowly survived a crucial confidence vote in the House of Commons on November 18, 2025, passing 170 to 168.

The plan includes investments in ports and trade infrastructure to double Canadian exports to non-US markets within a decade and provides direct support to businesses affected by US tariffs, with the government projecting C$1 trillion in private sector investment over the same period. To balance the budget, Carney has proposed a 10% reduction in the federal workforce, a move criticized by public sector employees who warn it could slow government operations. The budget, first introduced in early November 2025, survived two prior votes. Debate was overshadowed by partisan drama, including the defection of Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont of Nova Scotia, who cited Pierre Poilievre's 'negative' political style and stated the Liberal budget aligns with his constituents' priorities. Another Conservative MP, Matt Jeneroux of Alberta, resigned the same week to focus on family. These departures raised questions about Poilievre\u2019s leadership, but he affirmed his intention to remain as leader, stating his goal is to lead 'the only leader that's fighting for an affordable Canada where our people who work hard can afford a home and food.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 12:34 AM\nSource:[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8531xvy26o)\n\n**Canadian Prime Minister Faces Crucial Budget Vote That Could Trigger New Election**\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney faces a crucial parliamentary vote on his first budget, with a defeat potentially triggering a second federal election in less than a year. Carney's Liberals hold a narrow majority in the 343-seat House of Commons, requiring support or abstention from opposition MPs to pass the budget. Although Carney appears secure, the left-wing New Democrats\u2014having lost nearly three-quarters of their seats in the April election\u2014have signaled they will not overthrow him, due to financial constraints and lack of a permanent leader. A senior Liberal source told the Globe and Mail that the government expected a narrow victory. If the budget fails, Carney could call a new election or negotiate a deal with the New Democrats, potentially securing their support in exchange for increased social spending, similar to the two-and-a-half-year agreement between Justin Trudeau and the New Democrats. Recent polls suggest the Liberals would retain power in a new election. The Conservative Party, the official opposition, is experiencing internal divisions after its April defeat, and leader Pierre Poilievre faces a formal performance review in January. Carney\u2019s budget, an economic plan for the next fiscal year, proposes doubling the fiscal deficit to counter U.S. tariffs and fund defense and housing programs. While it includes a reduction in federal government employees, it contains fewer austerity measures than feared.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 04:56 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/news/economy-news/premie-do-canada-enfrenta-votacao-crucial-sobre-orcamento-que-pode-provocar-eleicao-1748703)\n\n**Two Conservative MPs are gone.

Two days later, Matt Jeneroux, a Conservative MP from Alberta, announced he would leave politics entirely, a move that followed speculation he might defect to the Liberals. D'Entremont's defection gives Prime Minister Mark Carney one additional seat ahead of a looming confidence vote, which could trigger a federal election. These developments have weakened Pierre Poilievre's opposition benches, signaling growing instability within the Conservative Party.

Carney is now two seats short of a majority, and success in securing the budget will determine whether his government survives its first year. The political turmoil has been fueled by a defection: Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont announced he was considering joining the Liberals, later confirming his departure, which triggered panic in the Conservative caucus. Speculation followed that MP Matt Jeneroux might also cross the floor, but he instead announced his resignation from politics on Thursday, citing personal reasons and a desire to focus on his family. Jeneroux\u2019s office confirmed he had been in discussions with the Liberals and even spoke with Carney, though the Prime Minister\u2019s Office declined to comment. The Liberals claim Jeneroux was pressured by conservative bullying and threats, including death threats reported to the RCMP, while Conservative leaders like Andrew Scheer accused Carney of undemocratic backroom deals. Despite the chaos, the Conservatives rallied behind Leader Pierre Poilievre, who avoided media all week but later projected confidence in Toronto, vowing to broaden their base. Liberal MPs, including Judy Sgro and Mark Gerretsen, argue that Poilievre\u2019s populist leadership is driving progressive Conservatives away and that the party is fracturing. The outcome of the budget vote remains uncertain, with Carney needing two additional votes to pass the legislation; failure would trigger a snap election.

Their actions occurred amid growing internal dissent following Pierre Poilievre\u2019s controversial interview, in which he labeled the RCMP leadership 'despicable' and alleged unproven misconduct by Justin Trudeau. Poilievre had previously claimed unity within the party, but the defections exposed cracks in that narrative. d'Entremont cited a misalignment with the party\u2019s ideals and a desire to 'lead a country to try to make it better' rather than 'knock it down.' He described himself as a 'red Tory,' a moderate conservative, signaling a potential shift in the party\u2019s ideological direction. His move increased the Liberals\u2019 seat count to 170, while Jeneroux\u2019s resignation temporarily reduced the Opposition to 172 seats and opened a potentially winnable riding. Jeneroux denied coercion and stated he met with Liberal leader Mark Carney prior to his decision. The departures have raised questions about the future of the Conservative Party, especially if defections continue and public support declines. While some Conservatives criticized d'Entremont as a 'coward,' the broader debate around floor-crossing remains contested, with historical precedent and constitutional norms supporting MPs\u2019 individual agency.

Jeneroux cited family time as his reason, rejecting claims of political pressure, which were denied by Poilievre\u2019s adviser Jenni Byrne. Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer accused the Liberals of using 'undemocratic means' and 'pressure tactics' to undermine the opposition. Despite the defections, MP Roman Baber and strategist Kory Teneycke affirmed the caucus remained united, with Teneycke noting floor-crossings are common in minority governments but still acknowledged the loss as damaging. Poilievre, speaking at the Economic Club of Canada in Toronto, avoided addressing internal drama and instead criticized Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s $140-billion spending plan over five years, calling it a threat to future generations and harmful to business investment. He argued for eliminating both regulatory barriers and subsidies, stating, 'My view is, let's do neither. Let's stop blocking our entrepreneurs.'

Prime Minister Mark Carney joked about potential future defections, urging supporters to contact their local MPs. The government's budget passed two of three required confidence votes: on Thursday, the NDP and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois opposed a Conservative motion to reject the budget, and on Friday, Liberal MPs joined Conservatives in defeating a Bloc motion calling for rejection. The Liberals remain two votes short of a majority. The political instability followed the floor-crossing of Nova Scotia MP Chris d'Entremont to the Liberal caucus, citing dissatisfaction with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s leadership. His departure sparked backlash from former colleagues, including Andrew Scheer, who accused the Liberals of using 'undemocratic means' and 'pressure tactics' to destabilize the opposition. Late Thursday, Conservative MP Matt Jeneroux announced his resignation from Parliament, stating he had no coercion and that his decision was long-standing. He confirmed he had spoken with Poilievre and that his departure would likely occur in the spring. Liberal sources confirmed a private meeting between Carney and Jeneroux during question period, though Scheer denied the meeting occurred, claiming the Liberals were harassing Conservatives. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May declared the budget 'dead to me' but offered conditional support if stronger environmental commitments are added. The budget faces a final vote in the week of November 17, 2025, and the Liberals will need opposition abstentions or support to remain in power.

He emphasized that his decision was not influenced by pressure from within the Conservative Party and expressed deep respect for his colleagues, including leader Pierre Poilievre, with whom he had a positive conversation. Jeneroux, first elected in 2015, said he had hoped to contribute to Poilievre\u2019s vision but was disappointed by the election outcome. His resignation follows that of Nova Scotia MP Chris d'Entremont, who defected to the Liberals citing dissatisfaction with Poilievre\u2019s leadership. Poilievre publicly thanked Jeneroux for his service and suggested his official departure may be in spring 2026. Jeneroux confirmed his exit would occur 'this spring,' prompting a byelection in his Edmonton seat, which he won by a narrow five-point margin in April 2025. Conservative leadership has since worked to prevent further defections, including efforts by former campaign manager Jenni Byrne, and several MPs, including Quebec\u2019s Dominique Vien, have publicly reaffirmed their loyalty.

The news caused immediate chaos in the House of Commons, with MPs exchanging phones and reacting in shock during the vote, which ultimately failed. Jeneroux, who was not in Ottawa and abstained from voting on the opposition's subamendment, later clarified in two statements that his resignation was voluntary and driven by a desire to focus on family, with no coercion involved. Conservative MPs emphasized his personal reasons, distancing his departure from the recent floor-crossing of Chris D'Entremont, while Liberal officials suggested Poilievre's leadership style may be driving progressive MPs away. The resignation adds to Conservative Party instability, with Jeneroux being the second Conservative MP to resign in 48 hours. Meanwhile, the Liberal government is abandoning its comprehensive online harms bill, opting instead to split it into multiple legislative pieces across ministries, citing the need for more focused and effective legislation. Health Minister Marjorie Michel defended the culling of 300 ostriches on public health grounds after the Supreme Court of Canada rejected an appeal by Universal Ostrich Farms, despite public outcry and pressure from animal rights groups. The decision has sparked debate, with some Conservative MPs criticizing the CFIA\u2019s handling and lack of communication, while others, like Brad Vis, stressed that such decisions should be left to scientists.

The vote passed 198 to 139, with the Liberals, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, New Democrats, and the Green MP supporting the budget. The government treated the vote as a confidence matter, meaning defeat would have triggered a potential snap election. Jeneroux, who had previously denied defection rumors, did not confirm when he would resign but stated he would focus on family. Two days earlier, Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont had defected to the Liberals, increasing their seat count to 170\u2014two short of a majority. A Liberal source revealed the party had nearly convinced Jeneroux to cross the floor, though he ultimately chose not to. Jeneroux denied any pressure from Conservative leadership, including Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s office, which declined to confirm a meeting. Conservative insiders expressed disappointment, with one source criticizing Leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s leadership as too right-wing and lacking 'adults in the room,' citing Poilievre\u2019s recent criticism of the RCMP. The source described the caucus as 'subdued' and 'defeated' after d'Entremont\u2019s exit. Poilievre has not personally reached out to all MPs, according to the source, who said he has 'acquaintances, not friends.' Despite internal dissent, the source has no intention of leaving the party, hoping for a future leadership challenge. The Liberals now face a second confidence vote on Friday and a third on November 17, when the Bloc and likely the Greens will oppose the budget. The NDP, with seven members, could hold the balance of power; interim leader Don Davies has not yet declared their vote. The government needs 172 votes to pass the budget, but could succeed with fewer if opposition members abstain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 03:41 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/carney-government-survives-first-of-three-budget-votes-as-conservatives-face-another-mp-departure/article_8fbdc91d-040a-4ddf-aa37-d7fcdab56199.html)\n\n**Conservative MP announces resignation days after another crosses the floor**\nConservative MP Matt Jeneroux, representing Edmonton Riverbend, announced his resignation from Parliament, stating it was a difficult but necessary decision driven by his desire to spend more time with his family. His resignation follows the recent floor-crossing of Nova Scotia MP Chris d'Entremont to the Liberal Party, which left the Conservative government two seats short of a majority, jeopardizing its ability to pass the budget without opposition support. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre confirmed Jeneroux's departure would occur in spring 2026 and praised his decade of service. Jeneroux expressed admiration for all elected members of Parliament, stating their work sustains hope for a stronger, more unified Canada. He emphasized that his decision was not coerced and that he hopes to address the House of Commons one final time. Other Conservative MPs, including Garnett Genuis and Frank Caputo, publicly praised Jeneroux for his advocacy on mental health and the families affected by the downing of flight PS752. Quebec MP G\u00e9rard Deltell downplayed the significance of d'Entremont\u2019s departure, calling it isolated, while colleague Jacques Gourde remained uncertain about future defections. Jeneroux was first elected in 2015.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 03:21 AM\nSource:[coastreporter.net](https://www.coastreporter.net/national-news/conservative-mp-announces-resignation-days-after-another-crosses-the-floor-11457082)\n\n**Carney doesn't rule out more floor-crossing talks**\nChris d'Entremont, a Conservative MP representing a rural Nova Scotia riding with a military base and strong agricultural and fishery sectors, resigned from the Conservative caucus and joined the Liberals on November 5, 2025, following the release of Prime Minister Carney's budget. This floor-crossing brought Carney's government one step closer to a majority, now two seats away from securing a majority in the House of Commons. Carney stated that d'Entremont sought alignment between his values and the government's budget, which he found. The move was met with strong backlash from Conservatives: MP Aaron Gunn called it 'shameful,' MP Jamil Jivani labeled d'Entremont an 'idiot,' and the party accused him of betrayal. d'Entremont cited a lack of representation for his 'red Tory' and eastern Canadian ideals, stating that Pierre Poilievre's leadership style was incompatible with his values. He also referenced the awkwardness of not being backed by his caucus in his bid for deputy speaker earlier in the year, which he said contributed to his decision. Despite Conservative claims that the party is a 'big tent' welcoming centrist voices, d'Entremont emphasized that his progressive conservatism led to increasing alienation. Government Whip Mark Gerretsen confirmed that a seat has been reserved for d'Entremont in the House, specifically in the Liberal class of 2019. The Liberals have not disclosed whether they are pursuing additional floor-crossers. The Conservatives, while denying rumors of further defections, have been avoiding media and using back doors to enter caucus meetings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 04:57 PM\nSource:[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/chris-dentremont-mark-carney-conservative-liberal-defections-00637328)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the probability that another Canadian MP will defect or resign before January 1, 2026 is assessed as notably above the historical base rate, but with considerable uncertainty due to the short time window and recent party discipline efforts. All experts agree the recent back-to-back defection and resignation from the Conservative caucus, the minority Liberal government's proximity to a majority, the looming leadership review for Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, and active efforts by the Liberals to attract more defectors have sharply elevated the risk of further departures. Several experts stress that such instability can produce a 'contagion effect' or lower barriers for further floor-crossings. However, most note that the intense negative backlash and subsequent tightening of party discipline following the recent moves, combined with the approaching holidays and a limited number of sitting days, act as substantial deterrents. The likelihood is seen as highest in the next few weeks if a particularly dissatisfied or vulnerable MP is convinced to leave in exchange for incentives. Probability estimates range from 32% to 65%, with several clustering around the 35-45% mark and two (Rational Choice and Canadian Parliamentary Dynamics) just above 60%, reflecting the high uncertainty but real potential for one more significant move in this period. In summary, experts view the risk as materially increased by the current unique political context, but not a near-certainty, given historical patterns and present constraints.",
