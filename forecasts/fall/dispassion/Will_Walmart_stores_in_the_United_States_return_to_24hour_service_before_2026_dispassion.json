The company cites the closure as a way to 'say thank you' to employees, encouraging staff and customers to spend time with loved ones during the holiday. Stores will operate normally the day before Thanksgiving and reopen at 6 a.m. local time on Black Friday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 300 points, or 0.84%, closing at 45,752.26. The S&P 500 dropped 1.55% to 6,538.97, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.15% to 22,078.05. Although indices opened higher following strong earnings from chipmaker Nvidia and positive September employment data, they turned negative during the day. September non-farm employment rose by 119,000, exceeding expectations, but the unemployment rate increased from 4.3% to 4.4%. Initial jobless claims fell by 8,000 to 220,000 for the week ending November 15. Analysts noted that the strong employment data, which surpassed expectations, was the final report before the December 9\u201310 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, and that more recent data would be released afterward, reinforcing expectations that the Fed would likely hold rates steady. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the October employment report would not be released due to data collection disruptions during the government shutdown, and the November report\u2014originally planned for December 5\u2014was rescheduled to December 16. Federal Reserve officials also weighed in: Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack emphasized the need for a measured, mildly restrictive policy to reach the 2% inflation target. Fed Governor Michael Barr expressed concern that inflation remains around 3%, stating the 2% target remains a firm commitment. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that inflation progress may have stalled and could reverse, calling it unsettling. Nvidia\u2019s financial results, released after market close, showed revenue rose 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the quarter, surpassing market expectations. The company also raised its guidance for the current quarter to $65 billion. Despite a more than 4% gain at the start of the day, Nvidia shares ended the session down 2.9%. Walmart shares surged 6.5% after reporting third-quarter revenue and earnings above expectations and raising its full-year sales forecast.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[D\u00fcnya](https://www.dunya.com/finans/haberler/new-york-borsasi-dususle-kapandi-haberi-803965)\n\n**Thanksgiving Grocery, Black Friday Retail Hours: What's Open, Closed In MI**\nOn Thanksgiving Day, several major retail stores in Michigan, including Academy Sports + Outdoors, Apple, Army & Air Force Exchange Service, Ashley HomeStore, Banana Republic, Foot Locker, and others, were closed.

Major grocery chains such as Kroger and Albertsons have similarly made their pandemic\u2011era reduced hours permanent, with most stores closing at 10 or 11\u202fp.m.  Pharmacy chains Walgreens and CVS have cut hours at many former 24/7 sites because a nationwide shortage of pharmacists makes overnight operation unsafe.  National banks like Chase and Bank of America now often close their lobbies at 4 or 5\u202fp.m. instead of 6\u202fp.m. and have eliminated many Saturday hours, encouraging customers to use ATMs or online banking.  Fast\u2011food chains such as McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell have allowed franchise owners to shorten hours, and some 24/7 drive\u2011thrus have closed entirely.  Department stores including Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, once open until 10\u202fp.m. on weeknights, now typically close at 8 or 9\u202fp.m., reflecting a decline in evening foot traffic.  Home improvement giants Home\u202fDepot and Lowe\u2019s, which used to stay open until 10\u202fp.m., now frequently close at 9\u202fp.m.  The article attributes these shifts to a tight labor market and a major move toward online shopping, making the old 24/7 model unprofitable for most businesses.

The USPS announced on August 11 that all delivery units will be closed, and FedEx shipments will not be available. Banks such as Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo will be closed, and the Federal Reserve will not operate. School districts and universities will also close, as will all state and local offices. Pharmacies will remain open on September 1 but may have different hours, so customers should check individual store times. Costco will keep all its stores closed on Labor Day, as it does on other federal holidays like Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Reader's Digest lists several retailers that will remain open in Texas, including CVS, Walgreens, Aldi, Barnes & Noble, Home Depot, HomeGoods, IKEA, Kohl's, Lowe's, Macy's, Marshall's, Nordstrom, Petco, Sam's Club, Sears, Staples, Target, T.J.

The article notes that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, employees who work more than 40 hours in a week on a holiday are entitled to at least 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for overtime. Finally, it lists upcoming federal holidays: Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The article uses the phrase 'bajan la persiana' to describe businesses that close for 24 hours.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 30, 2025 10:49 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/texas/labor-day-2025-las-tiendas-que-cierran-y-abren-durante-el-dia-del-trabajo-en-texas-nid30082025/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts across fields including retail operations, corporate strategy, labor economics, business administration, microeconomics, and sociology converge on an extremely low probability that Walmart will return to 24-hour service at a majority of US stores before January 1, 2026. Their consensus is based on a variety of consistently negative factors: persistent labor shortages and wage pressures, diminished overnight consumer demand accelerated by a post-pandemic shift to online shopping, unfavorable cost-benefit calculations for overnight operations (due to low sales, high staffing and security costs), and clear industry-wide trends toward permanently reduced hours among major retailers with no competitor returning to 24/7 service. Experts also emphasize Walmart's repeated public statements reaffirming reduced hours and recent holiday schedules that double down on shorter operating periods. Path-dependence and institutionalization of the new model, combined with the short time remaining before the resolution date, make a major operational reversal virtually impossible absent a dramatic, unforeseen outside event. Final probability estimates are almost universally 1% (with one expert assigning a slightly less categorical 2%), all emphasizing that a 'Yes' outcome would require an unprecedented, unanticipated, and immediate catalyst not evidenced in any current reporting or signal. The status quo is deeply entrenched, and no expert finds credible evidence or incentive for abrupt change before 2026.",
