The UN's documentation efforts on Sudan signal potential for future legal action, but translating evidence-gathering into a formal case in the final days of December is operationally unlikely. End-of-year filing slowdowns further reduce the probability. That said, the volatility of the year and the trend toward legal forum shopping\u2014especially as the Security Council remains paralyzed\u2014mean that a last-minute filing cannot be completely ruled out, especially by a state seeking to make a diplomatic statement or to preemptively shape the legal narrative.

Importantly, you avoid over-weighting the geopolitical volatility, instead giving due consideration to the mutual consent barrier and bureaucratic inertia typical in late December. Your probability (13%) is justified as it modestly adjusts the base rate upwards without overstating tail risk, reflecting the nuanced interplay between structural barriers and exceptional diplomatic dynamics this year."

However, from a Comparative International Legal Culture perspective, your estimate (20%) may overstate the likelihood by underweighting informal legal-cultural norms and the strong procedural inertia typical in late December. While institutional gridlock can motivate symbolic filings, most states remain risk-averse regarding high-profile legal actions at year-end, preferring to mobilize such gestures at the start of a new year for increased visibility and bureaucratic ease. Furthermore, your reasoning could engage more directly with how legal culture shapes the strategic calculation of states: the reputational consequences of a failed or unripe case, reluctance to appear impulsive, and the practical holiday slowdowns all act as subtle but powerful deterrents to last-minute filings. Thus, while your upward adjustment is reasonable, a slightly lower probability, more anchored in the lived realities of international legal culture, would be more justified."

Established in 1945 after two world wars, the UN was designed to maintain peace, with initial membership of 51 countries growing to 193 today; Japan joined in 1956 following the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The UN has played a key role in refugee support, combating hunger and infectious diseases, and peacekeeping operations (PKO). However, the Security Council\u2014the UN\u2019s central body\u2014has suffered functional failure, particularly due to Russia\u2019s abandonment of its responsibilities by invading Ukraine. The Security Council\u2019s permanent members (the U.S., UK, France, China, and Russia) hold veto power, meaning any single country can block a resolution. This has led to repeated vetoes of ceasefire resolutions in Ukraine and Gaza, with Russia blocking Ukraine-related resolutions and the U.S. blocking Gaza-related ones. Despite the UN\u2019s membership expanding to nearly four times its original size, the Security Council remains at 15 members, including five permanent members. Reform proposals include expanding permanent membership and strengthening the General Assembly\u2019s authority, but such changes require consensus from the permanent members, who are largely resistant and protective of their privileges. The U.S., a founding force behind the UN, has shown little leadership in reform; former President Trump criticized the UN in September 2025, calling it a source of problems and reducing financial contributions. Japan, a long-standing advocate for Security Council reform alongside Germany, Brazil, and India, and the world\u2019s third-largest contributor to UN dues, is well-positioned to lead reform efforts. The article calls for broad multilateral cooperation to drive reform, emphasizing that the UN must evolve to meet the needs of new and developing nations, address organizational rigidity and budget inefficiencies, and serve as a unifying force in an increasingly divided world.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 09:27 PM\nSource:[\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b0\u805e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://www.nishinippon.co.jp/item/1431382/)\n\n**Al-Hishari\u2019s Transfer to ICC Sparks National and International Debate Over Accountability and Sovereignty in Libya**\nThe case of Libyan national Khaled Muhammad Ali Al-Hishari's transfer to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has intensified debate in Libya, with some viewing the move as essential for ending impunity, while others condemn it as an 'attack on national sovereignty.' Al-Hishari appeared before the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber I for the first time, renewing focus on the atrocities committed at the Mezitifa prison and the long-standing controversy over the ICC's jurisdiction in Libya. The ICC alleges he committed or oversaw crimes against humanity and war crimes\u2014including murder, torture, rape, and sexual violence\u2014between 2015 and 2020. The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) welcomed the transfer, calling it a 'crucial step toward justice' for victims, and emphasized the need for full cooperation from Libyan authorities, including access for investigators and enforcement of outstanding arrest warrants. Amnesty International described the transfer as a 'significant step toward accountability' and urged full compliance with the Rome Statute. In contrast, the Social Council of Sidi Ahmed al-Jadid (Sidi Friday) issued a strongly worded statement rejecting the transfer, accusing the Government of National Unity of 'abdicating Libya\u2019s judicial authority' and enabling foreign interference. The council labeled the act a 'national crime' and warned of potential public backlash, while questioning the government\u2019s legitimacy and sovereignty. The ICC\u2019s spokesperson, Fadi Al-Abdallah, confirmed the arrest was executed in Germany under a valid arrest warrant issued on July 10, 2025, and emphasized that Al-Hishari was a senior official at Mezitifa prison. The case marks a shift from years of inaction, as the ICC has recently issued new arrest warrants targeting security and military figures linked to systematic abuses in Libyan detention centers, particularly in Tripoli and eastern Libya under forces allied with Haftar. The transfer process included identity verification, notification of charges, and discussion of legal rights\u2014key steps before the next phase, which will involve evaluating preliminary evidence and scheduling hearings. The ICC is expected to rely on victim testimonies, verified human rights reports, and evidence provided by cooperating states. This development signals a new phase in international engagement with Libya\u2019s justice crisis, where enforcement of ICC warrants in Europe follows years of domestic non-cooperation. The Government of National Unity now faces a critical test balancing international accountability with national sovereignty amid a fragmented and non-unified judicial system. Analysts warn that Al-Hishari\u2019s case may be the first of a broader ICC campaign targeting figures across Libya, potentially deepening internal divisions if not managed with legal and political balance. The broader debate continues over Libya\u2019s transitional justice future, pitting victims\u2019 demands for truth and accountability against political demands for national judicial control and state sovereignty.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 07:53 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a](https://www.alquds.co.uk/%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D9%88/)\n\n**The age of unipolar diplomacy is coming to an end**\nThe article argues that the era of unipolar diplomacy, dominated by the United States, is ending due to systemic failures in international response to crises like the conflict in Gaza. The U.S. is criticized for selectively applying the rules-based international order\u2014supporting Ukraine while defending an occupation deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The absence of the U.S. from the G20 summit in South Africa symbolizes the declining credibility of unipolar authority. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, no political resolution has emerged, and Palestinians remain excluded from decision-making. The article critiques the 'master-key model' of diplomacy, where one superpower resolves conflicts through leverage, noting that this approach has failed to prevent genocide and entrenches settler-colonial logic. The transition to a multipolar world, marked by rising influence of the Global South, BRICS nations, and diplomatic hubs like Doha, presents both challenges and opportunities. Qatar\u2019s role as a mediator and South Africa\u2019s ICJ case exemplify shifting legitimacy. However, the recent UN Security Council resolution endorsing the U.S. Gaza plan\u2014passed under American pressure\u2014reveals the fragility of the new order, as economic interests still override decolonial principles. The article calls for a new diplomacy grounded in ideological honesty, multi-door dialogue, and accountability, rejecting dominance in favor of inclusive, pragmatic engagement. The future of peacebuilding lies not in a single master key, but in a multiplicity of approaches that recognize diverse power structures and prioritize justice over control.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/12/4/the-age-of-unipolar-diplomacy-is-coming-to-an-end)\n\n**The International Criminal Court Under Scrutiny: Can International Justice Restore Peace?**\nThe 24th session of the Assembly of States Parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) is scheduled to take place in The Hague, Netherlands, from December 1 to December 6, 2025. The article examines the role, effectiveness, and challenges of the ICC in restoring peace, addressing criticisms that it disproportionately targets African leaders. Established in 2002 under the Rome Statute ratified by 125 countries, the ICC is the first permanent international criminal court, with jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression. It operates on a principle of subsidiarity, intervening only when national courts are unwilling or unable to act. Since its creation, the ICC has opened investigations in 15 countries, primarily in Africa, though recent cases include Afghanistan, Palestine, Ukraine, and Venezuela. As of June 2025, 33 individuals under investigation were from Africa, with only one from the Philippines, and over half of ongoing investigations involved non-African states. Despite efforts, the ICC faces major obstacles: lack of cooperation from powerful states, limited resources, and prolonged proceedings\u2014averaging seven years\u2014due to difficulties accessing evidence and witnesses. The situation in Sudan exemplifies these challenges: despite multiple arrest warrants issued for Omar al-Bashir, Ahmad Harun, and others, none have been apprehended, and the court struggles to access conflict zones. In October 2025, the ICC convicted Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. However, the court has faced criticism for perceived geographic bias, especially from African states. In response, the ICC issued arrest warrants in 2023 against Russian President Vladimir Putin and in 2024 against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, challenging the narrative of selective prosecution. The article highlights that the ICC's future depends not on reform but on universal adherence to international law. The ICC\u2019s jurisdiction is defined by the Rome Statute, covering crimes such as murder, torture, sexual violence, deportation, persecution, and genocide, with aggression defined as the use of armed force by a state against another\u2019s sovereignty. The article concludes that while the ICC plays a vital role in combating impunity, its effectiveness is constrained by political, logistical, and legal limitations.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 06:47 AM\nSource:[TV5MONDE](https://information.tv5monde.com/afrique/video/la-cour-penale-internationale-critiquee-la-justice-internationale-peut-elle-aider-restaurer-la-paix-2797318)\n\n**Al-Hishari\u2019s First Appearance Before ICC: International Support Amid Domestic Controversy Over Libya\u2019s Sovereignty and Justice**\nKhalid Muhammad Ali Al-Hishari, a prominent Libyan militia commander known as 'Al-Buti', appeared before the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague on December 4, 2025, becoming the first Libyan suspect to face the court since the Libya file was opened in 2011. He is charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed between 2015 and 2020, including murder, torture, and rape, while serving as a senior official in the Deterrence Militia and overseeing the al-Meitiqa prison in Tripoli. The ICC's presiding judge, Julia Antonella Mottu, confirmed that Al-Hishari received a copy of the arrest warrant in Arabic and was informed of his legal rights under the Rome Statute. His transfer to the ICC was formally accepted from German authorities days prior. The move was welcomed by France, the UK, Denmark, South Korea, Slovenia, Sierra Leone, and other nations, who hailed it as a significant milestone in ICC accountability for Libya. However, domestic opposition emerged in Libya, notably from the Sidi Farj Social Council, which condemned the Government of National Unity for what it called 'national betrayal' in accepting ICC jurisdiction in May 2025. The council argued that Libya\u2019s domestic judiciary is capable of prosecuting such cases and warned of potential public backlash, holding the Prime Minister responsible for the decision\u2019s consequences. Legal expert Fajr Al-Geili clarified that the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction over Libya is valid despite Libya not being a party to the Rome Statute, citing UN Security Council Resolution 1970 (2011), which referred the situation to the ICC. He emphasized that Al-Hishari is not yet on trial, but undergoing an initial appearance before the Pre-Trial Chamber, which functions as a judicial investigator with powers to issue arrest warrants, release suspects, and manage charges. Al-Geili also noted that six other suspects are under investigation, and Al-Hishari\u2019s detention could trigger further investigations into additional perpetrators, marking a long judicial path for Libya. He stressed the importance of the ICC process in ensuring justice for victims and preventing impunity, especially for powerful or politically protected individuals, citing a past case where a suspect was released in Italy and transferred by private plane to Libya despite an ICC arrest warrant\u2014a move described as a 'stain on the reputation of a G7 nation'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 05:34 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/al-hishri-libyan-international-criminal-court)\n\n**Arbitration Matters Bulletin: December 2025**\nThe December 2025 edition of the Arbitration Matters Bulletin from DLA Piper's International Arbitration Group highlights key global arbitration developments. The Arbitration Act 2025 in England entered into force, introducing significant reforms: a default rule that the law of the arbitral seat governs if the agreement is silent on governing law; an express power for arbitrators to issue summary awards; and clarified time limits for challenging awards in English courts. Chloe Mears of DLA Piper notes these reforms reinforce London\u2019s status as a leading arbitral seat. The bulletin also covers the Ciarb Guideline on Third-Party Funding (TPF), which clarifies funding mechanisms, disclosure, conflicts, and cost recovery, with Mapanza Nkwilimba highlighting TPF\u2019s role in mitigating insolvency risks. The EU has reached an inter se agreement, endorsed by all member states except Hungary, confirming that the Energy Charter Treaty\u2019s (ECT) dispute settlement clause does not apply to intra-EU investment disputes, reinforcing the Komstroy judgment. David Kohegyi notes this undermines the enforceability of such awards in the EU. China\u2019s Arbitration Law amendments, effective 1 March 2026, introduce the first statutory definition of the 'seat of arbitration', strengthen the doctrine of separability, and align Chinese practice with international norms. Kelvin Chen states these changes bring legal certainty. The AAA-ICDR launched an AI arbitrator for construction disputes, trained on 1,500 awards and tested by experienced arbitrators; it generates draft awards for human review. Alice Adu Gyamfi warns of ongoing concerns regarding enforceability and bias in AI-generated awards. The Abu Dhabi Global Market Court affirmed its jurisdiction to issue anti-suit injunctions (ASIs) to enforce arbitration agreements, though it denied relief where the applicant failed to prove a 'high degree of probability' of a valid agreement. Celia Johnson-Morgan emphasizes the importance of meeting procedural thresholds. Finally, an ICSID tribunal ruled Peru liable for acts of the Par\u00e1n Community, which blocked and seized a Canadian gold mine, finding the community an organ of the state under customary international law. Barry Fletcher calls the decision a 'world first' and a significant precedent for future investor-state disputes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 12:29 PM\nSource:[Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f5e35ee7-1645-4c4f-8152-970fa21f37d0)\n\n**UN Documents Reveal War Crimes in Sudan and Propel International Judicial Pathway**\nThe United Nations has revealed that its teams have been conducting a comprehensive and detailed 'documentation workshop' on all atrocities committed against civilians since the outbreak of fighting in mid-April 2023 in Sudan. The UN announced its intent to transform this data into conclusive evidence to pave the way for an international judicial process, citing the 'severe collapse' of national justice institutions in Sudan. This move signals a potential transfer of the Sudanese conflict case to international courts, with the UN warning of breaking the 'cycle of impunity' and emphasizing the failure of local justice mechanisms.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 05:01 AM\nSource:[\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a](https://royanews.tv/news/367343)\n\n**Legal and Prosecutorial Collaboration Advances Substantive Resolution of Administrative Disputes in China**\nThe joint efforts of China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) and Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) have significantly advanced the substantive resolution of administrative disputes, addressing the persistent issue of 'case closed but matters unresolved' in the legal system. Since 2019, under the support of courts and administrative agencies, procuratorates across China have facilitated the substantive resolution of over 65,000 administrative disputes, including more than 3,400 cases lasting over 10 years, effectively addressing many urgent public concerns. The SPP and SPC, together with eight departments including the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, Ministry of Natural Resources, and Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, have established a '3+N' mechanism for preventing and resolving administrative disputes. According to Geng Baojian, a member of the SPC's Judicial Committee and head of the Administrative Trial Division, from January to September 2025, nationwide administrative trial appeal rates dropped by 5.23 percentage points, retrial application rates fell by 2.83 percentage points, and case closure rates within statutory time limits reached 94.43%, up 1.68 percentage points year-on-year. The SPP released six model cases, including 'Wu v. the Street Office of a County in Zhejiang Province over demolition management administrative enforcement,' selected from over 100 high-quality cases across the country in 2024. These cases demonstrate that dispute resolution is based on accurate factual findings and consistent legal application, not 'mediation without clear fault.' Geng emphasized that courts and procuratorates play distinct but complementary roles, with joint efforts driven by empathy and a 'putting oneself in the plaintiff\u2019s shoes' approach, effectively achieving 'case closure and matter resolution' and promoting social harmony.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 02:27 AM\nSource:[\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51](http://yn.people.com.cn/n2/2025/1204/c361322-41431638.html)\n\n**80 Years of the UN: Security Council Reform Is Imperative**\nThe United Nations (UN) marked its 80th anniversary in October 2025, but its ability to resolve international conflicts has significantly declined, necessitating urgent reform. Established in 1945 after two world wars, the UN was designed to maintain peace, with initial membership of 51 countries growing to 193 today; Japan joined in 1956 following the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The UN has played a key role in refugee support, combating hunger and infectious diseases, and peacekeeping operations (PKO). However, the Security Council\u2014the UN\u2019s central body\u2014has suffered functional failure, particularly due to Russia\u2019s abandonment of its responsibilities by invading Ukraine. The Security Council\u2019s permanent members (the U.S., UK, France, China, and Russia) hold veto power, meaning any single country can block a resolution. This has led to repeated vetoes of ceasefire resolutions in Ukraine and Gaza, with Russia blocking Ukraine-related resolutions and the U.S. blocking Gaza-related ones. Despite the UN\u2019s membership expanding to nearly four times its original size, the Security Council remains at 15 members, including five permanent members. Reform proposals include expanding permanent membership and strengthening the General Assembly\u2019s authority, but such changes require consensus from the permanent members, who are largely resistant and protective of their privileges. The U.S., a founding force behind the UN, has shown little leadership in reform; former President Trump criticized the UN in September 2025, calling it a source of problems and reducing financial contributions. Japan, a long-standing advocate for Security Council reform alongside Germany, Brazil, and India, and the world\u2019s third-largest contributor to UN dues, is well-positioned to lead reform efforts. The article calls for broad multilateral cooperation to drive reform, emphasizing that the UN must evolve to meet the needs of new and developing nations, address organizational rigidity and budget inefficiencies, and serve as a unifying force in an increasingly divided world.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 09:27 PM\nSource:[\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b0\u805e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://www.nishinippon.co.jp/item/1431382/)\n\n**Al-Hishari\u2019s Transfer to ICC Sparks National and International Debate Over Accountability and Sovereignty in Libya**\nThe case of Libyan national Khaled Muhammad Ali Al-Hishari's transfer to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has intensified debate in Libya, with some viewing the move as essential for ending impunity, while others condemn it as an 'attack on national sovereignty.' Al-Hishari appeared before the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber I for the first time, renewing focus on the atrocities committed at the Mezitifa prison and the long-standing controversy over the ICC's jurisdiction in Libya. The ICC alleges he committed or oversaw crimes against humanity and war crimes\u2014including murder, torture, rape, and sexual violence\u2014between 2015 and 2020. The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) welcomed the transfer, calling it a 'crucial step toward justice' for victims, and emphasized the need for full cooperation from Libyan authorities, including access for investigators and enforcement of outstanding arrest warrants. Amnesty International described the transfer as a 'significant step toward accountability' and urged full compliance with the Rome Statute. In contrast, the Social Council of Sidi Ahmed al-Jadid (Sidi Friday) issued a strongly worded statement rejecting the transfer, accusing the Government of National Unity of 'abdicating Libya\u2019s judicial authority' and enabling foreign interference. The council labeled the act a 'national crime' and warned of potential public backlash, while questioning the government\u2019s legitimacy and sovereignty. The ICC\u2019s spokesperson, Fadi Al-Abdallah, confirmed the arrest was executed in Germany under a valid arrest warrant issued on July 10, 2025, and emphasized that Al-Hishari was a senior official at Mezitifa prison. The case marks a shift from years of inaction, as the ICC has recently issued new arrest warrants targeting security and military figures linked to systematic abuses in Libyan detention centers, particularly in Tripoli and eastern Libya under forces allied with Haftar. The transfer process included identity verification, notification of charges, and discussion of legal rights\u2014key steps before the next phase, which will involve evaluating preliminary evidence and scheduling hearings. The ICC is expected to rely on victim testimonies, verified human rights reports, and evidence provided by cooperating states. This development signals a new phase in international engagement with Libya\u2019s justice crisis, where enforcement of ICC warrants in Europe follows years of domestic non-cooperation. The Government of National Unity now faces a critical test balancing international accountability with national sovereignty amid a fragmented and non-unified judicial system. Analysts warn that Al-Hishari\u2019s case may be the first of a broader ICC campaign targeting figures across Libya, potentially deepening internal divisions if not managed with legal and political balance. The broader debate continues over Libya\u2019s transitional justice future, pitting victims\u2019 demands for truth and accountability against political demands for national judicial control and state sovereignty.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 07:53 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a](https://www.alquds.co.uk/%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D9%88/)\n\n**The age of unipolar diplomacy is coming to an end**\nThe article argues that the era of unipolar diplomacy, dominated by the United States, is ending due to systemic failures in international response to crises like the conflict in Gaza. The U.S. is criticized for selectively applying the rules-based international order\u2014supporting Ukraine while defending an occupation deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The absence of the U.S. from the G20 summit in South Africa symbolizes the declining credibility of unipolar authority. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, no political resolution has emerged, and Palestinians remain excluded from decision-making. The article critiques the 'master-key model' of diplomacy, where one superpower resolves conflicts through leverage, noting that this approach has failed to prevent genocide and entrenches settler-colonial logic. The transition to a multipolar world, marked by rising influence of the Global South, BRICS nations, and diplomatic hubs like Doha, presents both challenges and opportunities. Qatar\u2019s role as a mediator and South Africa\u2019s ICJ case exemplify shifting legitimacy. However, the recent UN Security Council resolution endorsing the U.S. Gaza plan\u2014passed under American pressure\u2014reveals the fragility of the new order, as economic interests still override decolonial principles. The article calls for a new diplomacy grounded in ideological honesty, multi-door dialogue, and accountability, rejecting dominance in favor of inclusive, pragmatic engagement. The future of peacebuilding lies not in a single master key, but in a multiplicity of approaches that recognize diverse power structures and prioritize justice over control.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/12/4/the-age-of-unipolar-diplomacy-is-coming-to-an-end)\n\n**US Sanctions Target ICC Judges: Court Faces Pressure Amid Ongoing Investigations**\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) President Judge Tomoko Akane announced that the United States (U.S.) has imposed sanctions on nine senior court officials, including six ICC judges, significantly impacting their financial activities in ICC member states, including Europe. Speaking at the 24th session of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP), Akane emphasized that the sanctions, which have disrupted personal and family lives, are part of a broader effort by the U.S. and external threats to undermine the ICC\u2019s independence, integrity, and security. She reaffirmed the Court\u2019s unwavering commitment to neutrality and adherence solely to the Rome Statute and international law. Akane stated that the ICC has implemented secret measures to strengthen itself against these pressures, asserting that no external pressure will ever be accepted. She also revealed that Russia has prepared indictments against ICC judges and officials, with ongoing secret trials that pose a direct threat to their personal security. Despite challenges, the ICC reported significant progress in investigations and prosecutions related to crimes in Sudan, Uganda, and the Philippines. ICC Deputy Prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang highlighted that 2025 saw a record number of arrest warrants issued, including the transfer of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Halid Mohamed Ali El Hi\u015fri from Germany. Sanctions have also affected civil society partners, with the closure of ICC offices in Caracas, Venezuela, to improve resource efficiency. Deputy Prosecutor Nazhat Shamim Khan confirmed that the Palestine investigation continues and remains unaffected by U.S. sanctions. The ASP session proceeded amid uncertainty, as the investigation into ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan remains unresolved, with no update on the OIOS report\u2019s delay. The prolonged ambiguity, coupled with Khan\u2019s ongoing leave since May, has created internal instability, with senior officials acting in a temporary capacity.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 08:36 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/haber/haber-abd-den-ucm-yargiclarina-yaptirim-19321718/)\n\n**The International Criminal Court Under Scrutiny: Can International Justice Restore Peace?**\nThe 24th session of the Assembly of States Parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) is scheduled to take place in The Hague, Netherlands, from December 1 to December 6, 2025. The article examines the role, effectiveness, and challenges of the ICC in restoring peace, addressing criticisms that it disproportionately targets African leaders. Established in 2002 under the Rome Statute ratified by 125 countries, the ICC is the first permanent international criminal court, with jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression. It operates on a principle of subsidiarity, intervening only when national courts are unwilling or unable to act. Since its creation, the ICC has opened investigations in 15 countries, primarily in Africa, though recent cases include Afghanistan, Palestine, Ukraine, and Venezuela. As of June 2025, 33 individuals under investigation were from Africa, with only one from the Philippines, and over half of ongoing investigations involved non-African states. Despite efforts, the ICC faces major obstacles: lack of cooperation from powerful states, limited resources, and prolonged proceedings\u2014averaging seven years\u2014due to difficulties accessing evidence and witnesses. The situation in Sudan exemplifies these challenges: despite multiple arrest warrants issued for Omar al-Bashir, Ahmad Harun, and others, none have been apprehended, and the court struggles to access conflict zones. In October 2025, the ICC convicted Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. However, the court has faced criticism for perceived geographic bias, especially from African states. In response, the ICC issued arrest warrants in 2023 against Russian President Vladimir Putin and in 2024 against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, challenging the narrative of selective prosecution. The article highlights that the ICC's future depends not on reform but on universal adherence to international law. The ICC\u2019s jurisdiction is defined by the Rome Statute, covering crimes such as murder, torture, sexual violence, deportation, persecution, and genocide, with aggression defined as the use of armed force by a state against another\u2019s sovereignty. The article concludes that while the ICC plays a vital role in combating impunity, its effectiveness is constrained by political, logistical, and legal limitations.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 06:47 AM\nSource:[TV5MONDE](https://information.tv5monde.com/afrique/video/la-cour-penale-internationale-critiquee-la-justice-internationale-peut-elle-aider-restaurer-la-paix-2797318)\n\n**Al-Hishari\u2019s First Appearance Before ICC: International Support Amid Domestic Controversy Over Libya\u2019s Sovereignty and Justice**\nKhalid Muhammad Ali Al-Hishari, a prominent Libyan militia commander known as 'Al-Buti', appeared before the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague on December 4, 2025, becoming the first Libyan suspect to face the court since the Libya file was opened in 2011. He is charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed between 2015 and 2020, including murder, torture, and rape, while serving as a senior official in the Deterrence Militia and overseeing the al-Meitiqa prison in Tripoli. The ICC's presiding judge, Julia Antonella Mottu, confirmed that Al-Hishari received a copy of the arrest warrant in Arabic and was informed of his legal rights under the Rome Statute. His transfer to the ICC was formally accepted from German authorities days prior. The move was welcomed by France, the UK, Denmark, South Korea, Slovenia, Sierra Leone, and other nations, who hailed it as a significant milestone in ICC accountability for Libya. However, domestic opposition emerged in Libya, notably from the Sidi Farj Social Council, which condemned the Government of National Unity for what it called 'national betrayal' in accepting ICC jurisdiction in May 2025.

China acknowledged it could not influence the outcome due to the absence of veto power and Western pressure. In a surprising move, Moscow endorsed Rafael Grossi, head of the IAEA, for UN Secretary-General in 2026, a decision hailed by Chinese analysts as a strategic shift that could challenge Western dominance and accelerate multipolarity. Meanwhile, former Ukrainian presidential press secretary Julia Mendelev revealed that former head of the Office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Andriy Yermak, had immense power, sabotaged orders, and harbored presidential ambitions, calling him 'the most dangerous person.' Her statement, possibly aimed at deflecting blame from Zelenskyy, coincided with U.S. pressure to remove Yermak as a 'hawkish' figure. In a separate development, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff\u2019s visit to Moscow was marked by a notably positive tone\u2014his warmth and openness toward Putin, contrasted with his cold demeanor toward Ukrainian officials\u2014signaling a potential shift in U.S. policy toward Russia and a cooler stance toward Ukraine under the Trump administration. In healthcare, Russia faces a growing crisis as migrant doctors reportedly prioritize religious practices over patient care: in one case, a radiologist delayed exams for children until after performing namaz, prompting public outrage.

Following the EU's sixth sanctions package in June 2022, these reserves were frozen without a clear international legal framework. While freezing assets during conflicts is not unprecedented\u2014seen in cases involving Iran, Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and Libya under Gaddafi\u2014this case lacks binding legal precedent. The article argues that the EU\u2019s current plan to use these funds for a 140-billion-euro 'loan' to Ukraine, structured as a zero-coupon bond contingent on Russia making reparations, constitutes de facto confiscation. This would violate international law, as state assets enjoy immunity and cannot be transferred without consent or a UN Security Council mandate. Legal experts cited in the article assert that Russia would have strong chances of success in multiple courts: Belgian courts (including the Cour de Cassation), the European Court of Justice, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, and international arbitration bodies like ICSID and UNCITRAL. The article criticizes the SPIEGEL for claiming it is 'unlikely' Russia would win in court, calling this view unsupported by legal experts. It further warns that if Russia sues, Belgium\u2014acting under EU direction\u2014would be liable, potentially leading to massive financial burdens on EU member states, particularly Germany and France.

Despite the UNSC's legal mandate under Article 27 of the UN Charter requiring consensus among the five permanent members (P5), the use of the veto\u2014particularly by the U.S.\u2014undermines the Council\u2019s normative legitimacy, as it contradicts the Charter\u2019s core purpose of maintaining international peace and security under Article 1(1). This paralysis has led to a decline in the Council\u2019s credibility, especially among Global South nations, and spurred alternative mechanisms: the UN General Assembly\u2019s Uniting for Peace resolution (Resolution 377A(V)), emergency special sessions, the Human Rights Council\u2019s fact-finding missions, regional organizations (e.g., AU, EU), the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the International Criminal Court (ICC), humanitarian mediation, and universal jurisdiction in national courts. The ICC\u2019s arrest warrant for the Israeli Prime Minister remains unenforced due to structural weaknesses: Israel is not a Rome Statute party, the ICC lacks an enforcement body, and powerful states avoid cooperation due to political pressure. Additionally, head-of-state immunity and double standards in enforcement\u2014such as the swift action against African leaders versus delayed responses to Western-aligned officials\u2014exacerbate perceptions of selective justice. In the post-ceasefire phase, the most realistic accountability pathways involve a multi-pronged strategy: leveraging the UN Human Rights Council\u2019s Independent Commission of Inquiry (COI) for evidence collection, feeding that evidence into ICC investigations, pursuing universal jurisdiction cases in European and Latin American courts, and sustaining ICJ proceedings. Despite the absence of a binding enforcement mechanism, coordinated political, legal, and diplomatic pressure offers the best prospect for meaningful accountability. The article concludes that without a supranational authority and with state sovereignty and power politics prevailing, international legal judgments remain symbolic rather than coercive, rendering ceasefires without enforcement ineffective in a system defined by unequal power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 08:29 AM\nSource:[Mehr News Agency](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/238362/Paralyzed-UNSC-and-legal-pathways-to-sustain-peace)\n\n**The UN at 80: The Superpowers Have No Clothes**\nThe article 'The UN at 80: The Superpowers Have No Clothes' argues that the United Nations, now 80 years old, operates under a outdated structure that no longer reflects the current global reality. The UN was founded in 1946 by a small group of victorious Allied nations, establishing institutions like the Security Council, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the World Bank, and the IMF to maintain peace and development. While the UN has expanded its mandate to include sustainable development, gender equality, and inclusive governance, it has failed to adapt quickly enough to today\u2019s geopolitical shifts. The article highlights the erosion of democratic governance in key global powers: the United States faces democratic backsliding, France has had six Prime Ministers in two years by mid-October 2025, and the UK continues to grapple with post-Brexit instability. The UN Security Council\u2019s veto power\u2014intended to prevent superpower conflict\u2014has instead enabled dominant nations to block resolutions that challenge their interests. Notably, the U.S. has vetoed over 50 Security Council resolutions critical of Israel in the past five decades and blocked ceasefire demands in Gaza. In contrast, South Africa has brought a case against Israel to the ICJ. The U.S. also abstained from voting on a 2010 UN resolution declaring water a human right, underscoring the Security Council\u2019s alignment with the material interests of powerful states. The article notes a significant shift: by 2026, major UN agencies like UNICEF, UNFPA, and UN Women may relocate to Nairobi, Kenya, marking the end of the Global North\u2019s 80-year dominance over international institutions. Meanwhile, Small Island Developing States are leading on climate action, while the U.S. reneges on climate commitments and denies global warming. The article concludes that the UN\u2019s inability to act decisively on climate change, gender equality, and conflict reflects a global order adrift. With Western liberalism crumbling under autocracy, inequality, and corruption, the article calls for a radical new global architecture\u2014led by the Global South\u2014to replace the current system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 12:22 PM\nSource:[Fair Observer](https://www.fairobserver.com/world-news/us-news/the-un-at-80-the-superpowers-have-no-clothes/)\n\n**The End of the Rules-Based Order: How Gaza Exposed the Limits of International Law**\nThe article 'The End of the Rules-Based Order: How Gaza Exposed the Limits of International Law' analyzes the failure of international legal institutions to prevent or respond to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. As of October 2025, over 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, with the vast majority being civilians, according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR, 2025). Despite extensive documentation of potential war crimes and genocide by organizations including OHCHR, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International, the United Nations Security Council repeatedly blocked ceasefire resolutions due to U.S. and UK vetoes. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a provisional order acknowledging a 'plausible risk of genocide' but lacked enforcement power. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation but has not issued any arrest warrants, highlighting its dependence on state cooperation. The article argues that the Gaza conflict represents a 'live-streamed war of annihilation' with unprecedented transparency, yet accountability remains absent. Western democracies, including the U.S., Germany, and the UK, continued to supply military aid to Israel, invoking 'self-defense' despite civilian casualties. The article concludes that the international legal order has entered a phase of irreversible decline, marked by structural power asymmetries, selective enforcement, and the erosion of universal norms. Legal scholars such as Martti Koskenniemi and David Kennedy describe the system as a 'theatre of legitimacy without enforcement,' where law functions more as a discourse of power than a mechanism of justice. The crisis of credibility, bureaucratic paralysis, and the 'crisis of witnessing'\u2014where evidence is abundant but action is absent\u2014have led to an existential crisis in international law. The article calls for fundamental structural reforms, including democratization of global governance and enforcement mechanisms, or else the system risks a slow decay into irrelevance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@zdmbhzg/the-end-of-the-rules-based-order-how-gaza-exposed-the-limits-of-international-law-50069b060c37)\n\n**Mali Appeals to International Courts and Allies After Algeria Rejects ICJ Jurisdiction Over Drone Downing Incident**\nThe relationship between Mali (Bamako) and Algeria has escalated into a serious crisis following Algeria's refusal to recognize the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in a case concerning the downing of a Malian surveillance drone. The incident occurred on the night of March 31 to April 1, 2025, when Algerian forces shot down a Turkish-made 'Bayraktar Akinci' drone near the sensitive Tinzaouatene border region. Mali asserts the drone never entered Algerian airspace, claiming wreckage was found 9.5 kilometers inside Malian territory, supported by flight data. Algeria, however, maintained the drone violated its sovereignty. Mali formally requested ICJ intervention on September 4, and the court acknowledged receipt on September 16, but emphasized it can only proceed with mutual consent\u2014something Algeria has refused, blocking the process. The dispute escalated at the United Nations on September 26, when Mali\u2019s Prime Minister, Abdoulaye Ma\u00efga, accused Algeria of repeated interference. Algeria\u2019s Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf responded with criticism, but Mali interpreted Algeria\u2019s refusal as evidence of political and diplomatic confusion. In response, Bamako is seeking support from strategic allies, including Russia and the 'Sahel Coalition' (comprising Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso), as well as international bodies such as the African Union, the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, and the AU Peace and Security Council. The article notes that prior cases\u2014such as those between Libya and Chad, the U.S. and Nicaragua, and Qatar and Bahrain\u2014proceeded despite similar jurisdictional objections, indicating that Mali may pursue legal action regardless of Algeria\u2019s stance. The conflict remains frozen due to Algeria\u2019s intransigence, compelling Mali to mobilize international diplomatic channels to counter what it describes as provocative actions by Algeria.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 11:57 AM\nSource:[\u0647\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0633](https://ar.hibapress.com/details-663070.html)\n\n**Mali\u2011Algeria: ICJ Stalled, Bamako Condemns**\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) is currently unable to proceed with the case between Mali and Algeria over a drone that was destroyed near their shared border. Mali filed its complaint on 16 September 2025, but Algeria has refused to accept the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, creating a procedural dead\u2011lock that Bamako deems unjust. The dispute centers on a Malian drone that was shot down in the Tinzaouaten area, which Mali says was on its own territory, while Algeria argues the drone crossed its border and that the shoot\u2011down was a justified act of self\u2011defence. The tension is compounded by Mali\u2019s challenge to the 2015 Algeria Accord, a pact aimed at stabilising the northern region, which has already strained relations. On 19 September 2025 the ICJ issued a statement saying \u2018 aucune mesure ne sera prise dans la proc\u00e9dure tant que l'Alg\u00e9rie n'aura pas consenti \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour \u2019, confirming that the case cannot be heard until Algeria formally accepts jurisdiction. Mali accuses Algeria of a \u2018d\u00e9ni de justice\u2019 and seeks diplomatic pressure or regional mediation to force a resolution. The situation highlights the limits of international law when a state rejects judicial authority and underscores how a single aerial incident can evolve into a major diplomatic crisis in a fragile border zone.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 07:14 AM\nSource:[La Nouvelle Tribune](https://lanouvelletribune.info/2025/09/mali-algerie-la-cij-bloquee-bamako-denonce/)\n\n**International Law Advances Amid Condemnations and Limitations**\nThe article reports on the role of the United Nations (UN) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in advancing modern international law, citing humanitarian lawyer Daniela\u202fKallas. It notes that the UN Charter\u2019s first chapter states the goal to \"promover o desenvolvimento progressivo do direito internacional\" and to ensure treaty obligations are respected. Kallas highlights the ICC, based in The Hague, as a global effort to institutionalise justice by holding individuals accountable for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression, while acknowledging that the path to justice is \"bem longo e cheio de desafios pol\u00edticos\". The piece explains that 125 countries have ratified the Rome Statute, yet the ICC\u2019s effectiveness is limited by the veto power of the five permanent Security Council members (US, Russia, China, France, UK), which can block decisions and impede the application of international law. It also discusses the erosion of multilateralism, regional disputes, and national resistance that hinder cooperation needed to prosecute and sentence offenders. The article recounts the ICC\u2019s history: ad\u2011hoc tribunals for Rwanda (1994) and the former Yugoslavia (1991\u20111995) led to the permanent ICC in 1998, which has since convicted 11 individuals\u20148 Congolese and 5 from the same Ituri conflict. It cites the 24\u2011year trial of former Yugoslav leaders and the case of Jean\u2011Pierre\u202fBemba\u202fGombo, who was acquitted of serious crimes but convicted of obstruction of justice. Kallas argues that the ICC reflects the evolution of international law from a system prioritising state sovereignty to one that places human protection above state will. The article presents these facts in a neutral tone, providing direct quotes such as \"Quando pot\u00eancias militares importantes n\u00e3o temem consequ\u00eancias por n\u00e3o aderirem ao Tribunal Penal Internacional, ou possuem poder de veto no Conselho de Seguran\u00e7a, como garantir a justi\u00e7a nesses casos?\" and \"bem longo e cheio de desafios pol\u00edticos\".\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Poder360](https://www.poder360.com.br/poder-internacional/direito-internacional-avanca-entre-condenacoes-e-limitacoes/)\n\n**International Court of Justice: Mali files case against Algeria, Algeria denounces 'maneuver'**\nOn 16 September 2025, Mali filed a request with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Algeria, alleging that Algerian forces destroyed a Malian reconnaissance drone during the night of 31 March\u20111 April 2025 while it was conducting a surveillance mission over Malian territory.  Mali describes the incident as a \"act hostile\" and an \"aggression\", claiming it violates the UN Charter, the African Union Charter, and the 2005 Mutual Non\u2011Aggression and Defence Pact.  The ICJ will only proceed if Algeria accepts the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, as required by Article\u202f40 of the Statute and Article\u202f38 of the Rules.  Algeria, in a statement released on 19 September, rejects Mali\u2019s version, asserting the drone had entered Algerian airspace and that its interception was a \"protection l\u00e9gitime de la souverainet\u00e9 nationale\".  The Algerian foreign ministry also denounced Mali\u2019s action as a \"man\u0153uvre grossi\u00e8re\" and accused the country of \"instrumentaliser\" the ICJ to avoid addressing internal crises, stating it would \"en temps opportun\" notify the Court of its refusal to recognize the procedure.  The ICJ, based in The Hague, was established in 1945, has 15 judges elected for nine\u2011year terms, and adjudicates international legal disputes.  The case highlights rising diplomatic tension between Mali and Algeria, two neighboring Sahel states with a shared border.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 12:40 PM\nSource:[RT en Fran\u00e7ais](https://francais.rt.com/afrique/125484-cour-internationale-justice-mali-porte-algerie)\n\n**Justice: The ICJ Confirms Mali's Case Against Algeria**\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) was notified on Tuesday 16 September 2025 of a request filed by Bamako. Mali had already announced on 4 September that it had brought a case against Algeria over the destruction of one of its military drones. In a communiqu\u00e9 from the ICJ, it was stated that \"Cet acte hostile de l'Alg\u00e9rie \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du territoire malien constitue une violation manifeste du principe de non-recours \u00e0 la force et un acte d'agression\u2026\". The case is currently pending because, under the Court\u2019s rules, the respondent state \u2013 Algeria \u2013 must acknowledge the Court\u2019s jurisdiction before proceedings can begin. The ICJ, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, was established in 1945, has been seated at the Palais de la Paix in The Hague since 1946, and is composed of 15 judges elected for nine\u2011year terms by the UN General Assembly and Security Council. Its mission is to resolve legal disputes between states in accordance with international law and to provide advisory opinions on legal questions referred by UN organs or other authorized bodies.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[MALIWEB](https://www.maliweb.net/societe/justice/justice-la-cij-confirme-un-dossier-du-mali-contre-lalgerie-3109418.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts across legal, diplomatic, and political domains overwhelmingly assess that it is unlikely a sixth contentious case will be opened at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2025. Their forecasts generally cluster in the single-digit to low-twenties percent probability range, with the lowest estimate at 4% and the highest at 21%. Nearly all experts cite the historical base rate: the ICJ averages 2-5 contentious cases per year, and five have already been filed in 2025\u2014making another filing statistically less likely. Procedural and jurisdictional barriers, especially the requirement of state consent, are repeatedly highlighted as strong constraints, with the Mali-Algeria dispute provided as a clear example of stalling due to lack of consent. Experts note that December is typically a quiet month for ICJ case openings due to administrative slowdowns and the holiday period, further reducing the likelihood of new cases. However, most experts note that 2025 has been an unusually active and turbulent year for international disputes, which raises the baseline risk of a surprise late filing. Yet, there is no public signal or news of an imminent new case, and practical, procedural, and institutional inertia at year-end weigh against a last-minute case. Experts generally agree that while the unprecedentedly high case load and current international tensions slightly increase the odds above historical norms, the most plausible outcome is that the number of contentious cases opened in 2025 will remain at five.",
