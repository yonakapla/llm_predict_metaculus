Vietnam's GDP growth reached 8.23% in Q3 2025 compared to the same period last year, with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh announcing a target of 8% GDP growth for 2025 and over 10% for 2026. In contrast, India's economic growth has slowed, with a projected 2025 fiscal year growth rate of 6.3% to 6.8%, according to the Indian Finance Ministry, and the Reserve Bank of India estimating 6.8%. India recorded a trade deficit of $41.68 billion (NT$1.31 trillion) in October 2025, and its exports to the U.S. declined by 11.8% year-on-year due to a 50% tariff imposed by the U.S. under the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Vietnam secured a trade agreement with the U.S. in July 2025, reducing tariffs on its exports from 46% to 20%. This policy shift is cited as a key reason for Vietnam's economic outperformance. India responded by launching a $500 million export relief package and seeking new trade partners for textiles, food processing, leather, and seafood. It also plans to sign a liquefied petroleum gas procurement agreement with U.S. energy companies, purchasing 2.2 million tons annually, to strengthen bilateral trade ties.

Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh stated that the country aims for a GDP growth rate of 8% in 2025, with plans to reach 10% in 2026. The strong performance is driven by robust manufacturing and exports, with industrial output rising 9.92% in the first nine months of 2025 and exports reaching nearly $349 billion, up 16%. A key factor is the U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement, which reduced tariffs on Vietnamese goods from 46% to 20%, stimulating a 'race to export' before the policy took full effect. In contrast, India has suffered under U.S. tariffs: after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods in August 2024, India\u2019s exports to the U.S. fell sharply, contributing to a record $41.68 billion trade deficit in October 2025. India\u2019s export value dropped 11.8% to $34.38 billion, while gold imports surged 200% to $14.7 billion due to the Diwali festival. India\u2019s 2025\u20132026 fiscal year growth is projected between 6.3% and 6.8% by its finance ministry and central bank. Moody\u2019s warned that the tariffs severely undermine India\u2019s manufacturing ambitions. India has responded with over $5 billion in export relief, diversifying trade to 50 countries and signing a landmark $220 million annual liquefied petroleum gas import deal with the U.S. in November 2025. Despite these efforts, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have downgraded India\u2019s 2026 GDP growth forecast to 6.5%, citing the negative impact of U.S. tariffs.

The strong performance was driven by robust manufacturing and exports, with industrial output rising 9.92% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2025. Vietnam's total trade volume reached $680.6 billion, up 17.3%, with exports growing 16% and imports 18.8%, resulting in a trade surplus of $168.2 billion. A key factor behind the export surge was a U.S.-Vietnam framework agreement that reduced average tariffs on Vietnamese goods from 46% to 20%, prompting a 'race to export' before the new tariffs took effect. In contrast, India faced significant economic headwinds due to U.S. tariffs.

In its November 2025 monthly report, the central bank stated that exports and industrial activity, after a turbulent start to the year marked by a shift from an initial export boom to a burden, are expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter. Services are projected to support economic activity, though not necessarily from consumer-driven sectors, with overall production likely to see a slight increase. Germany recorded stagnation in the third quarter of 2025, continuing a two-year trend of flat growth since 2023. The Bundesbank cited U.S. tariff increases and China\u2019s growing global market share as key challenges. Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz is attempting to stimulate the economy through investments of hundreds of billions in defense and infrastructure, though the Bundesbank notes these projects will only impact construction and investment activity in 2026. The bank also highlighted Germany\u2019s weak competitiveness, which limits its ability to benefit from global growth. Labor market signals remain subdued: private consumption remains weak due to limited household financial flexibility, and manufacturers have significantly reduced staffing. While new hires in sectors benefiting from demographic change and the energy transition provide some relief, the overall trend remains weak. The European Central Bank is closely monitoring wage developments, particularly as new data on collective bargaining in the third quarter will be released on Friday. The Bundesbank noted that nominal wage growth in Germany declined slightly in 2025 compared to the prior year due to a one-time inflation compensation payment in 2024; excluding this, wages still rose by 5%, though at a slower pace than in the previous quarter. The report adds that older collective agreements with higher wage increases are gradually expiring, and due to the weak macroeconomic environment and declining inflation, further contracts are expected to feature lower increases.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan - German](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/de/germany-economy-rebounding-in-q4/)\n\n**Brazil to Become a Global Economic Power by 2026, According to the IMF**\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brazil will become a major global economic power by 2026, rising to eighth place in the world economic ranking and displacing developed economies. Currently ranked ninth, Brazil is projected to have a nominal GDP exceeding $2.1 trillion by 2026, solidifying its position as Latin America's largest economy. The IMF attributes Brazil's ascent to structural factors including commercial openness, diversified global trade networks spanning Asia, Europe, and North America, expansion in strategic sectors such as agribusiness, industry, energy, technology, and mining, and a robust domestic market supported by stability-oriented policies. The 2026 global economic ranking, as projected by the IMF, will include: United States, China, Japan, Germany, India, United Kingdom, France, and Brazil\u2014marking the first time a Latin American country enters this elite group, signaling a significant reconfiguration of global economic influence.

Advanced economies are expected to grow at 1.6% in both 2025 and 2026, while emerging markets and developing economies are projected to grow at 4.2% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026. The United States remains the world\u2019s largest economy with a projected GDP of $30.62 trillion in 2025 and a growth rate of 2.0%, while China is the second-largest at $19.4 trillion and 4.8% growth. India ranks fifth globally with a projected GDP of $4.13 trillion in 2025 and a growth rate of 6.6%, making it the fastest-growing major economy. India is expected to surpass Germany and become the third-largest economy within 2.5 to 3 years, according to NITI Aayog CEO B V R Subrahmanyam. The country\u2019s GDP per capita is projected at $2.82 thousand in 2025.

The United States is projected to maintain its position as the world\u2019s largest economy with a GDP of $31.8 trillion in 2026, supported by a resilient labor market and consumer spending, though growth estimates were revised downward after October 2024 due to trade wars and inflationary pressures. China is forecast to reach $20.7 trillion in GDP, 35% smaller than the U.S., but three times larger than Germany\u2019s projected $5.3 trillion, which ranks third. Structural challenges such as an aging population and a stagnant housing market are limiting U.S. growth to 4%, the slowest multi-year pace in four decades. India is expected to remain in fourth place at $4.5 trillion, having overtaken Japan in 2025, driven by domestic demand.

This projection, based on the IMF's World Economic Outlook update for October 2025, reflects a $128.1 billion increase from the April 2025 forecast. Turkey's GDP is expected to grow further to $1.5761 trillion in 2026, $1.6409 trillion in 2027, $1.7604 trillion in 2028, $1.8663 trillion in 2029, and $1.9618 trillion in 2030. Despite this upward trajectory, Turkey will remain 16th in 2026 and drop to 17th from 2027 to 2030. The IMF notes that Turkey's GDP ranking fluctuated significantly due to financial crises and currency shocks, notably dropping to 20th in 2020 after a sharp decline in nominal GDP. Although Turkey surpassed the $1 trillion mark in 2023, it remains far from joining the top 10 economies. The IMF does not project Turkey entering the top 10 by 2030. The report also highlights rapid growth in India's economy, which is expected to surpass Japan in 2026 to become the world's fourth-largest economy, and overtake Germany by 2029 to reach third place. Japan is projected to fall to sixth place by 2030, overtaken by the UK, France, Italy, Canada, and Russia. The U.S. is forecast to maintain its top position with a GDP of $30.6 trillion in 2025 and $31.8 trillion by 2030, while China will grow from $18.4 trillion in 2024 to $20.7 trillion by 2030, narrowing the gap with the U.S. but not surpassing it.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 09:30 PM\nSource:[D\u00fcnya](https://www.dunya.com/kose-yazisi/imfye-gore-turkiye-2025te-16-buyuk-ekonomi/798789)\n\n**IMF Predicts India to Surpass Japan's GDP by 2026, Pushing Japan to 5th Place**\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Japan's nominal GDP is projected to be $4.4636 trillion by 2026, dropping from fourth to fifth place globally, as India's GDP is expected to reach $4.5056 trillion and surpass Japan.

By 2030, Japan will be overtaken by the United Kingdom, projected at $5.1997 trillion. India\u2019s sustained high growth is driven by its population exceeding 1.4 billion, strong consumer spending, and corporate investment in domestic infrastructure. The IMF projects India\u2019s real economic growth rate will remain in the 6% range after 2026, with India expected to surpass Germany and rise to third place by 2029.

Nominal GDP is affected by inflation and exchange rates; Takashi Takayama, senior researcher at Nihon Keizai Foundation, noted that Japan\u2019s dollar-denominated GDP has declined by approximately 30% since the COVID-19 pandemic due to a sharp fall in yen value, persistent trade deficits, and a weakening real economy.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 05:22 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/202510162975i)\n\n**Japan's GDP to Fall to World Fifth by 2026, Surpassed by India According to IMF Outlook**\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Japan's nominal GDP is projected to decline from fourth to fifth place globally by 2026, falling to $4.4636 trillion. This shift is primarily driven by a sustained yen depreciation, which reduces the dollar-denominated value of Japan's GDP. In 2024, Japan's nominal GDP stood at $4.019 trillion, ranking fourth behind the U.S., China, and Germany. It had already dropped from third to fourth place in 2023 after being overtaken by Germany.

    "summary": "All expert forecasters\u2014across economic modeling, country risk, macroeconomics, and international political economy\u2014converge on a strong consensus: India is highly unlikely to surpass Germany to become the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy by the end of 2025. Despite India\u2019s robust economic growth, the absolute nominal GDP gap with Germany remains substantial (approximately $800\u2013900 billion as of the latest IMF October 2025 forecasts), and all major projections (IMF, World Bank, reputable financial outlets) expect India to overtake Germany only several years later, often projecting 2028\u20132029 for this milestone. Key factors cited for the low probability include: (1) strong base rate inertia against rapid rank changes among the world\u2019s largest economies, (2) significant negative impact from recent U.S. tariffs on Indian exports, leading to a record trade deficit and slower nominal GDP growth, (3) lack of a dramatic downturn or currency crisis in Germany, with some stabilization and modest rebound expected in late 2025, (4) exchange rate effects that remain too muted to cause a reversal, and (5) structural and external constraints faced by India, per both dependency and convergence theoretical perspectives. All forecasters agree that while India\u2019s medium-term prospects for overtaking Germany are strong, the required jump within the remaining five weeks is implausible without an unprecedented shock or revision, for which there is no current evidence. Final probability estimates for India overtaking Germany in 2025 cluster between 2% and 5%, with the overwhelming likelihood that end-2025 rankings will show Germany still in fourth place and India fifth.",
