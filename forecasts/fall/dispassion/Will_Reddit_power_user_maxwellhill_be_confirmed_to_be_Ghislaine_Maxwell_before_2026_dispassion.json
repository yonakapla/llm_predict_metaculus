The forecast highlights how, even with new document releases and sustained public scrutiny, nothing has emerged that would satisfy the standards required for confirmation by major institutions. This directly supports the observation that the media continues to frame the theory as fringe or conspiratorial, rather than as a credible hypothesis. Their reasoning accurately reflects the institutional inertia and legal caution that media gatekeepers rely on, reinforcing the assessment that the probability of confirmation is extremely low."

From a Media Studies (Meme Theory) perspective, a meme's persistence on the internet\u2014even in the absence of new evidence\u2014can occasionally force reluctant engagement from institutions or prompt investigative curiosity that otherwise would not arise. While these are low-probability tail events, their possibility adds nuance beyond the simple status quo. The forecast would be stronger by acknowledging that, although unlikely, the virality and cultural stickiness of this meme means that sudden, unexpected developments (such as a leak, a confession, or a digital forensics breakthrough) are not strictly impossible, even late in the meme's lifecycle. This doesn't substantially raise the probability, but it means total closure is not as absolute as the forecast suggests."

The original question opened on 2021-05-14 07:00:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7082). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nIn 2020, people posted on 4chan, Twitter and then Reddit a theory that the Reddit account [maxwellhill](https://www.reddit.com/user/maxwellhill) belongs to Ghislaine Maxwell, who at the time of writing has been charged with enticement of minors and sex trafficking of underage girls. \n\nu/maxwellhill was the first account to receive 1 million \"karma\" (points) on Reddit, and at the time the conspiracy theory aired was in the top 10 accounts for karma received. The account is a moderator for a large number of subs (forums), and was for 14 years a regular poster on Reddit.\n\nThe conspiracy relies on circumstantial evidence: \n\n* Maxwell's surname appears in the Reddit username\n* maxwellhill, a prolific poster, has posting gaps at times when Maxwell is known or suspected to have been otherwise engaged\n* maxwellhill says their birthday is in December, and after the 21st of December, which matches Maxwell's 25 December birthday. \n* Most significantly, maxwellhill has not posted publicly since 1 July 2020. Maxwell was arrested on 2 July 2020. \n\nHowever, media sources have been critical of the theory and another Reddit moderator has reportedly received private messages from maxwellhill [after Maxwell's arrest](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3zbaj/incoherent-conspiracy-suggests-ghislaine-maxwell-is-a-powerful-redditor).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":7082,\"question_id\":7082}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This theory will be considered confirmed if it is stated by Ghislaine Maxwell or her representatives, or reported by police, prosecutors or reliable witnesses that Maxwell either is maxwellhill specifically or that she was an active and influential Reddit user (or words to that effect). \n\nThere could also be an accumulation of evidence over time. If respectable news organisations like the New York Times, Washington Post, Guardian or Sydney Morning Herald report that Maxwell is or is likely to be maxwellhill, that will also suffice",

Prosecutors allege that from 2009 to 2019, Powers recruited high-end escorts and former Playboy models to Rubin\u2019s Manhattan penthouse, which was allegedly converted into a soundproofed, red-painted sex dungeon equipped with BDSM apparatus. She is accused of deceiving victims about the nature of the encounters, facilitating drugging, physical abuse, and forced non-disclosure agreements. Rubin allegedly paid victims between $2,000 and $5,000 per session and subjected them to beatings, bondage, and electrocution. Powers allegedly participated in arranging sessions and sent graphic text messages, including one where she wrote, 'I can only imagine what you did to her on that cross!!! Did you shock her p***y??' Rubin, who pleaded not guilty, faces 10 criminal counts including sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution, and bank fraud. Powers is accused of sex trafficking and could face a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted. She is expected to be arraigned in New York on Wednesday, October 1, 2025. Rubin was arrested at his Connecticut home and is scheduled to appear in Brooklyn court on September 26, 2025.

He was apprehended alongside Mat\u00edas Ozorio, a 28-year-old Argentine believed to be his accomplice and linked to drug trafficking. The bodies of three women\u201420-year-olds Morena Verdi and Brenda del Castillo, and 15-year-old Lara Guti\u00e9rrez\u2014were found buried in Florencio Varela, a suburb of Buenos Aires, after they disappeared on September 19, 2025. The crime was livestreamed to a private group of 45 people on social media, reportedly as a warning from a drug trafficking leader over a suspected drug theft. According to Argentine authorities, the suspects are charged with 'qualified homicide by premeditated conspiracy of two or more people, with cruelty, treachery, and gender-based violence, repeated three times, involving three women, including a minor.' Valverde, who has no criminal record in Peru, is alleged to have been involved in 'hitman activities' and 'micro-distribution of cocaine' for two years and lost his father in 2018. The Peruvian National Police, led by General Zenon Loayza D\u00edaz, stated that intelligence operations were key to locating the suspects, with Valverde having entered Peru from Bolivia and being captured in Chilca, 75 km south of Lima, inside a fish transport truck. Valverde will be extradited to Argentina, while Ozorio will be expelled 'as soon as possible,' according to the general. Argentina's Minister of Security, Patricia Bullrich, praised the Peruvian police for their collaboration in the arrest.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 08:52 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/10/01/pequeno-j-suposto-mentor-de-triplo-feminicidio-na-argentina-e-preso-no-peru.ghtml)\n\n**SCOTUS mulling whether to entertain Ghislaine Maxwell's bid for freedom - Conservative Journal Review**\nGhislaine Maxwell, convicted of federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges related to her role in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking ring, has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and shorten her prison sentence. Her legal team argues that a 2007 plea deal between Epstein and Florida prosecutors\u2014where Epstein admitted to state prostitution charges\u2014should have shielded her from federal prosecution in New York, asserting that the government must honor its promises in plea agreements. However, the Justice Department counters that the plea deal was limited to the Southern District of Florida and did not extend to New York, where Maxwell was prosecuted under federal jurisdiction. The agreement was signed by officials from the Florida U.S. Attorney\u2019s office and was not binding nationally. Maxwell filed her appeal on April 10, 2025, and the Supreme Court began reviewing her petition on September 29, 2025, during its 'long conference.' Historically, fewer than 1% of petitions are granted a hearing, with only five to 15 cases accepted annually since 2015, making her chances extremely slim. If the Court declines to hear her case, her attorney, David Oscar Markus, plans to pursue further legal challenges. Markus also suggested Maxwell might testify before Congress if granted clemency, and expressed hope that former President Donald Trump could issue a pardon. Trump acknowledged his pardon power on July 28, 2025, but stated discussing it was 'inappropriate,' emphasizing that justice should not be politicized.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:16 AM\nSource:[conservativejournalreview.com](https://conservativejournalreview.com/ghislaine-maxwell-launches-scotus-bid-for-freedom/)\n\n**Ex-teacher in Orange County arrested in underage online sting**\nMichael Cadilli, a former teacher at Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, California, was arrested in an online sting operation targeting men attempting to meet underage girls. Charged with soliciting a minor, Cadilli allegedly engaged in sexually explicit text messages and attempted to get a kiss from a decoy he believed to be a 15-year-old girl. Evidence includes photos Cadilli sent, some deemed too graphic for broadcast, and messages where he reportedly offered to take the teen shopping, suggested being in the dressing room with her, and asked her to watch him undress. The sting was conducted by 'Big Bad Wolf,' the operator of the online citizen group 'Caught-Fished,' which poses as minors to lure adults seeking sexual contact with minors and then provides evidence to law enforcement. Signal Hill Police made the arrest. Pacifica High School confirmed Cadilli has not worked at the school since 2021 and has not been in a classroom since 2019. Since the arrest, former students have begun sharing their own experiences with him online, and 'Big Bad Wolf' stated, 'I guarantee you a lot of other kids are gonna come forward once they see him online,' noting that many have already come forward. Bail was set at $25,000, and Cadilli's next court hearing is scheduled for October 7, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 02:56 AM\nSource:[FOX 11 Los Angeles](https://www.foxla.com/news/ex-teacher-orange-county-arrested-underage-online-sting)\n\n**Did D4vd act alone, or was his manager involved? Viral post sparks suspicion over new theory**\nThe investigation into the murder of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas, whose decomposed body was found in a Tesla linked to award-winning artist David Antony Burke, known as D4vd, has taken a new turn with a viral Reddit post titled 'd4vd didn't act alone.' The post suggests that D4vd's manager may have been involved in the crime, citing that the Tesla was parked just one minute away from where the manager was allegedly staying. This proximity has fueled speculation about the manager's knowledge, timing, and potential role in covering up or orchestrating the events. Online investigators and Reddit users point to D4vd's digital footprint\u2014including music videos, lyrics, Discord activity, and social media posts\u2014as evidence of obsession and possible guilt. The theory argues that D4vd, due to his age (15 at the time), homeschooling, and impulsive behavior, lacked the capacity to commit such a crime independently, making the manager a likely figure of control or influence. One Reddit user stated, 'If he were D4VD's manager, he would be freaking tf out if he saw a 14-year-old girl around. Who knows what she saw or heard?' Another theorized that D4vd may have been blackmailing the manager over drug-related activities, suggesting the manager had prior knowledge. While some users acknowledge the possibility of confirmation bias and timeline inconsistencies, the theory has gained traction, with one user noting, 'It's just a hectic but stupid way to leave the body\u2014it combines both sophistication with lack of sophistication.' The post went viral on social media, sparking widespread debate about the manager's potential involvement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 05:16 PM\nSource:[IndiaTimes](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/did-d4vd-act-alone-or-was-his-manager-involved-viral-post-sparks-suspicion-over-new-theory-672062.html)\n\n**Ankle monitor disgrace for Texas mom, 45, accused of sick sex crime**\nJennifer Powers, 45, a former personal assistant to Manhattan financier Howard Rubin, 70, appeared in court in Fort Worth, Texas, wearing an ankle monitor after being charged in a 13-page indictment related to a decade-long sex trafficking scheme.

Lara Guti\u00e9rrez had five fingers and one ear amputated; Brenda del Castillo suffered a skull fracture and abdominal incision; Morena Verri died from asphyxiation with a plastic bag over her head. The alleged mastermind, Tony Valverde, was apprehended in the back of a lorry during a road blockade by protesting fishermen on the Pan-American Highway near Lima. His alleged right-hand man, Matias Agustin Ozorio, was arrested earlier in Lima. Argentine Minister of National Security Patricia Bullrich praised Peruvian police for their cooperation, stating, 'You reap what you sow.' The case has been described as 'the most sordid and horrifying' by Buenos Aires prosecutors. Two suspects have been extradited to Argentina, and more than half a dozen others are in custody, including two women arrested cleaning the 'House of Horrors' with bleach. Valverde denied involvement, stating, 'I haven't killed anyone. The guilty person has to be found.' Interpol and Peruvian anti-drug authorities confirmed a coordinated operation involving the Anti-Drug Directorate and Interpol Argentina. The motive, according to officials, was to send a message: 'This is what happens to anyone who steals drugs from me.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 09:35 AM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15151289/narco-torture-mastermind-captured-ordering-live-streamed-murder.html)\n\n**'Pequeno J': Supposed mentor of triple femicide in Argentina arrested in Peru**\nTony Janzen Valverde, a 20-year-old Peruvian known as 'Pequeno J', was arrested on October 1, 2025, in Peru and is suspected of being the mastermind behind a triple femicide in Argentina that shocked the public. He was apprehended alongside Mat\u00edas Ozorio, a 28-year-old Argentine believed to be his accomplice and linked to drug trafficking. The bodies of three women\u201420-year-olds Morena Verdi and Brenda del Castillo, and 15-year-old Lara Guti\u00e9rrez\u2014were found buried in Florencio Varela, a suburb of Buenos Aires, after they disappeared on September 19, 2025. The crime was livestreamed to a private group of 45 people on social media, reportedly as a warning from a drug trafficking leader over a suspected drug theft. According to Argentine authorities, the suspects are charged with 'qualified homicide by premeditated conspiracy of two or more people, with cruelty, treachery, and gender-based violence, repeated three times, involving three women, including a minor.' Valverde, who has no criminal record in Peru, is alleged to have been involved in 'hitman activities' and 'micro-distribution of cocaine' for two years and lost his father in 2018. The Peruvian National Police, led by General Zenon Loayza D\u00edaz, stated that intelligence operations were key to locating the suspects, with Valverde having entered Peru from Bolivia and being captured in Chilca, 75 km south of Lima, inside a fish transport truck. Valverde will be extradited to Argentina, while Ozorio will be expelled 'as soon as possible,' according to the general. Argentina's Minister of Security, Patricia Bullrich, praised the Peruvian police for their collaboration in the arrest.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 08:52 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/10/01/pequeno-j-suposto-mentor-de-triplo-feminicidio-na-argentina-e-preso-no-peru.ghtml)\n\n**Instagram Glamour vs. Arrest Reality: The Shocking Contrast of Alleged Beauty Guru So-go Fujii**\nOn September 30, 2024, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department arrested 33-year-old hair stylist So-go Fujii on suspicion of non-consensual sexual assault, following allegations that he committed lewd acts on a female client at his beauty salon, ELTE, in Omotesando, Tokyo. The incident reportedly occurred around 9:30 p.m. in late April, during which Fujii allegedly lured a 20-something female client into a restroom, locked the door, and forced her to touch his genitalia through her clothing, claiming he would give her a free shampoo and waive the fee. The victim reported the incident in May, prompting the police investigation. The police have not confirmed Fujii\u2019s stance on the charges, but additional complaints from other female clients have been received, and the investigation is ongoing. Fujii, a popular Instagram influencer with 15,000 followers, promoted his services through posts highlighting his skills in non-bleach coloring and sculpted necklines, frequently sharing stylized photos of clients. His Instagram profile featured a polished image: a man with wavy blonde hair, a center part, sharp features, and a refined look resembling a celebrity. However, footage of his arrest showed a stark contrast\u2014his hair was messy, unstyled, and he appeared in plain clothes with minimal makeup, revealing a natural, unedited 'no-makeup' face. This dramatic difference between his curated online image and his actual appearance sparked widespread shock and disbelief online, with many commenters noting the 'huge gap' between his Instagram persona and the arrest footage. The article suggests that Fujii likely used photo editing and makeup to enhance his image, particularly in a competitive area like Omotesando, where he built his clientele through social media. Despite his popularity, including appearances by celebrities and hosting seminars, the allegations, if proven true, could severely damage his reputation and career.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 07:34 AM\nSource:[WEB\u5973\u6027\u81ea\u8eab](https://jisin.jp/domestic/2521442/)\n\n**Beatrice, Eugenie's gross Epstein nickname**\nThe article reveals that Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice referred to Jeffrey Epstein as 'nice Jeffrey' during their childhood, according to reports from the Daily Mail. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was a frequent guest in the York family's private life, with flight logs confirming that he met Princess Sarah Ferguson and the two young princesses in Nassau, Bahamas, on April 16, 1998, when they were eight and nine years old. Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were regularly invited to royal events, including stays at Balmoral, attendance at Prince Andrew\u2019s 40th birthday party at Windsor Castle, and a shooting weekend hosted by Andrew in December 2000. In March 2001, Virginia Giuffre alleged that Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her during a visit to London, with Epstein present; Andrew has denied all allegations. Epstein was arrested in July 2006, the same month Beatrice turned 18 and hosted a grand birthday ball at Windsor Castle that included Epstein, Maxwell, and Harvey Weinstein on the guest list. The article highlights growing scrutiny of the princesses\u2019 associations with their parents\u2019 controversial ties to Epstein and Maxwell, including Beatrice being removed from her role as a trustee of Outward Bound, though the organization stated her contributions were 'greatly valued.' Despite having no personal wrongdoing, the princesses face reputational risks due to their parents\u2019 connections, with questions about their future roles in royal duties and public life. A royal source noted that the revelations about their mother\u2019s closeness to Epstein may severely damage the trust between the daughters and their parents. The article concludes with a pointed question about whether the princesses will choose to spend Christmas 2025 at the Yorks\u2019 Royal Lodge or at Sandringham, symbolizing a potential rift in their royal affiliations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 04:45 AM\nSource:[News.com.au](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/princess-beatrice-and-eugenies-gross-epstein-nickname/news-story/76857e7a6c72d1304a92d49dd4524df3)\n\n**Captured 'Peque\u00f1o J,' Suspected Mastermind of Argentina's Triple Femicide, in Peru Alongside Accomplice**\nTony Janzen Valverde, known as 'Peque\u00f1o J', a 20-year-old Peruvian national and suspected mastermind of a triple femicide in Argentina, was arrested on October 1, 2025, in Lima, Peru, alongside his alleged second-in-command, Mat\u00edas Ozorio, a 28-year-old Argentine citizen.

Her legal team argues that a 2007 plea deal between Epstein and Florida prosecutors\u2014where Epstein admitted to state prostitution charges\u2014should have shielded her from federal prosecution in New York, asserting that the government must honor its promises in plea agreements. However, the Justice Department counters that the plea deal was limited to the Southern District of Florida and did not extend to New York, where Maxwell was prosecuted under federal jurisdiction. The agreement was signed by officials from the Florida U.S. Attorney\u2019s office and was not binding nationally. Maxwell filed her appeal on April 10, 2025, and the Supreme Court began reviewing her petition on September 29, 2025, during its 'long conference.' Historically, fewer than 1% of petitions are granted a hearing, with only five to 15 cases accepted annually since 2015, making her chances extremely slim. If the Court declines to hear her case, her attorney, David Oscar Markus, plans to pursue further legal challenges. Markus also suggested Maxwell might testify before Congress if granted clemency, and expressed hope that former President Donald Trump could issue a pardon. Trump acknowledged his pardon power on July 28, 2025, but stated discussing it was 'inappropriate,' emphasizing that justice should not be politicized.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:16 AM\nSource:[conservativejournalreview.com](https://conservativejournalreview.com/ghislaine-maxwell-launches-scotus-bid-for-freedom/)\n\n**Ex-teacher in Orange County arrested in underage online sting**\nMichael Cadilli, a former teacher at Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, California, was arrested in an online sting operation targeting men attempting to meet underage girls. Charged with soliciting a minor, Cadilli allegedly engaged in sexually explicit text messages and attempted to get a kiss from a decoy he believed to be a 15-year-old girl. Evidence includes photos Cadilli sent, some deemed too graphic for broadcast, and messages where he reportedly offered to take the teen shopping, suggested being in the dressing room with her, and asked her to watch him undress. The sting was conducted by 'Big Bad Wolf,' the operator of the online citizen group 'Caught-Fished,' which poses as minors to lure adults seeking sexual contact with minors and then provides evidence to law enforcement. Signal Hill Police made the arrest. Pacifica High School confirmed Cadilli has not worked at the school since 2021 and has not been in a classroom since 2019. Since the arrest, former students have begun sharing their own experiences with him online, and 'Big Bad Wolf' stated, 'I guarantee you a lot of other kids are gonna come forward once they see him online,' noting that many have already come forward.

The woman noted that Victoria had previously shown excessive attention to her boyfriend, including manipulating group assignments and expressing admiration for him, even stepping down from a main role in a play to be in a minor one with a romantic subplot involving her boyfriend. During the afterparty, Victoria, who was slightly drunk, approached her boyfriend and told him he was a good kisser, suggesting he must have felt a spark. The woman responded by snapping and calling Victoria 'desperate' and 'pathetic,' stating that a stage kiss does not justify pursuing someone else\u2019s partner. Victoria left crying, and her friends have since labeled the woman a 'jerk.' The woman now feels guilty, questioning whether she was wrong to confront Victoria, who she acknowledges is insecure. The story was posted on TwistedSifter on October 1, 2025, and sparked debate on Reddit, with many users supporting her actions, arguing that Victoria had crossed a line by flirting with a committed partner and that confronting her was necessary to stop further escalation.

Viral post sparks suspicion over new theory**\nThe investigation into the murder of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas, whose decomposed body was found in a Tesla linked to award-winning artist David Antony Burke, known as D4vd, has taken a new turn with a viral Reddit post titled 'd4vd didn't act alone.' The post suggests that D4vd's manager may have been involved in the crime, citing that the Tesla was parked just one minute away from where the manager was allegedly staying. This proximity has fueled speculation about the manager's knowledge, timing, and potential role in covering up or orchestrating the events. Online investigators and Reddit users point to D4vd's digital footprint\u2014including music videos, lyrics, Discord activity, and social media posts\u2014as evidence of obsession and possible guilt. The theory argues that D4vd, due to his age (15 at the time), homeschooling, and impulsive behavior, lacked the capacity to commit such a crime independently, making the manager a likely figure of control or influence. One Reddit user stated, 'If he were D4VD's manager, he would be freaking tf out if he saw a 14-year-old girl around. Who knows what she saw or heard?' Another theorized that D4vd may have been blackmailing the manager over drug-related activities, suggesting the manager had prior knowledge. While some users acknowledge the possibility of confirmation bias and timeline inconsistencies, the theory has gained traction, with one user noting, 'It's just a hectic but stupid way to leave the body\u2014it combines both sophistication with lack of sophistication.'

The documents concern former businessman Jeffrey\u202fEpstein, who was charged with sexual crimes and the exploitation of minors. The committee posted the entire batch online as a single unstructured file. The action comes amid accusations that the Trump administration has been opaque about the case, especially after the DOJ released on Friday an interrogation of Ghislaine\u202fMaxwell, Epstein\u2019s former partner, in which she said she had never seen Trump behave inappropriately, stating she had never seen him behave inappropriately ('\u0623\u0628\u062f\u0627'). Maxwell, a well\u2011known socialite, received a 20\u2011year prison sentence after pleading guilty to recruiting underage girls for Epstein, who committed suicide in a New\u202fYork prison in 2019 while awaiting trial. Trump had promised to disclose new developments, but a July\u202f2025 DOJ statement said no new evidence had emerged. Trump has intensified efforts to quell the controversy that has reached his campaign base.

She added that she had introduced Epstein to women but not to underage women, that she had looked for masseuses and did not check their credentials, and that there was no list of clients.

In the transcript Maxwell said she had never seen President Donald Trump in an inappropriate setting and that he was never inappropriate with anyone. She recalled first meeting Trump in 1990 when her father, Roberto Maxwell, owned the New\u202fYork\u202fDaily\u202fNews and was a friend of the former president; she added that her father also liked Ivana Trump. Maxwell described Trump as \"always very cordial and very kind\" and praised his achievement of becoming president. She also stated she did not believe Epstein had taken his own life while in prison. Maxwell was convicted in June\u202f2022 to 20\u202fyears for five sex\u2011trafficking charges and has asked the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction.

Maxwell's lawyer, David Markus, stated that during her second questioning with US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, she answered all questions about approximately 100 individuals. US President Donald Trump stated that he has the power to pardon Maxwell, but has not yet considered it. Trump previously expressed his support for Maxwell during her first trial in New York, saying 'I wish her all the best.' Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 and is currently serving her sentence in a federal prison in Tallahassee. Trump also stated that he never visited Epstein's island. Epstein was charged in the US in 2019 with sex trafficking of minors, which carries a maximum sentence of 40 years, and conspiracy to entice minors into sex trafficking (up to five years). According to prosecutors, between 2002 and 2005, Epstein engaged in sexual relationships with dozens of underage girls at his residences in New York and Florida, paying them hundreds of dollars in cash and instructing some victims to serve as recruiters to bring in new girls. Some victims were as young as 14.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 26, 2025 01:17 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250726/epshteyn-2031555810.html)\n\n**White House Suspects Ghislaine Maxwell Leaked Trump's Birthday Card to Jeffrey Epstein**\nThe White House suspects that Ghislaine Maxwell leaked a birthday card sent by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, her former boyfriend, after it was sent by the US President. The information was published by The Daily Mirror on Friday (25). Epstein was accused of committing at least 250 abuses of underage girls. He was arrested in 2019, but took his own life in prison a month later. High-ranking officials of Trump fear that Maxwell's allies - currently serving 20 years in prison for sex trafficking - may have leaked the card as a 'warning' to the US President about what she knows. There is concern that, if she is not released as per her 2007 plea deal, she may reveal more about Trump's alleged connections to Epstein. In 2022, a New York court sentenced Maxwell to 20 years in prison for conspiring with Epstein to sexually exploit minors. In 2019, American prosecutors accused Epstein of child trafficking for sexual exploitation - a crime that can lead to up to 40 years in prison - and conspiracy to traffic, with a maximum penalty of five years. Trump has denied any involvement in Epstein's activities, but his close relationship with the billionaire in the 1990s and 2000s remains a contentious issue in his history. 'There is no doubt in some minds in the West Wing that the leak came from someone in Maxwell's circle and was not accidental. They believe it was a calculated move, a message to the President that she has not forgotten what she knows and is willing to speak if she is cornered,' said a White House source, according to the report. Concerns about Maxwell revealing more damaging information led the Trump administration to question her this week, before her testimony to Congress. 'That's why we acted quickly to question her before Congress called her for a hearing and everything got out of our control,' added the source. On Friday, the US Deputy Attorney General, Todd Blanche, and other high-ranking officials of the Department of Justice began the second day of questioning with Maxwell in the federal court in Tallahassee, Florida. Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, James Comer, announced on Wednesday that he had summoned Maxwell for a hearing scheduled for August 11 at the Tallahassee Federal Correctional Institution. On the same day, Congressman Scott Perry stated that Maxwell would testify before the committee in the coming weeks. Between the locations where Epstein's abuses occurred was his private island in the Caribbean, as well as mansions in New York, Florida, and New Mexico. Several victims reported being coerced to maintain relationships not only with Epstein but also with influential people in his circle. Despite Trump's denial of any involvement, his past connection to Epstein remains a contentious issue in his history. The case remains a shadow over the relationships between powerful elites and unresolved sex crimes. Maxwell's ally Epstein did not ask for forgiveness, but would accept any relief, says lawyer Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted of association with the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, did not request forgiveness during her recent interrogations with high-ranking officials of the Department of Justice, but would accept any form of relief, said her lawyer David Oscar Markus on Friday. 'We did not ask for anything. This is not a situation where we are asking for something in exchange for testimony or something like that,' Markus told reporters at the end of the second consecutive day of interrogations. 'She is in very difficult conditions for five years and would accept any relief.' Markus noted that during the interrogations on Thursday and Friday, Department of Justice officials questioned Maxwell about approximately 100 individuals linked to the Epstein case, and she responded to all questions. The lawyer also stated that Maxwell has not yet decided whether she will participate in the hearing before the House Oversight Committee, scheduled for August 11 at the Tallahassee Federal Correctional Institution. Earlier on Friday, US President Donald Trump commented that he is 'authorized' to pardon Maxwell, but later suggested that it was not the right time to discuss the issue (with Sputnik).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 10:42 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/mundo/casa-branca-suspeita-que-maxwell-vazou-o-suposto-cartao-de-aniversario-de-trump-para-epstein)\n\n**House panel votes to subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell over Epstein files**\nThe House Oversight Committee voted to subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell, the onetime girlfriend of pedophile and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, to testify before the committee. The move comes as the issue of whether a 'client list' of Epstein's co-conspirators exists continues to consume Washington and much of American political discourse. A bipartisan cohort of lawmakers is threatening to take it a step further by forcing a vote on a resolution directing the Justice Department to release the entirety of its evidence on the Epstein and Maxwell cases. Maxwell remains incarcerated on a 20-year sentence following her conviction for sex trafficking of a minor and other charges. As Epstein's lead accomplice, she's thought to know more about the inner workings of his social circles than anyone besides Epstein himself. The alleged ties between a dead pedophile and powerful figures and institutions in American society are now under the microscope as Americans of all political stripes question whether the federal government is engaged in a cover-up to protect them. The relationship between Epstein and President Donald Trump is central to those questions, as the president was a known friend of Epstein for years. Trump has denied the authenticity of a birthday note allegedly authored by him for Epstein's 50th birthday celebration in 2003, and has filed a $10 million libel suit against the Wall Street Journal. Epstein's efforts to cultivate powerful relationships went far beyond Trump, who at the time was a real estate mogul in New York. The billionaire financier held an office at Harvard University and was connected to other U.S. intellectual and political figures, including former President Bill Clinton. Britain's Prince Andrew was also engulfed in scandal over his own friendship with Epstein. A top Justice Department official, deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, has tried to stifle some of the speculation about a supposed Justice Department cover-up, but his statement has only accelerated the backlash. As one Twitter user noted, 'It's clear that the Justice Department is trying to cover up the truth about Epstein's co-conspirators.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 05:36 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/house-panel-votes-subpoena-ghislaine-143440997.html)\n\n**Trump's Letter to Epstein: A Controversy Erupts**\nA letter with the name of US President Donald Trump and a contour of a naked woman was found among the letters given to Jeffrey Epstein on his 50th birthday in 2003. The letter, which included a drawing of a naked woman and the phrase 'Happy birthday! And may every day be another great secret', was given to Epstein as a gift. Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the picture in a statement to WSJ, and threatened to sue the newspaper if they published the story. Trump said, 'I have never drawn. I do not draw women. This is not my language. These are not my words.' In response to the publication, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to 'provide all necessary evidence to the Grand Jury, subject to court approval.' Bondi quickly responded on X, saying she is ready to do so on Friday, but the process of collecting signatures from judges for such a move will likely take much longer. Vice President JD Vance called the story 'a complete and absolute mess' on social media. The letter with Trump's name was included in an album for Epstein's birthday, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's close associate who was convicted of child trafficking through her connections with Epstein. Maxwell collected letters from Trump and dozens of other people for Epstein's 50th birthday. Trump was photographed with Epstein several times in the 1990s and early 2000s and was among those who appeared in Epstein's private jet flight logs. Trump said their friendship ended before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting minors for prostitution. He later said they had not spoken for about 15 years when Epstein was arrested again in 2019. Epstein, a financier who socialized with some politicians and other influential people, was charged with sex trafficking minors in Florida and New York in 2019. He was later found dead in his cell, and medical experts ruled his death a suicide, but the circumstances of the event have sparked a series of conspiracy theories.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: July 18, 2025 05:29 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439](https://ua.korrespondent.net/world/4799941-tramp-prysylav-epshteinu-neprystoine-vitannia-zmi)\n\n**Trump's Letter to Epstein Raises Questions About Their Relationship**\nA letter with the name of US President Donald Trump and a silhouette of a naked woman was found among the gifts given to Jeffrey Epstein on his 50th birthday in 2003. The letter, which included a silhouette of a naked woman and the phrase 'Happy birthday! May every day be another wonderful secret', was reportedly written by Trump. Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the picture in a comment to WSJ, and threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story. He said, 'I have never drawn. I do not draw women. This is not my language. These are not my words.' Trump also instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to provide all relevant evidence to the Grand Jury, pending court approval. Bondi responded on X that she is ready to do so on Friday, although the process of gathering signatures from judges for such a move will likely take much longer.

Vance commented on a social media post by another user, sharing a fragment of the article with the supposed letter from Trump. 'This story is complete and absolute nonsense. Wall Street Journal should be ashamed to publish this. And where is this letter? You'll be surprised that they never showed it to us before publishing it? Does anyone really believe that this looks like Trump?' - Vance wrote on X. In another post, the politician accuses the Wall Street Journal of violating journalistic ethics. 'Doesn't publishing such a letter without notifying the victim of this ordered article... violate any journalistic ethics rule? Will those who accepted all anti-Trump theories without a grain of skepticism before believing this strange story show any skepticism now?' - Vance noted. The Wall Street Journal claims that Trump gave Epstein a lewd drawing with a congratulatory message on his 50th birthday. According to the newspaper, the alleged Trump drawing is in an album compiled by Epstein's friend Ghislaine Maxwell for his 50th birthday. The album allegedly contained poems, photos, and congratulatory messages from businessmen, scientists, Epstein's former girlfriends, and his childhood friends. Trump stated that the leadership and owners of the Wall Street Journal were warned about the potential lawsuit for defamation before publishing the story about the congratulatory letter allegedly sent by him 20 years ago to Epstein's birthday. In 2019, Epstein was charged in the US with sex trafficking of minors for the purpose of their sexual exploitation, which carries up to 40 years in prison, and conspiracy to involve minors in such trafficking (up to five years in prison). According to the indictment, between 2002 and 2005, Epstein had sex with dozens of underage girls at his residences in New York and Florida, paying them hundreds of dollars in cash, and then instructing some of the victims to serve as recruiters to bring in new girls. The age of some of the victims was under 14. In early July 2019, a New York Manhattan court, hearing Epstein, ordered him to be held in custody and not released on bail. At the end of July of the same year, it became known that Epstein was found in his prison cell 'in a semi-unconscious state', after which he died. The investigation showed that he had taken his own life.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 18, 2025 03:22 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250718/ssha-2029840521.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts, spanning fields such as law enforcement OSINT, cybersecurity, legal evidence, digital forensics, criminology, and media studies, assign an extremely low probability (1-2%) that Reddit user 'maxwellhill' will be confirmed as Ghislaine Maxwell before 2026. Across perspectives, the status quo is that there is no credible, official evidence linking Maxwell to the account, and neither media, law enforcement, nor Maxwell\u2019s representatives have supported or substantiated the theory. Factors universally lowering the probability include the high evidentiary threshold for confirmation (requiring confession or reputable authority statement), a lack of investigative momentum or legal incentive for Maxwell or authorities to provide such confirmation, technical and legal barriers to attributing an anonymous account, and the historically low base rate for internet conspiracy theories being officially confirmed. Experts agree that only a dramatic and unexpected event (such as a major leak, a confession, or new compelling digital/forensic evidence) could produce a 'Yes' outcome. Given the short time remaining before the resolution deadline and the lack of recent developments tied to the theory\u2014despite intense legal and media scrutiny of everything else connected to Maxwell\u2014the scenario is nearly certain to resolve 'No.'",
