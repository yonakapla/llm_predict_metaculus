News of exploratory talks (e.g., X and Stripe, Apple and stablecoins) and the clear shift in the US regulatory climate do increase the odds above the historic baseline, especially for X and Tesla, which have a history of crypto adoption and iconoclastic leadership. However, as of mid-October, there is no hard evidence of imminent rollout, and corporate inertia is powerful. The most likely scenario is that companies continue to experiment or announce pilots, but do not fully implement direct crypto checkout for core offerings by year-end.

From a Regulatory Impact Analysis perspective, I appreciate your attention to the fact that the market environment has fundamentally shifted\u2014regulatory clarity, political support, and technical feasibility are now aligned, which can accelerate the adoption curve, at least for the first mover. Furthermore, your probability (35%) is directionally consistent with my own: while still below 50% due to status quo inertia and operational friction, it is meaningfully above historical baselines. You correctly note that even with significant external changes, large organizations are slow to move, but you also capture the unique 2025 context that makes a sudden, catalyzing event plausible, especially from a player like X. Your scenario analysis is credible, and your argument appropriately weighs both the potential for rapid change and the persistent drag of institutional inertia."

USD1 is the first stablecoin to integrate with the Move programming language, the foundational technology of the Aptos network, and is backed by U.S. Treasuries, dollars, and other cash equivalents, according to a Reuters report. The stablecoin is set to launch on Monday, October 6, 2025, with immediate integration planned across major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols including Echelon Market, Hyperion, Thala Labs, and Panora Exchange. It will also be supported by prominent wallets and exchanges such as Petra Wallet, Backpack, OKX, Bitget Wallet, and Gate.io, ensuring broad accessibility for individual and institutional users. The Aptos network, originally derived from Meta\u2019s discontinued Libra project, currently holds over $720 million in real-world assets (RWAs) and more than $1 billion in stablecoins, including USDC, USDT, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. The network is noted for its low latency and sub-second transaction speeds with average fees of $0.00055. The project is led by World Liberty Financial, which has drawn attention due to its connection to the Trump family and the controversial launch of its native token, WLFI\u2014subject to scam allegations by Elon Musk and sharp price volatility. Despite this, WLFI later secured a listing on Robinhood and underwent multiple token burn events. The USD1 launch on Aptos marks a strategic move toward legitimacy and broader adoption in the competitive digital asset market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 09:41 AM\nSource:[Coinspeaker](https://www.coinspeaker.com/donald-trump-jr-backs-usd1-stablecoin-launch-on-aptos-blockchain/)\n\n**Donald Trump Jr. Backs USD1 Stablecoin Launch on Aptos Blockchain**\nWorld Liberty Financial, the crypto project co-founded by Donald Trump Jr., has launched its USD1 stablecoin on the Aptos blockchain, marking a significant milestone as the first stablecoin with a Move-based integration.

Bitcoin (BTC) traded near $112,900 (+0.7%), maintaining a 58.1% market dominance, with investor sentiment neutral (43%). Despite growing concerns over a potential U.S. government shutdown on Wednesday, October 1\u2014the first day of the fiscal year\u2014due to a deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over President Donald Trump\u2019s budget, Bitcoin remained correlated with major stock indices: the S&P 500 closed at 6,661.21 (+0.26%) and Nasdaq at 22,591.55 (+0.48%). Market volatility risks include the government shutdown, along with key U.S. economic reports such as Jolts, ADP, PMI, and ISM. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose to 16.51 (+2.4%), indicating heightened fear. Despite this, U.S.-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw net inflows of $521.95 million and $546.96 million, respectively, according to SoSoValue.

The article notes that in late 2024 Bitcoin reached a new all\u2011time high of $107,000 per unit after President Donald Trump reiterated plans to create a strategic reserve of the digital asset in the United States. Earlier, in March 2024, Bitcoin had set a record near $73,000 amid a surge of institutional investment and growing confidence in blockchain technology. The piece highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization places it at the top of the most popular digital currencies. It also discusses factors driving the price rise, including institutional adoption, economic uncertainty prompting alternative investments, and continuous blockchain innovation, as reported by Bloomberg. The article cautions that while Bitcoin\u2019s value can rise quickly, it also carries high risk, with potential for sudden crashes that could wipe out investors\u2019 savings. It explains that users store Bitcoin in digital wallets that hold private keys, which must be protected to secure ownership. The article references influential figures such as Elon Musk, who has promoted Bitcoin, and notes that after the launch of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI model, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell in most equity markets.

USD1 is the first stablecoin to integrate with the Move programming language, the foundational technology of the Aptos network, and is backed by U.S. Treasuries, dollars, and other cash equivalents, according to a Reuters report. The stablecoin is set to launch on Monday, October 6, 2025, with immediate integration planned across major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols including Echelon Market, Hyperion, Thala Labs, and Panora Exchange. It will also be supported by prominent wallets and exchanges such as Petra Wallet, Backpack, OKX, Bitget Wallet, and Gate.io, ensuring broad accessibility for individual and institutional users.

Paul Atkins, SEC chair, stated at a round\u2011table with the CFTC that \"Cripto es la prioridad n\u00famero uno en este momento\" and that the two agencies must work in \"perfect sync\" to build a friction\u2011free framework. Interim CFTC chair Caroline Pham added \"es un nuevo d\u00eda, pues la guerra de territorios ha terminado,\" signalling a move toward cooperation. The discussion highlighted prediction markets, perpetual futures, and 24/7 trading as key areas for joint regulation. While the SEC oversees equities and bonds, the CFTC regulates derivatives; the 2024 Crypto Clarity Act is expected to clarify jurisdiction, giving the CFTC more authority over non\u2011securities crypto such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Pham also noted the potential to design a market structure that improves liquidity, capital efficiency, volume, and flow. Hester Peirce, SEC commissioner, expressed openness to dialogue on tokenization, stressing the need to understand how tokenized assets interact with traditional counterparts. She urged a nuanced regulatory approach, citing tokenized securities as digital blockchain representations of underlying assets. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach a market cap of about 2\u202ftrillion dollars by 2030. CoinDesk reports that the SEC has asked crypto\u2011ETF issuers to withdraw 19b\u20114 filings; the agency has recently relaxed rules, allowing exchanges to list ETFs based on a generic listing standard, cutting the approval window from up to 240 days to 75 days.

The company, linked to House of Doge, aims to give investors exposure to Dogecoin without direct ownership. Spiro, a partner at Quinn\u202fEmanuel, is slated to become president. The piece recounts Musk\u2019s past influence on Dogecoin: in 2019 he called it his favourite cryptocurrency, a comment that helped lift the token, and in a 2021 Saturday\u202fNight\u202fLive appearance he described Dogecoin as a 'truffa', a remark that caused a sharp price drop and drew regulatory scrutiny. Musk faced a market\u2011manipulation lawsuit in 2022, which was dismissed in 2024 with Spiro\u2019s defence.

According to Bloomberg, this milestone was reached on July 18. The options market indicates that traders are increasing their bets on further growth in the coming weeks. 'The path to Bitcoin reaching $150,000 looks increasingly inevitable,' said Fadi Aboualfa, research director at Copper. Bitcoin accounts for around 60% of the total cryptocurrency market. The new record was set after the passage of the first federal law on stablecoins, a key achievement in the so-called Crypto Week. The document, supported by Republicans and promoted by Donald Trump, introduces oversight of dollar-pegged tokens and opens up new opportunities for institutional investors. Its goal is to legalize a $265 billion market that, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts, could grow to $3.7 trillion by 2030. Altcoins, all tokens except Bitcoin, have been the driver of the latest rally. Ethereum rose 22% over the past five days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin reached a record $123,205 this week. Uniswap rose 24% on Friday, while Solana rose 6.5%. The House of Representatives also passed a comprehensive bill on the structure of the cryptocurrency market on Thursday, which is now awaiting consideration in the Senate. It is known that the growth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was sparked by Donald Trump's presidential election victory in the US. The Republican candidate publicly expressed his support for digital assets. Against this backdrop, market participants are increasing their bets that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by the end of the year. Dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency, has also grown by nearly 20%.

When asked about Bitcoin adoption on X, Musk replied, 'The fiat currency is hopeless. So, yes.' Musk has a long history of involvement with cryptocurrencies, and Tesla is known for being one of the early adopters of Bitcoin. In 2021, Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and began holding it as a financial reserve. Currently, Tesla holds 11,509 BTC, valued at approximately $126 million. According to Bitbo, this puts Tesla in 9th place among publicly traded companies in terms of Bitcoin holdings. Musk has also been a long-time supporter of Dogecoin (DOGE), a meme-based cryptocurrency. Samson Mow, founder of JAN3, believes that Musk's adoption of Bitcoin will give him an advantage over his rival, former President Trump. Mow suggests that Tesla should again accept Bitcoin payments and implement a discount system for Bitcoin payments on SpaceX. However, Musk has not always been a supporter of Bitcoin. In 2021, he stated that the price of Bitcoin was 'too high', and the price subsequently fell. Musk has also criticized Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill', which he believes will increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years. Musk has also criticized the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) for its efforts to reduce spending, saying that it would only increase the national debt by $5 trillion.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: July 08, 2025 05:59 AM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://jp.cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-confirms-new-america-party-will-embrace-bitcoin)\n\n**Elon Musk's 'America Party' To Accept Bitcoin - Tesla CEO Says 'Fiat Is Hopeless' By Stocktwits**\nElon Musk's newly formed America Party will accept Bitcoin, according to Musk's response on social media platform X.

Over $300 billion has 'disappeared' from the altcoin sector - all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin - in 2025. Despite friendly rhetoric from President Donald Trump, a pending law in Congress, and growing interest from major companies like Amazon, the paradox remains: the main cryptocurrency is strengthening its position, while its 'younger brothers' are losing value, popularity, and trust. According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin's share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has reached 64% - a record high since January 2021. In contrast, the MarketVector index, tracking the 50 weakest altcoins in the top 100, has fallen by more than 50% since Trump's election. Even Ethereum, which has partially recovered due to the launch of spot ETFs, is still trading at half its historic high. However, the cryptocurrency market in 2025 is no longer a field for enthusiasts' experiments. Its format is changing: banks, payment giants, and institutional investors are entering the game. The main contenders for survival are stablecoins, DeFi projects with real income, and possibly Solana - if the CLARITY law is passed and ETFs are approved. Bitcoin is now 'digital gold.' Ethereum is infrastructure. The rest are a matter of time.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 01, 2025 07:19 AM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/economics/2240835-bitcoin-vs-altcoins/)\n\n**Cryptocurrencies Continue to Move Towards Mainstream Market with Trump's Support**\nSince President Trump took office, he has consistently expressed support for virtual currencies. Although Bitcoin's price has fluctuated due to the controversy between Trump and Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been officially included in the S&P 500 index. Among the few domestic ETFs related to virtual currencies, Taishin Digital Payment Service (00909) has the highest weight in Coinbase. On the 9th, 00909 rose by 2.1% to close at 30.51 yuan, maintaining its position above the weekly, monthly, and quarterly lines, with a trading volume of 4,092 shares. Experts say that Trump's support has gradually transformed Bitcoin and stablecoins from 'high-risk investment products' to 'national strategic weapons'. Bitcoin is seen as a symbol of anti-inflation and anti-establishment, while stablecoins are seen as a tool to maintain the dollar's status and promote international digital payment leadership. With the support of Trump, Musk, and other big names, cryptocurrencies are gradually moving towards the mainstream financial market, and related ETFs are also gaining attention. Taishin Digital Payment Service (00909) focuses on the three potential digital payment areas of 'digital payment', 'digital asset software', and 'digital asset infrastructure', tracking the Solactive Global Digital Payment Services Index, which covers cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and related stocks.

The tech giants are considering stablecoins as a way to reduce transaction costs and optimize international payments. Stablecoins are digital tokens tied to fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, offering a bridge between cryptocurrency infrastructure and traditional financial systems. In 2024, they facilitated transactions worth over $276 trillion, surpassing the combined transactions of Visa and Mastercard, according to a World Economic Forum report. Stablecoins are a rapidly growing area of interest for traditional finance, and this trend appears to be significantly intensifying after the impressive IPO of Circle, a stablecoin issuer, on Thursday. According to Fortune, Apple has been in talks with cryptocurrency companies since January, exploring the possibility of integrating stablecoins into Apple Pay and its broader payment infrastructure. Meanwhile, X is discussing with Stripe the possibility of including stablecoin-based transactions. Airbnb is considering stablecoins as a way to reduce the commission it pays to payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. One crypto industry leader told Fortune that the company has been in talks with Worldpay since the start of 2025. Political changes, primarily the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency, have made the adoption of cryptocurrencies less risky in the corporate world of America. Some analysts predict that the stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion by 2028. A key factor supporting this growth is the expected passage of the GENIUS Act, which will provide regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers and potentially stimulate wider adoption of the technology in the United States. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 08, 2025 10:22 AM\nSource:[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/ru/business/2025/06/06/stablecoin-fever-as-circle-soars-apple-x-airbnb-are-reportedly-exploring-stablecoin-integration-to-cut-payment-costs)\n\n**Metaplanet's $5.4 Billion Bitcoin Bet and the Rise of Bitcoin Pepe**\nBitcoin's price plummeted on Thursday amidst a broader market downturn triggered by an unexpected and highly publicized feud between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The dispute, stemming from a series of political jabs and misunderstandings shared on social media and public appearances, caught markets off guard. Cryptocurrency assets were among the hardest hit, as risk aversion sentiment worsened. Bitcoin (BTC), which had shown signs of stabilization at the beginning of the week, fell to a session low of $100,501 - a 6% drop from its highest level in the week, around $106,000. This decline effectively wiped out recent gains and reignited speculation about institutional adoption. As Bitcoin struggles with new volatility, retail investors are turning their attention to high-risk, high-reward assets like Bitcoin Pepe, which is entering its final pre-sale phase. Metaplanet announces a major Bitcoin bet The Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced a massive capital raise of $5.4 billion to increase its stake in Bitcoin, claiming it is the largest capital raise in Asia for Bitcoin acquisition to date. The funding will be secured through the issuance of 555 million shares - equivalent to 92.4% of all Metaplanet shares - via a Japanese version of a strike warrant, a type of capital market instrument. This structure allows the company to gradually sell shares over a two-year period to minimize market disruption. EVO FUND is the allocation, while Evolution Japan Securities serves as the organizer. 'We're thrilled to announce the largest-ever capital raise in Asia for Bitcoin acquisition - again! This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our Bitcoin strategy,' said CEO Simon Gerovich in a post on X. This latest effort, dubbed 'Plan 555 Million,' is a continuation of Metaplanet's previous 'Plan 210 Million' and underscores its transition to a full-fledged Bitcoin operation. The company is now aiming to hold 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025 (up from 10,000), 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 (up from 21,000), and 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027 - targeting a 1% share of the 21 million total Bitcoin supply. To achieve this goal, Metaplanet will utilize a mix of non-equity instruments, including convertible bonds, preferred shares, and common shares, signaling a long-term, diversified approach to accumulating Bitcoins. Bitcoin Pepe gains attention on the market While Bitcoin navigates short-term price fluctuations, its deepening integration with institutional finance is laying the groundwork for renewed dynamics across the market. In this context, investor interest is shifting towards speculative niches, and meme coins are quickly attracting inflows. Among the names gaining popularity is Bitcoin Pepe, which has drawn attention by combining the appeal of memes with the ambitions of blockchain infrastructure. Bitcoin Pepe, touted as one of the most closely watched pre-sales in 2025, stands out with its goal of 'building Solana on Bitcoin,' aiming to combine Bitcoin's robust security with the scalability associated with Solana. Unlike many meme tokens, which rely primarily on hype, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself with a technical roadmap. During the ongoing pre-sale, it has raised over $13.9 million, ahead of its planned listing on June 17. The project has also outlined several partnerships to strengthen its layer 2 ecosystem, collaborating with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. As capital continues to flow towards early-stage projects, Bitcoin Pepe aims to capitalize on this momentum, entering its final token sale phase.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 12:21 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/pl/wiadomosci/2025/06/06/najlepsze-przedsprzedaze-kryptowalut-gdy-metaplanet-planuje-duzy-zakup-bitcoinow/)\n\n**Bitcoin Falls to $100,000 Amid Conflict Between Elon Musk and Donald Trump**\nBitcoin fell to $100,000 on June 6, 2025, due to a conflict between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. The price of BTC dropped to $100,501, but has since recovered to $103,163. Other cryptocurrencies with high market capitalization also fell, with Dogecoin (-7.39%), Ethereum (-5.79%), and Cardano (-5.56%) experiencing the largest declines. The decline in cryptocurrency prices occurred on the backdrop of a conflict between American billionaire Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Musk criticized Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' on his X page, calling it 'a disaster.' Trump expressed disappointment with Musk's statements, saying that he 'has lost his mind' after the president revoked the mandate for electric cars and asked him to leave. Musk also stated that Trump would not have won the US presidential election without him. He then claimed that Trump is involved in the Jeffrey Epstein case and that's why the documents have not been released. California passed a law allowing the state to seize inactive cryptocurrency assets after three years. The law, AB-1052, was passed by the California State Assembly and allows the state to seize cryptocurrency assets that have not been accessed for three years. However, the assets will not be liquidated. According to Eric Peterson, director of policy at the Satoshi Action Fund, 'When your Bitcoin is transferred to the state as unclaimed property from an exchange, it remains in the form of Bitcoin, not sold. You can retrieve it in the form of Bitcoin from the state of California.' Binance has accumulated $31 billion in stablecoins, according to CryptoQuant. The exchange has a 59% market share of the top 20 trading platforms. Binance has led the market in terms of average deposit volume in Bitcoin, indicating interest from large market participants. The exchange has a total reserve of $110 billion, ranking second behind Coinbase's $129 billion.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 08:43 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0444\u0438\u043d](http://minfin.com.ua/ua/2025/06/06/152301546/)\n\n**Trump and Musk's Relationship Ends: What's Next for the Cryptocurrency Market?**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced that he has ended his relationship with Elon Musk and does not think about reconciliation. Trump made this statement during a live ABC News broadcast. Additionally, Trump's company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), has made a surprise move by filing an application for a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF in Nevada through its Truth Social brand. Meanwhile, a Chinese company, Webus International Limited, has announced a plan to create a 300 million dollar XRP reserve, which it will submit to the SEC. The company specializes in artificial intelligence-based mobility solutions. Bitcoin has seen a record-breaking year in 2025, with a significant increase in the number of wallets and transaction volume. Coinbase has introduced new versions of XRP and Dogecoin, which are now available for use in decentralized applications. In a single day, 22,500 BTC was withdrawn from exchanges, resulting in a significant decline in Bitcoin's price. The tension between Trump and Musk has led to a sharp decline in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin's price reaching its lowest level in a month. Institutional interest in cryptocurrency has increased, with a record 5.2 billion dollars in net inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in May. PancakeSwap has seen a record in terms of trading volume and user numbers, with a new token launch and airdrop campaign contributing to its success. The Official Trump token has lost 13% of its value in the past week, with the development team behind the project sending millions of dollars worth of TRUMP tokens to exchanges. Ravencoin has seen a 75% increase in value in the past 24 hours, reaching a new high of 0.02 dollars. The fate of Bitcoin is tied to the Fed's interest rate decision, with the market holding its breath for the announcement on Friday. Elon Musk has criticized the massive tax and spending package proposed by the Republicans, which he believes will increase the US debt. Ripple has unlocked 2.21 billion dollars worth of XRP, which will be released in June. Cardano's ADA token has lost 9% of its value in the past week, but analysts believe that the decline may be temporary. The decreasing supply of Bitcoin may trigger a new price increase. Sygnum Bank's June 2025 Investment Outlook report suggests that the decrease in Bitcoin's supply may be a sign of a strong upward trend.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[cryptopotato.com](https://cryptopotato.com/language/tr/cryptopotato-turkce/)\n\n**Speculation and Risks of Memecoins Like $TRUMP**\nIn January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump introduced his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, just days before beginning his second presidential term, causing a significant impact on the crypto market. The token's price surged from $20 to over $70 per unit within hours of trading, raising the coin\u2019s market capitalization to approximately $14 billion and generating trading volume exceeding $24 billion. $TRUMP was launched on the Solana blockchain, known for its speed and efficiency, and promoted through Trump\u2019s social media platforms, Truth Social and X, leading to rapid adoption among his supporters. Concurrently, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own cryptocurrency, $MELANIA, which, while having a smaller impact, also attracted investor attention. Both tokens were unveiled at the 'Crypto Ball,' a Washington D.C. event held to commemorate the presidential inauguration. Despite the initial enthusiasm, experts warned of the speculative nature of 'memecoins' and their lack of intrinsic value. In response, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the creation of a 'Crypto Task Force' to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, aiming to protect investors and ensure market integrity. The task force will be led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her proactive stance on crypto. Following the SEC\u2019s announcement, $TRUMP\u2019s price partially recovered, stabilizing around $44 per unit, though persistent volatility underscores the need for stronger regulation and investor education.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 18, 2025 04:59 PM\nSource:[panamacrece.com](https://panamacrece.com/especulacion-y-peligros-de-las-memecoins-como-trump/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters across regulatory, corporate payments, economics, strategic management, and crypto industry domains largely agree that, as of mid-October 2025, none of Google, Meta, Amazon, Tesla, or X currently accept crypto (including stablecoins) directly as payment for core products/services in a way that satisfies the strict resolution criteria. Nearly all experts acknowledge a sharply improved US regulatory and political environment in 2025: Trump administration support, new SEC/CFTC harmonization, pro-crypto and stablecoin legislation, and mainstream institutional uptake have removed many longstanding legal and reputational barriers. Several news reports confirm active internal talks and technical explorations at X and Google (and sometimes Amazon) to integrate stablecoins like USDC; Musk\u2019s X is consistently flagged as the most likely first mover. Nevertheless, experts stress multiple factors that depress immediate adoption odds: technical and compliance integration for core checkout systems remains time-consuming and risk-averse within large public companies; historic base rates for such rollouts are extremely low; the time left to year-end (~2.5 months) is very tight, particularly with end-of-year freezes and the need for compliance/UX vetting; and the resolution's fine print (requiring that crypto prices be natively shown at checkout, not via redirect, and for non-experimental core offerings) sets a much higher bar than typical PR announcements or pilots. While the environment is seen as more favorable than ever, and a leap by X (or less likely Tesla, Google, or Amazon) is plausible, the most probable scenario is that such integrations remain in late-stage pilot, compliance review, or limited rollout\u2014failing to meet the criteria by December 31, 2025. The typical probability range assessed is 20-38%, with most clustering in the 22-32% range. Experts uniformly anticipate that, if a company does act, X under Musk is the most credible candidate given his prior crypto enthusiasm and flexibility, but corporate inertia, technical hurdles, and recent public silence weigh against a near-term public launch. In sum, forecasters see much-elevated odds over historical baselines, but believe a qualifying rollout is still less likely than not for 2025.",
