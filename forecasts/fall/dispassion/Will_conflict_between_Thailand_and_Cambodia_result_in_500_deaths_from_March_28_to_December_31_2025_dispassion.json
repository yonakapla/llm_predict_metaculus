While trust remains low and both sides have strong nationalist elements that could provoke renewed violence, the structural incentives for large-scale escalation are weak: military limitations, high international scrutiny, and recent traumatic displacement of large civilian populations all serve as strong brakes on renewed fighting. The escalation ladder model suggests that both sides have reached a 'hurting stalemate' and are now seeking a face-saving exit, with the likelihood of further kinetic exchanges diminishing as diplomatic mechanisms take hold. The death toll would have to increase by more than an order of magnitude compared to the current level to reach 500 by December 31, which would require a catastrophic breakdown of all diplomatic mechanisms and a prolonged, intense military conflict.

Since then, both sides have participated in substantive and ongoing diplomatic processes, including troop withdrawals, prisoner releases, and high-level talks. These are classic de-escalatory moves per ICM frameworks. Reports of psychological operations and sporadic incidents signal lingering mistrust and the potential for renewed violence, but the threshold for 500 deaths is very high: it would require at least one more episode as intense as July's, or a longer period of sustained fighting, neither of which seems likely given the current diplomatic momentum and regional/international attention. The most likely scenario is sporadic incidents, not renewed large-scale combat. There is some risk of accidents or spoilers, but the preponderance of evidence points to a stabilized, if fragile, situation. ICM highlights that after a major escalation, crisis actors are often more risk-averse due to fatigue, displacement, and international scrutiny\u2014further reducing the probability of another mass fatality event this year.",

Track Two analysis reveals that even in the face of mutual distrust and some ongoing psychological operations (e.g., 'ghost sounds'), both sides are currently invested in diplomatic mechanisms and have not allowed escalation to spiral out of control. The presence of scheduled high-level diplomatic events (ASEAN Summit), the resumption of technical border committees, and proven patterns of de-escalation after initial violence all suggest a strong reversion to the mean. A sudden escalation to 500 deaths in the next two months would require a dramatic and historically unprecedented breakdown.

Both sides are now under substantial ASEAN and great power scrutiny, with peace talks progressing and incentives for normalization high. While the trust deficit and nationalist politics mean a sudden relapse is possible, it would require a major, sustained breakdown for deaths to reach 500.

Their forecast could have more explicitly modeled how even in a context of de-escalation, certain rungs on the escalation ladder (such as accidental attacks, leadership crises, or breakdowns in command and control) can lead to brief but intense surges of violence, which\u2014while historically rare\u2014are not impossible.

While diplomatic processes are robust, the ICM approach emphasizes that crises are shaped as much by local triggers, rumor cascades, and affective polarization as by elite-level bargains or agreements. The July\u2013August 2025 violence was triggered despite similar institutional structures being in place. Although a major escalation is unlikely, the liberal analysis should be complemented by greater attention to local dynamics, spoiler risks, and the psychological aftershocks of displacement and loss, which can all fuel renewed violence even in an otherwise cooperative environment."

The recognition that both sides have incentives to de-escalate\u2014due to international scrutiny, domestic costs, and the exhaustion of conflict actors\u2014mirrors what we observe in successful Track Two interventions and backchannel dialogues. Furthermore, the forecaster's explicit acknowledgment of the high threshold (order of magnitude increase) needed for 500 deaths, and the requirement for a catastrophic breakdown of multiple diplomatic mechanisms, shows a sophisticated understanding of both the base rates and escalation dynamics.

The historical record demonstrates that even 'major' flare-ups have remained within the tens of deaths, with both states demonstrating clear thresholds for restraint once international pressure mounts and costs become evident. Furthermore, the operational military limitations and logistical constraints on both sides make a sudden scaling to 500 deaths improbable absent a total collapse of command and control\u2014an extremely rare event in this context. While it is prudent to account for tail risks, the upper bound presented here is not sufficiently anchored in the base rate or in the demonstrated patterns of Thai\u2013Cambodian conflict, where escalation has been sharp but quickly contained.

The ICM approach\u2019s identification of 'fatigue,' displacement, and international visibility as brakes on renewed violence reinforces the liberal argument that cross-border trade, ASEAN engagement, and ongoing negotiations act as robust stabilizers. While local volatility and residual mistrust persist, the ICM reasoning correctly situates these as background risks rather than imminent drivers of mass-casualty escalation, given the current momentum toward normalization.

The forecast accurately notes that the deadliest prior episodes have not come close to the 500-death threshold, and that both sides have significant incentives (external and internal) to avoid the costs of uncontrolled conflict. Furthermore, the assessment of limited operational reach aligns with conflict escalation theory: without the organizational will or capacity for sustained high-intensity warfare, the probability of a sudden surge in deaths is inherently limited.

Realism tends to focus on state-level rationality and structural incentives, but RSCT highlights how local triggers\u2014such as nationalist mobilization, unresolved historical grievances, and the symbolic salience of contested sites\u2014can override cost-benefit calculations in Southeast Asian conflicts. While historically the casualty rate has remained low, the July 2025 fighting escalated quickly and only subsided due to timely external intervention; absent this, the dynamic could have become much deadlier, especially with psychological operations, displacement, and potential third-party involvement. Thus, the Realist position may underestimate the risk posed by regional security complex entanglements, where local events can rapidly spiral despite broader systemic incentives for restraint. While the probability of 500 deaths remains low, dismissing the risk as 'very low' without accounting for these complex, often idiosyncratic, escalation pathways leaves blind spots in the analysis."

The original question opened on 2025-07-26 12:00:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/38938). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe [Thai-Cambodian border dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932013_Cambodian%E2%80%93Thai_border_crisis#Background) is an ongoing conflict centred around the 11th\u2011century Khmer temples of [Preah\u202fVihear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preah_Vihear_Temple) and [Ta\u202fMuen\u202fThom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasat_Ta_Muen_Thom). Cambodia has relied on the [1907 French\u2011produced map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Siamese_treaty_of_1907), while Thailand argues it was never formally accepted, leaving roughly 4.6\u202fkm\u00b2 of overlapping claims. The International Court of Justice [awarded sovereignty](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/45) over Preah\u202fVihear to Cambodia in 1962 and clarified in 2013 that the surrounding promontory also falls under Cambodian control, yet adjacent tracts remain contested. [Border skirmishes in 2008\u201311](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932013_Cambodian%E2%80%93Thai_border_crisis) killed fourty individuals and displaced thousands.\n\nTensions flared again on [28\u202fMay\u202f2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Cambodia%E2%80%93Thailand_border_conflict) when troops exchanged fire near Preah\u202fVihear, escalating over two months into the deadliest clash between the countries in over a decade, with artillery duels, Thai F\u201116 strikes, more than 20 fatalities, the evacuation of more than 130,000 Thai civilians, closure of all crossing points, and an emergency UN Security Council session. On the July 25, Thailand [rejected](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-favours-direct-talks-end-cambodia-conflict-rather-than-mediation-2025-07-25/) mediation offers from The United States, China, and Malaysia, saying that they would like to resolve the dispute bilaterally. In response, Cambodian prime minister Hun Manet [revealed](https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501725013/hun-manet-reaffirms-cambodias-support-for-ceasefire-amid-thai-retraction/) that Cambodia and Thailand had initially agreed on a ceasefire proposed by Malaysian prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, but Thailand retracted from it an hour before it came into effect.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38938,\"question_id\":38278}}`",

Residents in border areas reported hearing piercing, pre-recorded sounds\u2014such as children crying, dogs barking, chains rattling, and helicopter roars\u2014broadcast from loudspeakers at levels causing physical discomfort. The Cambodian Human Rights Commission has appealed to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk, describing the actions as a 'gross violation of human rights' involving 'disturbing sounds used as a form of psychological intimidation and persecution.' The impact on vulnerable groups, particularly children, has been severe: according to the Executive Director of Cambodia's Child Protection Coalition, Yan Lay, these sounds disrupt children's sleep, trigger nightmares and panic attacks, and hinder their ability to concentrate in school, with long-term consequences for mental health and development. The Commission emphasized that the sonic attacks affect women, children, the elderly, the sick, and disabled, violating their fundamental right to peaceful living. This follows a ceasefire agreement reached in July 2025, brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and confirmed after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of both countries, ending the deadliest border clashes in over a decade, which killed around 40 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. The conflict began near the ancient Ta Moan Tom temple in Thailand\u2019s Surin province and spread across 817 kilometers of contested border, with Cambodia accusing Thailand of conducting airstrikes inside its territory. The self-proclaimed Thai activist Kannawat Pongpibulvech claimed responsibility, stating he acted with approval from the Thai military to monitor border security and expel Cambodian settlers he alleged had invaded Thai land. However, the use of psychological sound warfare raises serious concerns about compliance with international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians. Hun Sen informed Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi of the situation, expressing gratitude for the ceasefire facilitation while voicing concern over ongoing tensions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 03:40 PM\nSource:[mk.ru](https://www.mk.ru/incident/2025/10/20/kambodzha-obvinila-tailand-v-psikhologicheskoy-voyne-s-pomoshhyu-prizrachnykh-zvukov.html)\n\n**Cambodia, Thailand Continue Talks on Border Peace Agreement**\nCambodia and Thailand are continuing peace talks in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the October 26\u201328 ASEAN Summit, focusing on mutual troop withdrawals, mine clearance, and the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers detained by Thailand since a ceasefire on July 28 ended five days of intense fighting that killed at least 43 people and displaced over 300,000. Cambodia's Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn stated that the agreement will include restoring diplomatic relations, combating online scams, demining border areas, and withdrawing weapons from border zones. Thailand has agreed to release the 18 soldiers 'without delay' after the agreement is signed, but insists on four conditions: troop withdrawal from border areas, joint demining, cooperation in eliminating cyber scams targeting Thais, and resettlement of Cambodian citizens alleged to have encroached into Thai territory. Thai military spokesperson Maj. Gen. Withai Laithomya reiterated that the release is contingent on Cambodia fulfilling these demands. Cambodia\u2019s Prime Minister Hun Manet clarified that the agreement will not involve territorial concessions, emphasizing it is about establishing 'conditions and codes of conduct' to restore peace and relations. Despite progress on troop withdrawals and mine clearance, trust remains low, and nationalist sentiment in both countries limits negotiable ground. The U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend the ASEAN Summit and preside over the signing of the 'Kuala Lumpur Declaration,' though his attendance remains unconfirmed. The agreement is seen as a necessary first step toward normalizing relations, but unlikely to resolve the underlying border dispute rooted in the 1907 French Indochina\u2013Siam treaty, which would require independent demarcation, territorial compromises, and possible land exchanges.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 12:40 PM\nSource:[The Diplomat Magazine](https://thediplomat.com/2025/10/cambodia-thailand-continue-talks-on-border-peace-agreement/)\n\n**Sudan Under Fire: Drone Strikes Kill Civilians, UN Warns of Impending Humanitarian Catastrophe**\nThe United Nations warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Sudan due to escalating violence across multiple regions, emphasizing that civilians are bearing the brunt of the conflict. According to UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric, armed clashes intensified in North and West Darfur, with a drone strike on the main market in Seraf Omarah killing at least seven civilians, and similar attacks in al-Jinina, the capital of West Darfur, causing additional casualties. Tensions also rose in West Kordofan, where nearly 1,000 people fled the town of Lqaawa due to deteriorating security, while the cities of Dilling and Kadugli in South Kordofan remain under siege with disrupted supplies and shortages of basic goods. In the Blue Nile state, reports indicate that fighting between armed groups displaced around 600 people from the town of But in the Tamaan locality last week. Dujarric affirmed that humanitarian workers continue to deliver aid in accessible areas despite severe field challenges and called for an 'immediate cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians, and unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance to all affected areas.' The conflict in Sudan began on April 15, 2023, between the Sudanese Armed Forces led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), resulting in hundreds of deaths, thousands of injuries, widespread internal displacement, and a deepening humanitarian emergency. Despite regional and international mediation efforts, no lasting ceasefire has been achieved, with growing warnings of an imminent humanitarian catastrophe if fighting continues.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 01:34 PM\nSource:[\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627 | \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0627](https://www.eanlibya.com/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%aa%d8%ad%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%a7%d8%b1-%d8%ba%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%aa%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%af%d9%86%d9%8a%d9%8a%d9%86-%d9%88%d8%a7/)\n\n**Video shows Thai-Cambodian border temple argument, not incursion into Bangladesh**\nA 14-second video circulating online on October 4, 2025, falsely claimed to show the Arakan Army, an ethnic armed group from Myanmar, entering Bangladesh and attacking Bengali families, following violent protests in Khagrachari district that left three people dead on September 28.

According to the Khmer Times, Hun Manet expressed gratitude to Trump for initiating and supporting the ceasefire, which is expected to lead to a peace agreement in Malaysia, assuming circumstances remain unchanged. He also thanked the Chinese leadership and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The agreement, which aims to end the prolonged border tensions between Phnom Penh and Bangkok, is set to be signed during the 47th ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur at the end of October 2025. A four-party consultation in Kuala Lumpur involving Malaysia and the U.S. had previously led to consensus on the document. The conflict began on July 24, 2025, near the disputed border zone in Cambodia\u2019s Oddar Meanchey province, when armed clashes erupted, prompting Thailand to use fighter jets in response to Cambodia\u2019s use of heavy weapons. Cambodia claimed its forces were acting in self-defense. Malaysia\u2019s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced a ceasefire on July 28, 2025, following talks in Kuala Lumpur. Despite this, subsequent incidents occurred, including Thai soldiers being injured by landmines and, in late September, Cambodian forces reportedly shelling Thai territory with small arms and grenade launchers, prompting Thailand to place its military on alert.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 04:39 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/world/55494474-premer-kambodzhi-poblagodaril-trampa-za-pomosch-v-uregulirovanii-s-tailandom/)\n\n**ACLED Regional Overview Asia-Pacific: October 2025 - Myanmar**\nIn October 2025, ACLED reported significant escalations in violence across the Asia-Pacific region. In Myanmar, Rohingya militant activity in Rakhine state reached a 2025 monthly high with 11 recorded events in September, including coordinated attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on the United League for Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA) in Maungdaw. The clashes, lasting from 16 to 27 September, resulted in hundreds of militant casualties and at least five civilian deaths. Four Rohingya armed groups, including ARSA, are operating in a loose alliance aiming to seize control of Buthidaung, Maungdaw, and Rathedaung from the ULA/AA, with allegations of support from Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) and possible links to the Myanmar military. Informal border trade has halted as tensions rise. In Nepal, anti-government demonstrations led by Gen-Z activists erupted on 8 September following a social media ban, escalating into deadly violence. Police used live ammunition in Kathmandu and Itahari, killing over 60 demonstrators, and setting fire to Parliament and the Supreme Court. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned the next day, and interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki was appointed on 12 September, with Parliament dissolved and new elections scheduled for 5 March 2026. The protests stemmed from youth frustration over corruption, unemployment, and inequality, originating from the #nepobabies movement. In Pakistan\u2019s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, TTP and Hafiz Gul Bahadur (HGB) militants carried out deadly attacks, prompting military counterterrorism operations that killed at least 30 militants. On 22 September, a raid in the Tirah valley allegedly involved airstrikes, killing at least 10 civilians and 14 militants, sparking controversy and calls for investigation, though the military has not confirmed aerial involvement. Fatalities from violence more than doubled in September despite a drop in overall event frequency. In Papua New Guinea, retaliatory violence between the Yangakuni and Yakuman tribes in Wapenamanda district resumed after a failed truce, triggered by the killing of two Yakuman men following an assassination attempt on MP Miki Kaeok. The violence disrupted education, roads, and courts, prompting the National Court in Wabag to issue interim orders banning hostilities, weapons, and roadblocks, with penalties for contempt. In the Philippines, mass protests on 21 September against government corruption drew at least 100,000 participants in Manila and Quezon City. While most demonstrations were peaceful, the Manila march turned violent when masked youths attacked police, resulting in two deaths and 216 arrests, including 91 minors. A brawl erupted on EDSA between pro-Duterte and anti-Duterte groups, with calls for President Marcos Jr. to resign. The protests followed Senate inquiries into substandard infrastructure projects and were timed to coincide with the 53rd anniversary of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos Sr., marking a fourfold increase in protest activity compared to August.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 02:11 AM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-asia-pacific-october-2025)\n\n**Cambodia Accuses Thailand of Psychological Warfare Using Ghost Sounds**\nTensions along the Cambodian-Thai border have taken a surreal turn, with Cambodia's Senate Chairman Hun Sen accusing Thailand of using 'ghost sounds' as a tool of psychological warfare.

The conflict, which escalated after Limbani residents attacked Coasa residents in the Sahuana sector, led to a deadly confrontation involving police and armed individuals. According to reports, one person was killed and two others were detained (suspected Limbani residents). Two civilians, Demetrio G\u00f3mez (wounded in the leg) and Flora Calcina (wounded in the abdomen), were injured and unable to be evacuated due to continuous gunfire. Both victims were reportedly not involved in the conflict but were traveling when attacked. The Inambari River was blockaded by armed individuals, isolating entire communities such as Huanacuri and Jatun Yunca. Residents reported being 'held hostage in their own territory,' with no access to food, medical care, or emergency evacuation. The police attempted to break the blockade, resulting in the death of one person and two arrests. The president of the Coasa Defense Front, Ali Z\u00e1rate Calsina, accused Belinda Cabada, a regional mediator, of failing to act despite documented requests for mediation in 2024. Coasa issued a one-week ultimatum to restart dialogue, warning of a potential blockade of the Interoceanic Highway if no response is received. Three communities\u2014Huanicachi, Huayruruni, and Jatun Yunka\u2014reported invasions. The Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo and the Superintendencia were notified, but responses have been slow. The situation echoes a similar conflict in 2023, when Cabada canceled key meetings, leading to accusations of partiality.

It traces the dispute back to colonial times: in 1904 the temple was assigned to Siam, but a 1907 French map placed it in Cambodian territory; Thailand did not protest until the 1930s. After French troops withdrew in 1953, Thai troops entered the area, prompting Cambodia to bring the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1959. The ICJ ruled in Cambodia\u2019s favour in 1962, citing Thailand\u2019s delayed protest as tacit consent, and a 2013 ICJ ruling reaffirmed Cambodian sovereignty over the entire promontory. The temple was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008, which intensified tensions that peaked in 2011.\n\nOn 24\u202fJuly\u202f2025, clashes erupted along the border, with each side accusing the other of opening fire first. A May\u202f28\u202f2025 incident resulted in the death of a Cambodian and led to the suspension of Thai Prime Minister Paetrongtarn\u202fShinawatra on 1\u202fJuly\u202f2025 after a leaked call with former Cambodian Prime Minister Hung\u202fSen. The conflict has escalated to artillery and rocket fire, with allegations that cluster munitions were used.\n\nThe author notes that the weapons employed are largely outdated, which has limited casualties, but suggests the situation could spark a regional arms race. US Defense Secretary Pete\u202fHegseth is quoted as saying 'I told you so,' in reference to a recent defence\u2011sales pitch. The article discusses how the conflict tests ASEAN\u2019s mediation role and provides China an opportunity to position itself as a neutral broker, while the United States seeks to curb Chinese influence.\n\nThe piece concludes that the dispute will serve as a barometer for ASEAN\u2019s diplomatic strength and that the conflict\u2019s outcome could reshape regional security dynamics.

The clash near the disputed Dangrek Mountains escalated into one of the region's worst cross-border conflicts in years, reviving historical tensions and straining diplomatic ties. Although a ceasefire now holds, the fragile calm masks unresolved issues rooted in colonial-era borders, ancient temples, and nationalist rhetoric. The dispute traces back to a 1907 map drawn during French colonial rule over Cambodia, which left ambiguities and contested areas, particularly those with ancient Khmer temples. Prasat Preah Vihear, an 11th-century temple, remains the epicentre of this dispute, with Thailand rejecting International Court of Justice jurisdiction over the surrounding area. Another flashpoint is Prasat Ta Muen Thom, a 12th-century temple in Thailand's Surin province, which fuels competing sovereignty claims due to its historical ties to the Khmer Empire. Despite shared cultural heritage, including many Thai citizens speaking Khmer in Surin, the divide remains, with leaders on both sides leveraging the temples to assert territorial and historical rights, as said by a local, 'It's a complex issue that goes beyond just borders, it's about identity and history.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 10, 2025 03:18 AM\nSource:[The New Indian Express](https://www.newindianexpress.com/explainers/2025/Aug/10/guns-fall-silent-wounds-remain-open-on-thailand-cambodia-border)\n\n**Thailand and Cambodia Agree to Ceasefire Amid Border Clashes**\nThe conflict between Thailand and Cambodia has its roots in a dispute over border sovereignty that dates back to 1950. The issue was first centered around the ownership of the Preah Vihear temple, which was resolved in favor of Cambodia by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1962. However, the problem persisted and remained latent during the following decades, particularly during Cambodia's civil war. The lack of a joint demarcation of some sections of the border between the two countries kept the dispute alive. The conflict resurfaced in 2008 after Cambodia nominated the Preah Vihear temple as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Thai protests against their own government followed. The subsequent military clashes led to a new request for clarification to the ICJ, which issued a resolution in 2013. The dispute expanded to include other overlapping border areas, such as the ancient Khmer temples of Prasat Ta Muen Thom and Prasat Ta Krabey. After more than a decade without conflict, tensions flared again in May with the death of a Cambodian soldier in a battle between the two armies on the border. Thailand seeks a bilateral agreement, while Cambodia has taken the issue to the ICJ. Despite the territorial component of the conflict, its outbreak has sparked speculation about the true reasons for the confrontation between the two countries. Thailand and Cambodia agreed to an unconditional and immediate ceasefire from midnight on July 29, according to Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This is a significant step towards resolving five days of deadly border clashes that left dozens dead and displaced.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 28, 2025 03:27 PM\nSource:[Clarin](https://www.clarin.com/mundo/origen-conflicto-tailandia-camboya_0_Tl7YCFIz1t.html)\n\n**Thailand-Cambodia clash displaces 200,000 -- is peace still possible?**\nTensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated following landmine explosions that wounded several Thai soldiers. Both sides have traded blame for border infractions and provocations, particularly around contested temple complexes. The border disputes stem from ambiguous demarcations under the Franco-Siamese treaties of 1904-07 and the ongoing dispute over the Preah Vihear and other ancient temple complexes. The International Court of Justice awarded Preah Vihear to Cambodia in 1962, but surrounding land remains contested, causing episodic flare-ups. Recent fighting on July 24, 2025, included shelling, rocket fire, and airstrikes, with Thailand confirming attacks against Cambodian positions in retaliation for artillery strikes that killed civilians in Thai border provinces.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 28, 2025 03:57 AM\nSource:[GULF NEWS](https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/thailand-cambodia-clash-displaces-170000-is-peace-still-possible-1.500213312)\n\n**Preah Vihear at the heart of Thailand-Cambodia clash that killed 30, displaced 130,000**\nA century-old dispute over the ownership and control of ancient Khmer Hindu temples, particularly the 11th-12th century Preah Vihear temple, has reignited a deadly Thailand-Cambodia border conflict that has killed over 30 and displaced more than 130,000. Foreign policy expert Brahma Chellaney said, 'the Thai-Cambodian border conflict centers largely on the ownership and control of ancient Khmer Hindu temples, with the 11th-12th century Preah Vihear temple as the most prominent historical flashpoint.' The conflict has its roots in 1907, when French colonial administrators drew the border between French-controlled Cambodia and independent Thailand, and has been exacerbated by competing claims over the temple and surrounding areas. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has awarded sovereignty of Preah Vihear to Cambodia, but Thailand has never fully accepted this decision. The current crisis erupted on July 24 near the Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple complex, with both nations accusing each other of aggression and imposing economic sanctions. 'This is an armed invasion,' said Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, while Thailand's National Security Council claimed that Cambodian forces deployed surveillance drones over Thai positions and opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 26, 2025 02:02 PM\nSource:[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraphindia.com/gallery/preah-vihear-at-the-heart-of-thailand-cambodia-clash-that-killed-30-displaced-130000-photogallery/cid/2115137)\n\n**Massive Educational Closure in Cambodia and Thailand due to Escalating Border Conflict**\nDue to the escalation of armed conflicts in the region of historical temples, authorities in Cambodia and Thailand have ordered the closure of over 1,000 schools in the border area. According to Sputnik, the decision was made to ensure the safety of civilians, teachers, and students. In Cambodia, 260 schools in the Oddar Meanchey province were closed, as stated by Vice-Governor Met Measpheakdey, who emphasized that the decision was made due to 'concerns for the safety of teachers and students' following military incursions into national territory. In Thailand, the Basic Education Commission ordered the immediate closure of 751 schools in high-risk areas, including Surin (233 schools), Sisaket (132), and Ubon Ratchathani (95). The tension escalated after a clash on May 28 in Chong Bok, where a Cambodian soldier was killed, and on July 24, five Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine near the Chong An Ma border crossing. Thai authorities blame Cambodian troops for placing the explosives. Thailand has reported at least 15 deaths and 46 injuries as a result of the clashes, with tens of thousands of people displaced from their homes. The conflict between the two nations dates back many years, with disputes over ancient temples such as Preah Vihear, Ta Muen Thom, and Ta Krabey, located in the Emerald Triangle. Cambodia has promoted a judicial resolution through the International Court of Justice, which previously ruled in its favor regarding Preah Vihear. Thailand has rejected the court's jurisdiction and proposed bilateral negotiations, making a definitive solution difficult.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 01:12 PM\nSource:[AVN](https://avn.info.ve/cierre-educativo-masivo-en-camboya-y-tailandia-por-escalada-belica-en-zona-de-templos-historicos/)\n\n**Thailand-Cambodia Border Conflict Escalates, Threatening to Deteriorate into War**\nThe ongoing conflict between Thailand and Cambodia at the disputed border has resulted in dozens of deaths and injuries. The situation could 'd\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer en guerre' (degenerate into war), warned Bangkok ahead of an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council scheduled for Friday. After months of escalating tensions over territorial disputes, the two countries exchanged fire at their shared border in the Preah Vihear region on Thursday and Friday. According to The New York Times, the violence has been unprecedented since 2011, with over 20 deaths and 46 injuries in Thailand, and 1 death and 5 injuries in Cambodia. The Thai government claims that Cambodia fired rockets at civilian areas in four Thai provinces, prompting Thailand to send F-16 fighter jets. Cambodia, however, asserts that Thai soldiers fired first at Cambodian troops at Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple, which is claimed by both nations, and that Cambodian forces retaliated 15 minutes later. The disputes over the border, which spans over 800 kilometers, and temple ownership have led to decades of conflict that international courts have failed to resolve. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has called for an 'immediate ceasefire' and offered to mediate the conflict, while the European Union and China have expressed concern and urged the two parties to resume dialogue.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 10:55 AM\nSource:[Courrier international](https://www.courrierinternational.com/video/video-les-images-des-affrontements-a-la-frontiere-entre-la-thailande-et-le-cambodge_233496)\n\n**Thailand Evacuates Over 100,000 Civilians Amid Worst Military Confrontations with Cambodia in Over a Decade**\nThe Thai government announced on Friday (July 25, local time) that over 100,000 people had been evacuated from border areas with Cambodia due to the worst military confrontations in more than a decade between the two Southeast Asian countries. On Thursday, a decades-old territorial dispute escalated into intense hostilities between the two kingdoms, with the mobilization of fighter jets, artillery, tanks, and infantry, which have concerned the international community. The Thai Interior Ministry stated that 100,672 people from the four border provinces had been taken to around 300 temporary shelters. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry raised the death toll in the clashes from 12 to 14 people - one soldier and 13 civilians. These battles represent a dramatic escalation in an old dispute between these two neighbors, who share 800 km of border and attract millions of foreign tourists every year. Dozens of kilometers of this border, marked by ancient temples, are still in dispute. Between 2008 and 2011, clashes between the two left 28 dead and tens of thousands displaced. A decision in favor of Cambodia by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) of the UN resolved this crisis for a decade, but the tension returned to the surface in May with the death of a Cambodian soldier in a new confrontation. The battles on Thursday took place in six distinct points, including two ancient temples, according to the Thai Army. At the request of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, the UN Security Council will meet on Friday, in an emergency and closed session, to address the conflict. The United States and France have called for an immediate end to the hostilities, while the European Union and China have expressed great concern about the clashes and advocated for dialogue.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 02:57 AM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**Thailand Launches Airstrikes Amid Border Dispute with Cambodia | CSIS**\nThailand and Cambodia have entered open conflict over a long-term border dispute, exchanging gunfire and airstrikes in the deadliest clash between the two countries in over a decade. The conflict began on July 24, 2025, when Cambodian forces opened fire on Thai soldiers and facilities near the Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple complex. Thailand has confirmed at least 13 civilian deaths as a result of Cambodian attacks, while Cambodia has claimed that Thai soldiers were the first to open fire. The dispute has a long history, dating back to 2008, when Cambodia registered the Preah Vihear temple complex as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The conflict has escalated tensions between the two countries, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. ASEAN has called for a cessation of hostilities, but the organization's response has been mixed, with some member states expressing concern and others remaining silent. International partners, including Japan, the European Union, and China, have also responded to the crisis, calling for de-escalation and dialogue. The United States has been slower to respond, with the State Department issuing brief statements urging U.S. citizens to avoid affected border areas. The crisis has significant implications for regional and international relations, and will be a test of ASEAN's ability to resolve conflicts between member states.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 09:04 PM\nSource:[Center For Strategic & International Studies](https://www.csis.org/analysis/thailand-launches-airstrikes-amid-border-dispute-cambodia)\n\n**Thailand and Cambodia Engage in Border Dispute, Leaving at Least 12 Dead**\nAt least 12 Thais were killed and 17 others injured in a new flare-up of tensions along the disputed border between Thailand and Cambodia. The two armies have been exchanging rocket fire, deploying fighter jets, and downgrading their diplomatic relations to their lowest level in decades. The Thai army has deployed F-16 fighter jets that targeted Cambodian military sites, while Phnom Penh has responded with rocket fire, forcing hundreds of civilians from both sides of the border to flee. The two countries have been disputing a portion of the border between the Cambodian province of Preah Vihear and the Thai province of Ubon Ratchathani in the northeast of Thailand. The tensions have escalated since May 28, when a Cambodian soldier was killed, allegedly in cross-border fire. The latest escalation was triggered by the laying of landmines in the disputed area, causing explosions and injuries. The border crisis has also had political repercussions in Thailand, with the suspension of former Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, following the leak of a private phone call between her and former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen. In the recording, Paetongtarn calls Hun 'tonton' and makes disparaging comments about a high-ranking Thai military commander. 'It is deeply condemnable that this act of aggression occurs while Cambodia is actively pursuing peaceful and impartial legal avenues to resolve border disputes,' said Prime Minister Hun Manet. He has also filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) following the new tensions on May 28. The conflict has been ongoing since 2008, with each side accusing the other of starting the hostilities. The last major flare-up was in 2011, with at least 15 deaths and tens of thousands of civilians displaced. The fighting has focused on a forested border area housing ancient temples claimed by both sides. After seven days of fighting, a ceasefire was declared. The Thai government has claimed that the demarcation was not yet complete for certain external parts of the adjacent zone to the Preah Vihear temple, which the ICJ had awarded to Cambodia by a nine-to-three decision in 1962. In 2011, a UN tribunal ordered both neighbors to withdraw their forces and establish a demilitarized zone, without ruling on the control of a larger disputed territory where fighting continued. In November 2013, the ICJ confirmed Cambodia's sovereignty over the entire territory of the Preah Vihear temple, ordering Thailand to withdraw its military forces from the area. The Cambodian Prime Minister has now officially requested the UN Security Council to intervene quickly in the face of what he calls 'premeditated military aggression.' 'It is deeply condemnable that this act of aggression occurs while Cambodia is actively pursuing peaceful and impartial legal avenues to resolve border disputes,' said Prime Minister Hun Manet. He has also filed a complaint with the ICJ following the new tensions on May 28.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 01:28 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/fr/monde/pourquoi-la-tha%C3%AFlande-et-le-cambodge-se-disputent-ils-la-fronti%C3%A8re-/3640981)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts overwhelmingly assess the probability that conflict between Thailand and Cambodia will result in 500 deaths from March 28 to December 31, 2025 as very low, typically estimating chances in the 3\u20137% range. Experts with backgrounds in military strategy, crisis management, peace and conflict studies, diplomatic mediation, and international relations draw upon the following shared points: \n\n- The recent escalation (May\u2013July 2025) was the deadliest in a decade, resulting in approximately 40\u201345 deaths, but still an order of magnitude below the 500-death threshold. \n- Historic base rates for this border dispute\u2014specifically during the 2008\u20132011 crisis\u2014were similarly low, with no episodes approaching hundreds of fatalities in a single year, let alone in just a few months. \n- A ceasefire has held since late July 2025 amid ongoing diplomatic talks (e.g., Joint Border Committee), peacebuilding measures (troop withdrawals, prisoner exchanges, demining), and mounting international mediation efforts (notably via ASEAN, Malaysia, the US, and China; with a peace agreement targeted at the ASEAN Summit). \n- Multiple experts note the strong external and internal incentives for restraint: economic interdependence, the recent mass displacement of civilians, and the reputational/strategic costs of renewed, uncontrolled escalation. \n- Risks remain from unresolved nationalist and territorial grievances, domestic pressures facing both governments, low trust, sporadic incidents (including landmines and psychological operations), and the possibility of accidents or local dynamics triggering renewed violence\u2014but these are seen as likely sources of minor incidents, not prolonged, high-casualty warfare.\n\nWhile several types of scenario could theoretically result in 500+ deaths (e.g., collapse of talks, a major provocation, or rogue action sparking days of heavy fighting), all experts note that such an event would require a dramatic, historically unprecedented breakdown of current restraint mechanisms\u2014the ceasefire, active mediation, and regional/international diplomatic engagement.\n\nOverall, the consensus is that while a very low-probability 'black swan' escalation cannot be ruled out entirely, the pattern of conflict so far as well as ongoing peace initiatives make such mass-casualty fighting highly unlikely before January 2026.",
