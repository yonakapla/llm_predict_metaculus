Exempted categories provide only limited compensating volume. November\u2019s US import value from Brazil falls well below November 2024\u2019s $3.98 billion, consistent with a typical 20-60% bilateral trade drop in the wake of acute tariffs.",

Imports of major Brazilian goods, especially inelastic items (oil, some agricultural products), remain robust; some may even rebound sharply as importers restock following depleted inventories in August-October. US import value in November 2025 meets or slightly exceeds the $3.98B benchmark, thanks to base growth and/or a sharp tariff removal rally.",

Supply chain adaptation (finding alternative suppliers or customers) is already underway, and news of rushed pre-tariff shipments would have reduced the US order book for late Q4. While there is a nontrivial probability that a partial suspension or carveout is reached\u2014higher than if both sides were in a public standoff\u2014the cumulative evidence suggests the most probable scenario is a marked drop in US imports from Brazil for November 2025 versus November 2024, with the only major caveat being whether any late-October diplomatic breakthrough triggers immediate tariff suspension. Given the overwhelming downward pressure of the imposed tariffs, and applying a conservative base rate from similar situations, I assess the chance that November 2025 imports from Brazil exceed those of November 2024 as low, but not zero; last-minute negotiations or product carveouts do pose risk.

Data demonstrates that sharp tariffs of this magnitude often lead to 20%-40% declines within the first full calendar month of effect, and persistent reductions if not immediately reversed. Although 700 HS codes are exempt, the lion's share of Brazil's top export earners to the US (oil, coffee, sugar) appear targeted based on press coverage and lack of detail by officials on extensive carve-outs. Diplomatic noises point to openness to negotiation, but with just 4-6 weeks before contracts for November shipments would need to be finalized, even a swift compromise would likely come too late to restore prior volumes. The status quo would demand at least stable trade, but the timing, scope, and political frost make a rebound highly improbable. Thus, while a complete collapse is unlikely thanks to the exempted products and some contracts in the pipeline, a decline in November 2025 US imports from Brazil relative to November 2024 is, from a pure trade analyst's point of view, very probable.

While there is strong diplomatic signaling of a possible future deal, no reversal or significant exemption has been enacted or scheduled as of late September, and practical shipment, pricing, and customs lags mean that even if a deal were struck in late October, there would be insufficient time to restore November's flow to 2024 levels. Some partial mitigation may occur (exclusions, price inelasticity for e.g., sugar), but base rates for trade wars indicate durable dampening of bilateral flows. Given the scale of the tariff, and lack of a concrete, time-certain reversal or broad exclusion, the probability that November 2025 US imports from Brazil will exceed November 2024 is low, especially as the comparison month (Nov 2024) was not depressed.

The potential mitigating factors (product exemptions, strong institutional willingness to negotiate) are notable, but progress toward a negotiated suspension of the tariffs before November is at best ambiguous as of late September. Given the partial exemption list (notably oil, iron ore, aircraft, and perhaps sugar), there could be some stabilization of trade volume, but these likely cannot compensate for major drops elsewhere across commodities subject to the full 50% rate. There is some chance for a November surprise reversal (especially given mutual signaling and market optimism reflected in the brief Bovespa rally after Trump-Lula 'chemistry'), but as of this forecast, pipeline effects and exemption mitigation are unlikely to fully offset the downside shock of a sweeping new tariff regime. Historically, such trade shocks have outsized immediate effects, and business sentiment is likely to suppress new US imports through November. A moderate probability (20\u201335%) exists for a negotiated resolution in the next 4\u20136 weeks resulting in partial or full rollback, but not enough to make 'Yes' the base case.

Overall, US imports from Brazil drop sharply from November 2024\u2019s $3.98B, possibly by 20\u201340%.

While political rhetoric and diplomatic openings exist\u2014both sides have expressed willingness to negotiate\u2014the process has not produced actual changes. Negotiation windows are short (less than 6 weeks to impact November shipping, given lead times). Previous rounds of this kind of trade war (e.g., US\u2013China) show that trade flows usually collapse even if talks are ongoing, unless or until formal suspension is signed. The partial mitigating factor is the structural dependence of key US supply chains (especially for cane sugar, less so coffee/oil) on Brazil, but this is unlikely to fully offset the tariff impact in such a short time. Taking into account the inertia of previous months (imports rising modestly in 2025), but recognizing the power of the tariff shock, I expect a sharp drop in November 2025 versus November 2024 absent an explicit resolution in time. Thus, I rate the likelihood of November 2025 US imports from Brazil exceeding November 2024\u2019s figure as low, but not zero\u2014a 15% chance, mainly on the tail risk of a sudden breakthrough or sectoral carve-outs decided early in October.",

However, the analysis underestimates the inertia involved in supply chain reconfiguration, contract renegotiation, and logistics after a tariff shock enacted in August, especially since product exemptions remain less than clear for Brazil\u2019s key export earners (notably sugar and coffee, both apparently covered by the tariff). Historical trade war data (e.g., US-China 2018\u201319, US steel and aluminum tariffs) show that even when negotiations are underway and key sectors have partial exemptions, the first 3\u20134 months of post-tariff bilateral flows plummet unless and until a concrete policy rollback occurs\u2014something not yet in evidence as of late September.

The likelihood of a major breakthrough or partial deal in October that leads to a tangible November recovery is, as historical precedent shows, slim\u2014particularly as most large buyers will have shifted sourcing and completed contract renegotiation post-tariff announcement. Unless sector carve-outs are not only announced but implemented with ample lead time, the first full quarter after such tariffs almost always sees a persistent dip, regardless of long-run comparative advantage. Additionally, current reporting suggests broad coverage rather than genuine carve-outs for key products like sugar and coffee, reducing further the likelihood that exemptions can rescue November's numbers.

Additionally, you suggest that indispensable commodities might be spared or swiftly reinstated, yet the current reporting from September clearly indicates that some key Brazilian staples (sugar, coffee) are either not exempt or the exemptions remain too vague to bank on. The political friction surrounding the Bolsonaro prosecution adds an unusual degree of complexity to reaching a quick settlement. While you are right to reserve some probability for a November surprise, the bulk of the evidence\u2014including trade finance, contract, logistics, and base rate data\u2014indicates that even a partial resolution is unlikely to restore volume by November 2025.

The forecast exhibits discipline in extrapolating from past cases such as the US-China trade war, emphasizing that talk of negotiation alone is insufficient to reverse the prevailing logistics and contract inertia, especially with just weeks to go until November shipment windows close. The assessment that domestic political cost thresholds (on both sides) for early concession remain unmet further justifies the low probability assigned to a 'Yes' outcome.

Critiques highlight that inertia, logistical/frictional lags, and absence of confirmed carve-outs or formal negotiation breakthroughs make a November rebound very unlikely. Defenses further affirm the base rate for similar shocks, and the limited potential for diplomatic signals to manifest as real trade volume change in the narrow remaining window. No new base rate or empirical consideration surfaced in discussion that would justify increasing my probability. At the same time, the group sees tail risk for a sudden deal, so dropping closer to 10% or lower is not warranted. Thus, my initial 15% estimate remains best-calibrated.",

He could face more than four decades behind bars if found guilty of masterminding the coup.\n\n> Speaking exclusively to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour on Thursday, da Silva, who is widely known as Lula, said that Trump\u2019s threats had broken away from \u201cprotocol\u201d and argued that his predecessor\u2019s fate cannot be part of trade negotiations.\n\nTop products the US imports from Brazil [are](https://www.usimportdata.com/blogs/us-imports-exports-trade-relations-with-brazil) coffee, oil, and sugar. Brazil provides about 37% of America's domestic sugar consumption needs, so a potential trade war could be coming at a time when The Coca-Cola Company [just announced](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/22/trump-coke-cane-sugar) it was switching from high fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its sodas.&#x20;\n\nIn the past couple of years, the US's trade with Brazil has been as follows:\n\n| Year | Month          | Exports (US\\$\u202fm) | Imports (US\\$\u202fm) |   Balance\\* |\n| ---- | -------------- | ---------------: | ---------------: | ----------: |\n| 2023 | January        |          3,592.3 |          3,100.6 |       491.7 |\n| 2023 | February       |          3,586.1 |          2,564.0 |     1,022.0 |\n| 2023 | March          |          4,119.6 |          3,170.1 |       949.5 |\n| 2023 | April          |          3,464.2 |          2,649.7 |       814.5 |\n| 2023 | May            |          4,051.7 |          3,066.0 |       985.6 |\n| 2023 | June           |          3,940.4 |          3,555.7 |       384.7 |\n| 2023 | July           |          3,427.9 |          3,320.5 |       107.4 |\n| 2023 | August         |          3,755.9 |          3,166.2 |       589.7 |\n| 2023 | September      |          3,662.7 |          3,944.0 |      \u2212281.3 |\n| 2023 | October        |          3,580.8 |          3,127.2 |       453.6 |\n| 2023 | November       |          3,623.6 |          3,568.3 |        55.3 |\n| 2023 | December       |          3,734.2 |          3,828.1 |       \u221294.0 |\n| 2023 | **TOTAL\u202f2023** |     **44,539.2** |     **39,060.5** | **5,478.7** |\n| 2024 | January        |          3,514.3 |          3,756.2 |      \u2212242.0 |\n| 2024 | February       |          3,761.7 |          3,152.8 |       608.9 |\n| 2024 | March          |          3,928.1 |          3,181.9 |       746.2 |\n| 2024 | April          |          3,812.3 |          3,247.2 |       565.1 |\n| 2024 | May            |          4,020.4 |          3,702.4 |       318.0 |\n| 2024 | June           |          4,264.4 |          3,383.5 |       880.9 |\n| 2024 | July           |          4,175.8 |          3,537.8 |       638.0 |\n| 2024 | August         |          4,764.0 |          3,940.8 |       823.2 |\n| 2024 | September      |          4,472.5 |          3,327.1 |     1,145.3 |\n| 2024 | October        |          3,937.9 |          3,329.3 |       608.6 |\n| 2024 | November       |          4,167.8 |          3,978.8 |       189.0 |\n| 2024 | December       |          4,317.0 |          3,810.8 |       506.2 |\n| 2024 | **TOTAL\u202f2024** |     **49,136.1** |     **42,348.4** | **6,787.7** |\n| 2025 | January        |          3,855.7 |          3,770.7 |        85.0 |\n| 2025 | February       |          4,073.1 |          3,344.5 |       728.6 |\n| 2025 | March          |          4,654.1 |          3,898.1 |       756.0 |\n| 2025 | April          |          4,254.6 |          3,184.2 |     1,070.5 |\n| 2025 | May            |          4,811.3 |          4,224.1 |       587.1 |\n|      |                |                  |                  |             |\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38918,\"question_id\":38268}}`",

Robertson said the tariffs were imposed after the 2025 UN General Assembly meeting between President Donald Trump and President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and that Trump has been open to negotiations since the start of his term. She noted that the tariffs, which consist of a 10% general tax plus a 40% additional charge, were intended as a tool because previous agreements were not favorable for American companies. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) sent a letter to Lula on July 9 and had already released a March report listing Brazil among countries with high trade barriers. The tariffs were also partly a response to former President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s conviction for an attempted coup, for which he was sentenced to 27 years and 3 months. On September 23, Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad called for the tariffs to end, arguing that politics should be separated from the economy and that a return to institutional dialogue was needed. Robertson told CNN: 'Desde o in\u00edcio do mandato, o presidente Trump deixou claro que est\u00e1 aberto a negociar com qualquer pa\u00eds. Ele decidiu utilizar as tarifas como ferramenta porque considera que os acordos anteriores n\u00e3o foram favor\u00e1veis para as empresas americanas'. She added: 'as tarifas abrem espa\u00e7o para negocia\u00e7\u00f5es entre os 2 pa\u00edses, que podem chegar a um acordo capaz de beneficiar os 2 lados'.

Lula opened the session with a speech condemning what he called \"interference in Brazil\u2019s internal affairs,\" criticizing \"unilateral and arbitrary measures\" against Brazilian institutions and the economy, and calling for an end to the U.S. tariffs imposed in August on Brazilian goods. The tariffs were justified by the U.S. as part of a \"witch\u2011hunt\" against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup after losing the 2022 election.\n\nTrump followed Lula\u2019s remarks with a brief address that highlighted the \"important tariffs\" the U.S. levied on Brazil, citing \"censorship, repression, judicial corruption and persecution of political dissidents\" in the United States. He praised Lula, saying, 'Eu estava entrando e o l\u00edder do Brasil estava saindo: o vi, ele me viu e nos abra\u00e7amos,' and added, 'Eu gostei dele, ele gostou de mim.' Trump described the 39\u2011second encounter as a moment of \"excellent chemistry\" and announced that the two leaders would meet next week, though no details were given.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira later told CNN that the meeting would likely be by phone or video conference because Lula would return to Brazil on Wednesday and has a \"very busy agenda.\" Lula had previously expressed willingness to negotiate, stating, 'Queremos negociar (...) e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 ningu\u00e9m para conversar' in August.\n\nThe U.S. has also imposed 50\u202f% tariffs on several Brazilian products and consular and financial sanctions on Brazilian officials, including Supreme Court justices who sentenced Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro remains in preventive house arrest since August, awaiting a Supreme Court decision on his appeal.\n\nBrazil will hold presidential elections in 2026, in which Lula is expected to seek a fourth term. With Bolsonaro ineligible, the right\u2011wing has yet to nominate a candidate. Eduardo Bolsonaro, Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son, was charged on 23 September with coercion for encouraging Washington\u2019s pressure on Brazil\u2019s judiciary and warned that the U.S. might not recognize the 2026 results.\n\nThe article reports these events factually, citing direct quotes from both leaders and official statements, and provides context on the ongoing U.S.\u2013Brazil trade and diplomatic tensions.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 08:13 PM\nSource:[SWI swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/por/trump-e-lula-na-onu:-farpas,-%22qu%C3%ADmica%22-e-promessa-de-reuni%C3%A3o/90055610)\n\n**Trump to meet Brazil's Lula next week after 'excellent chemistry' at UN**\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced that he will meet Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva next week after a brief encounter at the U.N. General Assembly, where Trump said they had \"excellent chemistry\". Trump reported that the two leaders spoke for about 39 seconds, \"We had a good talk, and we agreed to meet next week,\" and added that \"At least for about 39 seconds, we had excellent chemistry,\" calling it \"a good sign.\" The announcement lifted Brazilian markets: the real firmed roughly 1% against the U.S. dollar and the Bovespa index rose more than 1% to an all\u2011time high, according to the article. Lula, in his address to the Assembly, rebuked U.S. foreign policy, criticizing the Trump administration for imposing tariffs, visa restrictions and financial sanctions in response to the trial and conviction of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump had imposed a 50% tariff on U.S. imports of many Brazilian goods in August, citing a \"witch hunt\" against Bolsonaro, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup. Brazil\u2019s presidency later confirmed the possibility of a conversation between the leaders next week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 04:15 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/Trump-to-meet-Brazils-Lula-next-week-after-excellent-chemistry-at-UN)\n\n**Lula and Trump Meet and Exchange Greetings for the First Time at the UN**\nOn 23\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, Brazilian President Luiz\u202fIn\u00e1cio\u202fLula\u202fda\u202fSilva and former U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump met for the first time during the UN General Assembly in New\u202fYork. According to the article, the two leaders exchanged a brief handshake behind the scenes of the event, a gesture highlighted for its symbolism amid escalating bilateral tensions. The meeting was confirmed by members of the Brazilian delegation and had been speculated since the day before the Assembly, when officials from both governments indicated a greeting might occur. Lula opened the leaders\u2019 session without Trump\u2019s presence in the plenary, and Trump delivered a speech while Lula watched from the audience with his team. The encounter took place at a time when U.S. sanctions under the Global\u202fMagnitsky Act were imposed on Brazilian officials, including visa restrictions and financial blockages, in response to former President Jair\u202fBolsonaro\u2019s alleged coup attempt and other crimes. Trump has accused Brazil of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against his ally, and Washington has criticized the Brazilian Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on big\u2011tech regulation as violations of free speech. Since\u202f6\u202fAugust, Washington has imposed a 50\u202f% tariff on about\u202f60\u202f% of Brazilian goods exported to the U.S., further straining trade relations. The article notes that the meeting occurred during one of the most delicate moments in the 201\u2011year history of Brazil\u2011U.S. relations.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 12:04 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/mundo/lula-e-trump-se-encontram-e-trocam-cumprimentos-pela-1-vez-na-onu)\n\n**Lula Reaffirms Readiness to Negotiate with Trump Over 50% Tariffs**\nOn September 22, 2025, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, while in New\u202fYork preparing to deliver the UN General Assembly opening address, told PBS that he is ready to negotiate with U.S. President Donald Trump over the 50\u202f% tariffs imposed on Brazilian goods. Lula said, 'No momento em que os Estados Unidos desejarem negociar, estaremos prontos para negociar.' He added that his vice\u2011president, finance minister, and foreign minister are prepared, but there is no American counterpart yet. The tariffs stem from Trump\u2019s July letter linking the 2023 trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro to a 'witch hunt' and demanding the trial be halted. Lula also defended Brazil\u2019s sovereignty, stating, 'O que n\u00e3o aceitamos \u00e9 que ningu\u00e9m, nenhum pa\u00eds do mundo interfira na nossa democracia ou na nossa soberania.' The statement came as the U.S. Treasury imposed Global\u202fMagnitsky sanctions on Viviane\u202fBarci\u202fde\u202fMoraes, wife of Supreme Court Justice Alexandre\u202fde\u202fMoraes. Lula emphasized that negotiations could resolve the issue without cost or harm, saying, 'Tudo pode ser resolvido em uma mesa de negocia\u00e7\u00f5es.

He said, '\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u6743\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5546\u8bae' and added, '\u6211\u4ece\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7279\u6717\u666e', '\u7279\u6717\u666e\u4e5f\u4e0d\u8ba4\u8bc6\u6211', while criticizing the U.S. for a 50\u202f% tariff on Brazilian goods, calling it '\u5f88\u8352\u8c2c'. The tariff, imposed on 6\u202fAugust\u202f2024, was a 40\u202f% increase that raised most Brazilian imports to 50\u202f% on top of the 2024 counter\u2011tariff. Lula\u2019s remarks followed a 27\u2011year\u20113\u2011month sentence for former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup. The U.S. owes over $3\u202fbillion to the UN, including $820\u202fmillion for the 2025 budget and unpaid peace\u2011keeping costs. Trump, speaking after Lula, praised the U.S. as a 'golden age', attacked the UN and countries recognizing Palestine, and claimed a brief meeting with Lula: '\u6211\u4eec\u62e5\u62b1\u5728\u4e00\u8d77', promising a meeting next week.

Lula opened the session with a speech condemning what he called \"interference in Brazil\u2019s internal affairs,\" criticizing \"unilateral and arbitrary measures\" against Brazilian institutions and the economy, and calling for an end to the U.S. tariffs imposed in August on Brazilian goods. The tariffs were justified by the U.S. as part of a \"witch\u2011hunt\" against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup after losing the 2022 election.\n\nTrump followed Lula\u2019s remarks with a brief address that highlighted the \"important tariffs\" the U.S. levied on Brazil, citing \"censorship, repression, judicial corruption and persecution of political dissidents\" in the United States. He praised Lula, saying, 'Eu estava entrando e o l\u00edder do Brasil estava saindo: o vi, ele me viu e nos abra\u00e7amos,' and added, 'Eu gostei dele, ele gostou de mim.' Trump described the 39\u2011second encounter as a moment of \"excellent chemistry\" and announced that the two leaders would meet next week, though no details were given.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira later told CNN that the meeting would likely be by phone or video conference because Lula would return to Brazil on Wednesday and has a \"very busy agenda.\" Lula had previously expressed willingness to negotiate, stating, 'Queremos negociar (...) e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 ningu\u00e9m para conversar' in August.\n\nThe U.S. has also imposed 50\u202f% tariffs on several Brazilian products and consular and financial sanctions on Brazilian officials, including Supreme Court justices who sentenced Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro remains in preventive house arrest since August, awaiting a Supreme Court decision on his appeal.\n\nBrazil will hold presidential elections in 2026, in which Lula is expected to seek a fourth term. With Bolsonaro ineligible, the right\u2011wing has yet to nominate a candidate. Eduardo Bolsonaro, Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son, was charged on 23 September with coercion for encouraging Washington\u2019s pressure on Brazil\u2019s judiciary and warned that the U.S. might not recognize the 2026 results.\n\nThe article reports these events factually, citing direct quotes from both leaders and official statements, and provides context on the ongoing U.S.\u2013Brazil trade and diplomatic tensions.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 08:13 PM\nSource:[SWI swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/por/trump-e-lula-na-onu:-farpas,-%22qu%C3%ADmica%22-e-promessa-de-reuni%C3%A3o/90055610)\n\n**Tarc\u00edsio says Lula and Trump 'must talk', after U.S. president's signal**\nThe governor of S\u00e3o\u202fPaulo, Tarc\u00edsio de\u202fFreitas (Republicanos), called for a dialogue between Brazilian President Luiz\u202fIn\u00e1cio\u202fLula\u202fda\u202fSilva and U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump after the American leader invited a conversation following the imposition of tariffs on Brazilian goods.

He added that he had not attended the presidents\u2019 speeches at the United Nations General Assembly. The governor, who is a candidate for the 2026 presidential election, had initially supported Trump\u2019s tariff announcement but has since shifted to advocating negotiation.

Trump reported that the two leaders spoke for about 39 seconds, \"We had a good talk, and we agreed to meet next week,\" and added that \"At least for about 39 seconds, we had excellent chemistry,\" calling it \"a good sign.\" The announcement lifted Brazilian markets: the real firmed roughly 1% against the U.S. dollar and the Bovespa index rose more than 1% to an all\u2011time high, according to the article. Lula, in his address to the Assembly, rebuked U.S. foreign policy, criticizing the Trump administration for imposing tariffs, visa restrictions and financial sanctions in response to the trial and conviction of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump had imposed a 50% tariff on U.S. imports of many Brazilian goods in August, citing a \"witch hunt\" against Bolsonaro, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup.

According to the article, the two leaders exchanged a brief handshake behind the scenes of the event, a gesture highlighted for its symbolism amid escalating bilateral tensions. The meeting was confirmed by members of the Brazilian delegation and had been speculated since the day before the Assembly, when officials from both governments indicated a greeting might occur. Lula opened the leaders\u2019 session without Trump\u2019s presence in the plenary, and Trump delivered a speech while Lula watched from the audience with his team. The encounter took place at a time when U.S. sanctions under the Global\u202fMagnitsky Act were imposed on Brazilian officials, including visa restrictions and financial blockages, in response to former President Jair\u202fBolsonaro\u2019s alleged coup attempt and other crimes. Trump has accused Brazil of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against his ally, and Washington has criticized the Brazilian Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on big\u2011tech regulation as violations of free speech. Since\u202f6\u202fAugust, Washington has imposed a 50\u202f% tariff on about\u202f60\u202f% of Brazilian goods exported to the U.S., further straining trade relations.

The article reports that Eduardo, who has been living in the U.S. for months, was accused of threatening judicial authorities and other powers to obtain U.S. sanctions if the process did not end as desired for his father. The prosecutor described the threats as \u2018inequ\u00edvocas y consistentes\u2019 and aimed to \u2018someter los intereses de la Rep\u00fablica y de toda la colectividad a sus propios designios personales\u2019. The influencer Paulo Figueiredo was also charged for the same reasons. The prosecutor declined to charge Jair Bolsonaro. The indictment coincided with the U.S. announcing new sanctions against Brazil, including a 50\u202f% punitive tariff on certain Brazilian exports, a measure imposed by former President Trump in response to what he called a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 against Bolsonaro. The White House had previously threatened Brazil with further measures after the Supreme Court ruling against Bolsonaro. Washington also sanctioned the wife of Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes and a family\u2011owned company. Eduardo Bolsonaro linked his indictment to the new sanctions, stating on X that \u2018this underscores that political persecution continues.

The sanctions list includes Viviane Barci de Moraes, wife of Supreme Court minister Alexandre de Moraes, and the suspension of the Attorney General of the Union, Jorge Messias, among others. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the sanctions would serve as an \u2018alert\u2019 to those who \u2018threaten U.S. interests by protecting and enabling agents such as Moraes\u2019. The article notes that the Brazilian Ministry of Health described the restrictions as \u2018unfounded and arbitrary\u2019 and that Minister Alexandre Padilha was allowed entry with travel restrictions, which ultimately led him to cancel his UN trip.\n\nSeparately, the article details former President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff order signed on 31\u202fJuly, which imposed a 50\u202f% tariff on Brazilian exports to the United States. The tariff consists of a 10\u202f% rate announced in April plus an additional 40\u202f% announced in early July, effective 6\u202fAugust.

Lula said, 'No momento em que os Estados Unidos desejarem negociar, estaremos prontos para negociar.' He added that his vice\u2011president, finance minister, and foreign minister are prepared, but there is no American counterpart yet. The tariffs stem from Trump\u2019s July letter linking the 2023 trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro to a 'witch hunt' and demanding the trial be halted. Lula also defended Brazil\u2019s sovereignty, stating, 'O que n\u00e3o aceitamos \u00e9 que ningu\u00e9m, nenhum pa\u00eds do mundo interfira na nossa democracia ou na nossa soberania.'

The article frames his appearance against the backdrop of the most severe diplomatic crisis between Brazil and the United States in 201\u202fyears, triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of 50\u202f% tariffs on Brazilian goods, sanctions on Brazilian officials such as Alexandre de Moraes, and a threat to link the tariffs to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula has publicly rejected negotiating the tariff end and has described the US pressure as 'chantagem e interfer\u00eancia na soberania nacional', according to the article. In a BBC interview, Lula said 'Eu n\u00e3o tenho nenhuma rela\u00e7\u00e3o com o Trump', a statement the article cites. The piece notes that the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the country was studying new sanctions after Bolsonaro\u2019s 27\u2011year sentence, and that NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned Brazil could face sanctions for buying Russian fuel. Experts quoted \u2013 Carolina Pedroso of Unifesp and Paulo Velasco of UERJ \u2013 argue that while the strained US relationship may give the impression of isolation, Lula\u2019s active engagement in multilateral forums and his alliances with the BRICS, the G20, the G7, France, China, and the EU mitigate that perception. The article reports that Lula visited Russia in May 2024, China in June, France, the UK, and the G7, and that he met G20 leaders in Rio in November 2024. It also notes that the UN General Assembly is not a venue for formal agreements but can host informal bilateral meetings; Lula is expected to meet with UN Secretary\u2011General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Swedish king and queen, and TikTok executive Shou Zi Chew. The article concludes that Lula\u2019s presence at the UN is likely to be seen as familiar and comfortable rather than isolated, despite the ongoing tensions with Washington.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:33 PM\nSource:[Correio Braziliense](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/mundo/2025/09/7253969-fortalecido-ou-isolado-como-lula-chega-a-assembleia-geral-da-onu.html)\n\n**Brazil's Haddad Sees 'Signal' of US Openness to Tariff Talks**\nBrazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad stated on Tuesday (29) that there is 'a signal' of the United States opening up to dialogue regarding the impending imposition of tariffs by the government of Donald Trump on Brazil. The 50% surtax on Brazilian products, announced by Trump on July 9, is set to take effect this Friday, August 1. 'There is already a signal of an interest in talking', Haddad said to journalists in Bras\u00edlia. He mentioned a new phone conversation that took place on Monday between Vice President and Minister of Development, Industry, Commerce and Services Geraldo Alckmin and US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Later, Haddad added in an interview with CNN that the 'channels of communication are starting to be cleared' between Bras\u00edlia and Washington. 'We understand that, if we sit down with concrete data, with rationality, with the purpose of establishing a balanced relationship, we will reach an understanding', Haddad said. Trump justified the tariff threat against Brazil on the political argument that there is a supposed 'witch hunt' against former President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022), who is on trial in the Supreme Court (STF) for alleged attempted coup in 2022. As Brazil's second-largest trading partner, the United States has a trade surplus with the largest economy in Latin America. President Lula, who rejects any discussion about Bolsonaro's fate in the courts, had already shown himself open to dialogue with his American counterpart on Monday. On Tuesday, the Brazilian leader again requested the opening of negotiations with Washington during an official event in the state of Rio de Janeiro. 'Is there a disagreement? Sit down, put the disagreement aside and let's try to resolve it', he said. 'We don't want a fight, we want to negotiate.

Trump had threatened the tariff in a letter published on his Truth Social platform, linking it to what he described as a 'witch hunt' against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, a close ally of Trump, is facing a trial in Brazil for allegedly attempting to overthrow Lula after his presidential victory in 2022. Lula said that Trump's threats broke with protocol and that the fate of his predecessor should not be part of trade negotiations. 'The judiciary in Brazil is independent. The President of the Republic has no influence,' he said, adding that Bolsonaro 'is not being judged personally. He is being judged for the acts he tried to organize a coup.' Lula also expressed his disappointment with Trump's posturing, saying that he initially thought the news was fake. 'It was very unpleasant,' he said. 'I thought it was fake news.' Brazil has promised reciprocal tariffs if Trump follows through on his threat, marking the first time in months that another country has pushed back against Trump.

Trump linked the possible trade agreement to the treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently on trial for allegedly attempting a coup after his 2022 election loss to Lula. Trump called Bolsonaro 'a respected leader worldwide' and demanded an end to what he described as a 'witch hunt.' Lula reacted sharply on the social platform X: 'Brazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions and accepts no interference.' He emphasized that any unilateral tariff increase by the US will be met with equal tariffs on American goods. Lula also disputed Trump's claim that the US has a trade deficit with Brazil, citing official US figures showing a trade surplus of $7.4 billion in 2024. The proposed tariff increase, from the current average of 10% to 50%, could significantly affect the Brazilian economy, which imports oil, iron, and coffee from the US, while exporting planes, machines, and fuels to the US.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 10:11 PM\nSource:[www.starnieuws.com](https://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/87301)\n\n**US and Brazil on Brink of Trade War Over Bolsonaro's Trial**\nThe United States and Brazil are on the brink of a trade war, with President Donald Trump threatening to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports. Trump's move is seen as a political gesture, aimed at helping his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing a trial for attempting a coup. Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has vowed to retaliate with tariffs on US imports. The dispute is the latest in a long saga involving Trump, Bolsonaro, and Lula, and shows how Trump uses tariffs to settle scores with his political enemies. Trump's threat comes after he wrote a letter to Lula, saying 'This trial should not be taking place. It's a witch hunt that must end IMMEDIATELY!' Trump also claimed that Brazil was violating the freedom of expression of Americans, and ordered an investigation into Brazilian practices. However, the US has a trade surplus with Brazil, with $7.4 billion in exports last year. Brazil is considering imposing tariffs on specific US products, according to a high-ranking official. The dispute could lead to higher coffee prices in the US, as Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and the US is its largest customer. The case against Bolsonaro involves allegations of a vast conspiracy to cling to power after losing the 2022 presidential election, including a plan to annul the vote and a plot to assassinate Lula. Bolsonaro has denied any involvement, but admitted to studying alternative ways to stay in power. The trial is expected to begin next month, and if Bolsonaro is found guilty, he could face years in prison. Lula has said that Brazil will not drop the charges, and is instead seeking diplomatic support from the international community.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/es/2025/07/11/espanol/america-latina/trump-bolsonaro-brasil-aranceles.html)\n\n**5 takeaways on Trump's tariff tussle with Brazil**\nPresident Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on imports from Brazil if the country does not drop its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Lula has vowed to retaliate if the U.S. goes ahead with the tariff, which Trump said will start on August 1. Brazil is a significant supplier of coffee to the U.S., accounting for about $2.4 billion in imports between May 2024 and April 2025. Coffee prices surged on Thursday after Trump's tariff announcement. Trump and Bolsonaro have a close relationship, and Trump has compared Bolsonaro's legal challenges to his own stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.

According to Noticias Argentinas, the Brazilian government responded with a strong note, a double summons of the US charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Brasilia, and a threat of retaliatory commercial measures. Trump justified the tariffs not only for economic reasons, but also because he considers Bolsonaro to be a victim of a 'witch hunt', referring to the accusations of a coup plot after his 2022 electoral defeat. 'This trial should not be happening. It's a witch hunt that must end immediately!' exclaimed the Republican. Trump also questioned the Brazilian judiciary's restrictions on profiles that disinform about institutions and warned Lula: 'If you decide to increase your tariffs, they will be added to the 50% we will apply.' Lula responded: 'Brazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions and will not be tutored by anyone.' He also called the tariffs 'offensive' and announced that if they are implemented, Brazil will apply the economic reciprocity law to suspend bilateral agreements. The Brazilian Foreign Ministry summoned the US charg\u00e9 d'affaires twice in the day to protest the letter and a previous statement by the embassy in defense of Bolsonaro, considering the interventions in internal affairs 'unacceptable' and returning the letter to the US. The dispute has significant commercial implications: in 2024, Brazil exported products to the US worth $40.368 billion, including oil, coffee, steel, cellulose, and aircraft. Brazilian businessmen asked both governments to sit down to negotiate to avoid greater damage. Trump hardened the tariff offensive, in addition to Brazilian products, he announced a 50% tariff on copper, in effect since August 1, and threatened tariffs of 200% on pharmaceuticals that do not install in the US, fueling international tensions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[Diario El Liberal](https://www.elliberal.com.ar/nota/52500/2025/07/explosiva-guerra-entre-trump-y-lula-para-salvar-a--bolsonaro--suba-de-aranceles-y-rechazo-de-brasil)\n\n**Trump Threatens 50% Tariff on Brazilian Exports and Attacks Brazilian Supreme Court**\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports to the US and has also attacked the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) for its handling of former President Jair Bolsonaro's trial for a 2022 coup attempt. Trump's letter to Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva claims that Bolsonaro is being treated unfairly and that the trial is a 'witch hunt' that should be stopped immediately. Trump also accuses the STF of violating 'the freedom of expression of Americans' and claims that the court has issued 'hundreds of secret and illegal censorship orders' to US social media platforms. Trump announces that the US will impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian exports starting from August 1, 2025, and claims that the current trade relationship between the two countries is 'unfair' and 'unreciprocal'. The Brazilian government and various business associations have reacted strongly to the threat, calling for diplomatic intervention to resolve the crisis.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 06:55 AM\nSource:[Correio Braziliense](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/politica/2025/07/7196359-trump-ataca-o-brasil-com-tarifa-de-50-e-pressao-ao-stf-por-bolsonaro.html)\n\n**Trump Threatens Brazil with 50% Tariffs Over 'Witch Hunt' Against Bolsonaro**\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% import tariff on Brazil starting from August 1. He made this announcement in a letter to the Brazilian government, citing the treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently on trial for plotting a coup in 2023. Trump referred to this as a 'witch hunt'. In response, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva stated on social media that an increase in import tariffs would be met with a suspension of trade agreements between the two countries. He also mentioned that the US has been exporting more to Brazil than importing from it for years. Trump had previously threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on BRICS countries. The proposed tariffs and Brazil's countermeasures could have severe consequences for food prices in the US, as a third of the country's coffee comes from Brazil, as do over 50% of its orange juice and significant amounts of sugar, ethanol, and beef. On the other hand, Brazilian businesses will also face significant consequences, with the Brazilian real already dropping 2% in value immediately after Trump's announcement. The stocks of Embraer, a Brazilian aircraft manufacturer, and Petrobras, a Brazilian oil giant, also plummeted on the US stock exchange.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 05:05 AM\nSource:[Gazet van Antwerpen](https://www.gva.be/buitenland/trump-dreigt-met-enorme-heffingen-tegen-brazilie-vanwege-heksenjacht-op-ex-president/76889300.html)\n\n**Trump Threatens 50% Tariff on Brazil Amid 'Witch Hunt' Accusations**\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian products, citing a 'witch hunt' against former President Jair Bolsonaro, his ally, who is accused of conspiring to stage a coup in Brazil. Trump wrote in a letter to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, 'This trial should not be held. It's a witch hunt that must end IMMEDIATELY!' Lula responded, 'Any unilateral tariff increase will be addressed in accordance with Brazil's Economic Reciprocity Law.' He added, 'Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any kind of tutelage.' Trump justified his decision, saying that the US-Brazil trade relationship has been 'far from reciprocal' and that '50% is much less than what we need to achieve the equal conditions we must have with your country.' He warned that if Brazil responds with reciprocal tariffs, taxes will increase another 50%. However, he also left open the possibility of negotiating for Brazil to open its market to the US without tariffs and achieve a balance in trade. The 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports will take effect from August 1. The US is Brazil's second-largest trading partner, after China. Historically, the trade balance has been favorable to the US, with a surplus of $43 billion over the past 10 years, according to the US Chamber of Commerce for Brazil. Trump and Bolsonaro coincided as presidents in Trump's first term in the White House and developed a political affinity that has remained until now. Both were accused in their countries of trying to stay in power after losing their immediate re-election. However, unlike Trump, who was able to participate and win in the US elections in 2024, Bolsonaro has been banned by the Brazilian justice system from running for public office until 2030 for abuse of political power. Trump suggested on Monday that the 'only trial' that should be held is in the polls. In his letter to Lula, Trump also stated that in Brazil, there has been an 'attack on the freedom of expression of Americans' due to the Supreme Court's orders against social media platforms 'threatening them with multimillion-dollar fines and expulsion from the Brazilian market.' Lula responded in detail to Trump's claims, saying that 'judicial processes against those responsible for the coup plot are the exclusive competence of the Brazilian Judiciary.' Therefore, 'they are not subject to any interference or threat that could compromise the independence of national institutions.' In reference to Bolsonaro's social media posts, Lula added that Brazilian society 'rejects the content of hate, racism, child pornography, scams, fraud, and speeches that attack human rights and democratic freedoms.' The Brazilian president warned that 'freedom of expression should not be confused with aggression or violent practices.' Regarding bilateral economic relations, he assured that companies, whether national or foreign, must comply with Brazilian legislation to operate in the country. Lula said it is 'inaccurate' to say that there is a US trade deficit in its commercial relationship with Brazil, given that US government statistics show a surplus of $410 billion in trade in goods and services with Brazil over the past 15 years.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[diariodeloeste.com.ar](http://www.diariodeloeste.com.ar/trump-amenaza-a-brasil-con-un-nuevo-arancel-del-50/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasts\u2014across domains from international trade, macroeconomics, political science, and Latin American studies\u2014converge on a strong consensus: it is highly unlikely that US imports from Brazil in November 2025 will exceed those of November 2024 ($3.98B), following the imposition of sweeping 50% US tariffs on most Brazilian goods effective August 2025. Experts draw on historical precedents (e.g., US-China trade war), base rates, and their analyses of how abrupt tariff shocks produce immediate and severe drops in targeted bilateral trade flows\u2014typically by 15-40% within 1-3 months\u2014overwhelming normal year-on-year growth trends.\n\nKey factors cited that decrease the probability include:\n- The magnitude and breadth of the tariffs, targeting roughly 60% of bilateral trade and covering key sectors like sugar and coffee, causing price shocks and incentivizing US importers to substitute suppliers or cut orders.\n- Only partial exemptions (circa 700 products, often industrial, with major agricultural products largely included in the tariff scope) provide limited offset; sectoral dependencies such as oil and aircraft may sustain some volume but aren't enough to compensate for sharp declines elsewhere.\n- Political escalation, with US and Brazilian retaliatory threats, increases overall trade uncertainty and depresses bilateral flows.\n- Stockpiling and anticipatory buying by US firms ahead of the tariff likely front-loaded trade, further reducing expected November demand.\n\nMitigating factors, which slightly increase probabilities, include:\n- Some key US supply chain needs (e.g., cane sugar, following Coca-Cola's switch) may preserve limited trade flows in select commodities, if exemptions occur.\n- Both governments show public willingness to negotiate, and diplomatic talks are underway, but no breakthrough or rollback is in effect as of late September. Experts judge it unlikely that a deal or carve-out will be reached or take effect in time for November data, given commercial and shipping lead times.\n- A small chance remains for a rapid, face-saving interim agreement or an unexpected surge in exempted products, but this is seen as a tail risk rather than a base case.\n\nGroup estimates for the probability that US imports from Brazil in November 2025 exceed November 2024 range from 13% to 30%, with a median near 18-19%. All analysts anchor their reasoning in both the base rate of post-tariff import drops in past trade conflicts and the absence (at forecast time) of meaningful tariff suspension or broad exemptions. The dominant scenario is substantial contraction in November 2025 US imports from Brazil compared to the prior year, with only a modest possibility that negotiations or exemptions lift imports above the 2024 benchmark.",
