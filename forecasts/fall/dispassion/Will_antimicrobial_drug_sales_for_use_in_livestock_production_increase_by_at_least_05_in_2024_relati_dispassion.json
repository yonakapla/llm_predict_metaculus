Market data shows overall growth in farm animal drug sales, but this is driven by both the companion and food-animal sectors, and by both antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial products.\n\nHowever, 2024 saw a sharp uptick in animal disease outbreaks (specifically avian influenza), which can pressure producers and veterinarians to use more antimicrobials temporarily, especially for secondary infections. While overall production incentives (livestock population, meat demand) seem relatively stable with no sudden herd expansion, disease dynamics can produce volatility.\n\nOn balance: the probability of at least a 0.5% increase is higher than for a >2% jump, but the bar for this question is low. Even a mild, reactive uptick in antimicrobial use\u2014due to outbreaks or a slight uptick in livestock inventory\u2014could be sufficient. Yet, the inertia of regulatory controls, veterinary oversight, and decade-long stewardship successes make a major rise unlikely unless 2024 disease events proved especially acute in driving sales.\n\nGiven this, I estimate the chance of a 0.5% or greater increase in 2024 antimicrobial sales for livestock in the U.S. at 32%. This reflects the base rate of sales stability/decrease, tempered by significant but not unprecedented disease challenges in 2024. Probability stays slightly below one-third, as the status quo is heavily weighted toward stability or decrease, but current year noise (outbreaks, possible underestimation of animal sector response) prevents an even lower figure.",

While animal health drug and anti-infective markets are growing globally, those market reports largely reflect human healthcare and veterinary contexts globally, and not the specific FDA metric of medically important antimicrobials for US food animals. The news highlights a surge in animal disease risk and global AMR threat, but these are extensively countered by enhanced vaccination and biosecurity, as prompted by the Woah/OIE and FDA. Outbreaks (e.g., rising avian influenza cases) could prompt local increases but are not of sufficient national magnitude (as of September 2025) to overwhelm the flattening trend. Most significantly, the 0.5% increase threshold is a low bar, but given historical inertia and the lack of transformative negative shocks, the status quo outcome remains most probable.

However, the doubling of global avian influenza and rising animal disease outrbreaks introduce some tail risk (a small chance of a short-term uptick). There is no evidence of a regulatory rollback or major surge in animal numbers in the US, nor is there reporting of a crisis that would strongly push antibiotic usage higher. With these considerations\u2014and the generally sticky nature of status quo policy and behavior\u2014the probability of a \u22650.5% increase is low, but not vanishingly so: there is always a risk of a small data fluctuation, small undocumented surges due to production or prophylactic use after outbreaks, or a brief industry reaction to supply uncertainties.

From my IMS data perspective, nearly all recent annual changes in this dataset have not exceeded the \u00b12% band, with no persistent upward shocks, and even modest bounces have typically followed unique external triggers\u2014none of which are reported for 2024. You place weight on disease outbreak response (e.g., avian influenza) possibly resulting in increased sales, but the historical US pattern is to address such crises via mass culling and biosecurity, not widespread antimicrobial prophylaxis. Further, most stewardship systems now tightly control veterinary prescribing during outbreaks. Therefore, a jump exceeding the +0.5% threshold remains possible, but the inertia of structural stewardship, flat-to-declining herd sizes, and the absence of a regulatory reversal or reporting anomaly argues for a much lower probability. I would suggest that your estimate does not sufficiently discount the strength of institutional and data-driven inertia, and thus markedly overstates the risk of a meaningful uptick."

We agree that the public health and regulatory environment places strong downward pressure on antimicrobial use and that, barring a major, well-documented epidemiologic shock, the US livestock sector would likely continue on its recent plateau-to-slight-decline trajectory. By assigning an 18% probability, you appropriately signal that the largest weight belongs on the status quo, but you remain empirically honest about yearly noise and tail risk, both of which are part of any grounded market forecast.

As an expert in Animal Health Policy and World Organisation for Animal Health guidelines, I emphasize that the US response to acute livestock disease outbreaks (e.g., avian influenza) has most often relied on depopulation, movement restrictions, and heightened biosecurity rather than a notable rise in broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Stewardship pressure from regulators and market actors further constrains the chance that veterinary practitioners would resort to additional antimicrobial usage at a scale sufficient to move the national FDA metric above the 0.5% threshold. Additionally, the livestock inventory in 2024, particularly cattle, has not increased, which would be the most plausible structural driver of increased sales. Finally, outbreak-derived spikes in antimicrobial sales tend to be short-lived and sector-specific, rarely sufficient to register a national uptick. In short, your probability underestimates the inertia created by the strong stewardship and biosecurity framework, places too much weight on outbreak risk, and does not discount the regulatory and herd/flock-size context that constrains upward movement in the time frame relevant to this forecast."

From the EU livestock regulation perspective, regulatory response to such outbreaks in the US mirrors recent European experience, where interventions skew toward depopulation, strict movement controls, and enhanced hygiene\u2014not toward expanding use of medically important antibiotics. The established framework of voluntary and mandatory stewardship, plus the political and economic costs associated with even a modest uptick in antibiotic use, create substantial inertia against changes that would breach the 0.5% threshold. The US regulatory climate and heightened cross-sectoral AMR focus have proved resilient, resisting even moderate shocks. Additionally, there is scant evidence from 2024 of herd expansion or policy shifts that would support any deer-in-the-headlights surge in drug sales.

Fluctuations in the market might theoretically enable a marginal rise, but as you observe, these rarely move the needle enough to impact the sum of medically important antimicrobials at the national scale.

Further, your analysis appreciates that both market analytics and regulatory trends support status quo or continued mild reduction, and that nothing in current disease epidemiology or economic indicators suggests a shock large enough to cross the 0.5% national increase threshold. By weighting the base rate heavily and reserving allowance primarily for random fluctuations or the possibility of local noise, your probability reflects both the structural inertia of the system and the minor role of tail risks.

Your 23% probability reasonably reflects a modest tail risk due to the uptick in reported animal disease outbreaks (notably avian influenza), but importantly, you ground your estimate in the structural persistence of stewardship and biosecurity measures, which have succeeded in capping sharp year-to-year variance in FDA-reported data. You further show a nuanced appreciation for the fact that, barring unexpected sectoral shocks with policy impact, the status quo of 'flat-to-slightly down' is highly sticky in this domain.

The report cites a 2025\u20112032 CAGR of 6.7% and a 2025 market size of US$ 4,830.7\u202fmillion, with a 2032 projection of US$ 7,620.1\u202fmillion.  It attributes the expansion to rising hospital\u2011acquired infections (HAIs), the prevalence of multidrug\u2011resistant organisms such as MRSA and CRE, and advances in molecular diagnostics, including PCR, next\u2011generation sequencing (NGS) and AI\u2011powered tools.  The release notes that the World Health Organization estimates that AMR could cause 10\u202fmillion deaths annually by 2050 if left unchecked, underscoring the urgency of diagnostic innovation.  Key drivers highlighted include the adoption of rapid, point\u2011of\u2011care (PoC) testing and the integration of AI and bioinformatics to accelerate detection.  Restraints identified are the limited availability of new antibiotics and the continued reliance on empirical therapy, which can dampen the uptake of diagnostic tools.  Opportunities focus on AI integration, PoC deployment in resource\u2011limited settings, and antimicrobial stewardship programs.  Regionally, North America is positioned as the market leader due to advanced infrastructure and regulatory support, while Europe, Asia\u2011Pacific, and the Middle East are projected to experience significant growth driven by regulatory mandates and rising infection burdens.  The report lists major players such as Abbott Laboratories, Bio\u2011Rad Laboratories, Thermo Fisher Scientific, BD, Roche, and bioM\u00e9rieux, and cites recent developments like bioM\u00e9rieux\u2019s FDA clearance of the VITEK\u00ae COMPACT PRO system in March\u202f2025.  Overall, the release frames the AMR diagnostics market as a high\u2011growth sector driven by technological progress and a global health imperative.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[openPR.com - Open Public Relations Free of Charge](https://www.openpr.com/news/4183698/antimicrobial-resistance-diagnostics-market-to-expand-at-6-7)\n\n**As antibiotics turn ineffective against deadly superbugs, ICMR wants curbs on their sale**\nThe ICMR\u2011funded paper recommends that new, high\u2011generation antibiotics be sold only in hospitals that have antimicrobial stewardship, infection\u2011prevention and control standards, and that they be used only for very sick patients.  Dr Kamini Walia, ICMR\u2019s AMR programme officer, told ThePrint, 'Our suggestions are for high\u2011generation antibiotic reserved for very sick patients and can be used only in hospital settings.'  The authors argue that changes can be effected through amendments to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act & Rules.  A survey of doctors in tertiary care hospitals found that most prescribe antibiotics responsibly, yet misuse, abuse and over\u2011the\u2011counter sales continue to drive AMR.  In 2019, between 3 and 10.4\u202flakh people died in India from bacterial AMR, according to the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project.  The paper notes that over the past decade, all newly introduced antimicrobials failed to show improved effectiveness against multidrug\u2011resistant gram\u2011negative pathogens, underscoring the urgent need for new treatment options such as plazomicin, cefiderocol and novel \u03b2\u2011lactam combinations.  The GRAM report also reported 6,86,908 deaths linked to six major superbugs (E.\u202fcoli, K.\u202fpneumoniae, S.\u202faureus, A.\u202fbaumannii, M.\u202ftuberculosis, S.\u202fpneumoniae), with over 2.14\u202flakh attributable deaths.  Resistance data show K.\u202fpneumoniae has 62.3\u202f% resistance to carbapenem meropenem; E.\u202fcoli\u2019s susceptibility to imipenem fell from 81\u202f% in 2017 to 63\u202f% in 2023, and to piperacillin\u2011tazobactam from 56.8\u202f% to 42.4\u202f%.  K.\u202fpneumoniae isolates had only 26.5\u202f% susceptibility to piperacillin\u2011tazobactam in 2023.  Consequently, clinicians are increasingly prescribing polymyxins such as colistin, but rising colistin use is driving resistance to this last\u2011resort drug.  Since the 2011 National Policy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance, India has introduced Schedule\u202fH1 to restrict over\u2011the\u2011counter sales, launched a red\u2011line campaign on drug packages, and periodically revised the National List of Essential Medicines, though implementation challenges limit success.  The TB programme offers a model of robust stewardship: new TB drugs (bedaquiline, delamanid, pretomanid) are dispensed only through DOTS\u2011Plus centres, with diagnostics performed by accredited labs.  Dr Aravind\u202fR., head of infectious diseases at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, said, 'I think reserve category antibiotics should only be available in hospital formularies. Also, pharmaceutical companies should be barred from offering free samples of antibiotics to physicians as they end up with patients.'  WHO\u2019s AWaRe classification divides antibiotics into access, watch and reserve groups; a 2024 government report found that 57\u202f% of reserve antibiotics prescribed in India are those with high potential for resistance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/health/as-antibiotics-turn-ineffective-against-deadly-superbugs-icmr-wants-curbs-on-their-sale/2743741/)\n\n**Anticoccidial Drugs Market: Major Trends Reshaping the Future of the Industry**\nThe press release titled 'Anticoccidial Drugs Market: Major Trends Reshaping the Future of the Industry' reports that the global anticoccidial drugs market was valued at $1.27\u202fbillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.35\u202fbillion in 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% (source: article).

The research estimates that an improved pipeline of antimicrobics targeting Gram\u2011negative bacteria could save 11\u202fmillion lives by 2050. It examined annual revenue and volume data for two representative antibiotics\u2014cefiderocol and ceftazidime\u2011avibactam\u2014using sales figures from IQVIA (2015\u20112024). Three scenarios were modelled: low, intermediate and high, with the intermediate set at roughly US$363\u202fmillion per year per drug, adjusted for inflation. The study found that the G7\u2011EU27 bloc did not meet its medium\u2011term cumulative targets. The United Kingdom achieved its medium\u2011term goals through a subscription\u2011style \u2018pay\u2011for\u2011access\u2019 programme that guarantees a fixed annual payment to manufacturers regardless of sales volume.

It is here, it is growing, and it could soon become one of the biggest killers in the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has repeatedly warned that if nothing changes, resistant infections could kill more people globally than cancer by 2050. The danger is particularly acute in sub\u2011Saharan Africa, where drug regulation is weaker and antibiotics are used widely in both human health and agriculture.\n\nKenya is already facing this reality. The Ministry of Health has identified AMR as a national public health crisis, noting that common bacterial infections are becoming harder to treat with standard medicines. Doctors are increasingly reporting cases where antibiotics that used to work fail, necessitating the use of more expensive or less accessible drugs. The causes extend far beyond hospitals.\n\nOne of the major drivers of resistance is the way antibiotics are used in food\u2011producing animals. Research by the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership in Kenya has shown that about 80 per cent of livestock households regularly use antibiotics, and an astonishing 95 per cent obtain them without prescriptions.\n\nMany farmers use these drugs not just to treat illness but also to promote growth and prevent disease in healthy animals. Withdrawal periods, the mandatory time between treatment and slaughter, are often ignored, which means residues end up in meat sold to consumers. Studies show that although awareness of AMR among farmers is relatively high, with most able to correctly answer basic questions about it, this knowledge does not necessarily change behaviour.\n\nGlobally, organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) have sounded the alarm on the agricultural link to resistance. In Zimbabwe and Zambia, for instance, Farmer Field Schools supported by FAO have helped small\u2011scale poultry farmers improve hygiene and biosecurity, reducing their reliance on antibiotics.\n\nThese initiatives are part of the wider \u2018One Health\u2019 approach that recognises human, animal and environmental health as interconnected, and that tackling AMR requires coordinated action across all three.\n\nKenya has attempted to follow this path through its National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, launched in 2017 and now in its second phase. The plan committed the government to expand surveillance, strengthen regulation of drug use and improve public awareness.\n\nCounty\u2011level AMR committees have been set up to bring together the health, agriculture and environmental sectors. Yet experts warn that progress has been uneven, particularly in informal markets where much of the country\u2019s meat is sold. In these settings, regulation is weak, veterinary oversight is minimal, and consumers have little information about what they are eating.\n\nThis is where private sector practices can make a difference, even if they cannot replace public policy. Kenchic, Kenya\u2019s largest poultry processor, has adopted a farm\u2011to\u2011family traceability system that tracks meat back through breeder farms and hatcheries.\n\nThe company is the only African organisation recognised by the International Poultry Council for antimicrobial stewardship, and it holds FSSC\u202f22000 food safety certification. Products are tested regularly for microbial contamination, and customer complaints are resolved within two days.\n\n'We are highly regulated in terms of antibiotic use,' says Brenda Njeri, the company\u2019s Factory Manager. 'The measures we have in place are designed to ensure our products are antimicrobial free.' She adds that Kenchic can trace any chicken cut back to the grandparent flock it came from, giving consumers confidence about safety and origin.\n\nNjeri also emphasises the role of consumers in shaping the food system. 'Please, ask what you eat. What you eat makes you who you are. Health is key to sustainability, so whatever we offer the society must also keep it healthy.'\n\nAlun Meskel, Head of Plant Operations, is more direct about the risks elsewhere in the industry.\n\n'A good number of farmers focus so much on profitability, they pump chicken with antibiotics to prevent them from getting sick,' he says. 'By the time the chicken is slaughtered, you are buying meat that has traces of antibiotics in it. And when people fall ill, the medication they take may no longer work because they've unknowingly built resistance over time.'\n\nMeskel explains that Kenchic\u2019s long\u2011term goal is to reach antibiotic\u2011free production, a standard that only a handful of organisations worldwide are pursuing. 'Our ultimate goal is to have antibiotic\u2011free production. It is a very ambitious project, but it is the only way forward,' he says.\n\nBoth managers stress that animal welfare is closely tied to food safety. Birds are raised without cages, allowed to walk freely, and even given perches and toys to simulate a natural environment. 'When animals are stressed during transport or slaughter, the meat quality is affected. Relaxed animals produce safer and better food,' Meskel notes.\n\nHe also points out that chicken is not only affordable but one of the healthiest proteins available. 'Gram for gram, chicken has the highest protein and the least fat. It is good for you and can be eaten every day,' he says.\n\nThese insights highlight the gap between best practice and the broader market. While a company like Kenchic may offer consumers assurances, the reality is that most Kenyans still buy their meat from informal traders who lack such systems. Without stronger regulation, routine monitoring and clearer labelling, the public remains exposed to hidden risks.\n\nThe danger is not just theoretical. Resistant bacteria do not stay confined to farms, they can spread through food, water and the environment, undermining the effectiveness of antibiotics when people need them most. The Ministry of Health warns that the cost of inaction will be measured not only in money but in lives lost.\n\nIn the meantime, every plate of meat carries an unspoken question: what is really in it, and what might it mean for our health tomorrow.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 24, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[Standard Digital News - Kenya](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001527679/antibiotic-epidemic-how-meat-is-making-our-medicines-useless)\n\n**Japan Colistin Sulphate Market Strategies to Maximize Growth and Profitability, Forecast 2025 to 2032**\nThe Colistin Sulphate market is expected to grow significantly, driven by its critical role in combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, particularly in the animal health sector.

The report highlights the increasing risks to human health, with the number of outbreaks of avian influenza in mammals more than doubling in 2024, from 459 to 1,022 in 55 countries. Almost half of the animal diseases reported over the past 18 years have the potential to be transmitted to humans. Emmanuelle Soubeyran, Woah's director-general, stated, 'The spread, prevalence, and impact of animal diseases are changing rapidly, posing new and complex challenges not only for animal health, but also for agriculture, food safety, public health, and the protection of natural ecosystems.' The report also notes the resurgence of diseases considered endemic in specific regions in entirely new areas, such as the reappearance of the sheep and goat plague in Europe and the spread of the African swine fever to Sri Lanka. The report identifies climate change and the intensification of global trade as key drivers of this new geography of animal diseases. 'Prevention remains the most effective tool,' the report emphasizes, highlighting the unequal access to vaccines for livestock as a major criticism. Vaccination, along with sanitary and biosafety measures, is recommended as the key tool to prevent epidemics, reduce antibiotic use, and combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance. The report also notes a 5% decrease in the use of antibiotics in animals between 2020 and 2022, with the EU leading the trend (-23%), followed by Africa (-20%). However, one in five countries continues to use antibiotics as growth promoters, a practice strongly discouraged by Woah.

The report warns that the risk of the virus spreading to humans has increased. According to the report, there were 1,022 animal influenza outbreaks in 55 countries in 2024, up from 459 in 2023. While the risk of human infection remains low, the virus has become more adaptable to spreading between animals, increasing the likelihood of transmission to humans. The report notes that nearly half of the animal diseases reported to the OIE between 2005 and 2023 are considered to pose a threat to human health due to their zoonotic potential. This is attributed to climate change and increased animal trade. The report emphasizes the importance of preventing animal diseases in reducing antibiotic use and combating antimicrobial resistance. If no action is taken, the report predicts that antimicrobial resistance could lead to significant losses in livestock, threatening the food security of 2 billion people and causing up to $10 trillion in economic losses by 2050. The OIE is urging countries to invest in strengthening their national veterinary services, improving global and regional coordination, and enhancing animal disease monitoring systems.

As pet owners become more aware of the long-term health implications and necessary care for their pets, the demand for veterinary medicine in the country is further anticipated to increase. The Animal Health and Welfare Pathway, launched in 2023, aims to enhance farm animal health and welfare in the UK through collaboration among farmers, veterinarians, and the industry. This initiative is part of the Agricultural Transition Plan, focusing on improving biosecurity, tackling antimicrobial resistance, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. The pathway also aims to stimulate market demand for higher welfare products by improving transparency and ensuring fair pricing for farmers. Furthermore, zoonotic diseases, which can be transmitted from animals to humans, have gained significant attention due to their potential impact on public health, driving pet owners and livestock farmers to seek preventive care and vaccinations for their animals, thereby boosting the demand for veterinary medication.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 08:03 AM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/22/3086342/28124/en/UK-Veterinary-Medicine-Market-Trends-Analysis-and-Growth-Forecasts-Report-2025-2030-Pet-and-Livestock-Health-Initiatives-Preventive-Care-and-Vaccinations-Spur-Surge-in-Demand.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the consensus is that a 0.5% or greater increase in antimicrobial drug sales for US livestock in 2024 is unlikely, though not impossible. Base rates since 2017 show either stable or slightly declining sales, with the last reported figure (2023) marking a 2% decrease. Regulatory and stewardship pressures\u2014driven by the FDA, consumer preferences, and global health initiatives\u2014are seen as strong downward forces, supported by stable or shrinking livestock inventories and increased adoption of vaccines, diagnostics, and non-antimicrobial disease management. Most experts highlight that while disease outbreaks (notably the surge in avian influenza in 2024) could cause short-term, localized upticks in antibiotic use, these are typically offset by response strategies like culling and biosecurity rather than mass antibiotic application. Growth in the broader farm animal pharmaceutical market is largely attributed to increases outside the US and in non-antibiotic products. A few forecasters note that minor reporting quirks or unexpected supply chain or disease shocks could push sales above the threshold, but emphasize that these represent tail risks against a strong structural status quo. Expert forecasts range from 7% to 32%, with most clustering between 11% and 23% probability for a \u22650.5% sales increase. The modal and median view is that continued stewardship, regulatory inertia, and largely flat livestock production will keep 2024 antimicrobial sales at or below 2023 levels, with only a small chance of a reversal driven by unforeseen shocks.",
