The original question opened on 2024-02-25 02:58:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/19878). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n#### From the [ Humanoid robot Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot)\n\nA humanoid robot is a robot resembling the human body in shape. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body, for example, from the waist up. Some humanoid robots also have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as eyes and mouths. Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble humans.\n\n![Chinese robots](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/03/48249435-6ad4-4b8a-bd02-c43ede74bce4_55bf4566.jpg?itok=cYZpFgtd&v=1699004362)\n\n\n####Current progress\n\nBy 2025, China aims to establish an initial humanoid robot innovation system, achieving breakthroughs in crucial components such as \u201cbrains, cerebellum, and limbs,\u201d while ensuring a safe and efficient supply of core components. The production level for these robots is expected to reach an advanced international standard, with mass production occurring. These robots are anticipated to demonstrate their effectiveness across various fields, from manufacturing to livelihood services.\n\nAmong China's most advanced projects are those by Xiaomi and Fourier Intelligence. Xiaomi is working on its CyberOne, a robot that is supposed to be capable not only of perceiving space in 3D, but also of recognising individuals and interpreting their gestures, expressions and emotions. Combined with artificial intelligence, it could one day interact directly with humans. For its part, Fourier Intelligence is preparing to launch its first humanoid robot, the GR-1, specialised in medical actions, capable of moving at 5 km/h and carrying loads of several dozen kilogrammes. Its first deliveries are scheduled for 2024.\n\n####For more details on China's progress see:\n\n* https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/china-ministry-pushes-for-humanoid-robot-mass-production-by-2025-and-100-billion-market-by-2030.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\n* https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2023/11/09/china-aims-to-mass-produce-humanoid-robots-by-2027\n* https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3240259/china-says-humanoid-robots-are-new-engine-growth-pushes-mass-production-2025-and-world-leadership\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":19878,\"question_id\":19878}}`",

China's upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan (starting 2026) is expected to prioritize artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor self-reliance, smart manufacturing, supply chain and energy security, with 'new quality production forces' as a central concept. This initiative aims to address challenges from population decline by advancing automation and high-efficiency production, including the integration of humanoid robots beyond mere smart manufacturing. China aims to establish a core technology and component innovation system for humanoids by 2025 and is rapidly advancing in hardware mass production and cost optimization, while also pursuing brain-computer interface technology and developing supercomputers at primate-level cognitive capacity. Humanoids are increasingly seen as solutions not only for declining labor forces in manufacturing but also for caregiving shortages due to rapid aging and high-risk public service tasks. South Korea is also actively preparing, with the government, major corporations, and universities forming the 'K-Humanoid Alliance' in 2025. The country is establishing dedicated R&D centers, building domestic and international academic partnerships, and developing a full-cycle system from research to production and deployment, aiming for mass production and large-scale deployment by 2028\u20132029 to establish an independent humanoid technology ecosystem and gain global market leadership. Humanoids represent the convergence of AI, robotics, semiconductors, and battery technologies, making them pivotal in future national competitiveness.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 08:32 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025102134811)\n\n**L\u00fc Peng of Horizon Robotics: Advancing 'Human-like' Autonomous Driving to Achieve Full-Scale L4 by 2030**\nAt the 2025 World Intelligent Connected Vehicles Conference, L\u00fc Peng of Horizon Robotics emphasized that 'human-like' driving behavior\u2014resembling that of an experienced driver\u2014is essential for achieving 'usability' in intelligent driving systems, stating that both physical and psychological safety are critical. He argued that inconsistent or unpredictable driving actions disrupt not only the driver but also surrounding traffic. L\u00fc predicted that L4-level autonomous driving could be achieved by 2030, with L3 deployment possible by 2028 based on L4 capabilities. While urban assisted driving has expanded from premium vehicles to models priced as low as 150,000 RMB, it has not yet reached 'usable' standards due to persistent challenges in consistency, safety, and cost. L\u00fc stressed that current systems still require human intervention every 600\u20131,000 km on highways, far short of the 'near-million-kilometer' reliability required for L3. To bridge this gap, Horizon Robotics advocates for a 'Scale Up and Scale Out' strategy: leveraging L2-level mass production to generate real-world data, which fuels iterative improvements toward L4. This data-driven approach enables the definition of clear Operational Design Domains (ODD), such as 'all Beijing ring roads and national highways under all weather conditions,' allowing safe L3 activation. Horizon\u2019s next-generation L2 system uses end-to-end and reinforcement learning to mimic human driving behavior, achieving scene-agnostic operation, smooth control, and strong defensive driving capabilities. These features enhance psychological safety by reducing jerky braking, minimizing steering jitter, and enabling naturalistic responses in complex traffic scenarios. L\u00fc concluded that intelligent driving is entering a pivotal phase akin to the 4G era for smartphones, and once standardized, it will unlock broader innovation in smart cockpits and intelligent spaces. He urged both ambition and caution, given the safety-critical nature of the technology.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_6248544856_174713a58020026nkq.html)\n\n**YuShu Unveils 180cm Humanoid Robot H2: Capable of Ballet and Martial Arts, Resembles Sci-Fi Icons**\nYuShu Robotics unveiled its fourth humanoid robot, the H2, standing 180cm tall and weighing approximately 70kg\u2014marking a significant increase from the H1 model's 47kg. The H2 features 31 joints (12 in the arms, 14 in the legs, 3 in the torso, and 2 undisclosed functional joints), a 19% improvement over the R1's 26 joints. This enhanced joint count, combined with advanced balance and motion control algorithms, enables fluid, human-like movements. The robot demonstrates advanced capabilities including performing ballet with graceful hand and foot movements, executing martial arts routines with precision, walking, running, and even walking alongside humans in a fashion show. Its facial design has drawn comparisons to the robots in the film 'I, Robot' and the TV series 'Westworld,' evoking themes of human-robot coexistence. The H2's design and performance suggest potential applications in industrial automation, hazardous environment tasks, and personalized companionship services. YuShu's product lineup includes the H1 (2023), G1 (2024), and R1 (2024), with the H2 representing a major leap in human-likeness and functionality.

Among the standout exhibits was the AstroDroid AD-01 robot by ELU Technology Group (formerly Youli Wuxian), developed in Hangzhou's West Lake Science and Technology Corridor. Designed to address the challenge of household chores and elderly care, the robot demonstrated advanced capabilities in precise visual perception, action control, and autonomous decision-making. Its core is the Hyper-VLA end-to-end multimodal large model, a 'brain' enabling real-world situational awareness. Unlike current smart appliances limited to single tasks, the AD-01 integrates vision, language, and motor control within a unified neural network, allowing it to adapt to complex environments and ambiguous commands\u2014such as handling a fragile, water-filled plastic cup with appropriate force. The robot features self-correction and error tolerance, turning reliability into a quantifiable capability. In testing, it has shown proficiency in cooking, cleaning, organizing, and caregiving. The robot's 'brain' evolves through continuous training: human operators guide its movements via teleoperation, while it learns object recognition (color, shape, weight, texture), gradually mastering tasks from delicate handling to lifting 10 kg. The robot\u2019s design is not strictly humanoid\u2014some versions use single arms or wheeled bases\u2014emphasizing functional adaptation over human likeness. According to ELU co-founder Liu Yang, the robot could enter homes within three years. The company\u2019s strategy centers on a 'one brain, multiple bodies, multiple scenarios' model, where a single AI system drives diverse physical forms across homes, factories, healthcare, and public spaces. This modular, scalable intelligence acts like a replicable 'operating system' for embodied AI. A recent 260 million RMB strategic partnership with Shihua Culture & Tourism Holding Group signals strong commercial momentum, indicating that robots capable of household chores and elder care are rapidly transitioning from concept to reality.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 05:41 AM\nSource:[\u676d\u5dde\u7f51](https://pic.hangzhou.com.cn/hzyx/content/content_9106990.html)\n\n**L\u00fc Peng of Horizon Robotics: Advancing 'Human-like' Autonomous Driving to Achieve Full-Scale L4 by 2030**\nAt the 2025 World Intelligent Connected Vehicles Conference, L\u00fc Peng of Horizon Robotics emphasized that 'human-like' driving behavior\u2014resembling that of an experienced driver\u2014is essential for achieving 'usability' in intelligent driving systems, stating that both physical and psychological safety are critical.

To bridge this gap, Horizon Robotics advocates for a 'Scale Up and Scale Out' strategy: leveraging L2-level mass production to generate real-world data, which fuels iterative improvements toward L4. This data-driven approach enables the definition of clear Operational Design Domains (ODD), such as 'all Beijing ring roads and national highways under all weather conditions,' allowing safe L3 activation. Horizon\u2019s next-generation L2 system uses end-to-end and reinforcement learning to mimic human driving behavior, achieving scene-agnostic operation, smooth control, and strong defensive driving capabilities. These features enhance psychological safety by reducing jerky braking, minimizing steering jitter, and enabling naturalistic responses in complex traffic scenarios. L\u00fc concluded that intelligent driving is entering a pivotal phase akin to the 4G era for smartphones, and once standardized, it will unlock broader innovation in smart cockpits and intelligent spaces. He urged both ambition and caution, given the safety-critical nature of the technology.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_6248544856_174713a58020026nkq.html)\n\n**YuShu Unveils 180cm Humanoid Robot H2: Capable of Ballet and Martial Arts, Resembles Sci-Fi Icons**\nYuShu Robotics unveiled its fourth humanoid robot, the H2, standing 180cm tall and weighing approximately 70kg\u2014marking a significant increase from the H1 model's 47kg.

Like humans, humanoid robots have a skeleton (robust, lightweight body), muscles (high-power-density actuators), hands and feet (dexterous hands/performance legs), a heart (battery), a brain (human-machine interaction), and a cerebellum (motion planning and control). Chen noted that while China's humanoid robot technology and industry have seen rapid development\u2014robots can now dance, communicate freely, perform basic actions, and even sell goods\u2014major hurdles remain before they can enter real-life applications. For instance, at the humanoid robot half-marathon in Yizhuang, Beijing, in April 2024, the completion rate was below 30%, with most robots struggling with unstable gaits and frequent falls. Chen emphasized that the primary weakness is the 'cerebellum,' particularly in motion stability, making it unsafe to deploy robots in high-risk environments such as high-voltage areas or hospital wards without supervision. He compared the core of humanoid robots to industrial mother machines in manufacturing, asserting that motion control is the fundamental layer, requiring advances in sensing and intelligent skin to enhance the precision and stability of hands and feet, especially in dynamic movement. Beyond walking and running, hand and facial movements are highly complex: human facial expressions and hand movements involve dozens of degrees of freedom, enabling nuanced expressions and fine motor tasks like embroidery or surgery\u2014significant challenges. Market forecasts predict 18 million humanoid robots globally by 2035 and a $5 trillion global market by 2050, with China expected to be the largest single market at around 30%. Chen affirmed that while the future of humanoid robots is promising, the path is challenging. Currently, over 50 humanoid robot-related enterprises operate in Wuhan and surrounding areas, covering whole machine R&D, core component manufacturing, multimodal large models, and training facilities. Of these, 13 companies are in the robot whole-machine supply chain, and 27 have product supply capabilities, with notable strengths in electronic skin, inertial sensors, and cerebellum models. Over 70% of these companies are located in Guanggu, including Haicun Technology, Huaweike, and Yuansheng Innovation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 08:38 AM\nSource:[\u79d1\u5b66\u7f51](https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2025/10/553261.shtm)\n\n**Humanoid Robotics Industry: Entering a New Era of Growth and Empowering Diverse Sectors**\nHumanoid robotics in China is experiencing rapid development, transitioning from technical validation to large-scale commercialization, particularly during the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holiday in October 2025. In Beijing's Wangfujing, Galaxy United's Galbot robot autonomously interacts with customers, retrieves products from shelves, and delivers them. At BYD's electric vehicle factory, UBTECH's Walker S robot efficiently transports 15 kg materials. In a Beijing nursing home, Fitrobot's GR-3 robot provides AI-powered medication reminders and fall detection. According to the '2025 Humanoid Robotics and Embodied Intelligence Industry Research Report,' the global embodied intelligence market is projected to reach 19.525 billion yuan by 2025, with China accounting for nearly half. Core advancements in embodied intelligence\u2014where AI enables physical robots to perceive, learn, and interact dynamically\u2014drive this transformation. The 'brain' (AI large models) handles perception and decision-making, while the 'cerebellum' (motion control algorithms) manages balance and coordination. China has made significant progress in unified end-to-end large models capable of fine manipulation with low-cost hardware, such as grasping irregular objects, folding clothes, and brewing drinks. In motion control, UBTECH\u2019s Walker and 'Tiangong' robots demonstrate stable bipedal walking and autonomous navigation. Breakthroughs in perception algorithms, servo motors, and reducers enhance dexterity, stability, and autonomy. In a car factory, Galbot performs autonomous quality inspection, sorting, and heavy lifting using vision-based path planning, overcoming traditional robot limitations tied to pre-set QR codes. Galaxy United\u2019s CEO Dr. Wang He states the company has built a billion-scale high-quality dataset, enabling cross-task generalization. In homes, 'Wukong' robots interact with children and adapt to emotional states. In Shanghai, exoskeleton robots assist stroke patients with personalized rehabilitation by analyzing muscle signals in real time. Experts like Zhong Xinlong of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology note that while humanoid robots are entering real-world applications, challenges remain in cost, reliability, and intelligence levels. Ke Zhen Dong of Leju Intelligence acknowledges high current prices due to component R&D costs, but predicts cost reductions with mass production, similar to early industrial robots.

According to the author, the industry must first address three major bottlenecks: technical breakthroughs, supply chain collaboration, and business model innovation. Firstly, humanoid robots need to transition from 'mechanical mimicry' to 'human-like evolution' in terms of technology. This requires breakthroughs in key components such as lightweight materials, biomimetic muscles, and spherical joints. Companies like Ubitus (Hangzhou) Intelligent Robot Co., Ltd. and Shengdeng Power Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing) have made progress in these areas. Secondly, the ecosystem needs to shift from 'single-point breakthroughs' to 'collaborative breakthroughs'. Humanoid robots are complex systems that require collaboration between multiple stakeholders to produce. The author suggests establishing a more collaborative development mechanism between manufacturers and core component suppliers to accelerate technological iteration and cost optimization. Thirdly, the business model needs to transition from 'capital accumulation' to 'cost control'. High costs are the biggest obstacle to mass production, and achieving a commercial closed loop requires precise positioning of application scenarios and reducing costs to a reasonable range. The author suggests adopting a dual-drive model of scale-down costs and technological iteration, similar to the new energy vehicle industry. This can be achieved through design optimization, supply chain management, and manufacturing process innovation. Additionally, exploring flexible business models such as leasing, service sharing, and functional module subscription can help reduce the initial cost barrier and accelerate market verification and feedback loops.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 14, 2025 02:25 AM\nSource:[\u5343\u9f99\u7f51](https://finance.qianlong.com/2025/0814/8538267.shtml)\n\n**From 'Mechanical Arm' to 'All-Rounder': The Silent Revolution in Robotics**\nThe 2025 World Robot Conference is witnessing a silent revolution in the field of robotics. Robots are transitioning from laboratory 'technological wonders' to factory floors, showcasing their capabilities in intelligent manufacturing, modern agriculture, and home services. The driving force behind this revolution is the breakthrough in large language models. The '\u5929\u5de5Ultra' robot, for example, completed a half-marathon in 2 hours and 40 minutes and 42 seconds, demonstrating its ability to adapt to complex environments. The exhibition features multiple '\u5929\u5de5' robots working together to complete complex tasks, such as power line maintenance, assembly line sorting, and quality inspection. This technological breakthrough is attributed to the construction of a complete 'perception -- decision -- execution' intelligent closed-loop system, which enables robots to understand their environment like humans and make real-time adjustments. According to Wang Tianmiao, honorary director of the Beijing Aerospace Automation Research Institute, 'the emergence of large language models in 2022, which can simulate human brains and possess generalization and transferability, has driven the development of humanoid robots.' The market prospects are promising, with 50 robot companies showcasing mature commercial solutions at the conference. According to a report released by PwC on April 3, the global humanoid robot market is expected to grow from $2.03 billion in 2024 to $13.25 billion in 2029, with a compound annual growth rate of 45.5%. In China, the industrialization process is accelerating. New Sun Industrial Robot's '\u673a\u5668\u624b' has achieved a precision of 0.02 millimeters and has been applied in mass production of advanced chips, providing a crucial support for breaking the 'lack of chips and lack of soul' bottleneck. This revolution has far-reaching implications beyond the technical level. Like the steam engine in the 18th century, which liberated human physical labor, the 21st-century embodiment of intelligence is liberating machine intelligence. The development of humanoid robots is not only a technological advancement but also a new exploration of human production power boundaries. As the world faces global challenges such as climate change and population aging, intelligent robots have shown unique value. However, it is also necessary to perfect relevant ethical norms and social governance systems simultaneously. The leading edge of robot technology means the competition for industrial voice, military security, and international rule-making power, becoming an important variable in reshaping global strategic power balances. China has elevated the development of robot industry to a national strategy and has published relevant policy documents, such as the '14th Five-Year Plan for Robot Industry Development' and the 'Guiding Opinions on the Development of Humanoid Robots.' China is driving the development of humanoid robots with a 'policy support + technology breakthrough + scene landing' multi-round driving mode, fully leveraging the advantages of the new-type national system, and building a highland of humanoid robot innovation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 12:48 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-08-13/doc-infkutxe7300295.shtml)\n\n**\u4f17\u64ce Unveils First Heavy-Duty Humanoid Robot T800 at 2025 World Robot Conference**\n\u4f17\u64ce, a Chinese robotics company, unveiled its first heavy-duty, full-size humanoid robot, T800, at the 2025 World Robot Conference in Beijing.

    "summary": "Across a diverse panel of experts in manufacturing, robotics, technology market analysis, industrial engineering, and China studies, forecasts converge on a moderately low probability that China will mass produce (>1,000 identical, fully autonomous, bipedal humanoid robots) by the end of 2025. Most experts, leveraging deep knowledge of supply chains, technical bottlenecks, Gartner Hype Cycle positioning, and historical base rates, agree that while China's government support and manufacturing ecosystem provide strong upward pressure, technical hurdles\u2014especially in reliable autonomy, motion control, dexterous manipulation, and standardized production\u2014remain significant and likely unaddressed at scale within the 2025 timeframe. While large orders, government contracts, and impressive pilot runs are reported, independently verified evidence of actual, qualifying mass production is, as of late October 2025, lacking. Announcements often conflate pilot runs, diverse robots, or pre-orders with true mass production and delivery. The strict resolution criteria (identical model, full autonomy, public evidence) further lower probabilities. A small upside risk remains: China's unique policy mobilization could drive a last-minute push or announcement, but such an outcome is unlikely due to persistent technical and production-readiness bottlenecks. Final probability estimates from experts cluster between 18% and 40%, with the majority landing between 23% and 35%, indicating consensus on a sub-50% but non-trivial chance of a 'Yes' outcome, and a clear lean toward 'No' barring a rapid, well-documented breakthrough.",
