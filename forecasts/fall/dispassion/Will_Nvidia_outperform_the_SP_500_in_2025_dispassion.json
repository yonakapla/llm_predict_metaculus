However, the base rate of mean reversion after extreme outperformance is high, and the risk of an AI bubble or even temporary growth deceleration is material. Valuation risk is significant: even if Nvidia meets expectations, the hurdle to further outperformance is high. News flow shows both bullish (institutional buying, ETF inflows, continued revenue growth) and bearish (bubble warnings, concentration risk, mean reversion) signals. Weighing all factors, and adjusting for the heavy weight that status quo/base rates deserve, the most probable outcome is that Nvidia underperforms the S&P 500, but the chance of continued outperformance is still material given the company's momentum and macro setup.

Unlike many prior tech cycles, the supply-demand imbalance for advanced AI semiconductors is far from being resolved, and Nvidia still has a multi-year technological lead and deep, sticky customer relationships. While mean reversion is a valid concern, the life cycle for this particular industry segment (AI accelerators, data center GPUs) is arguably still in its hyper-growth phase, not yet approaching maturity.

Additionally, the behavioral argument tends to overweight recent trends and underweight the base rate: most stocks, even in periods of mania, do not sustain outperformance at this scale.

            "response": "While the Technical Analysis forecaster appropriately notes the risk of mean reversion and recognizes technical warnings such as overextended momentum and rising volatility, their probability (65%) places perhaps too much emphasis on continued momentum and macro tailwinds. From a macroeconomic cycle theory perspective, technical momentum often persists late into cycles, but fundamental inflection points\u2014such as weakening macro data, shifting central bank policy, or sector rotation\u2014can override technical signals swiftly, especially for highly cyclical, high-beta stocks like Nvidia. Moreover, macro theory highlights that late-stage bull markets are prone to abrupt regime shifts, which technical indicators may not anticipate in time. The current environment, with elevated valuations, historic sector concentration, and growing macro tail risks, suggests that the technical setup could deteriorate quickly if macro conditions shift. Therefore, a probability in the mid-60s may understate the risk of a macro-driven reversal, which is acutely relevant for Nvidia given its cyclical exposure and the signs of speculative excess in AI-linked equities."

            "response": "While the semiconductor sector forecaster argues that Nvidia's AI accelerator segment remains in hyper-growth and that industry maturity is not yet a limiting factor, from an industry life cycle theory perspective, this assessment may underestimate the risk of a transition phase. Even if the core AI hardware market is growing rapidly, the broader technology adoption curve often brings increased competition, customer bargaining power, and the risk that expectations become decoupled from feasible execution, especially after multiple years of explosive growth. Barriers to entry in semiconductors are high, but customers like major cloud providers are investing in custom silicon, and regulatory or supply chain shocks can emerge abruptly at this stage. Furthermore, as a company approaches sector dominance, its own growth rate becomes constrained by the law of large numbers and the saturation of early adopters. Thus, while secular demand remains strong and Nvidia's technology lead is clear, the risk of a transition toward maturity\u2014and the associated increase in volatility and mean reversion probability\u2014should not be discounted. The sector perspective may therefore overstate the likelihood of continued outperformance, especially given the high baseline set by Nvidia's recent returns."

While some forecasters (especially those focused on technicals, behavioral finance, and EMH) assign higher probabilities due to momentum, flows, and macro tailwinds, the fundamental and factor-based perspectives highlight the historical rarity of persistent outperformance at this scale. The risk of a sharp reversal or even a soft landing for Nvidia\u2019s valuation is non-trivial, and the S&P 500\u2019s own performance is still likely to be robust.

However, sector specialists, technical analysts, and behavioral finance forecasters lean toward higher probabilities (63-67%), citing persistent momentum and the durability of the AI-driven demand cycle. The strongest critique of my original probability (40%) is that the AI semiconductor cycle may have more runway than a generic life cycle model would suggest; Nvidia's dominance and the magnitude of current inflows could plausibly push outperformance a bit further than historic base rates alone would grant. Nevertheless, the structural and statistical barriers remain, and the probability should not be pushed into the majority range.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe S\\&P 500 is a market cap weighted index of 500 of the largest companies in the United State stock market. These 500 companies [cover](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview) approximately 80% of the total stock market capitalization in the United States.\n\nIt is notoriously difficult for single stocks to beat the S\\&P 500 index.

Of the 503 stocks in the fund, 346 did worse than 24.9%, meaning 69% of stocks in the S\\&P underperformed the index. (See list at [Finviz](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111\\&f=idx_sp500).) Studies have shown that this is not unusual, and that over the long term the median individual stock underperforms a passive strategy of buying and holding an index fund.

According to the article, if investors contribute $100,000 initially and $625 monthly over 20 years, assuming the historical 8.93% annual return continues, they could become millionaires. The article notes that VOO is the sixth most-held security on Robinhood and the most popular ETF, outperforming the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which has a higher net expense ratio of 0.09%. The article cites Crestmont Research data showing that the S&P 500 has delivered positive annualized returns in every rolling 20-year period since the 20th century, suggesting long-term consistency. However, it also cautions that while VOO is a strong choice, the Motley Fool\u2019s Stock Advisor team did not include it in their list of top 10 recommended stocks, which have historically produced higher returns (e.g., Netflix and Nvidia). The article emphasizes the importance of low expense ratios, noting that even a 0.06% difference in fees can compound significantly over decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 07:51 AM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-history-repeats-no-1-exchange-traded-fund-etf-robinhood-can-make-investors-millionaires)\n\n**Investing in Value and High Dividends Outperforms Growth Strategies Globally**\nAccording to Duncan Lamont, head of strategic research at Schroders, investing in value and high-dividend stocks has outperformed growth-oriented investments over the past 12 months, particularly outside the United States. While growth stocks\u2014led by the 'Magnificent Seven' (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla)\u2014have driven the U.S. market rally, Lamont's analysis of the EAFE index (representing developed markets excluding North America) shows that value stocks delivered a 10% return in U.S. dollars from September 2024 to August 2025, outperforming the market by 6% and growth stocks by 13%. Growth stocks underperformed the index by 6%. This trend extends to longer time horizons: over three and five years, value stocks are significantly ahead of growth and market benchmarks. Even European and British value stocks have surpassed the S&P 500 over five years. Lamont attributes the success to valuation reversions, particularly in markets like the U.S., where extreme valuations have corrected. Surprisingly, companies with poor financial health\u2014those that were unprofitable 12 months ago and remain so\u2014outperformed consistently profitable firms by over 10%. Despite recent gains, valuations across all styles have become more balanced globally, with no style being particularly cheap or expensive. However, Lamont warns that U.S. valuations remain significantly elevated compared to historical norms and global peers. He concludes that global portfolios are overly exposed to U.S. growth stocks and underexposed to broader global opportunities, making active investment strategies more compelling than passive indexing.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 10:07 PM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/mercados/2025/10/09/68e6793d468aeb795c8b45a1.html)\n\n**U.S. Tech ETFs Lead the Way in Gains Amid Government Shutdown and Rate Cut Expectations**\nDespite a U.S. federal government shutdown, market expectations suggest Congress will quickly pass a funding bill, limiting economic impact. The shutdown has instead accelerated expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, prompting a surge of capital into high-growth AI and semiconductor-related technology stocks. Seven U.S. technology sector ETFs in Taiwan have seen both price and trading volume increases over the past month. The Taishin S&P Technology Select ETF (009807) notes that the restart of the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycle, combined with potential prolonged political gridlock, could heighten expectations for a 0.25% rate cut in October (99% probability) and a 0.50% cut for the year (90% probability), fueling further upward momentum in the U.S. equity market. Historical data from the past three rate-cutting cycles (since 2019) show that the S&P 500\u2019s information technology sector rose an average of 36.8% within one year after rate cuts\u2014significantly outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 18.3% gain. Investment firms highlight that the primary driver of U.S. market capitalization growth remains large-cap technology stocks. Passive ETFs tracking the S&P Technology Select Industry Index, such as the Taishin S&P Technology Select ETF, effectively capture top U.S. tech giants like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple, which collectively account for 40% of the index\u2019s weight. AI infrastructure demand is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2028, offering investors a favorable entry window. Cathay Investment Trust notes that despite short-term market volatility from the government shutdown, the fundamentals of the U.S. tech sector remain strong, presenting a buying opportunity during dips. They recommend the Cathay North America Technology ETF, which tracks the S&P North America Technology Industry Index and holds major tech leaders like Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Meta. According to Bank of America, global tech stock net inflows reached $9.3 billion in the past week, boosting the Nasdaq 100 Index to new record highs.

No single component will exceed 5% of the index. Key constituents include Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR), crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), and Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT). The index aims to reflect the growing integration of digital assets into global financial markets. Cameron Drinkwater, chief product and operations officer at S&P Dow Jones Indices, stated that the digital asset ecosystem has transitioned 'from the margins into a more established role in global markets.' Dinari plans to issue a tokenized version of the index, called a 'dShare,' enabling direct investor exposure, with the investable version expected by the end of 2025. The index could serve as the foundation for future passive crypto ETFs, similar to how the SPDR S&P 500 ETF tracks the S&P 500. Existing crypto index funds, such as the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) and Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index products (e.g., HASH11 and NCIQ), already offer diversified exposure to major digital assets via regulated ETFs. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly exploring a framework to allow traditional stocks to trade as tokenized assets on blockchain networks, signaling broader adoption of tokenization in finance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:44 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sp-digital-markets-50-index-cryptos-blockchain-stocks)\n\n**If History Repeats, the No. 1 Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on Robinhood Can Make Investors Millionaires With a $100,000 Initial Investment and $625 Monthly Contributions Over 20 Years**\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), the No. 1 ETF on Robinhood, has an ultra-low net expense ratio of 0.03% and tracks the S&P 500 index, which delivered an 8.93% average annual return (excluding dividends) over the 20-year period from October 4, 2005, to October 3, 2025. According to the article, if investors contribute $100,000 initially and $625 monthly over 20 years, assuming the historical 8.93% annual return continues, they could become millionaires. The article notes that VOO is the sixth most-held security on Robinhood and the most popular ETF, outperforming the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which has a higher net expense ratio of 0.09%. The article cites Crestmont Research data showing that the S&P 500 has delivered positive annualized returns in every rolling 20-year period since the 20th century, suggesting long-term consistency. However, it also cautions that while VOO is a strong choice, the Motley Fool\u2019s Stock Advisor team did not include it in their list of top 10 recommended stocks, which have historically produced higher returns (e.g., Netflix and Nvidia). The article emphasizes the importance of low expense ratios, noting that even a 0.06% difference in fees can compound significantly over decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 07:51 AM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-history-repeats-no-1-exchange-traded-fund-etf-robinhood-can-make-investors-millionaires)\n\n**Topic: Stock market indices**\nStock market indices measure the performance of specific segments of the stock market, calculated using the prices and often market capitalizations of constituent companies. A base value (e.g., 100 or 0) is assigned at a starting point, with subsequent changes tracked relative to that value to illustrate market trends over time. The S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest U.S. companies, rose from a base of 386.36 in 1957 to 4,472.16 by July 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average grew from 40.94 in 1896 to 42,544.22 by the end of 2024. The article highlights key global indices: the FTSE 100 (UK), Nikkei (Japan), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), and DAX (Germany), all considered bellwethers for their respective national economies. Broader international indices include the MSCI World (1,583 companies across 23 developed economies) and the EURO STOXX 50 (50 leading eurozone companies across major industries). Despite fluctuations and underperformance by many individual companies, all major indices ended the year with significant gains. Nvidia's share price surged in 2023 and 2024, making it the third-largest tech company globally by market capitalization.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 02:36 AM\nSource:[Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/1604/stock-market-indices/)\n\n**Investing in Value and High Dividends Outperforms Growth Strategies Globally**\nAccording to Duncan Lamont, head of strategic research at Schroders, investing in value and high-dividend stocks has outperformed growth-oriented investments over the past 12 months, particularly outside the United States. While growth stocks\u2014led by the 'Magnificent Seven' (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla)\u2014have driven the U.S. market rally, Lamont's analysis of the EAFE index (representing developed markets excluding North America) shows that value stocks delivered a 10% return in U.S. dollars from September 2024 to August 2025, outperforming the market by 6% and growth stocks by 13%. Growth stocks underperformed the index by 6%. This trend extends to longer time horizons: over three and five years, value stocks are significantly ahead of growth and market benchmarks. Even European and British value stocks have surpassed the S&P 500 over five years. Lamont attributes the success to valuation reversions, particularly in markets like the U.S., where extreme valuations have corrected. Surprisingly, companies with poor financial health\u2014those that were unprofitable 12 months ago and remain so\u2014outperformed consistently profitable firms by over 10%. Despite recent gains, valuations across all styles have become more balanced globally, with no style being particularly cheap or expensive. However, Lamont warns that U.S. valuations remain significantly elevated compared to historical norms and global peers. He concludes that global portfolios are overly exposed to U.S. growth stocks and underexposed to broader global opportunities, making active investment strategies more compelling than passive indexing.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 10:07 PM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/mercados/2025/10/09/68e6793d468aeb795c8b45a1.html)\n\n**Why the SPY ETF is Losing Billions While IVV and VOO Gain**\nThe SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) ETF has lost over $32 billion in assets in 2025, making it the worst-performing major ETF on Wall Street. In contrast, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) gained over $86 billion in assets, and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) added over $28 billion. SPY's asset decline has caused it to fall to third-largest ETF by assets, behind VOO ($762 billion) and IVV ($701 billion). The primary reason for SPY's outflow is its higher expense ratio of 0.09%, compared to VOO's 0.03% and IVV's 0.03%, resulting in $60 more in annual fees for a $100,000 investment. According to Morningstar, 'if everything else is equal, the fund with the lower fee is more aligned with investor interests.' Additionally, SPY's structure as a traditional mutual fund restricts managers from using derivatives to liquidate cash or reinvesting dividends, creating inefficiencies. SPY also received a Silver rating from Morningstar, while IVV and VOO earned Gold ratings. Analysts warn that S&P 500 ETFs, heavily weighted toward tech stocks like NVIDIA, Broadcom, and Microsoft, face significant risk if the 'AI bubble' bursts. OpenAI\u2019s recent deals\u2014valued at over $1 trillion, including a $100 billion agreement with Nvidia and a partnership with AMD\u2014may inflate demand artificially, raising concerns about sustainability and long-term profitability, as OpenAI lacks the capital to fulfill these commitments.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 06:31 PM\nSource:[Invezz - German](https://invezz.com/de/news/2025/10/08/darum-verliert-der-spy-etf-milliarden-wahrend-ivv-und-voo-zulegen/)\n\n**U.S. Tech ETFs Lead the Way in Gains Amid Government Shutdown and Rate Cut Expectations**\nDespite a U.S. federal government shutdown, market expectations suggest Congress will quickly pass a funding bill, limiting economic impact. The shutdown has instead accelerated expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, prompting a surge of capital into high-growth AI and semiconductor-related technology stocks. Seven U.S. technology sector ETFs in Taiwan have seen both price and trading volume increases over the past month. The Taishin S&P Technology Select ETF (009807) notes that the restart of the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycle, combined with potential prolonged political gridlock, could heighten expectations for a 0.25% rate cut in October (99% probability) and a 0.50% cut for the year (90% probability), fueling further upward momentum in the U.S. equity market. Historical data from the past three rate-cutting cycles (since 2019) show that the S&P 500\u2019s information technology sector rose an average of 36.8% within one year after rate cuts\u2014significantly outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 18.3% gain. Investment firms highlight that the primary driver of U.S. market capitalization growth remains large-cap technology stocks. Passive ETFs tracking the S&P Technology Select Industry Index, such as the Taishin S&P Technology Select ETF, effectively capture top U.S. tech giants like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple, which collectively account for 40% of the index\u2019s weight. AI infrastructure demand is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2028, offering investors a favorable entry window. Cathay Investment Trust notes that despite short-term market volatility from the government shutdown, the fundamentals of the U.S. tech sector remain strong, presenting a buying opportunity during dips. They recommend the Cathay North America Technology ETF, which tracks the S&P North America Technology Industry Index and holds major tech leaders like Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Meta. According to Bank of America, global tech stock net inflows reached $9.3 billion in the past week, boosting the Nasdaq 100 Index to new record highs. The China Trust NASDAQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, has delivered strong performance year-to-date due to its comprehensive exposure to leading growth stocks.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:43 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5618/9058423)\n\n**Index Funds or Individual Stocks? A Guide to Finding Your Investing Style * Benzinga**\nThe article 'Index Funds or Individual Stocks? A Guide to Finding Your Investing Style' from Benzinga, published on October 8, 2025, compares two major investment strategies: index investing and individual stock picking. Index investing involves passively tracking a market index\u2014such as the S&P 500\u2014through low-cost mutual funds or ETFs, offering diversification, low fees, simplicity, and historically strong long-term performance. It is recommended for most investors, especially beginners, retirees, and busy professionals seeking steady, market-matching returns with minimal effort. In contrast, individual stock picking requires in-depth research, time, and risk tolerance to identify undervalued companies with the potential to outperform the market. This strategy suits investors passionate about finance who can analyze financial statements, use stock screeners (e.g., from Finviz or Yahoo Finance), and actively manage their portfolios. However, it carries high risk, including potential for significant losses, and studies show most active managers fail to beat benchmarks. The article outlines implementation steps for both: for index investing, open a low-cost brokerage account (e.g., Fidelity, Vanguard, Charles Schwab), choose an index (e.g., S&P 500, total stock market), and use dollar-cost averaging; for stock picking, build a research framework, use screening tools, and monitor holdings regularly. The article concludes that the best strategy depends on individual goals, temperament, and skill level.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 02:01 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/money/choosing-index-funds-or-individual-stocks)\n\n**Wall Street Veteran Warns of Three 'Horrible' Scenarios for U.S. Stocks in October 2025; Combined Risk Could Trigger 30% Drop**\nThe S&P 500 index has been setting new historical highs, but the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), known as the 'fear index,' has simultaneously risen, indicating growing investor anxiety. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report and a veteran Wall Street analyst, warns of three potential scenarios that could trigger panic in the U.S. stock market in October 2025. If investors simultaneously recognize these risks\u2014AI investment potentially being in a bubble, a looming consumer credit crisis due to stagnant incomes and rising prices, and an accelerating labor market deterioration\u2014then the S&P 500 could drop by as much as 30%. The first scenario centers on AI, with rising valuations of unprofitable startups like OpenAI (now valued at $500 billion) and increasing cycle financing deals involving Nvidia and its clients, despite a lack of clear paths to profitability. A collapse of the AI bubble could lead to sharp earnings downgrades at major tech firms like Nvidia and Meta, and reduced capital spending, affecting non-tech sectors. The second scenario involves consumers, whose income growth has failed to keep pace with inflation, creating fears of a 'small-scale' credit crisis among financial institutions like Synchrony Financial. The third scenario is a weakening labor market, with current market expectations of unemployment peaking at 4.5% or 4.6%, but Essaye argues such levels have historically been followed by further increases. He emphasizes that the market currently underprices the risk of a recession, which could eventually materialize. Essaye concludes that the true 'horrific scenario' would be when all three risks are recognized at once, potentially causing a 30% drop in the S&P 500, with recovery taking years.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 10:28 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6811/9058073)\n\n**If You'd Invested $1,000 in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today**\nInvesting $1,000 in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) in early October 2020 would have yielded a total return of 113% as of October 2, 2025, increasing the initial investment to over $2,130.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates gold is very overbought, increasing the risk of a pullback. The 'momo crowd' is driving bullish sentiment, with speculation about gold reaching $5,000 by next year. Foreigners are increasingly favoring gold over U.S. dollars, raising concerns among 'smart money' about the implications for the U.S. economy and stock market. However, the analysis argues that this gold demand is not driven by long-term investors or strong physical demand, but by speculative momentum traders buying simply because prices are rising. The VIX has risen for five consecutive days while the S&P 500 also rose\u2014a historically unprecedented event since the VIX's creation in 1990. The analysis interprets this as smart money using VIX derivatives to hedge against rising equity markets, while simultaneously trimming positions. In the Magnificent Seven stocks, early trade money flows are positive for Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and NVIDIA (NVDA); neutral for Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT); and negative for Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) show positive early money flows.

This surge in capex is fueling strong corporate earnings growth, with analysts forecasting a 12% increase in earnings for 2025 and 2026. As a result, the S&P 500\u2019s valuation drops from 28 times current earnings to 23 times forecasted earnings, making it appear less expensive despite still being high. However, significant downside risks exist, particularly concentration risk: the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks account for 36% of the S&P 500\u2019s market cap and 55% of its year-to-date return. Nvidia alone contributed 4.4% to the index\u2019s return and represents 8% of its value. A few missed quarters from these tech giants could trigger a sharp market correction. While historical precedent shows such concentration is not unprecedented, investors can mitigate risk by diversifying into equal-weighted S&P 500 funds, mid-cap indices like the S&P 400, or ETFs excluding the Magnificent Seven. Alternatively, actively managed US equity funds typically underweight these tech giants and may offer resilience.

The article notes that the S&P\u202f500 has become highly concentrated: the ten largest stocks now account for nearly 40\u202f% of the index\u2019s market value, up from 30\u202f% five years ago and 25\u202f% before the dot\u2011com bubble. The \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Tesla) now represent over 34\u202f% of the index, while five stocks alone make up 28\u202f% of the index. A 5\u202f% move in Nvidia therefore has eight times the impact on the index compared with a 5\u202f% move in a smaller company such as Visa. Equal\u2011weighting spreads risk more evenly, diluting the impact of high\u2011flyers and cushioning against sector bubbles, but it requires regular rebalancing, higher turnover and higher transaction costs. Market\u2011cap ETFs are self\u2011rebalancing, have lower fees and tend to lean into momentum and growth factors, while equal\u2011weight ETFs tilt toward value and small\u2011cap, offering higher volatility and drawdown risk during market stress. The choice between the two depends on an investor\u2019s philosophy: passive, low\u2011cost core holdings favour market\u2011cap ETFs, whereas tactical allocation or hedging against concentration risk favours equal\u2011weight ETFs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 02:04 AM\nSource:[Moneyweb](https://www.moneyweb.co.za/financial-advisor-views/choosing-between-sp-500-market-cap-and-equal-weight-etfs-a-strategic-investors-guide/)\n\n**Your S&P 500 Index Fund Might Not Be as Diverse As You Think -- And You Can Blame Nvidia for That**\nThe article explains that Nvidia dominates the S&P\u202f500, accounting for 7.3% of the index\u2019s market\u2011capitalization\u2014about the same value as the bottom 231 companies combined\u2014and that this weight is the largest for any single company in the past 35\u202fyears, according to Leuthold Group data cited by The New\u202fYork\u202fTimes. Nvidia also makes up nearly 7% of the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), over 13% of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), and 16% of the SPDR Technology Select Sector ETF (XLK). The \"Magnificent\u202f7\" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Broadcom, and Nvidia) now represent more than a third (34%) of the S&P\u202f500 by market\u2011cap. Because the S&P\u202f500 is market\u2011cap\u2011weighted, Nvidia\u2019s recent surge in AI\u2011chip demand has amplified its influence, meaning that investors in the index are largely exposed to tech stocks. The Vanguard S&P\u202f500 ETF (VOO) is up close to 10% in 2025, and Nvidia is responsible for about a fifth of those gains, per an ETF.com report; if the trend continues, Nvidia would account for a fifth of the fund\u2019s total growth for a second consecutive year. \"With the Magnificent\u202f7 stocks comprising such a massive proportion of the S&P\u202f500's market capitalization, we've been exploring ways to still maintain large\u2011cap U.S. equity exposure without increasing our Mag\u202f7 exposure,\" said David Flores Wilson, a certified financial planner at Sincerus Advisory in New\u202fYork\u202fCity. \"One way we've been doing this is by allocating to equal\u2011weight S&P\u202f500 ETFs like Invesco's Equal Weight ETF (RSP).\" RSP returned about 5.7% in 2025 versus 8.6% for VOO, but in 2022 it fell 11.6% compared with an 18.2% drop for VOO, showing that equal\u2011weight funds can perform better when tech stocks underperform. The article concludes that while Nvidia\u2019s performance has lifted the S&P\u202f500, its outsized presence also introduces downside risk if its shares were to decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 30, 2025 01:38 AM\nSource:[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/your-s-and-p-500-index-fund-might-not-be-as-diverse-as-you-think-and-you-can-blame-nvidia-for-that-11800715)\n\n**Hedge Funds' 2Q Investment in Mega-Cap Tech: Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, and More**\nHedge funds have significantly increased their holdings in major technology companies in the second quarter of 2025. According to data collected by HedgeFollow from 13F filings, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) were among the most heavily bought stocks. These 8 companies make up a significant portion of the S&P 500 index's market capitalization and are therefore notable holdings. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was the most heavily bought ETF by hedge funds in the second quarter, with Proficio Capital Partners buying approximately $749 million, Farallon Capital Management buying around $324 million, and Goldman Sachs Group buying $121 million. These hedge fund positioning trends reflect the growing confidence of institutional investors in US large-cap technology stocks, particularly those benefiting from the secular trend of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. These companies were primarily bought by top funds such as Bridgewater Associates, Tiger Global, Discovery Capital, Coatue Management, and Lone Pine Capital. Broadcom's strong performance and forecasted increase in AI infrastructure demand played a significant role in adding the company to hedge fund portfolios. Meanwhile, stable demand for NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Alphabet has shown investors' confidence in the long-term growth prospects of AI businesses. The concentrated hedge fund interest in mega-cap technology stocks highlights their dominant influence on stock market trends. The 'Magnificent Seven' (excluding Broadcom) have accounted for a significant portion of the S&P 500 index's returns in 2025. As a result, ETFs like SPY, which track the index, have benefited from the increased hedge fund inflows. Strategists note that the strong inflows into SPY reflect institutional investors' preference for diversified exposure, but emphasize that the underlying driver remains the concentrated interest in a small number of mega-cap technology companies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 19, 2025 05:45 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/47199624/2)\n\n**Why S&P 500 Outperforms Most - and What We Can Learn from It**\nThe S&P 500 index has consistently outperformed actively managed funds, individual investors, and even hedge funds with multi-billion dollar budgets for analysis. This is not just a statistical anomaly, but a window into the deep market logic and how value is created in the long term. Investors like Warren Buffett often advise the average person to simply invest in the index and do nothing. At first glance, this may seem like a lack of activity, but in reality, it reflects an understanding of how the index works. It is not a static collection of companies, but an evolving mechanism that automatically increases the weight of winners and eliminates losers. It constantly adapts to the new economic reality, reflecting the most important aspects of the American and global economy. The concept of 'center' is also introduced, where the most successful investors identify the few companies or sectors that are at the epicenter of economic momentum. Apple, for example, is not just a technology company, but a hub of hardware, software, brand, and logistics. Nvidia is not just a chip manufacturer, but a key player in the era of AI. Amazon is not just a retailer, but a logistics and cloud infrastructure. These companies gradually increase their weight in the index. Investing in it means investing in the dynamics of economic evolution - without having to guess the future. Some investors, like Buffett with Apple, Druckenmiller with Nvidia, and Taper with Meta, recognize the center before it becomes obvious to everyone. That's why they sometimes outperform the index. But for the average investor, S&P 500 remains a 'smart' enough index to provide good performance without active intervention. Can it be even better? Yes - if we combine the discipline of passive investing with elements of active analysis and understanding of which sectors will be the center of tomorrow's economy. Platforms like Alex can play a role here - not just copying the index, but educating users to understand it, recognize rotations, and build intelligent portfolios. If the index is a wave, Alex should be the surfer who feels it first.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 05, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[News.bg](https://news.bg/personal-finance/zashto-s-p-500-pobezhdava-pochti-vsichki-i-kakvo-mozhem-da-nauchim-ot-tova.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters offer a range of probabilities (from 37% to 67%) regarding whether Nvidia will outperform the S&P 500 in 2025, with most clustering just below or above 50%. Nearly all experts agree on several fundamental points: (1) Nvidia has enjoyed massive outperformance fueled by AI-driven demand, strong earnings, and momentum, but (2) history and base rates suggest that individual stocks\u2014especially mega-caps after extraordinary runs\u2014usually underperform the S&P 500 due to mean reversion and elevated valuation risk. Key positive factors highlighted include AI infrastructure demand, expected Fed rate cuts boosting tech, strong institutional/ETF inflows, and Nvidia\u2019s continued leadership in AI hardware. Negative factors consistently cited are mean reversion, extreme valuation/\"AI bubble\" risk, concentration in the index (making outperformance structurally harder since Nvidia is already a major part of the S&P 500), and possible market-wide rotation out of tech/growth into value sectors. Scenarios for underperformance typically involve AI capex slowing, earnings disappointments, or market corrections, while outperformance scenarios involve continued earnings beats, persistent AI/tech momentum, and unbroken investor enthusiasm. Technical/behavioral and macro perspectives slightly raise the probability due to near-term momentum and macro tailwinds, but fundamental, factor, and life-cycle perspectives caution against betting on persistent outperformance. In summary: while there remains a plausible chance for Nvidia to outperform due to strong sectoral and macro support, the weight of historical precedent and structural challenges lead most experts to assign a probability modestly below or just above 50%, reflecting a high-risk/high-reward situation with no clear consensus but a tilt toward underperformance as the base case.",
