The far\u2011right Progress Party (FRP) doubled its share to about 24\u202f%. Prime Minister\u2011elect Jonas\u202fGahr\u202fSt\u00f8re will seek either a coalition with the other left parties or outside support for a minority AP government. The four smaller left\u2011bloc parties \u2013 Centre (SP), Socialist Left (SV), Red and Greens (MDG) \u2013 together hold 35\u202f% of the seats. The article notes that the parties approved a 12\u2011year military\u2011spending plan that will add 600\u202fbn\u202fkroner (\u2248\u202f\u20ac50\u202fbn) to the defence budget, including 136\u202fbn\u202fkroner for five frigates, and a new Arctic strategy \u201cNorway in the North\u201d. It also reports that the government will provide 85\u202fbn\u202fkroner to Ukraine in 2025. The GPFG, valued at \u20ac1.7\u202ftrillion, is capped at 3\u202f% annual spending, so the war\u2011related budget is funded at the expense of public services. Energy prices hit a record high in December\u202f2024, and Labour\u2019s popularity fell to 14\u202f% in polls. The Centre Party left the coalition, dropping from 13\u202f% in 2021 to 5.6\u202f%. St\u00f8re appointed former NATO Secretary\u2011General Jens\u202fStoltenberg as Finance Minister and introduced a \u201cNorway price\u201d of 0.4\u202fkroner per kWh, effective 1\u202fOctober. Trade Union Confederation (LO) leader Kine\u202fAsper\u202fVistnes praised the result, saying 'Our social model is based on freedom, equality, and solidarity, and it has proven itself well equipped to handle crises and transitions.' The article criticises the right\u2011wing parties for supporting NATO militarism and war, and portrays the new government as likely to deepen Norway\u2019s involvement in the conflict with Russia. It also quotes NHO head Ole\u202fErik\u202fAlmlid saying 'I am sure that ways can be found to cooperate well with both the Storting and government in the future.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 03:37 AM\nSource:[World Socialist](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/09/12/a006-s12.html)\n\n**Norwegian Labour Party Slows Rightward Shift in Scandinavia**\nThe Norwegian Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet) secured a second four\u2011year term for Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re after the centre\u2011left coalition won a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169\u2011member Storting. The Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet) made a historic jump, nearly doubling its vote share to almost 24\u202f% and gaining 48 seats. Labour finished first with about 28\u202f% of the vote, while the Conservatives (H\u00f8yre), led by former Prime Minister Erna Solberg, slipped to their worst result in two decades at 14.6\u202f%, leaving the right\u2011wing bloc with only three seats. Voter turnout was high at 78.9\u202f%, with more than 1.9\u202fmillion early votes cast.\n\nThe campaign focused on finances and international issues: the persistent cost\u2011of\u2011living crisis, the future of the wealth tax (a 1.1\u202f% levy on assets above 1.7\u202fmillion crowns), and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Labour defended keeping the wealth tax, the Conservatives proposed cuts, and the nationalist Progress Party sought to abolish it, buoyed by social\u2011media campaigns that mobilised young voters.\n\nCoalition arithmetic remains complex; any pact with the four smaller parties (three left\u2011wing and one centrist) must overcome differences on oil exploration, taxes, deep\u2011sea mining and the stance on Gaza.\n\nGeopolitics also weighed in: St\u00f8re\u2019s allies are pressuring the two\u2011trillion\u2011dollar oil fund to divest from Israeli companies, citing their role in prolonging the Gaza war. At the same time, relations with a second\u2011term Donald Trump and NATO commitments framed discussions on energy security and Norway\u2019s role as Europe\u2019s main gas supplier since 2022, replacing Russia.\n\nSt\u00f8re\u2019s surge is partly attributed to the \u2018Stoltenback\u2019: the February return of former NATO chief and ex\u2011Labour Prime Minister Jens\u202fStoltenberg as Finance Minister, which stabilised the party after cabinet controversies and electoral instability.\n\nIf the Labour Party can turn its slim advantage into a solid government, Norway will distinguish itself from Sweden and Finland, which are currently governed by right\u2011wing coalitions, and will curb the rightward trend seen across Scandinavia.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 06:42 PM\nSource:[24 Horas](https://24-horas.mx/mundo/laborismo-noruego-frena-viraje-derechista-de-escandinavia/)\n\n**Stoltenberg's Victory, Putin's Friends' Failure: What Norway's Elections Show**\nThe 8 September 2025 Norwegian parliamentary election saw the Labour Party win 53 seats, five more than before, but still short of the 85 seats needed for an outright majority.

MDG leader Arild Hermstad celebrated the breakthrough, saying, 'Vi klarte \u00e5 bryte sperregrensen og det har v\u00e6rt t\u00f8ffe tider.' He added that the party will push for \u2018real climate action\u2019 and a safe transition out of the oil era.\n\nSV leader Kirsti Bergst\u00f8 urged a stricter stance on the oil fund, declaring, 'Vi har sagt det hele veien, og vi gjentar det, at vi er n\u00f8dt til \u00e5 trekke oljefondet ut av folkemord.'\n\nH\u00f8yre\u2019s Erna Solberg criticised the result, noting, 'Vi havnet i en skvis mellom Arbeiderpartiet og Frp.

Norway\u2019s energy future also dominated the debate; after Russia\u2019s exit as a major gas supplier, Norway has become Europe\u2019s largest gas exporter, a role the EU aims to expand by phasing out Russian gas by 2027.  Smaller Labour\u2011aligned parties seek to curb new oil\u2011exploration projects, potentially limiting future gas output and creating tension within the coalition.

The voting law has changed: only the Valdirektoratet knows the results until 21:00\u202fh, after which media can download the data and NRK will broadcast the first numbers a few seconds after 21:00.  The first figures shown will be the results of the record\u2011high early\u2011voting turnout \u2013 more than 1.9\u202fmillion voters cast ballots before the official voting day.  These early votes are tallied on Monday morning and are available to the Valdirektoratet at 21:00, so NRK\u2019s initial numbers will reflect almost two million votes.  However, the article stresses that early\u2011voting results are not the final outcome because voting patterns differ between early and on\u2011day voters; younger voters tend to vote early, while older voters vote on the day, which can shift party totals.  NRK will therefore present a forecast model that updates throughout the evening as more votes are counted.  The forecast will show the final seat allocation and the national vote share for each party, and it will be updated in real time.  The article also outlines the political landscape: the red side (Labour, Socialist Left, Centre, and Green Party) supports the current government, while the blue side (Conservative, Progress, Christian Democrats, and Venstre) wants a change.  The forecast will indicate whether the red side can reach the 85\u2011seat threshold needed for a majority.

Small parties could be decisive because only those surpassing the 4\u202f% threshold enter parliament; the current poll average gives the centre\u2011left 88 seats and the opposition 81. The Progress Party, founded in 1973 and now led by ultra\u2011right\u2011wing Sylvi\u202fListhaug, has doubled its support since 2021, when it received 11.6\u202f% of the vote. If the centre\u2011left wins, St\u00f8re is expected to remain prime minister for another four years; if the right wins, the next prime minister could be Listhaug or Conservative leader Erna\u202fSolberg. The election is framed by economic issues such as the high cost of living, taxes, electricity prices and management of Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.

Each expert, drawing from their respective fields\u2014election analysis, statistical forecasting, political science, and area studies\u2014highlights several decisive factors: the dominance of major parties (especially Labour and Progress), the severe constraints on small or single-issue parties imposed by Norway's proportional representation system and 4% threshold, the complete absence of Patient Focus from published seat totals or media coverage as a significant winner, and the historic lack of precedent for such a party achieving plurality. Multiple sources and news reports converge, consistently listing Labour as holding the most seats and not mentioning Patient Focus as a contender. Experts agree that only a nearly impossible reporting or tabulation error, contrary to all current evidence, could result in a Yes outcome. Base rates indicate that protest or niche parties have never won the most seats in modern Norwegian elections. Consequently, all experts set their final probability at 0%, emphasizing that while technical certainty can never be absolute, the likelihood of Patient Focus winning the most seats is as close to zero as epistemically possible.",
