Your highlighting of industry-wide market reactions\u2014where competitors dismantle the failed target\u2019s network rather than angle for a full-scale rescue\u2014is also a key corroborating signal of the impossibility of sudden reversal. In sum, your focus on both procedure and precedent draws a complete and compelling argument for a probability near zero."

By drawing from Porter\u2019s model, you correctly frame the problem: the bargaining power of buyers (Spirit's creditors), fierce rivalry among existing firms, and lack of regulatory or financial incentive for JetBlue all point away from a deal materializing. In M&A theory, such external pressures frequently preclude strategic acquisitions, especially where regulatory forces act as a decisive external constraint\u2014a point you emphasize by referencing the DOJ block and lack of industry appetite for large-scale distressed acquisitions. The only dimension I would sharpen is recognizing that, even under extreme distress, the move is towards asset liquidation or piecemeal transfers, not wholesale rescue by a previously-blocked strategic buyer. Your anchoring on base rates for blocked airline mergers and the pronounced inertia in regulatory policy further highlights the well-grounded near-zero forecast. In summary, your argument is not only compatible with but strongly complements business M&A theory, and holistically supports a near-certain No resolution."

By highlighting the factual abandonment of the deal, Spirit\u2019s progressive deterioration, and the opportunistic posture of rivals absorbing routes and capacity, you provide a grounded industry perspective that matches the forces identified in Porter\u2019s framework. Specifically, you show how the threat of new entrants is negligible, while incumbent rivalry is focused on market share capture rather than consolidation, and regulatory barriers remain decisive. Your recognition that only an extraordinary, unseen exogenous shift could prompt a Yes outcome coincides with the strategic realities driving both JetBlue's and Spirit's decisions. This focused, status-quo-centered outlook is both historically defensible and consistent with structural industry analysis."

The reference to recent DOT and DOJ moves, the absence of merger signals, and the fact that other airlines prefer to acquire assets piecemeal all reinforce both the legal and practical barriers. This complements the antitrust analysis by showing how, even were a theoretical deal resurrected, the regulatory process itself would prevent it being announced\u2014let alone closed\u2014before 2026. Your rationale helps demonstrate why the antitrust base rate and the ongoing legal and procedural context render a JetBlue acquisition announcement not just unlikely, but virtually impossible in the given time frame."

The emphasis on the tendency for distressed carriers to see their routes and assets cannibalized by competitors, rather than being acquired outright by previously-blocked strategic buyers, aligns closely with antitrust market definition realities: removal of a major ultra-low-cost competitor is not only unpalatable to regulators, but is also strategically out of favor with possible acquirers. You correctly note that industry actors and regulators are not shifting posture, and the pattern of rivals filling gaps rather than seeking wholesale mergers is a telling signal. These externalities reinforce my own perspective that all market definition analysis and legal precedent combine to make a JetBlue acquisition before 2026 an extreme outlier, further supporting a probability near-zero."

Your point that DOT and DOJ posture, combined with the total lack of new filings or lobbying, makes a last-minute reversal virtually impossible is especially relevant. The industry norm\u2014where failed mergers in this sector stay failed, and competitors focus on poaching routes/assets, not direct acquisition\u2014only further reinforces your reasoning. You correctly recognize that the market and regulatory environment has not shifted in any meaningful way to allow for a merger announcement before 2026. The absence of public negotiation signals and the unaltered antitrust climate means the practical and legal impossibility of a JetBlue acquisition announcement is overwhelming.

It's particularly salient that, after formal deal termination, a meaningful corporate transaction cannot just be 'willed' into existence; it must overcome multiple structural and legal hurdles. Additionally, bankruptcy oversight means even a distressed sale couldn't close, nor even be normally announced, before substantial court proceedings.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn July 28, 2022, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1158463/000119312522204208/d319514dex991.htm) that their boards of directors had approved a merger between the two companies through which JetBlue would acquire Spirit for $33.50 a share, at an enterprise value of $7.6 billion, and following the merger would eventually operate as a single airline under the JetBlue name and be the 5th largest airline in the United States. The airlines [planned](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/business/jetblue-spirit-merger.html) to complete the transaction in the first half of 2024.  On October 19, 2022 Spirit's shareholders [approved](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1498710/000149871022000336/a221019stockholderapprov.htm) the deal. \n\nOn March 7, 2023, the US Department of Justice [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-jetblue-s-proposed-acquisition-spirit) an antitrust lawsuit to block the acquisition on the grounds that it would harm consumers by eliminating an ultra-low-cost carrier, which would result in, according to the DOJ, \"raising costs for the flying public and harming cost-conscious fliers most acutely.\" JetBlue and Spirit [announced](https://investor.jetblue.com/news/news-details/2023/JetBlue-and-Spirit-Will-Continue-to-Advance-Plan-to-Create-Compelling-National-Low-Fare-Challenger-to-the-Dominant-U.S.-Carriers/default.aspx) that they would \"vigorously defend\"  against the DOJ's suit, arguing that the post-merger JetBlue would be a stronger and more competitive airline against the legacy carriers.\n\nAccording to [research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/done-deal-why-many-large-transactions-fail-to-cross-the-finish-line) by McKinsey, in any given year about 10% of large M&A transactions are cancelled, with larger combinations being more likely to be cancelled.

According to a memo from CEO Dave Davis cited by CNBC, the carrier will trim its November flight schedule, expecting a roughly 25% drop in capacity this year as it \"optimises\" its network for stronger markets. Davis said, '\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bb6\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u3002' He added that negotiations with union leaders will take place in the coming weeks. The airline has already suspended and demoted hundreds of pilots, and some cabin crew are on unpaid leave. In the March\u2011June period, Spirit posted a $257\u202fmillion loss, and after a failed merger with JetBlue, it faces higher costs, weak U.S. travel demand and intense competition. The story was reported by CNBC and published by the Malaysian Oriental Daily (\u4e1c\u65b9\u7f51).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 04:57 AM\nSource:[\u6771\u65b9\u7db2 \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u6771\u65b9\u65e5\u5831](https://www.orientaldaily.com.my/news/business/2025/09/18/762371)\n\n**Spirit Airlines to Cut Jobs and Reduce Flights Amid Second Restructuring in 2025 - EconoTimes**\nSpirit Airlines announced a second restructuring for 2025 that will cut about 25% of its flight capacity and lead to significant job losses. Chief Executive Dave Davis explained that the changes aim to 'optimize' the carrier\u2019s network by concentrating on stronger markets, but acknowledged that the evaluations will inevitably affect staffing levels, with union leaders to be consulted in the coming weeks. The move follows earlier capacity reductions from March to June and follows the airline\u2019s exit from its first bankruptcy. Spirit has already implemented furloughs, demotions for hundreds of pilots, and unpaid leave for many flight attendants. Financially, the airline reported a $257\u202fmillion loss for the March\u2011June period, amid higher operating costs, softer U.S. travel demand, and increased competition, especially after a failed merger with JetBlue Airways.

Kirby said, 'Because I'm good at math,' to explain why he believes Spirit will fail, during a Q&A at the Airline Passenger Experience Association conference in Long Beach, California. He has long criticized discount carriers for relying on growth that he says is unsustainable, and he warned that a model that 'predicated on'screw the customer' is doomed.

United has begun operating new flights in markets where Spirit previously flew, giving customers alternatives if Spirit ceases service.  In late August\u202f2025, Frontier Airlines announced a similar strategy, adding 20 new routes in former Spirit markets; Deutsche Bank analysts said Frontier profited from Spirit's bankruptcy.  Both United and Frontier face challenges from customer preference for premium options, an oversupply of domestic flights, and rising labor costs.  Spirit filed for Chapter\u202f11 bankruptcy in August, its second filing within a year; after the filing, Spirit cut routes and staff, creating opportunities for rivals.  Kirby noted that 'If I dig deeper into it and I look at every airline that's not named United Airlines or Delta Airlines, I can find at every single one of them, a double\u2011digit percentage of their route network that loses money,' and argued that struggling airlines must 'stop flying to places that lose money.'

DOT cited concerns that the partnership violated the U.S.\u2013Mexico 'open skies' agreement by limiting access to Mexico City\u2019s airport.  The decision follows a tentative non\u2011renewal in January\u202f2024 and formally sets an official end date for the collaboration.  The joint venture had allowed the two SkyTeam carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing and revenue sharing as if they were a single airline, offering reciprocal frequent\u2011flyer benefits and seamless transfers for passengers traveling between the United States and Mexico.  With the partnership dissolved, passengers may face longer connection times and fewer flight options, and fares could vary depending on which carrier sells the ticket.  Delta\u2019s spokesperson said, 'We are disappointed that the Department of Transportation has chosen to terminate its approval of the strategic and pro\u2011competitive partnership between Delta and Aeromexico, a decision that will cause significant harm to U.S. jobs, communities and consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico.'

The carrier is reportedly considering selling spare engines or gate rights to raise cash in the short\u2011to\u2011medium term.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 12, 2025 11:46 AM\nSource:[aerotime.aero](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/spirit-airlines-warning-investors-finances)\n\n**JetBlue, United partnership gets go-ahead from U.S. Transportation...**\nJetBlue and United Airlines have received approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation to proceed with their partnership, dubbed 'Blue Sky', which will allow travelers to book flights on both carriers' websites and earn points in their frequent flyer programs.

The partnership, which would have allowed the two airlines to coordinate flights and share revenue, was terminated after the lower court ruling. American Airlines expressed disappointment with the decision, arguing that it unfairly annulled a joint venture and demonstrated a hostile stance towards business cooperation. According to American Airlines, the 'Northeast Alliance' would have increased competition and expanded customer options in the Northeast. However, the US Department of Justice, under the Biden administration, argued that the partnership would harm consumers by eliminating incentives for American Airlines to lower prices to attract customers from Jetblue, a competing airline with often lower fares. A Boston district court ruled in favor of the Department of Justice in 2023, finding that the partnership violated antitrust law. As a result, Jetblue ended the partnership to pursue the acquisition of Spirit Airlines, which was also challenged by the Department of Justice under Biden.\nOriginal language: eo\nPublish date: July 01, 2025 11:16 AM\nSource:[airliners.de](https://www.airliners.de/us-gerichtshof-bestaetigt-verbot-allianz-american-jetblue/81653)\n\n**JetBlue to Suspend Flights from Miami International Airport**\nJetBlue Airways, a major low-cost airline in the United States, has announced that it will suspend all flights from the Miami International Airport (MIA) starting from September 3, 2025. This decision comes after years of economic losses and a complex landscape for the aviation sector following the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Derek Dombrowski, JetBlue's Director of Corporate Communications, 'This measure responds to a consolidation strategy to focus resources on more profitable routes.' The airline had operated up to 14 daily flights to MIA, but its presence has been reduced to one or two daily flights between Miami and Boston. JetBlue has reported significant losses, including a net loss of $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $208 million in the first quarter of 2025. The airline's attempt to expand through a merger with Spirit Airlines was also blocked by the US government due to antitrust concerns. Passengers with flights scheduled from or to MIA after September 3 will have two options: 'We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible experience, and we will continue to operate from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL), where we have a strong presence,' said a JetBlue spokesperson.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 25, 2025 02:05 AM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/respuestas/us/esta-famosa-aerolinea-le-dice-adios-al-aeropuerto-de-miami-lo-que-pasara-desde-el-3-de-septiembre-estados-unidos-nnda-nnlt-noticia/)\n\n**United Airlines and JetBlue Launch 'Blue Sky' Partnership**\nUnited Airlines and JetBlue Airways have announced a strategic partnership called 'Blue Sky' to offer passengers greater flexibility in booking and access to a wider network. This collaboration allows travelers to book flights on both airlines' websites and accumulate or redeem loyalty points interchangeably. Subject to regulatory approval, some aspects of the partnership may begin as early as autumn 2025. United Airlines will have up to seven daily slots at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) starting from 2027, marking its return to JFK after leaving in 2022. JetBlue will receive additional time slots at Newark Liberty International Airport, strengthening its presence at United's East Coast hub. United Airlines' CEO, Scott Kirby, has described the move as a mistake. The airline briefly returned to JFK in 2021 due to a decrease in traffic at the airport caused by COVID-19. United had to leave JFK in 2022 because it was unable to secure long-term slot allocations. The partnership highlights the integration of loyalty programs, allowing members of United's MileagePlus and JetBlue's TrueBlue to accumulate and redeem points on both airlines. Passengers with elite status can enjoy reciprocal benefits, including upgrades and flexibility in changing flights. The loyalty programs of airlines are becoming increasingly important revenue streams. During the COVID-19 pandemic, US airlines used these programs to generate revenue and raise funds. In 2023, United Airlines' loyalty program revenue reached $3.49 billion, a 10% increase from the previous year. The airline will increase lounge access fees to $1,400 starting from March 2025. Both airlines will maintain independent control over their flight operations, including schedules and prices. This approach distinguishes the 'Blue Sky' alliance from JetBlue's previous Northeast Alliance with American Airlines, which was dissolved in 2023 due to antitrust concerns. This is not the only setback United Airlines has faced regarding a collaboration. In 2024, a US federal judge blocked United Airlines' proposal to acquire low-cost carrier Spirit, citing that the deal would remove a low-cost carrier from the market. The implications of this partnership are strategic for both airlines. For United Airlines, it facilitates a strategic return to JFK, resolving previous operational issues at Newark and expanding its presence in the competitive New York market. JetBlue, on the other hand, gains greater access to Newark, aligning with its focus on leisure travel on the East Coast and efforts to overcome post-pandemic profitability challenges. In the last nine quarters, JetBlue has reported a profit only in two of them. The 'Blue Sky' alliance represents a significant step towards improving passenger comfort and expanding network connectivity for both United Airlines and JetBlue. While the partnership awaits regulatory approval, travelers can expect a more integrated and flexible flying experience in the future.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 01:18 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/it/notizie/2025/05/29/united-airlines-e-jetblue-lanciano-la-collaborazione-blue-sky/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts unanimously forecast an extremely low probability (1%) that JetBlue will announce it has acquired Spirit Airlines before 2026. Their reasoning is anchored in the fact that the JetBlue-Spirit merger was formally abandoned in March 2024 following a federal antitrust block and judicial decision in January 2024. Since then, Spirit Airlines has entered bankruptcy twice and is undergoing severe financial distress, downsizing, and restructuring, with competitors like United and Frontier moving to capture Spirit's market share and assets but not pursuing acquisition. JetBlue has shifted focus to partnerships (notably with United), and there has been no indication of renewed negotiations or intentions to revive the deal. The regulatory and antitrust climate remains highly unfavorable to large airline mergers, especially those that reduce competition among ultra-low-cost carriers. Experts consistently note the historical base rate for previously blocked/abandoned airline mergers being completed within such a tight window is close to zero, especially with ongoing bankruptcy and clear industry signaling that all parties have moved on. Only a dramatic and currently unforeseen regulatory, political, or financial shock could produce a different outcome. All expert scenarios for a 'Yes' require extremely unlikely events, while the 'No' outcome aligns with the ongoing news, public statements, competitor actions, and regulatory precedent.",
