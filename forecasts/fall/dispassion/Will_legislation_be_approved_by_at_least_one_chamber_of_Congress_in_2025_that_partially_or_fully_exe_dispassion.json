It requires that, upon request, the U.S. Government and its agencies disclose previously unavailable non-classified information. Journalists and citizen groups have consistently relied on the FOIA to expose government misconduct. For example, activists discovered in the 1980s that the Environmental Protection Agency knew that paper mills were polluting toxic waste into rivers. In 2016, President Obama signed an update to the bill that sought to create greater transparency. The update undid initial exemptions for information about the deliberation of government agencies. It also mandated government agencies to prefer openness when receiving an FOIA request (\"presumption of disclosure\").\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":34509,\"question_id\":34025}}`",

GOA initially filed the FOIA request in 2021 seeking information on the ATF\u2019s use of the FBI\u2019s National Instant Background Check System. After the ATF failed to respond, GOA sued and eventually received some documents, but the agency also disclosed additional materials it claimed were not part of the original request and demanded their deletion. When GOA refused, the ATF obtained a court order prohibiting dissemination of those records. GOA has appealed, and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press reports that prominent media organizations\u2014including The Atlantic, Axios, National Public Radio, and The New York Times\u2014have filed an amicus brief with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals urging reversal of the lower court\u2019s decision. The brief argues that allowing the government to impose prior restraints on lawfully obtained information, even if inadvertently disclosed, undermines the First Amendment and creates a dangerous precedent that could stifle press freedom. The amici cite the Pentagon Papers and Florida Star v. B.J.F. to assert that truthful information lawfully obtained from the government cannot be suppressed merely because it was disclosed by mistake or could have been withheld under FOIA exemptions. The brief emphasizes that the First Amendment protects the public\u2019s right to access and disseminate information, not just professional journalists. The article notes that while many of these media outlets may misrepresent gun rights, they are correct in defending GOA\u2019s First Amendment rights. The D.C. Circuit previously vacated a similar lower court ruling in January 2025 involving the U.S. Park Police, reinforcing the argument that prior restraints on publication are unconstitutional. The article concludes by criticizing mainstream media for their perceived bias on gun rights while affirming their support for press freedom in this case.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 08:31 PM\nSource:[Bearing Arms](https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2025/11/26/major-press-outlets-side-with-goa-in-lawsuit-over-atf-records-n1230742)\n\n**Transparency & Integrity Act of 2026**\nThe Transparency & Integrity Act of 2026, introduced in the 117th U.S. Congress during its second session, aims to restore integrity in government through sweeping reforms. The bill establishes real-time disclosure of contributions over $200 within 48 hours, mandates beneficial ownership transparency for PACs, Super PACs, and nonprofits, and bans corporate and federal contractor donations. It introduces democracy vouchers of $200 per voter per cycle, caps individual contributions at $2,000, and guarantees media access for publicly funded candidates. Title III prohibits compensated influence activities\u2014including lobbying, access brokering, and strategic advisory services\u2014by individuals, corporations, or entities, with penalties including up to $10 million in civil fines, 10 years imprisonment, and permanent federal contracting bans. Indirect influence channels such as law firms, PR agencies, think tanks, and trade associations are also restricted. Permitted activities include private citizen communications, congressional testimony, journalism, academic research, whistleblower disclosures, and formal public comments. Title IV mandates criminal and financial background checks, 10 years of tax return disclosure, and psychological fitness evaluations for candidates. Title V creates a public contracting portal with real-time data and imposes a 10-year contracting ban on repeat violators. Title VI promotes electoral fairness through ranked-choice voting, independent redistricting commissions, and making federal election day a national holiday with universal mail-in ballots and paper audit trails. Title VII establishes the Independent Integrity Commission (IIC) with prosecutorial authority and automatic funding equal to 0.05% of federal discretionary spending. Title VIII mandates full congressional oversight of classified expenditures, requiring annual reporting to the Congressional Intelligence Committees and the GAO, prohibiting unaccounted funds, and authorizing annual audits. Violations of classified spending rules carry penalties including removal, fines, and up to 10 years in prison. Title IX introduces a mandatory Integrity Oath for all federal officeholders, requiring candidates to affirm that they will not knowingly make false statements or engage in deception, with consequences including immediate removal, permanent disqualification, $5 million civil penalties, up to 10 years imprisonment for violations causing harm, and forfeiture of pensions. The bill is grounded in constitutional authority under Article I, Sections 4 and 8, and takes effect on January 1, 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 03:22 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@fads-haycock-06/transparency-integrity-act-of-2026-3b7f0cdaf5eb)\n\n**US Congress approves release of Epstein files, set to send bill to Trump**\nThe U.S. Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, requiring the Department of Justice (DOJ) to release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials related to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s investigation and prosecution. The bill passed the House of Representatives 427-1 and was unanimously approved by the Senate, with the lone 'no' vote from Republican Representative Clay Higgins, who argued the bill could harm innocent individuals. The legislation mandates that the documents be made publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format, while allowing the DOJ to withhold information that could jeopardize active investigations or reveal victims\u2019 personal details. President Donald Trump, who initially dismissed the Epstein controversy as a 'hoax' and opposed the release, has stated he will sign the bill into law. The case has drawn national scrutiny due to Epstein\u2019s high-profile connections, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and Harvard University\u2019s former president Larry Summers, who recently apologized for his ties. Survivors, including Jena-Lisa Jones, who was 14 when she met Epstein, spoke publicly at the Capitol, calling for accountability. Trump\u2019s past comments, including calling a reporter 'piggy' on Air Force One, drew widespread criticism from media figures and family members, with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper calling the remarks 'disgusting and completely unacceptable' and Trump\u2019s niece Mary Trump labeling them 'wildly inappropriate and despicable'. The DOJ already has the authority to release the files without congressional approval.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 09:22 AM\nSource:[news24](https://www.news24.com/world/us-congress-approves-release-of-epstein-files-set-to-send-bill-to-trump-20251126-0562)\n\n**Patients' group presses Trump to take on health-care 'fat cats,' demand real price transparency**\nThe nonprofit patient advocacy group PatientsRightsAdvocate.org (PRA), led by founder Cynthia Fisher, is urging President Donald Trump to enhance healthcare price transparency by empowering patients, employers, and unions with full access to healthcare claims, payments, and fee details through the Department of Labor. Fisher emphasized that placing control of healthcare dollars in the hands of Americans\u2014not insurance companies or private equity 'fat cats'\u2014is essential for restoring fairness and accountability. She specifically called on Trump to support the Patients Deserve Price Tags Act, introduced by Senators Roger Marshall (R-KS) and John Hickenlooper (D-CO), which mandates hospitals to disclose actual prices for approximately 300 services and provide itemized bills. This effort builds on Trump\u2019s February executive order requiring the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments to enforce transparency rules, including uniform pricing across hospitals and insurers. Despite uncertainty over the release timeline of Trump\u2019s upcoming healthcare proposal\u2014potentially as early as November 25, 2025\u2014the issue remains a top White House priority. The push comes amid political negotiations over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, which expired in October 2025 and remain a point of contention. A September 2025 poll by Echelon Insights found that nearly 90% of U.S. voters support regulations requiring upfront disclosure of exact healthcare prices. Republican strategist David Kochel stated that implementing such transparency would be a 'game-changer' for the 2026 election, shifting the healthcare narrative and rebuilding public trust by addressing surprise medical bills and hidden pricing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/patients-group-presses-trump-take-health-care-fat-cats-demand-real-price-transparency)\n\n**FBI Strengthens Security at Epstein Archive Amid Conspiracy Theories and New Transparency Law**\nThe FBI has deployed armed agents to guard the Central Records Complex in Virginia, the facility housing two billion pages of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, due to heightened concerns over theft and sabotage. This move followed online speculation on Reddit and other social media platforms about protests and potential direct actions to access the files, including claims that politically sensitive names might be 'cleaned' from the documents. Some users questioned when protests would escalate into direct action. According to internal sources cited by Bloomberg, FBI agents typically based in Washington, D.C., were temporarily reassigned to Virginia to strengthen security. The 23,000-square-meter complex underwent a comprehensive review from March to May, during which FBI agents, FOIA officials, and internal verification staff applied nine exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act to determine what could be released. The documents, covering nearly two decades of federal investigations, include testimonies, prosecutorial records, classified materials, emails, internal communications, and grand jury materials. The review was initially concluded by Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI in summer 2025, who stated no further documents would be published. However, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act with 427 votes in favor and one against, mandating the Department of Justice to release all non-classified documents in digital, searchable format within 30 days. President Donald Trump signed the law on Wednesday. The law allows the government to withhold documents if their release could compromise ongoing investigations. Mark Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother, claimed in an interview with NewsNation that the files would be manipulated to remove 'Republican names,' citing an 'affordable source' and directly accusing the FBI director. Although no evidence supports this claim, the statement fueled conspiracy theories. The House Oversight Committee recently released thousands of emails from Epstein\u2019s personal archive, revealing contacts with both Republican and Democratic politicians, including Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. Epstein\u2019s emails included claims that he was 'the only one who could destroy them' and referenced Donald Trump. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent figure in the MAGA movement and a longtime proponent of Epstein-related conspiracy theories, announced she would not seek re-election in 2026. She had been a leading advocate for the transparency law and has long accused the government of censorship and interference. Her reasons for stepping down were not disclosed. On social media, Trump labeled Greene a 'traitor' and said she 'has gotten worse' since he stopped answering her endless calls.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 03:11 PM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/mondo/i_file_segreti_di_epstein_blindata_la_sede_archivio_fbi_alto_rischio_di_furto-9205073.html)\n\n**Government push to unseal court records offers clues about what could be in the Epstein files - The Boston Globe**\nThe U.S. Justice Department is pushing to unseal court records related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, complying with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump. The law mandates the public release of Epstein and Maxwell investigative materials in a searchable format by December 19, 2025. The Justice Department submitted a four-page filing listing 18 categories of material it seeks to release, including grand jury transcripts, police reports, photographs, and videos from investigations by the Palm Beach, Florida, police and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the mid-2000s. The department is coordinating with survivors and their lawyers to redact sensitive information, including identities and sexualized images. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in New York ordered the government to provide detailed descriptions of the materials to inform victims, as he did not preside over Maxwell\u2019s trial but was assigned the case after Judge Alison J. Nathan\u2019s elevation. Judge Richard M. Berman, overseeing Epstein\u2019s 2019 sex trafficking case, gave the department until Monday to submit detailed descriptions of the records it intends to make public. In August, both judges previously denied requests to unseal grand jury transcripts, ruling such disclosures are rarely permitted. The Justice Department is now arguing that the new law overrides prior restrictions. Tens of thousands of pages of Epstein-related records have already been released through civil lawsuits, Freedom of Information Act requests, and public disclosures. In 2024, a Florida judge released about 150 pages from a 2006 state grand jury investigation. Last week, the Justice Department moved to unseal federal grand jury transcripts from the same investigation, citing the new law.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 10:40 PM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/26/nation/epstein-maxwell-grand-jury-transcripts-justice-department/)\n\n**Major Press Outlets Side With GOA in Lawsuit Over ATF Records**\nMore than two dozen media outlets and journalism associations are supporting Gun Owners of America (GOA) in its lawsuit against the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) over the agency\u2019s inadvertent disclosure of documents during a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

CIPA, originally enacted in 1967 to prevent telephone wiretapping, has been repurposed to challenge digital tracking tools such as Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, and session replay software, with plaintiffs arguing these tools 'intercept' digital communications without consent. Courts have not definitively ruled on whether these tools violate CIPA, but many have allowed claims to proceed, exposing businesses to statutory damages of $5,000 per user. SB 690 passed the Senate but stalled in the Assembly Judiciary Committee due to competing priorities and the need for further discussion among privacy advocates, industry groups, and consumer-rights organizations. In the absence of reform, businesses face ongoing litigation risk, with plaintiffs filing frequent boilerplate lawsuits based on the use of common website tools. To mitigate risk, companies are advised to conduct comprehensive privacy audits, ensure affirmative opt-in consent via clear banners, update privacy disclosures in plain language, strengthen vendor agreements with privacy clauses, implement role-based data access controls, train internal teams on data practices, and review insurance coverage\u2014many of which exclude statutory privacy violations. Even successful defenses may result in reputational harm due to public framing of claims as 'consumer privacy' issues. Observers expect SB 690 or a similar bill to be reintroduced in the next session. Until then, CIPA compliance has become a cross-functional business imperative requiring proactive measures, transparency, and meticulous consent practices to avoid costly litigation and demonstrate good-faith compliance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[news.bloomberglaw.com](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/legal-exchange-insights-and-commentary/stalled-cipa-reform-leaves-businesses-to-face-compliance-alone)\n\n**US Congress approves release of Epstein files, set to send bill to Trump**\nThe U.S. Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, requiring the Department of Justice (DOJ) to release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials related to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s investigation and prosecution. The bill passed the House of Representatives 427-1 and was unanimously approved by the Senate, with the lone 'no' vote from Republican Representative Clay Higgins, who argued the bill could harm innocent individuals. The legislation mandates that the documents be made publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format, while allowing the DOJ to withhold information that could jeopardize active investigations or reveal victims\u2019 personal details. President Donald Trump, who initially dismissed the Epstein controversy as a 'hoax' and opposed the release, has stated he will sign the bill into law. The case has drawn national scrutiny due to Epstein\u2019s high-profile connections, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and Harvard University\u2019s former president Larry Summers, who recently apologized for his ties. Survivors, including Jena-Lisa Jones, who was 14 when she met Epstein, spoke publicly at the Capitol, calling for accountability. Trump\u2019s past comments, including calling a reporter 'piggy' on Air Force One, drew widespread criticism from media figures and family members, with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper calling the remarks 'disgusting and completely unacceptable' and Trump\u2019s niece Mary Trump labeling them 'wildly inappropriate and despicable'.

The law requires the U.S. Department of Justice to release records, documents, communications, and investigative materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell within 30 days, with exceptions allowed for politically sensitive, embarrassing, or reputationally damaging information. However, Attorney General Pam Bondi retains discretion to withhold records if they jeopardize active investigations, are classified for national defense or foreign policy, or constitute a 'clearly unwarranted' invasion of privacy involving victims\u2019 personally identifiable information, medical files, or similar data. Scott stated on November 25, 2025, that the law 'did not provide enough protections for victims and witnesses' and called for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to continue investigating the extent of the crimes and who was involved. The legislation has deepened tensions between Trump and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who announced her resignation effective January 5, 2026, citing Trump\u2019s hostility toward her after she pushed for the release of Epstein files. Greene said advocating for victims\u2014many of whom were raped at age 14\u2014should not result in being labeled a traitor or threatened by the president. The American Conservative warned that Bondi\u2019s broad privacy discretion could be abused to shield administration officials from scrutiny.

Fisher emphasized that placing control of healthcare dollars in the hands of Americans\u2014not insurance companies or private equity 'fat cats'\u2014is essential for restoring fairness and accountability. She specifically called on Trump to support the Patients Deserve Price Tags Act, introduced by Senators Roger Marshall (R-KS) and John Hickenlooper (D-CO), which mandates hospitals to disclose actual prices for approximately 300 services and provide itemized bills. This effort builds on Trump\u2019s February executive order requiring the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments to enforce transparency rules, including uniform pricing across hospitals and insurers. Despite uncertainty over the release timeline of Trump\u2019s upcoming healthcare proposal\u2014potentially as early as November 25, 2025\u2014the issue remains a top White House priority. The push comes amid political negotiations over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, which expired in October 2025 and remain a point of contention. A September 2025 poll by Echelon Insights found that nearly 90% of U.S. voters support regulations requiring upfront disclosure of exact healthcare prices. Republican strategist David Kochel stated that implementing such transparency would be a 'game-changer' for the 2026 election, shifting the healthcare narrative and rebuilding public trust by addressing surprise medical bills and hidden pricing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/patients-group-presses-trump-take-health-care-fat-cats-demand-real-price-transparency)\n\n**FBI Strengthens Security at Epstein Archive Amid Conspiracy Theories and New Transparency Law**\nThe FBI has deployed armed agents to guard the Central Records Complex in Virginia, the facility housing two billion pages of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, due to heightened concerns over theft and sabotage. This move followed online speculation on Reddit and other social media platforms about protests and potential direct actions to access the files, including claims that politically sensitive names might be 'cleaned' from the documents. Some users questioned when protests would escalate into direct action. According to internal sources cited by Bloomberg, FBI agents typically based in Washington, D.C., were temporarily reassigned to Virginia to strengthen security. The 23,000-square-meter complex underwent a comprehensive review from March to May, during which FBI agents, FOIA officials, and internal verification staff applied nine exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act to determine what could be released. The documents, covering nearly two decades of federal investigations, include testimonies, prosecutorial records, classified materials, emails, internal communications, and grand jury materials. The review was initially concluded by Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI in summer 2025, who stated no further documents would be published. However, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act with 427 votes in favor and one against, mandating the Department of Justice to release all non-classified documents in digital, searchable format within 30 days. President Donald Trump signed the law on Wednesday. The law allows the government to withhold documents if their release could compromise ongoing investigations. Mark Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother, claimed in an interview with NewsNation that the files would be manipulated to remove 'Republican names,' citing an 'affordable source' and directly accusing the FBI director. Although no evidence supports this claim, the statement fueled conspiracy theories. The House Oversight Committee recently released thousands of emails from Epstein\u2019s personal archive, revealing contacts with both Republican and Democratic politicians, including Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. Epstein\u2019s emails included claims that he was 'the only one who could destroy them' and referenced Donald Trump. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent figure in the MAGA movement and a longtime proponent of Epstein-related conspiracy theories, announced she would not seek re-election in 2026. She had been a leading advocate for the transparency law and has long accused the government of censorship and interference. Her reasons for stepping down were not disclosed. On social media, Trump labeled Greene a 'traitor' and said she 'has gotten worse' since he stopped answering her endless calls.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 03:11 PM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/mondo/i_file_segreti_di_epstein_blindata_la_sede_archivio_fbi_alto_rischio_di_furto-9205073.html)\n\n**U.S. Department of Justice Requests Lifting of Secrecy on Epstein Files Within 30 Days**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has requested a federal judge to lift confidentiality and remove protective orders related to the cases of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, following President Donald Trump's signing of the 'Epstein Files Transparency Act' on November 19, 2025. Under the law, Attorney General Pam Bondi is required to release all unclassified records, communications, and investigative materials related to Epstein within 30 days. Limited redactions are permitted only to protect victim privacy or ensure the integrity of ongoing investigations, and must be narrowly justified in the federal record. The Department of Justice urged the court to expedite the declassification of grand jury transcripts and discovery materials, arguing that Congress granted clear authority to disclose such information, overriding traditional federal criminal procedure rules and prior court decisions that denied disclosure. The judge in Maxwell\u2019s case set a timeline: Maxwell must submit her position by December 3, 2025, and the prosecution must notify victims entitled to submit statements by the same date. The prosecution has until December 10, 2025, to respond, with the final ruling pending. The law was passed by the House of Representatives with a 421-1 vote, with only Representative Clay Higgins (R-LA) opposing, warning the law could harm innocent individuals including witnesses and defense participants. The Senate passed it unanimously. The law's passage follows renewed public interest in Trump\u2019s past ties to Epstein, after the DOJ and FBI stated in July 2025 they would not lift secrecy due to case closure. The law mandates the release of all unclassified materials, including files involving individuals mentioned in prior cases, allegations of trafficking, internal communications, and details about Epstein\u2019s death. Redactions are allowed only for victim names, child sexual abuse content, classified information, or material that could compromise ongoing investigations. Bondi confirmed she would comply with the law by publishing searchable online records within 30 days. The announcement sparked significant interest among Trump supporters demanding disclosure of a purported 'client list' and details of Epstein\u2019s death. However, the emails and statements attributed to Epstein have not been proven true, contain no formal charges against Trump, and only include passing references to him. Trump has never been formally charged with any misconduct related to Epstein, and no law enforcement records indicate his involvement in Epstein\u2019s crimes. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking of minors. Maxwell was later convicted on similar charges and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 11:04 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5212568)\n\n**CPP Warns of Threat to Press Freedom from Proposed Law on Confidential Information Disclosure and Calls for 'Locks' to Protect Journalism**\nRodrigo Salazar Zimmermann, director ejecutivo del Consejo de la Prensa Peruana (CPP), warned that the Peruvian government's proposed legislative initiative to amend the Penal Code\u2014intended to criminalize the disclosure of 'confidential information' in criminal investigations and police operations\u2014poses a serious threat to press freedom. The proposal, part of an executive request for legislative powers over security, crime, economic growth, and institutional strengthening, is overly broad, potentially enabling prosecutors to target journalists under the pretext of handling 'confidential information.' Salazar emphasized that the law, as drafted, applies to public officials, prosecutors, and journalists alike, and could be weaponized to suppress investigative journalism. He urged Congress to correct the draft with clear safeguards, proposing a 'lock' or specific exemption to ensure the new offense does not apply to journalistic disclosures. He expressed concern that the law could create a 'protective shield' for the National Police amid rising urban insecurity, undermining media oversight. Although President Jos\u00e9 Boluarte claimed the reform would not restrict press work, Salazar noted that final decisions rest with prosecutors, who could use the broad penal tool to initiate investigations against journalists. He also referenced past attempts by previous governments, such as under Alberto Ot\u00e1rola during Dina Boluarte\u2019s administration, to restrict media activity through similar legislative measures during social protests.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 04:17 AM\nSource:[RPP noticias](https://rpp.pe/peru/actualidad/cpp-advierte-riesgo-en-proyecto-que-sanciona-la-difusion-de-informacion-reservada-y-pide-candados-para-proteger-labor-periodistica-noticia-1665191)\n\n**US President's July 2025 trip to Scotland materials: FOI release**\nUnder the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, the Scottish Government responded to a request for records related to Donald Trump\u2019s July 2025 trip to Scotland. The government confirmed it does not hold any historical records of Sean Connery\u2019s comments on Donald Trump or his businesses in Scotland. Regarding the 28 July 2025 meeting between Trump and First Minister John Swinney, and all engagements during Trump\u2019s trip, the Scottish Government provided most of the requested information but withheld parts under four exemptions. Section 30(b)(i) (free and frank provision of advice) applies, as disclosure would inhibit the confidential advice process between officials and Ministers. Section 30(b)(ii) (free and frank exchange of views) applies, as premature disclosure would undermine deliberative discussions on sensitive issues. Section 32(1)(a) (international relations) applies due to potential prejudice to UK\u2019s relations with other states. Section 33(1)(b) (commercial interests) applies, as disclosure could harm the commercial interests of public authorities and organizations. In each case, the public interest test was conducted, and in all instances, the public interest was found to favor upholding the exemptions, prioritizing confidential governance, effective decision-making, international diplomacy, and commercial protection over transparency.

The 2024 state budget included over $1 billion in earmarked funds, with $160 million allocated through the earmark process, including $10 million for a youth sports complex in Frankenmuth, $10 million for Potter Park Zoo in Lansing, $3 million for a solar array in Grand Rapids, and $3 million for a sports complex in Kent County. These allocations were often added late with vague language, enabling taxpayer money to be directed to private developers, campaign donors, and political interest groups without accountability. While the Democratic-controlled Senate passed a bill requiring public posting of earmark requests 10 days before final vote\u2014deemed insufficient by Hall\u2014Hall has refused to support expanding the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to cover the Legislature and governor, despite Michigan being one of only two states with such exemptions and receiving an 'F' in ethics and transparency rankings from the Center for Public Integrity.

The bill, if passed, would amend four existing laws, including the Information Act, and exclude assistant ministers\u2014appointed to all CLP backbenchers in October 2024\u2014from Freedom of Information (FOI) disclosure requirements, effectively treating their correspondence as non-government information for FOI purposes. The move follows a 2021 FOI request by the Environment Centre NT (ECNT) seeking internal communications related to the McArthur River Mine security bond reduction, which led to a protracted legal battle culminating in a 2022 appeal to the Information Commissioner and a 2025 Supreme Court case on whether ministers and senior staff are bound by FOI obligations. Boothby described the bill as containing 'minor changes' and aimed at ending 'the era of green lawfare,' citing significant taxpayer costs from defending the former Labor government\u2019s denial. The ECNT criticized the legislation as exceeding the scope of the original legal challenge. The bill is now in a 28-day consultation period before final parliamentary consideration. FOI laws are critical to democratic transparency, enabling public access to government documents despite limited media access to internal communications. The NT proposal comes amid broader federal efforts to restrict FOI access, drawing condemnation from integrity, human rights, and media freedom advocates, who describe such moves as a 'grave integrity failure' and a threat to accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:53 AM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-27/nt-government-changes-freedom-of-information-foi-laws-explained/105929520)\n\n**Sierra Club Releases Nearly 1,000 New Emails from Trump's EPA**\nThe Sierra Club released 952 pages of emails obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, revealing communications between EPA officials and external organizations during the Trump administration.

Specific correspondence includes Toyota\u2019s request for a meeting with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in early February 2025 (pp. 230\u2013231), Ford\u2019s senior executive meeting with EPA officials (pp. 750\u2013752), and coordinated sign-on letters from the American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers supporting the waiver nullification (pp. 104\u2013111). The American Gas Association also requested meetings to discuss 'critical energy priorities' (pp. 25\u201327). Emails further document industry lobbying on PFAS and PFOA protections, including Chemours\u2019 communications about discharges at its West Virginia plant (pp. 137\u2013198), the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s advocacy (pp. 678\u2013684), and industry groups from the paper and pulp sector (pp. 756\u2013787) and the American Chemistry Council (pp. 841, 874\u2013877). Andrea Issod, senior attorney at the Sierra Club\u2019s Environmental Law Program, stated the records expose corporate polluters and lobbyists influencing the EPA to weaken life-saving environmental regulations. The Sierra Club has also filed lawsuits against the Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of the Interior over withheld records. The organization anticipates receiving additional batches of documents from these agencies.

According to the Associated Press, in 2013 Obama signed an amendment to the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, commonly known as the Smith\u2011Mundt Act. The amendment lifted restrictions that previously barred the domestic dissemination of material produced by the U.S. Agency for Global Media (UAGM), the agency that runs Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The change allows Americans to request and access UAGM content, but it does not permit the agency to create programming specifically for U.S. audiences or market it to them. The article cites Gabe Rottman, director of the Reporters Committee\u2019s Technology and Press Freedom Project, who explained that \"Even upon request, if I wanted to get it through FOIA, for instance, they couldn't do it. The amendment changed that.\" It also quotes Weston Sager, an attorney, who said the previous law created a \"de facto ban on the domestic dissemination of materials originating from the State Department.\" Emily Metzgar, professor at Indiana University, noted that the original 1948 ban was intended to protect the nascent U.S. broadcast industry, not to shield the public from propaganda. The article reports that the UAGM operates with an annual budget of $805\u202fmillion and oversees five media networks that reach millions abroad. The claim that Obama \"repealed a ban on government propaganda\" is therefore false, as the amendment only eased restrictions on access, not on the creation or marketing of content to U.S. audiences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 03:17 PM\nSource:[AP NEWS](https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-7064410002)\n\n**Is The Government About To Put A Price On The Truth? Labor Proposes Changes To Freedom Of Information Laws**\nThe Albanese government has introduced a bill that would greatly expand its power to withhold government documents, a move critics say undermines decades\u2011old transparency standards.  Attorney\u2011General Michelle Rowland presented the proposal to parliament, arguing that the current Freedom of Information (FOI) laws are \"broken\" and waste too much public\u2011service time on \"frivolous\" requests, citing an example of a request for departmental staff desktop backgrounds.  The bill would allow public servants to issue blanket refusals to act on FOI requests from journalists, advocacy groups or members of the public if processing the request takes more than 40 hours \u2013 a threshold that amounts to one day of work for a small team.  It would also introduce a fee for lodging non\u2011personal FOI applications, with the fee likely set between $30 and $58, ban anonymous requests, and expand exemptions around cabinet and deliberative documents.  Personal requests for an individual\u2019s own records would remain free.  Shadow Attorney\u2011General Julian Leeser called the move a \"truth tax,\" warning that the new fees would further restrict access to information in the public interest.  The Greens also criticised the proposal, warning of major setbacks to transparency.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected claims that his government was retreating from transparency commitments, saying that anonymous FOI requests could allow foreign actors to obtain sensitive information.  Rowland said the reforms would enable public servants to focus on \"genuine\" requests and spend taxpayers\u2019 money more expeditiously, noting that public servants spent \"more than a million hours processing FOI requests\" in 2023\u201124.  The Centre for Public Integrity condemned the bill as \"a retrograde step,\" and the prior Senate inquiry had recommended greater use of proactive disclosure to allow agencies to release personal information directly to citizens without FOI processes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 02:21 AM\nSource:[B&T](https://www.bandt.com.au/is-the-government-about-to-put-a-price-on-the-truth-labor-proposes-changes-to-freedom-of-information-laws/)\n\n**Yes, freedom of information laws need updating, but not like the government is proposing**\nMaria O'Sullivan argues that Australia\u2019s Freedom of Information (FOI) laws require modernization but the government's FOI Amendment Bill threatens transparency.

It would also introduce a mandatory fee of roughly $30\u2011$50 per request, with an exemption for requests about the requester themselves, to curb vexatious requests. Rowland said the changes would 'continue to promote transparency in government while ensuring public sector resources are not unduly misused by anonymous or vexatious requests.' Public servants reportedly spent more than a million hours processing FOI requests in 2023\u201124, including spam, threats and 'frivolous' requests; a single entity sent 580 requests in a short window, diverting a team for over three months.

    "summary": "All experts converge on a very low probability that either chamber of Congress will approve legislation in 2025 that partially or fully exempts any major executive branch department, the CIA, or the EPA from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Across legal, political science, legislative affairs, public administration, and governance perspectives, the experts agree that the historical base rate for such exemptions is extremely low. The recent legislative trend, including the overwhelming passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, underscores strong bipartisan momentum towards increased transparency rather than heightened secrecy. Additional factors suppressing the likelihood include robust press and civil society opposition, high electoral and reputational costs for lawmakers, and the lack of any pending or advancing bills with exemption language as of late November 2025. While some mention possible tail-risk scenarios\u2014such as a high-profile security breach prompting a late-emerging emergency exemption, or a stealth amendment tacked onto a must-pass bill\u2014there is no direct evidence of such movements in either chamber. Minor regulatory rollbacks at the agency level (e.g., EPA's changes to expedited FOIA processing) do not meet the resolution criteria and have been pursued as regulatory, not statutory, changes. Final probability estimates among forecasters cluster between 2% and 6%, with consensus that the outcome is highly improbable absent an extraordinary, last-minute event.",
