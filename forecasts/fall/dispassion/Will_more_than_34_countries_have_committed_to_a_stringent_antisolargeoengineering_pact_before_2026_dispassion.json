You correctly highlight the extreme stringency of the required commitments and the very low base rate for rapid multilateral adoption of new restrictive environmental treaties\u2014especially where the five detailed bans far exceed current voluntary or soft-law approaches. Your reasoning is firmly grounded in the practical realities of international treaty processes, where even incremental treaties require years of negotiation and ratification, and where current climate diplomacy is struggling with much less controversial measures. While your probability (2%) is slightly higher than the strict modal consensus, it is still within a reasonable range for an outcome that is not absolutely impossible but is exceedingly unlikely in the absence of a dramatic, catalyzing event. Your scenario analysis and attention to both procedural and political barriers make your reasoning robust from an international law standpoint."

The evidence from COP30 and the persistent inability to forge binding commitments even on less divisive issues reinforce your point that the current system is predisposed to partial, piecemeal, or voluntary arrangements. By noting the 'bar for this question is much higher' and highlighting commercial and strategic counter-pressures, your reasoning aligns with EU environmental policy analysis, which recognizes the limits of normative leadership when broader regime alignment is absent.

The scenario where 35+ countries commit to all five stringent prohibitions in under a month would require not just norm emergence, but immediate translation into binding law\u2014a process for which there is no precedent in this policy domain. The continued advances by commercial actors, lack of crisis or scandal, and visible inertia at COP30 all reinforce the dominance of the status quo.

Furthermore, norm diffusion is particularly slow on issues with high scientific uncertainty, powerful countervailing interests, and significant sovereignty concerns\u2014all of which apply here. The fact that even voluntary, non-binding measures have failed to gain broad traction (as shown by COP30 outcomes) suggests the stickiness of the status quo is being underestimated.

The news shows only incremental norm development, while commercial actors and great powers are still actively pursuing geoengineering options. Most analogous treaties (e.g., CFC bans, test bans) required years of gestation after much more acute, visible threats.

The news shows no focusing event, and key states are openly divided or ambivalent; commercial interest in geoengineering is rising, not falling.

The group decided to sustain the production cuts for the first quarter of 2026, continuing the historic cooperation agreement initially signed on December 10, 2016, and reaffirmed in subsequent meetings. The alliance also confirmed the framework of the 2019 Cooperation Charter and tasked OPEC\u2019s Secretariat with developing a plan to implement its objectives, to be presented at the 41st ministerial meeting scheduled for June 7, 2026. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) was empowered to conduct bi-monthly assessments of global oil markets, production levels, and compliance with the agreement, with authority to convene additional meetings or call an emergency ministerial session if market conditions demand. OPEC+ members approved the Secretariat\u2019s mechanism for evaluating the sustainable maximum production capacity (SMPC) of participating countries, which will serve as the baseline for determining production quotas starting in 2027. This move aims to align quotas with actual production capabilities, particularly amid challenges such as increased capacity claims by members like the UAE, declining output in some African nations refusing to reduce quotas, and Angola\u2019s exit from the alliance in 2024 over quota disputes. Despite rising supply\u2014especially from the Americas\u2014global oil prices have declined by 15% this year, with Brent crude trading near $63 per barrel by November 28, 2025, due to oversupply and slower demand growth. The International Energy Agency forecasts a record supply surplus in 2026. The alliance\u2019s decision comes amid renewed U.S. diplomatic efforts to mediate a Russia-Ukraine peace deal, which could ease sanctions on Russian oil and increase global supply if realized.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[https://www.alanba.com.kw/newspaper/](https://www.alanba.com.kw/1335045)\n\n**Russia and OPEC+ to Suspend Oil Production Growth in 2026 - Rossiyskaya Gazeta**\nEight OPEC+ countries, including Russia, will not increase oil production until the end of 2026, with December 2025 being the final month for the group to raise output by 137,000 barrels per day, fully exiting additional voluntary production cuts. The decision was confirmed in a joint communique following an online meeting on November 30, 2025. The participating countries are Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Oman, and Russia. Russia will increase production by 41,000 barrels per day in December, reaching a total of 9.57 million barrels per day, with no outstanding obligations to compensate for previously exceeded quotas. The alliance reaffirmed its commitment to the 2016 Cooperation Declaration, maintaining the agreed total production ceiling through December 31, 2026. A new mechanism developed by the OPEC secretariat will determine maximum production capacities for member states, forming the basis for setting baseline production levels for 2027. After a period of strict production cuts, OPEC+ countries began increasing output from April 2025, boosting exports and reclaiming market share from competitors such as the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Guyana, which expanded production during the period of OPEC+ cuts. Despite earlier attempts to stabilize oil prices through supply restrictions, global market share for OPEC+ members declined by nearly 1% in 2024. From April to December 2025, production increases were 137,000 bpd in April, 411,000 bpd monthly from May to July, 548,000 bpd in August and September, and 137,000 bpd in October, November, and December. Originally, the exit from voluntary cuts was scheduled for September 2026, but it was completed by October 2025. The group will now phase out the initial 1.6 million bpd voluntary cut, with an additional 1.21 million bpd expected to be added to the market by January 2026.

The process faces challenges due to the United States\u2019 hostile stance under President Donald Trump, who previously labeled climate change 'the greatest scam ever perpetrated on the world' and 'a hoax created by malicious actors' at the UN General Assembly. In contrast, France is committed to upholding the Paris Agreement goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. French Minister of Ecological Transition Monique Barbut opened the meeting on December 1, 2025. The format is unprecedented: gathering all 'lead authors' of the report in one location, aiming to produce a globally authoritative assessment of planetary climate disruption. The last IPCC report, published in March 2023, indicated the world was on track to exceed the 1.5\u00b0C warming threshold above pre-industrial levels by the early 2030s, with scientists now warning this limit may be breached before 2030. The IPCC operates by consensus, meaning any country can block approval of the report. A French government official noted the surprise at the U.S. administration\u2019s claims, emphasizing that IPCC members are leading scientists with PhDs. A key point of contention is the report\u2019s timeline: the 'High Ambition Coalition' (including EU nations and vulnerable Global South countries) advocates for a 2028 release to align with the 2028 global stocktake under the Paris Agreement, while emerging and fossil fuel-producing nations push for a 2029 deadline. Previous meetings, including one in Lima in October 2025, failed to resolve this divide. This reflects broader tensions seen at COP30 in Belem, Brazil, where agreement on phasing out fossil fuels was elusive. Despite these challenges, IPCC Chair Jim Skea stated in March 2025 that the IPCC is 'not in crisis,' and the Saint-Denis meeting is seen as a test of that claim.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 02:50 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/86HQ49F)\n\n**OPEC+ Decides to Maintain Production Levels, Approves Mechanism for Evaluating Output Capacity from 2027 Onward**\nThe OPEC+ alliance, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC oil-producing nations, agreed at its November 30 meeting to maintain crude oil production levels for the first and fourth quarters of 2026. The group also approved a new mechanism to evaluate the maximum production capacity of its member countries, which will be used to set production baseline standards starting in 2027. This framework will enable each member nation to establish its own production targets based on the evaluated capacity. Amid growing concerns over global oil oversupply, OPEC+\u2014which controls about half of the world\u2019s crude output\u2014has slowed its efforts to regain market share. The potential for a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, currently mediated by the United States, could lead to eased sanctions on Russia and increased oil supply if realized. Conversely, a failed agreement may result in intensified sanctions and further supply constraints. On November 28, Brent crude futures closed at just under $63 per barrel, marking a 15% decline since the start of the year. Jorge Le\u00f3n, former OPEC official and head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, stated that OPEC\u2019s decision sent a clear message: 'In a rapidly deteriorating market outlook, stability has been prioritized over ambition.' OPEC+ has been maintaining a daily output reduction of approximately 3.24 million barrels, equivalent to about 3% of global demand. This reduction consists of a 2 million barrel-per-day cut by the majority of member countries through the end of 2026, and an additional 1.24 million barrel-per-day cut due to a slowdown in the increase rate by eight participating countries starting in October 2025.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 12:29 AM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/world/2025/12/580176.php)\n\n**OPEC+ Agrees to Maintain Oil Production Cuts Through End of 2026**\nThe OPEC+ alliance reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining current oil production levels through December 31, 2026, during a virtual meeting held on November 30, 2025.

A formal application for the project must be submitted to the Major Projects Office by July 1, 2026. The agreement also paves the way for additional pipelines beyond the Trans Mountain expansion. Alberta will be exempt from federal clean electricity regulations (set to take effect in 2035) and the federal emissions cap, in exchange for increasing its industrial carbon price to at least $130 per tonne by April 1, 2026, though the exact implementation date remains under negotiation. The agreement links the pipeline to the Pathways Alliance carbon capture project, requiring both to be developed in tandem. Ottawa and Alberta will identify new emissions-reduction projects by April 1, 2026, and commit to a 75% reduction in methane emissions by 2035 (compared to 2014 levels), a shift from the previous 2030 target. Alberta will also develop a nuclear generation strategy by January 2027 to meet growing electricity demand, particularly for AI data centres. While the agreement is framed as a step toward energy independence and industrial transformation, it has drawn criticism: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called it a delay tactic, while NDP MP Gord Johns labeled it 'insulting' and 'archaic,' arguing it undermines Indigenous relationships and coastal environmental concerns. B.C. Premier David Eby acknowledged differences but confirmed trilateral talks would proceed. The agreement is seen as a strategic move to attract investment and counter Alberta\u2019s separatist sentiment, with Smith stating that federal-provincial cooperation fosters trust.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 01:42 AM\nSource:[westernwheel.ca](https://www.westernwheel.ca/alberta-news/carney-smith-sign-pipeline-deal-open-door-to-changing-bc-tanker-ban-11548667)\n\n**COP30: World Continues to Take Action on Climate**\nThe 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, marked the 10-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement and demonstrated continued global momentum on climate action despite geopolitical challenges and internal disagreements. Countries, companies, and civil society organizations reaffirmed commitments to transition to a fossil fuel\u2013free, climate-resilient economy. Key outcomes included 120 countries announcing new 2035 climate targets\u2014representing around 75% of global emissions\u2014showing stronger ambition toward net zero by midcentury. Over 86 countries supported launching a fossil fuel phaseout road map, with the COP30 presidency committing to host the first ministerial meeting on this effort in April 2026. COP30 established the Just Transition Mechanism to support equitable shifts to low-carbon economies, recognizing labor and Indigenous rights. India announced its new NDC would be released in December 2025, having already achieved its 50% fossil-free power capacity goal five years early, with 256 gigawatts (GW) of fossil-free capacity. South Korea committed to shutting down all 61 of its coal-fired power plants by 2040. On finance, countries agreed to a new goal to at least triple adaptation finance by 2035, building on the 2025 baseline; if previous goals are met, this implies at least $120 billion annually by 2035. The Baku to Belem Roadmap to $1.3 trillion by 2035 was acknowledged, though no formal tracking mechanism was created. The Adaptation Fund received $135 million in new pledges from 10 countries, falling short of its $300 billion target, while the Loss and Damage Fund reached over $800 million in pledges and launched its first funding call with $250 million allocated for 2025\u20132026. COP30 advanced adaptation resilience through the adoption of a revised set of 100 adaptation indicators, though contentious negotiations led to objections from many nations, with work continuing into 2026. The Fostering Investable National Planning and Implementation (FINI) for Adaptation and Resilience collaborative was launched, uniting over 100 organizations to scale up adaptation investments. Forest protection gained focus with the launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which received $6.5 billion in pledges\u2014far below the $25 billion public target needed to unlock $100 billion in private investment. A coalition of 92 countries pledged to advance a clear 2030 deforestation halt plan. The road ahead requires scaling climate finance to $200 billion annually from rich countries and $650 billion total by 2028, tripling renewable energy capacity, doubling grid investments, and finalizing global road maps for fossil fuel phaseout and forest protection. Despite shortcomings, COP30 reinforced global resolve to accelerate climate action.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[nrdc.org](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/yamide-dagnet/cop30-world-continues-take-action-climate)\n\n**The 'Possible Agreement' of COP30: Navigating a New Geopolitical Reality**\nThe 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) concluded on Saturday, November 25, 2025, with a final agreement described by experts as modest but significant due to the achievement of consensus amid heightened geopolitical fragmentation. While the accord fell short of ambitious goals\u2014particularly the absence of a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels, which was supported by over 80 countries, and a commitment to halt deforestation, backed by over 90 nations\u2014participants acknowledged that reaching any agreement was a major achievement. Angela Lucas, cofounder of the Land fund and consultant at the Catholic University, called it 'the possible agreement,' emphasizing that failure to reach consensus would have severely weakened the climate negotiation framework. Filipe Duarte Santos, president of the National Council for Environment and Sustainable Development (CNADS), noted that while the outcome lacked ambition, it was preferable to no agreement at all. The 'Global Implementation Accelerator,' a two-year initiative led by the current and future COP presidencies, aims to close the gap toward the 1.5\u00b0C target and establish clear pathways for fossil fuel phase-out and deforestation reversal. Parallel efforts include the 'Bel\u00e9m Transition Compass' and the Bel\u00e9m Declaration, led by Colombia and the Netherlands, which brought together 24 countries committed to advancing the phase-out of fossil fuels, with a global conference scheduled for April 2026 in Colombia. The agreement also includes a commitment to triple adaptation funding by 2035. Despite intense late-night negotiations, with the European Union facing internal divisions and isolation due to lack of unity, the final text was approved amid accusations of opacity from Latin American countries. Experts like Bianca Chinelli from the Portuguese Institute of International Relations highlight that the shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world order\u2014led by the EU, BRICS, and other actors\u2014has made multilateral agreements more complex. Nevertheless, progress is evident: global CO\u2082 emissions growth has slowed from nearly 2% annually in 2015 to around 0.3%, and projections for global temperature rise have improved from 4\u00b0C to between 2.1\u00b0C and 2.5\u00b0C by 2100, assuming full implementation of national climate plans. As of now, 122 countries have submitted updated plans covering approximately 75% of global emissions. The consensus itself is seen as a crucial step in preserving the credibility of international climate cooperation.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 04:40 PM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/11/25/o-acordo-possivel-da-cop-que-nasce-da-nova-dinamica-geopolitica/)\n\n**COP30 ends with a whimper**\nThe 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change concluded in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, with a weak and symbolic outcome, described as ending 'with a whimper.' The summit was marked by disruptions including torrential rains, floods, and a fire that forced evacuations\u2014events likened by climate scientist Michael Mann to a 'disturbingly apt metaphor' for the talks' ineffectiveness. The UN's 'Emissions Gap' report confirmed that global temperatures are on track to exceed 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels within the next five years, rendering the original Paris Agreement goal unattainable and shifting focus toward 'global cooling' strategies such as carbon removal and solar geoengineering. While a formal framework for measuring climate resilience was adopted and rich nations agreed to triple adaptation funding to developing countries by 2035, experts like Natalie Unterstell of Talanoa noted the lack of baseline figures undermines accountability. The most significant failure was the removal of all references to fossil fuels from the final agreement, despite a 2023 pledge in Dubai to phase them out. Opposition from oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia, Russia, and India, along with threats from the EU, UK, and Pacific island states, failed to restore the language. Related proposals for a deforestation roadmap and more frequent updates to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) were also dropped. Nevertheless, positive developments included the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), a $125 billion fund to pay countries for preserving tropical forests. China, absent due to the U.S. not sending a delegation under Donald Trump, avoided leadership and opposed provisions on critical minerals. Brazil promoted the concept of 'mutir\u00e3o'\u2014a collective effort\u2014to frame cooperation, though the Paris Agreement's success relied on voluntary commitments, a dynamic now strained by the lack of binding mechanisms in Bel\u00e9m.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 04:43 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/cop30-ends-with-a-whimper-101763959120046.html)\n\n**Countries Adopt Watered-Down Climate Pact at COP30 in Brazil to Showcase 'Unity'**\nAt the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, nearly 200 countries reached a consensus on a more moderate climate agreement to maintain unity, despite the absence of U.S. President Trump. The agreement, adopted after two weeks of intense negotiations in the Amazon rainforest region, avoided strong language on phasing out fossil fuels, instead referencing prior commitments and proposing a voluntary 'roadmap' for gradual elimination. COP30 President Lago acknowledged differing expectations, stating that the roadmap was a compromise. While Brazil\u2019s President Lula hailed the outcome as a victory for multilateralism, European officials admitted they accepted the diluted deal to prevent total collapse. China\u2019s Deputy Minister of Ecology and Environment, Li Gao, called the outcome a success, emphasizing international unity. The Small Island States Alliance noted the agreement was imperfect but necessary under consensus-based processes. A major achievement was the commitment to at least double climate adaptation funding for developing countries by 2035, though representatives from Bangladesh and Nepal said it fell short. Colombia\u2019s President Petro rejected the deal, announcing plans for a global fossil fuel phase-out summit in April 2026. The event was marked by dramatic moments: a fire broke out in the conference hall, indigenous protesters clashed with security, and torrential rain and high humidity disrupted proceedings. Despite political tensions and opposition from oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia and coal-dependent India, Brazil\u2019s role as a developing nation advocate was seen as significant. The agreement also included stronger language on trade measures, marking a notable shift compared to past climate summits held in tightly controlled authoritarian states. The atmosphere was vibrant, with mass street protests and a festive energy, though the outcome was seen by many as a compromise rather than a breakthrough.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 02:48 AM\nSource:[\u6771\u65b9\u7db2 \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u6771\u65b9\u65e5\u5831](https://www.orientaldaily.com.my/news/international/2025/11/23/778074)\n\n**Denial, geopolitics hurt climate cooperation this year: UN climate chief**\nAt the conclusion of the UN COP30 summit in Belem, Brazil, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell attributed setbacks in global climate cooperation to 'denial, division, and geopolitics,' emphasizing that while progress was hindered, international resolve remains strong. Despite the absence of a formal fossil fuel phase-out roadmap, the summit achieved significant outcomes: a commitment to triple adaptation finance, a new agreement on a just transition ensuring equitable benefits from the clean economy, and a political and market signal that the shift to renewables is irreversible. Stiell noted that investment in renewables now exceeds fossil fuels, and over 400 million people have become more climate-resilient. A total of $1 trillion has been committed for clean grids, and hundreds of millions of hectares of forest, land, and ocean have been protected or restored. Stiell criticized disinformation for distorting the political landscape and exploiting climate-induced anxiety, but affirmed that 194 countries united in solidarity, affirming the Paris Agreement's effectiveness and committing to accelerate national climate plans. He referenced the Brazilian indigenous term 'Mutirao' to emphasize collective action. The summit, originally scheduled for November 10\u201321, was extended due to a major fire at the main venue on November 20. UNFCCC President Andre Correa do Lago announced a new document on fossil fuels may be released by October 2026, pending further data. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C and pursue efforts to cap it at 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels (1850\u20131900). Developing countries require $310\u2013365 billion annually by 2035 for adaptation, but current funding is only $26 billion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 01:32 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/denial-geopolitics-hurt-climate-cooperation-this-year-un-climate-chief-125112300048_1.html)\n\n**The Electric Pact: Can It Deliver a Future Without Blackouts?**\nThe Electric Pact, signed in 2021, introduced over 100 measures aimed at reforming the Dominican Republic's electricity sector, including gradual tariff adjustments to cost levels, targeted subsidies, reduction of distribution losses, promotion of renewable energy, and integrated planning. Despite its ambitious framework, four years later, results remain mixed. Edward Veras, Director of the National Energy Commission (CNE), emphasized that the Pact reestablished the CNE\u2019s planning role, leading to the development of a National Energy Plan (2022\u20132036), updated in 2024 to 2038, which is now under public consultation. The plan aims to double the country\u2019s installed electrical capacity and GDP by 2036, with a focus on renewable energy and natural gas. Key projects underway include a second liquefied natural gas terminal in Manzanillo and a 60% expansion of the Boca Chica terminal, enabling new gas-fired combined cycle plants. The updated plan also emphasizes energy storage\u2014such as large-scale batteries and pumped hydroelectric storage\u2014to address renewable intermittency, a significant improvement over past plans. As of 2025, renewable energy accounts for 25% of national generation, nearing the 30% target by 2030 set by Law 57-07 and climate commitments. Additionally, over 22,000 households have installed solar panels since 2019, contributing around 4% of national demand. The government is also modernizing distribution through smart metering, reducing subsidies, and exploring private-sector partnerships under strict accountability. Despite progress, challenges persist: delayed project implementation, historically recurring gaps in execution, and outdated contractual negotiations. Experts like Jose Luis Moreno San Juan of UASD stress that while past plans failed due to lack of continuity, the current consensus and regularly updated long-term strategy offer cautious optimism. Both officials and independent analysts agree that sustained, transparent, and consistent execution\u2014beyond political cycles\u2014is essential to eliminate blackouts and achieve a reliable, modern electricity system. 'The minimum is 20 years of forward-looking planning,' Moreno stated, underscoring that only long-term commitment can end the era of power outages.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 04:07 AM\nSource:[Listin diario](https://listindiario.com/la-republica/20251117/pacto-electrico-esperanza-futuro-apagones_882556.html)\n\n**Vietnam commits to a world free of nuclear testing: Ambassador**\nAmbassador Vu Le Thai Hoang, Vietnam's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and other international organizations in Vienna, reaffirmed Vietnam's strong support for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), calling it an 'important pillar of the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime.' Speaking at the 65th session of the Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO in Vienna from November 10\u201312, 2025, Hoang emphasized Vietnam's commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy under strict adherence to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards. Vietnam, set to chair the 11th Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT RevCon 2026) in New York, pledged to promote balance, build consensus, and link NPT processes with complementary mechanisms like the CTBT. The ambassador noted Vietnam\u2019s upcoming consultation with regional groups in Vienna on November 24\u201325, 2025, and highlighted CTBTO Executive Secretary Robert Floyd\u2019s visit to Vietnam in August 2025, which included participation in an East Asia regional workshop on National Data Centres (NDC) hosted by the Ministry of Science and Technology. This visit enhanced Vietnam\u2019s technical capacity and advanced regional cooperation in CTBT monitoring and verification. Hoang warned that reductions in CTBTO budgets could disrupt technical support, training, and capacity-building programmes, especially for developing countries, urging that cost-saving measures not compromise these essential activities. He stressed Vietnam\u2019s commitment to close coordination with the CTBTO and member states to promote multilateralism, ensure geographic balance, increase participation of women and youth, and advance the shared goal of a world free of nuclear testing. The session reviewed reports on treaty implementation, the International Monitoring System (IMS), the Global Communications Infrastructure (GCI), the International Data Centre (IDC), and budget and governance issues. CTBTO Executive Secretary Floyd emphasized the need for continued international commitment to prevent nuclear testing amid a complex geopolitical landscape and great power competition. The session also reviewed the CTBTO\u2019s 2026\u20132027 programme and budget, adjusted to increase efficiency and minimize costs while prioritizing resources to sustain the IMS and enhance IDC data analysis. Floyd cautioned that budget cuts or delays could increase operational risks for the IMS, compromise data quality, and limit future responsiveness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 09:32 AM\nSource:[VietNamNet News](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/vietnam-commits-to-a-world-free-of-nuclear-testing-ambassador-2461742.html)\n\n**The Paris Agreement at 10: Has the World Delivered on Climate Promises?**\nTen years after the Paris Climate Agreement was adopted in December 2015, global progress toward limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C remains insufficient. Despite 140 countries committing to net-zero emissions by 2050 and the EU pledging a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. According to a Guardian survey, about 80% of climate experts expect global warming to reach at least 2.5\u00b0C, with nearly half anticipating 3\u00b0C or more, while only 6% believe the 1.5\u00b0C target is still achievable. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms that the last decade was the hottest on record, with heatwaves now five to ten times more likely than in 2015. Although non-fossil energy expansion avoided 9.8 GtCO2e in 2024, as reported by 'Nature', emissions must decline by 42% by 2030 and 57% by 2035 to meet the 1.5\u00b0C goal. The UNFCCC\u2019s 2025 NDC Synthesis Report analyzed 64 new national climate plans, revealing a remaining emissions gap of 26.6 to 29.9 GtCO2e. The Green Climate Fund mobilized over $13.6 billion in 2023 for climate adaptation in developing nations, yet fossil fuel projects still receive disproportionate funding. Geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have driven up energy prices, exacerbating climate vulnerability\u2014especially for small island nations like Fiji, where rising sea levels threaten survival.

The agreement could allow Pakistan\u2019s nuclear umbrella to extend to Riyadh, potentially sparking a regional arms race that has alarmed India, which views the pact as a direct challenge. Israel and Iran are expected to reassess their defensive postures in a Middle East seeking new strategic autonomy.\n\nIn the Indo\u2011Pacific, Russia and China intensified military cooperation, with warships operating increasingly near Japanese territorial waters. Japan responded by stationing combat jets at NATO bases for the first time, marking a historic expansion of trans\u2011Atlantic cooperation.

The reports set out a coordinated agenda for the next few years, stressing that the window of opportunity closes by summer\u202f2026 when France will be focused on the 2027 presidential election. The priorities identified are: 1) defence \u2013 the war in Ukraine has shown that Europe must invest in both basic equipment and cutting\u2011edge technologies such as autonomous drones, space systems and hypersonic weapons. 2) productivity and innovation \u2013 the EU lags behind the US and China, especially in artificial intelligence. The authors propose a Franco\u2011German DARPA to fund breakthrough research, a joint AI gigafactory with more than 100\u202f000 processors, a fund to democratise access to science and entrepreneurship, and a \u201828th regime\u2019 to create a single European innovation market. 3) energy \u2013 France relies on nuclear, Germany on renewables; the reports call for joint auction systems, a bilateral council of governments and network operators, and a shared hydrogen research programme. 4) labour market \u2013 the two countries must tackle structural weaknesses: better training for French youth, reduce women\u2019s under\u2011employment in Germany, extend senior activity and give a second chance to low\u2011skilled workers. 5) China relations \u2013 a selective opening that protects strategic sectors (defence, space, robotics), allows consumer imports from mature sectors, and attracts Chinese investment in lagging areas such as batteries, provided technology transfer is secured.

    "summary": "Across all expert analyses, the probability that more than 34 countries will have committed to a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact before 2026 is assessed as extremely low. Experts from climate policy, international law, environmental policy, international relations, and political science converge in their reasoning, highlighting several core factors. The stringency of the required treaty\u2014necessitating comprehensive bans on research, deployment, funding, patents, and international opposition\u2014makes consensus highly unlikely. Historically, creating and ratifying new, restrictive multilateral environmental agreements is a slow process, often taking years or decades, especially on controversial and emergent technologies. Recent international climate negotiations (notably COP30) have struggled to achieve even minimal, non-binding commitments, signaling deep geopolitical fragmentation and lack of momentum for ambitious global governance. Major powers (US, China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia) are either interested in retaining geoengineering as a strategic or technological option or have shown little inclination to embrace sweeping new prohibitions. The rising commercial and military interest in solar geoengineering, exemplified by companies like Stardust, further incentivizes states to keep research avenues open. Although certain blocs (the EU, some climate-vulnerable states) and civil society actors advocate for a ban, these efforts have not translated into binding, large-scale treaties. Experts generally consider the only plausible scenario for a rapid agreement to be a high-impact, catalyzing event (e.g., a disastrous geoengineering experiment), but note there is no current indication of such an occurrence or a resulting diplomatic breakthrough. Estimated probabilities from all experts range from 1% to a high of 7%, with most at 1-2%. The consensus is that the status quo\u2014fragmented, non-binding, and incremental governance\u2014will persist, and the threshold of 35 committed countries with comprehensive obligations will not be met before the 2026 deadline.",
