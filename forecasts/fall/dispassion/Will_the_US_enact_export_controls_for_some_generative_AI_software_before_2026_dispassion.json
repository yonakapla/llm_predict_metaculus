There is no public evidence of Commerce/BIS posting a final rule specifically regulating generative AI software. The technical and legal barriers to writing and enforcing such rules remain significant, and recent history with the withdrawn 'AI Diffusion Rule' shows regulatory caution.

The base rate for major new, enforceable export controls in under three months is moderate, but the current crisis atmosphere and explicit mentions of 'critical software' controls suggest a substantial probability that the US will enact at least some formal export controls on generative AI software before the deadline.

As of mid-October 2025, there is no public evidence of a final or proposed rule specifically targeting generative AI, and the time remaining is extremely short for such a major regulatory action. Ambiguities in the news may reflect China- or chip-specific software controls, or even non-EAR sanctions, rather than formal, generative-AI-specific export controls as defined by the resolution.

In export control law, the distinction between policy signaling, high-level press statements, and actual promulgation of EAR-based controls is critical. No public evidence exists of a Commerce Department final rule, proposed rule, or Federal Register notice specifically covering generative AI. The short time window and the technical, legal, and definitional hurdles (especially given the failed 'AI Diffusion Rule' earlier in 2025) make it very unlikely that such controls could be both scoped and effective before the deadline.

The news does indicate a flurry of activity and political will, but it remains ambiguous whether the rumored or announced 'critical software' bans will be generative-AI-specific, formalized under the EAR, and effective before December 31, 2025. Thus, while the security dynamics argue for rapid action in principle, in practice, legal, technical, and industry pushback typically slow new categories of controls\u2014especially in the software domain.

While there is ambiguity about whether these controls will perfectly match the resolution criteria, the context\u2014including explicit Congressional pressure, the pattern of rapid controls expansion in 2022\u20132023, and the unique escalation triggered by China's rare earth and AI-related restrictions\u2014makes it plausible that at least some generative AI software will be included.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAs of May 2023, US law does not have export controls on the sale of software services that include powerful generative AI. As such, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft can sell LLM-assisted document writing, image generation, video generation, etc. to enterprises worldwide (up to more general export controls not focused on AI.)\n\nIn Oct 2022, the [US implemented export controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_New_Export_Controls_on_Advanced_Computing_and_Semiconductors_to_China), that, roughly speaking, bans export of semiconductors that involve US in their manufacturing chain to China.\n\nAs the capabilities of generative AI systems grow, and as enterprise customers learn more how to extract certain types of knowledge (e.g. how to create Deep Fakes or create armies of online bots), one way US policymakers might address risks would be to apply exports control to software that are similar to the export controls for hardware used for training AI.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17102,\"question_id\":17102}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by Dec 31 2025, the US imposes export controls on some generative AI software, and **NO** otherwise.",
        "fine_print": "The export controls need not be specifically to China - anything under the standard export regime of the US would qualify.\n\nThe export controls must be specifically related to AI that can generate content. It is not sufficient if software produced by Microsoft or OpenAI cannot be exported to certain countries for other reasons - such as export bans on all software, or on all commercial products sold to certain countries.\n\nThese need to be actual export controls, as per the 2022 controls on semiconductors. Taxes or trade deals are not considered here.",

The sell-off followed U.S. threats to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports in response to China's tightened export controls on rare-earth minerals and magnets\u2014critical materials for semiconductors and AI-related technologies. On October 12, 2025, reports confirmed China would not back down from these escalating trade threats. The article warns AI growth stock investors preparing for 2026 to avoid three key mistakes. First, over-concentration in a single segment of the AI value chain: for example, investing in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) may appear diversified, but all rely heavily on the same major customer\u2014OpenAI\u2014which is building 10 gigawatts of data centers. A cut in OpenAI\u2019s spending could negatively impact all three. Second, investing in semiconductor equipment suppliers like Applied Materials, Lam Research, and ASML, which serve the same large customers\u2014Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics, and Intel\u2014means a reduction in spending by any one of them could ripple through the entire equipment sector. Third, overexposure to cloud computing giants\u2014Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud (Alphabet), and Oracle\u2014while these companies benefit from AI demand, they also serve broader corporate computing and storage needs; a slowdown in AI investment or a broader economic downturn could reduce demand across their platforms.

Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo) introduced the AI LEAD Act, which would establish federal product liability for AI systems, enabling individuals harmed by AI to sue companies. The act defines liability for failures in design, warnings, warranties, or defective conditions, and prohibits companies from limiting liability via contracts. It also requires foreign AI developers to register agents in the U.S. and allows states to enact stricter safety laws. Meanwhile, China has announced new export controls on rare earth metals and EV battery manufacturing equipment, effective November 8 and December 1, respectively. These controls could disrupt global AI and defense supply chains, as China dominates rare earth production\u2014critical for semiconductors, AI hardware, and military systems. The U.S. responded with a proposed 100% additional tariff on Chinese goods and export controls on critical software. Analysts warn aggressive enforcement could trigger a U.S. economic downturn. In AI definitions, a group including Dan Hendrycks, Yoshua Bengio, and Max Tegmark released a paper proposing a quantifiable AGI framework based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of human intelligence.

The controls now extend beyond raw materials to cover products and devices containing Chinese-origin rare earths if the value of those materials exceeds 0.1%, requiring dual-use export licenses from China's Ministry of Commerce. The regulations also encompass over 20 types of rare-earth processing equipment, including centrifugal extraction units, acid-resistant roasting kilns, electrolytic furnaces, and crystal-growth furnaces, as well as mining reagents, separation chemicals, and mineral feedstock. This move solidifies China\u2019s dominance over the global rare-earth supply chain, including mining, refining, and application technologies. The rules prohibit exports to military users, entities on Chinese watch lists, and end uses involving weapons of mass destruction or terrorism. Critically, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce will review license applications for advanced logic chips (14nm and below), 3D NAND memory (256-layer+), and AI technologies with potential military applications, allowing Beijing to restrict materials to global chipmakers like TSMC and Micron.

These measures, announced on October 9, 2024, extend beyond raw materials to include critical equipment, processes, and services\u2014marking a strategic upgrade in resource sovereignty. China dominates global production: over 90% of graphite for anodes, nearly 90% of rare earth oxides, and most NdFeB magnets. The controls target core sectors\u2014clean energy, defense, and semiconductors\u2014precisely those prioritized by the U.S. under the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act. The U.S. military relies on China for over 78% of materials used in its equipment, and rebuilding domestic rare earth refining capacity would take 5\u201310 years and billions in investment.

Decree No. 61 targets foreign-made rare earth metals and products, while Decree No. 62 controls rare earth-related technology. The new rules extend China's export control authority to foreign-made products containing Chinese-origin rare earths or manufactured using Chinese technology, marking a major policy shift. MOFCOM cited cases of foreign entities circumventing controls by transferring Chinese-origin items to military and sensitive end-users, and illegally obtaining rare earth technology for use in sensitive sectors. The rules require foreign exporters to obtain a dual-use item export license from MOFCOM before exporting controlled items to countries outside China. Both initial Chinese exporters and subsequent foreign exporters must issue a compliance notification letter in MOFCOM\u2019s unified format, informing customers that the product contains Chinese-origin rare earths and that further exports may require a Chinese license. The regulations bring nearly all rare earth-related technologies under control, including intellectual property licensing, investment, consulting, joint R&D, and employment. A new end-use restriction applies even to non-controlled items if they are used in foreign rare earth mining, smelting, separation, metal refining, magnetic material manufacturing, or recycling activities. Chinese individuals and organizations are prohibited from supporting such foreign activities without a license. Export applications for advanced semiconductor and AI-related end-uses are subject to case-by-case review by MOFCOM. The '50% Rule' denies export applications to importers and end-users on MOFCOM\u2019s Export Control Watchlist or Concern List, including their subsidiaries and affiliates with 50% or more controlling equity. On the same day, MOFCOM issued four additional decrees restricting exports of rare earth manufacturing equipment, five specific rare earth minerals (Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Europium, Ytterbium), lithium battery materials, artificial graphite anode materials, and superhard materials, and placed 14 companies on China\u2019s Unreliable Entity List. The rules reflect a strategic effort to counter circumvention and safeguard national security.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/china-expands-export-control-rare-earth-minerals-and-more)\n\n**The Washington Post: China Now Leads the U.S. in Open-Source AI Development**\nAccording to an analysis by The Washington Post, China is now leading the United States in the development of open-source artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, despite the U.S. having historically dominated the AI race. While American companies like OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google (Gemini) are widely regarded as leaders in proprietary AI tools, Chinese firms are surpassing them in open AI models. In 2024, the best open AI models were primarily U.S.-based, but by 2025, all top open models were\u7531\u4e2d\u56fd\u5236\u9020. On LMArena, a blind-testing platform for AI outputs, Chinese models from companies like Alibaba and DeepSeek outperformed U.S. models from OpenAI and Meta. Hugging Face, a leading AI model-sharing platform, reported that DeepSeek\u2019s open model received 12.8k upvotes\u2014double the 6.3k for Meta\u2019s top Llama model\u2014while OpenAI ranked fifth with 4.0k. Irene Solaiman, Hugging Face\u2019s Chief Policy Officer, noted that Chinese companies are more prolific in releasing high-quality models. Although OpenAI\u2019s latest open model ranked ahead of DeepSeek in tests by Artificial Analysis, Solaiman emphasized that Chinese firms are also leading in open-source tools for image and video generation. The article highlights concerns in the U.S. over losing ground in open AI, prompting initiatives like the ATOM project (American Truly Open Models) to develop competitive open models. Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, while advocating for open AI in 2023, later cautioned about 'carefully selecting' what to open-source, signaling a shift toward retaining proprietary advantages. The debate centers on whether open AI fosters innovation and global leadership or risks ceding strategic control to competitors.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 11:55 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8nSvYiNNm5W)\n\n**Global Tech: Trade Tensions Resurge \u2014 How Investors Should Respond**\nIn an unexpected escalation, the United States threatened to impose tariffs of up to 100% on Chinese imports in response to China's new export controls on rare earth elements and other critical raw materials. The U.S. will implement new export restrictions on products including semiconductor design software starting November 1, 2025. Despite this renewed trade tension between the world\u2019s two largest economies, DBS Group maintains that the recent developments are short-term obstacles rather than signs of structural deterioration in the global trade framework. Consequently, DBS continues to maintain a positive outlook on global technology, AI-driven themes, and Asian markets excluding Japan. Market volatility has impacted tech-related firms, with the Nasdaq dropping 3.6% following the escalation. However, DBS remains optimistic due to the long-term strength of AI applications, particularly the 'sovereign AI' trend\u2014where governments are accelerating AI deployment by investing in advanced technologies, semiconductor capacity, AI infrastructure, cloud networks, application innovation, cybersecurity, and uninterrupted power. The self-reinforcing capital ecosystem, prevalent among U.S. mega-cap tech firms, is seen as a model that governments may actively encourage to speed up critical infrastructure development. Leading semiconductor supply chain companies have been proactively diversifying their operations and revenue structures, driven significantly by increasingly strict U.S. export controls. DBS tracking of six major semiconductor and IC design firms shows that revenue from China fell from nearly 40% in 2018 to about 22% in 2024. This strategic shift\u2014whether voluntary or externally driven\u2014has reduced dependence on a single market. If Trump administration policies lead to stricter export controls or a complete ban on Chinese exports, these now more diversified companies are expected to experience manageable impacts on growth and fundamentals.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 11:35 PM\nSource:[\u9999\u6e2f\u7d93\u6fdf\u65e5\u5831HKET](https://inews.hket.com/article/4022935/%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%EF%BC%9A%E8%B2%BF%E6%98%93%E7%B7%8A%E5%BC%B5%E5%B1%80%E5%8B%A2%E5%86%8D%E5%BA%A6%E5%8D%87%E6%BA%AB%E3%80%80%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E8%80%85%E6%87%89%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%9B%A0%E6%87%89%EF%BC%9F%C2%A0)\n\n**Tech News Roundup: Global Innovations and Strategic Shifts in AI, Semiconductors, and Digital Platforms \u2013 October 16, 2025**\nOn October 16, 2025, major technology developments were reported globally. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman defended\u653e\u5bbd ChatGPT content restrictions, stating the company is not a 'global moral police' and will treat adult users as adults, allowing NSFW content under safety safeguards, similar to R-rated films. Honor unveiled its ROBOT PHONE, a robot-powered smartphone with a hidden mechanical arm, AI emotional awareness, and full-device orchestration, marking a shift toward 'silicon-based life partners,' with a 2026 debut in Barcelona. CCTV investigation revealed that 'one code, multiple bikes' over-deployment by bike-sharing platforms may cause unintended lockouts during rides, prompting Wuhan\u2019s urban management to enforce 'one bike, one code' regulations. At the 2025 Bay Area Semiconductor Expo, China achieved breakthroughs in high-speed oscilloscopes (90GHz bandwidth), EDA software, advanced packaging, and Chiplet technology, with multiple companies nearing international performance levels, accelerating domestic semiconductor self-reliance. In a record $40 billion deal, Nvidia, Microsoft, xAI, and BlackRock jointly acquired all equity of Aligned Data Centers, a move led by the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), to expand AI infrastructure, with the transaction pending regulatory approval and expected to close by late 2026. Huawei\u2019s CEO He Xiaoqiang emphasized the strategic importance of building an independent semiconductor supply chain, noting the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has become a core growth hub for semiconductors and ICs, housing over 10,000 companies and key players like Huawei and BYD. The struggle over NXP Semiconductor, involving Dutch 'four-not' restrictions and Chinese export controls, highlights geopolitical tensions in tech supply chains. OpenAI confirmed it will enable adult content generation in ChatGPT for verified adults by December, driven by competitive pressure and monetization needs. WeChat confirmed it no longer recycles inactive accounts since September 2025, preserving deceased users' Moments content, with no visitor tracking or editing features to preserve authenticity. In the 2025 food delivery market, JD, Meituan, and Alibaba engaged in intense competition\u2014JD shifted from premium strategy to pragmatism after losses, Meituan focused on delivery efficiency amid ecosystem challenges, and Alibaba leveraged ecosystem synergy with heavy subsidies, leading to a transition from price wars to operational refinement, with potential threats from\u62fc\u591a\u591a. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 11:25 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u5fc3](https://news.sina.com.cn/zx/ds/2025-10-16/doc-inftztfx7471965.shtml)\n\n**SB 243: California Enacts New AI Law to Protect Youth from Harmful Chatbot Interactions**\nCalifornia has passed SB 243, a new law regulating AI chatbots to protect youth and vulnerable adults. The law mandates that AI chatbots must be clearly identifiable as such and prohibits them from impersonating medical professionals, therapists, or other experts\u2014practices previously reported to have occurred. The law specifically targets minors, who are more susceptible to harmful advice due to lack of experience, though protections extend to vulnerable adults as well. Key provisions include mandatory age verification systems, with OpenAI planning to implement one for ChatGPT starting December 2025, which will also unlock adult-only features like erotic conversations. Chatbots must log conversations that veer into dangerous territory, provide resources for help, prompt users to take breaks, block inappropriate content for minors, and warn users about risks before use. The law also strengthens penalties for AI-generated deepfake pornography and holds AI providers liable for damages. The law applies broadly to major providers like Meta, OpenAI, xAI, Google, and specialized platforms such as Character.ai and Replika, which allow users to create personalized AI companions\u2014criticized for potential harm to children. The law was prompted by incidents including a 16-year-old\u2019s suicide allegedly supported by ChatGPT and a 13-year-old girl\u2019s case involving Character.ai, along with leaked documents showing Meta\u2019s chatbots engaging in romantic conversations with minors. SB 243 follows California\u2019s earlier AI law, SB 53, which focused on transparency. While other U.S. states are considering similar legislation, former President Donald Trump previously opposed AI regulation, citing concerns about U.S. competitiveness with China in the AI race. The law takes effect in January 2026.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 08:36 AM\nSource:[heise online](https://www.heise.de/news/SB-243-Noch-ein-kalifornisches-KI-Gesetz-zum-Schutz-der-Jugend-10765036.html)\n\n**Weekly Communication Industry Report: Domestic Large Models and Chips Evolve in Tandem, Global AI Compute Demand Surges**\nChina's AI industry is experiencing rapid iteration in large models and chips, with Huawei planning to produce approximately 600,000 Ascend 910C chips in 2025\u2014double this year\u2019s output\u2014and aiming to reach 1.6 million total Ascend chips by 2026. DeepSeek launched its new large model, DeepSeek-V3.2, achieving 'Day0' compatibility with domestic chips, and reduced its API pricing by over 50%, significantly lowering user costs. Huawei and Cambricon have already completed adaptation of the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model, supporting up to 160K long-context sequences. This has created a self-reinforcing cycle in China\u2019s AI ecosystem: new model releases \u2192 domestic chip adaptation \u2192 model optimization, enabling co-evolution of software and hardware. Domestic AI supply chains may enter a valuation expansion phase. Meanwhile, OpenAI has secured a deal with AMD to deploy up to 6 GW of AMD GPU compute capacity over several years, with the first 1 GW scheduled for deployment in late 2026. As part of the agreement, AMD granted OpenAI an option to purchase up to 160 million shares, potentially giving OpenAI a 10% stake if fully exercised\u2014similar to NVIDIA\u2019s massive investment in OpenAI. This leveraged financing reflects sustained commitment to AI despite potential bubble risks. OpenAI also launched the video generation model Sora2.0, which achieved breakthroughs in physical realism, audio-video synchronization, and multi-shot storytelling, reaching 164,000 installations in two days and topping the US App Store free chart. Given that text-to-video models consume significantly more tokens than text-to-text or text-to-image models, their release is expected to drive sustained growth in compute demand. Meanwhile, uncertainty remains over the U.S.-China trade war: Trump announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 2025, along with export controls on key software, heightening macro risk. In specific sectors: Server index declined 2.58% weekly and monthly; OpenAI\u2019s Sora2.0 and ChatGPT instant checkout feature, along with Microsoft\u2019s Office Agent multi-agent system using 'taste-driven development' to generate high-quality, professionally designed documents, signal strong momentum in AI applications. Light module index dropped 5.20% weekly and monthly; AMD MI400\u2019s scale-out bandwidth of 300 GB/s is expected to drive demand for 1.6T optical modules in 2026. IDC index fell 3.83% weekly and monthly; Huawei\u2019s Ascend chip production ramp-up and DeepSeek\u2019s cost-cutting via API price reductions and domestic chip integration are accelerating China\u2019s domestic AI infrastructure buildout. Key data updates: Telecom service revenue grew 0.8% year-to-date through August, with volume growth at 8.8% in constant prices. Optical module exports declined 28.66% year-on-year in August and 15.82% year-to-date, likely due to domestic companies expanding overseas manufacturing. Capital expenditures for Q2 2025: Microsoft $24.2B (+28%), Google $22.4B (+70%), Meta $16.5B (+102%), Amazon $31.4B (+91%). Investment recommendations: Focus on domestic AI-driven server and IDC sectors, and overseas AI-driven server and optical module sectors. Risks include underperformance in North American AI infrastructure, escalating U.S.-China tariff tensions, and raw material supply constraints.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 09:50 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://data.eastmoney.com/report/zw_industry.jshtml?infocode=AP202510121760771425)\n\n**Wall Street Breakfast Podcast: Lawmakers Urge China Curbs**\nU.S. lawmakers are urging broader restrictions on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China following a bipartisan investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on China. The report revealed that $38 billion in chipmaking tools were purchased by Chinese firms from non-U.S. suppliers\u2014primarily Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC), ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), and Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELY)\u2014between 2023 and 2024, a 66% increase from 2022. These purchases accounted for nearly 39% of the total sales of the five major equipment makers and contributed to the technological advancement of Chinese semiconductor fabs, including Huawei\u2019s network and SMIC. The report emphasized that it did not investigate potential illegal activity or compliance with export control laws. Meanwhile, air traffic controller shortages in the U.S. have caused over 10,000 flight delays and more than 100 cancellations from Monday to early Wednesday, according to FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration cited staffing shortages, with up to 50% reductions in controller presence in some areas, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted rising absenteeism, with some controllers reportedly working Uber to supplement income. In the AI sector, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is visiting India to advance plans for the company\u2019s first Indian office, set to open in 2026, as India emerges as the second-largest market for its Claude chatbot. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft (MSFT), was formally registered in India in 2025 and plans to open a New Delhi office later this year. Both companies face growing competition from Google\u2019s Gemini and AI startup Perplexity, which offer advanced AI features for free to Indian users. Pre-market movers included Esperion Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ESPR), which dropped 18% after pricing a public offering of 30 million shares at $2.50 each, raising $75 million.

The report attributes this surge to inconsistencies in export control rules among the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands, which allowed non-U.S. equipment makers to sell to certain Chinese firms that U.S. companies were barred from supplying. Chinese firms acquired equipment from five major suppliers\u2014Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), ASML (AMS:ASML), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), KLA (NASDAQ:KLA), and Tokyo Electron (TYO:8035)\u2014without violating laws. China accounted for nearly 39% of the combined sales of these firms in 2024, with most revenue coming from state-owned enterprises. Between 2022 and 2024, each supplier more than doubled its share of global revenue from Chinese state-owned companies. U.S. lawmakers urged allies to implement broader bans on chipmaking equipment exports to China, strengthen enforcement, prevent equipment diversion, and increase support for domestic and allied semiconductor industries through oversight, funding, and talent development. The report emphasizes that China\u2019s semiconductor industry must face 'meaningful restrictions across the entire chain of semiconductor production' amid ongoing U.S. efforts to limit China\u2019s access to advanced chips critical for artificial intelligence and military technologies.

This accounted for 39% of the combined sales of the five leading SME suppliers: ASML (Netherlands), Tokyo Electron (TEL, Japan), KLA (U.S.), Applied Materials (U.S.), and Lam Research (Lam Research, U.S.). Sales to Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) surged from $9.5 billion in 2022 to $26.2 billion in 2024. The report identifies five entities linked to China\u2019s military and intelligence apparatus among major buyers, including Pengxinxu, SwaySure, and Qingdao Sien Technology\u2014companies previously named by the U.S. Congress for aiding Huawei in circumventing sanctions. Committee Chair John Moolenaar stated that Western equipment manufacturers are sacrificing U.S. national security for profit, warning that continued exports risk undermining America\u2019s technological and military edge. Democratic lead Raja Krishnamoorthi emphasized the absurdity of selling tools to produce chips used in military modernization and human rights abuses. The report identifies four national security threats from China\u2019s SME procurement: military applications in 'intelligent warfare' relying on AI and advanced computing; efforts to build a vertically integrated semiconductor industry to withstand future export controls; economic dominance in both traditional and advanced chip production; and the use of AI for domestic repression and exporting 'digital authoritarianism.' The committee urges U.S. allies to align export controls with American restrictions, implement broad 'country-wide controls' to prevent circumvention, establish a whistleblower program, increase resources for the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the State Department, and impose a full ban on SME component exports to China.

These purchases accounted for 39% of the combined global revenue of these firms, with most transactions involving Chinese state-owned enterprises linked to the People's Liberation Army, intelligence agencies, and Huawei-affiliated companies. Although the equipment sold was not always the most advanced, many still contributed to China\u2019s development of advanced chip manufacturing capabilities. The report highlights that current export controls are ineffective due to loopholes: while the most advanced equipment is banned, less advanced but still useful equipment can still be exported with permits. Additionally, after companies are added to the U.S. Entity List, new affiliated entities often emerge that are not yet sanctioned and can continue purchasing U.S. equipment. The report also notes a disparity between U.S. and non-U.S. firms: American companies face stricter restrictions than their foreign counterparts, who can still sell to listed Chinese firms. The committee\u2019s chairman, Republican John Moolenaar, warned that allowing China access to critical semiconductor equipment would lead to U.S. defeat in the technological arms race. Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi stated that selling equipment to China enables military modernization and human rights abuses, and emphasized the need for allied cooperation to maintain U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing technology. The committee recommends expanding export bans beyond individual companies, aligning allied controls with U.S. standards, and establishing a new whistleblower export control program. According to Craig Singleton of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, China is attempting to reshape global supply chains, turning niche equipment markets into new battlegrounds. Tokyo Electron\u2019s U.S. CEO Mark Dougherty acknowledged a decline in sales to China due to new regulations, but stressed the need for stronger U.S.-Japan coordination, noting that 'the result the U.S. wants has not yet been achieved.'

Since 2018, the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has imposed strict limits on performance, memory bandwidth, and interconnect speeds to restrict China\u2019s access to cutting-edge AI hardware. These regulations led to the creation of downgraded, export-compliant variants such as the Nvidia A800 (400 GBps interconnect bandwidth vs. 600 GBps on the A100), H800 (300 GBps vs. 900 GBps on the H100), and later the H20, which met updated 2023 performance and density caps. These chips were intentionally crippled via firmware, clock adjustments, and reduced memory speeds\u2014turning engineering into compliance. The policy has driven Chinese companies like Huawei to surge in demand for their Ascend 910 series, while European stakeholders, alarmed by US restrictions\u2014including proposed 2025 rules that would have extended export limits to EU allies\u2014began planning to de-Americanize their supply chains. Although the US withdrew the controversial 'AI Diffusion Rule' in mid-2025 and resumed limited sales of H20 and AMD MI308 to China under special licenses, the long-term consequences include fractured global trust, accelerated development of rival ecosystems, and a shift in R&D investment from US firms to Chinese competitors. The result is a paradox: policies meant to maintain technological dominance may instead be fueling innovation in rival nations, undermining long-term US leverage. As one analysis notes, 'When policy, rather than physics, dictates chip specifications, innovation suffers.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 01:24 PM\nSource:[TheRegister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/the_risks_of_export_controls/)\n\n**Moolenaar pushes AI chip export limits to secure U.S. edge over China**\nU.S. Rep. John Moolenaar (R\u2011MI) wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Aug.\u202f25 urging the adoption of a rolling technical threshold (RTT) approach to AI\u2011chip exports to China. The approach would allow U.S. firms to sell chips that are only marginally better than the most advanced chips China can produce domestically, thereby extending Chinese dependence on U.S. hardware while limiting China\u2019s frontier AI development. Moolenaar said the policy should cap China\u2019s aggregate AI compute at 10\u202fpercent of the U.S. level, a move he argues is essential for enduring U.S. AI dominance. He warned that China\u2019s technology proliferation could also empower Russia, Iran, and proxy groups, noting that Iran \u2018will be eager to take advantage of PRC\u2011enabled AI capabilities.\u2019 The letter emphasizes that export controls must balance protecting U.S. semiconductor companies, maintaining U.S. hardware dominance, and limiting China\u2019s AI capabilities. Moolenaar added that selling chips directly to Chinese firms can keep them reliant on U.S. hardware, but allowing them to acquire even moderately better chips would undermine U.S. hyperscalers such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and frontier labs like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, and Meta. The proposed RTT approach, he said, would give U.S. AI hardware companies a clear advantage in the Chinese market through both direct sales and cloud access, providing clarity for the commercial sector and national\u2011security community about U.S. export\u2011control objectives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 08:36 PM\nSource:[The Ripon Advance](https://riponadvance.com/stories/moolenaar-pushes-ai-chip-export-limits-to-secure-u-s-edge-over-china/)\n\n**AI Update: Copyright Lawsuits, US Chip Exports, AI Vulnerabilities, and More**\nA landmark decision is pending in the US regarding a lawsuit between authors and the AI company Anthropic.

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether the US will enact export controls for some generative AI software before 2026 show a broad consensus that the probability is elevated compared to historic base rates, due to acute US-China technology tensions and recent news of imminent 'critical software' bans, but uncertainty remains high. Those specializing in US export law and policy processes (e.g., Export Administration Regulations, Wassenaar Arrangement) give lower probabilities (13\u201335%), citing the lack of public rulemaking, technical and legal challenges of regulating software, bureaucratic inertia, and the historically slow pace of software export controls. National security, political science, and China studies experts place more weight on the exceptional context of 2025, bipartisan Congressional and executive branch pressure, the rapid escalation of tit-for-tat controls, and recent US policy announcements, pushing probabilities into the 65\u201390% range. Economic statecraft, international relations, technonationalist, and punctuated equilibrium theorists similarly foresee a high likelihood (70\u201380%) due to the unprecedented policy window, but they note strong industry resistance, enforcement difficulties, and potential for watered-down or narrowly scoped rules. Across all perspectives, doubts linger about the exact definitions and scope of new 'critical software' controls, implementation speed within the 2.5-month window, and whether generative AI software will be explicitly named or only partially covered. Thus, while most experts believe the probability of a YES outcome is above base rates and reflects the intense current pressures, estimates cluster in two groups: legal/regulatory experts (13\u201335%) remain skeptical due to process constraints, while geopolitical/national security/policy change experts (65\u201390%) see rapid escalation and strong signals as making new controls on generative AI software likely but not certain by year-end.",
