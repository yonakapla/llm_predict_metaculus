The careful consideration of base rates, legislative bottlenecks, and the heightened threshold established by the resolution criteria demonstrates a nuanced, empirically grounded approach. By assigning a low but nonzero probability (7%), it avoids the pitfall of overconfidence or dismissing the possibility of a last-minute exogenous crisis, which\u2014while improbable\u2014cannot be discounted altogether in the volatile, high-profile AI sector. This calibration is methodologically sound and reflects both the letter and spirit of the question's requirements."

From a Science and Technology Studies (SCOT) viewpoint, I acknowledge that while interpretive flexibility and contestation can sometimes unpredictably accelerate or block policy closure, in the US context, they more often slow the process. The RIA approach rightly emphasizes regulatory precedent: even in domains with clearer externalities (e.g., data privacy, antitrust), comprehensive legislation has been stymied for years by entrenched interests and institutional inertia. The acute time constraint, absence of a focusing event, and continued reliance on executive/agency action further diminish the likelihood of legislative action in this window. Thus, the RIA's lower probability estimate is well-supported by empirical history and the structural realities of US policymaking. While SCOT highlights social contestation, the dominant effect in this instance is stasis, not surprise movement\u2014making a probability in the low single digits more justified."

This directly supports the Responsible Innovation stance that, in the absence of a galvanizing crisis or singular alignment of stakeholder interests, inertia and piecemeal executive action dominate. The forecast also correctly identifies that the short window, legislative gridlock, and ongoing lobbying yield a low, but not zero, probability: allowing for a tail risk event (e.g., a sudden AI-driven catastrophe) but not overstating its plausibility. This approach is methodologically sound and consistent with both the historical record and the resolution criteria. Its reasoning exemplifies how legal scholarship can integrate historical precedent, institutional analysis, and the dynamic political landscape to provide a nuanced, realistic forecast."

The original question opened on 2024-10-30 13:03:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/29076). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThis forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy: Will the US adopt federal AI regulations?\n\nIn the last few years, the speed of artificial intelligence (AI) development has increased exponentially and continues to become ever more sophisticated. [Many see AI as a solution to the current productivity crisis](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-will-ai-affect-productivity/), and it is in the midst of an \u2018[AI Boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom)\u2019, with global spending on AI expected to reach [$632 billion by 2028](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52530724), according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). \n\nThis has led to new and rapid advancements in the field. OpenAI, for example, the AI research organization behind ChatGPT, has launched its [\u2018Strawberry\u2019 AI model](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-launches-new-series-ai-models-solve-hard-problems-2024-09-12/), capable of \u2018reasoning\u2019 through tasks and problems rather than generating a quick response. Likewise, the technology giant NVIDIA \u2014 a dominant supplier of AI hardware and software \u2014 has released its own open-source AI model, [NVLM 1.0](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/nvidia-just-debuted-its-new-open-source-advanced-ai-model-with-state-of-the-art-capabilities-to-take-on-openais-magical-gpt-4o).\n\nWhile AI is therefore seen as an essential tool moving forward, there are also great concerns with the technology. There has been a marked increase in the use of AI to spread disinformation, with [fake images](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/business/media/ai-generated-images.html), [videos](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/artificial-intelligence-training-deepfake.html), and even [fake voice recordings](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68074257), designed to mimic politicians or celebrities, being widely propagated online, especially on [platforms such as X (formerly Twitter)](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/the-spread-of-synthetic-media-on-x/). AI is also being utilized for criminal purposes. Gangs in Asia, for instance, are [\u201c[l]everaging technological advances \u2026 to produc[e] larger scale and harder to detect fraud, money laundering, underground banking[,] and online scams\u201d](https://www.unodc.org/roseap/en/2024/10/cyberfraud-industry-expands-southeast-asia/story.html), according to Masood Karimipour, a regional representative of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). \n\nAs a result, there has been a push to regulate AI at the government level. The European Union (EU), for example, implemented the [Artificial Intelligence Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_Act) which came into force on 1 August 2024, establishing a common regulatory and legal framework for AI within the EU. Likewise, there has been a similar push to regulate AI at a federal level in the United States. In 2022, the White House released its \u2018[AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/)\u2019 and, in 2023, President Joe Biden signed [Executive Order 14110](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/), defining the administration\u2019s policy goals regarding AI and directing executive agencies to pursue them. Despite this, the [United States lacks any overarching federal regulation](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2024/04/existing-and-proposed-federal-ai-regulation-in-the-united-states), meaning AI in the US is currently governed by a mixture of federal and state law, the industry itself, and the judiciary.\n\nGiven that the pace of AI development continues to grow, the question arises as to whether the US government will adopt federal regulations for AI, or whether the [$146 billion industry](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/us-artificial-intelligence-market) will continue under its current patchwork regulatory regime.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":29076,\"question_id\":28996}}`",

The Case for Exponential Growth - Techopedia**\nDespite widespread skepticism in tech circles about the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, recent analysis by Anthropic researcher Julian Schrittwieser suggests that generative AI models like ChatGPT and Claude Sonnet are showing exponential growth in productivity, not stagnation. Two studies from METR and OpenAI indicate that models are making steady, accelerating progress toward human-level performance. Schrittwieser projects that by mid-2026, generative AI could operate autonomously for full eight-hour workdays, and by 2027, may surpass human experts in certain tasks. This trajectory, based on observed capability curves, contrasts with the linear expectations of critics. The article draws a parallel to early pandemic modeling, where exponential trends were underestimated due to flawed intuition. Financial indicators also challenge the 'bubble' narrative: unlike the dot-com era, today\u2019s AI investments are driven by profits from established firms funding infrastructure, with AI integration in back-office systems, developer tools, and workflow automation. Goldman Sachs notes that AI leaders\u2019 earnings forecasts are rising in tandem with valuations, unlike in 2000. Venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz describe AI demand as 'pull-driven' by enterprise needs, not speculation.

According to Morgan Stanley, global data centre spending is projected to reach nearly $3 trillion between 2024 and 2029. While Big Tech companies remain major investors, their cash flows from advertising and cloud services are insufficient to meet demand, prompting increased reliance on public and private credit. In August, Meta raised $29 billion, including $26 billion in debt, from private investors for data centres in Ohio and Louisiana. Debt is increasingly flowing to non-investment-grade borrowers such as CoreWeave, OpenAI, and smaller AI start-ups, with finance also sourced from other tech supply chain firms, creating interdependent financial exposures. OpenAI has announced over $1 trillion in computing deals with Nvidia, Oracle, CoreWeave, AMD, and Broadcom, some involving complex circular financing. This shift raises systemic financial risks: should generative AI fail to deliver on revenue promises, defaults could trigger cascading effects across banks and the highly leveraged non-bank sector. The IMF and Bank of England have warned that current tech valuations approach dotcom-era extremes, increasing the risk of a sharp equity correction impacting investment funds, pensions, and retail portfolios. The pressure to generate revenue is intensifying, despite ChatGPT reaching 800 million weekly active users\u2014broad business adoption remains slow.

Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, AI-related companies have seen explosive growth in valuations and investment, with OpenAI's value rising from $30 billion to nearly $500 billion and Anthropic's tripling in just six months\u2014from $60 billion to $170 billion. According to Goldman Sachs, AI-linked firms accounted for approximately 80% of the S&P 500's gains in 2025. Nvidia, a key supplier of AI chips, saw its market capitalization increase by over 220% in one year, reaching over $4 trillion\u2014making it the world\u2019s most valuable company, surpassing Amazon and Alphabet combined. The 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla) now represent over one-third of the S&P 500, compared to just 15% at the peak of the dotcom bubble in 2000. Mainstream financial institutions including the Bank of England, the IMF, and JP Morgan have raised alarms about a growing risk of a sharp market correction. Economist Torsten Slok of Apollo Global Management believes the current AI boom may exceed the dotcom bubble in scale, noting that the ten largest S&P 500 companies are now more overvalued relative to fundamentals than they were during the dotcom peak. Similarities include AI firms engaging in circular transactions, buying each other\u2019s products, and using supplier financing to sustain growth. James Anderson of Baillie Gifford stated, 'Just a few months ago I was surprised there were no signs of a bubble. Now they are too visible,' adding that the scale and speed of OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s valuations have deeply concerned him.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 09:32 PM\nSource:[Cyfrowa](https://cyfrowa.rp.pl/globalne-interesy/art43168451-ai-jak-dotcomy-eksperci-ostrzegaja-przed-banka-moze-ja-przekluc-pekin)\n\n**Rising Risks of an AI Funding Bubble**\nOpenAI announced deals worth over one trillion dollars this year to enhance computing power through partnerships with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD, CoreWeave, and Broadcom. Some agreements involve complex circular financing arrangements, raising significant economic and financial risks if generative AI fails to deliver on its promises. While initial concerns focused on stock market valuations, both the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England recently warned that technology valuations are nearing dot-com era highs, increasing the risk of a sharp global stock market correction that could impact investment funds, pension funds, and retail portfolios. The growing reliance on debt\u2014especially from lower-quality issuers\u2014exposes banks and high-leverage non-banking sectors to default risks. Circular financing deals amplify the danger of a domino effect. Generative AI faces mounting pressure to demonstrate revenue generation to justify today\u2019s massive investments and debt servicing. Although ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users and is widely used by consumers, broader corporate adoption of AI will take longer. The longer productivity gains are delayed across the economy, the higher the risk of financing retreat and default. Additional risks include rapid chip innovation making data centers obsolete faster than expected, and the rising cost of affordable electricity threatening sustainability. Some argue that even if AI expansion is overhyped, history shows such booms often leave behind useful infrastructure, as seen with 19th-century railroads or fiber-optic networks from the dot-com bubble. Cheap computational power could fuel the next wave of innovation. However, as credit, capital, and trust become increasingly intertwined, any failure could trigger a crisis far beyond stock valuations. Therefore, corporate discipline, investor scrutiny, and regulatory vigilance are now more critical than ever to ensure the sustainable continuation of the AI boom rather than its collapse.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/financial-times/690074)\n\n**Is AI Truly Worth the Hype, or Are We Heading Into Another Tech Bubble?**\nThe article examines whether the current AI boom is justified or if it signals another tech bubble, drawing parallels to past hype cycles like the dotcom era (1990s), cryptocurrency (2017\u20132022), and the metaverse (2021\u20132023). Each cycle began with genuine innovation but was followed by overhype, unrealistic expectations, and eventual correction. Today\u2019s AI boom is driven by breakthroughs from key players such as OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Generative AI tools are already delivering tangible value in healthcare (e.g., early cancer detection via image analysis), customer service (AI chatbots), education (personalized learning), agriculture (smart crop monitoring), finance (fraud detection), and everyday applications (face unlock, content recommendations). Despite these real-world impacts, concerns persist about overpromising: some products labeled 'AI-powered' are merely basic automation, and fears about AI autonomy and existential risk are exaggerated\u2014AI systems lack consciousness and operate solely on data patterns. Investment trends show a surge in funding, with NVIDIA reaching record highs and some AI startups valued at billions before launching a product, echoing the dotcom bubble. Economists warn of a 'mini bubble' forming, where speculation outpaces actual delivery. The article concludes that AI\u2019s long-term success depends on realistic expectations, ethical development, transparency, regulation, and public education. If guided by practical application and responsible innovation, AI can be a transformative tool; otherwise, it risks collapsing under its own hype. The article emphasizes that the outcome hinges on how society chooses to develop and deploy AI.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 07:35 PM\nSource:[DeFi Planet](https://defi-planet.com/2025/10/is-ai-truly-worth-the-hype-or-are-we-heading-into-another-tech-bubble/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=is-ai-truly-worth-the-hype-or-are-we-heading-into-another-tech-bubble)\n\n**What if AI Isn't a Bubble? The Case for Exponential Growth - Techopedia**\nDespite widespread skepticism in tech circles about the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, recent analysis by Anthropic researcher Julian Schrittwieser suggests that generative AI models like ChatGPT and Claude Sonnet are showing exponential growth in productivity, not stagnation. Two studies from METR and OpenAI indicate that models are making steady, accelerating progress toward human-level performance. Schrittwieser projects that by mid-2026, generative AI could operate autonomously for full eight-hour workdays, and by 2027, may surpass human experts in certain tasks. This trajectory, based on observed capability curves, contrasts with the linear expectations of critics. The article draws a parallel to early pandemic modeling, where exponential trends were underestimated due to flawed intuition. Financial indicators also challenge the 'bubble' narrative: unlike the dot-com era, today\u2019s AI investments are driven by profits from established firms funding infrastructure, with AI integration in back-office systems, developer tools, and workflow automation. Goldman Sachs notes that AI leaders\u2019 earnings forecasts are rising in tandem with valuations, unlike in 2000. Venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz describe AI demand as 'pull-driven' by enterprise needs, not speculation. Real-world case studies from Bain & Company, Workday, and others show measurable gains\u2014up to 20% in earnings for early adopters\u2014particularly in software development, compliance, fraud detection, and logistics. These benefits, though often hidden in earnings reports, are translating into tangible margin improvements.

Toronto School of Economics economist Joshua Gans noted that both companies and employees require time to learn how to effectively utilize new technologies. According to a preliminary speech by Bank of England (BOE) Governor Andrew Bailey on October 6, AI is poised to become the next General Purpose Technology (GPT), with applications across robotics, quantum computing, biotechnology, and other fields. The Indeed 9th-generation AI (GenAI) Skills Transformation Index showed that the number of human job skills highly likely to be fully replaced by GenAI rose from zero to 19 over the past year. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated in a Bloomberg TV interview on October 7 that the bank spends $2 billion annually on AI development and saves about $2 billion per year through AI-driven efficiency. JPMorgan Chase topped the fourth edition of the Evident AI Index, which evaluates 50 major banks across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific based on talent, innovation, leadership, and transparency. Morgan Stanley\u2019s global technology and operations head Mike Pizzi said in an interview that every business unit at the firm must annually cut projects due to budget constraints, but improved spending productivity could enable delivery of more products. A Financial Times report from August predicted that global data center spending will approach $3 trillion by 2029, with only $1.4 trillion coming from tech giants' capital expenditures. A joint study by Yale Budget Lab and Brookings Institution economists, reported by the Financial Times on October 1, found that ChatGPT\u2019s widespread adoption has not yet caused disruptive impacts on the U.S. labor market. KPMG\u2019s recent CEO Outlook Survey revealed that 67% of surveyed CEOs expect to see AI investment returns (ROI) within 1\u20133 years, up from 63% a year ago who expected returns within 3\u20135 years.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 03:38 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=489be0e3-9d91-4a58-a896-a9ec816387c0)\n\n**OpenAI and Broadcom Jointly Develop AI Chips with Power Consumption Five Times That of Hoover Dam**\nOpenAI has announced a partnership with Broadcom to develop its first in-house AI processors, aiming to secure computational capacity to meet growing demand for ChatGPT. OpenAI will lead chip design, while Broadcom will begin development and deployment from the second half of 2026, with full deployment expected by 2029. The custom chips will scale to 10 gigawatts (GW), consuming power roughly equivalent to over 8 million U.S. households or five times the output of the Hoover Dam. The project will fully adopt Broadcom's Ethernet and other networking equipment, directly challenging NVIDIA's InfiniBand network solutions. Analysts note that while the initiative will not immediately displace NVIDIA's dominance in the AI accelerator chip market, OpenAI's aggressive 2026 timeline is feasible due to strong financing advantages, including multiple funding rounds, pre-sale orders, strategic investments, and support from Microsoft. OpenAI has also recently secured a 6-gigawatt supply agreement with AMD and obtained an equity option, while NVIDIA plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. Google and Amazon are advancing their own AI chips, and Microsoft and Meta are pursuing similar efforts, though none have yet matched NVIDIA\u2019s performance.

This initiative underscores the growing energy demands driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence. The collaboration follows prior agreements with Nvidia and AMD, as OpenAI seeks to secure more computational resources to support its expanding user base. ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly users, and a company executive suggested on X that the newly launched video-generation app Sora is growing faster than ChatGPT. Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s co-founder and CEO, stated that the partnership is 'a fundamental step in building the infrastructure necessary to unlock AI\u2019s potential and deliver real benefits to people and businesses.' The deployment of the AI accelerators and networking systems is expected to begin in the second half of 2026. A 2024 U.S. Department of Energy report projects that data centers could consume between 6.7% and 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023. Altman previously noted that a single ChatGPT query uses as much energy as a lightbulb running for a few minutes, but generating realistic video clips with advanced models like Sora 2 likely consumes significantly more. Broadcom\u2019s stock rose 12% the morning after the announcement. The deal marks a strategic shift for OpenAI, enabling it to integrate AI model insights directly into hardware, as stated in the press release: 'enabling the integration of learnings from model and product development directly into hardware, opening new levels of capacity and intelligence.' The announcement followed Broadcom\u2019s CEO Hock Tan revealing during the company\u2019s earnings conference that they had secured a new $10 billion client, believed to be OpenAI.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 10:49 PM\nSource:[CNN](https://www.cnnchile.com/mundo/openai-nuevo-acuerdo-energia-chatgpt-y-sora-2_20251013/)\n\n**Measuring risk in the AI financing boom**\nThe artificial intelligence boom is entering a riskier phase, shifting from hyperscaler-driven capital expenditure funded by internal cash reserves to more leveraged, opaque, and circular financing structures.

The scalability of AI's financial returns is questionable: Bain estimates a $2 trillion annual revenue gap by 2030. The AI sector mirrors 1999\u2019s internet bubble in terms of inflated valuations, speculative spending, and reliance on unproven business models. Yet key differences exist: today\u2019s leading tech firms (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Amazon) are financially robust, with strong cash reserves and revenue. AI adoption is accelerating\u2014ChatGPT has 700 million weekly users\u2014and top AI firms report explosive growth. OpenAI\u2019s implied valuation reached $500 billion despite no profits. While some experts, including Bret Taylor and Jeff Bezos, believe the AI bubble will burst and many startups will fail, they also predict that, like the internet era, a few dominant firms will emerge to reshape the global economy. The article concludes that while the current AI frenzy resembles past speculative bubbles, its foundational technological impact may still be transformative.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 11:50 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8nGnbrDCDN8)\n\n**Billions Invested in AI: Questions Over Sustainability Amid Rapid Growth**\nGlobal tech giants are significantly increasing investments in artificial intelligence (AI), with Nvidia committing an additional $100 billion to OpenAI to build massive data centers. According to Gartner, global AI spending is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2025 and exceed $2 trillion by 2026\u2014about 2% of global GDP. Despite current revenues from OpenAI being only $13 billion, the company\u2019s valuation has reached $500 billion, making it the world\u2019s most valuable private startup, surpassing SpaceX. OpenAI leads the 'Starlink'-style 'Project Star' initiative, a $500 billion consortium involving SoftBank, Oracle, Microsoft, and Nvidia, aimed at constructing data centers in Texas with an area equivalent to Manhattan. Critics, including Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon, warn that such massive investments may fuel an economic bubble. While OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is used by 700 million people\u20149% of the world\u2019s population\u2014most users access it for free. Long-term sustainability depends on future monetization, with estimates suggesting global AI data center investments could exceed $500 billion annually by 2030, requiring $2 trillion in annual revenues. Despite a projected $800 billion shortfall, analysts like Dan Iverson of Wedbush remain optimistic, comparing the current AI boom to the 1996 internet surge rather than the 1999 dot-com bubble, arguing that while some will lose money, AI will endure like the internet did.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[SWI swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/ara/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AB%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A4%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1/90108752)\n\n**Tech Evening Brief: AI Updates and Global Innovations \u2013 October 1, 2025**\nOn October 1, 2025, major technology developments were reported globally. ASML, through its strategic advisor and former French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, announced a 1.3 billion euro investment in Mistral AI, aiming to strengthen Europe's tech ecosystem to counterbalance U.S. and Chinese technological dominance. Google clarified its 2026 developer identity verification rule for Android sideloading, stating it prioritizes security over eliminating sideloading, though critics argue it may entrench Google\u2019s control over app distribution. A Yale-Brookings study found that since ChatGPT\u2019s launch in late 2022, generative AI has not caused mass unemployment, with its labor market impact comparable to that of computers and the internet. Apple denied allegations of harming Elon Musk\u2019s xAI through its partnership with OpenAI, calling the antitrust claims speculative and asserting its right to collaborate with any AI provider. AI market cycles continue to alternate between 'bubble' fears and optimism, with Morgan Stanley warning of a $1.5 trillion funding gap in AI infrastructure by 2028, exacerbated by private credit market instability. High-value phone numbers, such as '9999999' and '66666666', sold for 1 million and 2 million RMB respectively in judicial auctions. China\u2019s Industrial and Commercial Bank completed a 3 billion RMB procurement of servers using domestic Hygon C86 chips, marking a major milestone in financial sector IT innovation. Demand for drone repair technicians is surging, with salaries reaching up to 1 million RMB annually due to a 53.7% year-on-year increase in civilian drone production. Nvidia\u2019s stock hit a record high, surpassing $4.5 trillion in market capitalization, driven by AI investments, including a potential $100 billion stake in OpenAI and a $14.2 billion service deal with Meta. OpenAI launched Sora 2, a new video generation model capable of producing synchronized audio, representing a significant leap in multimodal AI.

Meta delayed the release of its next-generation model, Llama 4 Behemoth, due to lack of significant performance gains, while OpenAI's GPT-5 also faced delays and underperformed expectations. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that market enthusiasm for AI may have surpassed the current technological capabilities. Despite this slowdown in cutting-edge model development, existing generative AI tools have already demonstrated strong business value in applications such as text summarization, code generation, and email drafting, while traditional AI tools continue to improve in areas like invoice processing and fleet management. According to MIT research, only 5% of customized AI projects succeed, primarily due to instability, excessive complexity, or poor alignment with business needs. Corporate leaders remain concerned about data leaks, inaccurate outputs, and risks in financial and customer decisions. However, the slowdown in AI progress may actually boost corporate investment confidence by making AI appear more predictable. McKinsey senior researcher Michael Chui emphasized that unlocking AI\u2019s full potential requires deep organizational transformation\u2014not just providing new tools. He compared AI\u2019s adoption trajectory to early internet development, noting that full benefits often take years to materialize, as seen with U.S. broadband penetration rising from near zero in 2000 to over 60% of adults by 2010. Recent trends suggest AI hype has cooled, leading to increased volatility in tech stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. Nevertheless, companies providing critical AI infrastructure\u2014such as Nvidia\u2014remain poised to benefit from sustained demand. Altman and other industry leaders are expected to continue massive investments in computing resources to scale AI applications, even without major breakthroughs, with Altman estimating that the chip industry may require trillions in investment. Ultimately, as AI becomes more stable and integrated, broader adoption will yield long-term benefits for enterprises, even if returns are gradual.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=d67f8b3d-de14-48b4-8b50-3981d7a46106)\n\n**Nvidia\u2019s Billion\u2011Dollar Bet on the Future of AI**\nNvidia has announced a historic financial bet on artificial intelligence by committing up to US$ 100\u202fbillion (\u2248R$\u202f533\u202fbillion) to OpenAI, according to a letter of intent signed on September\u202f23\u202f2025. The investment will fund the construction of data\u2011center facilities with a minimum capacity of 10\u202fgigawatts, a scale comparable to the energy use of small cities. The deal stipulates that for every gigawatt of capacity delivered, a new tranche of funding is released, beginning with an initial US$\u202f10\u202fbillion when the first gigawatt is connected to the grid, expected in the second half of 2026. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs will be used in massive quantities to train and run OpenAI\u2019s next\u2011generation AI models. The partnership is driven by the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which has surpassed 700\u202fmillion active users per week and is projected to reach one billion users by 2025. The project will also require additional investment in renewable energy, electrical grids, and advanced cooling systems, opening opportunities for infrastructure and energy providers. Data centers worldwide consume about 415\u202fTWh annually, per the International Energy Agency, roughly twice the annual energy consumption of Brazil; half of this is projected to be used by AI systems by the end of the year, according to Dutch researcher Alex de\u202fVries. The article emphasizes the need to discuss the environmental impact of this exponential growth in energy and water consumption.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 02:33 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/coluna/planeta-ia/a-aposta-bilionaria-da-nvidia-para-o-futuro-da-ia/)\n\n**Inside Nvidia's bold $170b bet to power the future of AI**\nNvidia and OpenAI have announced a partnership that will allow the San\u202fFrancisco\u2011based AI company to build and deploy data centres powered by Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which are expected to be operational in the second half of next year. The two firms will collaborate to optimise the integration of Nvidia\u2019s hardware and OpenAI\u2019s software, though no financial details have been disclosed beyond the overall scale of Nvidia\u2019s investment in OpenAI. Meanwhile, Nvidia has recently committed US$5\u202fbillion to help revive chip rival Intel, joining SoftBank and the U.S. government in a bid to support the once\u2011dominant maker. The partnership comes as tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI pour billions into AI after the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, originally designed for gaming, have become the backbone of generative\u2011AI workloads, prompting a scramble for the hardware. 'OpenAI released a keenly awaited new generation of its hallmark ChatGPT last month, touting significant advancements in artificial intelligence capabilities as a global race over the technology accelerates.' The latest ChatGPT\u20115 was released last month and is now free to the more than 700\u202fmillion weekly users of the tool, according to the company.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 06:53 PM\nSource:[NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nvidia-to-invest-up-to-1704b-in-openai-data-centres/TWUU3PFO6VAPRG6V66W6C7Z5GY/)\n\n**The Future of Global A.I.**\nThe BOND report, released in May\u202f2025, argues that the current wave of artificial\u2011intelligence (AI) development and adoption is unprecedented, driven by a recursive feedback loop of expanding capital expenditure (capex), a flourishing developer ecosystem, and a primed global user base.  According to the report, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT reached 1\u202fmillion users in five days, 800\u202fmillion weekly active users in 17\u202fmonths, and 90\u202f% of its users were from non\u2011U.S. geographies by its third year.  NVIDIA\u2019s AI ecosystem grew to six\u202fmillion developers over seven years, while Google Gemini\u2019s ecosystem saw a 500\u202f% jump to seven\u202fmillion developers in one year.  The number of AI\u2011related GitHub repositories rose 175\u202f% and the share of developers integrating AI into their workflows increased from 44\u202f% to 66\u202f% between 2023 and 2024.  The \u201cBig\u202fSix\u201d U.S. tech firms invested US$212\u202fbillion in capex in 2024, a 63\u202f% annual increase, raising the share of capex in revenue from 8\u202f% to 15\u202f%.  Training frontier models is projected to cost billions of dollars from 2025, whereas inference costs have fallen 99.7\u202f% between January\u202f2023 and January\u202f2025, with NVIDIA\u2019s 2024 Blackwell GPU using 105,000\u202ftimes less energy per token than its 2014 predecessor.  Data\u2011centre capex reached US$455\u202fbillion in 2024, and data centres accounted for 1.5\u202f% of global electricity consumption, up 12\u202f% per year since 2017.  The report notes that AI\u2011driven cognitive automation threatens white\u2011collar jobs, but also predicts new job categories in AI development, management, and ethics.  It acknowledges the risk of high valuations and low revenues for AI startups, citing OpenAI\u2019s US$3.7\u202fbillion revenue against a US$5\u202fbillion compute expense, and Anthropic\u2019s US$61.5\u202fbillion valuation despite a US$5.6\u202fbillion burn in 2024.  The report highlights China\u2019s rapid AI ascent, its open\u2011source models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Ernie), and its robotics integration, framing them as a challenge to U.S. dominance.  It calls for sovereign AI initiatives, noting partnerships such as NVIDIA\u2019s in France, Spain, and the UAE, and OpenAI\u2019s partnership with the UAE under its OpenAI for Countries programme.  The report concludes that the AI trajectory is a \u201ccompounder\u201d of growth, but warns that the lack of long\u2011term data on job displacement and the risk of a \u201cmutually assured deterrence\u201d scenario underscore the need for international norms and cooperative research.  The article quotes the BOND report as saying the document is \"filled with user, usage and revenue charts that go up-and-to-the-right\u2026often supported by spending charts that also go up-and-to-the-right.\"  It also cites Dario\u202fAmodei\u2019s claim that frontier model training will cost billions from 2025, and Jensen\u202fHuang\u2019s remark that workers are more likely to lose jobs to \"somebody who uses AI\" rather than AI itself.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 05:01 AM\nSource:[ORF](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-future-of-global-a-i)\n\n**Billions spent, little to show  --  MIT explains**\nThe article reports that the AI industry is experiencing a boom, with the six largest tech firms\u2014NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon and Meta\u2014each having a market valuation above $4 trillion and heavily investing in AI. NVIDIA supplies about 90% of the GPUs used in AI data centres. A new MIT NANDA study finds that only about 5% of AI pilot projects move beyond the incubation stage, largely because enterprises struggle to integrate AI tools and misallocate resources, with more than half of generative\u2011AI budgets spent on marketing rather than productivity. The report contrasts this low success rate with the 30% abandonment rate predicted by Gartner for generative\u2011AI projects by 2025. Successful pilots, according to MIT, start with a clear problem, set measurable KPIs tied to revenue or cost savings, build for adoption, and have champions across engineering and executive levels. Following the study\u2019s release, U.S. tech stocks lost roughly $1\u202ftrillion in four days, reflecting over\u2011valuation of AI firms that deliver little. The article cites OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who five days earlier said that AI is in a bubble, after the poorly received GPT\u20115 rollout forced OpenAI to revert to GPT\u20114o, which is no longer free. Altman\u2019s comments came after a 2024 report that OpenAI, Google and Anthropic had hit a development plateau, a view echoed by Bill Gates in 2023. The piece also references psychologist Gary Marcus, who has warned of an AI bubble since the GPT\u20112 era, noting that hype erodes public trust when releases fail to meet expectations. The article concludes that while AI can achieve great things, the current bubble threatens to pop, citing the market\u2019s recent sell\u2011off as evidence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 08:21 PM\nSource:[Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/the-ai-bubble-may-be-about-to-pop-heres-what-mits-95-percent-failure-stat-means)\n\n**AI Boom, Chip Turbulence, and Apple Crisis: Tech Giants Battle for the Future**\nThe article discusses the ongoing AI boom, noting that hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta have increased their investment budgets to a historic 400\u2013450\u202fbillion\u202fUS\u202fdollars per year. It highlights NVIDIA as the central player in the AI revolution, the sole GPU leader for training large language models, but cautions that the company\u2019s heavy reliance on a handful of customers and lack of recurring revenue justify a 5\u202f% fund allocation\u2014an underweight of 9\u202f%. The piece cites that hyperscalers will invest roughly 400\u202fbillion\u202fUS\u202fdollars in 2024, while OpenAI\u2019s revenue is only 13\u202fbillion\u202fUS\u202fdollars against a total generative\u2011AI market of about 20\u202fbillion\u202fUS\u202fdollars, underscoring the unsustainability of the current investment\u2011to\u2011revenue ratio. A 17\u202f% one\u2011day drop in NVIDIA\u2019s share price after Deepseek demonstrated that cheaper chips can run AI models was used as evidence of risk. The article also notes that software firms like Adobe and Intuit saw short\u2011term price spikes, yet Adobe\u2019s projected 2024 AI revenue is only 250\u202fmillion\u202fUS\u202fdollars on a 20\u202fbillion\u202fUS\u202fdollar top line. It contrasts this with strong consumer subscription growth for OpenAI\u2019s 20\u202fUS\u202fdollar and 200\u202fUS\u202fdollar plans. The commentary stresses that the real lever remains enterprise monetisation, so the fund focuses on hyperscalers as the stable base, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle as core holdings. Google faces double pressure from ChatGPT and Gemini, losing market share in search while risking cannibalisation of its own business. Gemini\u2019s user base is estimated at 400\u2013500\u202fmillion, but Deepseek\u2019s success on cheaper hardware signals fragility even for dominant players. Apple is portrayed as lagging, having lost 20\u202f% of its value in 2024 and its P/E falling from 30 to 25; the fund holds only 1.5\u202f% of Apple shares, an underweight of 10\u202f%. The article concludes that investors should exercise patience, diversify within tech, and focus on companies benefiting from AI infrastructure rather than headline\u2011grabbing names. The tone is analytical, with data\u2011driven arguments and a cautious stance on specific holdings.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 12:22 PM\nSource:[it-daily.net](https://www.it-daily.net/shortnews/tech-giganten-kaempfen-um-zukunft)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014including public policy analysis, technology policy, political science, law, and science and technology studies\u2014consensus is overwhelming that the probability of the US passing a comprehensive federal bill primarily focused on general AI regulation before January 1, 2026, is very low. Experts universally cite the extreme institutional inertia and procedural bottlenecks of the US legislative system, especially during a post-election lame-duck session with less than three months until the deadline. Historical base rates for passing major, cross-sector technology regulation in such a time frame are near zero, with previous efforts (such as privacy, antitrust, or tech platform regulation) taking years and often stalling due to partisanship, lack of consensus, and powerful industry lobbying. The growing public concern about AI risks (e.g., disinformation, fraud, economic bubbles) and international pressure (notably from the EU's AI Act) are acknowledged as slight upward influences, but are not seen as sufficient without a catalyzing crisis. Most experts argue that only a major, unpredictable AI-driven incident in the very near future could open a policy window large enough for swift bipartisan action\u2014and no such incident is evident in recent news. The most likely scenario is that AI regulation in the US remains a patchwork of executive orders, agency guidance, and state laws until after the 2026 election, with federal legislation deferred. Final probabilities assigned by experts cluster between 2% and 18%, with a central tendency in the single digits. The group chat and analysis show strong convergence: absent a dramatic and imminent crisis, the passage of such an AI bill by the target date is extremely improbable.",
