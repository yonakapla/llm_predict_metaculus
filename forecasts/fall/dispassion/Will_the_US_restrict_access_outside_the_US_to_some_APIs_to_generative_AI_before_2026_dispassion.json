The original question opened on 2023-05-17 15:19:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17100). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAs of May 2023, US law does not restrict API or browser access to any Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 (ChatGPT) or Google Bard. As the capabilities of such systems grow, and users learn more how to extract certain types of knowledge (e.g. how to enrich uranium or create Deep Fakes), one way US policymakers might address risks would be to restrict usage to those that are verified to be in the US.\n\nA similar regime exists for Digital Rights Management for music & movies - access to music on Spotify or shows on Netflix or Prime Video may depend on your country of origin. (And people regularly use VPNs to pretend to be from some other place to access this content.) Copyrights and trade agreements more generally often have provisions for various countries, and some countries like China ban access to entire systems via firewalls.\n\nThis question asks about APIs, not browser or app usage, because APIs are the most flexible way to use large AI systems. (In April 2023, [Italy banned and then unbanned](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/28/23702883/chatgpt-italy-ban-lifted-gpdp-data-protection-age-verification) ChatGPT's interface but not the API, which was decried as ineffectual.)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17100,\"question_id\":17100}}`",

The measure, driven by urgent concerns over minors' access to online pornography, is part of a broader European effort to protect youth. According to Agcom, only 1.2 million of Italy\u2019s 6 million minors aged 8\u201316 with smartphones have parental controls enabled, and 88% of Italian adolescents reportedly view online pornographic content regularly. The Italian system will use a 'double anonymity' model: users obtain a digital code from an independent third party\u2014such as a bank or telecom provider\u2014that verifies their majority without revealing identity to the website. This design aims to preserve user privacy while ensuring age compliance. France, which implemented similar rules in June 2024, saw Pornhub and YouPorn block access across the country in protest. Aylo, the parent company, chose to exit France, citing privacy rights, mirroring its 2023 departure from Louisiana. However, as noted by Italian media, such restrictions may push users\u2014including minors\u2014toward the dark web and illegal sites that lack content moderation and often host extreme material, creating greater risks. In contrast, the UK uses the Online Safety Act, requiring age verification via email, bank card, or facial recognition, allowing Pornhub to remain accessible under oversight. In the US, 24 states have enacted similar laws, and the Supreme Court upheld age verification in June 2024, ruling it protects minors without violating free speech. In France, users have rapidly circumvented blocks using VPNs: Proton saw a 1,000% surge in sign-ups within 30 minutes of Pornhub\u2019s blocking, and Free\u2019s new free mVPN service has further amplified this trend, enabling users to bypass restrictions via foreign servers and remain virtually invisible to France\u2019s Arcom.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 06:35 AM\nSource:[01net](https://www.01net.com/actualites/verification-dage-obligatoire-litalie-suit-lexemple-de-la-france-contre-pornhub.html)\n\n**8 Questions That Are Banned from Being Asked to ChatGPT \u2013 THE LIST**\nChatGPT, a widely used AI system, enforces strict safety and ethical guidelines that prevent it from responding to certain types of requests. According to a report by moderator.az published on October 18, 2025, there are eight categories of queries that the system automatically blocks or refuses. These include: (1) requests for personal data such as ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses, or private details about public figures; (2) commands related to violence, crime, or harmful activities, including instructions for making weapons, drugs, or harmful substances, or self-harm and harming others; (3) hate speech or discriminatory content based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or ideology; (4) medical or psychological diagnoses, such as asking for a diagnosis or advice on medication use; (5) legal or financial guidance, including advice on divorce strategies, investment returns, or tax evasion; (6) manipulation and disinformation, such as generating fake news, conspiracy theories, or misleading content; (7) explicit or sexual content, including pornographic material, though romantic or emotional themes are allowed within boundaries; and (8) attempts to manipulate the AI\u2019s identity, such as instructing it to pretend to be someone else or bypass restrictions. The system blocks these queries to protect users and uphold ethical and legal standards.\nOriginal language: az\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 02:42 AM\nSource:[moderator.az](https://moderator.az/az/foto/918388/chatgpt-ye-verilmesi-qadaan-edilen-8-sual-siyahi/)\n\n**OpenAI Opens Door to Adult Content in ChatGPT Starting December 2025**\nOpenAI announced plans to increase usage freedom for adult users of ChatGPT starting December 2025, as part of a new policy titled 'treating adult users as adults,' according to CEO Sam Altman in a recent social media post. This shift follows OpenAI's September 2024 announcement of new parental controls and automated age-detection features. Under the new policy, certain content types\u2014including adult material\u2014will be accessible to users who have verified their age. Altman stated the goal is to 'achieve a balance between freedom and responsibility,' noting that restricting minors from sensitive content will create a safer environment for younger users while granting adults greater interaction freedom without strict limitations. The change reflects OpenAI's broader move to diversify ChatGPT's use cases beyond educational and professional conversations. Previously strict against adult content, OpenAI is now adopting a more pragmatic approach aligned with global user demands. Early signs emerged at DevDay 2025, where OpenAI introduced new developer guidelines allowing adult-focused applications, provided they implement age verification and robust safety measures. Official access to 'adult experiences' in ChatGPT will begin in December. The move has sparked debate: some view it as a realistic response to user needs, while others warn of ethical and social risks, especially in light of the 2025 suicide of 16-year-old Adam Rayn, which prompted OpenAI to introduce periodic reminder notifications and modify ChatGPT\u2019s emotional engagement behavior. Observers suggest OpenAI aims to build 'mutual trust' rather than excessive control, while others believe the company is also seeking to compete in the rapidly growing market for adult-oriented generative AI content. OpenAI is preparing a comprehensive verification system based on age verification and formal identity confirmation to ensure sensitive content does not reach underage users. The policy remains a subject of intense discussion in technical and academic circles, with some seeing it as a natural evolution of user freedom and others as an ethically risky descent. As AI enters a new phase of societal awareness, the boundaries of what is 'allowed' and 'prohibited' appear more flexible than ever.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 10:35 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0641\u062f](https://www.alwafd.news/5709885)\n\n**Mint Explainer | When AI turns adult: the ethics of erotica in chatbots**\nOpenAI plans to allow age-verified adult users access to erotic content in a new version of ChatGPT launching in December 2025, marking a shift from earlier restrictions tied to mental health concerns. CEO Sam Altman argues that improved safeguards now justify treating adults 'like adults,' with the update including stricter age verification, expanded personality features, and a 'treat adults like adults' approach. OpenAI has established an eight-member 'expert council on well-being and AI' comprising psychologists, psychiatrists, and human-computer interaction researchers to guide safety protocols. The company is also collaborating with the Global Physician Network to align AI responses with psychiatric and crisis-intervention best practices. Despite these measures, concerns persist: a Stanford report warns that AI can mimic emotional intimacy\u2014using phrases like 'I dream about you'\u2014which may blur fantasy and reality, especially for teens whose prefrontal cortex is still developing. A Syracuse University study found significant variation in how major AI models handle sexual prompts: Claude enforces strict bans, GPT-4o uses nuanced redirection, Gemini allows limited flexibility, and Deepseek shows inconsistent moderation, exposing an 'ethical implementation gap.' Critics argue that allowing adults access to erotic content risks normalizing exploitative behavior, especially given the prevalence of submissive, female-coded AI personas that reflect the male gaze in training data. Platforms like Replika, CarynAI, and DreamGF already charge for romantic or erotic interactions, raising concerns about monetizing intimacy. Ethicists warn that coded 'consent' in AI may not be real, and that responsibility for misuse\u2014whether by users, platforms, or developers\u2014remains legally ambiguous. Regulatory approaches vary: China bans AI-generated erotica, the EU\u2019s AI Act may classify it as 'high-risk' requiring human oversight, while the US and India are still developing frameworks. Overregulation could push users to unregulated markets, as seen when Replika banned NSFW content and users migrated to open-source alternatives. OpenAI maintains that parental controls remain the most effective tool for family management, and that responses should differ for users under 18. The debate centers not on whether adults can handle such content, but whether platforms adequately prepare them for psychological consequences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 09:14 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/technology/chatgpt-adult-content-openai-erotic-content-ai-chatbots-sam-altman-11760599971493.html)\n\n**OpenAI to permit adult content on chatGPT for verified users - Daily Times**\nOpenAI has announced a significant policy shift allowing verified adult users to access erotic content on ChatGPT, marking a major departure from previous restrictions. The change is part of OpenAI\u2019s new 'treat adult users like adults' principle, aimed at creating a more open and customizable experience for mature users. CEO Sam Altman stated that earlier safety controls, introduced to address mental health concerns, had made ChatGPT 'less useful or enjoyable' for users not facing such risks. The updated safety tools now enable a balance between user freedom and protection against harmful content. This move follows a high-profile controversy involving the death of a California teenager, which led to a lawsuit alleging that ChatGPT provided harmful advice and prompted a US Federal Trade Commission inquiry into AI\u2019s impact on minors. The new features include customizable AI personalities, emoji-based expressions, and friend-like conversational tones. The allowance of erotic content is scheduled to roll out in December 2025, contingent on the completion of a new age-verification system. Users under 18 will continue to be directed to a restricted ChatGPT experience that blocks adult and graphic content. OpenAI is also developing behavior-based age estimation technology using chat interaction patterns to enhance safety compliance and responsible AI use.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 05:44 PM\nSource:[dailytimes.com.pk](https://dailytimes.com.pk/1384295/openai-to-permit-adult-content-on-chatgpt-for-verified-users/)\n\n**OpenAI to Allow Explicit Content in ChatGPT for Adults Amid Growing Regulatory Scrutiny**\nOn October 18, 2025, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced that ChatGPT will ease restrictions on content, allowing adults to use the platform for personal, intimate, and sexually explicit conversations. This shift follows the development of mental health tools by OpenAI, which the company claims now ensure user safety. The move aligns with a broader industry trend toward 'intimacy-driven' AI, exemplified by xAI's Grok and its 'Companions'\u2014animated characters like Ani (a Japanese manga-inspired girl) and Valentine (a British-accented boy)\u2014designed for flirtation. These services, including Replika, are marketed as solutions to loneliness, especially among young men, and as ethical alternatives to traditional pornography. However, concerns persist: many AI companions are predominantly female, sexually stylized, and reinforce problematic gender stereotypes, with personality traits like 'submissive and obedient' or 'innocent and naive.' Studies have shown that AI chatbots often fail to respect user-set boundaries, sometimes making inappropriate or harassing remarks. Research published in *Computers in Human Behavior Reports* indicates that prolonged use can lead to psychological dependency, with users forming stronger emotional bonds with AI than with real people. Regulatory scrutiny is increasing: Italy's Garante per la Privacy blocked Replika in 2023 over inadequate age verification, and in the U.S., 44 attorneys general jointly urged tech companies to safeguard minors. California has enacted a new law requiring age verification and protocols to detect suicidal ideation or self-harm, prompted by the suicide of a 16-year-old who confided in ChatGPT. While companies argue that many users seek companionship, not sex, the ethical and safety risks remain significant.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[Il Post](https://www.ilpost.it/2025/10/18/intelligenze-artificiali-erotismo/)\n\n**The platform exposing exactly how much copyrighted art is used by AI tools**\nThe UK-based tech platform Vermillio claims it can trace the percentage of AI-generated images derived from pre-existing copyrighted material using a 'neural fingerprint' technique. In tests for The Guardian, Vermillio found that Google's Veo3 video generator produced a Doctor Who-themed video with an 80% match to the copyrighted Doctor Who fingerprint, while OpenAI's Sora tool generated a video with an 87% match. Other tests showed strong matches for James Bond (62% for Sora, 28% for ChatGPT, 86% for Gemini), Jurassic Park, and Frozen. These findings highlight concerns that AI models like OpenAI's Sora and Google's Veo3 rely heavily on copyrighted content without permission. Creative professionals and publishers, including the Financial Times and Guardian Media Group, are demanding compensation and licensing agreements. OpenAI asserts its training data comes from publicly available sources under the US legal doctrine of fair use, while Google states its generative AI policies prohibit IP violations but allows YouTube content to be used for AI training. The Motion Picture Association has urged OpenAI to block copyrighted characters in Sora upon request. In the UK, artists are opposing proposed copyright law changes that would allow AI companies to use copyrighted works without permission unless creators opt out.

The measure, driven by urgent concerns over minors' access to online pornography, is part of a broader European effort to protect youth. According to Agcom, only 1.2 million of Italy\u2019s 6 million minors aged 8\u201316 with smartphones have parental controls enabled, and 88% of Italian adolescents reportedly view online pornographic content regularly. The Italian system will use a 'double anonymity' model: users obtain a digital code from an independent third party\u2014such as a bank or telecom provider\u2014that verifies their majority without revealing identity to the website. This design aims to preserve user privacy while ensuring age compliance. France, which implemented similar rules in June 2024, saw Pornhub and YouPorn block access across the country in protest. Aylo, the parent company, chose to exit France, citing privacy rights, mirroring its 2023 departure from Louisiana. However, as noted by Italian media, such restrictions may push users\u2014including minors\u2014toward the dark web and illegal sites that lack content moderation and often host extreme material, creating greater risks. In contrast, the UK uses the Online Safety Act, requiring age verification via email, bank card, or facial recognition, allowing Pornhub to remain accessible under oversight. In the US, 24 states have enacted similar laws, and the Supreme Court upheld age verification in June 2024, ruling it protects minors without violating free speech. In France, users have rapidly circumvented blocks using VPNs: Proton saw a 1,000% surge in sign-ups within 30 minutes of Pornhub\u2019s blocking, and Free\u2019s new free mVPN service has further amplified this trend, enabling users to bypass restrictions via foreign servers and remain virtually invisible to France\u2019s Arcom.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 06:35 AM\nSource:[01net](https://www.01net.com/actualites/verification-dage-obligatoire-litalie-suit-lexemple-de-la-france-contre-pornhub.html)\n\n**OpenAI to Relax 18+ Restrictions on ChatGPT: New Policy Allows Adult Content Creation Amid Ethical and Regulatory Concerns**\nOpenAI announced on October 18, 2025, that starting in December, verified adult users will be allowed to access and generate explicit content in ChatGPT, marking a major policy shift. CEO Sam Altman stated the change is based on treating adults as responsible individuals, emphasizing the need to balance user freedom with mental health and abuse prevention. The update will be rolled out gradually, accompanied by enhanced safety tools, age verification, and content classification systems. Previously, OpenAI strictly restricted sensitive topics including violence and pornography, but critics argued this made the AI feel 'too safe and uninteresting,' reducing its human-like interaction. The new policy includes customizable AI personalities, allowing users to choose more conversational, emotionally responsive, or emoji-enabled styles to make interactions feel more natural. This move is seen as a strategic response to competition from xAI\u2019s Grok, which launched a 'spicy mode' enabling adult content creation and attracting significant user attention. Industry analysts view the shift as an attempt to capture the growing adult entertainment and emotional companionship AI market, though experts warn it opens ethical and regulatory risks. The EU\u2019s AI Act and multiple U.S. states are advancing legislation on AI-generated pornography and deepfakes, raising concerns about accountability and transparency. OpenAI\u2019s prior investigation over a 2024 California teen suicide case\u2014where the teen reportedly received specific suicide methods from ChatGPT\u2014has intensified scrutiny. The company now claims its upgraded platform will use stricter age verification and behavioral detection to prevent underage access. Despite this, experts caution that unrestricted adult content generation could lead to deepfakes, sexual exploitation, privacy violations, and infringement of celebrity image rights, urging platforms to implement clear labeling and traceability mechanisms to maintain public trust.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11074854)\n\n**8 Questions That Are Banned from Being Asked to ChatGPT \u2013 THE LIST**\nChatGPT, a widely used AI system, enforces strict safety and ethical guidelines that prevent it from responding to certain types of requests. According to a report by moderator.az published on October 18, 2025, there are eight categories of queries that the system automatically blocks or refuses. These include: (1) requests for personal data such as ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses, or private details about public figures; (2) commands related to violence, crime, or harmful activities, including instructions for making weapons, drugs, or harmful substances, or self-harm and harming others; (3) hate speech or discriminatory content based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or ideology; (4) medical or psychological diagnoses, such as asking for a diagnosis or advice on medication use; (5) legal or financial guidance, including advice on divorce strategies, investment returns, or tax evasion; (6) manipulation and disinformation, such as generating fake news, conspiracy theories, or misleading content; (7) explicit or sexual content, including pornographic material, though romantic or emotional themes are allowed within boundaries; and (8) attempts to manipulate the AI\u2019s identity, such as instructing it to pretend to be someone else or bypass restrictions. The system blocks these queries to protect users and uphold ethical and legal standards.\nOriginal language: az\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 02:42 AM\nSource:[moderator.az](https://moderator.az/az/foto/918388/chatgpt-ye-verilmesi-qadaan-edilen-8-sual-siyahi/)\n\n**OpenAI Opens Door to Adult Content in ChatGPT Starting December 2025**\nOpenAI announced plans to increase usage freedom for adult users of ChatGPT starting December 2025, as part of a new policy titled 'treating adult users as adults,' according to CEO Sam Altman in a recent social media post. This shift follows OpenAI's September 2024 announcement of new parental controls and automated age-detection features. Under the new policy, certain content types\u2014including adult material\u2014will be accessible to users who have verified their age. Altman stated the goal is to 'achieve a balance between freedom and responsibility,' noting that restricting minors from sensitive content will create a safer environment for younger users while granting adults greater interaction freedom without strict limitations. The change reflects OpenAI's broader move to diversify ChatGPT's use cases beyond educational and professional conversations. Previously strict against adult content, OpenAI is now adopting a more pragmatic approach aligned with global user demands. Early signs emerged at DevDay 2025, where OpenAI introduced new developer guidelines allowing adult-focused applications, provided they implement age verification and robust safety measures. Official access to 'adult experiences' in ChatGPT will begin in December. The move has sparked debate: some view it as a realistic response to user needs, while others warn of ethical and social risks, especially in light of the 2025 suicide of 16-year-old Adam Rayn, which prompted OpenAI to introduce periodic reminder notifications and modify ChatGPT\u2019s emotional engagement behavior. Observers suggest OpenAI aims to build 'mutual trust' rather than excessive control, while others believe the company is also seeking to compete in the rapidly growing market for adult-oriented generative AI content. OpenAI is preparing a comprehensive verification system based on age verification and formal identity confirmation to ensure sensitive content does not reach underage users. The policy remains a subject of intense discussion in technical and academic circles, with some seeing it as a natural evolution of user freedom and others as an ethically risky descent. As AI enters a new phase of societal awareness, the boundaries of what is 'allowed' and 'prohibited' appear more flexible than ever.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 10:35 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0641\u062f](https://www.alwafd.news/5709885)\n\n**OpenAI Plans to Allow Erotic Content in ChatGPT for Verified Adults Starting December 2025**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced that ChatGPT will permit moderated erotic content for verified adult users starting December 2025. The change, revealed during a public presentation, will allow narrative or creative content with a sexual tone, provided it adheres to strict safety frameworks and access is restricted to users over 18. Explicit pornography will remain prohibited. Altman stated the shift reflects OpenAI's goal to 'treat adult users as adults,' arguing previous policies were overly restrictive during the model's early development phase. The announcement triggered widespread reactions: tech figures warned of potential accidental access by minors despite verification systems, and digital protection organizations called for greater transparency on safety controls. Altman responded that the rollout will rely on enhanced security, supervision, and specialized moderation tools designed to prevent abuse. This decision positions OpenAI as a pioneer among major AI platforms in introducing regulated adult content, potentially pressuring other companies to reconsider their rigid policies on sexuality.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 02:53 AM\nSource:[TC Televisi\u00f3n](https://tctelevision.com/lo-ultimo/ciencia-tecnologia/openai-planea-habilitar-contenido-erotico-en-chatgpt/)\n\n**China's government was detected using ChatGPT to promote communist rule, suppress dissent**\nAccording to a 37-page OpenAI intelligence report titled 'Disrupting malicious uses of AI: October 2025,' published on October 7, 2025, Chinese government-linked entities have been using ChatGPT to promote communist ideology, suppress dissent, and conduct surveillance. The report states that over 40 networks on ChatGPT were disrupted since February 2024 for violating usage policies, including Chinese government actors, Russian hackers developing malware, and North Korean hackers engaged in anti-South Korean activities. OpenAI reported that Chinese government-linked accounts were banned for attempting to use ChatGPT to design AI-powered social media spying tools capable of scanning platforms like Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, and YouTube for 'extremist speech, and ethnic, religious, and political content.' One banned user sought to create a 'High-Risk Uyghur-Related Inflow Warning Model,' referencing the State Department\u2019s 2021 declaration of genocide against Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which China denies. Another case involved a request to analyze transport bookings against police records to track Uyghurs. OpenAI also blocked users for using the chatbot to profile critics of the Chinese government, identify funding sources for dissident X accounts, and locate organizers of a petition in Mongolia. Additionally, users accessed ChatGPT via VPNs to request summaries of censored topics in China, including the June 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and the Dalai Lama\u2019s birthday. OpenAI emphasized its commitment to 'democratic AI' that prevents authoritarian regimes from using AI to control populations, stating that such misuse includes surveillance, coercion, scams, and covert influence operations. The report noted that while AI is being used to accelerate old tactics, it does not grant novel offensive capabilities. Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and xAI\u2019s Grok did not respond to inquiries about similar Chinese threat activity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 01:17 PM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/16/chinas-government-detected-using-chatgpt-promote-communist-rule/)\n\n**Mint Explainer | When AI turns adult: the ethics of erotica in chatbots**\nOpenAI plans to allow age-verified adult users access to erotic content in a new version of ChatGPT launching in December 2025, marking a shift from earlier restrictions tied to mental health concerns. CEO Sam Altman argues that improved safeguards now justify treating adults 'like adults,' with the update including stricter age verification, expanded personality features, and a 'treat adults like adults' approach. OpenAI has established an eight-member 'expert council on well-being and AI' comprising psychologists, psychiatrists, and human-computer interaction researchers to guide safety protocols. The company is also collaborating with the Global Physician Network to align AI responses with psychiatric and crisis-intervention best practices. Despite these measures, concerns persist: a Stanford report warns that AI can mimic emotional intimacy\u2014using phrases like 'I dream about you'\u2014which may blur fantasy and reality, especially for teens whose prefrontal cortex is still developing. A Syracuse University study found significant variation in how major AI models handle sexual prompts: Claude enforces strict bans, GPT-4o uses nuanced redirection, Gemini allows limited flexibility, and Deepseek shows inconsistent moderation, exposing an 'ethical implementation gap.' Critics argue that allowing adults access to erotic content risks normalizing exploitative behavior, especially given the prevalence of submissive, female-coded AI personas that reflect the male gaze in training data. Platforms like Replika, CarynAI, and DreamGF already charge for romantic or erotic interactions, raising concerns about monetizing intimacy. Ethicists warn that coded 'consent' in AI may not be real, and that responsibility for misuse\u2014whether by users, platforms, or developers\u2014remains legally ambiguous. Regulatory approaches vary: China bans AI-generated erotica, the EU\u2019s AI Act may classify it as 'high-risk' requiring human oversight, while the US and India are still developing frameworks. Overregulation could push users to unregulated markets, as seen when Replika banned NSFW content and users migrated to open-source alternatives. OpenAI maintains that parental controls remain the most effective tool for family management, and that responses should differ for users under 18. The debate centers not on whether adults can handle such content, but whether platforms adequately prepare them for psychological consequences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 09:14 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/technology/chatgpt-adult-content-openai-erotic-content-ai-chatbots-sam-altman-11760599971493.html)\n\n**ChatGPT to Launch Adult Mode: OpenAI's Plan for Verified Adult Users**\nOpenAI plans to introduce an adult content mode for ChatGPT in December 2025, featuring age verification to restrict access to verified adults only. The company is developing automated age estimation systems based on content and phrasing, with potential document verification if misclassification occurs. The exact scope remains unclear\u2014whether the feature will include only text, or also generate images and videos. OpenAI has not addressed how it will prevent non-consensual content or deepfakes. This move comes amid heightened scrutiny: in summer 2025, multiple cases emerged where ChatGPT allegedly provided dangerous advice to mentally vulnerable users, including a lawsuit by a California family over suicide planning. In response, OpenAI introduced GPT-5 with reduced flattery, child safety features, and parental controls in August 2025. Now, CEO Sam Altman claims the 'serious mental health issues' have been addressed, just as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched investigations into tech firms' risks to minors. OpenAI also formed an eight-member expert advisory board on well-being and AI, raising questions about whether this is a public relations strategy. OpenAI is not the first to enter this space: Elon Musk\u2019s xAI and Character.AI already offer sexually explicit AI companions, with Character.AI reporting users spending an average of two hours daily on the platform in 2023\u2014though it faces lawsuits over user safety. Historically, adult content has driven innovation in media, and the market for AI-generated erotic content is growing rapidly. OpenAI\u2019s shift reflects pressure to grow user numbers and revenue amid fierce competition from Google and Meta, despite uncertainty about its profitability. Altman claims the feature is optional and designed to give users 'real choice,' but critics note that opt-in systems have proven unreliable. Questions remain about data usage: could erotic chat logs be used to train future AI models? The announcement marks a turning point in AI, signaling that adult content is moving from taboo to normalization. Users are now faced with greater freedom\u2014but also greater responsibility. Parents and guardians are urged to monitor which AI tools children use, even if companies claim safety measures are in place.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[Westdeutscher Rundfunk](https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/openai-chatgpt-chatbot-geplanter-erotik-modus-fuer-erwachsene-100.html)\n\n**OpenAI to permit adult content on chatGPT for verified users - Daily Times**\nOpenAI has announced a significant policy shift allowing verified adult users to access erotic content on ChatGPT, marking a major departure from previous restrictions. The change is part of OpenAI\u2019s new 'treat adult users like adults' principle, aimed at creating a more open and customizable experience for mature users. CEO Sam Altman stated that earlier safety controls, introduced to address mental health concerns, had made ChatGPT 'less useful or enjoyable' for users not facing such risks. The updated safety tools now enable a balance between user freedom and protection against harmful content. This move follows a high-profile controversy involving the death of a California teenager, which led to a lawsuit alleging that ChatGPT provided harmful advice and prompted a US Federal Trade Commission inquiry into AI\u2019s impact on minors. The new features include customizable AI personalities, emoji-based expressions, and friend-like conversational tones. The allowance of erotic content is scheduled to roll out in December 2025, contingent on the completion of a new age-verification system. Users under 18 will continue to be directed to a restricted ChatGPT experience that blocks adult and graphic content.

This change will be implemented in December 2025, following the full rollout of age verification. Altman explained that while initial restrictions were introduced to protect mental health\u2014particularly for vulnerable users\u2014these safeguards can now be relaxed for the vast majority of users, as '0.1% of a billion users is still a million people' who may be at risk. The upcoming version of ChatGPT's model, GPT-5o, will feature a more human-like personality, with enhanced expressiveness, including the use of emojis and conversational tones, but only when explicitly desired by the user. OpenAI emphasized that adult content will only be accessible upon request and not through default settings. The company continues to prohibit harmful uses such as sexual deepfakes and revenge porn, and maintains strict protections for under-18s, including parental controls and 'age-prediction' software that defaults to a child-safe version if user age cannot be confirmed. This shift follows a 2023 report stating that 98% of deepfake videos online were pornographic, and concerns raised by women's rights advocates. The update comes amid growing scrutiny of AI's role in relationships, with one in five U.S. students knowing someone who has had a romantic relationship with an AI. A prior bug in April 2025 allowed minors to generate erotica, which has since been patched. The legal and ethical implications were highlighted by the ongoing lawsuit filed by the family of teenager Adam Raine, who died after forming a close bond with ChatGPT. OpenAI reiterated that the mental health safeguards remain in place for minors, and no changes to content policies will apply to users under 18.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 10:36 AM\nSource:[Metro](https://metro.co.uk/2025/10/15/chatgpt-update-allow-users-make-erotica-will-treat-adults-like-adults-24430694/)\n\n**SB 243: California Enacts New AI Law to Protect Youth from Harmful Chatbot Interactions**\nCalifornia has passed SB 243, a new law regulating AI chatbots to protect youth and vulnerable adults. The law mandates that AI chatbots must be clearly identifiable as such and prohibits them from impersonating medical professionals, therapists, or other experts\u2014practices previously reported to have occurred. The law specifically targets minors, who are more susceptible to harmful advice due to lack of experience, though protections extend to vulnerable adults as well. Key provisions include mandatory age verification systems, with OpenAI planning to implement one for ChatGPT starting December 2025, which will also unlock adult-only features like erotic conversations. Chatbots must log conversations that veer into dangerous territory, provide resources for help, prompt users to take breaks, block inappropriate content for minors, and warn users about risks before use. The law also strengthens penalties for AI-generated deepfake pornography and holds AI providers liable for damages. The law applies broadly to major providers like Meta, OpenAI, xAI, Google, and specialized platforms such as Character.ai and Replika, which allow users to create personalized AI companions\u2014criticized for potential harm to children. The law was prompted by incidents including a 16-year-old\u2019s suicide allegedly supported by ChatGPT and a 13-year-old girl\u2019s case involving Character.ai, along with leaked documents showing Meta\u2019s chatbots engaging in romantic conversations with minors. SB 243 follows California\u2019s earlier AI law, SB 53, which focused on transparency. While other U.S. states are considering similar legislation, former President Donald Trump previously opposed AI regulation, citing concerns about U.S. competitiveness with China in the AI race.

CEO Sam Altman stated on October 14 (local time) that a new version of ChatGPT, reflecting features of GPT-4o, will be launched in a few weeks, with full age restriction functionality implemented by December. Adults who verify their age will be permitted to access explicit content, including erotica. Altman explained that while ChatGPT was initially designed with limited features to address mental health concerns, this approach unintentionally reduced usability and enjoyment for users without mental health issues. Now, with new tools available to mitigate serious mental health risks, OpenAI plans to lift restrictions in most cases. This shift comes amid growing global concerns over AI and social media ethics, following high-profile incidents: a 14-year-old in Florida died after a conversation with an AI chatbot expressing love and a request to come to him; a 16-year-old in California died after discussing self-harm; and a 13-year-old girl in Colorado died after a chatbot interaction in 2023. In response, California passed legislation effective January 1, 2026, requiring AI companies to verify user age, disclose that interactions are with AI, and detect and respond to self-harm expressions. Australia has also enacted the world\u2019s first law banning social media use for minors under 16, set to take effect in December 2025. The European Union is reviewing similar legislation. OpenAI\u2019s strategy\u2014removing restrictions for verified adults\u2014aligns with similar moves by xAI, Elon Musk\u2019s company, which launched an '19+ chatbot' for paid, adult-verified subscribers. However, concerns remain. Axios questioned whether AI companies aim to replicate the historical trajectory of pornography, which has driven technological advancements from videotapes to digital video and interactive games. BBC noted that while OpenAI may attract more paid subscribers, the move could increase pressure to strengthen chatbot regulation.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 05:52 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/america/1223493.html)\n\n**Meta Strengthens Safety Controls for Teen Accounts on Instagram**\nMeta, the parent company of Instagram, announced new restrictions for teen accounts on Instagram, effective immediately in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, with global expansion planned in the coming months. The updated safety framework, which applies automatically to users aged 13 to 18, introduces stricter content filtering based on a 'PG-13'-style classification system used in American cinema, designed to block content deemed sensitive or potentially harmful. This includes material with harsh language, risky challenges, or content that may promote harmful behavior. The decision is made by a committee (CARA) composed of independent parents, and Meta uses a combination of AI and human review to assess content. Teen accounts will be automatically placed in a '13+' mode, and users cannot exit this setting without parental consent. Age verification requires either a government ID or a self-recorded video selfie if there is uncertainty. Meta also introduced a 'Limited Content' option allowing parents to restrict teens from viewing or commenting on posts and, starting next year, to limit AI-powered conversations. These changes follow growing criticism over the negative mental health impacts of social media and generative AI chatbots, including recent teen suicide cases. In September 2025, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok after a complaint against OpenAI.

Input privacy risks include the inadvertent exposure of personal or confidential data\u2014such as when Samsung employees leaked proprietary code via ChatGPT, a situation where data cannot be retrieved or deleted from external servers. OpenAI retains user conversations by default to train models, increasing exposure risks. Output privacy risks involve LLMs memorizing and regurgitating sensitive training data, including personal information like addresses and phone numbers, or leaking data from other users due to bugs\u2014such as a ChatGPT flaw that exposed payment details and chat titles. Core privacy threats include re-identification (reconstructing identities from anonymized data), data leakage (unauthorized exposure), and memorization of private data, which undermines the 'right to be forgotten.' To mitigate these risks, organizations are implementing input guardrails like anonymization, access controls, and input filtering. Output guardrails include response filtering, differential privacy during training, policy-based refusals, and red-teaming to detect leaks. High-profile incidents\u2014Italy\u2019s 2023 ChatGPT ban over GDPR violations, Samsung\u2019s internal AI ban, and U.S. FTC investigations\u2014have driven global regulatory scrutiny. Recommendations for responsible deployment include adopting Privacy-by-Design, implementing robust input/output safeguards, complying with evolving regulations (e.g., GDPR, EU AI Act), conducting regular audits, and ensuring transparency and user control. Tools like Guardrails AI and AWS Bedrock Guardrails provide scalable, code-based guardrails to enforce privacy policies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 05:49 PM\nSource:[dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/guardrails-for-ai-privacy)\n\n**Preventing Legal Risks of Artificial Intelligence**\nThe Chinese State Council\u2019s opinion on \"Deepening the Implementation of the \u2018Artificial Intelligence+\u2019 Action Plan\" stresses the need to \"\u5b8c\u5584\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u51c6\u5219\u7b49\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5065\u5eb7\u53d1\u5c55\u76f8\u5173\u7acb\u6cd5\u5de5\u4f5c\"\u30101\u3011. The article argues that generative AI brings technological change but also a series of legal and ethical challenges, including governance concepts and specific legal rules. It calls for a dual approach: 1) soft\u2011law governance through voluntary guidelines issued by enterprises, stakeholder groups and standard\u2011setting bodies; 2) hard\u2011law regulation enacted by legislatures to define rights, obligations and prohibitions, covering AI\u2011specific rules as well as traditional areas such as tort, contract, labor and intellectual\u2011property law\u30102\u3011.\n\nEthical concerns are highlighted, noting that generative AI can deepen algorithmic opacity and bias, potentially exacerbating discrimination in hiring and other domains\u30103\u3011. The article cites international precedents such as Japan\u2019s 1988 \"Robot Law Ten Principles\", South Korea\u2019s 2012 \"Robot Ethics Charter\", the EU\u2019s 2016 draft civil\u2011law rules for robots, and the UK Standards Association\u2019s 2016 guide on ethical design of robots and machine systems\u30104\u3011. It criticises these guidelines for lacking enforceability, often rendering them \"\u6beb\u65e0\u4ef7\u503c\"\u30105\u3011.\n\nIntellectual\u2011property issues are discussed through three main points: unauthorized data use, ownership of AI\u2011generated content, and third\u2011party IP protection. The article references the 2023\u201101 lawsuit by Getty Images against Stability AI for training on millions of images without consent\u30106\u3011, and the concern that AI\u2011generated text may replicate copyrighted material, requiring permission from rights holders\u30107\u3011.\n\nPrivacy and personal\u2011data protection are illustrated by the 2023\u201103\u201131 Italian data\u2011protection authority (Garante) emergency decision to block OpenAI\u2019s use of Italian users\u2019 personal data, leading OpenAI to suspend Italian access to ChatGPT\u30108\u3011. The article lists four GDPR\u2011based reasons for the ban: lack of age verification, inaccurate data handling, lack of user notice, and absence of a legal basis for data processing\u30109\u3011.\n\nOverall, the piece calls for a coordinated effort among legislators, technologists, enterprises and regulators to create a legal framework that protects creators, users and society while enabling responsible AI development\u301010\u3011.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 02:02 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-09-26/doc-infrurfw0632453.shtml)\n\n**Anthropic\u2019s New Privacy Policy and the Global AI Data\u2011Training Landscape**\nAnthropic, the AI firm valued at over $180\u202fbillion, announced on early September that it would prohibit Chinese\u2011controlled entities and overseas branches from using its Claude series.  The company also quietly amended its privacy policy: from 28\u202fSeptember, all personal users of Claude (Free, Pro, Max) must decide whether to allow their dialogue and coding data to be used for model training.  If a user does not click the \u2018opt\u2011out\u2019 button, the data is automatically authorised for training; data from users who \u2018agree\u2019 is retained for five years, while data from those who \u2018disagree\u2019 is kept for only thirty days.  The change does not affect enterprise customers (Claude for Work, Claude Gov, Claude for Education) or API users via Google, Amazon, etc.\n\nThe article notes that Anthropic\u2019s move mirrors the standard adopted by other AI leaders, who have long faced a shortage of high\u2011quality training data.  It cites the 2023 OpenAI policy: paid or explicitly refusing users\u2019 data are excluded from training, whereas free or low\u2011pay users are included unless they opt\u2011out.  OpenAI\u2019s 2023 policy change allowed all ChatGPT users to disable chat logs, and the company announced a future ChatGPT Business that would not use user data for training by default.\n\nChina\u2019s own regulatory framework is referenced: the 2024 standard TC260\u2011003 requires user\u2011authorised records for using input data, and a clause that users must be able to disable training within four clicks from the main interface.  The article reports that most domestic models comply with the authorisation clause but fall short of the \u2018easy opt\u2011out\u2019 requirement.\n\nThe piece also reviews privacy\u2011related incidents: in September\u202f2024, ByteDance researchers found that large\u2011language models could be coaxed into revealing private data; in August\u202f2025, OpenAI and xAI accidentally exposed tens of thousands of user conversations to search engines, with OpenAI leaking over 70\u202f000 chats and xAI over 370\u202f000.  A July\u202f2025 incident involved a romance\u2011AI app that stored 160\u202f000 user chats on a publicly accessible Google Drive, exposing sensitive content.\n\nData quality issues are highlighted: a 2024 study found that GPT\u20114o\u2019s Chinese token set contained 23\u202f% pollution from illegal ads, whereas domestic models such as Qwen and Baichuan had far lower contamination rates.  The article stresses that synthetic data can degrade model performance: a 2023 paper warned that training on generated data causes models to \u2018forget\u2019, and a 2024 Nature paper demonstrated that nine iterations of synthetic\u2011data\u2011only training can collapse a model into gibberish.  Meta\u2019s 2024 research showed that even 1\u202f% synthetic data could destabilise a model.\n\nOverall, the article argues that while AI firms are lowering privacy safeguards to secure training data, the reality is that real\u2011human interaction data remains essential for building useful models.\n\nKey metrics and quotes:\n- Anthropic\u2019s new policy: 5\u2011year retention for \u2018agree\u2019 users, 30\u2011day retention for \u2018disagree\u2019 users.\n- TC260\u2011003 clause: \u2018\u5173\u95ed\u65b9\u5f0f\u5e94\u4fbf\u6377\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u91c7\u7528\u9009\u9879\u65b9\u5f0f\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4ece\u670d\u52a1\u4e3b\u754c\u9762\u5f00\u59cb\u5230\u8fbe\u8be5\u9009\u9879\u6240\u9700\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc74\u6b21\u70b9\u51fb\u2019.\n- OpenAI\u2019s 2023 policy: \u2018\u4ed8\u8d39\u6216\u8005\u660e\u786e\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u5176\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f4e\u4ed8\u8d39\u548c\u514d\u8d39\u7528\u6237\u82e5\u4e0d\u4e3b\u52a8\u70b9\u51fb\u754c\u9762\u7684\u2018\u62d2\u7edd\u2019\u6309\u94ae\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5c06\u5176\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u2019.\n- ByteDance 2024 test scores: Google Gemini\u20111.5\u2011flash 99.8, Moonshot_8k_v 99.7, GPT\u20114o 99.6.\n- OpenAI incident: 70\u202f000+ chats leaked; xAI incident: 370\u202f000+ chats leaked.\n- Synthetic\u2011data collapse: 9 iterations \u2192 model collapse; 1\u202f% synthetic data \u2192 potential collapse.\n- Quote: '\u6211\u60f3\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u52a0\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u6ca1\u6709\u90a3\u4e48\u654f\u611f\u3002' \u2013 Li Yanhong.\n- Quote: '\u662f\u5426\u540c\u610f\u8ba9\u81ea\u5df1\u4e0eAI\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u7b49\u4e92\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3' \u2013 Anthropic policy wording.\n\nEnglishtitle: \"Anthropic\u2019s New Privacy Policy and the Global AI Data\u2011Training Landscape\"\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 11:45 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8mkDDlAheQX)\n\n**ChatGPT's New Teen Safety Measures Include Age Verification  --  Here's Why That's Not Enough**\nOpenAI has announced a new teen\u2011specific account for users aged 13\u201117, aimed at enhancing safety for minors. According to CEO Sam Altman in a blog post, the teen account will impose tighter restrictions than adult accounts, such as disabling flirtatious content and banning discussions about suicide or self\u2011harm, even in creative writing. The system will also attempt to contact parents if suicidal ideation is detected and may involve authorities in cases of imminent harm. Altman said the company is building an age\u2011prediction model that defaults to the under\u201118 experience when uncertain, and may request ID in some jurisdictions, citing a trade\u2011off between privacy and protection. The teen account will block graphic sexual content and allow parents to set blackout hours. Critics argue that teens could still falsify age information and question the accuracy of AI\u2011based age detection, especially given the rapid evolution of teen slang. The article cites a 2024 report from Aura that messages in generative\u2011AI companion apps for teens were ten times longer than texts to friends, highlighting heavy reliance on AI. Dr. Scott Kollins, Aura\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, warned that age verification guardrails and screen\u2011time tools alone are insufficient to curb early overuse, calling for parental involvement and education about safer online habits. The piece concludes that while the new measures are a step forward, they may not fully address the broader issue of teen mental health risks associated with AI chatbots.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 07:21 PM\nSource:[SheKnows](https://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1234925446/chatgpt-new-teen-safety-age-verification/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasters agree that as of October 2025, there is no US federal law restricting API access to generative AI systems by geography. Across perspectives\u2014cybersecurity, technology regulation, US-China tech policy, international relations, export control law, and STS/responsible innovation\u2014all note that current regulatory and legislative activity is overwhelmingly focused on age verification, content moderation, youth safety, and harms from generative AI, not on restricting access to US users only. While there is increased national security concern surrounding foreign misuse (notably by China and Russia) and historical precedent for export controls on sensitive technologies, experts note that such restrictions have rarely extended to general-purpose cloud APIs and are typically targeted at specific adversaries or sanctioned countries, not at the entire non-US world. The technical and commercial feasibility of API geo-fencing is questioned, with most providers and policymakers aware that VPN circumvention limits its effectiveness\u2014plus strong economic incentives run against blanket geographic restrictions. The base rate for imposing such sweeping restrictions on digital software and APIs is extremely low in the US outside of acute wartime or crisis contexts. Most experts state that for a YES outcome\u2014a law mandating API geo-restriction before 2026\u2014a major, rapid-response scenario (such as a catastrophic national security incident or foreign abuse triggering emergency legislation/executive action) would be needed. There is no evidence of imminent bills or executive orders targeting API access by geography. With only about 2.5 months until year-end, the dominant view is that the status quo will hold and the probability of legal US-only API restrictions for generative AI before 2026 is low\u2014mostly in the 6% to 18% range\u2014with a median around 10%. The consensus is: absent a dramatic catalyzing event, no such federal requirement will emerge before the deadline.",
