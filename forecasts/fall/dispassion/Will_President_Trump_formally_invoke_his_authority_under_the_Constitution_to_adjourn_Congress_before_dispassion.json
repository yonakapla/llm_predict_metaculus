Additionally, the legal and political risks to the President are so severe, and the practical payoff so uncertain, that even an executive as norm-breaking as Trump has so far shied away from actually attempting this formal step. The difference between the current situation and past standoffs is not sufficient to raise the probability as high as 3%, especially given that no credible reporting indicates the required deadlock is imminent or that formal invocation is actively being prepared.

The decision, based on violations of the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause and federal law, declared all actions stemming from Halligan's appointment unlawful and voided the cases 'without prejudice,' allowing the Justice Department to refile with a different prosecutor. Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal, asserting Halligan, now designated a special U.S. attorney, can continue prosecuting. Both Comey and James welcomed the ruling; Comey called the case 'a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence,' while James' attorney pledged to challenge any future politically motivated charges. The case arose after Trump pressured the Justice Department to pursue high-profile figures who criticized him, including Comey, who led the Russia investigation and called Trump unfit, and James, who sued Trump's real estate company over fraud. Halligan, appointed after her predecessor Erik Siebert refused to pursue charges due to lack of credible evidence, secured indictments swiftly despite opposition from career prosecutors. Her appointment was challenged on grounds that repeated interim appointments circumvent Senate confirmation.

The judge found that Halligan\u2019s appointment violated both the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause, as the 120-day statutory window for interim appointments had expired on May 21, more than four months before her September 22 installation.

The judge rejected the Attorney General\u2019s attempt to retroactively ratify her actions, stating such validation would allow any private citizen to secure indictments with post-hoc approval. As a result, both indictments were dismissed without prejudice, though re-indictment of Comey is unlikely due to the September 30 statute of limitations having passed. The dismissal marks the fourth time a Trump administration interim U.S. attorney has been ruled unlawfully appointed, following similar rulings against Alina Habba (New Jersey), Sigal Chattah (Nevada), and Bill Essayli (Los Angeles), all due to circumvention of Senate confirmation. Legal observers interpret the pattern as judicial resistance to executive overreach in filling U.S. attorney roles through temporary appointments.

The judge found that the Attorney General\u2019s authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney is limited to 120 days under subsection (a), and that under subsection (d), the district court must appoint a replacement once that period expires\u2014rendering Halligan\u2019s appointment unlawful. As a result, the indictment was dismissed without prejudice. The Department of Justice (DOJ), represented by former Chief of Staff Chad Mizelle, argued the ruling was incorrect, stating that both indictments were ratified by senior DOJ leadership, including the Attorney General, and that an appeal is forthcoming. The case, United States v. Comey, No. 1:25-cr-00272-MSN-WEF, is in the Alexandria Division of the Eastern District of Virginia.

The controversy stems from the transition after Erik Siebert\u2019s 120-day interim term expired; while Siebert resigned, President Trump claimed he fired him, asserting that Halligan was necessary to pursue a 'GREAT' mortgage fraud case against James.

Halligan, a former personal attorney for President Donald Trump, was named interim U.S. Attorney in September 2024 to lead both investigations despite lacking prior prosecutorial experience. The judge, Cameron McGown Currie, concluded that Halligan 'did not have legal authority' to file charges against Comey or James.

The decision, based on violations of the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause and federal law, declared all actions stemming from Halligan's appointment unlawful and voided the cases 'without prejudice,' allowing the Justice Department to refile with a different prosecutor. Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal, asserting Halligan, now designated a special U.S. attorney, can continue prosecuting. Both Comey and James welcomed the ruling; Comey called the case 'a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence,' while James' attorney pledged to challenge any future politically motivated charges. The case arose after Trump pressured the Justice Department to pursue high-profile figures who criticized him, including Comey, who led the Russia investigation and called Trump unfit, and James, who sued Trump's real estate company over fraud. Halligan, appointed after her predecessor Erik Siebert refused to pursue charges due to lack of credible evidence, secured indictments swiftly despite opposition from career prosecutors.

The court determined that only judges of the eastern district of Virginia can appoint an interim U.S. attorney until Senate confirmation, and Halligan\u2019s appointment exceeded the 120-day limit for such interim roles, rendering her appointment unlawful. As a result, all actions taken under her authority\u2014including the indictments\u2014were deemed invalid. Judge Currie emphasized that allowing the government to appoint any private citizen as interim U.S. attorney, even temporarily, would undermine the rule of law, stating such a practice 'cannot be the law.' Letitia James welcomed the decision, calling it a 'victory' and affirming her resolve to continue fighting for New Yorkers. Comey, in an Instagram video, expressed gratitude, calling the prosecution 'a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump,' and labeled it as driven by 'malevolence and incompetence.' The White House announced it would appeal the ruling, with Attorney General Pam Bondi stating the government would take 'all available legal action' to hold Comey and James accountable. Comey faced charges of leaking information to reporters in 2017 and making false statements to Congress; James was accused of false statements to a financial institution and bank fraud, both of which they denied. Trump had repeatedly demanded prosecutions of Comey and James, calling them 'guilty as hell' in a Truth Social post, though the Justice Department argued these were opinions, not directives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 12:15 AM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/court-quashes-comey-and-letitia-james-cases-trumps-interim-attorney-pick-ruled-invalid-white-house-to-appeal/articleshow/125552627.cms)\n\n**Prosecuting People out of Rage Isn't a Good Legal Strategy**\nJudge Cameron McGowan Currie dismissed federal prosecutions against James Comey and Letitia James, ruling that the appointment of Lindsay Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was unconstitutional and invalid. The appointment, made under a law allowing interim appointments during vacancies, was deemed unlawful because the vacancy was self-created by President Donald Trump\u2019s removal of the duly appointed U.S. attorney, Erik Seibert, who resigned over ethical concerns. Halligan, an inexperienced insurance lawyer handpicked by Trump and appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, lacked proper Senate confirmation and was not a qualified federal prosecutor. The judge found that Halligan\u2019s appointment violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which mandates Senate confirmation for 'officers of the United States' unless otherwise established by law. Because the appointment was invalid from the outset, all subsequent actions\u2014including securing and signing the indictments\u2014were void ab initio. Currie rejected Bondi\u2019s attempt to retroactively reclassify Halligan as a 'special attorney' to cure the defect, warning that such a practice would allow unqualified individuals to secure indictments with mere post-hoc approval. The dismissals were made 'without prejudice,' allowing the Justice Department to re-file charges with a properly appointed U.S. attorney. However, for Comey, the statute of limitations for his offense\u2014making false statements to Congress\u2014expired on September 30, 2025, and Currie noted that invalid indictments cannot freeze the statute of limitations, potentially barring re-prosecution. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Halligan was 'legally appointed' and vowed an appeal. The judge also left unresolved the question of whether the prosecutions were vindictive and selective, which is now moot in these cases, though a similar issue is being examined in the case of Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, where a hearing is scheduled to determine if there is a 'realistic likelihood of vindictiveness.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 11:51 PM\nSource:[NYMag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-halligan-bondi-comey-james-dismissal.html)\n\n**Congress Leadership Breaks with Government Leaders, Signaling Strained Relations with the Planalto**\nThe relationship between Brazil's Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto and the leadership of Congress has significantly deteriorated, as revealed by public statements from key figures in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.

Halligan, a former personal lawyer for Trump with no prosecutorial experience, was appointed after Trump ousted the legally appointed interim U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, whose 120-day term had expired. Under federal law, once the 120-day window ends, only the federal district court may appoint an interim U.S. attorney. Since Halligan was neither confirmed by the Senate nor appointed by the court, Judge Currie held she lacked legal authority. As a result, she dismissed indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, which Halligan had filed on Trump\u2019s behalf. The judge ruled without prejudice, meaning new indictments could theoretically be filed by a validly appointed prosecutor. The decision was grounded in statutory text, legislative history\u2014including statements by Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2014and the constitutional principle that principal officers like U.S. attorneys require Senate confirmation. The ruling also addressed the statute of limitations, noting that a six-month grace period exists after a defective indictment is dismissed, allowing a valid prosecutor to refile. The case may be appealed, potentially reaching the Supreme Court, where Republican-appointed justices have previously shown deference to Trump\u2019s executive actions. However, the ruling underscores that the president cannot bypass Congress and the judiciary to install partisan loyalists as prosecutors for political retaliation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 10:04 PM\nSource:[Slate Magazine](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/11/comey-lindsey-halligan-tish-james-fake-prosecutor.html)\n\n**Prosecutor Lindsey Halligan Disqualified for Unlawful Appointment, All Cases Dismissed**\nU.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled on November 24, 2025, that Lindsey Halligan was unlawfully appointed as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, disqualifying her from prosecuting cases and invalidating all actions taken under her appointment.

The decision stemmed from the judge\u2019s conclusion that Lindsey Halligan, a former personal attorney of Trump, was improperly appointed as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in September 2024. Halligan, who had no prior prosecutorial experience, was appointed without Senate confirmation and was later named lead prosecutor in both cases. The judge found that Halligan lacked legal authority to bring charges, calling the actions 'illegal exercises of executive power' and invalidating all proceedings based on her appointment. The ruling was issued after Comey and James sued the Department of Justice, arguing that Halligan\u2019s appointment violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause and federal law, which limits interim appointments to 120 days and requires Senate confirmation for permanent roles. The judge dismissed the cases 'without prejudice,' allowing the Department of Justice to refile with a properly appointed prosecutor. Letitia James expressed gratitude, stating she was 'encouraged by today\u2019s victory' and would continue to fight any politically motivated charges.

Trump had directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to appoint Halligan after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, refused to file charges due to lack of credible evidence. Siebert had initially been appointed for 120 days and later reappointed by the court, but the Senate never confirmed him. Bondi attempted to legitimize the cases by separately naming Halligan as a special prosecutor and ratifying the charges. Comey and James\u2019 legal teams argued the cases were retaliatory, driven by political animosity toward Trump\u2019s critics.

He claimed that tariffs\u2014already generating 'historic levels' of revenue\u2014would soon 'SKYROCKET' as importers' inventory stockpiles diminish, resulting in 'RECORD SETTING' tax receipts and a 'new and unprecedented course' for the U.S. economy. Trump described the case as 'LIFE OR DEATH' for the nation and expressed eagerness for the Court\u2019s ruling to allow the continuation of his 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN' agenda. The case centers on whether Trump can legally invoke the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs, a power constitutionally reserved to Congress except in 'unusual and extraordinary' circumstances. The Supreme Court, with three of Trump\u2019s appointees\u2014Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett\u2014heard arguments nearly three weeks prior. Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether tariffs, as taxes on Americans, should be subject to congressional authority, while Gorsuch expressed concern that upholding the administration\u2019s interpretation would create a 'one-way ratchet' toward unchecked executive power.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) faced sharp criticism from Democrats, including Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), who called Johnson 'the most disappointing member of the U.S. Congress,' accusing him of failing to make up for 53 days of inactivity. The shutdown began after the House passed a continuing resolution (CR) on September 19, 2024, and then left Washington, forcing the Senate to spend 53 days crafting a compromise. The House only returned to approve the final bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law on Wednesday night. The new CR expires on January 30, 2026, creating another deadline. Democrats argue this pattern\u2014leaving for extended recesses while the government remains unfunded\u2014subordinates Congress to executive authority, with Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) stating the House has become 'an organ of Article II' rather than an independent Article I institution, calling it a 'double whammy on our democracy.' Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and others believe Johnson delayed swearing in Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) to stall a discharge petition demanding the release of the 'Epstein files,' which were later released, including new emails naming Trump. Democrats claim Johnson lied repeatedly during press conferences, used extreme rhetoric (e.g., 'Marxist,' 'communist'), and imposed unnecessary security barriers, causing staff to wait 30\u201345 minutes to enter the Capitol. Despite this, Democrats say the shutdown energized the public, with Rep. Johnson stating Americans are 'more aware of the stakes' and increasingly engaged in the fight against policies favoring billionaires and tariffs on everyday citizens. Republicans, including Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI), defend the CR as 'monumental' and argue that the nine remaining appropriations bills are already finalized, so the recess did not hinder progress. The article ends with a Democratic call to action: 'We work every day to do something. Anything \u2014 or, you know, get caught trying.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/us-house-vacation/)\n\n**Congress is on 'the path to irrelevance'**\nThe article argues that the U.S. Congress is on 'the path to irrelevance' amid a federal government shutdown that has lasted over a month, with the House of Representatives in recess for more than 40 days\u2014the longest such break outside of standard recess periods. Despite the constitutional obligation to meet and end the shutdown, the House has not convened for votes, and Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, leaving her district without representation since March. The Senate, by contrast, has continued to operate, holding votes on judicial nominations, defense authorization, and tariff policy, and engaging in bipartisan negotiations. The article, authored by Charlie Hunt, Associate Professor of Political Science at Boise State University, traces Congress\u2019s decline to decades of erosion in its authority, beginning with the founders' intent to make Congress the preeminent branch of government, with control over lawmaking and the 'power of the purse' to limit executive power. However, under President Trump\u2019s first 100 days and beyond, Congress has increasingly ceded authority to the executive, allowing over 210 executive orders to be issued\u2014faster than any president since FDR\u2014and enabling the defunding or elimination of major agencies like USAID and the CFPB. The article attributes Congress\u2019s weakening to political nationalization, which has shifted focus from local representation to national party politics, diminishing members\u2019 independence and public trust. Additionally, Congress has abdicated its war powers by relying on presidential authorizations rather than declaring war, and has allowed presidential control over budget negotiations, undermining local representation. The result, the author warns, is an 'Imperial Presidency' with unchecked power and diminished accountability, threatening the constitutional balance of power.

Michael Seabright, ruled that Bilal Essayli, a Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney for the Central District of California (CDCal), was improperly appointed under Sections 546 and 3345 of federal law and thus disqualified from serving as interim or acting U.S. attorney. However, the judge upheld the validity of indictments brought in CDCal because the authority to prosecute derives from the Attorney General, not the district U.S. attorney. Consequently, even though Essayli is ineligible to hold the position, the court could not prevent him from functioning as de facto U.S. attorney as First Assistant U.S. Attorney (FAUSA), a role granted by Attorney General Pamela Bondi and not subject to the same constitutional appointment requirements. The ruling highlights a constitutional and statutory tension: while the Appointments Clause requires Senate confirmation for district U.S. attorneys, Congress has granted the Attorney General broad authority to appoint interim or acting officials during vacancies. President Trump\u2019s strategy of using such appointments to place loyalists in key positions undermines the Senate\u2019s advice-and-consent power. The ruling leaves no immediate remedy unless Congress acts. Meanwhile, in the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVa), former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James are challenging indictments brought by interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan, whose appointment may also be invalid. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie has ordered the government to provide sealed grand jury transcripts and documents on Halligan\u2019s involvement in the proceedings, as her personal role in presenting the case to the grand jury could render the indictment void. If dismissed, the government could re-indict under Section 3288 of the federal criminal code, which allows a six-month window to refile after a dismissal post-statute-of-limitations. The article concludes with a call for Congress to amend DOJ statutes to prevent the president from bypassing Senate confirmation by limiting the Attorney General\u2019s interim appointment power after six months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 04:37 PM\nSource:[National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/10/the-curious-fallout-from-a-trump-appointees-partial-disqualification/)\n\n**Trump has successfully mounted a coup thanks to one man**\nAccording to the article published on October 27, 2025, by Alternet, Speaker Mike Johnson, acting under what is described as Donald Trump\u2019s direction, has unconstitutionally kept the U.S. House of Representatives in an indefinite recess for over a month, violating Article I, Section 5, Clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits adjournment for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber. This unprecedented action has halted all legislative functions, including committee work, the introduction of bills, oversight hearings, and the seating of elected members like Adelita Grijalva. The article claims this move effectively eliminates congressional oversight, allowing Trump to act without restraint\u2014such as demolishing parts of the White House to build a 'replica of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Winter Palace\u2019s Grand Throne Room' for billionaire fundraisers\u2014without legal or political accountability. The author argues that Johnson\u2019s actions constitute a 'procedural coup,' enabling Trump to consolidate near-dictatorial power by nullifying Congress\u2019s constitutional role in checking executive authority, especially in matters of funding and lawmaking (per Article I, Clause 1). The article further contends that this paralysis undermines the separation of powers, normalizes unchecked executive authority, and threatens the foundations of American democracy, with no meaningful response from the mainstream press. The piece frames Johnson\u2019s actions as a deliberate, unconstitutional strategy to empower Trump, citing the absence of any joint resolution or Senate approval for such a prolonged recess, which has never occurred in U.S. history\u2014even during major crises like the Civil War or WWII.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/trump-coup-johnson/)\n\n**Thanks to one man, Trump has successfully mounted a coup**\nOn October 26, 2025, Raw Story published an article alleging that Donald Trump has effectively executed a 'coup' by leveraging Speaker Mike Johnson to keep the U.S. House of Representatives in an indefinite recess since mid-October, violating Article I, Section 5, Clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits either house from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other. The article claims this unprecedented action\u2014lasting over a month without pro forma sessions, blocking the seating of elected members like Adelita Grijalva, and halting committee work\u2014has eliminated congressional oversight, enabling Trump to act without restraint. The author argues that Trump\u2019s plan to demolish part of the White House and replace it with a replica of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Winter Palace Grand Throne Room\u2014dubbed the 'Epstein Ballroom'\u2014was carried out without proper authorization from the National Capital Planning Commission or the National Trust for Historic Preservation, exploiting legal loopholes. The article cites James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to emphasize the Founders' intent that Congress must check executive power. It further claims that without a functioning House, no revenue bills can originate, rendering the Senate powerless to constrain Trump\u2019s actions. The piece frames Johnson\u2019s actions as a 'procedural coup' that has paralyzed Congress, allowing unaccountable executive authority and normalizing a de facto monarchy, with the potential for Trump to declare himself king. The article also notes growing concern among some Republicans, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massey, who are beginning to challenge Trump, but argues that the mainstream press has failed to recognize the constitutional crisis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 02:02 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/thanks-to-one-man-trump-has-finally-mounted-a-coup/)\n\n**Trump could 'keep getting stronger' unless this 'vital check' is restored: WSJ**\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial argues that Senate dysfunction has eroded the \"advise and consent\" check on presidential power, allowing President Trump\u2019s administration to strengthen its authority. It cites that a majority of presidential appointees in the last three administrations were approved by unanimous consent, yet the Trump administration has had to staff some executive offices with temporary leaders because of the resulting logjam. The editorial states, 'As Congress sinks further into dysfunction, the Presidency keeps getting stronger,' and warns that the GOP\u2019s frustration could pressure the Senate to grant recess appointments en masse, a move the editorial claims would be a dereliction of constitutional duty and would leave the GOP powerless to curb Trump\u2019s actions. It notes that Trump has used vacancy laws to keep U.S. Attorneys on the job despite no confirmation votes, a practice currently being challenged in court, and urges the Senate to take a holiday to allow such appointments. The piece concludes by referencing Attorney General Matt Gaetz as an example of the potential consequences of unchecked executive power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 01:21 AM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-2673968829/)\n\n**The right way to unblock the Senate's 'confirmation constipation'**\nThe New York Post article argues that the Senate\u2019s confirmation process is stalling President Donald Trump\u2019s appointments, citing that by the second\u2011third of his first year he has filled only about 100 of the 700 open positions, excluding judicial appointments. It notes that Trump\u2019s four\u2011year term has seen a slowdown in confirmations, undermining the presidency\u2019s ability to staff its team. The piece explains that the Senate historically used unanimous consent to approve uncontroversial nominees, a practice that has eroded in 2025 as Democrats use procedural roadblocks. It warns that expanding the Senate\u2019s role to confirm too many \u2018inferior officers\u2019 wastes time and hampers government function, and that the Constitution does not require such confirmations for all positions. The article cites Trump\u2019s January attempt to force a recess so he could appoint a full Cabinet of temporary picks, which backfired and eroded Senate trust. It describes current negotiations, where Republicans have tied nomination progress to unrelated budget demands, and notes that the Senate\u2019s \u2018blue slip\u2019 tradition remains a point of contention. The author calls for a rule change\u2014bringing nominees to the floor in packages\u2014to streamline confirmations, but cautions that the \u2018nuclear option\u2019 should be used sparingly. The piece concludes that the Senate should not surrender more power to Congress and that the president should retain control over middle\u2011management appointments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 10:11 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/09/05/opinion/the-right-way-to-unblock-the-senates-confirmation-constipation/)\n\n**Senate Breaks for Summer After Failed Negotiations to Confirm Nominees**\nThe Senate adjourned for the summer on Aug. 2 after failing to reach an agreement to confirm dozens of Trump nominees. Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) floated the option of recess appointments, but that would have required an adjournment of at least 10 days. Instead, the Senate agreed to recess with pro-forma sessions every three days, making it impossible for Trump to make recess appointments before the Senate reassembles in September. Republicans are considering a Senate rule change to speed up the confirmation of presidential nominees. Trump criticized an offer made by Senate Democrats, accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) of 'political extortion' by requesting additional federal funding in exchange for confirming nominees. Schumer responded by urging Republicans to work with Democrats on a 'reasonable path' to confirm the nominees. The Senate voted to advance seven Trump nominees before adjourning for the summer.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 04, 2025 12:08 PM\nSource:[The Political Insider](https://thepoliticalinsider.com/senate-breaks-for-summer-after-failed-negotiations-to-confirm-nominees/)\n\n**Mike Lee drafts adjournment resolution to allow Trump to make recess appointments**\nSenator Mike Lee has drafted an adjournment resolution to allow President Trump to make recess appointments if Senate Democrats continue to stall on confirmation. Lee stated, 'I've drafted an adjournment resolution, one that would allow President Trump to invoke his recess appointment powers.' He emphasized that Senate Republicans are 'ready, willing and able' to confirm Trump's picks and will either confirm them or 'have them recess appointed.' Lee also highlighted the need to address the 'backlog' of nominees, with nearly 160 pending, and encouraged constituents to contact their senators to prioritize Trump's nominees.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 03, 2025 07:03 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3489728/mike-lee-draft-adjournment-resolution-trump-recess-appointments/)\n\n**Senate GOP threatens to 'grind it out' through August as Trump nominees face Democratic delays**\nSenate Republicans are threatening to 'grind it out' through August to confirm President Trump's nominees, which are being delayed by Democrats. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, 'We've seen an unprecedented level of obstruction and delay in blocking from Democrats. And as a consequence of that, we've had to kind of grind through. And that's what we're going to keep doing.' Thune also noted that the Senate has never failed to confirm any of an executive's nominees on a fast track. Republicans are discussing parliamentary options to make long-term changes to rules and precedents to speedily confirm nominees, and some are even suggesting the possibility of 'recess appointments' to install some of Trump's picks without Senate confirmation. However, the Constitution requires both the House and Senate to be adjourned for 10 days before a recess appointment can be made, and it's unclear if the Senate will recess for August.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 01:21 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-gop-threatens-grind-out-through-august-trump-nominees-face-democratic-delays)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts overwhelmingly agree that it is extremely unlikely President Trump will formally invoke his constitutional authority under Article II, Section 3 to adjourn Congress before January 1, 2026. The most commonly cited reasons for this include (1) the total historical absence of precedent\u2014this power has never been invoked by any president, even under dire executive-legislative conflict, (2) stringent constitutional and procedural barriers, namely that both the House and Senate must publicly and formally disagree on adjournment timing\u2014an outcome Congress can and routinely does avoid by holding pro forma sessions or minimal agreements, (3) severe legal and political risks of invocation, such as triggering a constitutional crisis, fomenting widespread institutional and public backlash, and immediate judicial challenges, and (4) strong incentives among congressional leadership, regardless of party, to avoid ceding such power to the executive. While Trump's history of norm-breaking, the current atmosphere of extreme congressional dysfunction, and his public threats to use this power marginally increase the risk compared to any previous era, none of the experts identified credible evidence that the necessary procedural conditions are, or are likely to be, created. Even amid record House recesses and open executive frustration, Congress shows every sign of holding to longstanding practices that prevent a formal dispute over adjournment timing. Experts assign a very low but non-zero probability to formal invocation\u2014typically 1-3%\u2014to reflect unprecedented polarization, Trump's willingness for brinkmanship, and unusual recent dysfunction. The uniform consensus, however, is that the base rate (never having happened) and persistent institutional incentives make a Yes outcome extremely improbable, and the status quo will almost certainly persist through the question's resolution.",
