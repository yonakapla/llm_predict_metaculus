[Deepchecks describes](https://deepchecks.com/glossary/model-parameters/) parameters as follows:\n\n>The weights and coefficients that the algorithm extracts from the data are known as model parameters. Model parameters of neural networks consider how the predictor variable influences the target variable.\n\nIn other words the model [learns these parameters during training](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-model-parameters-vs-hyperparameters/) to fit the input data to the appropriate output.\n\nIn recent years the number of parameters used in ML models [has increased rapidly](https://epochai.org/blog/machine-learning-model-sizes-and-the-parameter-gap). But, as discussed in [this writeup](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/midXmMb2Xg37F2Kgn/new-scaling-laws-for-large-language-models) (and also [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Fpvch8RR29qLEWNH/chinchilla-s-wild-implications)), research by DeepMind published in the spring of 2022, along with a model named [Chinchilla](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/an-empirical-analysis-of-compute-optimal-large-language-model-training), suggested that the importance of dataset size relative to parameter count had been underestimated in previous work.\n\n>On March 29th, DeepMind published a paper, \"Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models\", that shows that essentially everyone -- OpenAI, DeepMind, Microsoft, etc. -- has been training large language models with a deeply suboptimal use of compute.\n>\n>Following the new scaling laws that they propose for the optimal use of compute, DeepMind trains a new, 70-billion parameter model that outperforms much larger language models, including the 175-billion parameter GPT-3 and DeepMind's own 270-billion parameter \"Gopher\".\n\nIn March of 2022, a paper describing the [BaGuaLu model](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3503221.3508417) model was published, and discussed a variant of this model trained with 174 trillion parameters. However, this was a [sparse model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961) (seemingly a variant of [mixture of experts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts)), and was primarily a demonstration of the ability to train large scale models.\n\nSparse models activate a smaller share of their parameters in a forward pass, using those that were trained for the task at hand, while dense models use a larger share of their parameters.

Inside the 1-Trillion Parameter Open-Source LLM**\nDeepSeek-V4 MoE is a 1-trillion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model that represents a major breakthrough in scalable, efficient AI development. Unlike dense models, which activate all parameters per token, DeepSeek-V4 activates only about 3% of its total parameters\u2014roughly 32 billion\u2014per token by routing each token through a dynamic mixture of 16 specialized experts. This architecture enables trillion-scale models to remain computationally feasible. The model features a novel Top-16 expert routing system, finer-grained expert segmentation, and shared generalist experts to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency. These innovations allow DeepSeek-V4 to achieve GPT-5-class performance in math, coding, and long-context reasoning while maintaining strong performance on general language tasks. Early evidence shows it outperforms most open models and is competitive with leading closed systems. Its economic advantages are significant: training and inference costs are drastically reduced due to sparsity, with estimates suggesting training costs comparable to other 1T MoEs like Moonshot\u2019s Kimi K2 (~$4.6M), a figure unattainable for dense models at similar scale. DeepSeek-V4\u2019s MIT-style open licensing enables widespread adoption, democratizing access to frontier AI. It stands as a pivotal proof of concept that MoE architectures can deliver high performance, scalability, and affordability\u2014making GPT-5-level capability accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. The model\u2019s techniques, including aux-free load balancing and fine-grained routing, are expected to become standard in future large-scale MoE systems. DeepSeek-V4 is part of a growing wave of Chinese open models, including Qwen-3-Max and Kimi K2, that rival Western closed systems.

HistoNet integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Mamba state-space models to enhance performance through complementary strengths: CNNs extract local features, Transformers capture long-range spatial dependencies, and Mamba enables efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. The model improves interpretability via SHAP-based attribution maps and is lightweight, requiring only 36.12 MB of storage (reducible to 18 MB with FP16 quantization) and 7.208 GFLOPs per inference, making it deployable in resource-limited settings. Evaluated on two datasets\u2014the Architectural Heritage Elements - Image64 Dataset (10 categories, 10,235 images) and the Historical Building Malacca, Malaysia Dataset (49 images of UNESCO World Heritage structures)\u2014HistoNet demonstrates strong generalization across diverse architectural styles, imaging conditions, and geographical regions. The model uses a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline with data partitioning (60% training, 10% validation, 30% testing), class imbalance mitigation via inverse-frequency sampling, and augmentation (random resizing, flipping, rotation). Hyperparameter optimization via Bayesian techniques identified optimal settings: AdamW optimizer with learning rate 1e-3, weight decay 1e-4, batch size 24, cosine annealing with 10-epoch warmup, 8 attention heads, 512 feed-forward dimension, 128 Mamba state-space units, and progressive dropout (0.1, 0.15, 0.3). The model achieved robust performance across tasks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each component. The study concludes that HistoNet systematically addresses prior gaps in accuracy, scalability, interpretability, and accessibility, positioning it as a scalable and trustworthy tool for cultural heritage preservation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26897-y)\n\n**Predefined Vectors for Memory-Efficient Neural Network Training**\nA new methodology called Latent Space Configuration (LSC), proposed by Nikita Gabdullin, an expert at 'Kriptonit', enables neural networks to maintain a fixed model size regardless of the number of classes, solving the scalability issue in machine learning classification tasks. Traditional supervised learning (SL) methods require a classification layer size proportional to the number of classes, making models impractical when dealing with millions of classes\u2014such as in face recognition\u2014due to astronomical memory demands. LSC replaces this approach by projecting inputs (e.g., facial images) into a pre-defined, fixed vector system in abstract latent space. Each class is assigned a unique target vector, and the network learns to map input embeddings as closely as possible to their respective targets while keeping them distant from others. These target vectors are generated using mathematically rigorous constructions like the root system A and its variants, which are uniformly distributed and optimized for separation. This shift from 'one neuron per class' to 'fixed position per class' allows architectures like Vision Transformer (ViT) to remain unchanged even when scaling to 1.28 million classes. In experiments, ViT-S trained with LSC achieved 87.1% accuracy on a 1.28 million-class dataset, demonstrating practical feasibility. Crucially, LSC drastically reduces GPU memory usage: only a small batch of target vectors is loaded per training step, independent of total class count. For example, traditional SL would require a classification layer larger than the backbone model at 100,000 classes, and ViT-B cannot even load a single batch on an A100 40GB GPU with 10 million classes\u2014conditions where LSC remains viable. Additionally, LSC avoids accuracy degradation on known classes when adding new ones, as model parameters remain unchanged. Experiments also show that randomly shuffled vectors (A) outperform uniform distributions in some cases, achieving 87.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K without data augmentation\u2014comparable to traditional cross-entropy methods but without scalability limitations. LSC is not limited to face recognition and applies to any high-class classification task in computer vision, representing a paradigm shift toward scalable, memory-efficient AI systems.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/companies/kryptonite/articles/970844/)\n\n**What Is DeepSeek-V4 MoE?

GPUs, originally designed for gaming, are now the core of AI computation due to their ability to perform parallel mathematical operations at scale, enabling rapid training of deep learning models. Training state-of-the-art AI models requires petabytes of data, specialized hardware like A100, H100, and TPU v5, distributed frameworks such as DeepSpeed and PyTorch, and months of experimentation, costing millions of dollars and thousands of GPU-hours. AI data centers\u2014equipped with high-density GPU racks, liquid cooling, ultra-fast interconnects (InfiniBand, NVLink), and redundant power systems\u2014serve as the physical backbone for AI workloads, designed specifically for continuous, high-load operations. However, AI's massive computational demands come with a significant energy cost: training a single large model can consume as much electricity as a small town uses in a year and produce emissions equivalent to over 100 transatlantic flights. The future of AI depends on renewable-powered data centers, energy-efficient hardware, and optimized training techniques like sparsity and quantization. According to the author, a Director at Perfect Web Solutions and educator with a 30K-subscriber YouTube channel, AI innovation is not just software-driven\u2014it is fundamentally an infrastructure revolution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 10:26 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@farhan.nasir01/the-hidden-infrastructure-powering-modern-ai-71263600d70b)\n\n**What to be thankful for in AI in 2025**\nThe article 'What to be thankful for in AI in 2025' reflects on the year's transformative developments in artificial intelligence, highlighting key advancements across models, ecosystems, and accessibility. OpenAI delivered GPT-5 in August and GPT-5.1 in November, featuring dynamic 'Thinking' and 'Instant' variants that adjust reasoning time per task; despite early issues with math and coding, user feedback led to improvements, and enterprise adoption shows strong results\u2014ZenDesk reports GPT-5-powered agents resolve over 50% of customer tickets, with some cases reaching 80\u201390% resolution. OpenAI also launched GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, a powerful coding model enabling agentic workflows, and ChatGPT Atlas, a browser-integrated assistant with sidebar summaries and on-page analysis. On the media front, Sora 2 evolved into a full video-and-audio model with improved physics, synchronized sound, and a social networking app for user-created TV networks. OpenAI released open-weight models gpt-oss-120B and gpt-oss-20B under an Apache 2.0-style license, marking a significant return to public model sharing. China\u2019s open-model ecosystem, led by DeepSeek and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen family, now slightly surpasses the U.S. in global open-model downloads, with models like Light-R1-32B and VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrating strong performance on limited budgets. Liquid AI introduced the Liquid Foundation Models (LFM2) and LFM2-VL for edge and robotics deployment, with the LFM2-VL-3B targeting embedded systems. Google\u2019s Gemma 3 line, ranging from 270M to 27B parameters, offers open weights and multimodal support, with Gemma 3 270M excelling in fine-tuning and structured text tasks. Google also launched Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image), a high-resolution image generator ideal for infographics and technical visuals. Meta partnered with Midjourney to license its aesthetic technology, integrating it into Facebook, Instagram, and Meta AI\u2014potentially bringing Midjourney-grade visuals into mainstream social platforms. Google\u2019s Gemini 3, promoted as its most capable model yet, includes Deep Think mode and strong performance in reasoning, coding, and multimodal tasks.

Fewer bits reduce computational load, memory movement, and power consumption with minimal impact on performance. This method is increasingly adopted for both training and inference. Core concepts include FLOPs (Floating Point Operations per Second), matrix multiplications (MatMuls), tensors, and bits\u2014where fewer bits enable faster compute and lower memory use. Mixed precision training uses FP16 for computation and FP32 for stability, improving speed while maintaining accuracy. Low-precision formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) reduce compute, memory, and energy costs. Quantization stores and computes with lower-bit numbers, especially useful in inference. Key efficiency metrics include throughput (samples processed per second), latency (time per input), GPU hours (compute cost), and memory bandwidth (data movement speed).

HistoNet integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Mamba state-space models to enhance performance through complementary strengths: CNNs extract local features, Transformers capture long-range spatial dependencies, and Mamba enables efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. The model improves interpretability via SHAP-based attribution maps and is lightweight, requiring only 36.12 MB of storage (reducible to 18 MB with FP16 quantization) and 7.208 GFLOPs per inference, making it deployable in resource-limited settings. Evaluated on two datasets\u2014the Architectural Heritage Elements - Image64 Dataset (10 categories, 10,235 images) and the Historical Building Malacca, Malaysia Dataset (49 images of UNESCO World Heritage structures)\u2014HistoNet demonstrates strong generalization across diverse architectural styles, imaging conditions, and geographical regions. The model uses a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline with data partitioning (60% training, 10% validation, 30% testing), class imbalance mitigation via inverse-frequency sampling, and augmentation (random resizing, flipping, rotation). Hyperparameter optimization via Bayesian techniques identified optimal settings: AdamW optimizer with learning rate 1e-3, weight decay 1e-4, batch size 24, cosine annealing with 10-epoch warmup, 8 attention heads, 512 feed-forward dimension, 128 Mamba state-space units, and progressive dropout (0.1, 0.15, 0.3). The model achieved robust performance across tasks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each component. The study concludes that HistoNet systematically addresses prior gaps in accuracy, scalability, interpretability, and accessibility, positioning it as a scalable and trustworthy tool for cultural heritage preservation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26897-y)\n\n**Large language models versus classical machine learning performance in COVID-19 mortality prediction using high-dimensional tabular data - Scientific Reports**\nA study published in Scientific Reports evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) versus classical machine learning (CML) models in predicting COVID-19 mortality using high-dimensional tabular data from the Tehran COVID-19 cohort, which included 9,134 patients across four tertiary hospitals in Tehran, Iran, from March 2020 to May 2023. The dataset comprised 81 on-admission features, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory results, with a focus on in-hospital mortality. Data preprocessing included handling missing values via iterative imputation (numerical) and KNN (categorical), normalization using a standard scaler, and feature selection using Lasso regularization, reducing the dataset to 40 top-ranked features. Class imbalance was addressed using SMOTE, increasing the training set from 6,118 to 9,760 samples. For LLMs, data were converted into clinical text narratives, excluding negative symptoms and normal lab values due to context window constraints. Five CML models (logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, KNN, random forest, MLP, XGBoost) were trained with hyperparameter optimization via grid search and cross-validation. LLMs tested included open-source models (Mistral-7b, Mixtral 8\u00d77B, Llama3-8b, Llama3-70b) via Poe, proprietary models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o) via OpenAI API, and fine-tuned models (BERT, ClinicalBERT). Zero-shot classification was performed without training, while Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.2 was fine-tuned using QLoRA with 4-bit quantization, mixed-precision training, and gradient accumulation on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and AUC across internal and external validation sets. A 5-fold cross-validation was applied to the training set (n=6,118). SHAP analysis was used to interpret model predictions, with XGBoost serving as the model-agnostic explainer to compute global and individual feature impacts. The study found that CML models outperformed LLMs in predictive accuracy, with XGBoost achieving the highest AUC. However, LLMs demonstrated robust performance in zero-shot settings, particularly GPT-4, though fine-tuning improved results. The influence of training sample size was also analyzed, showing improved performance with larger datasets. The study was conducted under IRB approval (IR.SBMU.RIGLD.REC.004 and IR.SBMU.RIGLD.REC.1399.058), with patient data pseudonymized and protected under the Helsinki Declaration and Iran Ministry of Health regulations. No informed consent was required due to IRB exemption.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26705-7)\n\n**Is the LLM Limit Thesis Real? Meta and Google Researchers Disagree on AI's Next Frontier**\nThe debate over whether large language models (LLMs) have reached a performance ceiling\u2014known as the 'LLM limit thesis'\u2014is intensifying, with prominent AI researchers divided. Yann LeCun, Meta's former AI lead and one of the 'fathers of deep learning,' argues that LLMs are nearing their limits due to their inability to learn from the real world, advocating instead for 'world models' like the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). LeCun plans to leave Meta to found a startup focused on world models, as reported by the Financial Times on November 11, 2025. Similarly, Fei-Fei Li, Stanford University professor and 'AI godmother' known for ImageNet, co-founded World Labs in 2024 to develop a 3D world foundation model. In a June 2025 podcast, Li stated that language is a powerful but insufficient medium for encoding the physical 3D world, reinforcing the need for new architectures. This shift is driven by concerns that the 'scaling law'\u2014the principle that increased compute, model size, and data improve LLM performance\u2014has plateaued. The 2025 release of GPT-4.5, which was 30 times more expensive than GPT-4o yet underperformed, exemplifies this stagnation. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI co-founder, confirmed in December 2024 at NeurIPS 2024 and again in November 2025 on the Dwarkesh Podcast that the 'scaling era' has ended, marking a transition to a 'research era' focused on novel methodologies.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u7d4c\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\uff08xTECH\uff09](https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/00692/112700176/)\n\n**Predefined Vectors for Memory-Efficient Neural Network Training**\nA new methodology called Latent Space Configuration (LSC), proposed by Nikita Gabdullin, an expert at 'Kriptonit', enables neural networks to maintain a fixed model size regardless of the number of classes, solving the scalability issue in machine learning classification tasks. Traditional supervised learning (SL) methods require a classification layer size proportional to the number of classes, making models impractical when dealing with millions of classes\u2014such as in face recognition\u2014due to astronomical memory demands. LSC replaces this approach by projecting inputs (e.g., facial images) into a pre-defined, fixed vector system in abstract latent space. Each class is assigned a unique target vector, and the network learns to map input embeddings as closely as possible to their respective targets while keeping them distant from others. These target vectors are generated using mathematically rigorous constructions like the root system A and its variants, which are uniformly distributed and optimized for separation. This shift from 'one neuron per class' to 'fixed position per class' allows architectures like Vision Transformer (ViT) to remain unchanged even when scaling to 1.28 million classes. In experiments, ViT-S trained with LSC achieved 87.1% accuracy on a 1.28 million-class dataset, demonstrating practical feasibility. Crucially, LSC drastically reduces GPU memory usage: only a small batch of target vectors is loaded per training step, independent of total class count. For example, traditional SL would require a classification layer larger than the backbone model at 100,000 classes, and ViT-B cannot even load a single batch on an A100 40GB GPU with 10 million classes\u2014conditions where LSC remains viable. Additionally, LSC avoids accuracy degradation on known classes when adding new ones, as model parameters remain unchanged. Experiments also show that randomly shuffled vectors (A) outperform uniform distributions in some cases, achieving 87.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K without data augmentation\u2014comparable to traditional cross-entropy methods but without scalability limitations. LSC is not limited to face recognition and applies to any high-class classification task in computer vision, representing a paradigm shift toward scalable, memory-efficient AI systems.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/companies/kryptonite/articles/970844/)\n\n**Rapid thrombogenesis prediction in COVID-19 patients using DNN with data labeling - Scientific Reports**\nA study published in Scientific Reports evaluates deep neural network (DNN) and machine learning (ML) models for predicting rapid thrombogenesis in COVID-19 patients using data labeling and hyperparameter optimization. The research shows that XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9852, followed by DNN with 0.93618, while Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, and k-NN models performed poorly. Accuracy improved with increasing cross-validation (CV) folds up to 6-fold, after which it declined. The average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were low, indicating strong model performance. The study found that at least 30 training data points are required for acceptable accuracy, with diminishing returns beyond that point. Hyperparameter tuning using RayTune optimized XGBoost and DNN models: for XGBoost, optimal parameters included a learning rate (eta) of 0.2\u20130.5, reg_alpha and reg_lambda of 1.0e-3\u201310, max_depth of 3\u20139, and min_child_weight of 1\u201310. For DNN, the optimal configuration included a learning rate of 0.063, 143 epochs, four layers (81, 21, 35, 67 nodes), batch size of 8, and ReLU activation with MSE loss. After increasing the dataset size from 1,408 to 7,040 data points (five patient datasets), accuracy dropped, likely due to patient-specific variability. To address this, a data label column was added to identify individual patient datasets (1\u20135). This labeling significantly improved DNN performance, achieving a test accuracy of 98.49%. Parallel coordinate plots helped identify outliers (e.g., target values of 1.0 at index 124, and 0.6 at indices 115 and 118), but removing them did not improve accuracy. The study concludes that incorporating patient-specific data labels enhances model generalization and predictive performance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-15541-4)\n\n**Apple Explores Self\u2011Developed Multimodal AI Large Model Manzano: Combining Understanding and Generation Capabilities**\nApple is developing a new multimodal image model called Manzano, designed to combine image understanding and image generation. The model is still unpublished and has no demo, but a preprint paper\u2014written largely by Chinese researchers, including former Meta employee Pang Ruoming\u2014shows low\u2011resolution image samples with complex prompts. Apple claims that the dual\u2011function capability has long been a technical hurdle, causing most open\u2011source models to lag behind commercial systems such as OpenAI and Google.\n\nApple compared Manzano to DeepSeek Janus Pro and found it \"not weaker than OpenAI GPT\u20114o and Google\u2019s Gemini\u202f2.5 Flash Image Generation\" (original codename Nano Banana). The company notes that open\u2011source models usually specialize in either analysis or generation, whereas commercial systems handle both. Manzano addresses this by using a hybrid image tokenizer that outputs continuous tokens for understanding (floating\u2011point values) and discrete tokens for generation (fixed categories) from the same encoder, reducing task conflict.\n\nThe architecture consists of three parts: a hybrid tokenizer, a unified language model, and a separate image decoder. Apple built three decoder variants with 9\u202fbillion, 17.5\u202fbillion, and 35.2\u202fbillion parameters, supporting resolutions from 256\u202fpx to 2048\u202fpx.\n\nTraining involved three stages, using 2.3\u202fbillion image\u2011text pairs (public and internal) and 1\u202fbillion text\u2011image pairs, totaling 1.6\u202ftrillion tokens. Some data were synthetic, sourced from DALL\u2011E\u202f3 and ShareGPT\u20114o.\n\nIn internal tests, Manzano outperformed on ScienceQA, MM\u2011MU, and MathVista, especially on text\u2011heavy tasks like chart and document analysis. The 30\u202fbillion\u2011parameter version scored over 10 points higher than the smallest model on certain tasks. When compared to specialized systems, the performance gap was less than one point for the 30\u202fbillion\u2011parameter version. In image\u2011generation benchmarks, Manzano approached the top performers, handling complex instructions, style transfer, image overlay, and depth estimation.\n\nApple views Manzano as a strong alternative to existing models, with modular design allowing independent updates and the potential to advance multimodal AI.

It begins with the 2017 paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et\u202fal., which introduced the transformer architecture that replaced RNNs with self\u2011attention, enabling efficient long\u2011range context capture. The narrative then follows OpenAI\u2019s GPT series: GPT\u20111 (2018) introduced a two\u2011stage pre\u2011training/fine\u2011tuning pipeline; GPT\u20112 (2019) scaled to 1.5\u202fB parameters and demonstrated zero\u2011shot learning; GPT\u20113 (2020) reached 175\u202fB parameters and added instruction tuning via InstructGPT and RLHF. The 2020 paper on Scaling Laws formalized the relationship between model size, data, and compute, showing that larger models are more sample\u2011efficient.\n\nThe article discusses DeepMind\u2019s Chinchilla (2022), which proved that a 70\u202fB\u2011parameter model trained on more data outperforms larger models such as Gopher (280\u202fB) and Megatron (530\u202fB), recommending a 20:1 tokens\u2011to\u2011parameters ratio. Google\u2019s PaLM (540\u202fB parameters) leveraged the Pathways system for distributed training, while OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT (built on GPT\u20113.5) became the fastest\u2011growing consumer app, marking a shift from open research to commercial deployment.\n\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA series (7\u202fB\u201365\u202fB) introduced data\u2011efficient training and architectural tweaks like rotary embeddings and Grouped Query Attention (GQA). Anthropic\u2019s Claude 2 expanded the context window to 100\u202fK tokens, enhancing long\u2011form reasoning. Mixtral, a French MoE model, activated only 8\u202fB parameters during inference, reducing memory usage. Google\u2019s Gemini added multimodal reasoning, and GPT\u20114 (2023) brought multimodality, improved reasoning, and stronger RLHF alignment, powering ChatGPT Plus and enterprise solutions.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Sora (2024) pushed beyond text with a diffusion\u2011based text\u2011to\u2011video model capable of generating 60\u2011second videos. Meta\u2019s LLaMA\u202f3 (2024) matched GPT\u20114 performance, trained on ~4\u202ftrillion tokens. The 2025 DeepSeek\u2011r1 family emphasized step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning traces and RL\u2011based chain\u2011of\u2011thought alignment, achieving self\u2011correcting behavior. The author notes other notable models (Qwen, Kimi, Grok) and that Kimi has trained a 1\u202fT\u2011parameter model. The blog concludes with a casual sign\u2011off, reflecting its informal tone.\n\nKey metrics cited: 1.5\u202fB parameters (GPT\u20112), 175\u202fB (GPT\u20113), 70\u202fB (Chinchilla), 540\u202fB (PaLM), 100\u202fK\u2011token context (Claude\u202f2), 4\u202ftrillion tokens (LLaMA\u202f3). The narrative remains factual and explanatory, with no overt bias.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 01:48 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@axry/a-brief-history-of-generative-ai-e4fe02a37502)\n\n**Google unveils VaultGemma, a privacy-focused AI model to stop training data leaks**\nGoogle announced a new privacy\u2011focused language model called VaultGemma, a small language model (SLM) with one billion parameters that is described as the largest model ever trained with differential privacy (DP). According to the company\u2019s blog post on September\u202f12, VaultGemma was trained using a new set of scaling laws developed with DeepMind, allowing the model to be released with DP\u2011preserving noise added during pre\u2011training. The weights are available for free on Hugging Face and Kaggle. Google said, 'VaultGemma represents a significant step forward in the journey toward building AI that is both powerful and private by design. By developing and applying a new, robust understanding of the scaling laws for DP, we have successfully trained and released the largest open, DP\u2011trained language model to date.' The company noted that DP training introduces trade\u2011offs such as reduced training stability, larger batch sizes and higher compute costs, and that a key finding is that one should train a much smaller model with a much larger batch size than would be used without DP. In terms of performance, VaultGemma achieved scores comparable to an older, similarly sized GPT\u20112 model on benchmarks including HellaSwag, BoolQ, PIQA, SocialIQA, TriviaQA, ARC\u2011C and ARC\u2011E. To test privacy, Google prompted VaultGemma with partial text from a training document; the model did not return the exact text, but the company warned that 'if many training sequences contain information relevant to a particular fact, then in general VaultGemma will be able to provide that information.' The article also highlights that privacy experts have shown that personal data can be extracted from large language models by crafting specific prompts, citing the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes lawsuit against OpenAI where ChatGPT reproduced articles verbatim. Google stresses that more research is needed to close the utility gap between DP\u2011trained and non\u2011DP\u2011trained models.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 08:38 AM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/google-unveils-vaultgemma-privacy-focused-ai-model-training-data-10253028/)\n\n**ADSM: Boundaries of Model Capabilities**\nThe author explains their user\u2011level understanding of large language models (LLMs), outlining the core components: a weight matrix (trained parameters), a tokenizer, a decoder, and transformer layers that process input tokens and predict new ones step by step. They tested GPT, Gemini, Deepseek, and Grok and found that, for the same prompt, the models give very similar or even identical answers, which is expected because all modern LLMs share the transformer architecture. The article notes that LLMs are fundamentally text\u2011centric; when the author tried to attach an image to a Deepseek prompt, the model replied with the text \"\u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\". The author introduces ADSM (Agent\u2011Driven Software Management), which relies on text input and output.\n\nThe computational power of a neural network is determined by the number of neurons and the connections between them. One neuron can connect to thousands of others. Width refers to the dimensionality of the token\u2011embedding vector; depth is the number of transformer layers; connections are the weights linking neurons across layers. The author explains that doubling a layer roughly quadruples the number of weights, causing a rapid increase in computational cost. Each token requires a full pass through all layers, width, and connections, making generation resource\u2011intensive; optimisations such as sparse attention and selective \"experts\" reduce the number of active parameters at the cost of some accuracy.\n\nEvery model has a context window that can range from hundreds of thousands to a million tokens. The model\u2019s output is part of the same window as the input. The author discusses two strategies for result generation: one where the output occupies a larger share of the window, and another where it occupies a smaller share, the latter yielding more reproducible results. ADSM uses the second strategy, narrowing context to minimise the influence of randomness (\u0413\u0421\u0427). The author stresses that if a model\u2019s answer cannot be accepted, the prompt should be revised and a new dialogue started. The article concludes that human\u2011model interaction should follow a one\u2011question\u2011one\u2011answer principle to maintain focus.\n\nKey metrics and quotes: \"\u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\" (Deepseek response to an image), \"\u0417\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\" (distribution of knowledge in weights), \"\u0413\u0421\u0427\" (randomness generator), context window sizes from \"\u0441\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u044b\u0441\u044f\u0447 \u0442\u043e\u043a\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0434\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\", and the relationship that doubling a layer roughly quadruples the number of weights.\n\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/articles/945816/)\n\n**One Possible Future for AI in Science**\nThe article discusses how the scientific community is increasingly adopting AI, driven by the rapid rise of generative models such as ChatGPT and GPT\u20114. It notes that McKinsey estimates AI could generate $4\u202ftrillion annually, prompting enterprises to invest heavily. Scientists, through the Trillion Parameter Consortium (TPC) led by Argonne National Laboratory, aimed to develop large\u2011scale AI models for science, curate data, optimize exascale libraries, and create evaluation platforms. Early optimism was based on research that scaling language models improves performance on downstream tasks, as reported in the August\u202f2022 paper *Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models* by researchers from Google Brain, DeepMind, Stanford, and UNC. OpenAI\u2019s GPT\u20114, with an estimated 1.8\u202ftrillion parameters\u2014roughly ten times GPT\u20113\u2019s 175\u202fbillion\u2014illustrated the speed of scaling. However, the article highlights the \u201cscaling wall\u201d: limited training data, GPU bottlenecks, prohibitive costs, and hallucinations that prevent straightforward gains from larger models. Consequently, the near\u2011term prospect of an AGI capable of solving major scientific problems is now seen as unlikely. Instead, the focus has shifted to reasoning models that can automate routine scientific tasks. At TPC25, leaders outlined five initiatives to guide AI\u2019s role in science, emphasizing that while AI is not a silver bullet, it can accelerate existing workflows and potentially enable breakthroughs powered by human ingenuity.\n\nKey metrics and evidence:\n- AI\u2019s projected annual value: $4\u202ftrillion (McKinsey)\n- GPT\u20114 parameter count: ~1.8\u202ftrillion (OpenAI estimate)\n- GPT\u20113 parameter count: ~175\u202fbillion (OpenAI estimate)\n- Scaling wall factors: finite training data, GPU supply limits, high cost of 20\u2011trillion\u2011parameter models\n- TPC goals: AI models for science, data curation, exascale optimization, evaluation platforms\n- Quote from research: 'Scaling up language models has been shown to predictably improve performance and sample efficiency on a wide range of downstream tasks,' (Google Brain et al., 2022)\n- Quote from article: 'The idea that we were within a few years of building a super\u2011genius AI system capable of solving the world's toughest scientific problems appears to be over.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[HPCwire](https://www.hpcwire.com/2025/09/08/one-possible-future-for-ai-in-science/)\n\n**Open-Source LLMs: Divergent Paths to Similar Peaks**\nOpenAI\u2019s new open\u2011weights model, GPT\u2011OSS, was released as a 120\u202fbillion\u2011parameter and a 20\u202fbillion\u2011parameter autoregressive Mixture\u2011of\u2011Experts transformer.

Qwen3\u2019s pre\u2011training uses a 36\u2011trillion\u2011token dataset\u2014twice the size of Qwen2.5\u2014followed by a three\u2011stage regimen that ends with a long\u2011context stage where RoPE\u2019s base frequency is adjusted via ABF and YaRN is applied at inference to reach a 128,000\u2011token context.\n\nDeepSeek V3 is a 671\u202fbillion\u2011parameter MoE model, of which 37\u202fbillion parameters are active per token.  It emphasizes efficiency and capability, featuring a hybrid thinking mode and a Multi\u2011head Latent Attention (MLA) mechanism that compresses keys and values into a latent space for caching, then decompresses them during inference.  The V3.1 update adds a smarter tool\u2011calling feature.\n\nVisiting Partner Ankit Gupta notes that, despite these divergent architectures, the models converge on similar performance.  He says, \u2018This is quite surprising. You\u2019d expect that very different training methods would lead to very different results.\u2019  All three models employ YaRN for context extension\u2014GPT\u2011OSS from pre\u2011training, DeepSeek through fine\u2011tuning stages, and Qwen at inference\u2014illustrating how empirical experimentation drives progress.\n\nGupta also points out that the true competitive advantage lies in the opaque, labor\u2011intensive data engineering and post\u2011training pipelines.  He concludes, \u2018It\u2019s very difficult to replicate what they\u2019re releasing,\u2019 highlighting the barrier to replication despite the open\u2011source nature of the weights.\n\nKey metrics: GPT\u2011OSS 120\u202fB/20\u202fB parameters, 131,072\u2011token context; Qwen3 0.6\u202fB\u2013235\u202fB parameters, 36\u202ftrillion\u2011token pre\u2011training, 128,000\u2011token context; DeepSeek V3 671\u202fB total, 37\u202fB active per token.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 31, 2025 08:56 AM\nSource:[StartupHub.ai](https://www.startuphub.ai/ai-news/ai-video/2025/open-source-llms-divergent-paths-to-similar-peaks/)\n\n**Zhang Qingrui\u2019s View: Pandora\u2019s Box Opens? When AI Meets Quantum Technology \u2013 Commentary**\nZhang Qingrui\u2019s commentary traces the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) from Turing\u2019s 1950 question to the present, highlighting key milestones such as IBM Watson\u2019s 1997 chess win, AlphaGo\u2019s 2016 Go victory, and AlphaFold\u2019s protein\u2011folding breakthrough.  In 2023, ChatGPT\u2019s large\u2011language\u2011model (LLM) achieved over one hundred million users, and Elon Musk predicted that by 2026 a GenAI or AGI\u2011like system could produce literature surpassing Harry Potter and invent new technologies.  Mathematician Tsao Zhe\u2011xuan suggested using GenAI outputs as prompts to spark new mathematical ideas, echoing Socratic critical thinking.\n\nKevin Kelly, in *The World 5,000 Days Later*, forecasts that more than 80\u202f% of future influential intelligences will be AI, and that humans will coexist with AI\u2011assisted brain intelligence (AIaBI), ushering a post\u2011Anthropocene era.\n\nThe article explains that training LLMs requires massive data and compute: ChatGPT\u2019s training set is ~45\u202fTB, with >1.75\u202ftrillion parameters, demanding at least 10\u202f000 Nvidia A100 GPUs; GPT\u20114 used ~25\u202f000 A100 GPUs, and GPT\u20115 will need ~50\u202f000 H100 GPUs.  A single H100 costs $25\u202f000\u2013$30\u202f000, and its monthly energy use is ~500\u202fkWh\u2014roughly the average Taiwan household\u2019s off\u2011peak consumption.  Nvidia\u2019s 2020 A100 peaked at 400\u202fW, while an H100 can consume ~500\u202fkWh/month.

It cites a 2020 OpenAI study by Kaplan and colleagues that identified a rule of thumb: each parameter should be trained on about 6 tokens of data. This guideline was widely adopted, leading to models such as GPT\u20113 with 175\u202fbillion parameters trained on roughly 300\u202fbillion tokens. In 2022, DeepMind\u2019s Chinchilla experiment, which evaluated 400 models, found that the optimal ratio was closer to 20 tokens per parameter, not 6. This shift meant that a 70\u202fbillion\u2011parameter Chinchilla model, trained on a larger data set, outperformed a 280\u202fbillion\u2011parameter Gopher model under the same compute budget. The article uses the analogy of students needing 20 pages of reading material instead of 6 to illustrate the importance of data quantity. It concludes that scaling laws serve as a compass for AI research, emphasizing that efficiency and data quality matter more than sheer size, and that recent models such as Meta\u2019s LLaMA and Mistral follow this balanced approach. Evidence: the article quotes Kaplan\u2019s rule of 6 tokens per parameter, DeepMind\u2019s 20\u2011token finding, the 400\u2011model experiment, and the comparison between Chinchilla (70\u202fbillion parameters) and Gopher (280\u202fbillion parameters).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 08:47 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@jain.sm/scaling-laws-in-ai-why-bigger-models-arent-always-smarter-bcfeac4ba8de)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse panel of experts\u2014including AI infrastructure engineers, machine learning operations specialists, semiconductor and distributed systems analysts, economics and cost-benefit experts, and computer scientists specializing in scaling laws\u2014the consensus is overwhelmingly that a dense machine learning model with at least 100 trillion parameters will not be trained before 2026. All experts point out that no credible evidence exists for the training or imminent release of such a model; the largest confirmed dense models remain an order or two of magnitude smaller, and all trillion-plus parameter models to date employ sparse (Mixture-of-Experts, MoE) architectures instead of being dense as required by the question's criteria. \n\nKey factors cited include overwhelming hardware, infrastructure, energy, and financial barriers; the immense scale of compute and memory needed for dense 100T models; and the strict timeline (only one month remaining). All recent industry and research trends have shifted decisively toward efficient, sparse, or hybrid architectures for scaling, as motivated by both algorithmic breakthroughs (e.g., Chinchilla scaling laws demonstrating diminishing returns for parameter count) and cost/energy considerations. There is unanimous expert consensus\u2014bolstered by the lack of credible leaks, public claims, or even rumors\u2014that a dense 100T model is very unlikely to be trained and publicly documented in time, with sparse models dominating recent large-scale efforts. \n\nSome experts note a small nonzero chance for a surprise last-minute announcement from a government or major tech lab, potentially for reasons of prestige or technical demonstration. However, the absence of supply chain signals, leaks, or news reports, combined with the industry\u2019s current priorities, makes this scenario extremely improbable.\n\nExpert final probability estimates for a dense 100T model being trained before 2026 range from 1% to 2%, with base rates and historical precedent cited as essentially zero. The consensus expects the question to resolve as 'No.'",
