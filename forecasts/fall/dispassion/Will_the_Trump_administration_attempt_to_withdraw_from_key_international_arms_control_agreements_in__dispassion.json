Furthermore, there is significant institutional resistance to withdrawing from the most foundational treaties (NPT, CWC, BWC), which would deter even a norm-breaking administration from making such a move on short notice. While there is always a non-trivial risk of a last-minute shock given Trump\u2019s unpredictability, the strong status quo bias, lack of concrete action, and recent conciliatory rhetoric toward arms control lower the probability considerably.

While the timeline is compressed, the resolution criteria are triggered by any one of seven treaties, some of which (e.g., New START) are already under stress and subject to great power bargaining dynamics. Realists would argue that if Trump perceived a material advantage in signaling resolve or breaking with arms control as leverage against Russia or China\u2014even for domestic political gain\u2014a symbolic formal step could be initiated swiftly, especially if a foreign policy crisis or shock occurs before the deadline. Thus, while the odds remain low, a probability in the low double digits (10\u201315%) may better capture the tail risk inherent in the current situation, particularly given the volatility of both international politics and the Trump administration\u2019s decision-making style."

From a neoliberal institutionalist perspective, I concur that the absence of any credible reporting on formal withdrawal steps\u2014such as notifications, executive orders, or defunding\u2014means the probability of a qualifying attempt is low, even with Trump\u2019s history of abrupt moves. You also emphasize, correctly, the importance of bureaucratic and Congressional resistance, especially regarding deeply institutionalized treaties. By anchoring your forecast not just in Trump's past record, but also in the current, process-driven reality and the strict resolution criteria, your 8% figure is well-justified. The scenario risk is acknowledged but not over-weighted, and your reasoning is appropriately status quo\u2013anchored.

Your base rate approach is also appropriate: most major US arms control withdrawals have been previewed well in advance, and the very short window before the Metaculus deadline makes sudden, procedurally valid withdrawal highly unlikely. I would reinforce your argument that, despite Trump\u2019s history, the absence of any formal moves and the logistical hurdles of a qualifying withdrawal leave the risk low but non-zero. The stress you place on the fine print and historical precedent provides a compelling reason for a forecast in the 10% range. This is a strong, legally grounded, and status quo\u2013anchored forecast."

However, Rational Choice Theory would emphasize that even highly transactional or unpredictable leaders are still constrained by the high costs (domestically and internationally) of formal withdrawal from foundational treaties, especially on a rapid timeline. The news corpus shows no sign of crisis escalation or groundwork for abrogation; instead, it features repeated positive signals toward extending New START. While the risk of a symbolic, last-minute move cannot be dismissed, the probability of such an action resulting in a full, qualifying attempt within two and a half months remains low in the absence of both preparatory action and acute crisis. Thus, a low single-digit to high single-digit probability (rather than low double digits) better reflects the current cost-benefit landscape and the strong status quo bias that typically prevails, even for unpredictable leaders."

You correctly highlight that the treaties most vulnerable to withdrawal have already been exited, and that the remaining agreements (particularly NPT, CWC, and BWC) are deeply embedded in both US law and international norms, requiring a complex, time-consuming process for withdrawal. This procedural inertia, especially given the short timeline to the resolution date and the absence of any public or bureaucratic signals of imminent action, is a powerful bulwark against a qualifying attempt. You also appropriately weigh the distinction between Trump\u2019s rhetorical volatility and the actual prerequisites for a formal exit. From an executive decision-making stance, I would reinforce your conclusion that, absent a dramatic and currently unforeseeable shock, the likelihood of Trump overcoming both legal and institutional hurdles in the next 2.5 months is extremely low.

Your attention to the compressed timeline and the absence of observable preparatory steps is crucial: even a norm-defying administration faces immense hurdles to executing a qualifying withdrawal attempt in under three months.

By relating regime theory to both the high domestic/international costs of abrogation and the compressed timeline, your forecast captures the inertia that often characterizes arms control policy. I would further support your emphasis on the need for an unambiguous executive shift\u2014absent from current developments\u2014and your recognition that the most plausible risk comes from unforeseen crisis, rather than planned policy.

While the news cycle is status quo-oriented and institutional inertia is strong, deterrence theory cautions that perceived adversary provocations or a desire to demonstrate resolve can\u2014on occasion\u2014prompt rapid, symbolic actions, even if only for signaling purposes. Given that the resolution criteria require only a formal attempt on any one of seven treaties (not necessarily the most entrenched), and that New START remains fragile amid heightened U.S.\u2013Russia tensions, a higher single-digit to low double-digit probability (e.g., 10\u201315%) more accurately captures the tail risk of a sudden, crisis- or leverage-driven move.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s first term saw a pattern of withdrawing from international arms control agreements, including:\n\n* **INF Treaty (**[**2019**](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/article/article/1924779/us-withdraws-from-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty/)**)** \u2013 U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.\n* **Open Skies Treaty (**[**2020**](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-12/news/us-completes-open-skies-treaty-withdrawal)**)** \u2013 Trump announced withdrawal, citing Russian non-compliance.\n* **Iran Nuclear Deal (**[**2018**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html)**)** \u2013 The U.S. exited the JCPOA, leading to renewed tensions.\n\nWith Trump's return to office in 2025, there is renewed concern that his administration may withdraw from key arms control agreements, particularly those seen as restricting U.S. military capabilities. The agreements most at risk include:\n\n1. [**New START**](https://www.state.gov/new-start-treaty) **(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty)**, the last remaining U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control treaty, limiting strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov stated, 'We welcome this statement and believe it already provides grounds for optimism that the United States supports this initiative from Putin.' Putin, who had proposed the extension on September 22, emphasized that it would only be viable if the U.S. acted in a similar manner and did not take actions undermining the current strategic deterrent balance.

The New START Treaty, signed in 2010 by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev and extended in 2021 by Putin and President Joe Biden, expires on February 5, 2026. Strategic nuclear weapons are long-range systems designed to impact the outcome of war by targeting centers of power, command structures, or critical infrastructure. Russia and the U.S. together possess about 87% of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads\u20145,459 and 5,177 respectively, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). Arms control treaties originated after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis to reduce the risk of miscommunication and slow the arms race. However, with rising tensions over Ukraine and both nations modernizing arsenals, most treaties have collapsed, with each side blaming the other. Key issues include: U.S. plans for the $175-billion Golden Dome space-based missile defense system, which Russia views as destabilizing; mutual accusations over new weapons systems\u2014Russia\u2019s Oreshnik, Kinzhal, and Avangard, and U.S. strategic capabilities; divergent views on tactical nuclear weapons, with Russia holding 1,477 non-strategic warheads and the U.S. 200; U.S. superiority in strategic nuclear submarines; and the inclusion of China, which has about 600 warheads and is not willing to negotiate with nations with larger arsenals. Putin warned that Russia would conduct a nuclear test if another power does, citing intelligence of preparations by an unnamed country. The future of the one-year extension remains uncertain, as Putin stated further voluntary limits depend on U.S. actions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:25 AM\nSource:[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/could-us-russia-extend-last-nuclear-weapons-treaty-2025-10-06/)\n\n**Trump suggests willing to extend arms control deal with Russia | News Flash**\nUS President Donald Trump stated on October 6, 2025, that he is open to extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia, following a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a one-year extension.

The offer, made by Putin in September 2025, calls for both the U.S. and Russia to uphold the existing limits without formally renewing the treaty, contingent on mutual agreement. The proposal comes amid heightened tensions, including reports of Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace and continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Russia\u2019s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, emphasized Moscow\u2019s expectation for a formal response from Washington, stressing the importance of reducing global nuclear risks. While both nations are exploring arms control measures, no verifiable or binding agreement has been reached.

The INF Treaty, signed in 1987 between Reagan and Gorbatschow, banned land-based nuclear missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. The treaty effectively ended in 2019 after the United States withdrew, and now Russia has formally ended its own adherence. This move signals Russia's intent to resume development and deployment of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. In response, the U.S. plans to station new nuclear-capable systems in Germany, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, SM-6 interceptors, and hypersonic weapons\u2014systems with greater range than previously deployed. Russia has already deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, capable of reaching German cities. The situation has prompted concerns across Europe, particularly in Germany, as the continent risks becoming a potential theater for nuclear conflict. Experts warn that the collapse of the INF Treaty marks the end of an era of mutual restraint, and the prospects for new arms control agreements appear increasingly uncertain. The article notes that the timing coincides with heightened U.S.-Russia tensions, including alleged provocations from Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, though no direct causal link is established.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[news.de](https://www.news.de/politik/858836666/wladimir-putin-russland-ruestet-sich-weiter-heftig-auf-deutschland-koennte-bald-zur-zielscheibe-werden/1/)\n\n**Cold War Echoes**\nOn September 22, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral proposal to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) for one year, until February 2026. The treaty, signed by Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev in 2010, limits U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 launchers, with rigorous verification mechanisms. Russia has consistently adhered to the treaty, allowing U.S. inspections and data exchanges. In contrast, the U.S. has withdrawn from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (2002), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and the Open Skies Treaty, weakening global arms control. The article argues that Western media has largely ignored Putin\u2019s proposal, possibly due to a narrative that portrays Russia as reckless. The author contends that Putin\u2019s move is not altruistic but a strategic calculation: Russia, having modernized over 90% of its nuclear triad, seeks to project responsibility and shift blame to Washington if the U.S. refuses. The U.S. response has been insufficient, and strained relations post-Ukraine negotiations have stalled talks. There is growing pressure to include China in future agreements, but China has rejected participation in a U.S.-Russia framework. The author warns that demanding a multilateral treaty as a precondition risks collapsing the existing bilateral treaty, removing the last enforceable limits on nuclear arsenals. The article cautions that Europe\u2019s misinterpretation of Russia\u2019s gesture as weakness is dangerous, as Russia is not vulnerable but confident in its deterrent. Without New START, verification, data sharing, and notifications would cease, increasing the risk of miscalculation, accidents, and an unregulated arms race. The collapse of the INF Treaty already reduced reaction times to minutes, heightening danger. The author emphasizes that even a one-year extension provides critical time for diplomacy and maintains predictability, which is better than chaos. The decision to accept or reject the extension will determine global security for decades. The treaty expires in February 2026, and delay risks a future without rules, limits, or trust. The writer, M A Hossain, a political and defense analyst based in Bangladesh, concludes that September 2025 may be remembered as a missed opportunity if leadership remains in stalemate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 02:56 AM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.nation.com.pk/01-Oct-2025/cold-war-echoes)\n\n**Putin Attempts to Pressure Trump Administration: ISW Explains the Rationale Behind Nuclear Weapon Statements**\nOn 22 September 2025, Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would continue to observe the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START\u2011III) for an additional year beyond its scheduled expiration in February 2026, while simultaneously threatening the Trump administration to '\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u0433\u0438'.

The ISW notes that Russia has repeatedly violated international agreements since 2000, including the Open\u2011Skies Treaty, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty, the Intermediate\u2011Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and the Chemical Weapons Convention, and that it continues to use prohibited chemical weapons in Ukraine and against European opponents. The article also highlights that the Russian defence industry faces internal challenges\u2014economic sanctions, supply\u2011chain bottlenecks, and a shortage of skilled personnel\u2014yet prioritises funding for drones and missile production, while tank and aviation factories operate at capacity and focus on maintenance and upgrades.

Kimball said this would provide an \"acceptable level of predictability and restraint\" and called it a \"positive step\".

The statement was framed in the context of Moscow\u2011Washington relations. Newsweek titled the story \u2018\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u044f\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0438\u2019. The Washington Post noted that the impending expiry of the treaty amid a pause in dialogue heightened concerns among arms\u2011control advocates. The Independent said that maintaining limits would ease pressure on the U.S. and Russia in negotiations about \u2018what to do next\u2019. The New\u202fYork\u202fTimes argued that Moscow seeks to separate Ukraine\u2011related measures from arms\u2011control and economic talks, a stance the U.S. rejects. G1 highlighted attempts to restore bilateral ties, citing a meeting between Putin and former U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska in August, but warned it is a laborious process fraught with tension. India Today reported that Trump is interested in a new arms\u2011control agreement that would include China, and the Washington Post added that \u2018He (Trump \u2013 \u0440\u0435\u0434.), \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0434 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u2019. The former White House administration had indicated that President Trump had the capacity to negotiate a START extension. Putin had previously announced on 21 February 2023 that Russia was suspending participation in the START treaty, stressing that the country was not withdrawing from the agreement. He said that before resuming talks, Russia needed to understand what France and the United Kingdom were demanding and how to account for their NATO strike capabilities. The official notice of suspension was sent to the U.S. on 28 February. In early June 2023, Washington responded by halting the transmission of information about the status and location of its strategic weapons under the treaty, revoking inspection visas for Russian specialists, and refusing to issue new ones. It also stopped providing telemetry data on U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines. At the end of December 2024, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reminded that Russia still adhered to quantitative limits on strategic weapons under the treaty despite its suspension, and that until the U.S. abandons its anti\u2011Russian stance, \u2018we will not engage in negotiations with them on arms control\u2019.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 05:14 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250922/rossiya-2043611033.html)\n\n**Putin warns global nuclear arms control system has been destroyed, offers one-year extension of pact with US**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned that the global nuclear arms\u2011control system has been destroyed and offered to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States for one year if Washington commits to the same. The treaty, signed in 2010, limits each side to no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 missiles or bombers and includes on\u2011site inspections. It is due to expire on February\u00a05\u00a02026. Speaking at a Security Council meeting, Putin said the extension would be in the interests of global non\u2011proliferation and could facilitate dialogue on a successor agreement. He added that Russia would be prepared to continue adhering to the treaty\u2019s central numerical limits for one year beyond its expiration, stating, 'Based on an analysis of the situation, we will make a decision on whether to maintain these voluntary self\u2011imposed restrictions,' and that the extension would only be viable if the United States did not take steps that undermined the existing balance of deterrence. The treaty has faced challenges: on\u2011site inspections have not taken place since 2020, and in February\u00a02023 Putin announced a suspension of Russia\u2019s participation, arguing that allowing U.S. inspectors access to Russian facilities was unacceptable while Washington and its NATO allies pursued Moscow\u2019s defeat in Ukraine. Despite the suspension, the Kremlin maintained that Russia would continue observing the limits on nuclear arsenals. With over four months to the accord\u2019s expiry, no talks on renewal or replacement have begun, and differences over the war in Ukraine remain a key obstacle. Trump has previously expressed interest in negotiating a new agreement that would include China, but no formal discussions have started. Putin said the current situation in global security was deteriorating, citing new risks and the collapse of the arms\u2011control system, and reiterated that Russia is not seeking an arms race but is willing to extend New START for one year if the United States reciprocates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/putin-warns-global-nuclear-arms-control-system-has-been-destroyed-offers-one-year-extension-of-pact-with-us/cid/2124451)\n\n**Putin offers one-year extension of last US-Russia nuclear arms treaty**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced on Monday that he is willing to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New\u202fStart) with the United States for one year, contingent on a reciprocal extension by President Donald\u202fTrump. The New\u202fStart treaty, signed in 2010, is the last remaining arms\u2011control agreement between the two nuclear powers and limits the number of deployed strategic warheads and the delivery systems that can carry them. It is set to expire on 5\u202fFebruary\u202f2026. In a speech to Russia\u2019s Security Council, Putin said, 'Russia is prepared to continue adhering to the central numerical limits under the New\u202fStart Treaty for one year after 5\u202fFebruary\u202f2026.' He added, 'Subsequently, based on an analysis of the situation, we will make a decision on whether to maintain these voluntary self\u2011imposed restrictions. We believe that this measure will only be viable if the United States acts in a similar manner and does not take steps that undermine or violate the existing balance of deterrence capabilities.' The proposal aims to preserve global non\u2011proliferation interests and open the door for future talks on a successor agreement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/russias-putin-offers-one-year-extension-of-nuclear-arms-treaty-with-us-if-trump-does-the-same-2791499-2025-09-22)\n\n**Global risk rises as Russia walks away from nuclear pact - Asia Times**\nRussia has announced its withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed in 1987, citing changes to its nuclear doctrine that make it easier to use nuclear weapons. This decision has raised concerns about the future of nuclear deterrence and the danger of global nuclear proliferation. The move comes after a spat between US President Donald Trump and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and just days before the deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine. The INF treaty was a key agreement between the US and Soviet Union to reduce the number of ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles. Russia's decision to withdraw from the treaty only concerns ground-based missile systems, but the future of the New Start treaty, which limits the number of deployed strategic missiles, warheads and launchers, is also in doubt. The US and Russia are the most heavily armed nuclear powers, with an estimated 5,580 and 5,225 warheads respectively. The true power of nuclear weapons lies not in their destructive capacity, but in their ability to be used to maneuver and protect political power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2025/08/global-risk-rises-as-russia-walks-away-from-nuclear-pact/)\n\n**Trump wants new nuclear talks with Russia**\nUS President Donald Trump has expressed interest in resuming negotiations with Russia to maintain existing restrictions on nuclear weapons. The New START treaty, which limits warheads and their delivery means, is set to expire on February 5, 2026. Trump stated, 'That's not an agreement you want expiring. We're starting to work on that.' He emphasized the importance of dialogue between Russia and the US on arms control, particularly concerning strategic stability, saying, 'When you take off nuclear restrictions, that's a big problem.' Trump also highlighted the need for 'an appropriate level of trust' between the two nations. This comes after relations between the US and Russia deteriorated over allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and the conflict in Ukraine. Trump's administration previously withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty, leading to Moscow accusing Washington of dismantling the global arms control system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 11:12 PM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/622011-trump-russia-nuclear-talks/)\n\n**Trump wants new nuclear talks with Russia  --  RT World News**\nUS President Donald Trump has expressed interest in resuming negotiations with Russia to maintain restrictions on nuclear weapons.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014including US Foreign Policy Analysis, Arms Control Negotiation, International Relations theories (Realism, Neoliberal Institutionalism, Regime Theory), Political Science approaches, and Security Studies\u2014there is strong consensus that the probability of the Trump administration attempting a formal withdrawal from key international arms control agreements before January 1, 2026, is low but not zero. Experts consistently cite several converging reasons: (1) While Trump's prior administration set a precedent for withdrawing from arms control agreements (INF, Open Skies, JCPOA), the remaining major treaties (especially New START, NPT, CWC, BWC, OST) are far more deeply entrenched, with strong bipartisan and bureaucratic support and significant domestic/international costs to withdrawal. (2) Recent public statements by Trump indicate openness to extending New START and favor engagement, not imminent withdrawal. (3) The time window until the resolution date is very narrow (about 2.5 months), leaving little practical opportunity for the complex legal and bureaucratic process involved, with no current evidence of active withdrawal preparations. (4) The strict resolution criteria exclude mere rhetoric, reviews, or negotiations\u2014only concrete legal or funding actions qualify. While the experts note nonzero risk, due to the Trump administration's historical unpredictability and the possibility of a crisis or sudden reversal, all emphasize the inertia of the status quo, the absence of concrete preparatory signals, and the importance of institutional/bureaucratic constraints at this late date. Probability estimates from the different perspectives cluster between 5% and 15%, with most in the single digits or low teens, reflecting strong status quo bias. The consensus scenario is that the administration may allow New START to expire or negotiate adjustments, but will not take the formal steps required for the question to resolve Yes before the deadline.",
