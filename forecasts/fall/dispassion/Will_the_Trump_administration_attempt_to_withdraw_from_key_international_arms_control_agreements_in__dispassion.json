While treaty law practice rightly highlights the legal and bureaucratic hurdles to formal withdrawal, the modern presidential doctrine\u2014especially under Trump\u2014shows that the executive branch can, when motivated, circumvent or rapidly accelerate such procedures (as seen with the Open Skies and INF withdrawals). Moreover, your scenario analysis could more explicitly address the possibility of a 'suspension of compliance' with New START as a fast-track way to fulfill the resolution criteria, which is within the president's unilateral power and does not require the same formal withdrawal process. This would slightly increase the probability, but I still think your risk estimate is a bit high given the current administration's conciliatory signals and the severe political costs of a sudden move in this compressed timeframe.

The NSC process, even under a president with a history of rapid action, requires interagency deliberation for such a consequential step, and at this late stage (with public messaging focused on possible extension) it is highly unlikely that a new withdrawal push could clear procedural, legal, and political obstacles before the resolution window closes. Additionally, your scenario does not sufficiently account for the dampening effect of current high-level rhetoric supporting extension and the fact that New START's natural expiration offers a less politically costly off-ramp.

As an arms control negotiation specialist, I agree with your emphasis on the proximity to New START's expiration\u2014which makes passive expiration far more likely than a preemptive withdrawal\u2014and on the extremely high political and diplomatic costs of exiting multilateral treaties like the NPT or CWC. You also correctly identify the absence of credible reporting of withdrawal moves and the fact that the Trump administration is, at present, signaling negotiation rather than rupture. Your scenario analysis is realistic: the most plausible path to a Yes would involve a sudden, formal suspension of compliance with New START, but all available evidence points in the opposite direction. Your probabilistic estimate (10%) is well-justified, balancing Trump\u2019s unpredictability with the overwhelming inertia of the status quo and the lack of procedural groundwork for withdrawal. In sum, your reasoning aligns with both base rates and the institutional logic that governs high-stakes arms control decisions."

You correctly note that, even under a historically skeptical administration, the political, diplomatic, and procedural obstacles to withdrawal are immense. Furthermore, your point about the short time window and lack of preparatory moves is well-calibrated: any abrupt action now would incur outsized reputational and alliance costs for little strategic gain, especially when the default (letting New START expire) is an easier path. While acknowledging Trump\u2019s unpredictability, you avoid overreacting to it, and your probability (8%) is a reasonable reflection of the current signals and institutional context.

You also correctly recognize that letting New START expire is a less costly option than a formal withdrawal, which fits both the rational actor model and the realist view that states generally avoid high-cost moves absent overriding interests or acute crises. Your final probability (10%) is congruent with the observable facts and the incentives at play: it reflects residual risk from Trump\u2019s unpredictability, but avoids over-weighting it given the lack of concrete moves.

You correctly identify that regime persistence is favored absent a major exogenous shock, and your analysis of the distinction between rhetorical posturing and the concrete steps required for withdrawal is precise and well-supported by both the resolution criteria and recent news. The only plausible Yes scenario would require a dramatic and abrupt shift, for which there is no current evidence. Your probability (12%) is slightly higher than mine, but your logic for assigning a non-zero risk is sound, reflecting the unpredictable nature of executive action under Trump.

Your discussion of the difference between rhetorical posturing and the high bar set by the resolution criteria is essential, as is your recognition that the only plausible risk is with New START, but even there, current diplomatic overtures preclude a Yes outcome. The probability you assign (8%) is well-justified: it accounts for residual risk from executive unpredictability, but does not overweight it given the institutional, legal, and diplomatic barriers.

The point that the specificity of the resolution criteria (excluding rhetoric and exploratory reviews) sets a high bar is crucial and often overlooked.

You correctly frame the extremely compressed timeline as a major obstacle, and your attention to the legal and bureaucratic steps required is well-placed. Importantly, you recognize that Trump's pattern of skepticism is a secondary risk factor, outweighed by the administration's current public openness to extension and the bipartisan/international support for key treaties. Your scenario analysis is precise\u2014highlighting that only a sudden, formal move on New START could plausibly tip the balance, which is unsupported by current signals.

In the current scenario, Trump\u2019s explicit public support for an extension, coupled with the absence of any bureaucratic movement or leaks about impending withdrawal, is a powerful signal to both domestic and international audiences, further reducing the practical likelihood of a formal withdrawal attempt. Moreover, you could more directly address how the administration\u2019s signaling serves as a commitment device that raises the political costs of any abrupt reversal.

The original question opened on 2025-03-18 15:33:28 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/36025). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s first term saw a pattern of withdrawing from international arms control agreements, including:\n\n* **INF Treaty (**[**2019**](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/article/article/1924779/us-withdraws-from-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty/)**)** \u2013 U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.\n* **Open Skies Treaty (**[**2020**](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-12/news/us-completes-open-skies-treaty-withdrawal)**)** \u2013 Trump announced withdrawal, citing Russian non-compliance.\n* **Iran Nuclear Deal (**[**2018**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html)**)** \u2013 The U.S. exited the JCPOA, leading to renewed tensions.\n\nWith Trump's return to office in 2025, there is renewed concern that his administration may withdraw from key arms control agreements, particularly those seen as restricting U.S. military capabilities. The agreements most at risk include:\n\n1. [**New START**](https://www.state.gov/new-start-treaty) **(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty)**, the last remaining U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control treaty, limiting strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems. It is set to expire in 2026, but there are concerns that Trump may refuse renewal or suspend compliance before then.\n2. [**The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)**](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention), a global ban on chemical weapons with strong bipartisan support, but potential friction due to compliance disputes with China and Russia.\n3. [**The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**](https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/nuclear/npt/), the cornerstone of global nuclear non-proliferation. While withdrawal is unlikely, Trump has expressed skepticism toward arms control constraints in the past.\n4. [**The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)**](https://www.ctbto.org/our-mission/the-treaty), though never ratified by the U.S., Trump officials previously floated the idea of resuming nuclear testing\u2014potentially violating the spirit of the treaty.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36025,\"question_id\":35459}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2026, credible sources report that the Trump administration has formally attempted to withdraw from or significantly reduce U.S. participation in at least one of the following seven international arms control agreements:\n\n* New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty)\n* The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)\n* The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\n* The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)\n* Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)\n* Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)\n* Outer Space Treaty (OST)\n\nA formal attempt to withdraw includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:\n\n1. Official notification of withdrawal: The U.S. government formally notifies treaty partners, the United Nations, or other relevant bodies of its intent to exit an arms control agreement.\n2. Legally binding action: The administration takes executive action, submits a withdrawal request to Congress (where required), or engages in legal or procedural steps toward exiting an agreement.\n3. Suspension of compliance: The administration officially announces that it will no longer comply with the obligations of an agreement, effectively nullifying U.S. participation.\n4. Substantive defunding: The administration or Congress enacts a significant funding cut (at least 50%) to an agreement\u2019s implementation, undermining U.S. participation.\n\nIf no formal attempt to withdraw from any of the seven treaties is made by January 1, 2026, the question will resolve as **No**.",
        "fine_print": "The question will *not* resolve as **Yes** based solely on:\n\n* Rhetorical statements: If Trump or senior officials publicly criticize an agreement but do not take concrete steps to exit.\n* Exploratory reviews: If the administration commissions a study or internal review on withdrawing but does not take formal action.\n* Negotiated revisions: If the administration renegotiates an agreement but does not seek withdrawal.\n\n***\n\n* CTBT was never ratified by the US. Despite that, this question could still resolve based the US announcing a policy of non-compliance, as stated in criterion #3.\n* New START is set to expire in February 2026. A non-extension would not resolve this question as **Yes**. The US would have to either withdraw before February 2026 or extend the treaty and withdraw afterwards.\n\nIf there is ambiguity regarding whether an attempt meets the criteria, expert assessments from organizations such as the [Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/), [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/), or [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/) will be considered by Metaculus to resolve this question.",

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov stated, 'We welcome this statement and believe it already provides grounds for optimism that the United States supports this initiative from Putin.' Putin, who had proposed the extension on September 22, emphasized that it would only be viable if the U.S. acted in a similar manner and did not take actions undermining the current strategic deterrent balance. He labeled a potential U.S. withdrawal from the treaty\u2014signed in April 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev\u2014as 'erroneous' and 'short-sighted' from 'many perspectives.' Trump responded to reporters at the White House the previous day by calling Putin\u2019s proposal a 'good idea.' Russia suspended the treaty\u2019s implementation, though not formally denounced it, on February 21, 2023, which has since prevented Western specialists from inspecting Russian nuclear facilities. START III limits each side to a maximum of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 strategic delivery systems across land, sea, and air. In mid-September, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Riabkov acknowledged that negotiations to normalize U.S.-Russia relations were stalled.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:27 AM\nSource:[El Arague\u00f1o](https://elaragueno.com.ve/rusia-saluda-reaccion-de-trump-a-propuesta-de-putin-sobre-tratado-de-desarme-nuclear/)\n\n**Explainer: Could US and Russia extend last nuclear weapons treaty?**\nOn October 6, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump responded positively to Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to voluntarily extend the New START Treaty limits on deployed strategic nuclear weapons for one year, following Putin's September offer. The New START Treaty, signed in 2010 by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev and extended in 2021 by Putin and President Joe Biden, expires on February 5, 2026. Strategic nuclear weapons are long-range systems designed to impact the outcome of war by targeting centers of power, command structures, or critical infrastructure. Russia and the U.S. together possess about 87% of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads\u20145,459 and 5,177 respectively, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). Arms control treaties originated after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis to reduce the risk of miscommunication and slow the arms race. However, with rising tensions over Ukraine and both nations modernizing arsenals, most treaties have collapsed, with each side blaming the other. Key issues include: U.S. plans for the $175-billion Golden Dome space-based missile defense system, which Russia views as destabilizing; mutual accusations over new weapons systems\u2014Russia\u2019s Oreshnik, Kinzhal, and Avangard, and U.S. strategic capabilities; divergent views on tactical nuclear weapons, with Russia holding 1,477 non-strategic warheads and the U.S. 200; U.S. superiority in strategic nuclear submarines; and the inclusion of China, which has about 600 warheads and is not willing to negotiate with nations with larger arsenals. Putin warned that Russia would conduct a nuclear test if another power does, citing intelligence of preparations by an unnamed country. The future of the one-year extension remains uncertain, as Putin stated further voluntary limits depend on U.S. actions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:25 AM\nSource:[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/could-us-russia-extend-last-nuclear-weapons-treaty-2025-10-06/)\n\n**Trump suggests willing to extend arms control deal with Russia | News Flash**\nUS President Donald Trump stated on October 6, 2025, that he is open to extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia, following a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a one-year extension.

The offer, made by Putin in September 2025, calls for both the U.S. and Russia to uphold the existing limits without formally renewing the treaty, contingent on mutual agreement. The proposal comes amid heightened tensions, including reports of Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace and continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine. On October 5, 2025, Trump stated the idea 'seems like a good idea' during a press briefing outside the White House, signaling openness without committing to a formal agreement. Russia\u2019s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, emphasized Moscow\u2019s expectation for a formal response from Washington, stressing the importance of reducing global nuclear risks. While both nations are exploring arms control measures, no verifiable or binding agreement has been reached. The international community continues to monitor developments closely, as New START has served as a cornerstone of nuclear stability for over a decade. Washington remains in the process of evaluating the proposal, with ongoing tensions in Ukraine and defense cooperation with allies likely to influence its final decision.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 10:28 PM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2025/10/05/trump-considera-buena-idea-la-oferta-de-putin-para-mantener-limites-nucleares-estrategicos-tras-el-fin-del-tratado-new-start-en-medio-de-tensiones-por-ucrania-y-misiles-de-largo-alcance/)\n\n**Trump Suggests Willing To Extend Arms Control Deal With Russia**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump stated on October 5, 2025, that he would be willing to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia, following a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a one-year extension.

The INF Treaty, signed in 1987 between Reagan and Gorbatschow, banned land-based nuclear missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. The treaty effectively ended in 2019 after the United States withdrew, and now Russia has formally ended its own adherence. This move signals Russia's intent to resume development and deployment of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. In response, the U.S. plans to station new nuclear-capable systems in Germany, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, SM-6 interceptors, and hypersonic weapons\u2014systems with greater range than previously deployed. Russia has already deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, capable of reaching German cities. The situation has prompted concerns across Europe, particularly in Germany, as the continent risks becoming a potential theater for nuclear conflict. Experts warn that the collapse of the INF Treaty marks the end of an era of mutual restraint, and the prospects for new arms control agreements appear increasingly uncertain. The article notes that the timing coincides with heightened U.S.-Russia tensions, including alleged provocations from Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, though no direct causal link is established.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[news.de](https://www.news.de/politik/858836666/wladimir-putin-russland-ruestet-sich-weiter-heftig-auf-deutschland-koennte-bald-zur-zielscheibe-werden/1/)\n\n**Cold War Echoes**\nOn September 22, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral proposal to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) for one year, until February 2026. The treaty, signed by Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev in 2010, limits U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 launchers, with rigorous verification mechanisms. Russia has consistently adhered to the treaty, allowing U.S. inspections and data exchanges. In contrast, the U.S. has withdrawn from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (2002), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and the Open Skies Treaty, weakening global arms control. The article argues that Western media has largely ignored Putin\u2019s proposal, possibly due to a narrative that portrays Russia as reckless. The author contends that Putin\u2019s move is not altruistic but a strategic calculation: Russia, having modernized over 90% of its nuclear triad, seeks to project responsibility and shift blame to Washington if the U.S. refuses. The U.S. response has been insufficient, and strained relations post-Ukraine negotiations have stalled talks. There is growing pressure to include China in future agreements, but China has rejected participation in a U.S.-Russia framework. The author warns that demanding a multilateral treaty as a precondition risks collapsing the existing bilateral treaty, removing the last enforceable limits on nuclear arsenals. The article cautions that Europe\u2019s misinterpretation of Russia\u2019s gesture as weakness is dangerous, as Russia is not vulnerable but confident in its deterrent. Without New START, verification, data sharing, and notifications would cease, increasing the risk of miscalculation, accidents, and an unregulated arms race. The collapse of the INF Treaty already reduced reaction times to minutes, heightening danger. The author emphasizes that even a one-year extension provides critical time for diplomacy and maintains predictability, which is better than chaos. The decision to accept or reject the extension will determine global security for decades. The treaty expires in February 2026, and delay risks a future without rules, limits, or trust. The writer, M A Hossain, a political and defense analyst based in Bangladesh, concludes that September 2025 may be remembered as a missed opportunity if leadership remains in stalemate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 02:56 AM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.nation.com.pk/01-Oct-2025/cold-war-echoes)\n\n**Putin Attempts to Pressure Trump Administration: ISW Explains the Rationale Behind Nuclear Weapon Statements**\nOn 22 September 2025, Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would continue to observe the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START\u2011III) for an additional year beyond its scheduled expiration in February 2026, while simultaneously threatening the Trump administration to '\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u0433\u0438'. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) explain that these remarks are part of a Kremlin strategy of '\u0440\u0435\u0444\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044e', aimed at coercing the West into decisions that benefit Russia and divert attention from the Ukraine conflict. The ISW notes that Russia has repeatedly violated international agreements since 2000, including the Open\u2011Skies Treaty, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty, the Intermediate\u2011Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and the Chemical Weapons Convention, and that it continues to use prohibited chemical weapons in Ukraine and against European opponents. The article also highlights that the Russian defence industry faces internal challenges\u2014economic sanctions, supply\u2011chain bottlenecks, and a shortage of skilled personnel\u2014yet prioritises funding for drones and missile production, while tank and aviation factories operate at capacity and focus on maintenance and upgrades. ISW warns that this policy creates an imbalance, with the defence sector expanding at the expense of civilian industry. In response to Russia\u2019s demands for a new START\u2011III negotiation, the White House said President Trump was 'informed' of the proposal, and the U.S. president will comment on the offer.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 07:32 AM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/politics-news/putin-pyitaetsya-davit-na-administratsiyu-trampa-v-isw-obyasnili-chto-stoit-za-zayavleniyami-o-yadernom-oruzhii.htm)\n\n**Expert calls on Trump to agree to Putin's New Start offer - RIA  --  RT World News**\nThe Arms Control Association (ACA) executive director Daryl Kimball urged U.S. President Donald Trump to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s offer to keep the New START nuclear treaty in force after its scheduled expiration on February\u202f5\u202f2026.

The statement was framed in the context of Moscow\u2011Washington relations. Newsweek titled the story \u2018\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u044f\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0438\u2019. The Washington Post noted that the impending expiry of the treaty amid a pause in dialogue heightened concerns among arms\u2011control advocates. The Independent said that maintaining limits would ease pressure on the U.S. and Russia in negotiations about \u2018what to do next\u2019. The New\u202fYork\u202fTimes argued that Moscow seeks to separate Ukraine\u2011related measures from arms\u2011control and economic talks, a stance the U.S. rejects. G1 highlighted attempts to restore bilateral ties, citing a meeting between Putin and former U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska in August, but warned it is a laborious process fraught with tension. India Today reported that Trump is interested in a new arms\u2011control agreement that would include China, and the Washington Post added that \u2018He (Trump \u2013 \u0440\u0435\u0434.), \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0434 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u2019. The former White House administration had indicated that President Trump had the capacity to negotiate a START extension. Putin had previously announced on 21 February 2023 that Russia was suspending participation in the START treaty, stressing that the country was not withdrawing from the agreement. He said that before resuming talks, Russia needed to understand what France and the United Kingdom were demanding and how to account for their NATO strike capabilities. The official notice of suspension was sent to the U.S. on 28 February. In early June 2023, Washington responded by halting the transmission of information about the status and location of its strategic weapons under the treaty, revoking inspection visas for Russian specialists, and refusing to issue new ones. It also stopped providing telemetry data on U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines. At the end of December 2024, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reminded that Russia still adhered to quantitative limits on strategic weapons under the treaty despite its suspension, and that until the U.S. abandons its anti\u2011Russian stance, \u2018we will not engage in negotiations with them on arms control\u2019.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 05:14 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250922/rossiya-2043611033.html)\n\n**Putin warns global nuclear arms control system has been destroyed, offers one-year extension of pact with US**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned that the global nuclear arms\u2011control system has been destroyed and offered to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States for one year if Washington commits to the same. The treaty, signed in 2010, limits each side to no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 missiles or bombers and includes on\u2011site inspections. It is due to expire on February\u00a05\u00a02026. Speaking at a Security Council meeting, Putin said the extension would be in the interests of global non\u2011proliferation and could facilitate dialogue on a successor agreement. He added that Russia would be prepared to continue adhering to the treaty\u2019s central numerical limits for one year beyond its expiration, stating, 'Based on an analysis of the situation, we will make a decision on whether to maintain these voluntary self\u2011imposed restrictions,' and that the extension would only be viable if the United States did not take steps that undermined the existing balance of deterrence. The treaty has faced challenges: on\u2011site inspections have not taken place since 2020, and in February\u00a02023 Putin announced a suspension of Russia\u2019s participation, arguing that allowing U.S. inspectors access to Russian facilities was unacceptable while Washington and its NATO allies pursued Moscow\u2019s defeat in Ukraine. Despite the suspension, the Kremlin maintained that Russia would continue observing the limits on nuclear arsenals. With over four months to the accord\u2019s expiry, no talks on renewal or replacement have begun, and differences over the war in Ukraine remain a key obstacle. Trump has previously expressed interest in negotiating a new agreement that would include China, but no formal discussions have started. Putin said the current situation in global security was deteriorating, citing new risks and the collapse of the arms\u2011control system, and reiterated that Russia is not seeking an arms race but is willing to extend New START for one year if the United States reciprocates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/putin-warns-global-nuclear-arms-control-system-has-been-destroyed-offers-one-year-extension-of-pact-with-us/cid/2124451)\n\n**Putin offers one-year extension of last US-Russia nuclear arms treaty**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced on Monday that he is willing to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New\u202fStart) with the United States for one year, contingent on a reciprocal extension by President Donald\u202fTrump. The New\u202fStart treaty, signed in 2010, is the last remaining arms\u2011control agreement between the two nuclear powers and limits the number of deployed strategic warheads and the delivery systems that can carry them. It is set to expire on 5\u202fFebruary\u202f2026. In a speech to Russia\u2019s Security Council, Putin said, 'Russia is prepared to continue adhering to the central numerical limits under the New\u202fStart Treaty for one year after 5\u202fFebruary\u202f2026.' He added, 'Subsequently, based on an analysis of the situation, we will make a decision on whether to maintain these voluntary self\u2011imposed restrictions. We believe that this measure will only be viable if the United States acts in a similar manner and does not take steps that undermine or violate the existing balance of deterrence capabilities.' The proposal aims to preserve global non\u2011proliferation interests and open the door for future talks on a successor agreement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/russias-putin-offers-one-year-extension-of-nuclear-arms-treaty-with-us-if-trump-does-the-same-2791499-2025-09-22)\n\n**Global risk rises as Russia walks away from nuclear pact - Asia Times**\nRussia has announced its withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed in 1987, citing changes to its nuclear doctrine that make it easier to use nuclear weapons. This decision has raised concerns about the future of nuclear deterrence and the danger of global nuclear proliferation. The move comes after a spat between US President Donald Trump and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and just days before the deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine. The INF treaty was a key agreement between the US and Soviet Union to reduce the number of ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles. Russia's decision to withdraw from the treaty only concerns ground-based missile systems, but the future of the New Start treaty, which limits the number of deployed strategic missiles, warheads and launchers, is also in doubt. The US and Russia are the most heavily armed nuclear powers, with an estimated 5,580 and 5,225 warheads respectively. The true power of nuclear weapons lies not in their destructive capacity, but in their ability to be used to maneuver and protect political power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2025/08/global-risk-rises-as-russia-walks-away-from-nuclear-pact/)\n\n**Trump wants new nuclear talks with Russia**\nUS President Donald Trump has expressed interest in resuming negotiations with Russia to maintain existing restrictions on nuclear weapons. The New START treaty, which limits warheads and their delivery means, is set to expire on February 5, 2026. Trump stated, 'That's not an agreement you want expiring. We're starting to work on that.' He emphasized the importance of dialogue between Russia and the US on arms control, particularly concerning strategic stability, saying, 'When you take off nuclear restrictions, that's a big problem.' Trump also highlighted the need for 'an appropriate level of trust' between the two nations. This comes after relations between the US and Russia deteriorated over allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and the conflict in Ukraine. Trump's administration previously withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty, leading to Moscow accusing Washington of dismantling the global arms control system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 11:12 PM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/622011-trump-russia-nuclear-talks/)\n\n**Trump wants new nuclear talks with Russia  --  RT World News**\nUS President Donald Trump has expressed interest in resuming negotiations with Russia to maintain restrictions on nuclear weapons.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014including US foreign policy, arms control law and negotiation, international relations (realism, neoliberalism, regime theory), political science, and security studies\u2014the consensus is that the likelihood of the Trump administration making a formal attempt to withdraw from any of the seven major international arms control treaties before January 1, 2026, is low but not zero. Experts note that while Trump's first term featured withdrawals from the INF, Open Skies, and JCPOA, there is currently no public evidence, legal action, or credible reporting of active withdrawal moves from New START or any of the other core agreements (NPT, CWC, BWC, CCW, OST, CTBT). Most arguments point to Trump's recent openness to extending New START, strong bipartisan and allied support for existing arms control regimes, bureaucratic inertia, and the short time frame to the resolution window as powerful constraints against withdrawal. The only plausible Yes scenario would require an unforeseen crisis (such as drastic escalation with Russia) or a dramatic, sudden policy reversal, but no signals of such events are present as of October 2025. Withdrawal from foundational regimes like NPT or CWC is regarded as extremely unlikely. The base rate of such US actions is rare, and all indicators\u2014including negotiation posture, legal hurdles, and the high reputational costs\u2014support a No outcome. Final assigned probabilities across the experts range from 7% to 13%, with the majority clustering between 7% and 10%.",
