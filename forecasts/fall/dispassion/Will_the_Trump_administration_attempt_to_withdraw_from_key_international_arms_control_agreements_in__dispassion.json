The current context is defined by a combination of diplomatic opportunity (Putin's extension proposal), status quo inertia, and heightened scrutiny of arms control in the wake of prior withdrawals. The fine print specifies that only formal, concrete actions count\u2014not rhetoric or reviews. Given the time remaining (less than three months) and the lack of any credible reporting of a formal withdrawal attempt, the base rate for such an action in this narrow timeframe is low. The only plausible candidate for withdrawal is New START, and all current evidence indicates interest in maintaining some form of arms control, at least through voluntary limits or a short extension. Thus, the probability of a formal attempt to withdraw from any of the seven agreements before January 1, 2026, is low, though not zero, due to Trump's historical willingness to make abrupt moves.",

There are no credible reports of moves against CWC, NPT, BWC, CCW, or OST. Absent a crisis or major escalation, the status quo bias and institutional inertia make a withdrawal attempt before January 1, 2026, unlikely.

While the probability of a Yes outcome is low, your model could be strengthened by incorporating a small but real probability for an abrupt, crisis-driven, or performative withdrawal attempt\u2014especially as a means of coercive diplomacy or domestic posturing. This tail risk, while not dominant, justifies a probability modestly higher than the 8% you suggest, and should be explicitly addressed within the rational choice framework."

You are correct to stress that New START's fate is not only a matter of presidential preference but is also shaped by broader regime legitimacy and alliance politics, making formal withdrawal highly unlikely absent a major, acute crisis. Your argument that passive expiration or stalled talks do not meet the resolution criteria is particularly important, as it clarifies the distinction between mere inaction and a formal withdrawal attempt\u2014a nuance sometimes missed in other approaches. The tail risk from Trump's iconoclastic style is acknowledged, but you rightly keep it subordinate to the institutional and reputational constraints.

You rightly note that letting New START expire removes the need for formal withdrawal, and for the other treaties the political and strategic costs are even higher. Given the only plausible trigger would be a crisis of a magnitude not currently signaled in the news, and given the fine print's strict requirements for formal action, your estimate could be more tightly anchored to the base rate and the overwhelming absence of preparatory signals.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s first term saw a pattern of withdrawing from international arms control agreements, including:\n\n* **INF Treaty (**[**2019**](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/article/article/1924779/us-withdraws-from-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty/)**)** \u2013 U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.\n* **Open Skies Treaty (**[**2020**](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-12/news/us-completes-open-skies-treaty-withdrawal)**)** \u2013 Trump announced withdrawal, citing Russian non-compliance.\n* **Iran Nuclear Deal (**[**2018**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html)**)** \u2013 The U.S. exited the JCPOA, leading to renewed tensions.\n\nWith Trump's return to office in 2025, there is renewed concern that his administration may withdraw from key arms control agreements, particularly those seen as restricting U.S. military capabilities. The agreements most at risk include:\n\n1. [**New START**](https://www.state.gov/new-start-treaty) **(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty)**, the last remaining U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control treaty, limiting strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems. It is set to expire in 2026, but there are concerns that Trump may refuse renewal or suspend compliance before then.\n2. [**The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)**](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention), a global ban on chemical weapons with strong bipartisan support, but potential friction due to compliance disputes with China and Russia.\n3. [**The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**](https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/nuclear/npt/), the cornerstone of global nuclear non-proliferation. While withdrawal is unlikely, Trump has expressed skepticism toward arms control constraints in the past.\n4. [**The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)**](https://www.ctbto.org/our-mission/the-treaty), though never ratified by the U.S., Trump officials previously floated the idea of resuming nuclear testing\u2014potentially violating the spirit of the treaty.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36025,\"question_id\":35459}}`",

Legally binding action: The administration takes executive action, submits a withdrawal request to Congress (where required), or engages in legal or procedural steps toward exiting an agreement.\n3.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov stated, 'We welcome this statement and believe it already provides grounds for optimism that the United States supports this initiative from Putin.' Putin, who had proposed the extension on September 22, emphasized that it would only be viable if the U.S. acted in a similar manner and did not take actions undermining the current strategic deterrent balance. He labeled a potential U.S. withdrawal from the treaty\u2014signed in April 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev\u2014as 'erroneous' and 'short-sighted' from 'many perspectives.' Trump responded to reporters at the White House the previous day by calling Putin\u2019s proposal a 'good idea.' Russia suspended the treaty\u2019s implementation, though not formally denounced it, on February 21, 2023, which has since prevented Western specialists from inspecting Russian nuclear facilities. START III limits each side to a maximum of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 strategic delivery systems across land, sea, and air.

The New START Treaty, signed in 2010 by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev and extended in 2021 by Putin and President Joe Biden, expires on February 5, 2026. Strategic nuclear weapons are long-range systems designed to impact the outcome of war by targeting centers of power, command structures, or critical infrastructure. Russia and the U.S. together possess about 87% of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads\u20145,459 and 5,177 respectively, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). Arms control treaties originated after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis to reduce the risk of miscommunication and slow the arms race. However, with rising tensions over Ukraine and both nations modernizing arsenals, most treaties have collapsed, with each side blaming the other. Key issues include: U.S. plans for the $175-billion Golden Dome space-based missile defense system, which Russia views as destabilizing; mutual accusations over new weapons systems\u2014Russia\u2019s Oreshnik, Kinzhal, and Avangard, and U.S. strategic capabilities; divergent views on tactical nuclear weapons, with Russia holding 1,477 non-strategic warheads and the U.S. 200; U.S. superiority in strategic nuclear submarines; and the inclusion of China, which has about 600 warheads and is not willing to negotiate with nations with larger arsenals. Putin warned that Russia would conduct a nuclear test if another power does, citing intelligence of preparations by an unnamed country. The future of the one-year extension remains uncertain, as Putin stated further voluntary limits depend on U.S. actions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:25 AM\nSource:[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/could-us-russia-extend-last-nuclear-weapons-treaty-2025-10-06/)\n\n**Trump suggests willing to extend arms control deal with Russia | News Flash**\nUS President Donald Trump stated on October 6, 2025, that he is open to extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia, following a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a one-year extension.

The offer, made by Putin in September 2025, calls for both the U.S. and Russia to uphold the existing limits without formally renewing the treaty, contingent on mutual agreement. The proposal comes amid heightened tensions, including reports of Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace and continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Russia\u2019s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, emphasized Moscow\u2019s expectation for a formal response from Washington, stressing the importance of reducing global nuclear risks. While both nations are exploring arms control measures, no verifiable or binding agreement has been reached.

The INF Treaty, signed in 1987 between Reagan and Gorbatschow, banned land-based nuclear missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. The treaty effectively ended in 2019 after the United States withdrew, and now Russia has formally ended its own adherence. This move signals Russia's intent to resume development and deployment of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. In response, the U.S. plans to station new nuclear-capable systems in Germany, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, SM-6 interceptors, and hypersonic weapons\u2014systems with greater range than previously deployed. Russia has already deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, capable of reaching German cities. The situation has prompted concerns across Europe, particularly in Germany, as the continent risks becoming a potential theater for nuclear conflict. Experts warn that the collapse of the INF Treaty marks the end of an era of mutual restraint, and the prospects for new arms control agreements appear increasingly uncertain. The article notes that the timing coincides with heightened U.S.-Russia tensions, including alleged provocations from Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, though no direct causal link is established.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[news.de](https://www.news.de/politik/858836666/wladimir-putin-russland-ruestet-sich-weiter-heftig-auf-deutschland-koennte-bald-zur-zielscheibe-werden/1/)\n\n**Cold War Echoes**\nOn September 22, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral proposal to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) for one year, until February 2026. The treaty, signed by Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev in 2010, limits U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 launchers, with rigorous verification mechanisms. Russia has consistently adhered to the treaty, allowing U.S. inspections and data exchanges. In contrast, the U.S. has withdrawn from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (2002), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and the Open Skies Treaty, weakening global arms control. The article argues that Western media has largely ignored Putin\u2019s proposal, possibly due to a narrative that portrays Russia as reckless. The author contends that Putin\u2019s move is not altruistic but a strategic calculation: Russia, having modernized over 90% of its nuclear triad, seeks to project responsibility and shift blame to Washington if the U.S. refuses. The U.S. response has been insufficient, and strained relations post-Ukraine negotiations have stalled talks. There is growing pressure to include China in future agreements, but China has rejected participation in a U.S.-Russia framework. The author warns that demanding a multilateral treaty as a precondition risks collapsing the existing bilateral treaty, removing the last enforceable limits on nuclear arsenals. The article cautions that Europe\u2019s misinterpretation of Russia\u2019s gesture as weakness is dangerous, as Russia is not vulnerable but confident in its deterrent. Without New START, verification, data sharing, and notifications would cease, increasing the risk of miscalculation, accidents, and an unregulated arms race. The collapse of the INF Treaty already reduced reaction times to minutes, heightening danger. The author emphasizes that even a one-year extension provides critical time for diplomacy and maintains predictability, which is better than chaos. The decision to accept or reject the extension will determine global security for decades. The treaty expires in February 2026, and delay risks a future without rules, limits, or trust. The writer, M A Hossain, a political and defense analyst based in Bangladesh, concludes that September 2025 may be remembered as a missed opportunity if leadership remains in stalemate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 02:56 AM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.nation.com.pk/01-Oct-2025/cold-war-echoes)\n\n**Putin Attempts to Pressure Trump Administration: ISW Explains the Rationale Behind Nuclear Weapon Statements**\nOn 22 September 2025, Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would continue to observe the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START\u2011III) for an additional year beyond its scheduled expiration in February 2026, while simultaneously threatening the Trump administration to '\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u0433\u0438'.

The ISW notes that Russia has repeatedly violated international agreements since 2000, including the Open\u2011Skies Treaty, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty, the Intermediate\u2011Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and the Chemical Weapons Convention, and that it continues to use prohibited chemical weapons in Ukraine and against European opponents. The article also highlights that the Russian defence industry faces internal challenges\u2014economic sanctions, supply\u2011chain bottlenecks, and a shortage of skilled personnel\u2014yet prioritises funding for drones and missile production, while tank and aviation factories operate at capacity and focus on maintenance and upgrades. ISW warns that this policy creates an imbalance, with the defence sector expanding at the expense of civilian industry.

Kimball described Russia\u2019s suspension as a \"mistaken and short\u2011sighted step\".\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 06:53 PM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/625081-expert-trump-agree-putin-start/)\n\n**World Media React to Putin\u2019s Statement on DSN**\nOn 22 September 2025, RIA Novosti reported that world media reacted to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s statement that Russia is ready to continue observing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) limits for a year after 5 February 2026. The statement was framed in the context of Moscow\u2011Washington relations. Newsweek titled the story \u2018\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u044f\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0438\u2019. The Washington Post noted that the impending expiry of the treaty amid a pause in dialogue heightened concerns among arms\u2011control advocates. The Independent said that maintaining limits would ease pressure on the U.S. and Russia in negotiations about \u2018what to do next\u2019. The New\u202fYork\u202fTimes argued that Moscow seeks to separate Ukraine\u2011related measures from arms\u2011control and economic talks, a stance the U.S. rejects. G1 highlighted attempts to restore bilateral ties, citing a meeting between Putin and former U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska in August, but warned it is a laborious process fraught with tension. India Today reported that Trump is interested in a new arms\u2011control agreement that would include China, and the Washington Post added that \u2018He (Trump \u2013 \u0440\u0435\u0434.), \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0434 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u2019. The former White House administration had indicated that President Trump had the capacity to negotiate a START extension. Putin had previously announced on 21 February 2023 that Russia was suspending participation in the START treaty, stressing that the country was not withdrawing from the agreement. He said that before resuming talks, Russia needed to understand what France and the United Kingdom were demanding and how to account for their NATO strike capabilities. The official notice of suspension was sent to the U.S. on 28 February. In early June 2023, Washington responded by halting the transmission of information about the status and location of its strategic weapons under the treaty, revoking inspection visas for Russian specialists, and refusing to issue new ones. It also stopped providing telemetry data on U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines. At the end of December 2024, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reminded that Russia still adhered to quantitative limits on strategic weapons under the treaty despite its suspension, and that until the U.S. abandons its anti\u2011Russian stance, \u2018we will not engage in negotiations with them on arms control\u2019.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 05:14 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250922/rossiya-2043611033.html)\n\n**Putin warns global nuclear arms control system has been destroyed, offers one-year extension of pact with US**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned that the global nuclear arms\u2011control system has been destroyed and offered to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States for one year if Washington commits to the same. The treaty, signed in 2010, limits each side to no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 missiles or bombers and includes on\u2011site inspections. It is due to expire on February\u00a05\u00a02026. Speaking at a Security Council meeting, Putin said the extension would be in the interests of global non\u2011proliferation and could facilitate dialogue on a successor agreement. He added that Russia would be prepared to continue adhering to the treaty\u2019s central numerical limits for one year beyond its expiration, stating, 'Based on an analysis of the situation, we will make a decision on whether to maintain these voluntary self\u2011imposed restrictions,' and that the extension would only be viable if the United States did not take steps that undermined the existing balance of deterrence. The treaty has faced challenges: on\u2011site inspections have not taken place since 2020, and in February\u00a02023 Putin announced a suspension of Russia\u2019s participation, arguing that allowing U.S. inspectors access to Russian facilities was unacceptable while Washington and its NATO allies pursued Moscow\u2019s defeat in Ukraine. Despite the suspension, the Kremlin maintained that Russia would continue observing the limits on nuclear arsenals. With over four months to the accord\u2019s expiry, no talks on renewal or replacement have begun, and differences over the war in Ukraine remain a key obstacle. Trump has previously expressed interest in negotiating a new agreement that would include China, but no formal discussions have started. Putin said the current situation in global security was deteriorating, citing new risks and the collapse of the arms\u2011control system, and reiterated that Russia is not seeking an arms race but is willing to extend New START for one year if the United States reciprocates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/putin-warns-global-nuclear-arms-control-system-has-been-destroyed-offers-one-year-extension-of-pact-with-us/cid/2124451)\n\n**Putin offers one-year extension of last US-Russia nuclear arms treaty**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced on Monday that he is willing to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New\u202fStart) with the United States for one year, contingent on a reciprocal extension by President Donald\u202fTrump. The New\u202fStart treaty, signed in 2010, is the last remaining arms\u2011control agreement between the two nuclear powers and limits the number of deployed strategic warheads and the delivery systems that can carry them. It is set to expire on 5\u202fFebruary\u202f2026. In a speech to Russia\u2019s Security Council, Putin said, 'Russia is prepared to continue adhering to the central numerical limits under the New\u202fStart Treaty for one year after 5\u202fFebruary\u202f2026.' He added, 'Subsequently, based on an analysis of the situation, we will make a decision on whether to maintain these voluntary self\u2011imposed restrictions. We believe that this measure will only be viable if the United States acts in a similar manner and does not take steps that undermine or violate the existing balance of deterrence capabilities.' The proposal aims to preserve global non\u2011proliferation interests and open the door for future talks on a successor agreement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/russias-putin-offers-one-year-extension-of-nuclear-arms-treaty-with-us-if-trump-does-the-same-2791499-2025-09-22)\n\n**Global risk rises as Russia walks away from nuclear pact - Asia Times**\nRussia has announced its withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed in 1987, citing changes to its nuclear doctrine that make it easier to use nuclear weapons. This decision has raised concerns about the future of nuclear deterrence and the danger of global nuclear proliferation. The move comes after a spat between US President Donald Trump and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and just days before the deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine. The INF treaty was a key agreement between the US and Soviet Union to reduce the number of ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles. Russia's decision to withdraw from the treaty only concerns ground-based missile systems, but the future of the New Start treaty, which limits the number of deployed strategic missiles, warheads and launchers, is also in doubt. The US and Russia are the most heavily armed nuclear powers, with an estimated 5,580 and 5,225 warheads respectively. The true power of nuclear weapons lies not in their destructive capacity, but in their ability to be used to maneuver and protect political power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2025/08/global-risk-rises-as-russia-walks-away-from-nuclear-pact/)\n\n**Trump wants new nuclear talks with Russia**\nUS President Donald Trump has expressed interest in resuming negotiations with Russia to maintain existing restrictions on nuclear weapons. The New START treaty, which limits warheads and their delivery means, is set to expire on February 5, 2026. Trump stated, 'That's not an agreement you want expiring. We're starting to work on that.' He emphasized the importance of dialogue between Russia and the US on arms control, particularly concerning strategic stability, saying, 'When you take off nuclear restrictions, that's a big problem.' Trump also highlighted the need for 'an appropriate level of trust' between the two nations. This comes after relations between the US and Russia deteriorated over allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and the conflict in Ukraine. Trump's administration previously withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty, leading to Moscow accusing Washington of dismantling the global arms control system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 11:12 PM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/622011-trump-russia-nuclear-talks/)\n\n**Trump wants new nuclear talks with Russia  --  RT World News**\nUS President Donald Trump has expressed interest in resuming negotiations with Russia to maintain restrictions on nuclear weapons.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts assess a low probability that the Trump administration will attempt to withdraw from key international arms control agreements before January 1, 2026. Across expert domains\u2014ranging from U.S. foreign policy, arms control law, international relations (both realist and institutionalist), regime theory, security and deterrence studies, and rational choice theory\u2014there is a clear consensus: while Trump\u2019s first term set a precedent for withdrawing from some agreements (INF Treaty, Open Skies, JCPOA), the current public signals and diplomatic climate are markedly different.\n\nRecent Trump statements repeatedly favor extending New START, with openness to Russian proposals and no public or bureaucratic moves toward formal withdrawal from any of the seven covered treaties (New START, CWC, NPT, BWC, CCW, OST, CTBT). Experts uniformly reject the idea that mere rhetoric or exploratory reviews would meet the strict resolution criteria, emphasizing that only formal, concrete steps\u2014such as official notification, legal suspension, or significant defunding\u2014would count.\n\nBase rates of U.S. withdrawal from foundational arms control agreements like the NPT, CWC, BWC, and OST are described as extremely low or nearly zero; most historical withdrawals targeted less entrenched, more controversial agreements. Institutional inertia, bipartisan Congressional and military support, allied pressure, reputational risks, and bureaucratic hurdles all weigh strongly against the likelihood of formal withdrawal attempts in the next three months. The most plausible candidate for withdrawal\u2014New START\u2014is, according to all available signals, the subject of positive engagement and possible extension, further lowering immediate risk.\n\nWhile experts acknowledge Trump\u2019s unpredictability and the non-zero risk of abrupt policy shifts in response to a crisis (such as major escalation in Ukraine), all judge the probability to remain well below 20%, with most forecasts clustering between 6% and 15%. The consensus judgment is that the Trump administration will maintain participation in all seven arms control agreements through January 1, 2026, absent a dramatic and currently unforeseeable downturn in international security or domestic political dynamics.",
