International undergraduates are a small but crucial part of the four-year enrollment pool, and their concentration at four-year institutions\u2014especially among 18-24-year-olds\u2014means the impact will be disproportionately felt in the numerator. Domestically, the rate is also pressured downward by declining high school grads, growing doubts about college value, and tightening institutional finances. While colleges are actively countering these trends through aggressive recruitment, direct admission, and greater aid, these efforts seem insufficient to fully offset the scale of the international decline and broader economic/demographic headwinds. The base rate trend and institutional inertia provide some buoyancy, but the magnitude of the 2025 international shock is likely just enough to tip the rate below the 26.6% threshold.

The 2025 environment is unusually negative: a catastrophic international student collapse (17% drop in new enrollments, especially from key countries like India and China), ongoing domestic demographic shrinkage, and reduced perceived value. However, international undergraduates constitute only about 5\u20136% of four-year college enrollments, and not all the loss in new international students translates to a proportional drop in the total enrolled population in a single year. Domestic colleges are taking aggressive steps to fill seats, and some international enrollment losses may be deferred rather than lost entirely. The magnitude of the 2025 international shock is likely the largest single-year negative in decades, but given the starting point, the time lag in student pipelines (most undergraduates are multi-year), and institutional countermeasures, it is still somewhat more likely that the 2025 enrollment rate will stay barely above the 26.6% threshold.

As international students have been a key bulwark against domestic stagnation or decline in 4-year college enrollments, this shock is severe. On the domestic side, declining cohort size and public skepticism about the value of college, alongside aggressive labor market disruptions from AI/automation and reduced federal funding, further erode the enrollment base. Colleges are responding by lowering admissions barriers and increasing aid to slow the decline, but these measures are less effective in a shrinking youth cohort and don\u2019t fully compensate for the international shortfall. Base rates suggest that such a steep drop (from 29.9% to below 26.6%) in a decade is rare; however, the scale of the international enrollment collapse and stagnant domestic demand make it plausible this year. The news points to a real risk of breaching the threshold, but not certainty\u2014historical stickiness and institutional adaptation could keep the rate just above. Weighing all factors, I judge the probability Caplan wins (enrollment rate >26.6%) to be below even odds but not negligible, as institutional inertia and late-year visa improvements may not show up in 2025 enrollment data.

Domestic recruitment countermeasures may partially offset this, but likely not enough to fully neutralize the effect of the international student collapse, especially given further headwinds from funding cuts and declining perceived value. While some international students remain in the system due to OPT and longer graduate program durations, the question targets 18-24-year-olds (mostly undergrads, not grad students or post-baccs). Given these compounding negatives and the specific, unprecedented magnitude of international enrollment loss in 2025, the risk of breaching the 26.6% threshold is now substantial\u2014much higher than in prior years.

Institutional countermeasures (easing admissions, more aid, aggressive recruiting) will partially offset these declines, but the magnitude of the international student collapse is unusually large and sudden, and cannot be fully compensated by the stagnant or declining domestic pool. Human capital theory suggests that unless the wage premium for a degree rebounds decisively, and/or the labor market collapses enough to push more young people into college as a shelter, the downward trend will persist in the near term. The news confirms that the 2025 cycle was particularly disastrous for international student inflow, with a 17% drop that is almost certainly the largest single-year decline in decades.

Still, institutional inertia, the slow nature of such statistics, and the fact that the denominator (18-24-year-olds) is also shrinking (which can moderate the effect) mean the median scenario is very close to the threshold.

The U.S. higher education system is showing signs of crisis, with institutions forced into emergency recruitment and international students increasingly choosing competitor nations. While colleges are loosening standards and offering more aid to mitigate the decline, the magnitude of the international and domestic shocks in 2025 appears unprecedented. The most recent available data (as of questions closing) suggests a sharp enough drop that the 26.6% threshold is at serious risk. However, because the denominator (total 18-24-year-olds) is also shrinking, and U.S. institutions may have partially offset losses through aggressive recruitment among domestic students, a small chance remains that the enrollment rate hovers just above the threshold.

Furthermore, the denominator (18-24-year-olds) is declining, but the shrinkage is gradual and unlikely to fully offset the scale of the international and domestic declines in the numerator for a single year's data. Your optimism about the effectiveness of institutional countermeasures (direct admission, fee waivers) may be overstated: these tactics can fill seats at marginal institutions but are unlikely to compensate fully at the aggregate, national level given the depth of the 2025 shocks. Therefore, the odds of breaching the 26.6% threshold are more substantial than your 63% estimate implies, and a more cautious, lower probability for a YES outcome is warranted."

I would specifically defend your attention to the denominator effect: while the 18-24-year-old cohort is shrinking (which could superficially buoy the rate), the magnitude of losses in the numerator\u2014particularly among international undergraduates\u2014makes it unlikely that this will fully offset the impact.

This approach recognizes both the statistical stickiness of the metric and the plausibility of a sharp enough drop to breach the threshold.

The 17% drop in new international students, compounded by a 44% drop in Indian arrivals, is not a typical cyclical fluctuation but a system-wide, acute shock. While you correctly note that total enrollment is a stock and not all losses appear instantly, this shock coincides with a period of domestic demographic contraction and a negative attitudinal shift toward higher education among U.S. youth. Institutional countermeasures, while helpful at the margins, are unlikely to fully compensate for simultaneous international and domestic headwinds, especially in a single cycle. The denominator's gradual shrinkage also offers only modest relief.

Moreover, the compounding effect of negative narratives and peer networks will likely deter future applicants as well, making 2025 a structural break rather than a temporary setback.

First, total enrollment is a stock variable, not a flow; while new international undergrad entrants are down sharply, the aggregate effect on total enrollment in this age band is diluted by multi-year persistence of existing cohorts and by the fact that not all international losses are in the 18-24, four-year group.

I win if it\u2019s fallen less.  Since the current rate is 29.9%, he wins if the rate is 26.6% or less.

Only Some**\nWall Street expects a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, with a 90% probability according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. However, the article questions whether this traditional monetary policy will be effective in today's economy, which is marked by structural shifts. Recent data shows a 32,000-job decline in private payrolls, 1.17 million layoff announcements for 2025 (54% higher than the same period last year), cooling wage growth, falling consumer confidence, and rising delinquencies across credit cards, car loans, and student debt. The labor market is showing significant cracks. Historically, rate cuts stimulate the economy by lowering borrowing costs, encouraging investment, hiring, income growth, and consumer spending. However, in today\u2019s K-shaped economy, where wealth concentration is increasing, rate cuts disproportionately benefit higher-income 'Upper-K' Americans who own assets, while lower-income 'Lower-K' Americans\u2014whose purchasing power is eroding\u2014see limited relief. The article argues that automation, AI, and robotics are driving a non-cyclical, structural shift that rate cuts cannot reverse. Even as rate cuts may slightly reduce financial pressure for lower-income households, they do not address job displacement caused by automation. The article concludes that rate cuts will likely boost asset prices and benefit investors more than workers, accelerating wealth concentration. It advocates for a strategic shift toward asset ownership\u2014particularly in AI and automation-driven sectors\u2014as the new path to financial security, framing this as 'American Dream 2.0.'

According to a survey of 828 U.S. institutions, 96% reported that visa delays were a key factor in enrollment declines, and 91% reported visa denials affecting admitted students\u2014many of whom had already paid deposits and received Form I-20s. The crisis intensified after a three-week visa processing pause from May 27 to June 18, which disrupted the peak application window for fall enrollment and created a cascading backlog. Wait times varied dramatically by location, with students in India, China, Nigeria, and Vietnam facing months-long delays, turning the process into a geographic lottery. Denial rates rose sharply, with Section 214(b), administrative processing, and documentation issues cited as common reasons\u2014despite applicants being academically qualified. In contrast, competitor countries like Canada, the UK, Australia, and Germany have streamlined, reliable systems with faster processing, clear timelines, and post-study work rights, leading many students to choose alternatives.

However, foreign enrollment dropped 17% from fall 2024 to 2025, with Chinese student numbers falling from 317,299 in 2019 to 265,919 in 2024-25 due to stricter U.S. visa policies, geopolitical tensions, and increased competition from universities in Australia, Canada, and the UK.

Unlike traditional fraud law (mens rea), which requires proof of intent, this new standard permits lawsuits even if the misrepresentation was unintentional\u2014such as a clerical error. This could expose universities, including public institutions like the University of Colorado at Boulder, to liability, potentially requiring taxpayer funding for refunds. The proposal arises amid concerns over rising student debt\u2014$1.2 trillion in 2015\u2014and low graduation rates, with less than 20% of full-time students at public four-year colleges earning degrees within four years. The article draws a parallel between education and consumer goods: just as consumers can return defective products like cars, TVs, or spoiled milk for refunds, students might reasonably expect a similar recourse if their degree fails to deliver promised outcomes, such as job placement in their field. The central question posed is whether college should come with a money-back guarantee, reflecting a broader debate about accountability, value, and consumer protection in higher education.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2016 08:34 AM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/08/26/should-college-come-with-a-money-back-guarantee.html)\n\n**Will a Rate Cut Really Help?

Ohio State (12-0 SU, 10-1-1 ATS) is favored, with the spread moving from -5.5 to -4.5 and then to -4 by Wednesday, despite sharp betting activity on Indiana +5.5 and public preference for Ohio State. Caesars Sports' Joey Feazel notes the game has major Heisman implications, with Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza a favorite over Ohio State\u2019s Julian Sayin. College football expert Paul Stone sees more significance for Indiana, as a win would be monumental for the program, while Ohio State remains in playoff contention regardless. In the SEC Championship, Georgia (11-1 SU/5-7 ATS) is a 1.5-point favorite over Alabama (10-2 SU/7-4-1 ATS), with strong early action on Georgia and concerns about Alabama\u2019s playoff chances if they lose. The total remains stable at 47.5. In the ACC Championship, Duke (7-5 SU/5-6-1 ATS) faces Virginia (10-2 SU/8-4 ATS), with Virginia moving from a 2.5-point favorite to -3.5 despite the record gap. Feazel warns that a Duke upset could lead to two non-Power 5 teams in the College Football Playoff, with James Madison, Tulane, or North Texas likely to be ranked ahead of Duke. In the Big 12 Championship, Texas Tech (11-1 SU/10-2 ATS) is a 12.5-point favorite over BYU (11-1 SU/9-3 ATS), with heavy betting on Texas Tech and a need on BYU and the Under. A $40,000 BetMGM wager on Georgia +1000 to win the national title would net $400,000 if successful. Conversely, a $615,000 multi-bet on Texas, Penn State, and Clemson all lost after those teams were eliminated, underscoring the importance of responsible betting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 06:41 PM\nSource:[FOX Sports](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-football/college-football-week-15-betting-report)\n\n**96% of US Colleges Say Visa Delays Are Killing Enrollment: Inside the State Department's Catastrophic Failure**\nA catastrophic breakdown in the U.S. student visa processing system in 2025 has led to a 17% decline in new international student enrollment, the first drop after four years of post-COVID recovery, costing the U.S. economy $1.1 billion and nearly 23,000 jobs.

Federal data show that overall college acceptance rates have risen from about 5 in 10 applicants a decade ago to 6 in 10 today. To attract students, colleges are implementing one-click applications, waiving application fees (e.g., 130 New York state colleges waived $50\u2013$90 fees in October), offering automatic admission to students who meet high school benchmarks (e.g., California State University accepts students with a C or higher in required courses), and extending unsolicited offers through the Common App\u2014210 institutions made such offers in the 2025 cycle, nearly double the previous year. Pace University offers $1,000 annual financial aid to campus visitors, as research shows visitation doubles enrollment likelihood. Despite these efforts, perceptions persist: a Pew Research Center survey found 45% of Americans ages 18\u201329 believe college admissions is harder than for their parents\u2019 generation, and over 75% find the process complex, with more than half calling it the most stressful experience in school. However, students who have already applied report lower stress levels than those preparing to apply. While direct admission and fee waivers increase applications\u2014NY state saw a 41% rise in SUNY applications during a fee-waiver month\u2014experts like James Murphy of Education Reform Now caution that such reforms primarily benefit colleges by boosting enrollment, not students, unless paired with financial aid and support. Additionally, colleges are extending deadlines, recruiting after May 1, and making standardized test scores optional (over 2,000 institutions now do so). A lawsuit has been filed against 32 schools practicing early decision, which binds students to enroll if accepted, arguing it limits financial aid negotiation. Experts like Kevin Krebs of HelloCollege emphasize that 'if you have the grades, you're going to get in' at many schools, asserting that students now hold more control over the process.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-25/college-admission-process-easier-less-stressful-as-applicant-pool-declines)\n\n**Colleges say foreign students feel 'unwelcome' in the U.S. amid big drop in international enrollment, new survey finds**\nA new survey by the Institute of International Education, based on responses from 828 U.S. colleges and universities, reveals a 17% drop in new international student enrollment for the fall 2025 semester, continuing a trend that saw a 7% decline in 2024. The decline is largely attributed to policies under the Trump administration, which targeted international education and immigration, including revoking visas of at least 1,800 foreign students (later reversed), pausing all new student visa interviews, proposing social media screening for applicants, and attempting to revoke Harvard University\u2019s ability to host international students\u2014a move blocked by a court. Nearly all institutions reporting decreased enrollment cited visa issues as a major obstacle, up from 64% during the first year of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Additionally, two-thirds of schools said foreign students now feel 'unwelcome' in the U.S., a significant increase from 25% four years ago, with a similar proportion citing America\u2019s 'social and political environment' as a deterrent. Although overall international enrollment declined by only 1%, this marks a reversal from post-pandemic growth. International students, who typically pay higher tuition and contribute $42.9 billion to the U.S. economy annually, supported over 355,000 American jobs in 2024\u201325; the current decline is projected to cost $1.1 billion and 23,000 jobs. Most international students are in graduate programs and concentrated in elite institutions on the East Coast and in California. Despite earlier hardline policies, President Trump recently adopted a softer tone, stating during a Fox News interview that reducing international enrollment too much would 'destroy our entire university and college system' and defending a plan to offer 600,000 visas to Chinese students, saying, 'It's not that I want them, but I view it as a business.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 09:48 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/colleges-say-foreign-students-feel-unwelcome-in-the-us-amid-big-drop-in-international-enrollment-new-survey-finds-214812113.html)\n\n**Trump Policies Blamed as U.S. Colleges See Sharp Drop in New International Students - Inquisitr News**\nUniversities across the United States are experiencing their steepest decline in new international student enrollment in years, with a 17% drop in new international students for the fall 2025 semester, following a 7% decline in the 2024\u20132025 academic year, according to the Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education. Campus officials attribute the downturn largely to policies under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, including a month-long pause in visa interviews over the summer, stricter vetting, and fewer available appointments, which left many admitted students unable to secure visas or arrive on time. More than half of surveyed institutions reported allowing students to defer enrollment, while a large majority said they continue to value international students for their academic and cultural contributions and financial importance\u2014nearly 60% acknowledged their role in stabilizing institutional budgets. Despite the drop in new arrivals, overall foreign student enrollment is rising due to increased participation in Optional Practical Training (OPT), which grew by 21%, and longer stays in graduate and doctoral programs. India has become the top sending country for U.S. students for the second consecutive year, with over 363,000 Indian students enrolled in 2024\u20132025, a 10% increase, while China\u2019s enrollment declined by 4% to about 266,000. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s top destination for international students, hosting roughly 1.2 million in 2024\u20132025 and contributing nearly $55 billion to the economy. However, Trump has issued mixed signals: while he recently stated that foreign students are 'good for business' and beneficial for U.S. competitiveness, his administration has enforced strict visa crackdowns and high-profile enforcement actions. University recruiters are now working to reassure prospective international students, but concerns remain over whether the decline in new enrollment\u2014falling at a double-digit rate\u2014is a temporary dip or the beginning of a long-term shift.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[The Inquisitr](https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-policies-blamed-as-u-s-colleges-see-sharp-drop-in-new-international-students)\n\n**2025 Big Bets Report: Bettor Wins Nearly $850k on $15, 17-Leg Parlay**\nA Hard Rock Bet customer won $843,475.72 on a $15, 17-leg parlay involving college football point spreads and totals across multiple conferences, including the Big Ten, SEC, ACC, Big 12, Mountain West, and Sun Belt.

According to bet365, the Dodgers were -120 money line favorites, with an over/under of 7.5 total runs. SportsLine's projection model favored the Brewers (+105) to win in 56% of 10,000 simulations, significantly higher than the implied 48.1% probability from consensus odds. The model also predicted South Alabama (-7) would cover the spread against Arkansas State in 55% of simulations and Western Kentucky (-7.5) would cover against FIU 63% of the time. The model had a profitable record in 2025, with a 35-29 win rate on MLB money-line picks, nearly 30 units of profit on home run props, and over $2,000 in returns for $100 players on college football spreads since 2024. A three-leg parlay combining these picks would yield +647 odds ($100 to win $647). The Dodgers had won Game 1 2-1, but Los Angeles was just 1-9 in its past 10 meetings with Milwaukee. Freddy Peralta was set to start for the Brewers, having allowed two earned runs or fewer in four of his last five outings. Arkansas State had lost four of its past five games and nine of its last 11 road games, while Western Kentucky was 8-2 in its past 10 meetings with FIU and 9-1 in its last 10 home games.

This decline, part of a broader 27% drop in visas issued to Indian students between March and May 2025 compared to 2024, is attributed to stricter visa policies under the Trump administration, including suspended interview slots, enhanced background checks (including social media scrutiny), rising processing fees, and tighter H-1B visa rules favoring higher-wage applicants. Indian students, who accounted for 27% of all international enrolments in U.S. universities in 2024, view the Optional Practical Training (OPT) and H-1B visa pathways as essential to their decision to study in the U.S., with a Forbes survey indicating that over half would not have enrolled if OPT were unavailable and 53% would not have applied if H-1B selection were based on wage levels. The decline threatens academic diversity and the financial stability of American universities, which rely heavily on international enrolments to offset stagnant domestic enrollment. Meanwhile, Canada, Australia, and the UK are gaining traction by offering clearer post-study work options and more predictable visa regimes. The article warns that unless current policies are reversed, the U.S. risks losing its status as the top destination for Indian students, with long-term consequences for higher education and the labor market. 'The dream of thousands of Indian students to study in the United States is losing its shine,' the article states, linking the downturn directly to 'tougher rules under the Trump administration.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 06:14 PM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/world/july-august-witness-50-drop-in-indian-students-heading-to-us-colleges-trump-s-visa-rules-to-blame-article-13596653.html)\n\n**I just won \u00a3550 on Premium\u00a0Bonds \u2014 but I\u2019m still ditching them**\nOn 23 September 2025 a 46\u2011year\u2011old mother of two recounts winning \u00a3550 on Premium Bonds, her biggest prize to date, but explains why she is considering ending her \u00a340,000 stake. She notes that the National Savings & Investments (NS&I) prize rate fell from 4.65\u202f% in September\u202f2023 to 3.6\u202f% in August\u202f2024, raising the odds of any prize to 22,000\u202fto\u202f1 versus 21,000\u202fto\u202f1, according to analyst Alice Haine. The article cites that a \u00a310,000 holding would earn an average of \u00a3360 per year, but offers no interest when no prize is won, meaning inflation erodes real value. It also reports that in September\u202f2024 more than 6\u202fmillion prizes worth over \u00a3397\u202fmillion were paid out, while the total number of bonds stood at 132,593,956,732. The author compares the \u00a34,300 won since 2020 with potential returns from fixed\u2011rate savings accounts, noting that a \u00a345,000 deposit in a 5\u2011year account at 1.55\u202f% would yield \u00a33,597, whereas a 2\u2011year account at 6.13\u202f% would yield \u00a35,686. She concludes that the lower prize rate and the lack of guaranteed interest make Premium Bonds less attractive, and she may move her money to a competitive savings account. \n\nQuotes: \n- 'The prize rate has fallen from 4.65 per cent in September 2023 to 3.6 per cent, with the odds of winning now at 22,000 to 1 vs 21,000 to 1.'\n- 'While savers wait for a win, they get no interest on their savings, so, without a prize, their cash loses value in real terms once inflation has been factored in.'\n- 'There\u2019s no escaping it: Premium Bonds don\u2019t pay interest.

Private colleges make up about 31% of all Chinese universities, including 388 ordinary undergraduate schools and 23 vocational schools.  In Guangdong, a private college reported a 5626\u2011person deficit after a second round of applications, and the Zhanjiang Technology Institute\u2019s 2025 plan of 9,086 undergraduates fell short by 2,150 (\u224824%) despite three rounds of recruitment that ultimately filled 76% of seats.  Fourteen of the 24 private undergrad schools in Guangdong had to hold supplemental enrollment to reach capacity.  The article notes that each round of recruitment in Guangdong saw score cuts of 10, 15, and 11 points, a practice mainly affecting private schools.  In Guangxi, some institutions announced a \u201cfourth round\u201d with no score cutoff, while Heilongjiang and Yunnan conducted five and six rounds, respectively.  Tuition for private colleges typically ranges from 30,000 to 50,000 yuan (\u22484,200\u20137,000 USD), higher than public institutions, and the total cost of a four\u2011year degree can reach 100,000\u2013200,000 yuan (\u224814,000\u201328,000 USD).  The article cites a 2025 nationwide high\u2011school enrollment of 13.35\u202fmillion, a decline of 70,000 from 2024, and a 2025 graduate cohort of 12.22\u202fmillion, up 430,000 from the previous year, highlighting a mismatch between supply and employment opportunities.  It also references the 1999 expansion of enrollment, which increased the number of students from 1.08\u202fmillion to 1.59\u202fmillion, and the subsequent rise in the gross enrollment rate to 60.8% in 2024, surpassing the 60% target set for the 14th Five\u2011Year Plan.  The piece concludes that the rapid expansion has led to a decline in the perceived value of university degrees and a growing \u201cundergraduate\u2011graduate imbalance.\u201d  Key quotes from the article include: \u201c'\u96f6\u6295\u6a94'\u201d, \u201c'\u53d6\u6d88\u5206\u6578\u7dda'\u201d, and \u201c'\u56db\u8f2a\u5fb5\u96c6'\u201d.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/8/28/n14582739.htm)\n\n**College World Series Odds: Track the Favorites to Win the 2025 CWS**\nThe 2025 College World Series (CWS) began on June 13 and will conclude by June 23, with the championship series between Coastal Carolina and LSU starting on June 21.

Unlike traditional fraud law (mens rea), which requires proof of intent, this new standard permits lawsuits even if the misrepresentation was unintentional\u2014such as a clerical error. This could expose universities, including public institutions like the University of Colorado at Boulder, to liability, potentially requiring taxpayer funding for refunds. The proposal arises amid concerns over rising student debt\u2014$1.2 trillion in 2015\u2014and low graduation rates, with less than 20% of full-time students at public four-year colleges earning degrees within four years. The article draws a parallel between education and consumer goods: just as consumers can return defective products like cars, TVs, or spoiled milk for refunds, students might reasonably expect a similar recourse if their degree fails to deliver promised outcomes, such as job placement in their field. The central question posed is whether college should come with a money-back guarantee, reflecting a broader debate about accountability, value, and consumer protection in higher education.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2016 08:34 AM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/08/26/should-college-come-with-a-money-back-guarantee.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters from multiple disciplinary perspectives addressed whether Bryan Caplan will win his bet that the U.S. 18\u201324-year-old four-year college enrollment rate in 2025 will exceed 26.6%. All experts grounded their analyses in base rates (historically slow declines in enrollment), the latest available NCES data, and recent highly negative news about new international student enrollments.\n\nNearly all experts identify the 2025 collapse in new international student enrollments (down 17% overall, with especially severe drops among Indian and Chinese students) as an unprecedented and highly negative shock\u2014one that disproportionately affects four-year institutions and the traditional college-age cohort. This international drop, attributed to visa chaos, hostile policies, and post-pandemic factors, is described as historically unusual and a primary driver increasing the risk that the threshold is breached. Domestic headwinds\u2014continued demographic contraction of college-age Americans, declining public faith in the value of a degree, flat or weakening labor markets, and reduced federal funding\u2014are consistently cited as secondary but compounding negative factors. \n\nMost forecasters note that institutions have aggressively tried to offset these pressures via relaxed admissions, waived fees, direct admission, and expanded financial aid. While these strategies mitigate some declines, the consensus view holds they are unlikely to fully compensate for simultaneous sharp international and domestic enrollment losses. However, the \u2018stickiness\u2019 or inertia of large-scale statistics and the gradual pace of past declines keep probabilities from falling to zero.\n\nBase rate reasoning is prominent: historically, enrollment rates have rarely declined by more than 10% in a decade absent a major societal shock. Yet virtually all forecasters judge 2025 itself to constitute such a shock, elevating the plausibility of a breach below 26.6%. Most expect the final value to be very close to the threshold, with no extreme confidence on either side.\n\nProbabilities for Caplan winning (2025 rate >26.6%) cluster between 30%\u201445% among most experts, with a minority putting the chance modestly above even odds (58% and 63%), citing historical inertia and the possibility that institutional adaptation plus denominator shrinkage may narrowly keep the rate just above the line. Those more pessimistic (35\u201340% range) emphasize the gravity and concentration of the 2025 negative shocks and the limits this year of even aggressive countermeasures.\n\nThere is broad agreement that never before in the decade since the bet was placed has the risk of a breach been so high, with the likelihood of Caplan losing now considered to be either slightly or substantially more likely than him winning, but with considerable uncertainty due to denominator effects (shrinking 18\u201324 population), lagging effects of returning/continuing students, and the impact of institutional responses.\n\nIn sum: Most forecasters assign a 30-45% probability that Caplan wins his bet (rate above 26.6%), with a minority estimating a 58-63% chance in his favor. All agree that 2025 brought an extraordinary international enrollment collapse and worsening domestic/demographic headwinds. While historical patterns suggest inertia would normally help Caplan, the confluence and scale of 2025\u2019s negative events have, in expert judgment, made a breach of the 26.6% threshold more likely than not for the first time.",
