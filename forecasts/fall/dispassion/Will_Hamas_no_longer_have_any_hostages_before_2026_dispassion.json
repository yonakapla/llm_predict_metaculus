While I expect some hostages to be released shortly, the chance that at least one will remain in Hamas custody\u2014due to breakdown in implementation, rogue elements, or logistical failure\u2014remains real.

As a result, at least one living hostage remains under Hamas control, or the process is delayed beyond January 1, 2026.",

However, the history of similar negotiations in this conflict and others (e.g., previous Israel-Hamas hostage exchanges, Taliban/Afghan government prisoner swaps, etc.) shows that last-minute breakdowns are common, especially when deals are highly sequenced and depend on reciprocal trust. The number of living hostages is now relatively low, which slightly increases the feasibility of a complete release. Nevertheless, the risk of spoilers, political backlash, or tactical holdouts by either side remains material. Given the high degree of external pressure and the fact that both parties have publicly committed to the deal, but also factoring in the numerous unresolved issues and a history of breakdowns at this stage, I assess the probability that Hamas will have no hostages at any point before January 1, 2026, at 70%.",

The main risks are last-minute breakdowns over sequencing, Israeli domestic opposition, or operational mishaps during transfer. The unresolved issues of disarmament and Gaza governance are more likely to disrupt subsequent phases than this immediate hostage release. Given the clarity of the phase-one commitment, the strong mediation presence, and the high stakes for both parties, I assess that the probability Hamas will have released all hostages before 2026 is high but not certain\u2014leaving a meaningful risk for sudden breakdowns, spoilers, or delays.

The agreement, announced by Trump, includes the release of all hostages\u2014alive and dead\u2014within 72 hours of Israeli government approval, and an Israeli military withdrawal to the so-called 'yellow line' in Gaza, with the pullback expected to take under 24 hours after approval. A senior Israeli security source confirmed the yellow line as the initial withdrawal boundary. Hamas confirmed its acceptance of the ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange but demanded guarantees that Israel fully implements the deal. The White House stated that hostage releases would begin on Monday, following approval by Israel\u2019s government, which Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said would convene on Thursday. Of the 48 hostages, 20 are still believed to be alive. Hamas has handed over lists of both hostages it holds and Palestinian prisoners it seeks in exchange, including high-profile figures such as Marwan al-Barghouti and Ahmed Saadat, both serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. Trump\u2019s plan envisions a postwar administration for Gaza led by a proposed 'Board of Peace' headed by Trump and including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, though Hamas rejects foreign oversight and insists governance be transferred only to a Palestinian technocrat government backed by Arab and Muslim nations. Key unresolved issues include the timing of the Israeli withdrawal, the fate of Hamas, the mechanism for ensuring a complete pullout, and the long-term political future of Gaza. Arab states support the plan as a path to Palestinian statehood, a prospect Netanyahu has ruled out. Israel has reduced military operations in Gaza at Trump\u2019s request but has not halted strikes entirely. The next phase of the plan requires international oversight, but Hamas has refused to discuss disarming while Israeli forces remain on Palestinian land. Trump is expected to travel to Egypt in the coming days and has accepted Netanyahu\u2019s invitation to address Israel\u2019s parliament.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 05:37 AM\nSource:[The Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2025/10/09/qa-what-do-we-know-about-trumps-gaza-deal/)\n\n**Israel, Hamas agree to 'first phase' of plan to end fighting, release hostages, Trump says**\nOn October 8, 2025, Israel and Hamas agreed to a 'first phase' of a deal brokered by the Trump administration to pause fighting in Gaza, release at least some hostages, and begin troop withdrawals. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that all 20 remaining living hostages would be released soon, and Israel would withdraw troops to an agreed-upon line, calling it a step toward a 'Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.' Israel and Hamas separately confirmed the agreement, with Hamas demanding a lasting ceasefire and guarantees before releasing hostages, while Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would convene his government to approve the deal. The plan, unveiled by the Trump administration, calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of 48 hostages (with 20 still believed alive), the disarmament of Hamas (a contentious point), the transfer of power to apolitical technocrats under international supervision (led by Trump and former UK PM Tony Blair), and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 250 serving life sentences. The negotiations, held in Egypt and attended by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Netanyahu\u2019s adviser Ron Dermer, marked a breakthrough after months of deadlock. The deal follows two previous ceasefires that collapsed\u2014November 2023 (100+ hostages released) and January\u2013February 2025 (25 hostages and 8 bodies released). Despite optimism from displaced Palestinians like Sara Rihan and families of hostages, such as Matan Angrest and Einav Zangauker, who cried tears of joy, serious unresolved issues remain, including Hamas\u2019 disarmament and Gaza\u2019s future governance. The U.S. State Department noted progress via a note from Marco Rubio urging Trump to announce the deal on Truth Social. The war, which began on October 7, 2023, has killed over 67,000 Palestinians (half reportedly women and children) and injured nearly 170,000, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government. The UN and independent experts consider these figures the most reliable. International experts, including those for a U.N. body, have alleged Israel\u2019s offensive constitutes genocide\u2014a claim Israel denies. The situation remains fragile, with deep divisions and unresolved core issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[WLNS 6 Lansing](https://www.wlns.com/top-stories/israel-hamas-agree-to-first-phase-of-plan-to-end-fighting-release-hostages-trump-says/)\n\n**Trump says Israel, Hamas agree to 'first phase' of plan to end fighting, release hostages**\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on October 8, 2025, that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the 'first phase' of his peace plan, which includes a pause in fighting and the release of at least some hostages and prisoners. Trump stated that all hostages would be released soon and Israel would withdraw troops to an agreed line, marking the first steps toward a 'Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.' He indicated he may travel to the Middle East by Sunday, citing that negotiations are progressing well. A note passed from Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Trump, referencing approval of a Truth Social post to announce the deal, underscored the administration\u2019s urgency to claim credit. Key figures present at the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, included Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Israeli adviser Ron Dermer, and Hamas negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. Hamas is demanding firm guarantees that Israel will not resume military operations after the hostage release, while Israel insists on Hamas disarming. The plan also calls for an international security force to govern Gaza post-war, with Trump and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing reconstruction. While progress was reported on prisoner lists and ceasefire guarantees, key issues remain unresolved, including disarmament, troop withdrawal timing, and governance. A Palestinian official confirmed that Hamas would release all living hostages but delay returning remains until conditions allow. The deadline for a final deal is set for Friday. Egypt\u2019s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi called the talks 'very encouraging.' Israel has accepted the plan, and Hamas reiterated demands for a lasting ceasefire and full withdrawal, though it opposes disarmament and international rule. The conflict, which began with a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has killed over 67,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 170,000, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. The UN and independent experts consider these figures reliable. Displaced Palestinians, including Sara Rihan from Jabaliya, expressed hope for a return to their homes despite widespread destruction. The Trump plan aims to resolve all outstanding issues simultaneously, building on a failed January ceasefire. Past negotiations collapsed when Israel resumed military action in March, citing pressure for hostage releases. The U.S. and international experts have raised concerns about Israel\u2019s conduct, with some labeling it genocide\u2014an accusation Israel denies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[WESH](https://www.wesh.com/article/trump-israel-hamas-agree-first-phase-to-end-fighting-release-hostages/68957248)\n\n**A fractured peace: Trump demands Israeli ceasefire as Hamas accepts key terms of hostage deal   - NaturalNews.com**\nOn October 8, 2025, President Donald J. Trump called for an immediate Israeli ceasefire in Gaza following Hamas's conditional acceptance of his 20-point peace plan. Hamas agreed in principle to release all remaining Israeli hostages\u2014both living and deceased\u2014and transfer administrative control of the Gaza Strip to a technocratic Palestinian body backed by Arab and Islamic consensus, marking a significant shift from its prior stance. However, Hamas did not commit to full disarmament, insisting it would only occur after a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and demanded inclusion in any future national dialogue on Palestinian governance\u2014a direct challenge to the U.S. demand that Hamas have no political role. Trump, interpreting the move as a genuine step toward peace, publicly pressured Israel via Truth Social to halt bombing, emphasizing that continued military action would jeopardize hostage extraction. Israel\u2019s response, through Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office, confirmed readiness to implement the hostage release phase but omitted any mention of stopping the bombing, highlighting internal political constraints. The plan includes a large-scale prisoner exchange\u2014approximately 2,000 Palestinian detainees released from Israeli jails in return for hostages\u2014underscoring the humanitarian and symbolic weight of the deal. The international community, including the UK, France, Germany, Qatar, Egypt, and the UN, welcomed the development and urged swift implementation. The conflict, triggered by the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted over 250, has resulted in over 66,000 Palestinian deaths according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry, with famine conditions reported. This moment represents a high-stakes diplomatic opportunity for the Trump administration, testing its doctrine of high-risk, high-reward negotiation. As Brighteon.AI\u2019s Enoch stated, 'The war in Gaza is likely to end through a negotiated ceasefire with Hamas, not a unilateral Israeli victory.' The success of the ceasefire hinges on Israel\u2019s willingness to cease military operations and Hamas\u2019s full disarmament\u2014two conditions still unresolved. For civilians in Gaza and hostage families, the outcome of this fragile window could define the region\u2019s future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-10-07-trump-demands-israeli-ceasefire-hamas-accepts-terms.html)\n\n**Trump Announces Israel and Hamas Agree on First Phase of Gaza Ceasefire, Hostage Release**\nOn October 9, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage release deal under his 20-point peace plan, marking a significant development in the war in Gaza that has killed over 67,000 people since October 7, 2023. The agreement, reached during indirect talks in Egypt, includes the release of all hostages and an Israeli troop withdrawal to an agreed-upon line. Trump stated on Truth Social that 'ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon' and that the deal would pave the way for a 'Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the deal would be presented to his government for approval, calling it a 'diplomatic success and a national and moral victory.' Hamas confirmed its acceptance, stating the deal includes an Israeli withdrawal and a hostage-prisoner exchange, while affirming its commitment to Palestinian national rights. Hostage families in Tel Aviv celebrated, with one parent saying, 'Our children will not have returned home without him.' Hamas sources said living hostages would be handed over within 72 hours of Israeli approval, though recovery of dead hostages\u2014estimated at 28\u2014would take longer. The Israeli military warned that parts of Gaza remain dangerous, with combat zones still encircling Gaza City. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged full compliance and immediate humanitarian access. The plan\u2019s next phase involves an international body led by Trump and including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair to oversee post-war governance in Gaza, but Arab nations insist this must lead to Palestinian statehood, a demand Netanyahu rejects. Hamas opposes foreign oversight, insisting only a Palestinian technocrat government under Arab and Muslim backing would be acceptable. Critics, including the Atlantic Council\u2019s Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, argue the war is 'far from over' and that key issues like Gaza\u2019s future governance remain unresolved. Oil prices dropped as the ceasefire reduced fears of regional supply disruption. Despite global celebrations, concerns remain over the lack of detail, the unresolved fate of Hamas, and the risk of collapse\u2014similar to past failed efforts. Multiple rights experts and a UN inquiry have accused Israel of genocide, which Israel denies, calling its actions self-defense.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Asharq Al-Awsat](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5195301)\n\n**Trump Announces Key Peace Agreement Between Israel and Hamas**\nOn October 9, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of his peace plan, which includes the release of all hostages held in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to a previously agreed line within Gaza. Trump stated, 'I am very proud to announce that both Israel and Hamas have approved the first phase of our peace plan,' adding that 'ALL hostages will be released very soon,' and that Israel would withdraw its forces as a step toward 'a strong, lasting, and eternal peace.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded positively, saying he would convene his government to approve the agreement, while Hamas declared the pact would 'end the war' and urged Trump to ensure Israel fulfills its commitments. The agreement, which follows two years of war, is set to be signed in Egypt, with Trump planning to travel this weekend. A dramatic moment occurred when U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupted a White House event to deliver a handwritten note stating the deal was 'very close' and urging Trump to announce it quickly. The plan includes 20 points, such as a ceasefire, gradual Israeli troop withdrawal, Hamas disarmament, and humanitarian aid access to Gaza. Hamas has agreed to release hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with negotiations involving delegations from the Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (FPLP). U.S., Qatari, and Turkish officials, along with Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, participated. Previous truces in November 2023 and early 2025 had facilitated hostage and body returns. Hamas accepted the release of hostages but demanded a complete Israeli withdrawal and did not commit to disarmament. Netanyahu supported the plan but insisted Israeli forces remain in most of Gaza and reiterated the need to disarm Hamas. Meanwhile, Israeli far-right minister Itamar Ben Gvir visited the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, provoking backlash from Hamas and Arab nations. Ben Gvir stated, 'I only pray that our Prime Minister allows a total victory in Gaza, to destroy Hamas, with God\u2019s help, and bring back the hostages.' The October 7, 2023 Hamas attack killed 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to official data. Israel\u2019s military response caused widespread devastation, resulting in over 67,100 deaths in Gaza, primarily civilians, per the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The UN declared famine in parts of Gaza, and independent UN investigators allege Israel is committing 'genocide,' a claim rejected by Israeli leadership.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 06:31 AM\nSource:[Diario El D\u00eda                     ](https://www.eldia.com/nota/2025-10-9-3-22-59-un-acuerdo-por-la-paz-israel-y-hamas-dieron-un-paso-clave-el-mundo)\n\n**Q&A: What do we know about Trump's Gaza deal?**\nOn October 9, 2025, Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of former U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, following indirect talks in Egypt. The agreement, announced by Trump, includes the release of all hostages\u2014alive and dead\u2014within 72 hours of Israeli government approval, and an Israeli military withdrawal to the so-called 'yellow line' in Gaza, with the pullback expected to take under 24 hours after approval. A senior Israeli security source confirmed the yellow line as the initial withdrawal boundary. Hamas confirmed its acceptance of the ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange but demanded guarantees that Israel fully implements the deal. The White House stated that hostage releases would begin on Monday, following approval by Israel\u2019s government, which Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said would convene on Thursday. Of the 48 hostages, 20 are still believed to be alive. Hamas has handed over lists of both hostages it holds and Palestinian prisoners it seeks in exchange, including high-profile figures such as Marwan al-Barghouti and Ahmed Saadat, both serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. Trump\u2019s plan envisions a postwar administration for Gaza led by a proposed 'Board of Peace' headed by Trump and including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, though Hamas rejects foreign oversight and insists governance be transferred only to a Palestinian technocrat government backed by Arab and Muslim nations. Key unresolved issues include the timing of the Israeli withdrawal, the fate of Hamas, the mechanism for ensuring a complete pullout, and the long-term political future of Gaza. Arab states support the plan as a path to Palestinian statehood, a prospect Netanyahu has ruled out. Israel has reduced military operations in Gaza at Trump\u2019s request but has not halted strikes entirely. The next phase of the plan requires international oversight, but Hamas has refused to discuss disarming while Israeli forces remain on Palestinian land. Trump is expected to travel to Egypt in the coming days and has accepted Netanyahu\u2019s invitation to address Israel\u2019s parliament.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 05:37 AM\nSource:[The Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2025/10/09/qa-what-do-we-know-about-trumps-gaza-deal/)\n\n**Trump: Israel and Hamas Agree on First Phase of Peace Plan, All Hostages to Be Released, Israeli Forces to Withdraw from Gaza**\nOn October 4, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of his proposed Gaza peace plan, marking a potential turning point after nearly two years of war. Under the agreement, Hamas will release all 48 remaining hostages\u2014including 20 survivors and several bodies\u2014while Israel will withdraw its military from the Gaza Strip to a mutually recognized line. Trump stated, 'I am proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of my peace plan. This means all hostages will soon be released, and Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza, marking the first step toward a strong, lasting, and sustainable peace.' U.S. Secretary of State Rubio reportedly handed Trump a note during a White House meeting urging him to post the announcement promptly to claim credit for the breakthrough. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu responded briefly: 'With God\u2019s help, we will bring them all home.' Negotiations took place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, with U.S. envoys Richard Verter and Jared Kushner involved, supported by Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey as mediators. Representatives from the Palestinian Popular Front and Islamic Jihad also participated, indicating an attempt to include all Palestinian factions. The first phase requires Hamas to release all hostages and, after disarming, allows for a phased Israeli withdrawal. Gaza would then be handed over to an international security force, later transitioning to governance by a technocratic Palestinian body, with Trump and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing reconstruction and transitional governance. Egyptian President Sisi called the talks 'encouraging,' and the Israeli government expressed 'cautious optimism,' confirming acceptance of the core framework. Hamas reiterated demands for a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal, did not explicitly agree to disarmament or international governance, but stated it would not participate in future Gaza administration. Hamas chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya emphasized the need for Trump and mediators to guarantee the conflict would not resume, stating, 'We don\u2019t want to go back to the past.' U.S. officials noted Hamas has not yet agreed to immediate repatriation of deceased hostages, pending stabilization in Gaza. A list of Palestinian prisoners to be released is being finalized, with sources indicating the agreement must be confirmed by Friday, October 10, 2025, when Trump is expected to formally declare the end of the war. The conflict began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, triggering a massive Israeli military response. According to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, over 66,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli military operations. With Israeli ground forces intensifying their siege of Gaza City, international calls for a ceasefire have grown louder.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 12:37 AM\nSource:[\u661f\u5c9b\u73af\u7403\u7f51](https://www.stnn.cc/c/2025-10-09/4008108.shtml)\n\n**Israel, Hamas agree to 'first phase' of plan to end fighting, release hostages, Trump says**\nOn October 8, 2025, Israel and Hamas agreed to a 'first phase' of a deal brokered by the Trump administration to pause fighting in Gaza, release at least some hostages, and begin troop withdrawals. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that all 20 remaining living hostages would be released soon, and Israel would withdraw troops to an agreed-upon line, calling it a step toward a 'Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.' Israel and Hamas separately confirmed the agreement, with Hamas demanding a lasting ceasefire and guarantees before releasing hostages, while Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would convene his government to approve the deal. The plan, unveiled by the Trump administration, calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of 48 hostages (with 20 still believed alive), the disarmament of Hamas (a contentious point), the transfer of power to apolitical technocrats under international supervision (led by Trump and former UK PM Tony Blair), and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 250 serving life sentences. The negotiations, held in Egypt and attended by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Netanyahu\u2019s adviser Ron Dermer, marked a breakthrough after months of deadlock. The deal follows two previous ceasefires that collapsed\u2014November 2023 (100+ hostages released) and January\u2013February 2025 (25 hostages and 8 bodies released). Despite optimism from displaced Palestinians like Sara Rihan and families of hostages, such as Matan Angrest and Einav Zangauker, who cried tears of joy, serious unresolved issues remain, including Hamas\u2019 disarmament and Gaza\u2019s future governance. The U.S. State Department noted progress via a note from Marco Rubio urging Trump to announce the deal on Truth Social. The war, which began on October 7, 2023, has killed over 67,000 Palestinians (half reportedly women and children) and injured nearly 170,000, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government. The UN and independent experts consider these figures the most reliable. International experts, including those for a U.N. body, have alleged Israel\u2019s offensive constitutes genocide\u2014a claim Israel denies. The situation remains fragile, with deep divisions and unresolved core issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[WLNS 6 Lansing](https://www.wlns.com/top-stories/israel-hamas-agree-to-first-phase-of-plan-to-end-fighting-release-hostages-trump-says/)\n\n**Trump says Israel, Hamas agree to 'first phase' of plan to end fighting, release hostages**\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on October 8, 2025, that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the 'first phase' of his peace plan, which includes a pause in fighting and the release of at least some hostages and prisoners. Trump stated that all hostages would be released soon and Israel would withdraw troops to an agreed line, marking the first steps toward a 'Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.' He indicated he may travel to the Middle East by Sunday, citing that negotiations are progressing well. A note passed from Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Trump, referencing approval of a Truth Social post to announce the deal, underscored the administration\u2019s urgency to claim credit. Key figures present at the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, included Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Israeli adviser Ron Dermer, and Hamas negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. Hamas is demanding firm guarantees that Israel will not resume military operations after the hostage release, while Israel insists on Hamas disarming. The plan also calls for an international security force to govern Gaza post-war, with Trump and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing reconstruction. While progress was reported on prisoner lists and ceasefire guarantees, key issues remain unresolved, including disarmament, troop withdrawal timing, and governance. A Palestinian official confirmed that Hamas would release all living hostages but delay returning remains until conditions allow. The deadline for a final deal is set for Friday. Egypt\u2019s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi called the talks 'very encouraging.' Israel has accepted the plan, and Hamas reiterated demands for a lasting ceasefire and full withdrawal, though it opposes disarmament and international rule. The conflict, which began with a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has killed over 67,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 170,000, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. The UN and independent experts consider these figures reliable. Displaced Palestinians, including Sara Rihan from Jabaliya, expressed hope for a return to their homes despite widespread destruction. The Trump plan aims to resolve all outstanding issues simultaneously, building on a failed January ceasefire. Past negotiations collapsed when Israel resumed military action in March, citing pressure for hostage releases. The U.S. and international experts have raised concerns about Israel\u2019s conduct, with some labeling it genocide\u2014an accusation Israel denies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[WESH](https://www.wesh.com/article/trump-israel-hamas-agree-first-phase-to-end-fighting-release-hostages/68957248)\n\n**Trump says Gaza peace deal 'very close' and he may travel to Middle East in days**\nU.S. President Donald Trump stated on October 8, 2025, that negotiations in Egypt to end the two-year war in Gaza are 'very close' to a deal and that he may travel to the Middle East on Saturday or Sunday. Senior officials\u2014including U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner (Trump\u2019s son-in-law), Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Turkey\u2019s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin\u2014attended the third day of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas. The U.S. and its Arab allies, including Qatar and Turkey, are supporting the effort to secure a truce. Hamas has agreed to three components of Trump\u2019s 20-point plan: releasing all 48 Israeli hostages (20 believed alive), surrendering governance of Gaza, and Israel\u2019s withdrawal to a buffer zone. However, key issues remain unresolved, including Hamas\u2019s disarmament, the timing and process of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the structure of an international technocratic body to govern Gaza. Logistics for a hostage-prisoner swap are still being worked out, with Hamas providing a list of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners to be released. Israeli right-wing figures, including Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, oppose prisoner releases and demand 'complete victory' over Hamas, while Hamas views Ben-Gvir\u2019s visit to al-Aqsa Mosque as a provocation. Israel has continued military operations in Gaza during talks, killing at least 10 people in the past 24 hours, according to the Gaza health authority. Over the past two years, at least 67,183 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 170,000 injured. Israel initiated the war after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages on October 7, 2023. The Trump administration\u2019s plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, hostage release, Hamas disarmament, and a phased Israeli withdrawal in exchange for the release of Palestinian detainees. Humanitarian aid and reconstruction funding are also part of the proposal. A parallel ministerial meeting in Paris, led by France and including Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and others, is discussing the international stabilization force, disarmament, aid, and reconstruction\u2014though Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar criticized the meeting for excluding Israel. Trump has threatened Hamas with 'total obliteration' if it does not accept the deal. Both Israel and Hamas claim to be committed to a successful outcome, but their public statements reveal conflicting long-term visions: Netanyahu has stated Israel will remain in Gaza, while Hamas has not mentioned disarmament in official statements and some officials reject full disarmament in interviews.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 09:42 PM\nSource:[The Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2025/10/08/trump-says-gaza-peace-deal-very-close-and-he-may-travel-to-middle-east-in-days/)\n\n**Israeli Government, Hamas agree to 'first phase' of ceasefire plan, hostage release**\nOn October 8, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the 'first phase' of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire plan, which includes an immediate pause in hostilities, the release of at least some hostages, and a potential Israeli troop withdrawal to an agreed-upon line. Trump stated that all hostages would be released soon and emphasized that 'negotiations are going along very well,' with a possible announcement of a deal via Truth Social. The talks, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, involved U.S. officials including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s adviser Ron Dermer, and Hamas negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. Hamas seeks firm guarantees that Israel will not resume military operations after the hostage release and has postponed returning the remains of deceased hostages until conditions in Gaza allow. Key unresolved issues include Hamas disarmament, the timing and extent of Israeli withdrawal, and the creation of an international governing body for Gaza under the oversight of Trump and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Trump plan also calls for a major reconstruction campaign. While Netanyahu has accepted the plan and Hamas has reiterated its demand for a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal, it has not committed to disarmament or international governance. Progress was reported on the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released and on assurances of no renewed fighting. A Palestinian official confirmed that mediators have set a deadline of Friday for a final agreement, with Trump expected to declare the end of the war upon its conclusion.

The United Nations and independent experts consider these figures the most reliable. Displaced Palestinians, including Sara Rihan from Jabaliya, continue to live in makeshift shelters along Gaza\u2019s coast, praying for peace and a return to their homes.

Trump called for an immediate Israeli ceasefire in Gaza following Hamas's conditional acceptance of his 20-point peace plan. Hamas agreed in principle to release all remaining Israeli hostages\u2014both living and deceased\u2014and transfer administrative control of the Gaza Strip to a technocratic Palestinian body backed by Arab and Islamic consensus, marking a significant shift from its prior stance. However, Hamas did not commit to full disarmament, insisting it would only occur after a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and demanded inclusion in any future national dialogue on Palestinian governance\u2014a direct challenge to the U.S. demand that Hamas have no political role. Trump, interpreting the move as a genuine step toward peace, publicly pressured Israel via Truth Social to halt bombing, emphasizing that continued military action would jeopardize hostage extraction. Israel\u2019s response, through Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office, confirmed readiness to implement the hostage release phase but omitted any mention of stopping the bombing, highlighting internal political constraints. The plan includes a large-scale prisoner exchange\u2014approximately 2,000 Palestinian detainees released from Israeli jails in return for hostages\u2014underscoring the humanitarian and symbolic weight of the deal. The international community, including the UK, France, Germany, Qatar, Egypt, and the UN, welcomed the development and urged swift implementation. The conflict, triggered by the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted over 250, has resulted in over 66,000 Palestinian deaths according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry, with famine conditions reported. This moment represents a high-stakes diplomatic opportunity for the Trump administration, testing its doctrine of high-risk, high-reward negotiation. As Brighteon.AI\u2019s Enoch stated, 'The war in Gaza is likely to end through a negotiated ceasefire with Hamas, not a unilateral Israeli victory.' The success of the ceasefire hinges on Israel\u2019s willingness to cease military operations and Hamas\u2019s full disarmament\u2014two conditions still unresolved. For civilians in Gaza and hostage families, the outcome of this fragile window could define the region\u2019s future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-10-07-trump-demands-israeli-ceasefire-hamas-accepts-terms.html)\n\n**Trump Urges Rapid Action Ahead of Key Gaza Peace Talks, Amid Ongoing Airstrikes and Shifting Hamas Stance**\nOn October 5, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump urged all parties involved in the indirect peace negotiations between Hamas and Israel over the conflict in the Gaza Strip to act 'quickly,' ahead of the talks scheduled to begin in Egypt on October 6. The negotiations follow Hamas's partial acceptance of a 20-point peace proposal put forward by the U.S., which includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages\u201465 of whom are believed to be alive\u2014and governance of Gaza by technocrats, though Hamas did not address Israel\u2019s demand for disarmament or commit to future governance. Trump stated on social media that the talks were 'going quite well' and expected the first phase to conclude by the end of the week, emphasizing the urgency: 'Time is critical; otherwise, a great deal of blood will be spilled.' He claimed that the U.S. was not required to be flexible, as near-consensus already existed, and described the deal as 'a great transaction' for Israel, Arab nations, and the world. Despite Trump\u2019s assertion that Israel had agreed to halt airstrikes, Israeli military operations continued: Israeli officials confirmed that while operations within Gaza had paused, a ceasefire had not yet been established. The Israeli Defense Forces were instructed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to respond militarily if lives were at risk. BBC reports from Gaza indicate that Israeli airstrikes and tank shelling continued from the night of October 4 to 5, destroying multiple apartment buildings in Gaza City. BBC correspondent in southern Israel reported hearing explosions and seeing smoke from Gaza early on October 5. According to Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, 65 people were killed in Israeli attacks between October 5 at noon and the previous 24 hours. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS\u2019s 'Face the Nation' that halting airstrikes was essential to facilitate hostage releases, stating, 'We cannot release hostages while bombing continues. It must stop, but other coordination must also move forward.' The U.S.-proposed 20-point plan includes an immediate halt to fighting in Gaza, the release of 48 remaining hostages (20 of whom are believed to be alive) in exchange for Israel releasing hundreds of Gaza detainees. Netanyahu stated on October 4 that he hoped to announce the release of hostages 'soon.' According to spokesperson Shosh Bederosian, Netanyahu had clearly instructed that the negotiation period be limited to a few days under the Trump administration\u2019s agreement. Israel has dispatched its delegation to Egypt for the talks, while a Hamas delegation led by negotiator Khalil al-Hayya arrived in Cairo on the evening of October 5. Al-Hayya, who was targeted in a previous Israeli strike in Doha, Qatar, is a key figure. The U.S. delegation includes Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Qatar\u2019s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will also attend. This is considered one of the most significant moments since the war began, with hopes that a realistic path to ceasefire may finally emerge. Trump\u2019s peace plan has seen recent shifts: Hamas, previously rejecting the proposal or demanding tough conditions, unexpectedly accepted part of it. Notably, Hamas did not include its traditional 'red lines'\u2014such as retaining power in Gaza\u2014in its official statement, a move interpreted by many as a sign of external pressure. Palestinian officials told BBC that mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey played a key role in persuading Hamas to adopt a more conciliatory stance, including deferring disputes over weapons and post-war governance to the negotiation table. However, many Gaza residents warn that this tactical flexibility carries significant risks: every day of delay increases casualties, destruction, and displacement of tens of thousands. Still, Hamas\u2019s decision to enter negotiations without clear preconditions may indicate an acknowledgment of its limited influence after nearly two years of war. When asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper whether Hamas would face 'complete annihilation' if it claimed control over Gaza, Trump replied via text: 'Hamas will face complete annihilation.' Trump also claimed on his social media platform 'Truth Social' that Israel had agreed to initial withdrawal lines from Gaza, which are part of the U.S.-proposed phased withdrawal map. According to population data, the proposed withdrawal lines\u2014covering southern Rafah, northern Beit Hanun and Beit Lahia, about a quarter of Gaza City, and half of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah\u2014would prevent approximately 900,000 Palestinians from returning to their homes. Hamas previously rejected similar maps in March and May. Hamas led the October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. According to Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, at least 67,139 people have been killed since Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive began. Since the war\u2019s start, Israel has denied independent reporting access to international media like BBC, making it difficult to verify claims from both sides. As negotiators prepare in Egypt, people across the Middle East are watching closely. Despite deep mistrust and political fragility, there is growing hope that these talks may finally open a path to a ceasefire.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 02:08 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/7ba14ef0bd6cc38b830e56df7f0a784a1838f0a3)\n\n**Hamas Accepts Trump\u2019s Hostage Release Plan, But Demands Negotiations on Key Terms**\nThe Palestinian Islamist group Hamas announced its acceptance of U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to release hostages held in the Gaza Strip, contingent on favorable on-the-ground conditions and the liberation of all hostages\u2014living and deceased. However, Hamas did not fully endorse Trump\u2019s peace plan, instead calling for immediate negotiations through mediators to discuss key details. Hamas agreed to a temporary technocratic government in Gaza but emphasized that broader issues\u2014including the future of Gaza and the 'inalienable rights' of the Palestinian people\u2014must be based on a unified national Palestinian stance grounded in international law. The plan includes an immediate ceasefire, progressive Israeli military withdrawal (without set timelines), the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, and humanitarian aid via the United Nations. It also calls for the complete disarmament of Hamas, its exclusion from governance, and the establishment of a transitional government of Palestinian technocrats and international experts under a 'Peace Board.' Trump stated that Hamas is ready for 'a lasting peace' and demanded an immediate halt to Israeli airstrikes to enable hostage releases. Israel confirmed it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan but did not acknowledge Hamas\u2019s request for further negotiations. Israeli media reported that the military shifted to 'defensive operations' in Gaza, halting efforts to take control of the city of Gaza, though attacks continued throughout the night, resulting in dozens of deaths, including children. A senior Israeli source described these actions as 'elimination of threats, maintaining lines, and necessary attacks.' Qatar and Egypt, alongside the U.S., are mediators. Both countries welcomed Hamas\u2019s announcement and expressed confidence that the declaration would lead all parties to assume the necessary responsibility to implement the plan. Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry said it has already begun working with partners to continue discussions. Israeli media reported that Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, is set to travel to the region\u2014specifically Egypt\u2014to participate in the upcoming talks. Trump had previously given Hamas until Sunday to respond, threatening 'hell never seen before' if the plan was rejected. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that if Hamas rejects the proposal, Israel will maintain the siege on Gaza 'until the job is done,' adding that this can be achieved 'peacefully or by force.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 09:17 PM\nSource:[Portafolio.co](https://www.portafolio.co/internacional/gaza-acuerdo-con-hamas-para-liberar-rehenes-anticipa-intensas-negociaciones-del-plan-de-paz-641436)\n\n**Trump Urges Hamas to Finalize Gaza Peace Deal or Risk Total Collapse**\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on October 4, 2025, that Israel had temporarily suspended airstrikes in the Gaza Strip and urged Hamas to swiftly reach a final agreement, warning that failure to act would result in total collapse of the peace process. In a post on Truth Social, Trump expressed gratitude for Israel\u2019s pause in bombing, framing it as an opportunity to complete hostage releases and a peace accord. He emphasized that delays or renewed threats to Gaza would not be tolerated, stating, 'Let\u2019s finish quickly. Everyone will be treated fairly!' Hamas had partially accepted Trump\u2019s peace proposal on October 3, agreeing to release all hostages and transfer Gaza\u2019s administration to an independent Palestinian body composed of experts and technocrats. However, Hamas did not clarify its position on post-war governance or disarmament. Trump had previously issued a ultimatum, demanding that a deal be finalized by 6 p.m. Washington, D.C. time on Sunday, October 5, 2025, threatening to 'show them hell' if no agreement was reached. This proposal, unveiled on September 29, 2025, included 20 key points such as immediate ceasefire, full hostage release, Hamas disarmament, a peace committee chaired by Trump, phased Israeli withdrawal, and deployment of an International Stability Force (ISF).\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 05:37 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20251005_0003355700)\n\n**Trump Says 'No Tolerance for Delays' from Hamas on Gaza Peace Deal - BBC News Brasil**\nU.S. President Donald Trump stated on October 4, 2025, that he 'will not tolerate delays' in negotiations over his government's ceasefire proposal for Gaza, warning the Hamas leadership that 'all bets will be off' if they do not act quickly. In a post on Truth Social, Trump emphasized that he would not accept any outcome in which Gaza poses a threat again, urging swift action and justice for all. He praised Israel for temporarily halting airstrikes to allow progress on hostage release and peace talks. The announcement follows three Israeli air strikes on Gaza on the same day, which killed 66 people, raising the death toll since the war began to 67,074, with 265 others injured. Trump unveiled his 20-point peace plan on September 29, 2025, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who endorsed it. On October 3, Trump gave Hamas until October 5 to accept the plan or face 'hell.' Hamas responded by partially accepting the proposal, agreeing to release Israeli hostages\u2014living and deceased\u2014according to Trump\u2019s exchange formula, but seeking further negotiations on key issues including Gaza\u2019s future governance and Palestinian rights. The group stated it supports transferring Gaza\u2019s administration to a body of independent technocrats based on national consensus and Arab/Islamic support, but did not explicitly accept the plan\u2019s central demand: Hamas\u2019s disarmament and exclusion from governance. The U.S. proposal calls for an immediate end to hostilities, the release of 20 living hostages within 72 hours, and the return of remains of deceased hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians detained by Israel. It also mandates no role for Hamas in Gaza\u2019s governance and leaves room for a future Palestinian state. However, Netanyahu has long opposed a Palestinian state. After Hamas\u2019s partial response, Trump urged Israel to halt bombing Gaza, stating he believes Hamas is ready for a lasting peace. Yet, on October 4, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that northern Wadi Gaza remains a dangerous combat zone and warned Palestinians not to return, citing extreme danger. The IDF continues to surround Gaza City, the last Hamas stronghold, and has ordered evacuations to southern Gaza, where humanitarian groups report severe overcrowding.

The group endorsed the idea of a technocratic government administering Gaza but insisted that broader issues\u2014such as Gaza\u2019s future and the 'inalienable rights' of the Palestinian people\u2014must be addressed within a unified national Palestinian framework grounded in international law. Hamas also demanded an active and responsible role in a comprehensive national framework. Trump\u2019s plan includes an immediate ceasefire, gradual Israeli military withdrawal (without set timelines), the release of all hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, humanitarian aid delivery via the UN, the complete disarmament of Hamas, exclusion of Hamas from governance, and the establishment of a transitional government of Palestinian technocrats and international experts under a 'Peace Board.' U.S. President Trump declared Hamas ready for 'a lasting peace' and demanded an immediate halt to Israeli airstrikes. Israel stated it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan immediately but did not acknowledge Hamas\u2019s call for negotiations on specific elements. Israeli military actions shifted to 'defensive operations' in Gaza, halting efforts to take control of the city of Gaza, though attacks across the Strip continued, resulting in dozens of deaths, including children. Israeli sources described these actions as targeted 'elimination of threats, maintaining lines, and necessary attacks.' Qatar and Egypt are the primary mediators alongside the United States. Both countries welcomed Hamas\u2019s announcement and expressed confidence it would lead to shared responsibility in implementing the plan. Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al Ansari, confirmed that Qatar has begun working with partners to continue discussions. Israeli media reported that Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, will travel to the region\u2014specifically to Egypt\u2014to participate in the upcoming talks. If the plan fails, Trump warned Hamas that failure to accept by October 5, 2025, would trigger 'a hell like never seen before' against the group. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that if Hamas rejects the proposal, Israel will maintain the siege on Gaza 'until the job is done,' whether through peaceful or forceful means.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 01:41 PM\nSource:[albertonews.com](https://albertonews.com/internacionales/el-acuerdo-de-hamas-para-liberar-a-los-rehenes-anticipa-una-negociacion-intensa/)\n\n**Hamas agrees to release hostages after Trump's ultimatum**\nHamas announced on October 3, 2025, that it agrees to release all hostages held since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in accordance with U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan. The group accepted key provisions, including transferring administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of independents based on national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing. Hamas also committed to handing over the bodies of deceased hostages and initiating negotiations through mediators to finalize the exchange. However, it stated that other elements\u2014particularly those concerning Gaza\u2019s future governance and Palestinian rights\u2014require further consultation within a unified national framework, including Hamas\u2019s own participation. Trump responded on Truth Social, claiming Hamas\u2019s acceptance signals readiness for lasting peace and demanding Israel halt bombing in Gaza to ensure safe hostage release. He issued a stark ultimatum, threatening 'all hell' if the deal is not accepted by Sunday, citing the deaths of over 25,000 Hamas fighters and vowing to eliminate the remainder. Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and leaders across the Middle East and Europe have expressed support for the plan. The proposal includes Israel\u2019s withdrawal to agreed lines, a suspension of military operations, the release of 250 life-sentenced prisoners and 1,700 detained Gazans, and a commitment that Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. The plan also outlines deradicalization of Gaza, full aid delivery post-conflict, and a pathway to Palestinian self-determination after reforms. Sen. Lindsey Graham criticized Hamas\u2019s response as a 'Yes, but' tactic, rejecting disarmament and insisting on Palestinian control, while Sen. John Fetterman praised Trump\u2019s plan as a positive step. The White House confirmed Trump is preparing a video statement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 11:03 PM\nSource:[Santa Clarita Valley Signal](https://signalscv.com/2025/10/hamas-agrees-to-release-hostages-after-trumps-ultimatum/)\n\n**Hamas accepts elements of the Gaza peace plan after Trump's ultimatum**\nOn October 3, 2025, Hamas announced partial acceptance of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to end the war in the Gaza Strip, agreeing to release all remaining hostages and transfer power to a politically independent Palestinian body, but stating that other elements\u2014particularly those concerning the future governance of Gaza and Palestinian rights\u2014require further consultation among Palestinian factions and must be based on international law. The announcement followed Trump\u2019s ultimatum demanding agreement by Sunday evening, October 5, 2025, at 6:00 PM Washington, DC time, threatening a 'greater military onslaught' if not met. Trump\u2019s plan, endorsed by Israel and welcomed internationally, calls for Hamas to immediately release 48 remaining hostages\u2014around 20 believed alive\u2014surrender power, and disarm in exchange for Israel halting its offensive, withdrawing from much of Gaza, releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, allowing humanitarian aid, and shelving plans to relocate Gaza\u2019s population. The territory would come under international governance led by Trump and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, with no provision for future reunification with the West Bank. Hamas did not mention disarmament in its statement, and senior official Mousa Abu Marzouk noted logistical challenges in releasing hostages within 72 hours and objections to the term 'terrorists' in the plan, as Hamas views itself as a national liberation movement. Israel has maintained a blockade on Gaza since March 2025, cutting off food, medicine, and goods for 2.5 months, and has destroyed large areas, displacing an estimated 400,000 people. U.N. spokesperson Olga Cherevko reported displaced families, including pregnant women and the elderly, stranded in Shifa Hospital\u2019s parking lot due to unaffordable relocation. Trump claimed Hamas fighters are 'surrounded and militarily trapped,' and threatened their 'quick extinction' if the deal fails. Despite heavy losses, Hamas retains influence in non-controlled areas and continues sporadic attacks. Israel insists Hamas must surrender and disarm before any hostage release, rejecting Hamas\u2019s demand for a lasting ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal. No immediate response was issued by the U.S. or Israel, which was closed for the Jewish Sabbath.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/10/03/hamas-accepts-elements-of-the-gaza-peace-plan-after-trump-s-ultimatum_6746072_4.html)\n\n**Hamas Accepts Key Elements of Trump's Gaza Peace Plan, Demands Further Talks**\nThe Hamas terrorist organization has accepted parts of U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan for ending the Gaza war, specifically agreeing to the release of all hostages\u2014both living and deceased\u2014according to a statement issued on Friday, October 3, 2025. Hamas declared its willingness to enter immediate negotiations via mediators to discuss details, while reaffirming its demand for the Gaza Strip to be administered by an independent technocratic Palestinian authority. The group also expressed appreciation for Arab, Islamic, and international efforts, including those of Trump. Trump had set a deadline of Sunday, October 5, 2025, for Hamas to accept the plan, which includes the release of remaining Israeli hostages, a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territory, the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 Gaza residents, the disarmament of Hamas, and the creation of an international stabilization force. A transitional government composed of non-political Palestinians and international experts would manage daily governance and humanitarian supply, supervised by a peace council led by Trump and including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. The plan stipulates that the war would end immediately if both sides agree. However, Hamas did not specify which aspects required further negotiation, and the White House issued no immediate response. Prior to the statement, Trump warned on Truth Social that failure to accept the plan would result in 'hell breaking loose' on Hamas, stating: 'If this LAST-CHANCE agreement is not used, hell will break loose on Hamas like no one has ever seen.' Meanwhile, in Gaza, the Hamas-controlled Civil Defense reported heavy artillery and aerial bombardment, resulting in 11 deaths across the Strip, including eight in Gaza City.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 08:42 PM\nSource:[newsORF.at](https://orf.at/stories/3407363/)\n\n**Hamas Says It Accepts Freeing All Hostages and Agrees to Trump's Gaza Peace Plan**\nThe Hamas terrorist group announced on Friday, October 3, 2025, that it is willing to release all hostages\u2014both alive and deceased\u2014in response to a peace plan presented by former U.S. President Donald Trump for ending the war in the Gaza Strip. In a statement released on Telegram and reported by Al Jazeera, Hamas stated it is 'ready to immediately enter negotiations through mediators to discuss the details of this agreement.' The group confirmed it would release hostages 'according to the swap formula outlined in President Trump\u2019s proposal, provided that the necessary field conditions for the exchange are secured.' Hamas also accepted transferring administration of the Gaza Strip to an independent Palestinian body composed of technocrats and backed by national consensus, as well as Arab and Islamic support\u2014elements included in the White House\u2019s plan. The statement emphasized that other issues in Trump\u2019s proposal, including the future of Gaza and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, are tied to a unified national position and international laws and resolutions, and would be addressed within a 'comprehensive Palestinian national framework' in which Hamas will participate responsibly. The announcement came hours after Trump issued a deadline, setting Sunday, October 5, 2025, at 18:00 in Washington (19:00 Bras\u00edlia) as the final time for Hamas to accept the deal. In a post on Truth Social, Trump warned: 'An agreement with Hamas must be reached by 6 PM. All countries agreed to the deal! If this last-chance agreement is not reached, hell will break loose, as no one has ever seen before, against Hamas.' The 20-point plan proposed by Trump includes an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, the establishment of a transitional government in Gaza supervised by Trump and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the demilitarization of the Strip, and the potential for future negotiations on a Palestinian state\u2014a proposal not yet accepted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 08:12 PM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/mundo/hamas-diz-que-aceita-libertar-todos-os-refens-e-concorda-com-plano-de-trump-para-gaza/)\n\n**Hamas agrees to release all Israeli hostages, pending conditions**\nHamas has agreed to release all Israeli hostages, alive or dead, and expressed willingness to negotiate through mediators on President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point peace plan for the Middle East, according to a statement released on October 3, 2025. The plan, unveiled by the White House, calls for an immediate end to Israel\u2019s military assault in Gaza upon agreement, with all hostages to be released within 72 hours. Hamas also affirmed its readiness to transfer administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats, based on national consensus and Arab and Islamic support. Trump and Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Netanyahu welcomed the response, with Trump urging an immediate halt to bombing in Gaza to ensure safe hostage release. The U.S. and several Arab nations, including Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Jordan, supported the initiative. The Palestinian Authority and Muslim powers praised the plan as sincere, while some European nations that previously recognized Palestinian statehood also expressed cautious optimism. However, key unresolved issues remain: Hamas did not address the requirement for demilitarization of Gaza under independent supervision, a central condition of the plan. A former Western diplomat warned that the deal could still collapse if Hamas fails to meet the timeframe for hostage release or accept disarmament. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the development, urging all parties to seize the opportunity to end the conflict. The announcement comes on the eve of the second anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks that killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostages. According to Gaza health officials, over 65,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war. The peace effort marks a potential foreign policy milestone for Trump\u2019s second term, though skepticism persists over whether the agreement will hold. Trump\u2019s team, led by ally Steve Witkoff, has been actively engaged in negotiations, and Trump credited regional allies for their role. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich described the plan as part of a broader vision for Middle East stability, comparing Trump\u2019s potential role to Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s diplomatic success in ending the Russo-Japanese War.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 03:10 PM\nSource:[nbcchicago.com](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/hamas-says-it-agrees-to-release-all-israeli-hostages-part-of-trumps-gaza-peace-plan/3833383/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across eight expert perspectives\u2014including Security Studies, Diplomacy, International Relations, Political Science, and Middle Eastern Studies\u2014there is a broad consensus that the probability Hamas will have no hostages before 2026 is significantly higher than it has been at any previous stage of the conflict, though not a near-certainty. Most experts assign probabilities ranging from 65% to 83%, with reasoning anchored in the extraordinary degree of international mediation, strong incentives for both sides (including immense US and Trump administration involvement), and the limited number of remaining living hostages. Key positive factors across analyses include: public acceptance of the deal by both Hamas and Israel, robust third-party guarantees, and severe costs for not following through. However, all experts also caution about major risks: the fragile history of similar ceasefire and hostage agreements (with past collapses at the implementation stage), the possibility of renewed violence or breakdown over the sequencing of concessions, internal political opposition on both sides, spoiler actions (by factions or external actors), and operational difficulties in Gaza. Negative base rates for full hostage release, persistent mistrust, and unresolved core issues (such as Hamas disarmament and future Gaza governance) are widely cited as factors lowering the probability of full success. While the experts describe plausible 'no' scenarios involving derailment due to breakdowns or spoilers, most agree that the current context\u2014unprecedented international alignment, clear public commitments, and logistical feasibility\u2014is unusually conducive to a complete hostage release before the deadline. In summary, the expert community predicts a moderately high likelihood (65\u201383%) that Hamas will no longer have any hostages under its control before January 1, 2026, with optimism tempered by the recurrent fragility of such complex, high-stakes agreements in this conflict.",
