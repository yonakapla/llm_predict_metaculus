Fateh's ability to expand and mobilize a sometimes low-propensity base remains an open question, especially with potential confusion or disillusionment. Still, 2021\u2019s progressive split is likely resolved in Fateh\u2019s favor, and the strong anti-incumbent sentiment may be decisive.

Frey, while an incumbent, is hampered by poor favorability and lacks overwhelming citywide enthusiasm. However, Fateh\u2019s sudden loss of formal DFL endorsement and establishment backlash creates a real, credible structural barrier. Historical base rate (60% for incumbents) is partially offset by the rare unity of progressives around Fateh in a ranked-choice system, and by Frey\u2019s visible vulnerabilities. Public polling is limited and not definitive, making polling-based modeling risky, but the few available data points suggest a more anti-incumbent environment than in past cycles. On balance, in view of Fateh's progressive momentum minus the endorsement setback and Minneapolis's unique electoral history, this is a high-uncertainty but narrowly Fateh-favored scenario.

The status quo (incumbent advantage and base rates) favors Frey, but this year\u2019s anti-incumbent/anti-establishment dynamic, plus RCV dynamics (especially with only two major contenders), strongly narrows the gap. Considering all these, especially the significant setback of endorsement loss but not a total collapse of Fateh\u2019s position, Fateh is a clear underdog but very much in contention.

However, the most compelling argument against my initial probability is the disproportionate vulnerability of progressive surges to process-related setbacks, which can blunt even well-mobilized base energy.

In particular, new analyses from polling and sociology perspectives foreground the degree to which progressive consolidation and unprecedented anti-incumbent sentiment can overpower traditional institutional inertia, especially given the incumbent's sharply negative ratings and no serious right-wing threat. Conversely, GOTV and machine theory caution that procedural chaos can be difficult for insurgents to overcome. In weighing these, I conclude I modestly overweighted institutional inertia in my Phase 1 forecast and should increase Fateh's probability by a few points, given that the current cycle exhibits unusually strong anti-incumbent mood and progressive unity, with the DFL chaos more a confusion than a fatal blow to the challenger. A revised estimate of 48% better captures the balanced but live possibility of an anti-incumbent breakthrough.",

The consensus highlights that while Fateh\u2019s progressive energy and Frey\u2019s unpopularity introduce major volatility, the organizational blow of losing the DFL endorsement and the persistently powerful status quo/organizational inertia in Minneapolis local politics also matter greatly. In particular, critiques of highly optimistic forecasts gave me greater confidence in my baseline rooted in incumbency advantage, and brought more attention to the risks tied to demobilization, confusion, or backlash after the endorsement controversy. Meanwhile, defenses of more moderate probabilities underscored a genuine uncertainty floor that makes an extreme outcome in either direction unwarranted. Consequently, I have only minorly updated my view: Fateh likely faces very slightly better odds than my initial estimate, mainly due to the apparent sustained anti-incumbent/progressive momentum, but the dramatic increase suggested by some remains underweighted by organizational challenges. Therefore, I revise upward\u2014slightly\u2014to 43%.",

While the national progressive surge, Fateh's energized base, Frey's deep unpopularity, and Minneapolis's openness to outsider candidates remain credible tailwinds for Fateh, the risk of progressive demobilization or confusion after the DFL endorsement was vacated is greater than I weighted in Phase 1. The sound critiques from forecasters in political campaign strategy and incumbency advantage highlight that organizational chaos can suppress turnout among low-propensity voters, and historical base rates for Minneapolis incumbents overcoming DFL chaos warrant extra caution. At the same time, defenses of more moderate probabilities validate the power of progressive consolidation.

Critiques of the more optimistic forecasts effectively reiterate my original caution regarding turnout volatility, institutional headwinds from the DFL endorsement debacle, and the nontrivial status quo bias\u2014particularly in urban contests where organizational confusion can depress outsider momentum. At the same time, defenses of the high-variance, progressive-upset argument are persuasive, especially highlighting that this cycle's anti-incumbent, left-unified environment warrants some upward adjustment from historic base rates. The repeated emphasis on Fateh's potential for strong in-group mobilization and a less splintered left underscores a real and present threat to Frey's incumbency, but also much risk of organizational shortfall. The consensus slightly favors a tighter race than my initial framing, with a few credible arguments for modestly increasing Fateh's chances based on both progressives' field strength and the depth of anti-incumbent sentiment.

Some forecasters (notably from campaign strategy and RCV analytics) argue convincingly that the loss of the DFL endorsement creates confusion among marginal progressive voters, a problem not easily offset by enthusiasm or national trends, and point to the stubbornness of incumbent advantage in local GOTV contexts. However, other voices from public opinion, urban governance, and social identity theory note that Frey's extreme unpopularity and the rare consolidation of progressives in a non-splintered field offer Fateh a genuine path\u2014if not dominance, then at least an edge above the historic base-rate for incumbent defeats. The median cluster of peer probabilities is just over 50%, and the defense of my own and similar moderate-upward-leaning assessments is strong. That said, the best critiques warn against overestimating the impact of current progressive enthusiasm given the real, practical, and psychological effects of organizational chaos.

The original question opened on 2025-07-24 15:40:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/38922). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nWashington Post (July 24, 2025): [Is a Mamdani repeat coming to the Midwest? A democratic socialist is getting a boost in Minnesota.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/is-a-mamdani-repeat-coming-to-the-midwest-a-democratic-socialist-is-getting-a-boost-in-minnesota/ar-AA1JcfEP)\n\n> The Democratic Party in Minneapolis over the weekend endorsed a democratic socialist over the two-term incumbent in the city\u2019s mayoral race, the latest indicator of increased momentum for the progressive left in local races across the country.\n\n> Delegates of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota\u2019s most populous city on Saturday threw their support behind state Sen. Omar Fateh, who defeated Mayor Jacob Frey, at the party\u2019s convention. The endorsement comes less than a month after Zohran Mamdani, also a democratic socialist and state lawmaker, won the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York.\n\n> The mayoral race is a ranked-choice election, like in New York, and the general election will take place in November when all candidates will compete on the same ballot regardless of party affiliation. A Democrat is expected to win the race, as Minneapolis is a heavily Democratic city that has been led by Democratic mayors for more than 47 years.\n\n> While several candidates are running, the DFL endorsement effectively pits a democratic socialist against a relatively more moderate Frey. The mayoral race is far from over, according to political observers \u2014 but the endorsement does boost Fateh\u2019s profile. It also represents a major win for liberals, and is likely to draw national attention and money on the race.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st Century, incumbent mayors of Minneapolis have been re-elected 60% of the time: in 2021, 2009, 2005. Conversely, they have lost 40% of the time: in 2017 (to the current mayor, Jacob Frey) and in 2001.&#x20;\n\nAt the time of this question, there has been little public polling in the race. A poll from May 2025 [found](https://www.mplsforthemany.com/polling) Mayor Frey with -21% net favorability, which is 20 points worse than in September 2021, when Frey won the final round by 12.5 points against a progressive field that was divided into two main contenders, as compared with one (Fateh) in the 2025 election.&#x20;\n\nMayor Frey is also appealing his loss of the\u00a0Minneapolis Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party\u2019s endorsement, according to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5412323-minneapolis-mayor-frey-appeal-endorsement/).&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38922,\"question_id\":38271}}`",

Kathy Hochul's 2026 re\u2011election campaign, even after Hochul publicly supported him in a New\u202fYork\u202fTimes op\u2011ed. Mamdani told reporters his focus is 'on November,' and said, 'I'm excited to have the governor's support,' without committing to reciprocation. Hochul's endorsement came while other top Democrats, such as Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, have withheld public backing. Mamdani\u2019s platform includes raising the minimum wage to $30, opening state\u2011run grocery stores, and taxing what he calls 'richer and whiter' neighborhoods, prompting business owners to voice concerns and some to consider leaving the city. He has also been criticized for not condemning anti\u2011police slogans like 'globalize the intifada' and the phrase 'From the river to the sea'; he now says he 'discourages' the use of the latter only after pressure from Jewish leaders. The article argues that Hochul\u2019s endorsement signals a shift in the Democratic Party toward the far left and warns that her gamble could cost her political capital.

The endorsement followed a meeting between Mamdani and billionaire former mayor Michael\u202fBloomberg, who did not endorse him but met with him, according to the article. Hochul\u2019s endorsement broke a pattern of stone\u2011walling by senior Democrats, including Senators Chuck\u202fSchumer and Kirsten\u202fGillibrand and House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries. Mamdani is the frontrunner in a four\u2011way November\u202f4 election that also includes former Governor Andrew\u202fCuomo (running as an independent), incumbent Mayor Eric\u202fAdams (also independent) and Republican Curtis\u202fSliwa. House members Pat\u202fRyan, Gerry\u202fNadler, Senator Chris\u202fVan\u202fHollen and Representative Jamie\u202fRaskin have publicly endorsed Mamdani. Trump reacted to the endorsement with a threat, saying, 'This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New\u202fYork City. How can such a thing happen? Washington will be watching this situation very closely. No reason to be sending good money after bad!' The article also notes that Hochul\u2019s op\u2011ed in the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes emphasized police resources, quoting her as saying, 'I urged him to ensure that there is strong leadership at the helm of the N.Y.P.D. -- and he agreed.' It further describes Hochul as a right\u2011wing figure who has opposed driver\u2019s licenses for immigrant workers and deployed National Guard troops in subways. The piece portrays Bloomberg\u2019s meeting as cordial but not an endorsement, and claims that Mamdani has agreed to abandon certain rhetoric and will accept police presence, while warning that Trump may deploy the National Guard in New\u202fYork\u202fCity. The article is heavily political and sensational in tone.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 03:13 AM\nSource:[World Socialist](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/09/16/nkjc-s16.html)\n\n**Mamdani declines to immediately back NY Gov. Kathy Hochul's reelection after she offers him coveted endorsement**\nDemocratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, declined to endorse Gov. Kathy Hochul for a second term after she endorsed him for mayor. He said, 'My focus is on November,' and added, 'And I'm excited to have the governor's support in that fight for November as we make it clear that we can put the days of City Hall and Albany being at war in the past.' Hochul, a moderate Democrat, had endorsed him after weeks of hesitation, a move that has pressured other New York Democrats to support him. Mamdani's decision comes as Hochul faces potential challenges from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in the 2026 Democratic primary and from Republican Elise Stefanik in the general election. In a New York Times op\u2011ed, Hochul wrote, 'I do not see eye to eye on everything' with him but will stand together against those who attempt to tear us apart.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 12:46 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mamdani-declines-immediately-back-ny-004600459.html)\n\n**The Democratic Party is in fits over Mamdani's bid for NYC mayor. Republicans are loving it**\nDemocratic Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized his party\u2019s leadership for not endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, calling the stance 'spineless' and urging Democrats to support him. Mamdani, a 33\u2011year\u2011old self\u2011described democratic socialist, has drawn support from progressives but has been distanced by moderate Democrats and party leaders. Republican figures, including former President Donald Trump, have seized on the split, labeling Mamdani a communist and threatening to withhold federal funds. Democratic leaders such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have declined to endorse him, citing strategic considerations. Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani, while other New York representatives have split, with Rep. Tom Suozzi refusing endorsement and Rep. Pat Ryan supporting him. The divide echoes the earlier rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has defended Mamdani. National progressive groups and figures like Joseph Geevarghese and Abdul El\u2011Sayed have expressed frustration at the establishment\u2019s silence. Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia have linked Mamdani to the Democratic brand in their campaigns. The controversy is seen as a test of the Democratic Party\u2019s unity heading into the 2026 midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 09:54 PM\nSource:[My Northwest](https://mynorthwest.com/national/the-democratic-party-is-in-fits-over-mamdanis-bid-for-nyc-mayor-republicans-are-loving-it/4132150)\n\n**Mamdani Apologizes for Anti\u2011Police Remarks, Faces Mixed Reactions**\nOn September 15, 2025, New\u202fYork City mayoral candidate Zohran\u202fMamdani publicly apologized for earlier remarks that criticized the NYPD as \"racist, anti\u2011gay, and a major threat to public safety,\" according to a report by Epoch Times journalist Wang\u202fLiefei. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, had long advocated for police budget cuts since the 2020 death of George\u202fFloyd. The shift in his stance followed the July\u202f28, 2025 shooting in Midtown Manhattan, where gunman Shane\u202fTamura fired nearly 50 rounds, killing five people, including a fallen officer\u2014 the deadliest mass shooting in the city in 25\u202fyears. The incident prompted mixed reactions: some politicians praised his acknowledgment of the limits of police\u2011budget cuts, while former Governor Gavin\u202fNewsom criticized the change as inconsistent. Police union leader Patrick\u202fHendry demanded more than a verbal apology, calling for concrete actions to improve officer pay and working conditions. Mamdani now faces dual pressure\u2014to appease the 30,000\u2011plus NYPD workforce and to retain progressive voters\u2019 trust. Meanwhile, Governor\u202fHoch expressed support, saying, 'He should apologize. I think this is an appropriate response. He acknowledges the mistake and works to earn officers\u2019 respect, and I appreciate that.' Hoch also formally endorsed Mamdani for mayor, marking a significant alliance between the party\u2019s moderate and progressive wings. The outcome of Mamdani\u2019s attempt to resolve the controversy will be a key test of his campaign\u2019s viability.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 02:27 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/9/17/n14596288.htm)\n\n**Could Zohran Mamdani Win New\u202fYork\u2019s 2025 Mayoral Election?**\nZohran Mamdani, a 33\u2011year\u2011old member of the New\u202fYork State Assembly, has become the unexpected front\u2011runner for the 2025 New\u202fYork City mayoral race.

Hochul's endorsement came while other top Democrats, such as Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, have withheld public backing. Mamdani\u2019s platform includes raising the minimum wage to $30, opening state\u2011run grocery stores, and taxing what he calls 'richer and whiter' neighborhoods, prompting business owners to voice concerns and some to consider leaving the city. He has also been criticized for not condemning anti\u2011police slogans like 'globalize the intifada' and the phrase 'From the river to the sea'; he now says he 'discourages' the use of the latter only after pressure from Jewish leaders. The article argues that Hochul\u2019s endorsement signals a shift in the Democratic Party toward the far left and warns that her gamble could cost her political capital.

Kathy Hochul\u2019s endorsement of him in the November mayoral race, saying his focus was on the November election. Hochul had endorsed him on Sunday, but Mamdani said 'My focus is on November, and I'm excited to have the governor's support in that fight for November.' The move drew criticism from Rep. Elise Stefanik, who tweeted 'Even Mamdani refuses to support Kathy Hochul less than 24 hours after she endorsed him!' and from campaign strategist Hank Sheinkopf, who said 'No good deed goes unpunished. Hochul looks weak.' Sheinkopf also claimed Mamdani and the Democratic Socialists of America are in charge. Asian Wave Alliance member Yiatin Chu added 'Hochul got played.' Hochul, who is the de facto leader of New York\u2019s Democratic Party, had previously joked about Canada and criticized Hamas. A Siena College poll released Tuesday showed Hochul leading Stefanik 52% to 27% among registered voters in a potential match\u2011up, though Republican sources questioned its validity. A Democratic insider noted that Hochul will likely need Mamdani\u2019s turnout operation to win re\u2011election next year, saying 'Zohran holds the cards.

The endorsement followed a meeting between Mamdani and billionaire former mayor Michael\u202fBloomberg, who did not endorse him but met with him, according to the article. Hochul\u2019s endorsement broke a pattern of stone\u2011walling by senior Democrats, including Senators Chuck\u202fSchumer and Kirsten\u202fGillibrand and House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries. Mamdani is the frontrunner in a four\u2011way November\u202f4 election that also includes former Governor Andrew\u202fCuomo (running as an independent), incumbent Mayor Eric\u202fAdams (also independent) and Republican Curtis\u202fSliwa. House members Pat\u202fRyan, Gerry\u202fNadler, Senator Chris\u202fVan\u202fHollen and Representative Jamie\u202fRaskin have publicly endorsed Mamdani. Trump reacted to the endorsement with a threat, saying, 'This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New\u202fYork City. How can such a thing happen? Washington will be watching this situation very closely. No reason to be sending good money after bad!' The article also notes that Hochul\u2019s op\u2011ed in the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes emphasized police resources, quoting her as saying, 'I urged him to ensure that there is strong leadership at the helm of the N.Y.P.D. -- and he agreed.' It further describes Hochul as a right\u2011wing figure who has opposed driver\u2019s licenses for immigrant workers and deployed National Guard troops in subways. The piece portrays Bloomberg\u2019s meeting as cordial but not an endorsement, and claims that Mamdani has agreed to abandon certain rhetoric and will accept police presence, while warning that Trump may deploy the National Guard in New\u202fYork\u202fCity.

Hochul, a moderate Democrat, had endorsed him after weeks of hesitation, a move that has pressured other New York Democrats to support him. Mamdani's decision comes as Hochul faces potential challenges from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in the 2026 Democratic primary and from Republican Elise Stefanik in the general election.

Democratic Governor Kathy\u202fHochul endorsed Mamdani, declaring that \"New\u202fYork needs leaders who will put aside differences, stand up and fight back against Mr.\u202fTrump,\" a statement echoed by progressive Senator Bernie\u202fSanders, who said he could not understand why New\u202fYork leaders were not supporting the candidate. Republican President Donald\u202fTrump seized the opportunity to criticize Mamdani, labeling him a communist and threatening to withhold federal funds if he were elected. The article also notes that House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck\u202fSchumer have declined to endorse Mamdani, citing their own endorsement policies. The split is highlighted by contrasting endorsements within the New\u202fYork delegation: Rep.\u202fTom\u202fSuozzi declined to support Mamdani, while Rep.\u202fPat\u202fRyan endorsed him.

Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani, while other New York representatives have split, with Rep. Tom Suozzi refusing endorsement and Rep. Pat Ryan supporting him. The divide echoes the earlier rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has defended Mamdani. National progressive groups and figures like Joseph Geevarghese and Abdul El\u2011Sayed have expressed frustration at the establishment\u2019s silence. Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia have linked Mamdani to the Democratic brand in their campaigns.

Chris Van\u202fHollen, a Democrat from Maryland, urged New Yorkers to back Democratic nominee Zohran\u202fMamdani in the upcoming New\u202fYork City mayoral race, saying the party has drifted toward moneyed interests and lost its vision. In a speech in Iowa, Van\u202fHollen said, 'I believe we, the Democratic party - we've drifted... Too often we have come under the sway of powerful moneyed interests at the expense of working people.' Mam\u202fMamdani, a self\u2011proclaimed Democratic socialist, has campaigned on affordable housing, city\u2011owned grocery stores, free childcare and a new Department of Community Safety, and he said, 'There will be visible trained teams in our subways... Their presence and their work will make all of us safe.' Governor Kathy\u202fHochul endorsed Mam\u202fMamdani in a New\u202fYork\u202fTimes opinion piece, writing that she had 'frank conversations' with him and supports his goal of an affordable city. The endorsement prompted a response from former President Donald\u202fTrump, who on Truth\u202fSocial called the endorsement a 'rather shocking development' and suggested withholding federal funds if Mam\u202fMamdani wins. A New\u202fYork\u202fTimes/Siena poll released earlier this month shows Mam\u202fMamdani with 46\u202f% support, compared with 24\u202f% for former Governor Andrew\u202fCuomo (independent), 15\u202f% for Republican Curtis\u202fSliwa and 9\u202f% for incumbent Mayor Eric\u202fAdams.

    "summary": "Across a diverse set of expert perspectives covering political strategy, electoral analysis, political science, sociology, and minority representation, forecasts for Omar Fateh\u2019s chances in the 2025 Minneapolis mayoral election range from modest underdog status to slight favorite, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty and volatility. \n\nA recurring base rate is that incumbents in Minneapolis have won 60% of mayoral elections since 2001. However, unique factors in 2025\u2014most notably Fateh\u2019s initial DFL endorsement (later rescinded), a strong wave of progressive/DSA energy nationally (exemplified by Mamdani\u2019s NYC win), Frey's deeply negative favorability (-21%), and a less divided left/progressive field\u2014substantially increase Fateh\u2019s competitiveness relative to the typical challenger. Most analysts note the vacating of the DFL endorsement as a real setback for Fateh, diminishing institutional backing and potentially demobilizing some of his base, but conversely, his position as the insider-outsider progressive uniting much of the left remains unique. Ranked-choice voting is seen as providing a slight advantage to Fateh if progressives stay unified, but risks persist if moderate or process-conscious voters coalesce around Frey due to party chaos. Demographic and identity dynamics (Fateh\u2019s status as a Somali-American Muslim and community mobilization potential) are seen as both opportunities and points of risk, with possible backlash or anti-progressive sentiment among older and moderate voters.\n\nFinal probabilities offered by forecasters cluster in a relatively narrow band, mostly between 38% and 63% for a Fateh victory. A few analysts see Fateh as a slight favorite (56\u201363%), citing progressive momentum and anti-Frey sentiment outweighing organizational confusion. Others (38\u201344%) view him as a slight to moderate underdog, citing structural and procedural headwinds, historical incumbency, and uncertainty about turnout and coalition durability. In the middle, several forecasts (40\u201357%) reflect a tossup dynamic but give a marginal edge to anti-incumbent sentiment and national progressive energy. All agree the race is highly competitive, with turnout, effective coalition consolidation, and last-minute campaign dynamics likely to be decisive.\n\nIn summary, experts expect a close, high-variance contest, with Fateh\u2019s chances materially improved over historic base rates, but neither candidate a prohibitive favorite. The outcome will likely hinge on turnout shifts, coalition unity, and the ability of each side to overcome or exploit the lingering effects of the DFL endorsement controversy.\n",
