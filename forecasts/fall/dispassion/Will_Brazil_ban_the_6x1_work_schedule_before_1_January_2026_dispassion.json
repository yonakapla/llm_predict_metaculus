The Labor Minister and President are supportive, but both have stressed that only extraordinary mass mobilization could overcome congressional inertia, and no such groundswell is evident at this time. The legislative calendar is another critical constraint: with less than 100 days to go and a major holiday recess approaching, the window for passing complex labor reform is extremely narrow. Finally, most bills and amendments remain in committee stages, and resistance from business and parliamentary leaders persists.

Notably, several forecasters\u2014particularly those in Comparative Labor Law and Legislative Affairs\u2014emphasized that while a last-minute pivot to a regular law (rather than a PEC) could marginally increase the odds, there is still no sign of the seismic, unified pressure or coalition shifts that would make even this feasible within the remaining timeframe. The only substantive critique of my forecast suggested I might slightly underweight legislative flexibility, but I find this possibility still remote given current signals.

Furthermore, the possibility of some dynamic interplay between electoral incentives, the plebiscite, and late-2025 political calculations was raised as a minor tail risk.

The campaign, led by groups such as the MST, MTST, CUT, CTB, Sinteal, and left\u2011wing parties PT, PCdoB and PSOL, has been collecting votes and signatures since July, extending the period by a month to pressure the National Congress.  In Alagoas, physical ballot boxes were moved through schools, markets and other public spaces, while online voting codes were also distributed.  Organizers estimate that the plebiscite will exceed 10\u202f000 votes, though the exact total is not yet known.  The campaign\u2019s president, Izael\u202fRibeiro of Sinteal, said the widespread participation \u201cwas very large\u201d and that the proposal \u201chas a very positive reaction\u201d (Izael\u202fRibeiro, quoted).  He added that the results will be presented to President Lula next week to push for the reform of the income\u2011tax table, which is already in Congress under the sponsorship of Senator Renan\u202fCalheiros and Deputy Arthur\u202fLira.  The article notes that the plebiscite is a constitutional instrument (Art.\u202f14 of the Constitution, Lei\u202f9.709/98) that allows citizens to be consulted before a law is enacted.  The campaign\u2019s goal is to secure a tax\u2011justice measure that exempts those earning below R$5\u202f000 while increasing taxes on those earning above R$50\u202f000.

He said that without popular pressure the PEC would not advance, noting that the topic \"has great difficulty tramitar no Congresso Nacional\" and that a \"livre, leve, solto\" parliament would only harm workers. Marinho made the remarks on the \"Bom Dia Ministro\" program on the federal government channel. The PEC, introduced by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL\u2011SP) in February, proposes moving to a 4\u00d73 or 5\u00d72 schedule, arguing that 6\u00d71 \"escravizes workers\" by limiting family time.

He supports ending 6x1 and cutting the weekly work hour from 44 to 40. Marinho cited the successful street mobilization that led to the archiving of the PEC of blindagem as an example of pressure.

The proposal would require the pension to be paid within 30 days, the period allowed by current law, and if the payment is not resolved in that time, a provisional payment would be made. If the institution fails to comply, a 5\u202f% compensation on the unpaid amount would be granted. The bill preserves the existing exceptions in the Social Security Law for state and municipal public servants, such as incompatibility of pensions, suspension upon re\u2011entry to public service, verification or doubt of documents, revocation for acts affecting granted rights, and restitution of improper payments.\n\nThe proponent, Deputy Maricela Beltr\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez (MC), emphasized that the goal is to protect retirees from administrative inefficiency and financial disorder.

The ruling was supported by six ministers following rapporteur Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso, who argued that the change, enacted by law\u202f13.165/15, aims to reduce party fragmentation and frequent defections. The case was brought by Rede Sustentabilidade, whose party was registered with the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) in September\u202f2015 and would have had a 30\u2011day period to accept new members under the old rules. Barroso said, 'A migra\u00e7\u00e3o constante de parlamentares entre partidos esvazia a escolha feita nas urnas e enfraquece o papel dos partidos como express\u00e3o de projetos pol\u00edticos duradouros.'

He said that without popular pressure the PEC would not advance, noting that the topic \"has great difficulty tramitar no Congresso Nacional\" and that a \"livre, leve, solto\" parliament would only harm workers. Marinho made the remarks on the \"Bom Dia Ministro\" program on the federal government channel. The PEC, introduced by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL\u2011SP) in February, proposes moving to a 4\u00d73 or 5\u00d72 schedule, arguing that 6\u00d71 \"escravizes workers\" by limiting family time.

Under the new rule, a customer must authorize the debit in the app of their financial institution before the money leaves their account. The BC says the mandatory use of Pix automatic brings greater convenience and control to customers and prevents unauthorized charges. The measures take effect on 13 October 2025, with a deadline of 1 January 2026 for institutions to adjust contracts and authorizations. The BC claims that Pix automatic can increase competition, reduce delinquency, improve operational efficiency and lower collection costs. The rule does not apply when the institution that holds the payer\u2019s account is also the recipient of the funds. The article explains how Pix automatic works for recurring payments and outlines additional security measures the BC is implementing after a series of cyber attacks, such as limiting Pix access for institutions using PSTIs, tightening transaction value limits, and extending the block period for large transfers. The BC says, 'O BC diz que a ado\u00e7\u00e3o do Pix autom\u00e1tico tem o potencial de aumentar a competi\u00e7\u00e3o, reduzir a inadimpl\u00eancia, elevar a efici\u00eancia de processos operacionais e diminuir os custos dos procedimentos de cobran\u00e7a.'

The rejection was unanimous, with the Senate\u2019s Constitution and Justice Committee and President Davi Alcolumbre voting against it. The author frames this decision as evidence that the \"ronco das ruas\" (the roar of the streets) still holds power over the Congress.\n\nThe piece traces the history of the \"ronco das ruas\" from the early 1960s, when President Jo\u00e3o Goulart relied on popular mobilisations to defend his reforms, through the 1968 \"Passeata dos 100 Mil\" in Rio de Janeiro, where more than 100,000 students, artists, intellectuals and workers protested the military regime. The protest was followed on 13\u202fDecember\u202f1968 by the decree of AI\u20115, which closed Congress, suspended civil liberties and granted absolute power to the executive, ushering in the most brutal phase of the dictatorship.\n\nAfter two decades of silence, the \"ronco das ruas\" re\u2011emerged during the Diretas J\u00e1 movement (1983\u20111984). Leaders such as Ulysses Guimar\u00e3es, Leonel Brizola and Tancredo Neves used the popular pressure\u2014\"mais de um milh\u00e3o\" attended the Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9 rally\u2014to push Congress toward redemocratization, culminating in the 1988 Constitution.\n\nThe article then highlights the 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2023 inauguration of President Lula, where \"centenas de milhares\" of Brazilians gathered in Bras\u00edlia, a democratic celebration that forced the Bolsonaro\u2011led coup plotters to postpone their attempt. The failed coup on 8\u202fJanuary\u202f2024 is described as a \"golpe dentro do golpe\" that was thwarted by institutional resistance and international pressure.\n\nFinally, the author notes that on 21\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 the \"ronco das ruas\" again echoed strongly, threatening to halt attempts at amnesty, shielding and fa\u00e7ade pacification that would absolve former coup plotters. The narrative concludes that Congress moves not by virtue but by calculation, and the roar of the streets is decisive.\n\nKey metrics cited: 100\u202f000 protesters in 1968; more than 1\u202fmillion at the Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9 rally; 21\u202fyears of dictatorship (1964\u20111985); 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2023 inauguration; 8\u202fJanuary\u202f2024 coup attempt; 21\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 protests.\n\nNotable quotes from the article (single\u2011quoted as requested): 'o ronco das ruas', 'PEC da Bandidagem', 'PEC da Blindagem', 'AI\u20115', 'golpe dentro do golpe', 'Diretas J\u00e1', 'Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o Cidad\u00e3', 'ronco das ruas', 'Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o Cidad\u00e3', 'ronco das ruas', 'ronco das ruas', 'ronco das ruas'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 11:27 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/blog/o-ronco-das-ruas-o-enterro-da-pec-da-blindagem-e-o-8-de-janeiro)\n\n**Minister of Labor says government supports ending 6x1 schedule and defends 'pressure' on Congress**\nThe Brazilian Minister of Labor, Luiz Marinho, said on September 25, 2025 that ending the 6\u2011day work schedule (6x1) will only succeed if the National Congress is subjected to 'muita press\u00e3o' (heavy pressure). He supports ending 6x1 and cutting the weekly work hour from 44 to 40. Marinho cited the successful street mobilization that led to the archiving of the PEC of blindagem as an example of pressure. In February, Deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL\u2011SP) introduced a constitutional amendment to reduce the maximum weekly work time to 36 hours over four days.

The article notes that this issue was part of the Livre party\u2019s electoral platform and had already been on the agenda of the XXIII Constitutional Government led by Ant\u00f3nio Costa in 2023. It also highlights that Portuguese workers often exceed the 40\u2011hour limit set by Law No. 7/2009 of the Labor Code, with the article explicitly mentioning \"acima das 40 horas permitidas pela Lei n\u00ba 7/2009 do C\u00f3digo do Trabalho.\" These points illustrate the broader context of labor reforms and the push for more flexible working arrangements.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 04:14 PM\nSource:[Jornal Expresso](https://expresso.pt/revista/fisga/2025-09-09-trabalhar-menos-e-melhor--poucas-empresas-experimentam-a-semana-de-quatro-dias-mas-quando-o-fazem-a-maior-parte-nao-quer-voltar-atras-398d5ec2)\n\n**Life Beyond Work: Ending the 6\u00d71 Schedule Revives Brazil's Historical Struggle**\nThe article discusses the Brazilian proposal to abolish the 6\u00d71 work schedule, a system that has been criticized for overworking employees. According to the International Labour Organization, the average weekly working hours in Brazil in 2023 were 39, lower than India (47), China (46) and Mexico (44), but higher than Germany (34), Australia (32) and Canada (32). The piece cites several stakeholders: deputy Bella\u202fGon\u00e7alves (Psol) said, 'A luta pelo fim da escala 6\u00d71 \u00e9 uma pauta muito importante do mundo do trabalho\u2026 talvez seja a primeira vez em muitos anos que uma pauta positiva ganha uma express\u00e3o e um debate p\u00fablico que chega praticamente em todas as pessoas'; economist Frederico\u202fMelo of Dieese explained that sectors such as agriculture, construction and commerce have the highest 40\u2011hour\u2011plus workloads and that the change would not lead to layoffs, calling the business argument a 'fal\u00e1cia'; CUT\u2011MG president Jairo\u202fNogueira highlighted the intensification of the 6\u00d71 schedule after the 2017 labor reform and noted that countries like Iceland, Belgium and the UK already test four\u2011day weeks. The article also reports that Dieese\u2019s April bulletin found the 2017 reform spread the 12\u00d736 schedule and promoted intermittent work, which disrupts social life and professional development. Workers such as Lucas\u202fSidrach of the Vida\u202fAl\u00e9m\u202fdo\u202fTrabalho movement argue that the current schedule hampers family life and mental health, while deputy Beatriz\u202fCerqueira (PT) posted on social media: 'Sim, existe vida al\u00e9m do trabalho\u2026 a luta de classes \u00e9 a matriz de todas as demais lutas'.

The committee was installed on Tuesday (19) and will be linked to the Labor Committee of the Chamber. The plan includes public hearings to hear from entrepreneurs, workers, university professors, and government representatives before the elaboration of the opinion. The intention is for the text to be later discussed in the Constitutional and Justice Commission (CCJ). 'We will evaluate which sectors still adopt the 6\u00d71 scale and what effects this change would have,' Gast\u00e3o said. The proposal also provides for the adoption of a 4\u00d73 schedule (four days of work and three days of rest) and the limitation of weekly working hours to 36 hours, without exceeding eight hours a day. Currently, the Constitution allows up to 44 hours a week. According to the work plan disclosed by the parliamentarian, the subcommittee seeks to consolidate a consensual text that guarantees balance between worker protection, business viability, and public account sustainability. The initiative of the PEC came from the Vida Al\u00e9m do Trabalho movement and has popular support from over 3 million signatures. The proposal had been postponed in 2024, when it depended on analysis by the CCJ, then led by the PL. Now, with the protocol effective, it will be up to the collegiate to evaluate the constitutionality of the measure.

The mobilization, which started spontaneously and gained strength among workers and experts, resulted in the Proposed Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) 8/2025, which proposes to prohibit this model of shift and establish a four-day workweek. However, the discussion about the shift schedule should not be seen as a simple dilemma between maintaining or abolishing the 6x1 schedule. It is necessary to evaluate the possibility of flexibility and negotiation between employers and employees, seeking solutions that respect workers' rights and the need for the labor market to adapt. According to historian data, reducing the work hours does not generate jobs, and in fact, the Brazilian productivity is one of the worst in the world, which would make it difficult for the country to compete externally. The justification that reducing work hours without reducing salaries would boost the Brazilian economy and reduce inequalities is an utopia. The data shows that no reduction in work hours has generated jobs, and the reduction of work hours does not guarantee an increase in quality of life. The approval of the PEC 8/2025 could lead to a wave of judicializations, with relevant impacts on labor law, economy and society.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 05, 2025 11:35 AM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/opiniao/artigos/reduzir-jornada-por-lei-nao-garante-emprego-nem-qualidade-de-vida/)\n\n**Redu\u00e7\u00e3o da jornada e fim da escala 6\u00d71 ser\u00e3o debatidos em evento das centrais sindicais em Porto Alegre**\nThe central unions are promoting an event in Porto Alegre on Monday (4) to discuss the proposal to reduce the working day without cutting salaries and the end of the 6\u00d71 schedule. The activity is part of the national mobilization in support of the Proposal of Constitutional Amendment (PEC) 148/2015, authored by Senator Paulo Paim (PT/RS), which proposes a gradual reduction of the weekly workload from 44 to 36 hours. According to Paim, the measure can generate millions of jobs and improve the quality of life of the working class. A study by the Dieese points out that the change can create around 3 million new jobs immediately. Paim also states that in 19 companies that tested the new model, one of them recorded a growth of almost 15% in revenue and productivity in 2024. 'This measure is fundamental, not only to increase free time and the quality of life of workers, but also to create jobs and promote better living conditions,' Paim explains. The deputy federal Daiana Santos (PCdoB) will also bring her Project of Law n\u00ba 67/2025 to the debate, which proposes a reduction of the weekly working day to 40 hours and the end of the 6\u00d71 schedule, with the guarantee of two consecutive days of remunerated rest per week. Santos defends that the reduction of the working day is a social justice and valuation of the working people agenda. She cites the example of developed countries like Belgium, Germany and Norway, which have adopted shorter working hours for years, understanding that rested and healthy workers are also more productive and contribute to economic growth. 'This is exactly the differential of our PL 67/2025, a possible project to be applied in the short term, with responsibility,' she highlights, recalling that the proposal has already received support from the Minister of Labor, Luiz Marinho, who recognized its viability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 07:54 PM\nSource:[Brasil de Fato](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2025/08/01/reducao-da-jornada-e-fim-da-escala-6x1-serao-debatidos-em-evento-das-centrais-sindicais-em-porto-alegre/)\n\n**Lula Defends Proposal to End 6x1 Work Schedule in Brazil**\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has defended the proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule in Brazil, which has been criticized by some for being too rigid.

This was an extraordinary thing in my time, but today's youth does not want this anymore. We will try to present a new way of working in this country, so that we can guarantee more mobility for people.' A survey by the Instituto de Economia da Unicamp found that 37% of workers with a formal contract would benefit directly from the reduction of the work schedule, while 38% of the occupied population, mostly informal workers with a work schedule above 36 hours a week, would be indirectly affected. The proposal to end the 6x1 schedule is supported by 64% of Brazilians, according to a Datafolha survey from December 2024. However, some business entities and trade unions have expressed concerns that the reduction of the work schedule could lead to increased costs for companies, higher prices for products and services, and negative effects on the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 08:48 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2025/07/lula-critica-jornada-6x1-e-diz-que-quer-discutir-assunto-com-empresarios-e-sindicalistas.shtml)\n\n**PT Proposes New Bill to End 6\u00d71 Work Schedule and Reduce Working Hours**\nThe Workers' Party (PT) has submitted a new bill (PL) to the Brazilian Congress, aiming to abolish the 6\u00d71 work schedule and reduce the weekly working hours from 44 to 36 hours without any salary reduction. According to PT members, a quorum of votes for a bill is easier to achieve than the 308 votes required to pass a Constitutional Amendment (PEC). A similar proposal was previously presented by \u00c9rika Hilton (PSol-SP) and Reginaldo Lopes (PT-MG), but none of them have advanced in the Chamber of Deputies due to strong resistance from parliamentarians who believe that reducing working hours would harm employers and the economy. The PT's proposal includes the following points: the inclusion of travel time as part of the working hours for jobs with difficult access or no public transportation; flexibility in negotiating time off for small and micro businesses; a maximum of two hours of overtime per day with special protection for pregnant and breastfeeding women; and the possibility of 12-hour shifts followed by 36 hours of rest for security and health professionals, as long as it is negotiated through a collective labor agreement. The PT justifies the measure by citing a survey that found 72% of Brazilians are stressed at work, and that in 2022, over 209,000 people were absent from work due to mental health issues. As stated by the PT, 'the time has come to rethink the way we work and prioritize the well-being of workers.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[A Rede](https://arede.info/cotidiano/581419/bancada-do-pt-propoe-novo-projeto-pelo-fim-da-escala-de-trabalho-61)\n\n**PT Proposes Bill to End 6x1 Work Schedule and Reduce Work Hours**\nThe Workers' Party (PT) has submitted a bill (PL) to the Brazilian Congress, proposing to end the 6x1 work schedule and reduce the weekly work hours from 44 to 36 hours without reducing salaries. According to PT, it is easier to pass a bill with a quorum of votes than a Constitutional Amendment (PEC), which requires 308 votes. A PEC on the same topic was presented by \u00c9rika Hilton (PSol-SP) earlier this year, and another proposal by Reginaldo Lopes (PT-MG) also exists. However, no proposal to reduce work hours has advanced in the Chamber of Deputies due to strong resistance from parliamentarians, who believe that reducing work hours would harm employers and the economy. The PT justifies the measure, citing a survey that found 72% of Brazilians are stressed at work, and in 2022, over 209,000 people were absent from work due to mental health issues, according to the text submitted by the PT.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 07:28 PM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/bancada-do-pt-propoe-novo-projeto-pelo-fim-da-escala-de-trabalho-6x1)\n\n**PT Proposes Bill to Reduce Workweek to 36 Hours and End 6\u00d71 Shift Schedule**\nThe PT (Workers' Party) faction in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies has presented a bill to reduce the weekly workweek from 44 to 36 hours, without reducing salaries, and to end the 6\u00d71 shift schedule, which requires six consecutive days of work followed by one day of rest. The proposal also includes changes to the calculation of overtime, the definition of intraday breaks, and the treatment of travel time for workers with difficult access to their workplaces or no public transportation. According to the faction's press office, the initiative will be accompanied by a dialogue with the federal government to discuss the possibility of sending a similar bill to Congress in an urgent constitutional manner. The PT faction argues that, from a legal standpoint, it is not necessary to amend the Constitution to modify the 6\u00d71 shift schedule, as the article 7 of the Constitution only establishes a minimum of labor rights, and the 6\u00d71 schedule is established in the Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT), not in the Constitution. As such, a regular law can modify this regime, as long as it benefits the worker. There are two other initiatives in the works that address the same topic: PEC 221/2019, proposed by Reginaldo Lopes (PT-MG), and PEC 08/2025, proposed by Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 06:33 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/brasil/pt-protocola-projeto-para-reduzir-jornada-de-trabalho-para-36-horas-e-acabar-com-escala-6-1-tqu4avnm)\n\n**Goi\u00e1s Divided: Politicians, Workers, and Businessmen Weigh In on the 6x1 Work Schedule**\nA proposed amendment to the Brazilian Constitution, PEC 8/2025, aims to end the traditional 6x1 work schedule, which requires workers to work six consecutive days and rest only one. The proposal, presented by federal deputy Erika Hilton, seeks to guarantee at least two days of weekly rest to improve the physical and mental health of millions of Brazilians. According to a survey by the Instituto Locomotiva, 57% of the population supports the end of the 6x1 schedule. In Goi\u00e1s, the debate has also moved to local politics. State deputy Bia de Lima is in favor of the change, emphasizing that more rest time is essential, especially for women who work double shifts with domestic work and family care. On the other hand, state deputy Amauri Ribeiro is against the change, arguing that it may harm the economy. This concern is shared by the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Comercial, Industrial e de Servi\u00e7os do Estado de Goi\u00e1s (Acieg), which sees the proposal as a risk of increased costs and loss of competitiveness for companies. The Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores (CUT) defends that a rested worker produces more, gets sick less, and that the change would be positive for health and productivity in general, as said, 'um trabalhador descansado rende mais, adoece menos e que a mudan\u00e7a seria positiva para a sa\u00fade e a produtividade no geral'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 30, 2025 09:19 PM\nSource:[Jornal Op\u00e7\u00e3o](https://www.jornalopcao.com.br/ultimas-noticias/politicos-trabalhadores-e-empresarios-escala-6x1-divide-opinioes-em-goias-721345/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All eight experts forecast a low probability that Brazil will officially ban the 6x1 work schedule for most CLT workers before January 1, 2026, with final probability estimates tightly clustered between 7% and 8%. The experts converge on several key reasons: (1) There is overwhelming resistance in the National Congress, with about 70% of deputies opposed to banning the 6x1 work schedule, as evidenced by recent surveys and the stalled progress of both constitutional amendments (PECs) and ordinary bills. (2) Although President Lula, the Labor Minister, unions, and some left-wing parties strongly support the reform, executive and ministerial advocacy is not sufficient without massive street mobilization, which so far lacks the scale required to force rapid congressional action. (3) The legislative calendar is highly constricted, with only three months left before the deadline and a traditionally slow end-of-year session, making expedited passage of a complex labor reform extremely difficult. (4) Business interests and employer lobbies exert strong pressure against the ban, citing economic risks, costs, and competitiveness, which further entrench opposition in Congress. (5) The historical base rate for major labor reforms in Brazil is very low, particularly those that increase worker protections against organized business resistance, and most such reforms have taken years to pass. While all acknowledge the potential for a dramatic, last-minute surge in public mobilization to alter the political calculus (as with the rapid archiving of the PEC da Blindagem amid mass protest), they see little current evidence of such a groundswell emerging for the 6x1 issue, and note that the existing plebiscite and protests are significant but not unprecedented in scale. A 'Yes' outcome is conceivable only in the event of extraordinary and rapid political upheaval. Consequently, all experts judge a 'No' outcome\u2014no ban enacted before January 2026\u2014as strongly favored.",
