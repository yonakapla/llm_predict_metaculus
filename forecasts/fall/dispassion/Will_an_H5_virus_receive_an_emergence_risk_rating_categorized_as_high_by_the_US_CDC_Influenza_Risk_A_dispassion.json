Your reasoning justifies a nonzero risk, but not to the extent implied by a double-digit probability."

While the ongoing adaptation of H5N1 in cattle and rare unexplained human cases modestly increase risk, the IRAT's threshold for a 'high' emergence rating is both scientifically and administratively stringent. Rapid reassessment and publication of a high score within 2.5 months would almost certainly require a dramatic and highly publicized shift in the epidemiological situation\u2014which has not yet occurred.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAccording to [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/pandemic-flu/php/national-strategy/influenza-risk-assessment-tool.html):\r\n\r\n>The Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) is an evaluation tool developed by CDC and external influenza experts that assesses the potential pandemic risk posed by influenza A viruses that currently circulate in animals but not in humans.\r\n\r\nThe IRAT evaluates with respect to potential public health impact and emergence--the latter of which is defined as the potential to start spreading easily and efficiently in people, and is the factor that this question asks. To assess this potential for sustained human-to-human spread, researchers examine the following risk elements:\r\n\r\n- Human infections\r\n- Transmission in animal models\r\n- Receptor binding\r\n- Population immunity\r\n- Infections in animals\r\n- Genomic analysis\r\n- Antigenic relatedness\r\n- Global distribution of animals\r\n- Disease severity and pathogenesis\r\n \r\nAs of August 9, 2024, the [published IRAT](https://www.cdc.gov/pandemic-flu/php/monitoring/virus-description.html) potential emergence risk scores ranged from less than 3 (low risk) to 7.5 (upper moderate), The 7.5 was for a strain of H1N1, a Eurasian avian-like swine influenza A(H1N1) (A/swine/Shandong/1207/2016) virus, clade 1C.2.3 and genotype 4. Please see the full H1N1 Virus Report from July of 2020 [here](https://www.cdc.gov/pandemic-flu/media/pdfs/2024/08/CDC-IRAT-Virus-Report.pdf).

According to Andrey Sarana, head of the city's healthcare committee, both viruses are historically associated with severe pandemics and complications. H1N1, responsible for the 2009 global outbreak, poses a higher risk to young adults, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic illnesses. H3N2, first identified in the late 1960s, more commonly leads to complications in the elderly and frequent hospitalizations. Although modern strains typically cause milder illness, they present symptoms such as high fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, eye pain, and diarrhea occurring 5\u20136 times daily. As of the 40th week, only 0.2% of tests in Russia were positive\u2014about two cases per thousand\u2014while Saint Petersburg has confirmed 56 cases. The State Research Institute of Influenza has already isolated live H3N2 virus, indicating the start of transmission. However, population immunity remains low: only 27% of Saint Petersburg residents and 18% in Leningrad Oblast are vaccinated. To effectively control the winter wave, vaccination coverage must reach at least 60\u201363%\u2014over 3.5 million people. Immunity develops 2\u20134 weeks post-vaccination, with September and October being optimal, though November or December vaccinations still provide protection before the winter peak. Experts warn that low herd immunity increases the risk of prolonged transmission chains and severe disease in high-risk groups. Updated seasonal flu vaccines are already available in clinics: trivalent 'SoviGripp' and 'Flu-M' (for different age groups), which protect against A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B/Victoria; and quadrivalent 'Ultrix', which additionally covers B/Yamagata and is suitable for children and pregnant women. All vaccines meet WHO recommendations for the Northern Hemisphere.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 05:12 AM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.Ru](https://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2025/10/12/26937554.shtml)\n\n**Respiratory Diseases Enter High Incidence Season: Severe Lung Damage Possible if Symptoms Are Ignored**\nThe National Health Commission warned on October 9, 2025, that respiratory diseases have entered a high-incidence period following the end of the holiday season. In addition to common pathogens like influenza and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have shown a significant rise in multiple regions, with the outbreak occurring earlier than in previous years. In Shanghai Children's Hospital, the number of patients presenting with cough, phlegm, fever, and asthma has increased notably, and RSV has been the most frequently detected pathogen in respiratory departments. Doctors report that RSV affects not only children but also causes frequent household cross-infections; one 5-year-old patient\u2019s grandmother and mother also developed symptoms. Experts emphasize that RSV poses a severe threat to infants and the elderly, with high risk of progressing to severe illness, including respiratory distress requiring ICU admission. Individuals over 65 and those with chronic respiratory conditions are particularly vulnerable, as infection may lead to irreversible lung damage. The incubation period for the virus is 2 to 8 days, with early symptoms resembling a common cold. Warning signs include rapid breathing, wheezing, flaring nostrils, suprasternal retractions (triple depression sign), lethargy, and feeding difficulties\u2014requiring immediate medical attention. Prevention strategies include wearing masks in public, covering the mouth and nose during coughing or sneezing, avoiding crowded places for infants and the elderly, and cleaning hands and throat upon returning home. For symptoms like excessive phlegm, coughing, and wheezing, early use of 'Qingfei Huatan Wan' (Clear Lung and Resolve Phlegm Pills) is advised to prevent progression to severe illness. If symptoms such as yellow, thick phlegm, chest tightness, and persistent cough persist after fever resolves\u2014indicating 'phlegm-heat blocking the lungs'\u2014medical evaluation is essential to prevent chronic cough. The article stresses that while respiratory diseases should not be ignored, they should not provoke undue panic, and emphasizes the importance of scientific awareness, proactive prevention, and timely medical care to protect family health.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 01:36 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://tech.china.com/articles/20251011/202510111746113.html)\n\n**NIH-funded scientists engineered hybrid bird flu virus in Europe, tested in U.S.   - NaturalNews.com**\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), through its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), funded the creation of a genetically engineered hybrid bird flu virus in European laboratories, which was then shipped to the U.S. for live-animal testing. The virus, constructed using reverse genetics and dubbed UniFluVec, combined genetic material from H1N1, H2N2, and influenza B strains to create a chimeric pathogen designed to evade immune defenses. The research was conducted by Southern Research Institute in Birmingham, Alabama, under NIH supervision, with synthetic plasmids produced by GeneArt (a Thermo Fisher subsidiary) in Germany.

This naturally occurring probiotic colonizes the nasal mucosa for up to two weeks and secretes two key antiviral metabolites: novel surfactin derivatives (C16/C17) and piceatannol. The surfactin derivatives disrupt viral envelope phospholipid dynamics, preventing membrane fusion with host cells, while piceatannol increases lipid saturation and reduces membrane fluidity, blocking viral entry without damaging the viral structure. Together, these compounds form a 'molecular firewall' that inhibits enveloped viruses. In controlled experiments, NS12 significantly reduced viral loads, alleviated tissue damage, and improved survival rates in piglets infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). In a mouse model, NS12 also protected against pseudorabies virus (PRV), confirming cross-species efficacy. Unlike traditional vaccines, which offer limited, antigen-specific protection and are vulnerable to viral mutation, NS12 targets the viral envelope\u2014derived from host cells\u2014making resistance less likely. The study, published in Research on October 11, 2025, suggests NS12 could be developed into intranasal sprays, feed additives, or next-generation veterinary antivirals, with potential applications against human respiratory viruses like influenza and coronaviruses.

He explained that bird flu primarily affects wild birds and domestic poultry, with the H5N1 strain having a global fatality rate of approximately 50% among known human cases. However, there have been no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission in the U.S., and only 70 total human cases have been reported nationwide, including one death in Louisiana involving a person with significant pre-existing health conditions. Dr. Chan attributed the recent over 50% increase in egg prices to the bird flu\u2019s impact on poultry populations, which led to the culling of infected flocks. He noted that the CDC released a report indicating low-level asymptomatic circulation of the virus among people with frequent exposure to birds and cows, but emphasized that this does not indicate widespread risk. Dr. Chan advised the public to keep pets, especially cats, away from dead birds, as they are highly susceptible to the virus. He concluded that for the average Rhode Islander, bird flu should be 'the very lowest thing on your list to worry about,' citing CDC data and historical parallels to the H1N1 pandemic as reasons for cautious optimism.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 01, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[golocalprov.com](https://www.golocalprov.com/live/top-ri-doctor-chan-ranks-threat-to-rhode-islanders-from-the-bird-flu)\n\n**St. Petersburg on the Brink of a Dual Influenza Wave: Two Known Strains Return Simultaneously**\nSt. Petersburg is preparing for a dual wave of seasonal influenza, with two subtypes of influenza A\u2014H1N1 (\u2018swine flu\u2019) and H3N2 (\u2018Hong Kong flu\u2019)\u2014expected to circulate simultaneously. Both viruses are well-known due to past global pandemics and have historically caused severe complications: H1N1 primarily affected young adults, pregnant women, and those with chronic illnesses, while H3N2 is especially dangerous for the elderly, often leading to hospitalization and prolonged recovery. According to Andrey Sarana, head of the St. Petersburg Department of Healthcare, modern variants of these strains typically cause milder illness but still present strong symptoms such as high fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue, eye pain, and diarrhea up to six times daily. As of the 40th week, only 0.2% of tests in the city were positive\u2014about two cases per thousand tested. However, 56 cases have been confirmed in St. Petersburg, and the State Research Institute of Influenza has isolated the live H3N2 virus, indicating the start of local transmission. A major concern is low vaccination coverage: only 27% of St. Petersburg residents and 18% in Leningrad Oblast are vaccinated. Experts emphasize that at least 60\u201363% of the population\u2014around 3.5 million people\u2014must be vaccinated to achieve reliable herd immunity. Protection develops 2\u20134 weeks after vaccination, making even November or December vaccinations effective for winter protection. Optimal timing is September and October, when the virus is not yet active. Without collective immunity, the risk of prolonged transmission chains and severe illness in vulnerable populations increases. Vaccination remains beneficial even after October, as the flu virus remains active until March\u2013April. Available vaccines include 'Ultrix' (recommended for pregnant women and children), 'Sovigripp', and 'Flu-M' (for adults). Vaccinations are free in municipal clinics; private clinics charge between 600 and 1200 rubles. Mild fever after vaccination is normal and typically resolves in 1\u20132 days; persistent fever requires medical attention. While the return of H1N1 and H3N2 is not a cause for panic, it underscores the importance of proactive health measures: timely vaccination, hygiene, and self-monitoring. The city has a strong opportunity to manage the season calmly and safely if vaccination rates rise.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 07:42 AM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/health/2290660-seasonal-flu-vaccines/)\n\n**Two Dangerous Flu Strains Return to Saint Petersburg After 56 Years**\nThe Saint Petersburg Department of Healthcare announced that two dangerous influenza subtypes, 'swine' H1N1 and 'Hong Kong' H3N2, are expected to return in the upcoming autumn-winter season. According to Andrey Sarana, head of the city's healthcare committee, both viruses are historically associated with severe pandemics and complications. H1N1, responsible for the 2009 global outbreak, poses a higher risk to young adults, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic illnesses. H3N2, first identified in the late 1960s, more commonly leads to complications in the elderly and frequent hospitalizations. Although modern strains typically cause milder illness, they present symptoms such as high fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, eye pain, and diarrhea occurring 5\u20136 times daily. As of the 40th week, only 0.2% of tests in Russia were positive\u2014about two cases per thousand\u2014while Saint Petersburg has confirmed 56 cases. The State Research Institute of Influenza has already isolated live H3N2 virus, indicating the start of transmission. However, population immunity remains low: only 27% of Saint Petersburg residents and 18% in Leningrad Oblast are vaccinated. To effectively control the winter wave, vaccination coverage must reach at least 60\u201363%\u2014over 3.5 million people. Immunity develops 2\u20134 weeks post-vaccination, with September and October being optimal, though November or December vaccinations still provide protection before the winter peak. Experts warn that low herd immunity increases the risk of prolonged transmission chains and severe disease in high-risk groups. Updated seasonal flu vaccines are already available in clinics: trivalent 'SoviGripp' and 'Flu-M' (for different age groups), which protect against A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B/Victoria; and quadrivalent 'Ultrix', which additionally covers B/Yamagata and is suitable for children and pregnant women.

The data, sourced from the Okayama Prefecture official website, shows a slight decrease in the number of reported COVID-19 cases per point of surveillance to 10.16. While nationwide infection rates are declining, the pandemic remains ongoing. The report emphasizes the need for appropriate mask use and adequate ventilation, particularly to protect high-risk individuals. COVID-19-related hospitalizations continue, with ongoing cases of severe illness requiring early diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) and RS virus infections are currently on the rise.

Genomic analysis revealed the Kasai strain shares more than 99.5% identity with the lineage responsible for the 1976 Yambuku outbreak, indicating near-identical genetic stability over 50 years. This challenges the assumption that Ebola evolves steadily, as the strain shows minimal genetic change despite decades. Three hypotheses are proposed to explain this stasis: (1) persistence, where the virus remains dormant in tissues and reactivates years later\u2014supported by evidence of Ebola re-emergence in humans five years post-recovery and parallels with Lassa virus in rodents; (2) slow circulation at extremely low prevalence, where the virus persists in hidden transmission chains with minimal replication and mutation, akin to Marburg virus in fruit bats; and (3) ecological equilibrium, in which the virus replicates continuously in tolerant hosts without strong immune responses, though this lacks empirical support. Each model predicts distinct patterns: persistence would yield identical genomes across years, slow circulation would show gradual drift, and equilibrium would show year-round presence with low diversity. The absence of systematic, long-term ecological fieldwork limits testing these hypotheses. The Lancet emphasizes that genomic stasis in Ebola may be recurrent, undermining current surveillance assumptions and highlighting the need for a One Health approach\u2014monitoring human survivors, wildlife, and ecological changes\u2014to detect persistence before spillover.

Giovani Trevisan and Daniel Linhares to develop a data-driven swine disease index using 59,950 porcine cases from the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL) between 2020 and 2024. The index integrates four normalized variables\u2014disease occurrence, co-diagnoses, geographic spread, and Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) alarms\u2014weighted via an R-based function and combined into a single score ranging from 0.01 to 1, updated weekly. The results, validated using bootstrap resampling (500 iterations), Euclidean, and Manhattan distance models, show high year-to-year stability (Spearman correlation of 0.92). PRRSV and Streptococcus suis remained the top two ranked pathogens, indicating sustained high burden. However, porcine sapovirus and porcine astrovirus emerged as new priorities after increased cases in 2022 and 2023, respectively, while PCV2 declined out of the top 10 by 2024, possibly due to improved immunity, vaccination, or biosecurity. The system also captures non-infectious threats such as nutritional and toxicological diagnoses, which, though less frequent, show variability and sudden ranking shifts, underscoring the value of broad surveillance. The interactive Power BI dashboard, expected to launch in early 2026 on the Swine Disease Reporting System (SDRS) website, will enable real-time monitoring, year-over-year comparisons, and timely decision-making.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports 1,080 cattle cases across 18 states as of September 2025. Human infections have also been documented: 70 cases, primarily among farm workers, with one fatality. A study published in Science Advances identifies two mutations\u2014PB2-478I and NP-450N\u2014in the North American H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b that increase replication and virulence. Researchers led by Young\u2011Il Kim at the Korean Center for Emerging Virus Studies performed ferret experiments that showed removal of these mutations prevented systemic infection. The same team demonstrated that viruses carrying the mutations replicated efficiently in human cells and bovine mammary gland cells, underscoring the risk of cross\u2011species transmission.

According to virologist and infectologist Nacy Bellei, \"o foco e risco de uma nova pandemia vem principalmente das Am\u00e9ricas e dos Estados Unidos.\"  Nearly all U.S. states now have H5N1 foci in birds, dairy cattle, or other animals, and the virus is also endemic in animals in other American countries.  Since 2022, 70 human cases have been recorded in the U.S., most mild and primarily presenting with conjunctivitis.  Bellei explains that the virus preferentially binds to an avian\u2011type sialic acid receptor that is also common in the human eye and in bovine mammary glands, accounting for the ocular infections seen after contact with dairy cattle.  The article cites Infogripe data showing that 52\u202f% of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2011like) deaths this year were caused by influenza A, while influenza vaccination coverage among seniors was only 42\u202f%, the lowest in six years.  Bellei warns that the combination of widespread H5N1 circulation in animals, low human immunity, and potential reassortment with swine influenza creates an ideal scenario for a new pandemic.  She notes that prior H1N1 infection or vaccination may offer some protection, and that H5N1 vaccines\u2014both traditional and mRNA\u2014are already available for high\u2011risk groups.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 03:28 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/saude/risco-de-nova-pandemia-nesse-momento-vem-principalmente-das-americas-diz-virologista/)\n\n**United States Confirms Presence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed the detection of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in a dairy herd in Nebraska, identifying the strain as genotype B3.13 of the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b. The case was discovered through state\u2011led tracing after an initial sample was taken from milk for pre\u2011distribution surveillance, a procedure mandated by a federal USDA order issued in April 2024. This marks the first known H5N1 infection in bovine in Nebraska. Following the outbreak in March 2024, infections were reported in dairy cattle across 17 states, though the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) noted that cases remained confined to a limited number of states this year. APHIS is working closely with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture to conduct further investigations, testing, and epidemiological data collection to better understand the detection and prevent wider spread. The agency urged all dairy farms to strengthen biosecurity measures, especially ahead of the upcoming fall migratory bird season, while stating there is no concern that the situation poses a risk to consumer health or the commercial milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that pasteurization effectively inactivates H5N1, ensuring the safety of pasteurized dairy products, according to Xinhua news agency. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that H5N1 viruses circulating in birds and dairy cattle pose a low risk to the general public but warned that individuals with occupational or recreational exposure to infected birds or mammals face higher risk and should take appropriate precautions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 10:13 PM\nSource:[El Comercial](https://www.elcomercial.com.ar/47257-estados-unidos-confirma-la-presencia-de-gripe-aviar-altamente-patogena)\n\n**US confirms highly pathogenic avian flu in Nebraska dairy herd**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that a dairy cattle herd in Nebraska tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13, marking the first known case of HPAI in cattle in the state. The detection followed state\u2011led tracing after an initial finding in pre\u2011movement surveillance milk samples, which are required under a federal order issued by the USDA in April 2024. Since the outbreak began in March 2024, dairy cattle infections have been reported in 17 states, though the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) notes that cases have remained confined to a small number of states this year. APHIS is working closely with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture to conduct additional on\u2011farm investigation, testing and gather epidemiological information to better understand the detection and prevent further spread. The agency urged all dairy farms to strengthen biosecurity measures, especially as the fall migratory bird season approaches. The USDA stated that there is no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health or affects the safety of the commercial milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration confirmed that pasteurisation effectively inactivates H5N1, ensuring the safety of pasteurised milk products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that H5N1 viruses circulating in birds and U.S. dairy cattle are believed to pose a low risk to the general public, but warned that individuals with occupational or recreational exposure to infected birds or mammals are at higher risk and should take appropriate precautions. HPAI is a highly contagious transboundary disease with zoonotic potential, causing variable clinical signs and high mortality rates in both wild and domestic bird populations. Current outbreaks have severely impacted countries globally, causing losses of rare and important wild bird species, as well as significant social and economic costs, including livelihood losses and egg shortages. The spread of HPAI also strains poultry\u2011related businesses, as measures such as culling and movement restrictions are necessary to contain the virus, which can disrupt the trade of poultry products. The ongoing devastation highlights the urgent need for improved control measures to prevent spillover and viral changes that could lead to a global pandemic. HPAI also infects mammals and humans, posing serious public health risks; infected mammals include domestic cats, cattle, and wild animals such as foxes and seals, with human cases, although rare, occurring in those with close contact with infected poultry or environments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 03:57 AM\nSource:[Social News XYZ](https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/09/15/us-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-flu-in-nebraska-dairy-herd/)\n\n**Will Avian Flu Mutate and Spread Among Humans? Experts' Major Concerns**\nThe article reports a surge of H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in Andalusia, with dozens of birds dying in cities such as M\u00e1laga and Sevilla and a new focus identified in Do\u00f1ana. Local authorities have closed public spaces to prevent spread. Experts warn that while the current human infection risk is low, the real danger lies in the virus mutating to allow sustained human-to-human transmission.  According to Joaquim Segal\u00e9s, a professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, H5N1 has been a continuous threat to animal health since 2019\u201120 and has already caused major outbreaks in domestic birds.  Patricia Guillem Saiz, a researcher at the University of Valencia, notes that human cases have been rare and linked to direct exposure to infected birds, but that some documented cases in 2023\u201124 occurred in the United States, China and Cambodia.  Guillem stresses that \"the true fear is that the virus mutates to transmit efficiently between humans,\" adding that such a change could spark a new pandemic.  Segal\u00e9s highlights the increasing presence of H5N1 in mammals\u2014including dairy cattle and domestic animals\u2014which raises the risk of genetic reassortment and pandemic\u2011potential mutations.  He calls for intensified passive and active surveillance, strict monitoring of viral evolution, and a One Health approach involving the WHO, FAO and OIE to share genetic data and develop vaccines and antivirals.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 03:04 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/salud/2025-09-10/gripe-aviar-mutacion-humanos_4205474/)\n\n**California Child Infected With H5N1 Bird Flu, Source Unknown**\nA San\u202fFrancisco child infected with H5N1 bird flu in December\u202f2024 was identified through enhanced surveillance, but no clear source of exposure was found. The case, reported by the San\u202fFrancisco Department of Public Health and the CDC in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on September\u202f4\u202f2025, involved a school\u2011aged child who exhibited typical flu\u2011like symptoms\u2014fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and conjunctivitis\u2014for about a week before testing positive for H5N1. Authorities traced 67 close contacts\u2014including household members, classmates, and health\u2011care providers\u2014but all tested samples were negative, leaving no evidence of onward transmission. The child had not traveled, visited farms, or been near poultry or wild birds; the family had purchased poultry from a live\u2011bird market, but it was cooked and eaten well before the illness began. Genetic sequencing identified the virus as clade\u202f2.3.4.4b, genotype\u202fB3.13, the same lineage driving the California dairy outbreak and found in cats and wild birds, yet it lacked mutations associated with efficient human\u2011to\u2011human transmission. This case is one of 70 confirmed U.S. H5N1 infections since 2023, with only three\u2014this one included\u2014having no identifiable source. American cases have largely been mild, with one death reported, contrasting with the higher fatality rates seen globally. The incident underscores gaps in understanding environmental reservoirs and transmission pathways of H5N1 in urban settings and highlights the need for rapid diagnostic capacity and robust surveillance. The CDC currently rates the risk to the public as 'low', but the unknowns remain significant.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndrake/2025/09/05/california-child-infected-with-h5n1-bird-flu-source-unknown/)\n\n**Low Risk of Avian Influenza to Global Public Health, According to WHO, FAO, and OIE**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have published a report stating that the risk of avian influenza to global public health is low. However, they note that the risk of infection for people exposed professionally or frequently (e.g., to domestic poultry) is low to moderate, depending on risk mitigation and hygiene measures, as well as local epidemiological situation. The organizations report that animal-to-animal transmission continues, and a limited number of human infections have been reported. Although more human infections are expected due to exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments, they assure that the global impact on public health is currently considered minor. 'The evaluation could change if additional epidemiological or virological information becomes available,' they add. The organizations emphasize the importance of timely notification to global authorities and the use of a 'One Health' approach to effectively address avian influenza. As of March 1 to July 1, 2025, 807 additional outbreaks of A(H5N1) in animals (including bird and mammal species) have been reported, with 268 in domestic poultry, 389 in wild birds, and 92 in mammal species. Since the last joint evaluation in April 2025, 16 additional human cases of A(H5N1 infection have been detected, with 9 in Cambodia, 2 in Bangladesh and India, and 1 in China, Mexico, and Vietnam. 'The source of infection for the Mexican case was likely indirect exposure to domestic or wild birds,' and no information was available on exposure in one of the Indian cases. No human-to-human transmission was suspected in these confirmed cases. The viruses from the Indian and two Bangladesh cases belong to the 2.3.2.1a HA virus clade, while the viruses from all Cambodian cases belong to the 2.3.2.1e HA virus clade. The viruses from the Chinese and Mexican cases belong to the 2.3.4.4b HA virus clade. The organizations recommend that member states and national authorities increase surveillance and attention in human populations, especially among people exposed for work-related reasons, due to the possibility of zoonotic infections. They also advise evaluating and reducing the risk among people exposed for work-related reasons, using methods such as active case detection. Furthermore, they suggest conducting active case detection around suspected and confirmed human cases to determine if there are additional cases. Additionally, they request collaboration with national authorities to better understand the risk of unpasteurized raw milk and dairy products.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 01:28 AM\nSource:[El Diario - Manabita](https://www.eldiario.ec/el-riesgo-de-la-gripe-aviar-para-la-salud-mundial-es-bajo-segun-informe-de-la-oms-20250729/)\n\n**Genotype B3.13 influenza A(H5N1) viruses isolated from dairy cattle demonstrate high virulence in laboratory models, but retain avian virus-like properties - Nature Communications**\nResearchers have studied the genotype B3.13 influenza A(H5N1) viruses isolated from dairy cattle and found that they demonstrate high virulence in laboratory models, but retain avian virus-like properties. The viruses were tested for their replication capacity, receptor binding preferences, pathogenesis in mice, and transmission dynamics in ferrets. The results showed that the bovine viruses were highly virulent in mice, causing 100% mortality at doses of >10 TCID, and were also transmissible in ferrets through contact route but failed to transmit via the airborne route. The viruses were also lethal to chickens and were comparable in pathogenicity to the avian-origin virus. However, the bovine A(H5N1) viruses retained susceptibility to FDA-approved antiviral drugs and vaccines made using available clade 2.3.4.4b candidate vaccine viruses may protect against bovine A(H5N1) viruses in the event of a pandemic. Additionally, human sera obtained from a Phase 1 A(H5N8) clade 2.3.4.4c vaccine trial showed cross-reactive HA antibodies against bovine A(H5N1) 2.3.4.4b viruses, suggesting that vaccination of some humans with an adjuvanted vaccine using an A(H5N8) 2.3.4.4c antigen induces sufficient HA antibody responses that could offer protection against HA clade-mismatched virus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 23, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61757-3)\n\n**Risk posed by the HPAI virus H5N1, Eurasian lineage goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b. genotype B3.13, currently circulating in the US**\nThe highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus, genotype B3.13, has been detected in U.S. dairy cattle, marking a significant shift in its host range and epidemiological profile. Infected cattle exhibit mild clinical signs, with transmission primarily driven by contaminated milk and milking procedures. The virus demonstrates high replication in mammary glands, with infected cows shedding large quantities of virus in milk for up to 3 weeks. Between March 2024 and May 2025, the virus was confirmed in 981 dairy herds across 16 U.S. states, with California particularly affected. Risk factors for between-farm spread include cattle movement, shared equipment, and contact with external personnel. Biosecurity measures, such as waste management and wildlife deterrence, may reduce the risk of virus introduction. Potential pathways of introduction of HPAI B3.13 virus into the EU via trade from the US include the import of lactating cows and bovine meat, as well as products containing raw milk. Migratory birds, particularly waterfowl, also pose a potential pathway for introduction during seasonal migrations. The detection of mammalian-adaptive mutations and zoonotic cases underscores the virus' public health relevance and the need for research, surveillance, and cross-sectoral preparedness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 08:59 AM\nSource:[European Food Safety Authority](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/9508)\n\n**GoLocalProv | Live | Top RI Doctor Chan Ranks Threat to Rhode Islanders From Bird Flu**\nDr. Philip Chan, a top Rhode Island health official, assessed the threat of bird flu (H5N1) to Rhode Islanders on March 1, 2025, stating that the risk to the general population remains low. He explained that bird flu primarily affects wild birds and domestic poultry, with the H5N1 strain having a global fatality rate of approximately 50% among known human cases. However, there have been no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission in the U.S., and only 70 total human cases have been reported nationwide, including one death in Louisiana involving a person with significant pre-existing health conditions. Dr. Chan attributed the recent over 50% increase in egg prices to the bird flu\u2019s impact on poultry populations, which led to the culling of infected flocks. He noted that the CDC released a report indicating low-level asymptomatic circulation of the virus among people with frequent exposure to birds and cows, but emphasized that this does not indicate widespread risk. Dr. Chan advised the public to keep pets, especially cats, away from dead birds, as they are highly susceptible to the virus. He concluded that for the average Rhode Islander, bird flu should be 'the very lowest thing on your list to worry about,' citing CDC data and historical parallels to the H1N1 pandemic as reasons for cautious optimism.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 01, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[golocalprov.com](https://www.golocalprov.com/live/top-ri-doctor-chan-ranks-threat-to-rhode-islanders-from-the-bird-flu)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across eight experts specializing in influenza surveillance, veterinary medicine, global health security, epidemiology, virology, and public health policy, there is a unanimous consensus that the probability of an H5 influenza virus receiving a 'high' (\u22658.0) emergence risk rating by the CDC IRAT before January 1, 2026, is low. Current and historical base rates are a major anchor: no H5 virus has ever crossed this threshold, with the latest H5N1 score at 5.79 (moderate). While recent developments\u2014such as mammalian-adaptive mutations (PB2-478I and NP-450N), widespread outbreaks in cattle, and an uptick in sporadic human cases\u2014do increase concern and the theoretical potential for a rapid risk escalation, these have not yet resulted in efficient or sustained human-to-human transmission, which experts identify as a required trigger for a high rating. All experts cite the conservative and deliberative nature of IRAT scoring, the slow official cadence for such updates, and the low population-level risk assessments from CDC, WHO, and other authorities. There is recognition of a nonzero chance that a dramatic genetic or epidemiological event (such as a clear cluster of sustained human-to-human transmission or a sudden critical reassortment) could prompt a rapid re-evaluation, but the short remaining window (about 2.5 months to the deadline) further narrows that probability. Final probabilities assigned by the experts cluster tightly between 6% and 12%, with most at 7\u20138%. The collective analysis points strongly toward a No outcome by the specified date, with risk described as higher than in previous years but still modest without major new evidence.",
