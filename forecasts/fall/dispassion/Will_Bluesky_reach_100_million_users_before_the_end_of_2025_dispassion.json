The company first reported 20\u202fbillion MAU in October\u202f2022, and within less than three years hit the new benchmark. Zuckerberg also noted that Facebook\u2019s MAU exceeded 30\u202fbillion in January and WhatsApp\u2019s MAU surpassed 30\u202fbillion in April. Meta acquired Instagram in 2012 for US$1\u202fbillion, a move that was initially questioned because Instagram was then a low\u2011profit photo\u2011sharing platform. Since then, Instagram has grown into a diversified social\u2011media ecosystem, serving as a key platform for e\u2011commerce, advertising, and content creation. Analysts project that by 2025 Instagram will contribute more than half of Meta\u2019s U.S. advertising revenue. Instagram launched the short\u2011video feature Reels in 2020 to compete with TikTok and YouTube Shorts, boosting user engagement. The most followed individual on Instagram is football star Cristiano Ronaldo, with 6.6\u202fbillion followers, followed by Lionel Messi with 5\u202fbillion. Meta\u2019s July\u202f2025 earnings report highlighted stronger-than\u2011expected results, attributing growth to AI\u2011driven advertising efficiencies. The Meta family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.) reported a cumulative 34.8\u202fbillion daily active users, an 11\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year increase in ad impressions, and a 9\u202f% rise in average ad price.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://technews.tw/2025/09/25/instagram-surpasses-3-billion-monthly-active-users/)\n\n**Instagram Reaches 3\u202fBillion Monthly Active Users**\nMeta\u2019s Instagram platform has surpassed 3\u202fbillion monthly active users, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram head Adam\u202fMosseri, as announced on September\u202f24\u202f2025. This milestone matches other Meta networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp, which already had 3\u202fbillion users. The last time Instagram reported user numbers was in 2022, when it reached 2\u202fbillion. In April\u202f2024 Meta announced it would stop publishing monthly or daily user metrics, instead releasing quarterly figures to investors. Mosseri thanked users and said the platform will continue to focus on three core pillars: Reels, DMs, and recommendations. He added, 'Se voc\u00ea olhar para os \u00faltimos anos, quase todo o nosso crescimento foi impulsionado por DMs, Reels e recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es [...] Por isso, continuaremos a focar nesses produtos e reorientar o aplicativo mais para DMs, Reels e recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es nos pr\u00f3ximos meses.'

Everything to know about the X competitor.**\nBluesky, a decentralized social network launched by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has grown to over 30\u202fmillion users by February\u202f2025, driven by policy changes at X and post\u20112024 election migration. The platform uses the open\u2011source AT Protocol, offers a Twitter\u2011like interface, and is free. It has introduced features such as custom feeds, a Starter Pack, and a video tab. Bluesky has attracted high\u2011profile users including Alexandria Ocasio\u2011Cortez, Mark Cuban, and former U.S. presidents. The company has raised $15\u202fmillion in Series\u202fA and is developing a subscription service, Bluesky+, while maintaining a policy of not selling user data. It has faced moderation controversies, including a 17\u2011fold rise in reports in 2024, and has expanded its moderation team to about 100 moderators. The platform emphasizes decentralization, allowing users to port accounts to other AT\u2011Protocol apps.

The update is part of a broader review that began in January 2025. After the initial release, the platform collected feedback from more than 14,000 users, who offered suggestions on how the rules could affect creative expression and 'traditionally marginalized voices'. In a statement, Bluesky said, 'After considering this feedback, and returning to our experimental roots, we will focus on encouraging constructive dialogue and applying our rules against harassment and toxic content. To start, we will intensify our enforcement efforts.' A spokesperson told TechCrunch that from now on, users who break the rules will receive fewer warnings before their accounts are deactivated. The changes also clarify the permissions tied to the four core principles\u2014Safety First, Respect for Others, Authenticity, and Rule Compliance\u2014and provide clearer definitions to reduce vague terms. A new section dedicated to journalism, education, law, and mental\u2011health content was added to reduce uncertainty about how the guidelines apply in those areas. Bluesky also announced development of features such as a 'zen mode' and tips for more constructive conversations, aiming to make social media more authentic, informative and human again.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 07:28 PM\nSource:[Canaltech](https://canaltech.com.br/internet/bluesky-esta-levando-mais-a-serio-ideia-de-expulsar-usuarios-e-reforca-moderacao/)\n\n**Zuckerberg Surprises the World: Instagram Reaches 3\u202fBillion Monthly Active Users**\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, announced that Instagram has exceeded 3\u202fbillion monthly active users, a milestone he described as \"\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639\" (great).

The milestone was achieved less than two years after Instagram hit two billion MAU in October 2022. According to CNBC, Zuckerberg described the community as '\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c'. Meta announced in April 2024 that it would stop publishing separate quarterly data for daily and monthly active users for Facebook and other apps, instead reporting a combined daily active user (DAU) figure for all apps. In July, the combined DAU reached 3.48\u202fbillion, surpassing analysts\u2019 forecast of 3.45\u202fbillion. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said Facebook had more than three billion MAU and that WhatsApp had also crossed the three\u2011billion mark.

Everything to know about the X competitor.**\nBluesky, a decentralized social network launched by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has grown to over 30\u202fmillion users by February\u202f2025, driven by policy changes at X and post\u20112024 election migration. The platform uses the open\u2011source AT Protocol, offers a Twitter\u2011like interface, and is free. It has introduced features such as custom feeds, a Starter Pack, and a video tab. Bluesky has attracted high\u2011profile users including Alexandria Ocasio\u2011Cortez, Mark Cuban, and former U.S. presidents. The company has raised $15\u202fmillion in Series\u202fA and is developing a subscription service, Bluesky+, while maintaining a policy of not selling user data. It has faced moderation controversies, including a 17\u2011fold rise in reports in 2024, and has expanded its moderation team to about 100 moderators. The platform emphasizes decentralization, allowing users to port accounts to other AT\u2011Protocol apps. The article presents facts and metrics without overt bias, noting that \"You'll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 09:33 PM\nSource:[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/)\n\n**Bluesky Strengthens Moderation and Expulsion Policy**\nBluesky, the social network, announced on September 19 a new set of community guidelines that strengthen its ability to expel users who violate rules and increase moderation efforts. The update is part of a broader review that began in January 2025. After the initial release, the platform collected feedback from more than 14,000 users, who offered suggestions on how the rules could affect creative expression and 'traditionally marginalized voices'. In a statement, Bluesky said, 'After considering this feedback, and returning to our experimental roots, we will focus on encouraging constructive dialogue and applying our rules against harassment and toxic content. To start, we will intensify our enforcement efforts.' A spokesperson told TechCrunch that from now on, users who break the rules will receive fewer warnings before their accounts are deactivated. The changes also clarify the permissions tied to the four core principles\u2014Safety First, Respect for Others, Authenticity, and Rule Compliance\u2014and provide clearer definitions to reduce vague terms. A new section dedicated to journalism, education, law, and mental\u2011health content was added to reduce uncertainty about how the guidelines apply in those areas. Bluesky also announced development of features such as a 'zen mode' and tips for more constructive conversations, aiming to make social media more authentic, informative and human again.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 07:28 PM\nSource:[Canaltech](https://canaltech.com.br/internet/bluesky-esta-levando-mais-a-serio-ideia-de-expulsar-usuarios-e-reforca-moderacao/)\n\n**X Reports A Sharp Dip in Q2 Ad Revenue Despite Earlier Momentum**\nX, formerly Twitter, reported a 2.2% decline in ad revenue for the three months ending June\u202f30\u202f2025, pulling in $707\u202fmillion, even though the platform still saw a roughly 20% year\u2011over\u2011year increase. The quarter\u2011on\u2011quarter drop signals a slowdown in momentum that began earlier in the year, following a surge in advertiser interest during Q1\u202f2025 after the 2024 U.S. election. The renewed enthusiasm was not sustained, with the Q2 intake suggesting a struggle to retain ad spending. This was compounded by Elon Musk\u2019s public fallout with then\u2011President Donald Trump and his subsequent announcement to \u2018swear off politics,\u2019 which dissipated some of the initial momentum. Part of X\u2019s strategy to reduce its dependency on advertising has been to pivot toward subscription services and other non\u2011ad revenue streams, but these efforts have not scaled quickly enough to offset the slipping ad sales. While X Premium is bringing in some revenue, it is not at the level needed to fill the financial gap. Other initiatives, such as the \u2018X Money\u2019 payments feature, have been held up by regulatory approvals, further delaying diversification efforts. With an estimated $2.9\u202fbillion in total revenue projected for 2025 and about $1.2\u202fbillion in annual debt servicing costs, X is under intense pressure to perform. The company\u2019s recent merger with xAI, which is reportedly burning through $1\u202fbillion per month on infrastructure, adds another layer of financial risk. Meanwhile, Meta\u2019s Threads continues to grow, posing a significant threat to X\u2019s mobile app user base and potentially siphoning away ad dollars. For X to navigate its financial challenges, regaining advertiser confidence will be crucial, likely depending on maintaining policy consistency and ensuring user growth in the face of stiff competition. The performance of its non\u2011ad revenue streams will be under scrutiny, as their success is vital for the platform\u2019s long\u2011term sustainability. The outcome of X\u2019s AI ambitions, particularly its integration with xAI, will also play a significant role in its future trajectory. Ultimately, the platform\u2019s ability to balance its transition toward an AI\u2011centric model with the demands of a volatile ad market will determine its success in the coming years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 09:21 AM\nSource:[TechJuice](https://www.techjuice.pk/x-reports-a-sharp-dip-in-q2-ad-revenue-despite-earlier-momentum/)\n\n**Who&#x2019;s Next? Bluesky Posters Call for Deaths of Prominent Republicans, Conservative Media Figures**\nFollowing the murder of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, users on the Bluesky app have posted calls for the deaths of several high\u2011profile right\u2011wing figures, including Elon Musk, Donald Trump, J.K. Rowling, Ben Shapiro, Matt\u202fWalsh and Michael\u202fKnowles. Screenshots show threats ranging from violent language to explicit suggestions of who should be targeted next. BlueSky, which has about 1.5\u202fmillion daily users, issued warnings on Thursday that such posts violated its community guidelines, which prohibit 'encouragement of violence against individuals, groups, institutions or the general public' and 'wishes of harm directed at a specific person or group.' The platform, founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has become a sanctuary for progressives after Musk's overhaul of Twitter as X and Trump's 2024 victory. Other right\u2011wing influencers\u2014Chaya Raichik, Andy Ngo, Christopher Rufo and Benny Johnson\u2014have also been targeted. Earlier this summer, far\u2011left extremists on BlueSky had posted threats against federal officers and sought personal information about their families. The New\u202fYork\u202fPost confirmed that some of the violent posts were removed by Thursday evening. In response, other platforms such as Meta, YouTube, Discord and Reddit have flagged graphic content and removed posts celebrating Kirk's death or restricted them from younger users.

In a post on its Safety account, Bluesky said, 'Glorifying violence or harm violates Bluesky's Community Guidelines. We review reports and take action on content that celebrates harm against anyone.' It added, 'Violence has no place in healthy public discourse, and we're committed to fostering healthy, open conversations.' The platform stated that any user who violates this policy could have their account suspended or removed. Other platforms\u2014Meta, YouTube, Reddit, Discord\u2014also condemned posts about the shooting, and MSNBC fired a political analyst for remarks made after the incident. Bluesky was founded as a side project of Twitter in 2019, became independent in 2021, and launched publicly in 2023 after Elon\u202fMusk bought Twitter for $44\u202fbillion in late 2022. The article notes that the platform gained two million new users after Musk joined the Trump administration in November\u202f2024. Charlie\u202fKirk, founder of Turning Point\u202fUSA, was 31 when he was killed 20\u202fminutes into his 'American Comeback' event. The university hosting the event said it would uphold First Amendment rights. The article also reports that Meta spokesperson Francis\u202fBrennan said the platform would remove graphic content and add warning labels, Reddit spokesperson Gina\u202fAntonini said its rules prohibit encouraging or glorifying violence, and YouTube spokesperson Jack\u202fMalon expressed condolences and said it was monitoring for graphic videos.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 03:02 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15088505/Bluesky-warning-Charlie-Kirk-assassination.html)\n\n**Bluesky Seeks Its Place After Surfing Elon Musk\u2019s 'Flight Effect': 'The Exodus Is Over'**\nBluesky, the Twitter\u2011alternative platform, has experienced a rapid user\u2011growth surge in the fall of 2024. According to a simple web page maintained by developer Jaz, the platform\u2019s registered users increased from 6.18\u202fmillion 90\u202fdays ago to 10.85\u202fmillion 30\u202fdays ago, and is projected to reach 15\u202fmillion tomorrow.

The analysis covered more than 2.6\u202fmillion Bluesky posts that reference scholarly content between January\u202f2023 and July\u202f2025. In October\u202f2024 there were roughly 10\u202f000 posts, 3\u202f200 users and 6\u202f500 referenced articles; by November those numbers jumped to 239\u202f000 posts, 35\u202f000 users and 54\u202f000 articles, peaking in January\u202f2025 at 324\u202f000 posts by 45\u202f000 users referencing 71\u202f000 unique articles. Activity has since stabilized with a slight decline. \"The stabilization of posts, users and referenced articles suggests that Bluesky has already established itself as a credible and lasting platform for science communication, rather than a short\u2011lived trend,\" said Er\u2011Te Zheng, a Ph.D. student at Sheffield, via email. The study also found that 48\u202f% of scholarly posts received at least 10 likes and 34\u202f% were reposted at least 10 times, compared with only 3.9\u202f%\u20117.5\u202f% of X posts receiving more than 10 likes and 1.4\u202f%\u20114.4\u202f% receiving 10 reposts or more. In terms of originality, only 6.3\u202f% of Bluesky posts contained merely a research\u2011paper title, whereas on X title\u2011replication rates range from 11.8\u202f% to 92.4\u202f% across disciplines. Bluesky, with more than 38\u202fmillion users, remains far smaller than X, which Elon Musk claimed had about 600\u202fmillion monthly active users as of May\u202f2024. Nonetheless, a January poll by Nature found that more than half of 5\u202f300 respondents \u2013 most scientists \u2013 had left X, citing dissatisfaction with Musk\u2019s leadership and relaxed content moderation. \"This suggests that Bluesky users participate more actively and with greater originality in interactions around scholarly articles,\" Zheng added. The study highlights Bluesky\u2019s decentralized, open\u2011source network and its growing niche as a platform for deeper, more original scientific conversations than X.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 06:17 PM\nSource:[Observer](https://observer.com/2025/08/bluesky-x-science-engagement/)\n\n**Bluesky\u2019s European Outreach Campaign to Boost Growth**\nBluesky, a decentralized social network founded by Twitter co\u2011founder Jack Dorsey and now led by Jay Graeber, saw its user base jump from about 10\u202fmillion to nearly 38\u202fmillion after the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Growth has since slowed, prompting the company to launch a European outreach tour in August. Rose Wang, Bluesky\u2019s director of operations, acted as a marketing liaison to city halls across the continent. On 16\u202fJanuary\u202f2025, the Paris City Hall announced it had left Elon Musk\u2019s platform X, a move that Bluesky framed as a signal of shared values: 'Venir \u00e0 Paris est un signal que nous envoyons.' Wang highlighted that Bluesky offers higher engagement rates than larger platforms and positions itself as a democratic space that prohibits hate speech, harassment and misinformation: 'L'application est une comme une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique.' The campaign aims to position Bluesky as a tool for reconnecting municipalities and citizens, though uptake remains limited in some areas, such as Poitiers, which reportedly has only 311 residents.

Bluesky added a feature to combat identity theft and maintained its popularity, reaching over 30 million users, with 18-24 year olds being the most active users, according to Statista. To attract more users, Bluesky has released a new update with 'Activity Notifications' that allows users to control which notifications they receive. This feature enables users to activate a bell icon on a user's profile, receiving only new post and response notifications. Additionally, the update has expanded granular controls to decide which notifications to receive, such as likes, new followers, or other activities, and from whom.

In June 2025, Threads had 115.1 million daily active users, up 127.8% from the same period last year. X had 132 million daily active users, but this is a 15.2% decrease from the same period last year. Decentralized social network Bluesky is also growing rapidly, with a 372.5% increase in daily active users over the past year, but its audience is still relatively small, with 4.1 million daily active users. Bluesky's growth was fueled by users leaving X in protest of Elon Musk's association with Donald Trump, but the platform has since become criticized for being one-sidedly liberal, leading some users to return to Threads. Despite its potential, the competition is currently between Threads and X, with Threads being the main competitor to X for advertising budgets on mobile devices. However, on desktop, X has a significant advantage, with 145.8 million daily visits in June 2025, compared to Threads' 6.9 million. Bluesky is also growing in this segment, with 5.3 million daily visits. In the US, the situation is mixed, with Threads closing the gap with X on mobile devices, but X dominating on desktop. 'It's not just about the protest traffic, but about the interest in the technological approach: an open, customizable social network,' said analysts. 'Those who come only because it's 'not X' may quickly leave if the platform doesn't meet their expectations. Instead, the technical community may stay and support the development of the ecosystem.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 08, 2025 06:39 AM\nSource:[ITC.ua](https://itc.ua/news/threads-dogonyaet-x-na-smartfonah-audytoryy-pochty-sravnyalys/)\n\n**Threads Closes Gap with X in Mobile Users, But Still Trails on Web**\nMark Zuckerberg's social media platform, Threads, has reached 1.151 billion daily active users (DAU) on mobile, just 15 million short of Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter).

The gap between the two platforms has narrowed since Musk's close relationship with Donald Trump sparked a mass exodus of users from X. Threads is a text-based social media platform launched by Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in response to X. While X still dominates on the web, with 145.8 million daily web visitors, Threads has 6.9 million, a 20-fold difference. However, Threads has 3.5 billion global monthly active users (MAU), compared to X's 6 billion, according to Musk's claim last year.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts converge on a low probability that Bluesky will reach 100 million users before the end of 2025. Experts from technology adoption (Gartner Hype Cycle, S-Curve), product management, sociology, economics, and communication studies cite the same core dynamics: Bluesky\u2019s explosive growth following the post-2024-election exodus from X (Twitter) has sharply decelerated, with the user base plateauing around 38 million as of late September 2025. Absent a dramatic, exogenous event\u2014such as a major crisis or collapse at X or Threads, or a viral celebrity-driven migration\u2014the current trend suggests a plateau, with further growth expected to be incremental at best. Key risks and barriers identified include fierce competition from Meta\u2019s Threads, entrenched user bases and network effects on competing platforms, limited Bluesky resources, recent moderation controversies, polarization, and a value proposition still largely attractive only to a niche audience. While some experts allow for a slim possibility that a sudden, unforeseen shock could trigger another viral surge, this is not seen as the base case. Historical adoption rates of comparable social platforms, challenges in crossing from early adopters to mass market, and the daunting requirement of tripling user count in three months reinforce the consensus: the probability of Bluesky hitting 100 million users before the end of 2025 is assessed between 5% and 10%, with no expert rating it higher.",
