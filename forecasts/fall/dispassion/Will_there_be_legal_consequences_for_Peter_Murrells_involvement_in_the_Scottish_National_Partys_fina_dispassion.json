The focus on embezzlement, a well-defined crime with lower thresholds for conviction than, say, 'mismanagement' or regulatory breaches, increases risk. However, the UK and Scotland have a long record of complex, slow-moving political finance cases that result in acquittals, dropped charges, or procedural non-convictions, especially when the accused is well-connected and the case is politically sensitive.

While there is a non-trivial chance of acquittal or procedural delay, the combination of a formal charge, ongoing proceedings, and public attention suggests that a conviction is more likely than not if the evidence is as robust as the prosecution believes. Nonetheless, the probability should not be extreme given the historical base rate and legal hurdles.",

However, the most compelling arguments\u2014especially those grounded in base rates and the persistent difficulty of securing convictions in UK/Scottish political finance cases\u2014support a probability below 50%. Several defenses of low-to-moderate estimates (28%-38%) convincingly emphasize the weight of historical precedent, the high burden of proof, and the ambiguity between mismanagement and criminality. Critiques of higher forecasts stress the frequent collapse or acquittal in similar cases, even after formal charges. My own forecast (38%) is at the upper end of this lower cluster and is robustly supported by others' reasoning, particularly regarding the status quo bias and structural barriers to conviction. There is no new evidence or compelling argument to substantially increase or decrease my estimate, so I maintain my original probability.",

Starmer stated there was 'no misleading' in the run-up to the budget, which aimed to raise \u00a326 billion ($34 billion) in revenue to reduce borrowing, invest in infrastructure and public services, ease the cost of living, and stimulate economic growth. Three weeks before the budget, Reeves warned of a need for higher income taxes, breaking a key Labour election promise not to raise taxes on working people. This sparked backlash within her party, but after a better-than-expected fiscal update from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), she reversed course and opted for smaller tax increases. Opponents, including the Conservatives, Scottish National Party, and Reform U.K. leader Nigel Farage, called for investigations by the Financial Conduct Authority and the government's standards adviser. Reeves denied misleading anyone, stating that the OBR had confirmed a \u00a316 billion ($21 billion) shortfall in tax revenue due to a downgraded productivity forecast, which justified her call for increased contributions. Starmer, speaking at a London community center, asserted that the government inherited 'public finances and public services in total crisis' after 14 years of Conservative rule. He emphasized that the government had confronted reality, taken control of the nation's future, and is now 'back on track.' He also announced plans to cut the welfare bill and move closer to the European Union, noting that the 2020 Brexit exit deal had 'significantly hurt our economy' and that closer EU ties are essential for growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 02:28 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/news/uk-leader-keir-starmer-backs-his-treasury-chief-over-claims-she-misled-the-public-about-the-economy/)\n\n**The 5 words that explain why Rachel Reeves is accused of lying about the budget**\nRachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, is under scrutiny for claims she misled the public about the state of the nation's finances ahead of her November 2024 budget. Critics, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, allege Reeves misrepresented the fiscal situation by emphasizing a 'fiscal black hole' and warning of a productivity downturn, citing five key words from a 4 November speech: 'A less productive economy has consequences for the public finances too.' However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had informed Reeves as early as 17 September and again in October that a \u00a34.2bn surplus existed due to inflation and wage growth, which offset a \u00a316bn productivity-related tax shortfall. Despite this, Reeves maintained her budget tax rises\u2014amounting to \u00a326bn\u2014were necessary to build fiscal resilience, citing the need for headroom against fiscal rules and funding welfare reforms such as abolishing the two-child benefit cap and reversing winter fuel payment cuts. Badenoch called for her resignation, accusing Reeves of lying to justify tax hikes for political gain and to influence bond markets, stating such conduct would warrant jail time for a CEO. The Conservatives and SNP have urged the Financial Conduct Authority to investigate, while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called on Sir Laurie Magnus to examine potential breaches of the ministerial code. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has defended Reeves, stating there was 'no misleading' and that the initial fiscal challenge was real, though improved over time, allowing the government to avoid breaching its manifesto.

Starmer defended the UK government's fiscal policy, asserting that the budget's \u00a330 billion tax increase was based on a revised productivity assessment by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which revealed a \u00a316 billion shortfall compared to previous projections. He emphasized that commitments to protect the National Health Service (NHS), reduce debt costs, and combat the cost of living necessitated higher revenue, denying any deception. However, controversy intensified when the OBR unexpectedly released its 31 October letter to the Treasury, forecasting a \u00a34.2 billion surplus before budget measures\u2014contradicting prior claims of a fiscal crisis. 'The Telegraph' reported that Chancellor Rachel Reeves repeatedly claimed a fiscal 'hole' despite the OBR\u2019s contrary assessment. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch demanded Reeves' resignation, accusing her of misleading the public and making hard-working people poorer, while also labeling her 'without character, shame, and completely without direction.' Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called for a ministerial code investigation, alleging Reeves misrepresented fiscal conditions. The crisis deepened when 'The Times' reported that several cabinet ministers were misled, as Reeves had repeatedly warned of a dire fiscal situation in pre-budget meetings, including on 4 November, despite the OBR\u2019s surplus forecast. Starmer admitted, unusually, that he considered breaking his party\u2019s election manifesto, though he later confirmed it was possible to fulfill promises without doing so. He expressed pride in eliminating the two-child benefit cap, lifting over half a million children out of poverty, and raising the national minimum wage. Reeves denied lying, while Chief of Staff Darren Jones argued that cabinet-wide notifications are not required for every fiscal revision. The crisis has intensified internally, with ministers questioning communication strategy and a premature leak of the budget\u201452 minutes before its official launch\u2014adding further pressure.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 03:18 PM\nSource:[El Comercio](https://www.elcomercio.es/internacional/europa/starmer-defiende-presupuesto-peticiones-dimision-inflar-deuda-20251201161602-ntrc.html)\n\n**UK leader Keir Starmer backs his Treasury chief over claims she misled the public about the economy - Breitbart**\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended Treasury Chief Rachel Reeves against allegations that she misled the public and financial markets about the state of the UK's economy prior to the November 2025 tax-hiking budget.

She was questioned by BBC political reporter Laura Kuenssberg about her repeated warnings in November 2024 that economic productivity forecasts would be revised downward, which she said were based on early Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) data. However, the OBR later informed her in mid-September that public finances were stronger than previously thought, a fact she did not disclose publicly ahead of the budget. Reeves stated that fiscal headroom had decreased from \u00a39.9 billion in spring to \u00a34.2 billion in autumn, which she described as insufficient for a stable budget, and emphasized she increased headroom to \u00a321.7 billion to build resilience. She denied exaggerating the situation to justify a \u00a316 billion welfare increase, citing funding sources such as tax increases on online gambling, anti-tax evasion measures, and the removal of the two-child benefit cap. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch rejected Reeves\u2019 explanation, accusing her of creating a misleadingly pessimistic narrative to justify tax hikes and calling for her resignation. Badenoch claimed Reeves manipulated market expectations and suggested potential market abuse, prompting calls from the Conservative Party and the SNP for Reeves to appear before MPs. The Financial Conduct Authority and the independent adviser on ministerial ethics were also urged to investigate. Downing Street denied wrongdoing, and Keir Starmer is expected to support Reeves\u2019 budget decisions, stating they will ease cost-of-living pressures and reduce inflation. Reeves asserted she could be trusted, stating that failing to manage public finances responsibly would lead to higher interest rates, harming businesses and households.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 01:22 PM\nSource:[exbulletin.com](https://exbulletin.com/world/international/3123773/)\n\n**The 5 words that explain why Rachel Reeves is accused of lying about the budget**\nRachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, is under scrutiny for claims she misled the public about the state of the nation's finances ahead of her November 2024 budget.

Starmer insisted that the government\u2019s conclusions were based on the OBR\u2019s productivity review, which revealed a 16 billion pound shortfall, justifying the need for a 30 billion pound tax increase. He admitted that there was a moment when the government considered breaking its election manifesto, but ultimately concluded it could be fulfilled without doing so. Reeves denied lying, and her team argued that only affected ministries are involved in budget updates, not the full cabinet.

Starmer stated there was 'no misleading' in the run-up to Reeves\u2019 tax-hiking budget, which aimed to reduce government borrowing, invest in infrastructure and public services, ease the cost of living, and stimulate economic growth. Three weeks before the budget, Reeves had announced plans to raise income tax rates\u2014a move that broke Labour\u2019s 2024 election promise not to increase taxes on working people. After backlash from within her party and a better-than-expected update from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Reeves reversed course, opting for smaller revenue-raising measures. The Conservatives, Scottish National Party, and Reform U.K. have called for investigations by the Financial Conduct Authority and the government\u2019s standards adviser, alleging Reeves knew the OBR forecast was more favorable before her speech. Reeves denied misleading anyone, stating she accurately reported that the OBR downgrade had significantly impacted public finances and that this justified asking people to contribute more. She emphasized that the OBR had projected a 16 billion pound ($21 billion) shortfall due to a downgraded productivity forecast, a smaller gap than previously feared.

Sturgeon, Scotland's longest-serving first minister, is stepping down as an MSP in the May 2025 election after 27 years in frontline politics. Her tenure included overseeing Scotland's pandemic response, but she faced setbacks such as the blocked second independence referendum and gender reform legislation. Shortly after her resignation, the SNP was engulfed in scandal as police investigated its finances, leading to arrests of Sturgeon, her then-husband Peter Murrell, and former treasurer Colin Beattie. While no charges were brought against Sturgeon or Beattie, Murrell was later charged with embezzlement.

The donation was reportedly pledged in November, contingent on his selection, though Beattie denies any wrongdoing, stating he only assured members he would fund the campaign if chosen.

Nicola Sturgeon was also cleared, while her estranged husband Peter Murrell was charged with embezzlement.

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether Peter Murrell will face legal consequences (i.e., be convicted of a crime relating to SNP financial irregularities) are split, with estimated probabilities generally ranging from about 28% to 80%, and most commonly between 32% and 70%. All experts note that Murrell has been formally charged with embezzlement and appeared in court, a development that significantly elevates the probability of conviction above historic baselines for UK/Scottish political finance scandals, which rarely result in convictions for senior figures. \n\nKey factors increasing the probability of conviction include: the seriousness and specificity of the embezzlement charge; prosecutors' belief in the sufficiency of evidence to go to trial; the lengthy and focused police investigation; public and political pressure given the high-profile nature of the case. Factors decreasing the probability include: historically low base rates for convicting senior political party officials in the UK; the high burden of proof ('beyond reasonable doubt'), especially for financial crimes with complex, ambiguous evidence; previous exoneration of other key figures (e.g., Nicola Sturgeon and Colin Beattie); the robust and sometimes slow Scottish legal process; and the presence of plausible defences such as poor management rather than intent to defraud.\n\nThose with legal, prosecution, and corporate governance specializations lean toward a conviction being 'more likely than not' (final probabilities mostly in the 60\u201380% range), emphasizing the prosecutorial stage reached and public scrutiny. Experts in compliance, Scottish studies, or political science tend to be more cautious (probabilities closer to 30\u201340%, with the lowest at 28%), stressing the difficulty of securing convictions for political elites, the high evidentiary bar, and the prevalence of acquittals or dropped cases in such contexts.\n\nThere is broad agreement that a conviction is plausible, but far from certain given the complex and high-profile nature of the case, the legal standards involved, and historic precedent. Scenario analysis consistently cites that acquittal is likely if the prosecution cannot demonstrate clear intent and misuse of funds, while a conviction would require clear evidence of personal benefit or dishonesty tied directly to Murrell. The time left before resolution (over two years) is considered sufficient for the case to play out but allows for possible delays or procedural surprises.",
