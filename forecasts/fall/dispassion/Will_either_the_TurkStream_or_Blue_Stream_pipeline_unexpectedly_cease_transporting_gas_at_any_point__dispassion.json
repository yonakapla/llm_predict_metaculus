The most likely scenario remains that, despite continued attacks, any damage will be rapidly repaired and not meet the threshold for 'unexpected' cessation as defined by the resolution criteria.

However, all confirmed attacks with significant operational impact have so far been on oil infrastructure, not gas, and none have yet caused a sustained interruption to TurkStream or Blue Stream. Both pipelines are extremely high priorities for Russian and Turkish security services, given their sole status as remaining gas corridors and their strategic leverage: this makes successful attacks harder, but also increases their desirability as targets.\n\nRecent news confirms repeated Ukrainian attempts to strike TurkStream infrastructure, with Russian claims of drone interception and minor damage, but no reported outages. The technical resilience of gas pipelines and rapid repair capabilities further reduce the odds of a prolonged or widely reported outage. Nevertheless, the trend is toward higher risk: Ukrainian attacks are becoming more frequent, deeper, and bolder, and a single successful strike\u2014causing even a short, unexpected cessation\u2014would resolve this question as Yes. The requirement for the outage to be 'unexpected' and not due to maintenance or contract expiration is a crucial constraint.\n\nGiven the shrinking time window, the rising but still moderate base rate of such events, the increasing Ukrainian capability and intent, and the very high defensive priority of the pipelines, I assess the probability of an unexpected, attack-driven cessation of gas flow via either pipeline at any point in 2025 as moderately elevated but still less likely than not.",

Russian air defenses and rapid technical response contain any incidents to minor, quickly repaired damage. Economic and political incentives keep both sides focused on maintaining flows. Any supply interruptions are limited to scheduled maintenance or contractually-anticipated events, which do not qualify for a 'Yes' resolution.",
            "yes_scenario": "A Ukrainian drone or sabotage operation successfully strikes a critical above-ground facility (e.g., compressor station) on the Russian segment of TurkStream or Blue Stream, causing an unscheduled shutdown or an interruption not attributable to scheduled maintenance or contractual reasons. Alternatively, a cyberattack or a significant technical failure\u2014possibly induced by sabotage\u2014forces an unexpected halt in gas flows. Even a brief (hours or days) unscheduled stop would trigger a 'Yes' outcome under the question\u2019s criteria.",

However, the Ukraine war has created a new context: Ukraine has demonstrated the ability to hit Russian energy infrastructure far from the front lines (e.g., Chuvashia, Bashkortostan), and has attempted at least one attack specifically targeting TurkStream infrastructure. While none have succeeded so far, the frequency and range of attacks are increasing, and Western support for this campaign appears to be growing. That said, the pipelines remain extremely well-guarded, and their technical robustness\u2014especially for underwater or cross-border segments\u2014makes catastrophic damage difficult. Both Russia and Turkey have compelling reasons to prevent or rapidly mitigate disruptions, and Turkey has little interest in antagonizing Russia or risking its own energy security. The Blue Stream contract expiration is a non-factor unless something derails negotiations in an unscheduled, disorderly way. Weighing all factors, I judge the risk to be elevated compared to historical norms, but still below 50%. The likelihood of at least a brief, truly unexpected outage before Jan 1, 2026, is significant given the ongoing escalation\u2014but not the dominant scenario.",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nBoth pipelines are critical for energy security in Europe and Turkey, but they face challenges related to geopolitical tensions and contract expirations.&#x20;\n\nConcerning the TurkStream Pipeline, Russian gas supplies to Europe via TurkStream reached [a new](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/russian-gas-deliveries-via-turkstream-set-new-record-118255/) [all-time high](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/02/12/russian-gas-supplies-to-europe-via-turkstream-hit-new-all-time-high-in-january-a87962) in early 2025. This increase is partly due to Ukraine halting its transit of Russian gas to Europe on January 1, 2025, making TurkStream [the sole route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurkStream#Route) for Russian gas deliveries to Europe.\n\nFurther, Russia has accused Ukraine of attempting to attack the TurkStream pipeline on [multiple](https://energynews.pro/en/russia-accuses-ukraine-again-of-attacking-the-turkstream-pipeline/) [occasions](https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-repelled-ukrainian-drone-192450297.html). In March 2025, Russia [claimed](https://www.dailysabah.com/business/energy/russia-says-thwarted-ukrainian-drone-attack-on-turkstream-pipeline) to have intercepted drones targeting the pipeline, which it views as attempts to disrupt gas deliveries to Europe.&#x20;\n\nConcerning the Blue Stream pipeline, the major gas contract between Gazprom and Turkey for the pipeline [is set to expire](https://energynews.pro/en/turkey-facing-the-expiration-of-major-gas-contracts-in-2025-2026/) at the end of 2025. The Blue Stream pipeline is crucial for Turkey, providing about 60% of its Russian gas imports. However, occasional maintenance shutdowns and geopolitical tensions may pose challenges for Turkey's energy security.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36201,\"question_id\":35641}}`",

According to regional authorities, the strike caused only minor damage and posed no threat to the local population. The station, owned by Transneft\u2013Prikamye and part of the Almetyevsk\u2013Gorky trunk pipeline, contains six storage tanks with a total capacity of 120,000 cubic meters, as reported by the Moscow\u202fTimes. Ukrainian Commander\u2011in\u2011Chief Oleksandr\u202fSyrskyi said that over the past two months the Defense Forces have successfully hit 85 significant targets on Russian territory, 33 of which were strictly military and 52 were part of Russia\u2019s defense\u2011industrial complex. Syrskyi added that these operations have triggered a fuel crisis, directly affecting the military\u2019s logistics and supply. One such facility was the Afipsky oil refinery, attacked on September\u202f26, which processed about 6.25\u202fmillion tons of oil per year. Since early August, Ukraine has targeted Russian oil refining facilities, knocking out at least five major plants. Reuters reports that Russia\u2019s refining capacity has fallen 17\u202f% to 1.1\u202fmillion barrels per day, while Kommersant\u2019s sources say gasoline output is down about 10\u202f%. As a result, more than 300 gas stations have closed nationwide, and some regions have limited retail fuel sales to 10\u201320\u202fliters per customer. Exchange\u2011traded gasoline prices have risen 40\u201350\u202f% since the start of the year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u202fZelensky stated that U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump approved strikes on Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure and that Trump believes the attacks should follow an \u2018eye for an eye\u2019 principle.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 06:09 AM\nSource:[uawire.org](https://uawire.org/ukrainian-drone-strike-disrupts-operations-at-russian-oil-pumping-station-in-chuvashia)\n\n**Ukrainian Drone Attacks 'Friendship' Oil Pipeline Pump Station; Zelensky: Ukraine Will Implement Controlled Export of Non-Scarce Weapons; Latest Statements from Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers**\nAccording to the article, on 27 September 2025 a Ukrainian National Security Agency drone struck a pump station on Russia's 'Friendship' oil pipeline in the Chuvash Republic, causing a fire and halting oil transport. The article reports that Russian officials confirmed the attack but said it did not cause serious damage.

The attack, which occurred on 27\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, caused the pipeline to be closed for a short period. According to the article, the Chuvash Republic\u2019s president, Oleg\u202fNikolaev, posted on social media: 'Bug\u00fcn sabah, insans\u0131z hava ara\u00e7lar\u0131 kullanma giri\u015fimi kaydedildi.' The Russian Defence Ministry later reported that 55 drones were shot down during the night. The pipeline had also been struck on 9\u202fJune\u202f2025, leading to another temporary shutdown. Earlier, on 26\u202fSeptember\u202f2024, the Afipsky oil refinery in Krasnodar was hit by a similar drone attack; the resulting fire affected a 30\u2011square\u2011meter area and damaged one production unit, but no casualties were reported.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[T\u00fcrkiye](https://www.turkiyegazetesi.com.tr/dunya/kritik-enerji-hatti-vuruldu-karadenize-giden-petrol-borusu-devre-disi-1148877)\n\n**Ukraine's Oil Blitz Hits Putin**\nThe Telegraph reports that Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, pipelines and port terminals have caused a nationwide fuel shortage, higher prices, and government rationing of gasoline and diesel.  According to experts, the strikes cut oil processing by almost 20\u202f% on some days and disrupted exports from key ports, weakening Russia\u2019s ability to finance the war.  Fuel shortages have spread from the Far East to central Russia, including Moscow \u2013 the first time the capital has felt the impact of combat operations so close to civilian life.  Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak downplayed the situation, calling it a \u2018small deficit\u2019, but analysts say the drone attacks on domestic fuel supplies are severely affecting the population and businesses.  U.S. and EU pressure continues, with former President Donald Trump urging Europe to stop importing Russian energy and the EU accelerating its exit from Russian gas by the end of 2026.  Analysts argue that the attacks are among the most effective sanctions because they directly hit Russia\u2019s military budget.  \"The situation is not critical. Russia has enough oil and gas reserves and financial reserves to overcome this inconvenience, and the goal of conquering Ukraine is a much more valuable prize,\" said Emily\u202fFarris, RUSI analyst.  Recent drone strikes hit a pumping station in Chuvashia and the Afipsky refinery in Krasnodar Krai, the latter of which supplies diesel and gasoline to the Russian army.  \"On the domestic market, Ukrainian attacks have a large impact. Drones target facilities that supply internal fuel deliveries\u2026 across Russia there is a shortage, which further strains the already tense internal balance,\" said Luk\u202fVikenden, analyst at the Center for Energy and Clean Air.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 11:33 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u041d\u0406\u0410\u041d](https://www.unian.net/world/ataki-na-rossiyskie-npz-toplivnyy-krizis-porazil-putina-13144314.html)\n\n**Julia Lumumba Highlights Shared Values Between Russia and Africa Amid Ongoing Geopolitical Tensions**\nJulia Lumumba, daughter of Patrice Lumumba, visited Russia to celebrate the centenary of her father's birth and emphasised that the values for which he died\u2014freedom, justice, true economic and political independence, sovereignty and dignity\u2014are shared by both Russia and Africa.

The piece mentions a decision to limit non\u2011resident Russian citizens from transferring more than 1\u202fmillion\u202fUSD to foreign accounts, a restriction that will remain from 1\u202fOctober\u202f2025 to 31\u202fMarch\u202f2026.  It reports that Russia is a major supplier of gas, oil and refined products to Turkey, and that Turkish officials say it would be unprofitable to stop Russian supplies; the article quotes economist Igor Yushkov saying that a Turkish refusal would raise prices and benefit U.S. suppliers.  The article also covers U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for Turkey to drop Russian energy, the U.S. plan to double LNG exports, and the EU\u2019s accelerated ban on Russian LNG by 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2027.

It claims that the GUR destroyed four Mi\u20118 helicopters, two Be\u201112 amphibious aircraft and the radar system \"Neblo\u2011U\" in Crimea, making the region more vulnerable and requiring additional resources. The piece also states that the SBU\u2019s Special Operations (SSO) finished an episode with a S\u2011400 surface\u2011to\u2011air missile system in Kaluga, destroying its launch platform and radar. \n\nThe article then details recent attacks: two production\u2011dispatch stations on the \"Transnft\u2011Druzhba\" pipeline in Bryansk and the \"Samara\" station on the \"Kuybyshev\u2011Tikhoretsk\" pipeline, both hit by SBU drones. It also reports a strike on the Astara gas\u2011processing plant, a major global petrochemical complex, with damage that could halt operations for at least a week. \n\nA further attack on the \"Gazprom Neftogaz Salavat\" plant in Bashkortostan is described as the second strike in ten days, reaching a distance of 1,400 km and producing a visible plume of black smoke. The article claims this demonstrates the SBU\u2019s ability to hit targets across Russia, from the Baltic to the Ural. \n\nThe piece concludes by stating that Russia has had to raise VAT to 22% to cover war costs, implying that the attacks have forced the country to divert resources from investment to defense. The tone is strongly critical of the Russian government, labeling it as \"destroying what was built by generations\". \n\nKey metrics cited: 4 Mi\u20118 helicopters, 2 Be\u201112 aircraft, 1,400 km attack range, 22% VAT increase, 2\u2011month timeframe for significant damage to the gas sector.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 03:40 PM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/ru/think/chto-demonstrirujut-dronovye-sanktsii-sbu-1080421.html)\n\n**Hungary Accuses EU of Failing to Uphold Energy Guarantees**\nOn September 26, 2025, Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 accused the European Union of failing to uphold its obligations to defend Hungary\u2019s interests after attacks on the Druzhba pipeline. He said Budapest received no guarantees from the EU or Kyiv following the attacks attributed to Ukraine, according to the daily *Magyar Nemzet*. Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 stated, 'La Comisi\u00f3n Europea no intervino, no se puso de nuestro lado ni se dirigi\u00f3 a Ucrania sobre este problema.' He reminded that the EU had previously stressed the critical importance of energy infrastructure for member states and that Hungary views the attacks as a direct assault on national sovereignty. Analysts note that these remarks reflect growing tensions between Hungary and EU institutions. The Druzhba pipeline was disrupted in August after two missile and drone attacks, cutting supplies to Slovakia and Hungary. Both countries demanded Ukraine halt the attacks on critical energy infrastructure.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 02:18 PM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/09/26/acusa-hungria-a-ue-por-incumplir-garantias-energeticas/)\n\n**Kremlin: Intact Nord\u202fStream Pipeline Could Be Quickly Restored**\nOn Friday, the Kremlin announced that the remaining undamaged section of the Nord\u202fStream gas pipeline from Russia to Germany could be quickly restarted. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri\u202fPeskow told journalists, 'Die verbleibende Leitung ist vorhanden, sie kann im Grunde genommen sofort gestartet werden'. The Nord\u202fStream system consists of two double pipelines, Nord\u202fStream\u202f1 and Nord\u202fStream\u202f2, running under the Baltic Sea. After the 2022 explosions, only one of the four lines\u2014part of Nord\u202fStream\u202f2\u2014remained intact, a fact that the article cites as a metric of the damage. German Chancellor Friedrich\u202fMerz said in May that preventing Nord\u202fStream\u202f2 from operating is part of efforts to pressure Russia into ending the war in Ukraine. Peskow said Russia hopes for a conclusion of the German\u2011led investigation into the attacks. A Ukrainian citizen was arrested in Italy last month on suspicion of involvement. Russia blames Kyiv, while the Ukraine denies any role. Both Moscow and the West describe the September\u202f26,\u202f2022 explosions as sabotage that disrupted a large portion of Russian gas deliveries to Europe. Peskow reiterated on Friday that the United States was partly responsible, saying, 'Wer hat das, sagen wir, gebilligt? ... es ist offensichtlich, dass solche Handlungen der Ukraine und des Kiewer Regimes ohne das Wissen der Regierung von (Joe) Biden in den USA unm\u00f6glich gewesen w\u00e4ren'.

The loss of this route has already pushed gas prices to an all\u2011time high and contributed to inflation across the continent. President Vladimir Putin said last week that there was no time left this year to sign a new Ukrainian gas transit deal, blaming Kyiv for refusing to extend the agreement. Gazprom reported a net loss of $7\u202fbillion in 2023, its first annual loss since 1999, largely due to the loss of EU gas markets. The only remaining Russian pipelines to Europe are Blue\u202fStream and TurkStream to Turkey; other routes such as Yamal\u2011Europe and Nord\u202fStream are closed. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean ordered preparations for the possible nationalisation of Moldovagaz, which is 50\u202f% owned by Gazprom, after the company announced it would suspend exports to Moldova from 0500\u202fGMT on 1\u202fJanuary because of unpaid debts. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said Slovakia would consider reciprocal measures against Ukraine if the gas transit stops, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Fico of opening a \u2018second energy front\u2019 against Ukraine on the orders of Russia. Gazprom plans to send 42.4\u202fmillion cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Monday, a volume in line with recent days, but it assumes no further gas will flow after 31\u202fDecember in its 2025 internal planning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[EurActiv.com](https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/russian-gas-flows-via-ukraine-for-last-day-as-transit-deal-crumbles/)\n\n**Ukraine tried to attack TurkStream infrastructure in Russia, Moscow says | Euractiv**\nRussia's defence ministry said that on Monday it shot down nine Ukrainian drones that were attempting to attack a compressor station on the TurkStream gas pipeline in the Krasnodar region. The facility remained operational and there were 'no casualties', and the drones caused 'minor damage' to a gas metering station, which emergency teams repaired quickly. TurkStream, which carries Russian gas to Turkey and Europe via Bulgaria, is one of Russia's last remaining pipeline routes after Ukraine refused to renew a five\u2011year transit deal earlier this year. The incident follows earlier reports of Ukrainian involvement in attacks on other Russian pipeline infrastructure, including the 2022 explosions on Nord Stream 1 and 2, for which the CIA allegedly warned Belgian authorities.

The attack was confirmed by Slovak authorities. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world\u2019s longest energy networks, carries crude oil over 4,000\u202fkm (2,485\u202fmiles) from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland. It runs through Ukraine and is the main route for Russian crude deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure; the most recent attacks on Druzhba occurred on August\u202f13 and August\u202f18. Kiev confirmed it fired drones at a key distribution station in Russia\u2019s Bryansk Region, threatening supplies to Hungary and Slovakia. Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said the transfers would stop while the damage is investigated. In addition, Ukrainian forces have attacked the TurkStream pipeline, which supplies natural gas to Turkey and several European countries, and earlier this year struck a gas metering station near Sudzha. Hungary, which has maintained a neutral stance and refuses to supply weapons to Kiev, has called for peace and criticized Western sanctions as ineffective. The Kremlin has condemned Ukrainian attacks on civilian energy infrastructure as acts of terrorism.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 10:14 AM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/623409-ukraine-new-attack-oil-pipeline/)\n\n**Turkish Stream Pipeline Delivers 1.551 Billion Cubic Meters of Gas to European Market in July 2025**\nAccording to ENTSOG, the physical flow of gas through the Stranja-2/Malkochlar gas metering station on the border of Turkey and Bulgaria on August 3, 2025, was 47.93 million cubic meters.

    "summary": "Across perspectives including pipeline engineering, energy risk analysis, international relations, economics, and area studies, experts broadly agree that the risk of an unexpected cessation of gas transport via TurkStream or Blue Stream in 2025 is meaningfully elevated compared to historical, peacetime baselines, yet remains below 50%. Most analysts cite the sharp escalation in Ukrainian sabotage and drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure\u2014demonstrating both increasing capability and intent, with credible attempted attacks already reported on TurkStream. However, experts emphasize several factors mitigating this risk: Both pipelines are of the highest economic and geopolitical priority for Russia and Turkey (and, for TurkStream, also the EU), thus subject to heavy physical security, rapid-repair readiness, and strong political incentives to prevent or downplay disruptions. Robust design features, state-backed rapid repair, and information control further dampen the odds that an attack would result in a sustained or publicly-acknowledged interruption qualifying under the question\u2019s criteria. Scheduled maintenance and contract-related shutdowns (e.g., Blue Stream's year-end contract expiry) are excluded by the resolution criteria, narrowing the set of qualifying scenarios to unscheduled failures or attack-driven outages. Most experts anticipate that, although Ukrainian attacks will likely persist or escalate, Russian and Turkish defenses plus operational resilience make a large, truly unexpected and externally-reported shutdown less likely than continued operation\u2014but not negligible. Final probability estimates cluster between 19% and 38%, reflecting consensus around a moderate but not dominant risk by year-end 2025.",
