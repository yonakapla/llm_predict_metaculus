Thus, not only is legislative action unlikely, but the administrative pathway is structurally constrained as well. This reinforces the very low probability, and the forecast could be improved by making this explicit."

Their attention to the fine print in both the legislative summaries and the resolution criteria is well-placed: it underscores that only a clear, comprehensive statutory change would trigger a Yes outcome, not piecemeal or interpretive adjustments. This analysis is further supported by their recognition of the current political context, which is focused on retrenchment, not expansion or tightening, and by their correct reading that the recent bill makes no such change. Their scenario analysis is realistic and policy-relevant, making their forecast especially reliable for legal and practical purposes."

Their forecast also wisely incorporates the base rate for significant eligibility-tightening amendments, which is extremely low in a retrenchment-focused Congress, and their scenario analysis is well-calibrated to both the legal and political realities. Additionally, their explicit recognition that only a highly improbable legislative surprise could result in a 'Yes' outcome demonstrates appropriate epistemic humility.

Thus, the pathway for an administrative reinterpretation (even if attempted under political pressure) is not only politically but also legally closed without explicit statutory text. More explicit integration of this doctrinal shift would further strengthen your reasoning by underlining that the only legally durable route to a mandatory domestic content requirement for 45Y is a statutory amendment, which current legislative evidence makes highly unlikely."

The original question opened on 2025-04-10 18:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/36487). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which [expanded](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy) the production tax credits (PTC) for wind and geothermal-generated electricity to cover most renewable sources and extended them through 2032. The IRA also established a [domestic content bonus credit](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/irs-updates-ptc-and-itc-domestic-content-bonus-guidance) of up to 10% for projects whose steel/iron and a specific percentage of their components were made in the US.\n\nIn the wake of the 2024 US elections, Republicans took control of both Houses of Congress and the White House, with President Donald Trump [having expressed interest](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta/#the-ira-under-the-incoming-republican-white-house-and-congress) in reducing IRA spending. At the time of this question, congressional Republicans were working on a budget reconciliation bill to possibly enact tax and spending changes to the federal budget (see the Tax Foundation's updated [Budget Reconciliation tracker](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tax-cuts-2025-budget-reconciliation/)).\n\nIt is important to note that in the House of Representatives, the Republicans hold a slim majority of 220 to 213. In March 2025, a group of 21 Republican representatives [sent a letter](https://www.eenews.net/articles/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits/) to House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith to urge him to phase out rather than eliminate the clean energy incentives of the IRA. House Speaker Mike Johnson [told reporters](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5167829-johnson-inflation-reduction-act-ira-climate-tax-infrastructure/), in regard to repealing clean energy tax credits among other policies, \"It\u2019ll be somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.\" It's important to note, too, that reconciliation bills do not always succeed. In July 2017, for example, Senator John McCain famously [cast](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/senate-health-care-vote.html) a decisive No vote to a reconciliation bill that would have repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36487,\"question_id\":35922}}`",

Steven Horsford, Dina Titus, Susie Lee and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, issued a letter on October 20, 2025, criticizing a July 15, 2025, memo from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that requires his personal approval for every step of the federal permitting process for solar and wind projects. The letter argues the directive has effectively halted all new renewable energy projects nationwide, 'paralyzing hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, state and local tax revenue, and thousands of high-paying jobs.' Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, echoed these concerns in an August letter, stating that solar projects already deep in the permitting process were 'frozen' with no path forward. The Democrats assert that the policy undermines the Trump administration's stated goals of 'energy dominance' and lowering energy costs, calling it 'weaponization of the federal bureaucracy' to favor certain energy sources. The Interior Department defended the memo as strengthening accountability and preventing misuse of taxpayer subsidies. Nevada law mandates that 50% of energy sold by 2030 come from renewables, and the state expects over 130,000 megawatts of new generation capacity by 2030 to meet demand from data centers and mining. The solar industry currently supports about 30,000 jobs in Nevada\u2014more per capita than any other industry\u2014and has attracted $13.3 billion in investments. Rep. Horsford warned the policy risks grid reliability, raises energy bills, and puts the U.S. behind global competitors. Rep. Mark Amodei, Nevada\u2019s sole Republican in Congress, did not sign the letter, with his office stating it has been working directly with the Department of Interior on specific projects instead. The Interior Department responded by urging Congress to fund the government, referencing the ongoing federal shutdown.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 05:45 PM\nSource:[Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/energy/unnecessary-red-tape-is-derailing-nevadas-solar-industry-letter-argues-3510453/)\n\n**The battle over Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies**\nThe political standoff over the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits\u2014federal subsidies that reduce monthly insurance premiums\u2014has created significant uncertainty for millions of Americans ahead of the 2026 open enrollment period. These subsidies, expanded during the Biden administration through the 2021 American Rescue Plan and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, made health insurance more affordable for middle-income individuals, leading to ACA enrollment rising from approximately 12 million in 2021 to about 24 million in 2025, according to KFF. The enhanced subsidies are set to expire in January 2026, and Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue Congress has until early 2026 to decide, calling the timeline 'an eternity.' However, Senate Democrats, led by Senator Patty Murray, warn that premium increases are already being locked in, with letters sent to families in October 2025, and are withholding support for a stopgap funding bill to force action. This has led to a partial government shutdown. State insurance regulators, including those from both Republican and Democratic-led states, have urged Congress to act earlier, warning that failing to extend the credits would result in hundreds of dollars in additional monthly premiums for millions and could make coverage unaffordable for many. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) emphasized in an August letter that without extension, the stability and affordability of state health insurance markets would be severely threatened. Even if subsidies are eventually extended, delays will cause irreversible harm: consumers may lose coverage due to sticker shock, distrust in the system, and the perception that government programs are unreliable. Experts like Jeanne Lambrew of The Century Foundation caution that while extending subsidies would help, the damage from delay is already done. Premiums for 2026 are projected to rise by a median of 18%, up from 7% in 2025, driven by the expiration of expanded subsidies, the cost of GLP-1 drugs, and a potential shift to less comprehensive catastrophic plans. Open enrollment begins November 1, 2025, in most states, with a December 15 deadline for coverage starting January 1, 2026. In Idaho, enrollment starts October 15. ACA plans, sold through federal and state exchanges, are offered by private insurers like UnitedHealth, Blue Cross, and Kaiser Permanente, and are categorized into metal tiers (bronze, silver, gold, platinum) based on cost-sharing. While premium tax credits reduce monthly premiums, cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) lower out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles and copayments for low-income enrollees. Studies show that even with tools to compare plans, many consumers fail to take full advantage of available financial aid. A 2019 Covered California experiment found that notifying consumers about enhanced silver plans via email and mail increased enrollment in better-value plans by 22% compared to no notification. Despite the ACA's success in reducing the uninsured rate from 15% in 2012 to 8% in 2023, research shows that coverage instability remains high, with about 12% of the insured losing coverage within two years\u2014similar to pre-ACA levels\u2014highlighting persistent 'health insurance uncertainty.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 05:36 PM\nSource:[Journalist's Resource](https://journalistsresource.org/home/the-battle-over-affordable-care-act-insurance-subsidies-what-to-know-as-open-enrollment-looms/)\n\n**Working-class Americans Hit The Hardest If Shutdown Drags On With Affordable Healthcare At Stake**\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), known informally as Obamacare, has provided millions of Americans with access to affordable health coverage for the past 15 years, protecting over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions from being denied insurance. The law has faced persistent Republican opposition, with efforts to repeal or weaken it dating back to the Trump administration. In June 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R.1, the Budget Reconciliation Act of 2025 (the 'One Big Beautiful Bill'), which cuts funding for Medicaid and SNAP, increases defense and immigration enforcement spending, and prioritizes tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy\u2014while failing to extend enhanced ACA tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that H.R.1 will increase the national debt by $687 billion from 2025 to 2034 and push the cumulative deficit to $4.5 trillion. A federal government shutdown began two weeks prior due to a budget stalemate over the future of ACA tax credits, which expire at the end of December 2025. Democrats advocate for making the credits permanent, while Republicans oppose renewal, citing debt concerns. In 2025, over 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplaces, with 90% receiving federal tax credits that reduced their premiums. The enhanced credits, introduced in 2021 and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act, lowered average premiums by 44%. Without renewal, the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) estimates that average premiums could rise by 114%\u2014potentially doubling\u2014for some, forcing at least 4 million people to become uninsured. The CBO warns that 1.5 million people may forgo coverage due to 'sticker shock' even if credits are restored later. Over 75% of ACA enrollees live in states won by President Trump in 2024, and in states that did not expand Medicaid\u2014such as Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Texas\u2014marketplace enrollment has tripled since the ACA's inception. Nearly 90% of enrollees earn below four times the federal poverty level, with half earning less than twice the poverty level, highlighting the ACA\u2019s critical role for working-class Americans. Public support for extending tax credits is strong: 78% of Americans favor continuation, including 59% of Republicans and 57% of MAGA supporters. In September 2025, 11 GOP House members backed H.R. 5145, a bipartisan bill to extend credits through 2026, though it has not yet been voted on.

Supporters, including Rep. Brett Guthrie and Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, claim the bill advances domestic energy production by expanding oil and gas leasing\u2014particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, onshore, and Alaska\u2014and creating the Energy Dominance Financing program. However, critics, including Dan O\u2019Brien of Energy Innovation, argue the bill undermines long-term energy dominance by cutting incentives for wind and solar projects. O\u2019Brien\u2019s analysis shows the bill could result in a loss of 344 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity\u2014equivalent to the electricity use of 100 million homes\u2014reducing expected U.S. electricity generation by about one-third over the next decade. This loss, he warns, will force older, more expensive power plants to run more frequently, driving up household energy costs by over $280 annually by 2035\u2014a 13% increase. Experts like Samantha Gross of the Brookings Institution and Adam Hersh of the Economic Policy Institute argue the bill prioritizes fossil fuels at the expense of renewable energy, harming both domestic affordability and global leadership in clean energy. Gross notes that the U.S. risks ceding technological leadership to China, while Hersh calls the bill the 'Energy Inflation Act' due to its projected cost increases. Cullen Hendrix of the Peterson Institute for International Economics acknowledges the bill advances fossil fuel output but warns it sidelines the growing renewable sector, resulting in a 'net-negative' outcome. Despite the setbacks, Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners suggests that economic drivers for renewables remain strong, and the transition may be slowed but not halted. The article concludes that while the OBBB reshapes U.S. energy policy, its long-term impacts remain uncertain and may be offset by future regulatory or legislative developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 08:50 AM\nSource:[insideclimatenews.org](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16072025/wind-solar-cuts-could-affect-gop-energy-dominance-promise/)\n\n**Corporate Media Admits Many Democrats Have Finally Given Up Shoving Climate Messaging Down Americans' Throats**\nSeveral corporate media outlets and Democratic lawmakers have shifted their focus from climate change messaging to rising electricity prices, reflecting a strategic pivot in response to public sentiment. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll, most Americans did not prioritize climate policy heading into the 2024 election. Democratic leaders such as Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii stated, 'The way to victory is to talk about price,' arguing that climate rhetoric often makes voters feel disconnected. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware blamed rising energy costs on President Donald Trump in an October 1 op-ed, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse have emphasized electricity price increases under Trump. However, electricity costs were already rising under President Joe Biden due to green energy transitions, data center demand, and aging infrastructure. The Green New Deal has not been reintroduced in the current legislative session, and congressional Democrats have scarcely referenced it, according to Axios data. Former Biden and Obama-era officials told Politico in June that Democrats have 'lost the culture war on climate' and must adopt a new strategy to avoid being seen as a 'niche leftist movement.' Marc Morano of ClimateDepot.com claimed Democrats have 'zero interest' in climate fears, attributing this shift to public fatigue with 'virtue signaling' and the 'Trump Effect' dampening global climate advocacy. The article was published by The Daily Caller News Foundation on October 20, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 07:08 PM\nSource:[The Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2025/10/20/corporate-media-starting-realize-leftists-lost-climate/)\n\n**'Unnecessary red tape' is derailing Nevada's solar industry, letter argues**\nNevada's congressional delegation, including Reps. Steven Horsford, Dina Titus, Susie Lee and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, issued a letter on October 20, 2025, criticizing a July 15, 2025, memo from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that requires his personal approval for every step of the federal permitting process for solar and wind projects. The letter argues the directive has effectively halted all new renewable energy projects nationwide, 'paralyzing hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, state and local tax revenue, and thousands of high-paying jobs.' Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, echoed these concerns in an August letter, stating that solar projects already deep in the permitting process were 'frozen' with no path forward. The Democrats assert that the policy undermines the Trump administration's stated goals of 'energy dominance' and lowering energy costs, calling it 'weaponization of the federal bureaucracy' to favor certain energy sources. The Interior Department defended the memo as strengthening accountability and preventing misuse of taxpayer subsidies. Nevada law mandates that 50% of energy sold by 2030 come from renewables, and the state expects over 130,000 megawatts of new generation capacity by 2030 to meet demand from data centers and mining. The solar industry currently supports about 30,000 jobs in Nevada\u2014more per capita than any other industry\u2014and has attracted $13.3 billion in investments. Rep. Horsford warned the policy risks grid reliability, raises energy bills, and puts the U.S. behind global competitors. Rep. Mark Amodei, Nevada\u2019s sole Republican in Congress, did not sign the letter, with his office stating it has been working directly with the Department of Interior on specific projects instead. The Interior Department responded by urging Congress to fund the government, referencing the ongoing federal shutdown.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 05:45 PM\nSource:[Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/energy/unnecessary-red-tape-is-derailing-nevadas-solar-industry-letter-argues-3510453/)\n\n**US Congressional Budget Office: Exception Rule for Orphan Drugs Could Increase Costs of 'Big Beautiful Bill' by $6 Billion**\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) stated on Monday that new exception rules for price negotiations on several high-revenue cancer drugs under President Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' could increase federal spending by up to $6 billion over the next decade. The updated estimate reflects new information about the negotiation power of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Darzalex, Merck\u2019s Keytruda, and Bristol Myers\u2019 Opdivo. The law, part of the annual appropriations bill, exempts drugs from the negotiation program if they hold multiple orphan drug designations or have approval for non-orphan indications\u2014expanding the prior rule that only excluded drugs with a single rare disease designation. The CBO had previously estimated the cost increase at $4.9 billion by 2034; now, including additional drugs, the projected cost ranges from $6.7 to $10.9 billion, depending on how the government treats new formulations. The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, allowed Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most expensive drugs covering 66 million people. The CBO previously estimated that these price negotiation rules would save $98.5 billion over the first ten years (2022\u20132031). The agency noted that its current estimate does not yet include the September 2025 updated guidelines from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which modify how Medicare Advantage spending will be factored into future drug ranking lists for price negotiations.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 05:39 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/us-kongressamt-ausnahmeregelung-fuer-orphan-drugs-koennte-kosten-des-big-beautiful-bill-um-6-milli-ce7d5ad2d188f324)\n\n**The battle over Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies**\nThe political standoff over the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits\u2014federal subsidies that reduce monthly insurance premiums\u2014has created significant uncertainty for millions of Americans ahead of the 2026 open enrollment period. These subsidies, expanded during the Biden administration through the 2021 American Rescue Plan and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, made health insurance more affordable for middle-income individuals, leading to ACA enrollment rising from approximately 12 million in 2021 to about 24 million in 2025, according to KFF. The enhanced subsidies are set to expire in January 2026, and Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue Congress has until early 2026 to decide, calling the timeline 'an eternity.' However, Senate Democrats, led by Senator Patty Murray, warn that premium increases are already being locked in, with letters sent to families in October 2025, and are withholding support for a stopgap funding bill to force action. This has led to a partial government shutdown. State insurance regulators, including those from both Republican and Democratic-led states, have urged Congress to act earlier, warning that failing to extend the credits would result in hundreds of dollars in additional monthly premiums for millions and could make coverage unaffordable for many. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) emphasized in an August letter that without extension, the stability and affordability of state health insurance markets would be severely threatened. Even if subsidies are eventually extended, delays will cause irreversible harm: consumers may lose coverage due to sticker shock, distrust in the system, and the perception that government programs are unreliable. Experts like Jeanne Lambrew of The Century Foundation caution that while extending subsidies would help, the damage from delay is already done. Premiums for 2026 are projected to rise by a median of 18%, up from 7% in 2025, driven by the expiration of expanded subsidies, the cost of GLP-1 drugs, and a potential shift to less comprehensive catastrophic plans. Open enrollment begins November 1, 2025, in most states, with a December 15 deadline for coverage starting January 1, 2026. In Idaho, enrollment starts October 15. ACA plans, sold through federal and state exchanges, are offered by private insurers like UnitedHealth, Blue Cross, and Kaiser Permanente, and are categorized into metal tiers (bronze, silver, gold, platinum) based on cost-sharing. While premium tax credits reduce monthly premiums, cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) lower out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles and copayments for low-income enrollees. Studies show that even with tools to compare plans, many consumers fail to take full advantage of available financial aid. A 2019 Covered California experiment found that notifying consumers about enhanced silver plans via email and mail increased enrollment in better-value plans by 22% compared to no notification. Despite the ACA's success in reducing the uninsured rate from 15% in 2012 to 8% in 2023, research shows that coverage instability remains high, with about 12% of the insured losing coverage within two years\u2014similar to pre-ACA levels\u2014highlighting persistent 'health insurance uncertainty.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 05:36 PM\nSource:[Journalist's Resource](https://journalistsresource.org/home/the-battle-over-affordable-care-act-insurance-subsidies-what-to-know-as-open-enrollment-looms/)\n\n**Greene: GOP will lose House if it doesn't tackle cost of living**\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) warned that the Republican Party risks losing control of the House in the 2026 midterms if the cost of living does not decrease, stating in an interview with Semafor that 'Republicans will lose the House if Americans are continuing to go paycheck-to-paycheck.' She emphasized that voters will evaluate the election through the lens of their financial struggles. In response, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) expressed confidence in a Republican majority, claiming he is 'very bullish about the midterms' and believes Republicans will grow their House majority and retain the Senate, enabling President Trump to serve four years. Johnson defended the GOP's approach, asserting that the House 'did its job' by passing a GOP-backed funding bill on Sept. 19 and advocating for a 'clean' continuing resolution. However, Greene criticized Johnson for keeping the House out of session during the ongoing government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, calling it a failure to act and stating she has 'no respect for the decision to refuse to work.' She also highlighted a lack of GOP conference calls on health care and criticized the party for not having a plan to address projected health insurance premium increases\u2014over 100% for millions\u2014if Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits expire. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, household debt rose by $185 billion in the second quarter of 2025, with mortgage and credit card balances increasing by $131 billion and $27 billion, respectively. Since 2019, total household debt has increased by $4.24 trillion. Johnson acknowledged a 'thoughtful conservation' with Greene but emphasized the need for consensus in a large legislative body. Greene, however, said there is 'intense frustration within our conference' and declared, 'The Republican Party is failing.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 03:53 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5563347-marjorie-taylor-greene-gop-midterms-cost-of-living/)\n\n**Working-class Americans Hit The Hardest If Shutdown Drags On With Affordable Healthcare At Stake**\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), known informally as Obamacare, has provided millions of Americans with access to affordable health coverage for the past 15 years, protecting over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions from being denied insurance. The law has faced persistent Republican opposition, with efforts to repeal or weaken it dating back to the Trump administration. In June 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R.1, the Budget Reconciliation Act of 2025 (the 'One Big Beautiful Bill'), which cuts funding for Medicaid and SNAP, increases defense and immigration enforcement spending, and prioritizes tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy\u2014while failing to extend enhanced ACA tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that H.R.1 will increase the national debt by $687 billion from 2025 to 2034 and push the cumulative deficit to $4.5 trillion. A federal government shutdown began two weeks prior due to a budget stalemate over the future of ACA tax credits, which expire at the end of December 2025. Democrats advocate for making the credits permanent, while Republicans oppose renewal, citing debt concerns. In 2025, over 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplaces, with 90% receiving federal tax credits that reduced their premiums. The enhanced credits, introduced in 2021 and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act, lowered average premiums by 44%. Without renewal, the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) estimates that average premiums could rise by 114%\u2014potentially doubling\u2014for some, forcing at least 4 million people to become uninsured. The CBO warns that 1.5 million people may forgo coverage due to 'sticker shock' even if credits are restored later. Over 75% of ACA enrollees live in states won by President Trump in 2024, and in states that did not expand Medicaid\u2014such as Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Texas\u2014marketplace enrollment has tripled since the ACA's inception. Nearly 90% of enrollees earn below four times the federal poverty level, with half earning less than twice the poverty level, highlighting the ACA\u2019s critical role for working-class Americans. Public support for extending tax credits is strong: 78% of Americans favor continuation, including 59% of Republicans and 57% of MAGA supporters. In September 2025, 11 GOP House members backed H.R. 5145, a bipartisan bill to extend credits through 2026, though it has not yet been voted on. GOP leader Marjorie Taylor Greene stated on X, 'I'm absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year.'

The bill, backed by MAGA-aligned forces and supported by Representative Gabe Evans, eliminates clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, jeopardizing solar and wind projects that were expected to qualify only if initiated within 60 days of the bill\u2019s passage\u2014by mid-September 2025. This change threatens future energy expansion and may lead to higher electricity rates, undermining prior efforts to keep utility costs low. The legislation also cuts Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, programs widely supported across party lines, and increases funding for immigration enforcement: $45 billion for detention facilities, $14 billion for deportations, and billions to hire 10,000 additional ICE agents by 2029, raising concerns about lowered hiring standards and racial profiling. Guevara emphasizes that these policies create real fear among families\u2014parents avoid school, students live in anxiety, and workers face exploitation. He attributes Evans\u2019 vote to Trump\u2019s endorsement during his 2025 reelection campaign, accusing him of prioritizing political loyalty over constituents\u2019 well-being.

It cites a Penn Wharton study that estimated the IRA\u2019s clean\u2011vehicle provisions would cost $393\u202fbillion between 2023 and 2032, making them a target for spending cuts. The piece argues that the credits were doomed from the start because Americans dislike being told what to buy, the rules were overly complex, and the credits mainly benefited high\u2011income buyers \u2013 a point echoed by a Republican National Committee fact sheet that called them \u2018a giveaway to the rich.\u2019 It also notes that the credits were introduced during the Bush administration, expanded under Biden to spur domestic EV manufacturing and compete with China, but were ultimately killed by Trump and a Republican\u2011controlled Congress. The article includes quotes such as \u2018The U.S. consumer is really different,\u2019 said Raul Arredondo, and \u2018It\u2019s not just, \u2018OK, here\u2019s a tax credit.\u2019 It\u2019s, \u2018Here\u2019s a tax credit, and then here\u2019s 100,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations\u2026\u2019 said Chad Cummings, to illustrate consumer attitudes and regulatory complexity.

Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), which aims to overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to accelerate federal environmental reviews for energy projects. The current permitting process takes an average of 4.5 years for energy projects and 7.5 years for transmission projects, according to the American Clean Power Association (ACP). Both renewable and fossil fuel industry groups, including ACP and the American Petroleum Institute (API), have supported the bill, citing the need for faster project approvals to meet growing energy demand and strengthen national energy security. However, environmental groups and progressive lawmakers, including Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) and Rep. Emily Randall (D-Wash.), express skepticism, arguing that the bill fails to address systemic issues like underfunded federal agencies and staff shortages. Critics such as Marlyn Twitchell of the Western Environmental Law Center warn the bill could disproportionately benefit fossil fuel projects, especially given the Trump administration\u2019s recent actions halting and issuing stop-work orders for offshore wind projects. Jarryd Page of the Environmental Law Institute and Stephen Schima of Earthjustice emphasize that existing legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Fiscal Responsibility Act already provided funding and deadlines to speed up reviews, but these gains are now threatened by Republican efforts to cut federal staffing and rescind funding. Westerman responded by suggesting AI could reduce the need for human staff in permitting.

The Act eliminates the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, unless they are 'placed in service' by December 31, 2027. The Act also phases out the PTC and ITC for battery, hydropower, geothermal, and other electricity-generating projects with zero lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, unless they begin construction before 2034. Additionally, the Act prohibits tax credits for projects that receive material assistance from 'foreign entities of concern' (FEOCs) and other 'prohibited foreign entities.' The Executive Order directs the Department of the Treasury to review the safe harbor rules for determining whether a solar or wind project has 'begun construction' for U.S. federal income tax purposes, creating potential uncertainty for solar and wind project developers. The Act preserves the ability of taxpayers to sell PTCs and ITCs, but imposes new limitations on the transfer of credits to certain foreign entities. The Act also extends the 45Z credit for sales of sustainable aviation fuel and other clean transportation fuels through 2029, but imposes a new requirement that fuel produced after 2025 be 'exclusively' derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Furthermore, the Act accelerates the sunset of several other credits relating to electric vehicles and their related infrastructure, and imposes new limits on the ability of taxpayers to 'stack' the Code Section 45X credit.

The bill includes numerous tax reform provisions, particularly affecting tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ('IRA'). Key changes include: projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years for offshore wind); residential solar electric property would not be subject to the rule above; and the fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance would no longer be necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate. The bill also imposes FEOC rules to tax credit qualification, introducing an additional layer of complexity.

The bill includes several changes to the renewable energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Key changes include: the clean electricity tax credits will be unavailable for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, but a grandfather rule will preserve eligibility for projects that start construction before December 31, 2028; the prohibition on using nuclear fuel sourced from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea has been removed; a new excise tax on wind and solar projects that violate material assistance rules has been excluded; the clean fuel production credit under IRC \u00a7 45Z has been extended through 2029 and will only be available for fuel produced from feedstocks produced in the United States, Mexico, and Canada; and the clean hydrogen production credit under IRC \u00a7 45V will be sunsetted for hydrogen projects that have not yet commenced by December 31, 2027. 'The BBB provides some additional stability for the renewable fuels market, but will cause some disruption in the sustainable aviation fuel and imported feedstock markets,' according to industry participants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 07, 2025 07:33 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/congress-sends-big-beautiful-bill-for-1748708/)\n\n**Renewable Energy Update 7.3.25**\nThe Republican budget megabill, which makes significant cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy tax credits, has passed both houses of Congress and is now headed to President Donald Trump's desk. The bill restricts the ability of projects to qualify for certain clean energy credits, shortens the timeline for those credits, and ends several electric vehicle credits after September 30. While clean energy advocates and congressional Democrats argue that the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits, some Republicans wanted to see more significant cuts. 'The final version of the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits,' said congressional Democrats, although no specific quote from a Democrat is provided in the article. The bill passed the House 218-214 on Thursday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 07, 2025 01:32 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/renewable-energy-update-7-3-25-4361953/)\n\n**US Wind and Solar Industries Receive Relief with Passage of 'Big and Beautiful' Bill**\nThe US has passed a significant tax and spending bill, known as the 'big and beautiful' bill, which has been a topic of controversy. The bill, signed by President Trump on July 4, removes the tax on wind and solar projects that was previously proposed. The final version of the bill also removes the additional tax on 'restricted foreign entities' (FEOC) participating in projects. The bill's passage brings short-term relief to the wind and solar industries. Christian Roselund, a senior analyst at ROTH, said, 'If the final version becomes law, projects can start construction before the end of 2026 and enjoy a 4-year window of 100% ITC/PTC support.' Philip Shen, a senior analyst at ROTH, also confirmed that 'if the final version becomes law, projects can start construction before the end of 2026 and enjoy a 4-year window of 100% ITC/PTC support, which will avoid a massive cliff in project volume in 2028.' The bill's adjustments include: ITC/PTC time limits set, 45X encourages integrated manufacturing. Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), shared a detailed explanation of the bill on LinkedIn, including: Solar consumption tax: solar projects no longer add consumption tax; 25D clause: residential solar tax credit will no longer apply after December 31, 2025; 45Y/48E clause: solar facilities that start construction within 12 months after the law takes effect must be operational by December 31, 2027 to receive tax credits; this does not apply to energy storage projects; Domestic content incentive: repair the IRA's 48E clause domestic content bonus tax credit drafting error, projects starting construction on or after June 16, 2025, must meet a 45% domestic content requirement and will increase annually; 45X clause update: component integrated production must be completed in the same factory, and the final product must be sold to an unrelated third party, with at least 65% of material costs sourced from domestic US; redefine the concept of 'battery module'; key mineral incentive will be gradually phased out starting from 2031; FEOC restriction: from the effective date of the law, restricted foreign entities and foreign-influenced companies will no longer be eligible for 45Y/48E/45X tax credits. For projects starting construction in 2026 and selling qualified components, they may not receive 'substantial assistance' from FEOC.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: July 07, 2025 01:57 AM\nSource:[\u5317\u6781\u661f\u7535\u529b\u7f51](https://guangfu.bjx.com.cn/news/20250707/1449773.shtml)\n\n**Amendments to IRA Tax Credits in Congressional Budget Bill**\nThe House of Representatives passed the budget reconciliation bill (H.R. 1, the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act') on July 3, 2025, with a vote of 218-214. The bill now goes to the President for signature. The bill contains amendments to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ('IRA') tax credits, including changes to the eligibility requirements for tax credits under sections 45 and 48. The bill accelerates the expiration of tax credits for wind and solar projects, requiring them to be placed in service by December 31, 2027. Additionally, the bill imposes Foreign Entity Ownership Control (FEOC) requirements on tax credits under sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X. The bill also codifies the definition of 'beginning of construction' for tax purposes and requires the Treasury Department to issue guidance on new threshold percentages for critical minerals by December 31, 2027. The imposition of FEOC rules introduces an additional layer of complexity to tax credit qualification.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 04, 2025 02:19 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/amendments-to-ira-tax-credits-in-6600090/)\n\n**Renewable Energy Tax Credits in the Big, Beautiful Bill: Final Status**\nThe Big, Beautiful Bill (BBB) has been approved by Congress and is expected to be signed into law by President Trump on July 4, 2025. The bill includes several changes to the renewable energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Notably, the clean electricity tax credits (IRC \u00a7\u00a7 45Y and 48E) will be unavailable for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, but a grandfather rule will preserve eligibility for projects that start construction before the date that is 12 months following enactment of the Bill. The prohibition on using imported nuclear fuel under IRC \u00a7 45U has been removed, and the new excise tax applicable to wind and solar projects that violate the material assistance rules has been excluded from the final version of the BBB. The clean fuel production credit under IRC \u00a7 45Z has been extended through the end of 2029, and the credit will only be available for fuel produced from feedstocks produced in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The value of the IRC \u00a7 45Z credit has been capped at $1.00 per gallon, except in the case of fuel produced from animal manure. The clean hydrogen production credit under IRC \u00a7 45V will be sunsetted for hydrogen projects that have not yet commenced by December 31, 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 11:17 PM\nSource:[Pillsbury Law](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/renewable-energy-tax-credits-big-beautiful-bill-IRA.html)\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act Would Significantly Expand Federal Income Tax Benefits for Green Technology Industry**\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expands federal income\u2011tax benefits for green\u2011technology projects.  It extends the existing Section\u202f45 PTC and Section\u202f48 ITC for wind and solar facilities, adds the PTC to new solar projects, and removes sunset provisions for facilities placed in service after\u202f2021.  The Act introduces a new Section\u202f45Y clean\u2011electricity production credit (CEPTC) and a Section\u202f48D clean\u2011electricity investment credit (CEITC) that apply to any renewable or energy\u2011storage facility that begins construction after\u202f2025, with rates tied to a 0\u202f% greenhouse\u2011gas\u2011emissions standard.  Energy\u2011storage facilities gain an election out of the public\u2011utility property limitation and are treated as five\u2011year property under MACRS.  The Act also expands the ITC/PTC to energy\u2011storage, biogas, microgrid controller equipment, and provides a separate PTC for electricity used to produce clean hydrogen under Section\u202f45V.  Wage\u2011and\u2011apprenticeship standards can trigger an 80\u202f% credit haircut, while meeting domestic\u2011content or energy\u2011community standards can add a 10\u202f% (or 20\u202f% for low\u2011income communities) credit enhancement.  The Section\u202f45Q carbon\u2011capture credit is extended to facilities beginning construction before\u202f2033, with a higher rate for direct\u2011air\u2011capture.  Fuel\u2011production credits are extended through\u202f2024 and a new Section\u202f45Z clean\u2011fuel credit is introduced for 2025\u20112027.  The dormant Section\u202f48C investment credit is revived for advanced\u2011energy production and manufacturing, with a $10\u202fbillion ceiling.  The Act creates refundable credits for tax\u2011exempt entities, allows sale of refundable credits, and changes carry\u2011over rules to a 3\u2011year carryback and 22\u2011year carryforward.  These provisions aim to streamline compliance, incentivize domestic content, and broaden financing options for green projects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 04, 2022 12:00 AM\nSource:[morganlewis.com](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/08/inflation-reduction-act-would-significantly-expand-federal-income-tax-benefits-for-green-technology-industry)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is overwhelming consensus that the probability of domestic content requirements becoming mandatory for obtaining the IRA's 45Y Production Tax Credits (PTC) before January 1, 2026, is extremely low. Experts from fields spanning energy policy, tax law, public policy, government relations, statutory interpretation, administrative law, and political science each point to key factors that decrease the likelihood of this outcome. \n\nMajor Recent Legislation: All experts cite the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' (OBBB), signed into law in July 2025 with Republican control of Congress and the White House, as focusing on sunsetting, restricting, or phasing out clean energy tax credits\u2014including accelerated phaseouts, FEOC (foreign entity of concern) restrictions, and tighter qualification rules\u2014without making domestic content requirements mandatory for 45Y PTC. Experts uniformly agree that neither legislative text nor supporting legal and industry analyses indicate a move to make the domestic content bonus a universal prerequisite for the PTC.\n\nPolitical Environment: All agree the current political context under unified GOP government is aimed at rolling back or eliminating clean energy subsidies, rather than tightening them via new requirements. There is intra-party division between phasing out and outright repeal, but no evidence of support for adding stricter mandates.\n\nAdministrative and Regulatory Actions: Recent IRS and Treasury guidance has focused on compliance, phaseouts, and foreign content restrictions\u2014without mandating domestic content as a baseline condition for PTC eligibility. Regulatory inertia and agency discretion are not expected to override the statutory framework.\n\nInterest Groups and Industry: Strong industry pushback against stricter requirements, combined with bipartisan concerns about job losses and project viability, have blocked momentum toward making domestic content a universal requirement. Interest group theory and policy feedback effects suggest that midstream tightening is politically costly and rare.\n\nBase Rates and Legislative Precedent: All experts emphasize that, historically, bonus criteria for tax credits are rarely converted to mandatory requirements, especially in a retrenchment environment. Last-minute legislative surprises are theoretically possible but highly improbable, given the legislative timetable and current gridlock.\n\nNo plausible Yes scenario is supported by news, legislative summaries, or regulatory releases. Every expert estimates the probability of a Yes outcome as between 2% and 4%, citing as the only path a highly unlikely, rapid legislative maneuver before the resolution deadline. The status quo is expected to persist, with domestic content remaining an elective bonus requirement for 45Y credits.\n\nIn summary: All available legislative, political, regulatory, and industry evidence supports a near-zero probability that domestic content requirements will become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's 45Y Production Tax Credits by January 1, 2026.",
