The transfer of functions and hollowing out increase the risk, but absent a clear, unblocked executive action or a Congressional act before Jan 1, the base rate for outright elimination of such a program in so short a window is low.

The continued funding\u2014even if at a reduced level\u2014and the persistence of a PMI-branded mission or budget line, however nominal, reinforce the most likely outcome: PMI limps on in a diminished but technically extant form. Therefore, I see no reason to revise my probability from 20%.",

Thanks to the bipartisan support of Congress and the generosity of the American people, PMI now works in 27 partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa and three programs in the Greater Mekong Subregion in Southeast Asia\u2013representing about 90% of the global malaria burden.\n\nAt the time of this question, its [website](https://www.pmi.gov/) showed the following error message:&#x20;\n\n![](https://cdn.metaculus.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2025-02-23_at_8.31.12%C3%A2PM.png)\n\nCreated in 2005 [under President George W.

Trump signed Executive Order 14169 Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid, which [targeted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14169#USAID) in particular USAID, which operates the PMI program.\n\nAccording to the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-status-of-president-trumps-pause-of-foreign-aid-and-implications-for-pepfar-and-other-global-health-programs):\n\n> Despite the emergency humanitarian waiver specifying life-saving medicine and medical services, it was still unclear what programs it actually applied to and whether it included services provided by PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, and other health programs, since under the State Department\u2019s [framework for foreign aid](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40213), health programs and humanitarian assistance efforts are categorized separately. As a result, the PEPFAR program applied for a specific waiver, which was [granted on February 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQgNTpC6F5oaOnkebQokJ_2eYgM_IcQNT7alIL6R3P16Ef4Z0pmQby3Y1eHbJcTxK_yJ8EPVNiibxON/pub), for certain activities.

The pledge was delivered via a pre-recorded video message by Jeremy P. Lewin, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Assistance, Humanitarian Affairs and Religious Freedom, who stated it reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to the Global Fund\u2019s life-saving work, though it represented a modest decline due to reforms and efficiencies. The Global Fund, established in 2002, has saved an estimated 70 million lives by combating HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The announcement occurred amid ongoing tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, following former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that white Afrikaners were being killed and their lands seized, prompting the U.S. to withdraw official participation from the G20 summit at NASREC Expo Centre from November 22\u201323, 2025. Social media reactions were mixed: Joseph Simpiwe praised the pledge, urging global unity and criticizing Trump\u2019s rhetoric as immature, while Masonwabe Nqawe commended the U.S. contribution and called for greater financial support from Middle Eastern nations, noting the positive impact of smaller African countries like Namibia and Zimbabwe also pledging funds.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[Briefly](https://briefly.co.za/south-africa/229431-usa-pledges-r80bn-global-fund-sidelines-g20-johannesburg-sparks-mixed-reactions-online/)\n\n**Canada Reduces Contribution to Global Fund Amid Global Health Funding Concerns**\nThe Canadian government announced a contribution of nearly one billion dollars over three years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a reduction of 190 million dollars compared to its 2022 pledge. Cindy Termorshuizen, the personal representative of Prime Minister Mark Carney at the G20 summit in Johannesburg, made the announcement ahead of Carney\u2019s arrival. Canada has supported the Global Fund since its creation in 2002, funding initiatives such as mosquito net distribution and treatment programs. However, organizations like ONE and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) criticized the reduction, calling it a setback at a critical time when a generation without AIDS is within reach. MSF warned that falling short of the 25-billion-dollar fundraising goal could lead to catastrophic cuts in essential services, resurgence of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, and increased financial burdens on vulnerable populations. The reduction aligns with broader fiscal adjustments in Canada\u2019s 2025 budget, which includes cuts to global health programs and international financial institutions, reverting foreign aid to pre-pandemic levels. Other major donors, including Germany, the UK, and the US (which has not yet announced a contribution), have also reduced their pledges. The Global Fund\u2019s eighth replenishment summit is taking place alongside the G20 summit in Johannesburg, which U.S. President Donald Trump is boycotting.

The event occurred on the sidelines of the G20 summit, amid a challenging global health funding climate marked by donor retrenchment following U.S. aid policy changes under President Donald Trump. Global Fund Executive Director Peter Sands stated that 'the old model' of development funding is over and emphasized the need for countries to become more self-reliant, while cautioning against abrupt transitions that could derail progress. The Fund plans to cut operating costs by 20% in 2026. The United States pledged $4.6 billion, though the full $6 billion pledged by former President Joe Biden in 2022 has not yet been delivered under the current administration. The Global Fund has already warned of potential cuts to existing grants through the end of 2026 due to the shortfall. Since its founding in 2002, the Global Fund has saved 70 million lives through initiatives including distributing insecticide-treated malaria nets, antiretroviral therapy for HIV, and TB treatments. In 2022, the Fund raised $15.7 billion, falling short of its $18 billion goal, and raised just over $14 billion at the pledging event that year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[bdnews24.com](https://bdnews24.com/health/d2e53af39961)\n\n**Global Leaders Commit $11 Billion to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis, Falling Short of Goal**\nAt a meeting in Johannesburg on November 21, 2025, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria received pledges totaling $11.34 billion for the 2027\u20132029 period, falling short of its $18 billion target. The Global Fund, headquartered in Geneva, operates in a challenging global health financing environment following the withdrawal of major donors after a reorganization of U.S. development aid under President Donald Trump. Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund, stated that 'the old model of development financing is over' and emphasized the need for countries to become more self-reliant, while warning that abrupt transitions could jeopardize progress.

The United States pledged $4.6 billion, down from President Joe Biden\u2019s $6 billion commitment in 2022, with the new administration not yet fully disbursing the amount. The Global Fund has already warned recipient countries of potential cuts to existing grants by the end of 2026 due to insufficient funding. Since its founding in 2002, the Global Fund has helped save approximately 70 million lives by distributing life-saving tools such as insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria, antiretroviral therapies for HIV, and tuberculosis treatments.

This contribution, announced remotely by Jeremy P. Lewin, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Assistance, Humanitarian Affairs, and Religious Freedom, represents a biennial commitment and reflects a modest decline due to internal reforms and efficiency measures. Despite ongoing tensions between the US and South Africa\u2014marked by former President Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to attend the summit and the absence of top officials like Vice President JD Vance or Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2014the US sent an observing delegation and formally received the G20 chairmanship from South Africa ahead of the 2026 summit. Lewin emphasized that the pledge aligns with the Trump administration\u2019s 'America First Global Health Strategy,' which prioritizes cutting wasteful aid programs while supporting high-impact initiatives like the Global Fund\u2019s scaled procurement of medical supplies and front-line worker support. The Global Fund, established in 2002, has saved an estimated 70 million lives from HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The replenishment event aimed to secure $14 billion in pledges against an $18 billion budget. Other major contributors included the UK ($1.02 billion), Canada ($1.02 billion), Italy (\u20ac150 million), New Zealand (NZ$3 million), Singapore ($1 million), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($2.5 million), Namibia ($1 million), Nigeria ($15 million), Zimbabwe ($1 million), and the Rockefeller Foundation ($10 million, pending approval). The EU is expected to announce a new pledge, with its historical commitment at \u20ac3.5 billion. South Africa\u2019s Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi called the event a defining moment for global health and multilateralism, affirming Africa\u2019s central role in global health leadership. Minister of State Baroness Jennifer Chapman reaffirmed the UK\u2019s commitment, while Cecelia Lodonu-Senoo of Hope For Future Generations warned that shortfalls would be 'catastrophic.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 04:46 PM\nSource:[Times LIVE](https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/2025-11-21-breaking-us-stuns-with-46bn-global-fund-pledge-amid-rift-with-sa-over-g20/)\n\n**G20 Summit: In Johannesburg, PM Modi proposes three initiatives, including one to counter drug-terror nexus**\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Johannesburg, South Africa, on November 22, 2025, for the G20 Summit, where he was welcomed by President Cyril Ramaphosa. During the first session of the summit, Modi emphasized that India's civilizational values offer a pathway to equitable global progress, calling for a reevaluation of development parameters to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth\u2014particularly as Africa hosts the summit for the first time. He proposed three key initiatives: the creation of a G20 Global Traditional Knowledge Repository to preserve India\u2019s heritage in traditional medicine and wellness; the G20-Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative, aimed at training one million certified trainers across Africa within the next decade; and a G20 Global Healthcare Response Team to rapidly deploy medical experts during health emergencies and natural disasters. Modi also introduced a G20 Initiative on Countering the Drug-Terror Nexus, urging action against the 'wretched economy' linking narcotics, especially fentanyl, to terrorism. South Africa, which assumed G20 presidency in December 2024, prioritized disaster resilience, debt sustainability for low-income countries, finance for a just energy transition, and critical minerals for inclusive growth. Notably, US President Donald Trump boycotted the summit, citing allegations that South Africa 'mistreats white people.'

The Global Fund, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, faces significant financing challenges due to reduced contributions from major donors, particularly the United States, following funding cuts announced after Donald Trump's return to the White House in January 2025. Executive Director Peter Sands stated that 'money will be scarce,' urging greater efficiency and a shift from the 'old model' of development financing, while cautioning against abrupt transitions that could hinder progress. The Fund plans to reduce operational costs by 20% in 2026. Germany was highlighted for its 'strong' support, having pledged \u20ac1 billion (approximately $1.15 billion) on October 12, 2025, during the Global Health Summit in Berlin. German Minister for Development Riem Al-Balawi Radovan emphasized that the commitment sends a clear message of Germany\u2019s continued dedication to protecting people from diseases worldwide. Sands also warned of growing global health disparities, particularly due to frozen international aid since Trump\u2019s second presidency, and reiterated the Fund\u2019s commitment to redirecting more resources to the poorest countries to help them manage aid reductions. The Global Fund remains one of the most effective ways to save lives and strengthen global health security.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 10:12 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86-11-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B2-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**USA pledges R80bn to Global Fund on sidelines of G20 in Johannesburg, sparks mixed reactions online**\nOn November 21, 2025, the United States announced a $4.6 billion (R80.25 billion) pledge to the Global Fund during the replenishment drive in Johannesburg, despite not participating in the G20 World Leaders' Summit.

The event occurred on the sidelines of the G20 summit, amid a challenging global health funding climate marked by donor retrenchment following U.S. aid policy changes under President Donald Trump. Global Fund Executive Director Peter Sands stated that 'the old model' of development funding is over and emphasized the need for countries to become more self-reliant, while cautioning against abrupt transitions that could derail progress. The Fund plans to cut operating costs by 20% in 2026. The United States pledged $4.6 billion, though the full $6 billion pledged by former President Joe Biden in 2022 has not yet been delivered under the current administration. The Global Fund has already warned of potential cuts to existing grants through the end of 2026 due to the shortfall. Since its founding in 2002, the Global Fund has saved 70 million lives through initiatives including distributing insecticide-treated malaria nets, antiretroviral therapy for HIV, and TB treatments. In 2022, the Fund raised $15.7 billion, falling short of its $18 billion goal, and raised just over $14 billion at the pledging event that year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[bdnews24.com](https://bdnews24.com/health/d2e53af39961)\n\n**Global Leaders Commit $11 Billion to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis, Falling Short of Goal**\nAt a meeting in Johannesburg on November 21, 2025, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria received pledges totaling $11.34 billion for the 2027\u20132029 period, falling short of its $18 billion target. The Global Fund, headquartered in Geneva, operates in a challenging global health financing environment following the withdrawal of major donors after a reorganization of U.S. development aid under President Donald Trump. Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund, stated that 'the old model of development financing is over' and emphasized the need for countries to become more self-reliant, while warning that abrupt transitions could jeopardize progress. The Fund plans to reduce operational costs by 20% in 2026. The United States pledged $4.6 billion, down from President Joe Biden\u2019s $6 billion commitment in 2022, with the new administration not yet fully disbursing the amount. The Global Fund has already warned recipient countries of potential cuts to existing grants by the end of 2026 due to insufficient funding. Since its founding in 2002, the Global Fund has helped save approximately 70 million lives by distributing life-saving tools such as insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria, antiretroviral therapies for HIV, and tuberculosis treatments.

This contribution, announced remotely by Jeremy P. Lewin, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Assistance, Humanitarian Affairs, and Religious Freedom, represents a biennial commitment and reflects a modest decline due to internal reforms and efficiency measures. Despite ongoing tensions between the US and South Africa\u2014marked by former President Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to attend the summit and the absence of top officials like Vice President JD Vance or Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2014the US sent an observing delegation and formally received the G20 chairmanship from South Africa ahead of the 2026 summit. Lewin emphasized that the pledge aligns with the Trump administration\u2019s 'America First Global Health Strategy,' which prioritizes cutting wasteful aid programs while supporting high-impact initiatives like the Global Fund\u2019s scaled procurement of medical supplies and front-line worker support. The Global Fund, established in 2002, has saved an estimated 70 million lives from HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The replenishment event aimed to secure $14 billion in pledges against an $18 billion budget. Other major contributors included the UK ($1.02 billion), Canada ($1.02 billion), Italy (\u20ac150 million), New Zealand (NZ$3 million), Singapore ($1 million), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($2.5 million), Namibia ($1 million), Nigeria ($15 million), Zimbabwe ($1 million), and the Rockefeller Foundation ($10 million, pending approval). The EU is expected to announce a new pledge, with its historical commitment at \u20ac3.5 billion. South Africa\u2019s Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi called the event a defining moment for global health and multilateralism, affirming Africa\u2019s central role in global health leadership. Minister of State Baroness Jennifer Chapman reaffirmed the UK\u2019s commitment, while Cecelia Lodonu-Senoo of Hope For Future Generations warned that shortfalls would be 'catastrophic.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 04:46 PM\nSource:[Times LIVE](https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/2025-11-21-breaking-us-stuns-with-46bn-global-fund-pledge-amid-rift-with-sa-over-g20/)\n\n**Canada cuts back spending on fighting infectious diseases at G20 in South Africa**\nPrime Minister Mark Carney announced Canada's reduced contribution of $1.02 billion to the Global Fund for 2026\u20132028, a decrease of $190 million (over 17%) from its 2022\u20132025 pledge of $1.21 billion. This marks Canada's first-ever cut to the program, which supports global efforts to combat AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria through initiatives like mosquito net distribution and HIV/TB treatment. The reduction, made just before Carney\u2019s arrival at the G20 summit in Johannesburg, has drawn sharp criticism from Canada\u2019s development sector. Justin McAuley of the One Campaign called the move a 'quitting a marathon in the last kilometre,' noting that the Global Fund has saved 70 million lives and remains the most effective global health investment. Adam Houston of Doctors Without Borders expressed 'deep disappointment,' warning that the cut undermines progress and risks reversing gains in the fight against infectious diseases. The Global Fund is currently at $11.4 billion of its $18 billion target, with Germany and the U.K. also reducing contributions by 17% and 15%, respectively. The U.S. remains the largest donor, pledging $4.6 billion in 2025, down from $6 billion in 2022. The replenishment summit occurred on the eve of the G20 summit, chaired by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who emphasized global inequality. The Canadian Press first published this report on November 21, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 03:20 PM\nSource:[SooToday.com](https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/canada-cuts-back-spending-on-fighting-infectious-diseases-at-g20-in-south-africa-11522055)\n\n**This May Be the Cruelest, Most Senseless Thing Trump Has Done**\nAtul Gawande, former overseer of USAID's global health programs during the Biden administration, criticized the Trump administration's dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), citing a sharp decline in global health and humanitarian aid following an executive order signed in January 2025. Within hours of the inauguration, foreign aid was halted, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio enforcing a freeze on U.S. dollars for global health, halting HIV, TB, and malaria treatments, as well as food aid. Gawande reported that the dismantling included the termination of over 80% of ongoing awards and projects, the purging of staff, and the cancellation of programs, all in violation of legal mandates. He emphasized that the human toll is severe and underreported, with infectious disease modeler Brooke Nichols estimating 600,000 deaths\u2014400,000 of them children\u2014attributed to the aid cuts so far. Gawande described the administration\u2019s efforts to make these deaths 'invisible' and stressed the importance of making the 'invisible visible.' The documentary *Rovina's Choice*, produced by Gawande and *The New Yorker*, illustrates the physical and emotional suffering of a Sudanese refugee in Kenya and her daughter Jane, who suffers from severe malnutrition, including unhealing skin fissures and extreme vulnerability to infection. Gawande noted that modern tools like 'Plumpy'Nut and community outreach could prevent such suffering, with UNICEF estimating over 1 million lives saved in 2023 alone through such interventions. The cuts, he argued, are not only morally indefensible but also counterproductive to U.S. national security and global stability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 16, 2025 12:01 PM\nSource:[The Bulwark](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-may-be-the-cruelest-most-senseless)\n\n**The Shutdown of U.S.A.I.D. Has Already Killed Hundreds of Thousands**\nThe article, published on November 5, 2025, by *The New Yorker*, recounts the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.) following the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2024. The author, a former U.S.A.I.D. official who left a medical and public-health career in Boston to lead global-health efforts, reflects on the agency\u2019s achievements: containing 21 deadly disease outbreaks, supporting Ukraine\u2019s health system post-invasion, combating HIV, tuberculosis, and polio, and reducing maternal and child mortality. Over two decades, U.S.A.I.D. saved an estimated 92 million lives, according to a peer-reviewed analysis in *The Lancet*, with a budget of just $24 per American annually. Despite bipartisan support and Trump\u2019s prior commitments\u2014such as pledging to end HIV as a public-health threat by 2030\u2014within hours of taking office, Trump signed an executive order pausing all foreign aid. Secretary of State Marco Rubio then suspended all programs without warning to partner nations, halting payments, delivery of medicines and food, and freezing funds. Elon Musk publicly celebrated the dismantling, and within weeks, over 80% of U.S.A.I.D. contracts were terminated, staff purged, and assets impounded, defying legal mandates. The article cites epidemiologist Brooke Nichols of Boston University, whose conservative model estimates that U.S.A.I.D.'s collapse has already caused 600,000 deaths\u2014two-thirds of them children\u2014by November 5, 2025. The author describes these deaths as 'public man-made death,' noting their slow, scattered nature makes them less visible than war casualties. The piece emphasizes that the human toll will continue to grow, with no intervention from Congress or the Supreme Court.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 09:23 PM\nSource:[The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands)\n\n**The Trump administration's approach to global health is flawed but fixable**\nThe Trump administration's approach to global health, as critiqued in an article published by The Economist on October 30, 2025, is described as flawed but fixable. The piece contrasts the legacy of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), launched in 2003 under George W. Bush, which has saved over 25 million lives\u2014mostly in sub-Saharan Africa\u2014with the current administration\u2019s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and proposed cuts to bilateral health aid by two-thirds. These actions have caused disruptions: antiretroviral (ARV) supplies have run out in southern Africa, malaria treatment deliveries have been interrupted, cholera deaths have risen, vaccination drives have stalled, and food rations in refugee camps have declined. The article cites forecasts of hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of additional deaths. While the administration\u2019s 'America First Global Health Strategy' aims to protect Americans by focusing on 'front-line' work and bypassing what it calls 'wasteful' multilateral programs in favor of direct deals with governments pursuing 'full self-reliance,' the strategy risks undermining its own goals. The article argues that defunding surveillance systems could allow infections to spread across borders, endangering Americans. Moreover, the poorest African nations lack the capacity to strengthen health systems without aid, even as new technologies\u2014such as malaria vaccines requiring only two doses per year\u2014could reduce bureaucratic burdens. The article notes that over three-quarters of Republicans support aid for saving lives, despite skepticism toward broader development spending. It concludes that 'America First' should not mean 'Africa last,' emphasizing that saving lives in Africa remains both a moral and strategic imperative.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 01:49 PM\nSource:[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/10/30/the-trump-administrations-approach-to-global-health-is-flawed-but-fixable)\n\n**The Trump Administration's Foreign Aid Review: Status of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) | KFF**\nThe Trump administration's foreign aid review, initiated on the first day of its second term, has significantly disrupted U.S. global health programs, particularly the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). Executive actions included a 90-day foreign aid review, a stop-work order freezing all payments and services, the dissolution of USAID (including the reduction of most staff and contractors), and the cancellation of most foreign assistance awards. A limited waiver issued on February 4, 2025, allowed only 'life-saving services'\u2014such as malaria diagnosis, treatment, bed net distribution, and antimalarial medicines for pregnant women and children\u2014to continue, but implementation remained hampered by delayed payments and bureaucratic hurdles. The dissolution of USAID, the primary implementing agency for PMI (which obligated 96% of bilateral malaria assistance in FY 2023), severely weakened PMI's operational capacity. KFF analysis found that 86% of USAID awards were canceled, including 157 global health awards with malaria activities\u201480% of which were terminated. Legal challenges have yielded limited success: a preliminary injunction was issued and later overturned by the D.C. Circuit Court, and the Supreme Court ultimately ruled the government could withhold funds. The administration announced on March 28, 2025, its intent to permanently dissolve USAID and transfer global health functions to the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy (GHSD), with reorganization completed by July 2025. The September 2025 America First Global Health Strategy outlines a shift toward bilateral, country-specific aid and reduced multilateral engagement. Internal USAID estimates project that a permanent halt to PMI could result in 12.5\u201317.9 million additional malaria cases and 71,000\u2013166,000 additional deaths annually. A rapid assessment of 64 malaria-endemic countries found over half reported moderate to severe disruptions in malaria services, including shortages of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). As of early April 2025, nearly 30% of planned ITN distribution campaigns were off-track or delayed. These disruptions pose severe risks during peak malaria seasons in Africa, with one major implementer reporting delays in anti-malarial campaigns. Despite these setbacks, the FY 2025 Continuing Resolution provided level funding of $805 million for PMI and related malaria activities, and the FY 2026 budget request proposes $424 million\u2014a reduction of $381 million from current levels. The U.S. remains the top donor to malaria efforts through PMI and contributions to the Global Fund.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[KFF](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-the-presidents-malaria-initiative-pmi/)\n\n**This tiny nation was winning in its fight against HIV. Then Trump cut foreign aid**\nOn January 20, 2024, the first day of Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid, leading to the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This action severely disrupted HIV programs in Lesotho, a small southern African nation with one of the world\u2019s highest HIV infection rates. Prior to the cuts, nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid\u2014primarily through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\u2014had helped Lesotho achieve significant progress, including reaching UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal by late 2023. However, after the aid freeze, Lesotho lost at least 23% of its PEPFAR funding, resulting in the closure of clinics, layoffs of 1,500 health workers, and the suspension of HIV prevention programs targeting mother-to-child transmission, male circumcision, and high-risk groups. Patients began rationing medication, and health workers like Lisebo Lechela and Mapapali Mosoeunyane reported a collapse in services, with many fearing death due to interrupted treatment. Although the U.S. State Department announced in September 2024 a six-month bridge program to reinstate some lifesaving initiatives\u2014including testing, treatment, and a new long-acting HIV prevention shot\u2014implementation remains slow and uncertain. Lesotho, which funded only 12% of its health budget domestically, now faces a crisis in sustaining its HIV response. Health officials and experts warn that the cuts have set back progress by at least 15 years and risk reversing decades of gains, with UNAIDS warning up to 4 million global deaths could occur without restored funding. Despite some temporary relief, many in Lesotho feel betrayed and hopeless, with health workers and patients alike expressing despair over the loss of life-saving support. As of October 2025, no formal agreement has been secured, and hundreds of health workers remain unemployed despite verbal promises of absorption into the national system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 08:17 AM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/lesotho-hiv-aids-trump-africa-b2846428.html)\n\n**The U.S. Government and Global Health | KFF**\nThe U.S. government has historically played a leading role in global health through bilateral and multilateral programs, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has saved 26 million lives since its 2003 launch and remains the largest national commitment to a single disease. PEPFAR, housed in the Department of State, is now facing significant scope reduction and accelerated transition plans under the current Trump administration. The U.S. has also been a major contributor to global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts, malaria prevention via the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), maternal and child health (MCH), nutrition, family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and global health security. Since 2005, PMI has expanded coverage of six key interventions\u2014diagnosis, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs), intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)\u2014to combat malaria. U.S. MCH programs, previously managed by USAID, focused on reducing maternal, newborn, and under-five mortality and strengthening health systems. Nutrition efforts were coordinated through the Feed the Future Initiative (FtF), and FP/RH programs supported contraception, counseling, and post-abortion care, including funding to UNFPA. NTD programs targeted five major diseases through mass drug administration (MDA). Global health security initiatives, including the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and the Pandemic Fund, have been undermined by the current administration\u2019s withdrawal from international engagement, elimination of key positions, and termination of the 2014 global health security strategy. All remaining global health programs have been transferred to the State Department, with reduced scope and funding due to the dissolution of USAID and a broader foreign aid reorganization.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[KFF](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/health-policy-101-the-u-s-government-and-global-health/)\n\n**Opinion: Weakening the World's Ability to Fight Malaria**\nMona Gable, a writer and former journalist, recounts her near-fatal experience with malaria after traveling to Zambia in July 2023. She was diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum, a severe form of malaria, after being bitten by an infected Anopheles mosquito. Her condition was critical, with approximately 20% of her red blood cells infected, and she required emergency treatment. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) played a crucial role in her survival by identifying the disease and facilitating the delivery of the life-saving drug artesunate, which was produced at a CDC facility and took two days to arrive. Gable attributes her survival to the CDC\u2019s expertise and infrastructure. However, she warns that the U.S. government\u2019s dismantling of USAID and the CDC\u2019s Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria\u2014under the Trump administration and subsequent leadership\u2014has severely weakened global and domestic malaria control efforts. The President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI), which protected 12.5 million people in 2023, is now nearly defunct due to funding cuts. The CDC\u2019s malaria division was dismantled, staff were transferred or dismissed, and key scientists were recalled from international posts. This erosion of capacity has compromised the U.S.\u2019s ability to respond to emerging cases, including 10 homegrown cases in Texas, Florida, Arkansas, and Maryland in 2023. The situation is exacerbated by climate change, which is expanding the range of malaria-carrying mosquitoes into new regions, including Washington, D.C., and New Jersey. The Anopheles stephensi mosquito, resistant to insecticides and thriving in urban areas, is spreading across sub-Saharan Africa. Gable criticizes the removal of CDC director Susan Monarez and the resignation of senior officials in protest of politicized health decisions. She emphasizes that the U.S. is no longer immune to malaria, despite its elimination in 1951, and calls for urgent action to protect public health science and institutions. She concludes by stating that without the CDC, she would have died.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 01:30 AM\nSource:[The Good Men Project](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/opinion-weakening-the-worlds-ability-to-fight-malaria/)\n\n**Death of Babies in Cameroon Reveals How U.S. Aid Cuts Are Undermining the Fight Against Malaria**\nThe death of nine-month-old Mohamat in northern Cameroon from malaria highlights how U.S. foreign aid cuts have undermined malaria control efforts. Mohamat died after three days of fever, too late for treatment, as the local health center lacked injectable artesunate\u2014a life-saving drug previously funded by the U.S. President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid, including the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), upon taking office in January 2025. Although a limited exemption allowed continued malaria work, the abrupt withdrawal caused major disruptions: 2,105 of 2,354 U.S.-funded community health workers in northern and extreme northern Cameroon lost their jobs. PMI had supported half of the region\u2019s 2,824 community health workers, providing stipends, transport, bicycles, and uniforms. The loss of these workers has led to delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment. Dr. Jean-Pierre Kidwang, regional malaria coordinator, noted that malaria mortality in the region dropped from 17% to 8% under PMI support, but recent trends suggest a sharp rise, with preliminary data indicating a 15% mortality rate in the first half of 2025. The U.S. administration claims it is reforming aid under a 'America First' agenda and denies any deaths resulted from cuts. However, the World Health Organization and on-the-ground organizations report critical gaps in malaria response. The proposed 2026 budget cuts PMI funding by 47%, from nearly $800 million to $420 million, though Congress will decide. The State Department stated that U.S. support for malaria prevention\u2014such as bed nets, medicines, and frontline health workers\u2014would remain at 100% of current levels in fiscal year 2026, with a call for co-investment by partner nations. Anne Linn, former PMI health community advisor, stated that 115,000 community health workers across 30 countries were supported by PMI before the cuts, and it remains unclear how much funding has been restored. No details were provided on the current annual U.S. funding level.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 03:33 PM\nSource:[Forbes M\u00e9xico](https://forbes.com.mx/muerte-de-bebes-en-camerun-muestra-como-los-recortes-de-la-ayuda-de-eu-limitan-la-lucha-contra-la-malaria/)\n\n**Babies' deaths in Cameroon show how US aid cuts curtail malaria fight**\nThe article documents how U.S. foreign aid cuts, particularly the suspension of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) under the Trump administration, have disrupted malaria prevention and treatment efforts in Cameroon\u2019s Far North region. Before the cuts, PMI supported 1,492 of 2,824 community health workers in the region, providing stipends, transport, bicycles, and clothing. Now, 2,105 out of 2,354 U.S.-funded health workers are no longer active. This has led to delayed diagnoses and inadequate treatment, contributing to a rise in malaria deaths. Malaria fatalities in the Far North region dropped from 1,519 in 2020 to 653 in 2024 under PMI, but are now rising again, with preliminary data suggesting a mortality rate of 15% in the first half of 2025\u2014up from 8% during PMI\u2019s peak support. Injectable artesunate, a life-saving drug funded by the U.S., is in short supply, with only 200,000 vials arriving in Maroua in September\u2014insufficient for three months. The cuts have also disrupted data collection, as PMI\u2019s website is offline for review, limiting transparency. Families like those of Mohamat, Djidja, and Daouda Amadou have lost children to malaria due to delayed care. The Trump administration claims the cuts are part of an 'America First' agenda and asserts no deaths have occurred due to the cuts, though WHO and on-the-ground organizations report 'critical gaps.' The proposed 2026 budget includes a 47% cut to PMI, though the State Department says it will maintain 100% funding for commodities and frontline workers through bilateral agreements, with calls for partner countries to co-invest. Similar disruptions are reported in Liberia and other African nations. According to Anne Linn, former PMI advisor, 115,000 community health workers across 30 countries were supported before the cuts, with unclear recovery of funding.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:15 AM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/world/babies-deaths-in-cameroon-show-how-us-aid-cuts-curtail-malaria-fight/2755713/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) has faced historically unprecedented disruption and operational collapse due to recent executive actions\u2014including the dissolution of USAID, major staff layoffs, halted awards, and PMI's website being offline\u2014as well as severe funding cuts proposed for FY2026. Despite these shocks, there is consensus that the legal and bureaucratic hurdles to full program elimination are considerable. The criteria for PMI 'ceasing to exist' are strict: full legal termination, a completed merger or absorption into another agency resulting in the loss of the program's distinct identity, or total elimination of Congressional funding, any of which must occur before January 1, 2026, and persist (if by executive order) for at least 60 consecutive days.\n\nMost experts emphasize the following decreasing-probability factors: PMI was created by statute and has been protected by Congressional appropriations and institutional inertia; Congress continued FY2025 funding and has not yet enacted a law eliminating PMI; and, historically, major US global health programs with bipartisan support are rarely terminated outright in such a short period. Other decreasing factors include ongoing (though reduced) US support for malaria (such as Global Fund pledges), advocacy coalition mobilization, potential legal obstacles to sustained executive action, and the inertia of bureaucratic reorganization.\n\nIncreasing-probability factors include the rapid, drastic actions taken by the Trump administration to dissolve USAID and transfer PMI functions to the State Department, the possibility of administrative absorption or merger of PMI into another entity, the near-total gutting of operational capacity, and a strong executive push against global health funding.\n\nAll experts delineate scenarios in which PMI either barely survives, possibly as a nominal program or skeletal structure (the 'No' outcome), or is formally dissolved, merged, or loses all funding and legal distinctiveness (the 'Yes' outcome). The central risk is that the merger or absorption into the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy might satisfy the criteria for PMI's cessation if completed and documented as a total loss of identity.\n\nFinal probability estimates for PMI ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, cluster between 10% and 35%, with most experts landing closer to the 15\u201320% range. The main reasons for skepticism about total cessation in the short time left are the proven resilience of US statutory programs, ongoing Congressional funding, and a lack of public evidence for a clear-cut, completed legal elimination or irreversible merger as of late November 2025. The overall consensus is that operational devastation does not, by itself, meet the required threshold\u2014making outright legal, programmatic death by January 1, 2026, unlikely, though not impossible.",
