No reporting contradicts that this formal approval was granted or will be reversed. While VRBPAC/ACIP meetings have been disrupted, these are more advisory than strictly regulatory, and there is no evidence that the change would retroactively block vaccine approvals for a season that is already imminent. Disengagement from WHO and politics may disrupt future years, but for 2025\u201326, inertia and manufacturer pressure are likely to sustain the status quo. Thus, barring an unprecedented and public FDA reversal, approval for at least one new seasonal flu vaccine by October 1 is extremely likely\u2014but hedging slightly below 100% due to the possibility of last-minute bureaucratic sabotage.",

While you recognize the highly unusual withdrawal from the WHO and leadership turnover, the argument could benefit from deeper exploration of how the legal and bureaucratic foundations for approval could, in a worst-case scenario, become subject to challenge or contestation even if the technical steps for approval were seemingly followed in March. For instance, turbulence in federal authority could create last-minute legal ambiguities around the standing of previous decisions, which might not be visible through traditional supply, manufacturing, or public health messaging channels.

Given the timing\u2014manufacturers already shipping according to validated lines, product labeled, release testing completed\u2014by mid-September the risk of even a politically motivated regulatory reversal is virtually nil. The technical and procedural interlocks ensuring vaccine supply at this stage (including stability program requirements, distribution chain QA holds, and contingency plans for lot withdrawal) make it highly implausible that any reversal would not have immediately surfaced industry-wide news. While your recognition of residual 'political escalation' risk is prudent, the timeline and crisis triggers you postulate are less credible for this cycle given this late phase of GMP-controlled distribution.

This viewpoint resonates with antigenic drift surveillance: real-time strain drift triggers annual reformulation, but absent a biological shock or regulatory collapse not evident in credible reporting, the primary risk is not viral mismatch but bureaucratic sabotage. Your argument complements mine by grounding the risk calculus not just in government process but in the irreversibility of advanced manufacturing for a staple public health intervention.

Forecasters with manufacturing, regulatory pathways, and GMP backgrounds persuasively argue that by mid-September, all major regulatory and operational controls (including QA, release testing, supply contracts, and product distribution) are complete, and a late-stage regulatory reversal would almost certainly be visible in credible, public reporting. No new information or scenario surfaced in discussion that credibly signals reversal, rescission, or invalidation of approval. Epistemic humility is still warranted due to the unique political context, but the possible failure modes (such as last-minute administrative paralysis or ambiguous authority) are further discounted by the lack of even minor signals for such breakdowns. Thus, I am modestly increasing my probability to reflect this additional discounting of late-stage risk.",

The GMP and manufacturing frameworks underscore that, at this advanced point in the supply chain, risk of practical or regulatory reversal without immediate and conspicuous reporting is essentially negligible. While my initial forecast took into account base rates, explicit approval, and political/administrative risks, the group highlighted how deeply procedural inertia and real-world logistics lock in the outcome by mid-September. Although the concern for extreme black swans raised by some remains theoretically conceivable, there is no new evidence suggesting an increase in risk; more accurately, the collective view suggests even greater odds in favor of YES.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn February 26, 2025, the FDA unexpectedly canceled its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting that was scheduled for March 2025. This meeting is typically held annually to select the influenza virus strains to be included in the upcoming season's flu vaccines for the United States.\n\nThe FDA has maintained an uninterrupted annual approval process for seasonal influenza vaccines since 1973. Each year, the FDA follows a consistent timeline for approving updated flu vaccine formulations based on recommendations about which influenza strains are likely to circulate during the upcoming flu season. The strain selection process typically occurs in spring to give vaccine manufacturers sufficient time to produce shots for fall distribution.\n\nThe cancellation coincides with other significant changes in U.S. public health policy:\n\n* In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization (WHO)\n* Federal health officials were subsequently ordered to stop communicating with the WHO\n* A CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was also recently postponed\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":35582,\"question_id\":35030}}`",

The change will reduce mandatory vaccines to varicella, hepatitis\u202fB, influenza\u202fHib, and pneumococcal diseases, while keeping polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus. The decision places responsibility on parents, as stated by state health secretary Joseph\u202fLadapo: 'Si quieren, Dios los bendiga, pueden poner todas las que deseen. Y si no, los padres deben tener la capacidad y el poder de decidir qu\u00e9 entra en el cuerpo de sus hijos. Es as\u00ed de simple'. The move follows a rise in vaccine\u2011preventable diseases: measles has reached its worst U.S. outbreak in over 30\u202fyears with more than 1,400 confirmed cases and three deaths, mainly in Texas; pertussis has caused the deaths of at least two babies in Louisiana and a five\u2011year\u2011old in Washington, with more than 19,000 reported cases as of August\u202f23, up nearly 2,000 from the same date last year, according to CDC preliminary data. The World Health Organization reports that vaccines have saved at least 154\u202fmillion lives worldwide in the past 50\u202fyears. Florida currently allows religious exemptions. The state legislature will not reconvene until January\u202f2026, with committees meeting in October, meaning the current vaccination schedule will remain in force for the rest of the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 10:19 PM\nSource:[CiberCuba](https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-09-15-u1-e135253-s27061-nid310966-cambio-norma-vacunas-escolares-florida-entrara-vigor)\n\n**Despite Policy Confusion, Vaccines for Flu, COVID Still Strongly Recommended**\nMichigan Medicine experts explain that flu, RSV, and COVID vaccines remain essential for preventing severe disease and death. Pamela Rockwell, D.O., notes that immunization rates are falling, citing a recent measles outbreak and that 14 Michigan children died of the flu last year, most unvaccinated. Adam Lauring, M.D., Ph.D., confirms that the science of vaccine benefit hasn't changed. He states the 2025\u20112026 flu vaccine is updated and should be available soon; for most people it can be taken anytime, but if not high\u2011risk, October is acceptable. Lauring also describes FluMist, an inhaled live\u2011attenuated vaccine approved for home use in ages 2\u201149, noting it can cause mild sniffles but does not give flu. RSV vaccine recommendations target people over 75, those 50\u201174 with chronic conditions, and pregnant women between 32\u201136 weeks; a monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab, protects infants \u22648\u202fmonths. CDC data for the 2024\u20112025 RSV season show 190,000\u2011350,000 hospitalizations and 10,000\u201123,000 deaths. Regarding COVID, Rockwell says the recommendation that people 6\u202fmonths and older are eligible remains, but policy changes may limit access: the FDA ended emergency use for Pfizer in kids under 5, leaving Moderna as the only option; the FDA now recommends COVID vaccines only for those 65+ or at high risk, listing conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, cancer, obesity, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes, depression, disabilities, physical inactivity, pregnancy, etc. She warns that insurance coverage could be jeopardized and that many patients declined the vaccine when offered.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[The Good Men Project](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/despite-policy-confusion-vaccines-for-flu-covid-still-strongly-recommended/)\n\n**How RFK Jr. just made getting vaccinated a matter of what state you live in**\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, has reversed many vaccine policies, sparking a split across states. In June, he dismissed all 17 members of the CDC\u2019s independent advisory panel on immunization and replaced them with vaccine skeptics, claiming the move was to 're\u2011establish public confidence in vaccine science.' He also cancelled $500\u202fmillion in federal funding for mRNA vaccine research and removed former CDC director Susan Monarez in late August. The FDA narrowed approval of updated COVID\u201119 shots for people under 65 to those with at least one underlying condition, excluding otherwise eligible individuals.\n\nStates have responded in divergent ways. The West Coast Health Alliance\u2014Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii\u2014announced it would issue its own vaccine guidance to counter the CDC\u2019s \"destruction.\" Florida, led by Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Governor Ron\u202fDeSantis, became the first state to abolish school vaccine mandates, with Ladapo declaring that 'every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery.' In contrast, New\u202fMexico, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Colorado allowed pharmacies to administer COVID\u201119 vaccines without prescriptions. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey ordered insurers to cover all state\u2011recommended immunizations; New\u202fYork Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order protecting near\u2011universal access to COVID\u201119 vaccines until October\u202f5; Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and New Jersey Dept. of Health expanded pharmacy access; Virginia Health Commissioner Karen Shelton cleared pharmacy administration for adults 65+ and certain 18\u201164 medical conditions. Illinois remains undecided, expecting guidance by end of September. Former CDC chief of staff Kyle McGowan warned that without federal leadership, states would pursue \"50 states doing 50 different things.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 01:03 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/covid-vaccine-2025-trump-rfk-where-b2820238.html)\n\n**Butantan\u2019s Race to Produce 80\u202fMillion Flu Vaccine Doses Before Next Winter**\nThe article explains how the Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o\u202fPaulo is operating a \"war\u2011like\" effort to produce 80\u202fmillion doses of the seasonal influenza vaccine before the upcoming winter.

One doctor recounted spending 30\u202fminutes returning calls from anxious patients and said, 'Had I reviewed their histories and written vaccine prescriptions it would have taken all day. I would have had to reschedule 18 future appointments to make up that lost day.' The article blames Health and Human Secretary Robert Kennedy for an anti\u2011vaccination stance, noting that he fired the Advisory Panel on Immunization Practices, the body that approves immunization recommendations. Without that panel\u2019s approval, most states will not allow COVID shots without a written prescription. It cites a September\u202f17\u201118 panel meeting that will now be staffed by Kennedy\u2019s appointees, raising concerns about decision\u2011making.\n\nThe piece also highlights federal budget cuts: CDC funding has been cut by nearly half, leading to eroded confidence among health professionals; the National Institutes of Health has lost more than $2\u202fbillion in grants and 1,300 jobs, causing research and clinical trials to be canceled. It warns that a projected $1\u202fbillion cut to Medicaid from Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d will take effect in October\u202f2026, and that North Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services has recommended a $819\u202fmillion Medicaid increase for the current budget year, but only $500\u202fmillion was authorized. This shortfall forces a minimum 3\u202f% reduction in payments to Medicaid providers and a 10\u202f% cut for inpatient, residential, behavioral therapy and autism services.\n\nThe article predicts that over 600,000 Medicaid\u2011expanded enrollees could lose benefits, pushing more patients to emergency departments. It also raises the possibility that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) could be revised or repealed under the financial strain on hospitals, potentially leading to the closure of rural hospitals. Finally, it reports a new COVID strain, Stratus, surging in South Carolina and other southern states.\n\nThe tone is highly sensational, using loaded language and political framing to present a narrative of crisis and blame.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 04:11 PM\nSource:[newstopicnews.com](https://www.newstopicnews.com/archives/confusion-fear-over-healthcare/article_22f7bcde-afcb-5e8a-b574-a8633d030223.html)\n\n**AIFA Approves 11 Vaccines for the 2025\u20112026 Influenza Season**\nOn September 9, 2025, AIFA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) announced that 11 influenza vaccines have been authorized for the 2025\u20112026 season.

In a shift from the previous four\u2011valent formulation, the CDC will procure a trivalent vaccine for the 2024 season.  The change follows a World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that, since March\u202f2020, no natural B\u2011type Yamagata strain has been detected worldwide, and that the strain should be removed from vaccine compositions.  CDC Deputy Director Tseng Shih\u2011hui explained that the decision was made after the 24\u202fJanuary 2024 advisory meeting of the Ministry of Health and Welfare\u2019s Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Advisory Committee.  The agency will purchase 6\u202f864\u202f910 trivalent doses, of which 6\u202f479\u202f080 are earmarked for the 114\u2011year influenza vaccination program, 185\u202f830 for central and local procurement, and an additional 200\u202f000 doses may be ordered to meet demand.  The procurement cost is about 1.57\u202fbillion New Taiwan dollars.  Five manufacturers\u2014Guangong, GlaxoSmithKline, Taiwan Oriental, Sanofi, and High\u2011End Vaccine\u2014will supply the vaccine.  Children from elementary to high school, vocational, and junior college first\u2011through\u2011third\u2011year students will receive the vaccine on campus to reduce travel for parents.  The CDC is also improving the \u201cVaccination Administration Electronic System (NIAS)\u201d so parents can sign consent online via a QR code or link, or use paper forms if preferred.  Tseng noted that the switch to a trivalent vaccine aligns Taiwan with advanced countries and follows WHO guidance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 07:38 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8993600)\n\n**VACCINE CULTISTS at the CDC and FDA are being ousted right and left as Trump and RFK Jr. clean house and drain the PHARMA SWAMP   - NaturalNews.com**\nThe article reports a dramatic shift in U.S. public\u2011health policy, noting that former President Donald Trump has publicly distanced himself from the COVID\u201119 vaccines produced under his Operation Warp Speed, and that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken aggressive steps to overhaul the CDC and FDA. In a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Kennedy was questioned by Senator Ron Wyden about alleged statements to former CDC Director Susan Monarrez; Kennedy denied the claim, saying, 'No, I did not say that to her,' and later replied, 'Yes, sir,' when Wyden asked if Monarrez was lying.

Kathy Hochul signed an executive order on Friday to expand COVID\u201119 vaccine access in New York, allowing pharmacists to prescribe and administer shots, including boosters for children as young as three. The order, which will remain in effect for at least 30 days while a long\u2011term legislative solution is developed, is framed as a response to what the governor calls the \u2018Trump Administration\u2019s misguided attack on immunization and healthcare\u2019 and to the federal Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary\u2019s decision in May to stop recommending COVID vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women.

Kennedy Jr. pledged to prioritize Long\u202fCOVID, promising to fund research and diagnostics. By August\u202f2025, he had dismantled key federal programs: the Office of Long\u202fCOVID Research and Practice was closed, the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion was consolidated, and NIH\u2011funded clinical trials for antivirals and immunotherapies were halted. The cuts also stopped large\u2011scale cohort studies and diagnostics development. Kennedy\u2019s reorganization coincided with a Trump executive order to reduce federal bureaucracy, but the agency\u2019s actions alone bear responsibility. He has also restricted COVID\u2011vaccination access: the FDA denied approval for vaccines under 65 without high\u2011risk conditions, revoked EUA for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine in children under 5, and limited Moderna\u2019s formulation to high\u2011risk children. The CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was overhauled, replacing members with vaccine skeptics. Kennedy cut $500\u202fmillion from mRNA research, halted CastleVax\u2019s intranasal vaccine, and altered wastewater surveillance thresholds, reducing data reliability. These moves undermine prevention, research, and public health infrastructure, leaving millions of Long\u202fCOVID patients without support.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to recommend that all people aged six months and older receive a yearly flu vaccine, and most insurers will cover it. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert\u202fF.\u202fKennedy\u202fJr., who has previously opposed vaccines, nevertheless agreed that most people should get the flu shot. A federal panel rejected a recommendation for multidose shots containing thimerosal, but the preservative has already been removed from most flu vaccines. The vaccine for this season is a trivalent formulation that protects against two influenza\u202fA strains and one influenza\u202fB strain, with an updated A/H3N2 component that aligns with WHO guidance. Experts advise getting vaccinated in September, October, or early November so that antibody levels peak before the February influenza peak. While the vaccine does not guarantee perfect protection, it reduces the risk of severe illness and death; as William\u202fSchaffner, a Vanderbilt professor, said, 'protecting us from the most severe consequences of influenza.' Benjamin\u202fLee, a pediatric infectious diseases physician, added, 'A flu vaccine may not guarantee perfect protection against the flu, but skipping your flu shot simply guarantees you'll have no protection at all.' The FDA approved the vaccine formula on March\u202f13, and manufacturers are expected to have an adequate supply by September.

This updates the H3N2 component from the 2024\u201125 season. Routine annual vaccination is recommended for all persons \u22656\u202fmonths without contraindication. The CDC advises that most people receive one dose in September or October, but vaccination can continue after October as long as viruses circulate and vaccine is available. \"Vaccination during July and August is not recommended for most groups because of potential waning of vaccine\u2011induced immunity during the influenza season.\" July and August vaccination is generally discouraged except for specific groups: older adults (\u226565\u202fyears) and pregnant women in the first or second trimester should avoid July/August unless later vaccination is uncertain; children who need two doses should start as early as possible, even in July/August, to allow a second dose \u22654\u202fweeks later; pregnant women in the third trimester may be vaccinated in July/August because it protects infants. Vaccine selection guidelines state that children \u226418\u202fyears, pregnant women, and all adults should receive single\u2011dose formulations free of thimerosal. Adults \u226565\u202fyears are preferentially recommended to receive a high\u2011dose or adjuvanted vaccine (HD\u2011IIV3, RIV3, or aIIV3). LAIV3 is not recommended for pregnancy, immunocompromised persons, or those with certain medical conditions, and is contraindicated for ages <2 or >49\u202fyears. Contraindications include a history of severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component; egg allergy is a labeled contraindication for egg\u2011based IIV3s and LAIV3, but the CDC recommends that all persons with egg allergy receive an appropriate influenza vaccine. The guidance also details dosing schedules for children 6\u202fmonths\u20138\u202fyears who may need one or two doses depending on prior vaccination history, and specifies intramuscular administration volumes (0.5\u202fmL for most, 0.25\u202fmL for certain Afluria doses).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 11:48 AM\nSource:[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7432a2.htm)\n\n**US FDA Approves Updated COVID\u201119 Vaccines with New Restrictions**\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved updated COVID\u201119 vaccines for the fall season, but imposed new eligibility restrictions. The agency will allow vaccination for people aged 65 and older, and for younger individuals only if they have at least one underlying health condition. Healthy children under 18 may receive the vaccine after a doctor's consultation. However, a newly restructured advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must recommend use, and the committee has been altered to include vaccine skeptics. The approval marks the first fall\u2011winter season in which widespread vaccination of the general public and children is not recommended, putting the Trump\u2011era federal health officials at odds with national medical bodies.

The FDA\u2019s limited authorization covers two mRNA vaccines: Moderna, authorized for people 6\u202fmonths and older with underlying conditions and all over 65, and Pfizer, authorized for the same age groups starting at 5\u202fyears. The FDA also revoked emergency use authorizations for child\u2011specific formulations, making Pfizer unavailable for those under 5.

The meeting was marked by the inclusion of an inaccurate and outdated presentation about thimerosal, which unscientifically affected the subsequent flu vaccine vote. The ACIP voted 5 to 2 in favor of clesrovimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody for infants, for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, the committee failed to discuss and vote on the HPV vaccine, and no vote was taken for COVID vaccines. The FDA announced the new 2025-2026 COVID vaccine formula, a monovalent JN.1 lineage, preferably using the LP 8.1 strain. Two new COVID vaccine products have been fully licensed by the FDA: a protein-based vaccine, Nuvaxovid by Novavax, and Moderna's new lower-dose mRNA COVID vaccine, mNEXSPIKE. HHS Secretary Kennedy issued a directive removing COVID vaccines from the immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, citing no new evidence to support the decision. The CDC staff gave updates on COVID epidemiology and vaccine safety and effectiveness at the meeting. The ACIP's decision to remove thimerosal from flu shots for children, pregnant women, and adults may have unintended consequences, including reducing the availability of multidose flu vaccine and increasing vaccine hesitancy. The new ACIP chair plans to reevaluate the childhood immunization schedule, the birth dose of Hep B, and the use of MMR and varicella vaccines for young children, which could further upend the child and adult vaccine schedules and sow mistrust in vaccines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/acips-june-meeting-glaring-omissions-and-shocking-addition-2025a1000i3k)\n\n**FDA gives Covid vaccine manufacturers instructions for next fall's shot**\nThe FDA has instructed Covid vaccine manufacturers to update their vaccines to target the LP.8.1 strain of the virus for the fall 2025 season, in an effort to more closely match the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

The panel ultimately voted unanimously to recommend that the 2025-2026 vaccine target a JN.1 version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The FDA's new policy, outlined in a proposed regulatory framework, also suggests that Covid vaccines will only be available to people who are at high risk of severe illness from Covid, and that manufacturers will be asked to produce human immunogenicity data to support approval of any updated product. The agency has not indicated how large those studies will need to be.

The committee ultimately voted unanimously to target the JN.1 version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the 2025-2026 vaccine, but was divided on whether to update the version. The FDA has not yet made a decision, but is leaning towards recommending the LP.8.1 subvariant. The agency also announced that it is requiring Pfizer and Moderna to put expanded warning labels on their products to warn of the risk of myocarditis, a rare side effect.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 10:57 PM\nSource:[STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/22/fda-advisory-panel-split-on-whether-agency-should-require-updates-of-covid-19-vaccine/)\n\n**FDA panel debates COVID vaccine recipe as questions swirl about fall shots**\nThe FDA is meeting to discuss updating COVID-19 vaccines for the fall and winter seasons, amidst a new policy that has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots. The policy, announced by the FDA just two days prior to the meeting, limits routine approval of COVID-19 boosters to seniors and those at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to conduct new studies to determine whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people under 65. 'This is a mess,' said an infectious disease expert, citing concerns that the new policy may prevent parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to. The FDA is also considering whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna, and. Current data suggests that the virus continues to cause 'enormous burden' on the healthcare system, with 30,000 to 50,000 adults dying from COVID-19 since October. The CDC's Dr. noted that older adults account for most hospitalizations and deaths, but COVID-19 is also a major cause of pediatric hospitalization, especially in children under 2. The decision on strain updates is not the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated, as the CDC's advisory panel will meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 05:54 PM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/NOVAVAX-INC-58256108/news/FDA-panel-debates-COVID-vaccine-recipe-as-questions-swirl-about-fall-shots-50039034/)\n\n**COVID-19 Vaccines for Use in the United States Beginning in Fall 2025**\nThe FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) met on May 22, 2025, to discuss and recommend COVID-19 vaccine compositions for use in the United States beginning in fall 2025. The committee unanimously voted to recommend a monovalent JN.1-lineage vaccine composition, with a preference for the LP.8.1 strain. This decision was based on the totality of evidence, including manufacturing timelines, SARS-CoV-2 virus variant circulation, current vaccine effectiveness, and human immunogenicity data. FDA has advised manufacturers to produce monovalent JN.1-lineage-based COVID-19 vaccines (2025-2026 Formula) to match currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The agency will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/covid-19-vaccines-2025-2026-formula-use-united-states-beginning-fall-2025)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasters express an extremely high probability that the FDA will approve at least one seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2025-2026 flu season before October 1, 2025. Their consensus, with final probability estimates between 95% and 99%, rests on the following key points:\n\n- The FDA has an uninterrupted five-decade record of approving updated seasonal flu vaccines annually on time, with strong institutional inertia and standardized processes that are difficult to disrupt.\n\n- The main risk factors this year stem from unprecedented political and regulatory upheaval: cancellation of the VRBPAC meeting, restructuring/dismissal of federal advisory committees, withdrawal from the WHO, appointment of vaccine-skeptical officials to high-level public health roles, and anti-vaccine rhetoric. All experts acknowledge these as serious and highly unusual threats, but they primarily see the risk as affecting future years or other vaccines (notably COVID-19), not this flu season\u2019s process, which was mostly complete before recent turbulence.\n\n- Multiple independent, credible news sources (CDC, MMWR, mainstream media) confirm that the FDA approved the 2025-26 flu vaccine formulation on March 13, 2025. Manufacturers have produced and are distributing vaccines, and public campaigns recommend vaccination, all signaling that regulatory approval is intact.\n\n- While the advisory committee disruptions and political interventions are factored in as slightly decreasing the probability, every expert emphasizes there's no direct evidence of rescinded or delayed approval for the influenza vaccine for the 2025-26 season. The regulatory machinery, base rates, and public health imperatives render an outright break in this annual cycle extremely unlikely within the short time period until October 1.\n\n- Forecasters only hedge marginally below certainty to accommodate the unlikely but imaginable scenario of a last-minute, unprecedented regulatory reversal\u2014something for which there is no sign in any public reporting.\n\nIn summary, despite a uniquely chaotic regulatory and political environment, all available evidence and process signals point to a YES resolution, with the FDA approval already granted and new flu shots being manufactured and distributed as usual. The experts\u2019 forecast probabilities cluster tightly at 95-99%, reflecting overwhelming but not absolute confidence in a YES outcome.",
