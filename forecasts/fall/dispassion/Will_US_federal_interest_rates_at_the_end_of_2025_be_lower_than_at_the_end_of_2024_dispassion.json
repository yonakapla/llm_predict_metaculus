The FOMC's own projections and market expectations both anticipate two more 25bp cuts before year-end, supported by recent data showing labor market deterioration (multiple negative payroll indicators, rising unemployment, downward revisions). While inflation remains above target and some FOMC members are cautious, there is no evidence of an inflation breakout that would force a halt. The main risk to further cuts is a data surprise (e.g., much higher inflation) or a dramatic policy shift, both of which are currently low-probability scenarios. Technical factors (tracking the effective, not the target, rate) are unlikely to derail the resolution, as the effective rate closely follows the target in the current regime. Thus, the probability that the effective federal funds rate on December 31, 2025, is below 4.33% is high, though not quite certain, given policy risk and unknowns around inflation.

Public communications from voting members frame further cuts as likely but emphasize a data-driven approach; unless inflation surprises to the upside or the labor market rebounds sharply, the base case is for the effective rate to fall below the 4.33% threshold by end-2025. Base rates for Fed cutting cycles and the current macro trajectory reinforce this view.

FOMC statements and minutes reveal ongoing concern about inflation risks and the consequences of a premature easing that could force a painful reversal later. Furthermore, the current environment of data uncertainty (due to the shutdown) and heightened political scrutiny may cause even a dovish-leaning FOMC to slow or pause cuts to avoid accusations of political bias or loss of credibility.

The group process also highlighted that while inflation risk is real, there is currently little to suggest an imminent, sharp reacceleration that would meaningfully disrupt the path to a lower year-end rate. Thus, I am moving my probability up to be more in line with the consensus high-confidence view, while still not going to the absolute maximum to allow for tail risks.",

Additionally, the market's strong consensus (as reflected in futures and the yield curve) is a powerful real-time aggregator of all available information and should be given considerable weight. While I still see real risks from inflation and internal Fed caution, the momentum of both public and market signals points to further easing, and the risk of a complete halt or reversal before year-end is lower than initially assessed. As such, I am revising my probability upwards to better reflect the strong macro-financial consensus and the empirical regularity of Fed easing cycles.",

Despite these concerns, Goolsbee emphasized that underlying economic fundamentals support gradual rate reductions. Speaking on CNBC\u2019s 'Squawk Box,' he questioned the assumption that inflation would decline on its own without policy action. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had previously voted in September to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, with participants signaling potential additional cuts of two more reductions by year-end. Goolsbee\u2019s remarks came on the day the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was scheduled to release September nonfarm employment data, which was delayed due to the government shutdown. His staff\u2019s estimates indicated that the unemployment rate remained unchanged in September, suggesting labor market stability.

This decline was fueled by multiple indicators: the ADP payroll report showed two consecutive months of declining employment, the first such occurrence since Q2 2020; the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) revealed a significant drop in voluntary resignations; and the Challenger report indicated a slowdown in hiring. These data points collectively reinforced the perception of a notable labor market downturn, prompting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to resume its rate cut cycle in September 2025. Additionally, the prolonged US government shutdown, maintained by Congress, threatens economic activity and may lead to public sector job cuts. Uncertainty also surrounds the delayed release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) jobs report, further amplifying negative market sentiment.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.34%) has historically trended higher over the long term, but short-term corrections may occur if corporate earnings decline. The Fed\u2019s two primary mandates are price stability (targeting 2% annual CPI inflation) and supporting a healthy jobs market, though it does not set a specific unemployment target. As of August, CPI was rising at an annualized rate of 2.9%, down from a 40-year high of 8% in 2022, but still above the 2% target. The labor market has shown signs of deterioration: July saw only 73,000 new jobs created (below the expected 110,000), and May and June figures were revised down by 258,000 combined. August added just 22,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.3%. The September jobs report, due on October 3, is expected to show 50,000 new jobs; a lower number would make an October rate cut highly probable. The Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) indicates a consensus for a rate cut in October and another in December. The CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool reflects an 89% probability of a cut in October and a 71% chance in December. Lower interest rates typically benefit stocks by reducing borrowing costs, encouraging corporate investment, and pushing investors toward riskier assets like equities. However, if rate cuts are driven by a weak economic outlook or recession fears, the S&P 500 may decline in the short term despite the supportive monetary policy. Rising unemployment suggests businesses are hesitant to hire, potentially signaling slower growth and reduced consumer spending, both of which could hurt corporate earnings. Despite short-term volatility, the S&P 500 has always trended upward over the long term, making temporary declines potential buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic selling.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/when-federal-reserve-cut-interest-rates-means-stoc/)\n\n**Fed\u2019s Goolsbee: Rate Cuts Should Not Be Rushed**\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee expressed caution on Friday, October 3, 2025, regarding the pace of interest rate cuts, citing rising inflation and deteriorating employment data that are placing simultaneous pressure on the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate of price stability and low unemployment.

The ongoing government shutdown has disrupted public economic activity and raised the risk of job losses, leading to the postponement of the September Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) jobs report. As a result, markets relied on a series of negative private-sector economic indicators, including an unexpected stall in the U.S. services sector according to the ISM PMI, continued contraction in the labor component of the survey, declining ADP payrolls, a drop in voluntary quits from the JOLTS report, and reduced hiring as noted in the Challenger report.

This delay raises concerns about the ability to accurately assess current economic conditions and respond with timely policy measures. Prior to the shutdown, the Department of Labor had already identified the Bureau of Labor Statistics as a non-essential agency. If the shutdown continues, other scheduled economic data releases, including the September Consumer Price Index on October 15, may also be affected. In 2013, a similar government shutdown delayed dozens of economic reports, including employment data. Recent U.S. economic indicators show a clear slowdown in the labor market: non-farm employment numbers fell below market expectations in both July and August. Additionally, the Department of Labor revised downward the annual growth rate of employment for the period through March in a provisional update. Despite these signs of economic weakening, the Federal Reserve (FRB) decided in September to resume interest rate cuts to support the economy. However, concerns remain over inflationary pressures due to 'Trump tariffs,' complicating future policy decisions. The FRB's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet on October 28\u201329 to discuss monetary policy. Chicago Fed President Goolsbee stated on September 30 that it is 'regrettable' to lack access to official economic data during a critical turning point in the economy.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 09:11 AM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20251003/k00/00m/030/244000c)\n\n**U.S. Economy on the Brink: Structural Challenges Outweigh Temporary Relief from Interest Rate Cuts**\nThe U.S. economy faces deep structural challenges despite recent interest rate cuts, according to experts. Persistent issues include massive budget deficits, rising public debt, housing affordability crises exacerbated by past rate hikes, and a shrinking labor force due to demographic trends like an aging population and declining birth rates. While lower interest rates may offer temporary relief, they are insufficient to address these fundamental problems. The Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy alone cannot overcome economic uncertainty driven by unpredictable trade policies, fiscal mismanagement, automation replacing labor, and consumer pessimism. Long-term economic stability depends on policymakers confronting these root issues rather than relying solely on interest rate adjustments. Historical context shows that rate cuts have provided short-term stimulus but failed to resolve underlying structural weaknesses. The U.S. public debt has grown exponentially, limiting government investment in education, infrastructure, and research\u2014critical for long-term growth. The housing affordability crisis, rooted in the 2008 financial crisis, continues to hinder household wealth accumulation, geographic mobility, and financial stability. Additionally, the declining labor force reduces productivity, risks labor shortages, and increases wage pressures. The article cites Lorie Logan, President of the Dallas Fed, who stated in May 2024 that 'it is too early to think about lowering interest rates,' emphasizing that inflation must reach the Fed\u2019s 2% target before any pivot. Key upcoming dates include the Jackson Hole Symposium (August 21\u201323, 2024), a potential Fed rate cut meeting in September 2024, and the end of the fiscal year in January 2025.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 10:16 PM\nSource:[nouvelles-du-monde.com](https://www.nouvelles-du-monde.com/etats-unis-leconomie-au-bord-du-precipice-une-paralysie-gouvernementale-pourrait-etre-fatale/)\n\n**Wall Street Ignores Possible Shutdown Impacts and Closes with Triple Record**\nWall Street closed with a triple record on Thursday, October 2, 2025, despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown that began on Wednesday, October 1, due to a lack of agreement between Democrats and Republicans. The S&P 500 reached its 29th closing high of the year, surpassing 6,700 points for the first time, while the Dow Jones also broke its previous record. The shutdown, which delayed key economic data such as the upcoming payroll report, is expected to be short-lived. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the shutdown could 'affect economic growth' and criticized the approach, stating, 'This is not how you discuss: paralyze the government and reduce GDP.' Despite this, market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut remained high, with a 97.8% probability of a 0.25 percentage point reduction at the FOMC meeting on October 29, down slightly from 99.4% the previous day. The current federal funds rate stands at 4.00% to 4.25% annually. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan emphasized caution in future rate cuts, noting inflation remains above target and rising, stating, 'We need to be very cautious about rate cuts going forward and ensure we calibrate policy appropriately to avoid over-flexibilizing conditions and having to reverse course, which would be very painful in restoring price stability.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 08:14 PM\nSource:[Money Times](https://www.moneytimes.com.br/wall-street-2-10-25-lils/)\n\n**US 10-Year Yield Falls Further | Forex News 2025.10.02 (en)**\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell below 4.1% on October 2, 2025, driven by growing concerns over economic growth and signs of a weakening labor market.

The shutdown has raised fears that the political deadlock could impede economic growth, particularly as it threatens the release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) jobs report scheduled for the following day. This uncertainty intensified negative sentiment already present due to recent private labor data: ADP-tracked payrolls declined for two consecutive months\u2014the first such decline since Q2 2020\u2014and the JOLTS report showed a significant drop in voluntary job quits, while the Challenger report indicated a slowdown in hiring. These indicators collectively signal a substantial deceleration in the US labor market, prompting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to resume its rate-cutting cycle last month. Despite ongoing inflation concerns, futures markets now anticipate two additional Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 01:32 PM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2764060)\n\n**Here's When the Federal Reserve Is Expected to Cut Interest Rates Again, and What It Means for the Stock Market | The Motley Fool**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate for the first time in 2025 on September 17, citing weakness in the labor market as a sign of potential economic slowdown. The S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.34%) has historically trended higher over the long term, but short-term corrections may occur if corporate earnings decline. The Fed\u2019s two primary mandates are price stability (targeting 2% annual CPI inflation) and supporting a healthy jobs market, though it does not set a specific unemployment target. As of August, CPI was rising at an annualized rate of 2.9%, down from a 40-year high of 8% in 2022, but still above the 2% target. The labor market has shown signs of deterioration: July saw only 73,000 new jobs created (below the expected 110,000), and May and June figures were revised down by 258,000 combined. August added just 22,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.3%. The September jobs report, due on October 3, is expected to show 50,000 new jobs; a lower number would make an October rate cut highly probable. The Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) indicates a consensus for a rate cut in October and another in December. The CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool reflects an 89% probability of a cut in October and a 71% chance in December. Lower interest rates typically benefit stocks by reducing borrowing costs, encouraging corporate investment, and pushing investors toward riskier assets like equities. However, if rate cuts are driven by a weak economic outlook or recession fears, the S&P 500 may decline in the short term despite the supportive monetary policy. Rising unemployment suggests businesses are hesitant to hire, potentially signaling slower growth and reduced consumer spending, both of which could hurt corporate earnings. Despite short-term volatility, the S&P 500 has always trended upward over the long term, making temporary declines potential buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic selling.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/when-federal-reserve-cut-interest-rates-means-stoc/)\n\n**Fed Cuts Rates for First Time This Year, Signals Monetary Easing Cycle**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a 4.00%\u20134.25% range, the first cut since December\u202f2024.  The move aims to support employment amid slowing growth while inflation remains above the 2% target.  In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted that recent indicators show \"the growth of employment has slowed, while inflation, although it has eased somewhat, remains high.\"  The decision was approved by a majority of the committee, though not unanimously; Stephen I.\u202fMiran advocated a 50\u2011basis\u2011point cut, while the rest favored a gradual approach.  The Fed\u2019s internal forecasts, shown in the accompanying dot plot, suggest two additional cuts in 2025, likely in October and December, but President Jerome\u202fPowell emphasized that policy will remain data\u2011dependent, saying \"the monetary policy will continue to be data\u2011driven.  We will evaluate each meeting based on the evolution of employment and inflation.\"  Fox Business reports the median FOMC forecast for the end of the year points to a rate near 3.5%, implying a smoother path than some analysts expect.  Markets reacted mildly, with Reuters noting that \"the Fed\u2019s decision comes with warnings: it is not an aggressive easing signal, but a calibrated adjustment.\"  The rate cut will lower variable loan and credit card rates, providing relief to borrowers, but will also reduce the yield on savings and fixed\u2011term deposits, as Fox Business summarized: \"Borrowers win, but savers lose.\"  The Fed\u2019s policy rate influences the cost of money worldwide; lowering it stimulates credit and consumption but risks reigniting inflation, while raising it cools demand and helps control prices, albeit at the cost of slower growth and employment.  Analysts warn that the Fed faces a delicate balance: \"The risk is that the Fed loosens too early and inflation stalls at uncomfortable levels, or that it does so too late and the labor market deteriorates sharply,\" according to an Investopedia report.  Upcoming inflation and employment data before the October and December meetings will determine whether the Fed proceeds with further cuts or pauses.  Powell reiterated the priority of maintaining credibility, stating \"our commitment to price stability and full employment remains unshakable.\"\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[EL DEBER](https://eldeber.com.bo/economia/la-reserva-federal-de-estados-unidos-baja-tasas-por-primera-vez-en-el-ano-y-anticipa-un-ciclo-de-alivio-monetario_530508)\n\n**Fed Cuts 25 Basis Points, Signals Two More Cuts This Year**\nOn September 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.00%\u20134.25%, the first cut of 2025 and the sixth since 2024.

The statement marked a shift in tone compared with July, emphasizing that the risk of a downturn in employment has risen. The committee removed the July phrase about \u2018pure export changes continuing to affect data\u2019 and instead noted that recent indicators suggest a slowdown in economic activity in the first half of the year. It acknowledged that employment growth had slowed and unemployment had risen slightly but remained low, a departure from the July assessment that the labor market was \u2018steady\u2019. Inflation was described as having risen and remaining somewhat high, reflecting a recent rebound. The FOMC reiterated its dual mandate of maximum employment and 2% inflation, noting that the employment downside risk had increased. The rate cut was justified by this heightened risk. The statement also confirmed that the Fed will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury and agency securities, continuing quantitative tightening. The language around future rate adjustments was streamlined, dropping the word \u2018timing\u2019 from the July wording.

The decision marks the first rate cut of 2025 and follows a period of unchanged rates since December 2024. The FOMC statement noted that economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year, job gains had slowed, the unemployment rate had edged up but remained low, and inflation had risen and remained somewhat elevated. Chairman Jerome Powell described the cut as a \u2018risk management cut\u2019 and emphasized that the labor market should not soften further. Powell also said there was no widespread support for a 50\u2011basis\u2011point cut. Stephen Miran was the sole dissenting vote, preferring a half\u2011point cut. The Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) now projects a median federal funds rate of 3.6% by year\u2011end, with two additional quarter\u2011point cuts expected in 2026 and 2027, and a 3% median rate by 2028. GDP growth projections were raised to 1.6% in 2025, 1.8% in 2026, and 1.9% in 2027, while the unemployment rate forecast for 2025 remains at 4.5% and is lowered to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% in 2027. Market reaction was muted: the Dow rose 300 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.9%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.4%. Treasury yields fell, with the 10\u2011year yield dropping more than 3 basis points to below 4% for the first time since April. White House officials, including President Trump, Peter Navarro, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have called for more aggressive rate cuts, with some advocating a 50\u2011basis\u2011point cut in September and a cumulative 150\u2013175 basis\u2011point reduction by year\u2011end.

It cites the Federal Open Markets Committee\u2019s (FOMC) reliance on the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) monthly Non\u2011Farm Payrolls (NFP) data, which the author claims has been overstated by large benchmark revisions.  The article notes that the BLS\u2019s 2024 preliminary revision lowered the March 2024 job count by over 800,000 and the 2025 revision lowered March 2025 by more than 900,000, for a cumulative downward revision of 1.7\u202fmillion jobs between March\u202f2023 and March\u202f2025.  These revisions suggest the labor market was weaker than the NFP figures implied, potentially undermining the Fed\u2019s justification for the 11 rate hikes between 2022\u20112023 that were predicated on a tight labor market.\n\nThe piece also highlights the growing public\u2011sector share of job growth\u2014over one in five new U.S. jobs since early 2023\u2014and the rise of independent contracting, with more than 60\u202fmillion gig workers (\u224836\u202f% of the workforce) and a projected 50\u202f% share by 2027.  It argues that the BLS\u2019s survey\u2011based methodology cannot capture these rapid shifts, calling for a real\u2011time, data\u2011driven census that would provide a more accurate NFP figure for monetary policy.\n\nThe author frames the Fed\u2019s decision as a dilemma between cutting rates to support a weakening economy and holding rates to counter tariff\u2011driven inflation, noting that the latest BLS Producer Price Index showed a 0.1\u202f% month\u2011on\u2011month decline and a 2.6\u202f% annualized increase, indicating a cooling of producer prices.  The article concludes that eliminating reliance on voluntary surveys and adopting integrated, AI\u2011powered data streams would reduce the risk of a \"data\u2011driven\" policy based on a \"faulty map\".\n\nKey metrics cited: 0.1\u202f% month\u2011on\u2011month PPI decline, 2.6\u202f% annualized PPI increase, 800,000\u2011job downward revision (2024), 900,000\u2011job downward revision (2025), 1.7\u202fmillion\u2011job cumulative revision, 13\u201115\u202f% public\u2011sector workforce share, 60\u202fmillion gig workers (36\u202f% of workforce), 50\u202f% gig share projected by 2027.\n\nQuotes used: 'faulty foundation', 'illusion', 'faulty premise', 'data\u2011driven policy that is, in fact, based on a faulty map'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 05:03 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffgapusan/2025/09/17/the-data-driving-todays-anticipated-fomc-interest-rate-cut/)\n\n**Pre\u2011market: Week to Feature Copom and Fed Meetings**\nThe article reports that investors are anticipating the upcoming meetings of Brazil\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) and the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  For Brazil, the consensus is that the Selic reference rate will remain at 15% per year at least until the end of 2025; options on Copom traded on B3 on 12 September showed a 95% probability of maintaining the current rate, which has been unchanged since 20 June.  In the United States, investors expect the Federal Reserve to resume interest\u2011rate cuts after the pause in December 2024.  The Fed Funds rate is currently 4.25%\u20114.50% per year, and most estimates call for a 0.25\u2011percentage\u2011point cut, with a 5% chance of a 0.50\u2011point cut.  The most common scenario projects a total 0.75\u2011point reduction by the end of 2025, potentially spread over three 0.25\u2011point cuts in September, October, and December, or a single 0.5\u2011point cut followed by a pause.  U.S. inflation remains above target, but employment is slowing faster than expected.  The August core Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.1% YoY, matching July\u2019s reading and expectations.  Non\u2011farm payroll data for August showed 22,000 new jobs, while July\u2019s revised figure was 79,000, up from the preliminary 73,000.  A semi\u2011annual review of March\u2011March 2024\u20112025 revealed 911,000 fewer job openings than projected, a 50% higher shortfall than the 2024 median estimate of 600,000 and the largest since 2002; on average, the U.S. economy created 76,000 fewer jobs per month than expected.  These employment trends may justify more pronounced rate cuts by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Since lowering interest rates in December 2024, the Fed has maintained the benchmark rate in four consecutive meetings. The SEP (Summary of Economic Projections) released alongside the decision lowered the growth rate forecast for this year, increased the unemployment rate, and raised the inflation forecast. The end-of-year target rate, however, remained at 3.9%, which is 0.6 percentage points below the current policy rate ceiling of 4.5%, leaving room for potential rate cuts in the second half of the year. However, the end-of-year target rates for 2026 and 2027 were raised. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell mentioned that the Trump administration's tariffs could lead to significant inflationary pressures in the US. Despite the current 2% inflation rate, Powell is concerned about the potential for prices to rise later due to the tariffs. He expects this to happen 'over the summer.' The recent surge in international oil prices due to the Israel-Iran conflict could also contribute to inflation in the US. If the conflict is resolved quickly and oil prices fall, the impact on inflation may be limited. However, if oil prices continue to rise, it could lead to higher energy and transportation costs, as well as higher prices for goods. This could lead to a decrease in consumer purchasing power, reduced consumption, and decreased sales for companies. Companies may respond by reducing investment and hiring, leading to higher unemployment and lower economic growth. The Fed may lower interest rates to defend the economy, but this is now expected to happen in the third quarter or later, rather than in the second quarter as previously anticipated.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 22, 2025 08:03 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025062215561)\n\n**Federal Reserve Interest Rates: Current Trends and Economic Impact in June 2025**\nThe Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in the US economy by setting interest rates that affect borrowing costs, inflation, and economic growth. As of June 2025, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. The Fed uses various tools to keep the federal funds rate within its target range, including changing the interest paid on reserve balances and adjusting its overnight reverse repurchase facility. These technical adjustments have real-world consequences, affecting consumer wealth and confidence by influencing the rates we pay for loans and receive on our savings. The Fed aims for a 2% inflation target over the long run and uses interest rate adjustments as the primary tool to maintain this balance. When inflation rises too quickly, the Fed typically raises interest rates to cool the economy and bring price increases under control. Conversely, when inflation falls below target or economic growth slows, the Fed can lower rates to stimulate activity. The Fed's interest rate decisions affect many aspects of the economy and financial markets, including mortgage rates, consumer spending, business investment, and the employment market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is responsible for setting the federal funds rate target, and its decisions are closely watched by financial markets. The FOMC meets approximately eight times per year to assess economic conditions and make monetary policy decisions. The Fed's interest rate policy has a significant impact on the US economy, affecting borrowing costs, inflation, and economic growth. Lower rates make loans cheaper, encouraging businesses to invest and consumers to spend on big purchases like homes and cars. Stock markets often react strongly to Fed decisions, generally favoring rate cuts. However, excessive rate cuts can lead to inflation concerns if the economy overheats. The job market responds to rate changes, with lower rates typically boosting employment over time. Higher rates can cool an overheated job market but might increase unemployment if applied too aggressively.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 19, 2025 12:25 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@naodanhluon/federal-reserve-interest-rates-current-trends-and-economic-impact-in-june-2025-3e4a53064ef3)\n\n**Fed holds interest rates steady, signals two cuts likely later in 2025**\nThe Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%, but signaled two rate cuts are likely before the end of 2025. The decision came as the central bank faces rising inflation and slowing economic growth, and amid pressure from former President Donald Trump to ease monetary policy. Markets had widely expected no change, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) approved the decision unanimously. However, the 'dot plot' projections suggested diverging views among policymakers about the path ahead. The committee trimmed expectations for further cuts in 2026 and 2027, and seven of the 19 policymakers indicated no support for any cuts this year, highlighting growing divisions within the Fed. The median forecast now sees the federal funds rate at approximately 3.4% by 2027, underlining persistent uncertainty about the central bank's long-term policy direction. 'Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated,' the committee said, adding that it remains alert to risks on both inflation and employment fronts. Economic projections released alongside the policy decision point to stagflationary risks, with officials lowering their 2024 GDP growth forecast to 1.4% and revising up inflation estimates to 3%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 18, 2025 06:29 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/18/fed-holds-rates-steady-signals-two-cuts-ahead-despite-inflation-pressures/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts assign a high probability (ranging from 75% to 88%) that the US federal interest rate (as measured by the Effective Federal Funds Rate) on December 31, 2025 will be lower than at the end of 2024 (4.33%). The consensus expectation stems from several converging factors: 1) The Federal Reserve began a rate-cutting cycle in September 2025, lowering the effective rate to 4.00\u20134.25%, and has signaled two additional 25bp cuts by year-end, reflected in FOMC statements, dot plots, and forward guidance; 2) Labor market data show clear deterioration (rising unemployment, weak payrolls), justifying further easing under the Fed's dual mandate; 3) Financial markets (yield curve, futures, swaps) overwhelmingly anticipate more cuts, with the 10-year Treasury yield dropping below 4.1%; 4) Persistent but not accelerating inflation creates some caution among policymakers, with FOMC divisions and recent inflation upticks tempering the expectation for aggressive cuts but not derailing the base case for additional easing. Major risks identified include a sudden inflation shock (due to supply disruptions, tariffs, or energy), a surprise rebound in labor markets, or prolonged uncertainty from government shutdowns delaying key data, potentially leading to a Fed pause. Public choice and political cycle analyses highlight institutional inertia, risk-aversion, and political pressures as factors that may slow but not halt the easing trajectory. Most experts judge the dominant scenario to be two further rate cuts by year-end, resulting in an effective rate at or below ~3.75\u20134.00%, comfortably under the 4.33% threshold. The strong consensus, backed by historical Fed behavior, current macro trends, and market pricing, is that a 'Yes' resolution is highly likely, with assigned probabilities clustering in the mid-80s percent range.",
