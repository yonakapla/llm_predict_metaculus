Moreover, short-term YoY GDP figures are usually more path-dependent and less sensitive to slow-moving TFP trends or structural convergence than to sectoral or regional outperformance (e.g., Madrid's ongoing surge). Furthermore, there is little compelling evidence that the Eurozone core will accelerate rapidly enough by Q3 2025 to produce outright convergence in annual growth rates.

They accurately reference real-time GDP metrics (Spain\u2019s Q2 2025 +2.8% YoY vs EZ +1.5%), appropriately highlight mean reversion concerns, and distinguish between ongoing Spanish momentum and the possibility of (so far absent) rapid Eurozone core catch-up. Their explicit weighting of the slow-changing status quo versus the tendency for forecasters to overshoot mean reversion in sub-annual horizons helps buttress the logic of a high\u2014but not total\u2014probability. Importantly, this perspective fits OCA theory\u2019s own observation: monetary union constrains adjustment and tends to preserve existing growth differentials over medium horizons when asymmetric shocks persist. The critique of models that either overstate or understate convergence risk is justified here; for this exact time window, and given the actual outturn and forecasts, MacroeconomicModeling\u2019s estimate is solidly evidence-based and finely balanced, neither too optimistic nor overly skeptical."

They rightly highlight that Spain's cyclical growth advantage is rooted in sectoral and demographic dynamics\u2014such as labor force participation and tourism\u2014while also giving appropriate weight to tapering effects from EU funds and the narrowing margin of outperformance predicted by institutional forecasts. Importantly, their forecast appreciates the inertia typical in short-term headline growth figures: one year is rarely long enough for deep structural convergence across the Eurozone to erase a persistent GDP gap, barring a major shock. Their interpretation is prudent, recognizing both Spain's vulnerabilities and its strong quarter-by-quarter performance, and integrates empirical forecasts, status quo bias, and base rate logic. This approach merits endorsement as it neither succumbs to extrapolation bias nor overstates mean reversion effects in the immediate term."

Their acknowledgment that headline GDP is relatively insensitive to deep structural weaknesses (unemployment, low productivity, inequality) in such a short horizon is methodologically sound, as these are important for long-term integration debates but not for 1-year YoY forecasts. By combining a nuanced reading of macro data, forward-looking risks, and theoretical debate about Eurozone convergence, they justify a high (88%) probability while displaying prudent skepticism about 'extreme' claims.

From the convergence/divergence debate perspective, this underestimates the persistence of cyclical divergence specific to the post-pandemic Eurozone. Spain\u2019s superior growth for several years has been characterized by inertia and sectoral momentum\u2014especially given service sector strength and regional (e.g., Madrid) 'growth engines'\u2014as well as institutional lag in the absorption of EU-level shocks. Additionally, for a forecast horizon of merely one more quarter (Q3 2024 to Q3 2025 YoY), headline GDP differences are typically sticky and subject to pronounced path dependency. This means the sizeable gap as of Q2 2025 is unlikely to close fully in such a short window unless core Eurozone countries massively outperform expectations or Spain undergoes an acute negative shock, neither of which is signaled by available data or baseline forecasts. Thus, while the RBCT perspective aids in long-term scenario planning, it is overly cautious for this near-term, year-on-year, data-driven contest."

My original weighting of mean reversion and Spanish headwinds arguably discounted the strong short-term path dependence evident in recent trends and institutional projections.

While the status quo, base rates, and model/institutional forecasts overwhelmingly support Spanish outperformance, the consistent caution by both the ESM/policy-focused forecasters and balance of payments experts regarding cyclical narrowing, diminishing tailwinds, and the potential for modest Eurozone surprise underscore a modestly higher risk of the gap closing than my initial reasoning allowed for.

Most notably, even more conservative forecasts (e.g., ESM at 73%) do not introduce significant new reasons for downside revision, while the critiques of Real Business Cycle Theory highlight the relative insensitivity of near-term YoY GDP to deep structural mean reversion. There is consensus that stickiness in growth differentials, sectoral momentum (especially services/labor/tourism-driven growth), and institutional inertia all support persisting Spanish outperformance for at least this window. Since there were no major arguments or evidence indicating increased risks of sharp Spanish deceleration or Eurozone-wide renaissance during this period, I maintain my initial probability.

Economy Minister Carlos\u202fCuerpo said the challenge is to \"translate that economic growth into social improvements\" and to keep \"progressing\" amid a structural change.  Economist Eduardo\u202fGarz\u00f3n warned that projections can fail and that the GDP figure does not capture quality of life, adding that he is more concerned with unemployment, wages and inflation.

The analysts, led by strategist Silvia Aldana, cite growing concerns that the ECB\u2019s medium\u2011term inflation target of 2\u202f% will remain below that level for an extended period.  They argue that these concerns will be reinforced by a slowdown in real GDP growth in the second half of 2025, a weaker currency, a deceleration in nominal wage growth, and updated forecasts that show inflation falling below 2\u202f% in at least part of 2026 and 2027.  The analysts also note that the euro\u2011area economy is not in a good state but is expected to improve, with real GDP projected to stagnate in Q3 2025 and grow only 0.1\u202f% in the final quarter of 2025.  They foresee acceleration next year as the negative impact of tariff hikes and trade\u2011related uncertainty eases and monetary and fiscal policy support strengthens.  Growth is expected to rebound in Germany, France and Italy, while Spain is projected to slow due to a pull\u2011back from multi\u2011year trends, stabilisation of immigration inflows and lower absorption of EU post\u2011pandemic recovery funds.  The ECB left policy rates unchanged this month because inflation is broadly on target but economic and political outlooks remain uncertain.  The ECB cut its main deposit rate to 2\u202f% in June, halving the previous peak of 4\u202f% over a year, but has paused the rate\u2011cut cycle.

The data also show that Spain\u2019s GDP rose 0.7\u202f% in the same period, a 0.1\u202f% increase over the first\u2011quarter figure, and that the year\u2011on\u2011year growth rate was 2.8\u202f%, matching the first\u2011quarter level but 0.5\u202f% below the fourth\u2011quarter 2024 figure.  Among the 27 EU member states with available data, the strongest growth rates were reported by Denmark (1.3\u202f%), Croatia and Romania (1.2\u202f% each) and Bulgaria (0.9\u202f%).  In contrast, Finland\u2019s GDP fell 0.4\u202f%, Germany declined 0.3\u202f% and Italy slipped 0.1\u202f% in the second quarter.  The United States also posted a 0.8\u202f% rise in GDP for the second quarter, following a 0.1\u202f% contraction in the preceding period that was attributed to a surge in imports ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 09:34 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/economia/macroeconomia-00338/noticia-pib-eurozona-freno-avance-segundo-trimestre-01-coincidiendo-guerra-arancelaria-20250905113438.html)\n\n**Eurozone Growth Remains Stronger Than Expected, Reducing Need for ECB Rate Cuts**\nThe economic growth of the eurozone remained better than expected in the second quarter, indicating that companies are adapting to commercial uncertainty, which may reduce the need for further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) to stimulate the block. The GDP of the 20 countries that share the euro grew by 0.1% in the quarter, exceeding expectations of no change, as Spain, France, and Ireland continued to grow above expectations, offsetting the weakness of Germany and Italy, according to Eurostat data published on Wednesday. In comparison with the second quarter of the previous year, the economy of the block grew by 1.4%, above the expected 1.2%. Although the data still indicates a significant deceleration compared to the 0.6% expansion in the first quarter, that figure was skewed by pre-anticipated imports from US companies before the implementation of new tariffs and did not reflect the real economic strength. However, if examined together, the two first quarters indicate resilience, supported by the latest PMI reading, which showed that business activity accelerated more rapidly than expected, driven by a solid improvement in services and the continued recovery of the manufacturing industry. Spain continued to stand out, with a quarterly expansion of 0.7%, while French growth, at 0.3%, also exceeded the average. On the other hand, Italy and Germany retreated by 0.1%, according to Eurostat data. Furthermore, the US reached a trade agreement with the European Union, reducing uncertainty and improving growth prospects, especially since agreements have also been reached with other major powers, such as Japan and the UK. Although these agreements involve higher tariffs, which could reduce eurozone growth by 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points annually, according to economist estimates, this impact has already been taken into account in most forecasts. Additionally, Germany plans to drastically increase its public spending from next year to finance infrastructure and defense, a growth stimulus that will compensate for much of the impact of the tariffs, economists argue. This economic resilience is a key factor why financial investors believe that the ECB is about to end its easing of borrowing costs after reducing its official interest rate to 2% over the past 13 months. Markets only see a 50% chance of another cut by December and a small possibility of interest rates starting to rise by the end of 2026 as the economy accelerates and price pressure begins to rise again, according to economists.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/economia/crecimiento-zona-euro-mantiene-mejor-previsto-2t-20250730-770434.html)\n\n**Eurozone Economy Exceeds Expectations with 0.1% GDP Growth in Q2 2025**\nThe European Statistical Office (Eurostat) released the preliminary Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the European Union (EU) and the Eurozone.

The GDP also increased by 1.5% compared to the same period last year. The market expectation and the preliminary data published by Eurostat earlier showed that the GDP in the Eurozone would increase by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and 1.2% year-on-year. The growth data exceeding market expectations and the upward revision of preliminary data drew attention. In the EU, the seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter and 1.6% year-on-year in the first quarter. The GDP in Germany increased by 0.4% compared to the previous quarter, while it remained unchanged in France, increased by 0.3% in Italy, and by 0.6% in Spain compared to the previous quarter.

In the first quarter of 2025, seasonally adjusted GDP grew by 0.6% compared to the previous quarter, and by 1.5% compared to the same quarter last year. This is a faster pace of growth than expected, which was 0.3% and 1.2% respectively. The European Central Bank's president, Christine Lagarde, has suggested that a pause in interest rate cuts may be justified in July. According to Eurostat, the growth was driven by investments and exports, which has strengthened expectations that the ECB will take a more cautious approach to further interest rate cuts. 'The economy of the eurozone has achieved better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2025, with growth driven mainly by investments and exports, which has strengthened expectations that the ECB will take a more cautious approach to further interest rate cuts,' Eurostat said. In comparison, the US GDP fell by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter, and grew by 2.1% compared to the same quarter last year. The highest growth rate in the eurozone was recorded in Ireland (+9.7%), followed by Malta (+2.1%) and Cyprus (+1.3%). Poland recorded a growth rate of +0.7%, ranking it fourth among the countries that exceeded the average.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 10:26 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/gospodarka/polska-gospodarka-rosnie-ponad-srednia-unijna-jest-zaskoczenie/lzb06qs)\n\n**Euro Area GDP Rises 0.6% in Q1 2025, Despite Uncertainty Over Trump Tariffs**\nThe European Union's Eurostat agency has reported that the euro area's GDP (PIL) increased by 0.6% on a quarterly basis and 1.5% on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This is an upward revision from the preliminary estimate of 0.4% on a quarterly basis and 1.2% on an annual basis. The data was released after the European Central Bank (BCE) announced its eighth interest rate cut since June 6, 2024, as part of its efforts to combat high inflation in the eurozone. The BCE also updated its economic growth projections for 2025-2027, forecasting a real GDP growth rate of 0.9% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026, and 1.3% in 2027. According to the Eurotower, 'the unchanged growth projection for 2025 reflects a more vigorous first quarter performance than expected, associated with weaker prospects for the rest of the year.' While there is some uncertainty about the impact of Trump's tariffs on the euro area's economy, the BCE believes that the increase in real incomes and a robust labor market will allow households to spend more, and that favorable financing conditions will increase the economy's resilience to global shocks. However, the BCE also presented a worst-case scenario in which the impact of Trump's tariffs is more severe than expected.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 09:16 AM\nSource:[Money.it](https://www.money.it/pil-euro-i-trimestre-rivisto-al-rialzo-ma-attenti-al-worst-case-scenario-della-bce-con-dazi-trump)\n\n**Eurozone GDP Growth Accelerates to 0.6% in First Quarter of 2025**\nThe eurozone's GDP growth accelerated to 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025, more than double the 0.3% recorded in the last quarter of 2024.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is strong consensus that Spain is highly likely to grow faster than the Eurozone as a whole over the period from Q3 2024 to Q3 2025. The base rate and recent momentum show Spain outpacing the Eurozone by around 1\u20132 percentage points annually, with current (Q2 2025) figures reinforcing the trend: Spain at 2.8% year-on-year growth versus the Eurozone at 1.5%. Most institutional forecasts (Bank of Spain, FUNCAS, ECB, Barclays) project Spain\u2019s 2025 growth at 2.7\u20132.8%, with Eurozone growth at 1.0\u20131.2%. Key positive factors for Spain include strong labor market expansion (often fueled by immigration), resilience and dynamism in services and tourism, robust regional (Madrid) growth, and ongoing (if fading) effects from EU recovery funds. However, experts consistently warn that Spain\u2019s outperformance is expected to decline due to mean reversion: diminishing tailwinds, waning EU funds, stabilization of migration, and core Eurozone economies (notably Germany, France, Italy) forecast to recover modestly in late 2025, potentially narrowing the growth gap. Structural weaknesses in Spain (high unemployment, low productivity) are seen as limiting long-term sustainability but not enough to erase the short-term advantage. Downside scenarios typically require a rapid Spanish slowdown or an unexpectedly strong Eurozone core rebound\u2014neither of which is currently supported by data or forecasts. Final probability estimates across experts cluster in the 73\u201388% range, with most assigning 83\u201387% odds to Spain outgrowing the Eurozone. All experts agree that a Yes outcome (Spain outgrows Eurozone) is strongly favored, though not absolutely certain, due to possible mean reversion and late-period shocks.",
