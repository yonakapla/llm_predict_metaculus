It's true that the field is deep and the absence of some super-elites opens opportunities, but the probability of both finalists being from the top 10 remains significant, and the introduction of many young prodigies could just as easily result in early exits due to inexperience.

Gukesh, along with 49 other top-50 players including Indian stars Arjun Erigaisi and R Praggnanandhaa, received a first-round bye and will enter the tournament in Round 2. The draw sets up a potential final between Gukesh and either Arjun Erigaisi or Praggnanandhaa if both progress to the final. The tournament, held at Resort Rio in Arpora, Goa from November 1 to 26, features 206 players in a knockout format. After 156 players compete in Round 1, the 78 winners join the top-50, forming a 128-player knockout bracket. Each round consists of two games with Standard time controls (25+10), with tie-breaks reduced to 15+10, followed by 10+10, 5+3, and 3+2 games, culminating in an Armageddon tie-break if needed. The top three finishers qualify for the Candidates Tournament, where the winner will challenge Gukesh for the world title. Notable absentees include Magnus Carlsen, who withdrew from the world championship cycle after declining to defend his title in 2023, and Hikaru Nakamura, who is focusing on securing a Candidates spot via lower-rated tournaments. Fabiano Caruana, who qualified via the 2024 FIDE Circuit, has also withdrawn.

The match featured top players including reigning Classical World Champion D. Gukesh and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura. The event concluded controversially when Nakamura, after defeating Gukesh in a Bullet tie-break following two draws, picked up Gukesh's king and threw it toward the crowd. This gesture sparked debate: some viewed it as an attempt to energize the exhibition and promote chess in the U.S., while others criticized it as disrespectful, particularly given Gukesh's youth and status as world champion. In stark contrast, Gukesh remained composed, calmly resetting the board after the game\u2014a behavior consistent with his reserved and humble demeanor, shared by other young Indian stars like Arjun Erigaisi and R. Praggnanandhaa. Arjun Erigaisi lost to world No. 3 Fabiano Caruana, and Divya Deshmukh, the FIDE Women's World Cup winner, lost to International Master Carissa Yip despite being higher-ranked.

The event, which began in 2025 with a $60,000 prize pool and Andrey Rublev as the top seed, has evolved into a major spectacle with a $1 million Australian dollar (approximately $656,100 USD) prize. The format involves a rock-paper-scissors draw to determine matchups, followed by a single point contested between a professional and an amateur. In the inaugural event, Rublev was eliminated in the quarterfinals after hitting his serve into the net. The winner that year, Omar Jasika, defeated Priscilla Hon in a 35-shot rally, demonstrating that even 'one point' matches can be prolonged and intense. The 2025 edition features Alcaraz, currently ranked world number one, competing against 10 amateurs who hope to win a life-changing sum. The tournament includes five knockout rounds, culminating in a final at Rod Laver Arena during a night session. The event blends spectacle and unpredictability, offering amateurs a chance at fortune and professionals the risk of public embarrassment. As described by Yardbarker, the format appeals to the 'David versus Goliath' narrative, with the potential for dramatic upsets despite the overwhelming skill gap.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 08:38 AM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/tennis/articles/carlos_alcaraz_is_about_to_make_someone_rich_and_probably_embarrass_himself_in_the_process/s1_17396_42865481)\n\n**Knockout Stage Begins at 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile**\nThe knockout stage of the 2025 FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Chile began with two matches: a daytime European clash between Ukraine and Spain, and a nighttime match between host nation Chile and Mexico. Ukraine finished undefeated in Group B with seven points, securing first place via wins over South Korea (2-1) and Paraguay (2-1), and a 1-1 draw with Panama. Spain, in contrast, had a difficult path in Group C, qualifying as one of the best third-place teams after a 0-2 loss to Morocco, a 2-2 draw with Mexico, and a 1-0 win over a disappointing Brazil squad. Chile, as hosts, placed second in Group A with two losses and one win\u2014matching Egypt and New Zealand in record\u2014but advanced due to FIFA\u2019s tiebreaker favoring better sportsmanship. Mexico earned its spot with two draws (against Brazil and Spain) and a surprising 1-0 victory over Morocco. All subsequent matches are single-elimination, with tied games going to two 15-minute extra time periods without a break. If still tied, a penalty shootout follows in two phases: five shots per team, then sudden death until a winner is determined.

India, seeded second, used the flexibility to give most players match experience, fielding different combinations in doubles and singles.

Unnati Hooda, a China Open quarterfinalist, noted the need to adjust her pre-match routine due to the lack of warm-up time between matches in the 45-point format.

Giri\u2019s decisive final\u2011round win over Hans Niemann, who needed a victory, secured his place in the Candidates. The top finishers were Giri 8, followed by Bl\u00fcbaum, Keymer and Alireza Firouzja at 7.5 each; Firouzja did not attend the bronze\u2011medal ceremony.

The U.S. champion Fabiano Caruana has already qualified via the 2024 FIDE circuit, and Hikaru Nakamura is poised to secure a rating spot. The 2025 World Cup in Goa will decide the remaining Candidates places.

The tournament also offers a spot for the highest Fide\u2011rated player who has completed 40 rated classical games. World No.\u202f2 Hikaru Nakamura, who still needed 22 of the 40 after eight games in the American Cup and 10 in Stavanger, sparked controversy last weekend by entering the Louisiana State Championship, where he won all seven games against opponents rated 2250\u20131563, compared with his own 2807 rating. Caruana, Nakamura and Praggnanandhaa are almost assured of qualification; Samarkand will decide two more spots, while the remaining three will come via the World Cup knockout in Goa, India, in November. The opening round saw a high percentage of draws, but Gukesh delivered a star performance as Black against France\u2019s No.\u202f3 \u00c9tienne Bacrot, grinding down his opponent and producing an exchange sacrifice at the right moment. He will face 14\u2011year\u2011old Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus in round two.

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts, there is a strong consensus that the structure of the FIDE World Cup\u2014a large, single-elimination knockout with rapid/blitz tiebreaks\u2014introduces considerable variance and increases the likelihood of upsets compared to other major chess tournaments. Multiple experts cited the historical base rate, noting that in recent editions (notably 2019, 2021, 2023), at least one finalist was seeded outside the top 10, and in some cases, both finalists were outsiders. The withdrawal of several super-elite, traditionally dominant players (Carlsen, Caruana, Nakamura) further levels the playing field and opens the path for lower seeds, particularly with many strong grandmasters and rapidly improving prodigies just outside the top 10. While some experts highlighted that the top 10 remain formidable\u2014benefitting from round 1 byes, bracket protections, home advantage (for Indian stars), and greater experience\u2014most agreed these advantages are not enough to prevent outsiders from making deep runs in the volatile World Cup format. Bracket structure and the emergence of wildcards or underrated young talents are additional contributing factors. On average, experts assigned a probability well above 50%\u2014with the majority clustering between 60\u201368%, one forecasting as high as 85%, and a minority in the low 40s. The main rationale across forecasts is that the combination of historical upset frequency, field depth, and the tournament\u2019s unique volatility makes it more likely than not that at least one World Cup finalist will be seeded outside the top 10 in 2025.",
