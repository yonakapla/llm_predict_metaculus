Critiques of lower forecasts (e.g., 37% or 43%) highlight that these underweight both the high variance of the event and the modern depth of the field. Defenses of forecasts in the 58\u201365% range stress that, while the top 10 are strong, the knockout format, tiebreak-induced volatility, and base rates from recent events make a non-top-10 finalist more likely than not. No compelling arguments emerged for probabilities above 70%, as such estimates may overextrapolate from only two recent cycles and underweight status quo inertia. My initial 62% was near the group\u2019s consensus midpoint. However, the deliberation nudged me slightly higher, given repeated, well-supported arguments about the unique volatility of this World Cup and the specific absence of some of the most upset-resistant players. Therefore, I will revise my forecast modestly upward.",

Gukesh, along with 49 other top-50 players including Indian stars Arjun Erigaisi and R Praggnanandhaa, received a first-round bye and will enter the tournament in Round 2. The draw sets up a potential final between Gukesh and either Arjun Erigaisi or Praggnanandhaa if both progress to the final. The tournament, held at Resort Rio in Arpora, Goa from November 1 to 26, features 206 players in a knockout format. After 156 players compete in Round 1, the 78 winners join the top-50, forming a 128-player knockout bracket. Each round consists of two games with Standard time controls (25+10), with tie-breaks reduced to 15+10, followed by 10+10, 5+3, and 3+2 games, culminating in an Armageddon tie-break if needed. The top three finishers qualify for the Candidates Tournament, where the winner will challenge Gukesh for the world title. Notable absentees include Magnus Carlsen, who withdrew from the world championship cycle after declining to defend his title in 2023, and Hikaru Nakamura, who is focusing on securing a Candidates spot via lower-rated tournaments. Fabiano Caruana, who qualified via the 2024 FIDE Circuit, has also withdrawn.

The match featured top players including reigning Classical World Champion D. Gukesh and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura. The event concluded controversially when Nakamura, after defeating Gukesh in a Bullet tie-break following two draws, picked up Gukesh's king and threw it toward the crowd. This gesture sparked debate: some viewed it as an attempt to energize the exhibition and promote chess in the U.S., while others criticized it as disrespectful, particularly given Gukesh's youth and status as world champion. In stark contrast, Gukesh remained composed, calmly resetting the board after the game\u2014a behavior consistent with his reserved and humble demeanor, shared by other young Indian stars like Arjun Erigaisi and R. Praggnanandhaa. Arjun Erigaisi lost to world No. 3 Fabiano Caruana, and Divya Deshmukh, the FIDE Women's World Cup winner, lost to International Master Carissa Yip despite being higher-ranked.

The event, which began in 2025 with a $60,000 prize pool and Andrey Rublev as the top seed, has evolved into a major spectacle with a $1 million Australian dollar (approximately $656,100 USD) prize. The format involves a rock-paper-scissors draw to determine matchups, followed by a single point contested between a professional and an amateur. In the inaugural event, Rublev was eliminated in the quarterfinals after hitting his serve into the net. The winner that year, Omar Jasika, defeated Priscilla Hon in a 35-shot rally, demonstrating that even 'one point' matches can be prolonged and intense. The 2025 edition features Alcaraz, currently ranked world number one, competing against 10 amateurs who hope to win a life-changing sum. The tournament includes five knockout rounds, culminating in a final at Rod Laver Arena during a night session. The event blends spectacle and unpredictability, offering amateurs a chance at fortune and professionals the risk of public embarrassment. As described by Yardbarker, the format appeals to the 'David versus Goliath' narrative, with the potential for dramatic upsets despite the overwhelming skill gap.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 08:38 AM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/tennis/articles/carlos_alcaraz_is_about_to_make_someone_rich_and_probably_embarrass_himself_in_the_process/s1_17396_42865481)\n\n**Knockout Stage Begins at 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile**\nThe knockout stage of the 2025 FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Chile began with two matches: a daytime European clash between Ukraine and Spain, and a nighttime match between host nation Chile and Mexico. Ukraine finished undefeated in Group B with seven points, securing first place via wins over South Korea (2-1) and Paraguay (2-1), and a 1-1 draw with Panama. Spain, in contrast, had a difficult path in Group C, qualifying as one of the best third-place teams after a 0-2 loss to Morocco, a 2-2 draw with Mexico, and a 1-0 win over a disappointing Brazil squad. Chile, as hosts, placed second in Group A with two losses and one win\u2014matching Egypt and New Zealand in record\u2014but advanced due to FIFA\u2019s tiebreaker favoring better sportsmanship. Mexico earned its spot with two draws (against Brazil and Spain) and a surprising 1-0 victory over Morocco. All subsequent matches are single-elimination, with tied games going to two 15-minute extra time periods without a break. If still tied, a penalty shootout follows in two phases: five shots per team, then sudden death until a winner is determined.

The match was played under a new best-of-three relay-scoring format, where each set goes up to 45 points and teams can substitute players between sets.

The field includes five\u2011time world champion Magnus Carlsen, R\u202fPraggnanandhaa, Fabiano Caruano, Azerbaijan\u2019s Nijat\u202fAbasov, China\u2019s women\u2019s champion Ju\u202fWenjun, and 2024 junior champion Kazybek\u202fNogerbek of Kazakhstan, among others such as Hikaru\u202fNakamura, Arjun\u202fErigaisi, VR\u202fAravindh\u202fChithambaram, Nihal\u202fSarin, SL\u202fNarayanan, Vidit\u202fGujrathi and former world champion Viswanathan\u202fAnand. The knockout tournament will run for eight rounds, with each round consisting of two classical games and, if required, rapid and blitz tiebreaks; the top 50 seeds receive a bye into round two. India\u2019s hosting of the event reflects its growing status in elite chess, highlighted by 19\u2011year\u2011old Divya\u202fDeshmukh\u2019s recent women\u2019s title win in Batumi, which earned her a Grandmaster title and a spot in the women\u2019s Candidates. FIDE president Arkady\u202fDvorkovich said, 'India has become one of the strongest chess nations, with outstanding players and passionate fans. After the success of the FIDE Women\u2019s World Cup held in Georgia earlier this year, we are proud to bring the FIDE World Cup to Goa. It will be a celebration of chess, and a unique experience for players and spectators from around the world. The representatives of 90+ countries are expected to take part, and it will be one of the most followed events in chess history.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/goa-to-stage-fide-world-cup-in-octnov-101756220134822.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters broadly agree that the likelihood of at least one player seeded outside the top 10 reaching the 2025 FIDE World Cup final is significantly above 50%, though not a certainty. All experts note the single-elimination, knockout format with rapid/blitz/Armageddon tiebreaks creates a high-variance environment, increasing the probability of upsets and deep runs by lower seeds. The absence of dominant players such as Carlsen, Nakamura, and Caruana further opens the path for non-top-10 seeds, and the current field is considered especially deep\u2014with many strong grandmasters and emerging prodigies seeded outside the top 10. Historical precedent is cited across forecasts: In both the 2021 and 2023 World Cups, at least one finalist came from outside the top 10 seeds, and in 2023, both finalists fit this criterion. While byes for top seeds, structural bracket advantages, and the strength/motivation of the current top 10 (including young Indian stars) slightly mitigate the upset chance, consensus remains that the robust distribution of talent and event-specific volatility make deep outsider runs likely. Final probability estimates given by experts range from a low of ~37\u201343% (from more conservative, base-rate-focused analytics perspectives) through several forecasts in the low 60s, with two forecasters estimating in the upper 60s to ~78%. The most common logic links recent historical base rates, the high variance of the format, key absences, and the chess world's depth. The central scenario for a 'no' outcome is both finalists being from the top 10 (e.g., Gukesh, Erigaisi, Praggnanandhaa), while a 'yes' scenario sees a player outside this group (such as Nepomniachtchi, Dubov, Artemiev, or a wildcard junior) advancing through a combination of upsets and favorable bracket dynamics. In summary, nearly all experts view the chance as well above even-money for at least one non-top-10 seed in the final, with median consensus clustering around 60\u201365%.",
