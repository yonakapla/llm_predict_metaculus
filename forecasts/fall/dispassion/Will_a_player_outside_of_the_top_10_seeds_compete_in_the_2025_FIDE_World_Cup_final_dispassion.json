This is particularly acute when the top-tier favorites (Carlsen, Nakamura, Caruana) are absent, reducing the number of 'anchors' who reliably convert rating edge into deep runs. Additionally, several of the #11\u2013#30 seeds this year are prodigies or fast risers who may be underrated by seeding. While the Indian top 10 contingent is strong, the tournament environment is more conducive than ever to upsets.

Conversely, more conservative estimates (such as 38% or 55%) were viewed as underweighting both historical base rates and the unique combination of factors in 2025: absence of Carlsen, Caruana, Nakamura, a deep field of underseeded prodigies, and a format that amplifies volatility. My original probability of 58% was cautious, sitting just above the empirical base rate. Given the strong, well-reasoned group consensus that this event's structure and recent history support a higher probability, and the robust defenses of 62-65% forecasts, I am revising my probability upwards to 63%. This aligns with the modal expert view and better reflects both historical evidence and the specific field composition for 2025.",

Gukesh, along with 49 other top-50 players including Indian stars Arjun Erigaisi and R Praggnanandhaa, received a first-round bye and will enter the tournament in Round 2. The draw sets up a potential final between Gukesh and either Arjun Erigaisi or Praggnanandhaa if both progress to the final. The tournament, held at Resort Rio in Arpora, Goa from November 1 to 26, features 206 players in a knockout format. After 156 players compete in Round 1, the 78 winners join the top-50, forming a 128-player knockout bracket. Each round consists of two games with Standard time controls (25+10), with tie-breaks reduced to 15+10, followed by 10+10, 5+3, and 3+2 games, culminating in an Armageddon tie-break if needed. The top three finishers qualify for the Candidates Tournament, where the winner will challenge Gukesh for the world title. Notable absentees include Magnus Carlsen, who withdrew from the world championship cycle after declining to defend his title in 2023, and Hikaru Nakamura, who is focusing on securing a Candidates spot via lower-rated tournaments. Fabiano Caruana, who qualified via the 2024 FIDE Circuit, has also withdrawn.

The match featured top players including reigning Classical World Champion D. Gukesh and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura. The event concluded controversially when Nakamura, after defeating Gukesh in a Bullet tie-break following two draws, picked up Gukesh's king and threw it toward the crowd. This gesture sparked debate: some viewed it as an attempt to energize the exhibition and promote chess in the U.S., while others criticized it as disrespectful, particularly given Gukesh's youth and status as world champion. In stark contrast, Gukesh remained composed, calmly resetting the board after the game\u2014a behavior consistent with his reserved and humble demeanor, shared by other young Indian stars like Arjun Erigaisi and R. Praggnanandhaa. Arjun Erigaisi lost to world No. 3 Fabiano Caruana, and Divya Deshmukh, the FIDE Women's World Cup winner, lost to International Master Carissa Yip despite being higher-ranked.

The event, which began in 2025 with a $60,000 prize pool and Andrey Rublev as the top seed, has evolved into a major spectacle with a $1 million Australian dollar (approximately $656,100 USD) prize. The format involves a rock-paper-scissors draw to determine matchups, followed by a single point contested between a professional and an amateur. In the inaugural event, Rublev was eliminated in the quarterfinals after hitting his serve into the net. The winner that year, Omar Jasika, defeated Priscilla Hon in a 35-shot rally, demonstrating that even 'one point' matches can be prolonged and intense. The 2025 edition features Alcaraz, currently ranked world number one, competing against 10 amateurs who hope to win a life-changing sum. The tournament includes five knockout rounds, culminating in a final at Rod Laver Arena during a night session. The event blends spectacle and unpredictability, offering amateurs a chance at fortune and professionals the risk of public embarrassment. As described by Yardbarker, the format appeals to the 'David versus Goliath' narrative, with the potential for dramatic upsets despite the overwhelming skill gap.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 08:38 AM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/tennis/articles/carlos_alcaraz_is_about_to_make_someone_rich_and_probably_embarrass_himself_in_the_process/s1_17396_42865481)\n\n**Knockout Stage Begins at 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile**\nThe knockout stage of the 2025 FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Chile began with two matches: a daytime European clash between Ukraine and Spain, and a nighttime match between host nation Chile and Mexico. Ukraine finished undefeated in Group B with seven points, securing first place via wins over South Korea (2-1) and Paraguay (2-1), and a 1-1 draw with Panama. Spain, in contrast, had a difficult path in Group C, qualifying as one of the best third-place teams after a 0-2 loss to Morocco, a 2-2 draw with Mexico, and a 1-0 win over a disappointing Brazil squad. Chile, as hosts, placed second in Group A with two losses and one win\u2014matching Egypt and New Zealand in record\u2014but advanced due to FIFA\u2019s tiebreaker favoring better sportsmanship. Mexico earned its spot with two draws (against Brazil and Spain) and a surprising 1-0 victory over Morocco. All subsequent matches are single-elimination, with tied games going to two 15-minute extra time periods without a break. If still tied, a penalty shootout follows in two phases: five shots per team, then sudden death until a winner is determined.

The match was played under a new best-of-three relay-scoring format, where each set goes up to 45 points and teams can substitute players between sets. India, seeded second, used the flexibility to give most players match experience, fielding different combinations in doubles and singles. Bhargav Ram Arigela and Viswa Tej Gobburu won the men's doubles 9-3, while Unnati Hooda and Tanvi Sharma secured wins in girls' singles. Unnati Hooda, a China Open quarterfinalist, noted the need to adjust her pre-match routine due to the lack of warm-up time between matches in the 45-point format.

The field includes five\u2011time world champion Magnus Carlsen, R\u202fPraggnanandhaa, Fabiano Caruano, Azerbaijan\u2019s Nijat\u202fAbasov, China\u2019s women\u2019s champion Ju\u202fWenjun, and 2024 junior champion Kazybek\u202fNogerbek of Kazakhstan, among others such as Hikaru\u202fNakamura, Arjun\u202fErigaisi, VR\u202fAravindh\u202fChithambaram, Nihal\u202fSarin, SL\u202fNarayanan, Vidit\u202fGujrathi and former world champion Viswanathan\u202fAnand. The knockout tournament will run for eight rounds, with each round consisting of two classical games and, if required, rapid and blitz tiebreaks; the top 50 seeds receive a bye into round two. India\u2019s hosting of the event reflects its growing status in elite chess, highlighted by 19\u2011year\u2011old Divya\u202fDeshmukh\u2019s recent women\u2019s title win in Batumi, which earned her a Grandmaster title and a spot in the women\u2019s Candidates. FIDE president Arkady\u202fDvorkovich said, 'India has become one of the strongest chess nations, with outstanding players and passionate fans. After the success of the FIDE Women\u2019s World Cup held in Georgia earlier this year, we are proud to bring the FIDE World Cup to Goa. It will be a celebration of chess, and a unique experience for players and spectators from around the world. The representatives of 90+ countries are expected to take part, and it will be one of the most followed events in chess history.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/goa-to-stage-fide-world-cup-in-octnov-101756220134822.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a broad consensus that the probability of at least one player seeded outside the top 10 reaching the 2025 FIDE World Cup final is meaningfully higher than historical seeding would suggest. Forecasters consistently cite the knockout format\u2014with its short matches and rapid/blitz tiebreaks\u2014as a major driver of upsets and variance, amplifying the likelihood that strong players seeded outside the top 10 can make deep runs. The absence of super-elite anchors like Carlsen, Nakamura, and Caruana flattens the seeding curve, making the top 10 less dominant versus a strong, deep, and young field.\n\nNearly all experts highlight recent precedent (notably Praggnanandhaa's #31 seed final and Abasov\u2019s #69 semifinal appearance in 2023) and estimate the base rate of such upsets as 40\u201360% over the past few World Cups. The expanded and talented field, including prodigies and underseeded wildcards, is considered another upside factor.\n\nThe main countervailing factors are the status quo expectation (top 10 seeds still being individually favored per match), byes for top seeds, and bracket/preparation advantages. Still, most experts judge these are outweighed by the structural volatility of the event and current trends.\n\nProbability forecasts from the group cluster mostly between 55% and 70%, with only a single notably lower estimate (38%). The central scenario for a 'Yes' outcome involves a strong non-top-10 seed (such as Nepomniachtchi, Dubov, or a rising prodigy) riding favorable pairings, peak form, or tiebreaks to the final, while the 'No' scenario envisions top 10 seeds consistently advancing as favorites.\n\nIn summary: Experts believe it is more likely than not (generally 55\u201370%) that at least one finalist will be seeded outside the top 10, based on base rates, tournament format, field composition, and recent FIDE World Cup history.",
