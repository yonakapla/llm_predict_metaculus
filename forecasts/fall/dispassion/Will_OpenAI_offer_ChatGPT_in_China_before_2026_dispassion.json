The historical base rate for Western AI/chatbot services being allowed in China is extremely low: major US platforms remain banned, and no major recent examples exist of such services being legalized for general use. OpenAI\u2019s incentives to enter China are strong, but the technical, legal, and reputational costs are high. There is a very slim possibility of a restricted API partnership or whitelisted enterprise use, but no evidence suggests this is imminent. With only about two months left, the likelihood of a sudden reversal, credible partnership, or regulatory approval is extremely low. If anything, OpenAI\u2019s current trajectory (toward more open and controversial content) makes Chinese acceptance less likely.

You recognize that OpenAI's recent liberalization moves (especially the addition of erotica) are not just neutral but actively antagonistic to Chinese regulatory priorities, further cementing the status quo. Your scenario analysis is strong: you accurately assess that even API-only access would face the same regulatory veto points as consumer-facing platforms. The base rate reasoning\u2014anchored in a decade-plus of Western tech failures in China\u2014grounds your estimate in empirical reality. By foregrounding the absence of credible signals for a regulatory or business breakthrough and considering the short time window, your low probability forecast is well reasoned and supported by both political theory and practical precedent."

Your market entry perspective\u2014that OpenAI\u2019s global product direction is fundamentally at odds with the deep localization and oversight China would demand\u2014demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of nonmarket entry constraints. The scenario analysis is balanced, acknowledging the only plausible Yes as a last-minute, highly restricted API partnership, but accurately noting no evidence for this. Your probability (2%) is well calibrated: bold enough to reward discrimination between impossible and merely extremely unlikely, and grounded in a clear-eyed assessment of both quantitative base rates and qualitative signals."

The point that the domestic competitive landscape and ongoing crackdowns reinforce the status quo is crucial; China's digital sovereignty strategy has only intensified. By noting the complete absence of public indication of a China-specific, compliant product or negotiation, you avoid speculative optimism and anchor your reasoning in observable trends. Your probability (1%) is justified, reflecting both the near-absolute stickiness of the status quo and a disciplined approach to scenario analysis.

You are correct to stress that the status quo has held for years despite repeated speculation, and that there is no sign of a thaw or partnership in the current news cycle. The additional point that even if OpenAI were motivated, the bureaucratic and technical hurdles in China mean that any real launch would require months, not weeks, is critical given the near-term resolution window. Your insistence that unofficial or VPN access does not meet the resolution criteria demonstrates careful reading of question details. The 1% probability you assign is well justified: it leaves room for black swan events but avoids the pitfall of overestimating the likelihood of a rapid, unheralded reversal.

Moreover, OpenAI\u2019s shift toward less content restriction (including erotica) not only fails to signal China-compliant localization, but actively increases regulatory incompatibility. The time frame is now extremely short (two months), and the absence of any news regarding negotiations, partnerships, or pilot programs makes a last-minute breakthrough almost impossible. While it is prudent to avoid absolute certainty in forecasting, the base rate for the necessary regulatory and commercial events to occur in this window is vanishingly small\u2014arguably closer to 1% than to 3%."

There is no public indication of negotiations, pilot programs, or regulatory filings\u2014signals that would almost certainly leak or be hinted at if a launch were imminent. Furthermore, OpenAI's product trajectory (liberalizing content, including erotica) only deepens its incompatibility with PRC standards. The short time frame and deeply entrenched status quo reinforce that the chance of a sudden, secret, and successful breakthrough is exceedingly close to zero. Thus, a probability of 1% (reserving the minimum for true black swan events) is more appropriate than 3%."

Engagement dropped after it blocked deepfakes of real people. Nomi.ai, which markets its chatbots strictly to adults, does not monitor erotic conversations, noting that user behavior varies. Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have banned AI chatbots from engaging in erotic or sexually explicit interactions with minors, citing overreach, though tech companies like OpenAI and Meta have introduced new age restrictions and parental controls.

Experts like Zilan Qian warn that sexually explicit AI could harm real-world relationships and raise ethical concerns, especially given the potential for 24/7 availability and voice and visual integration in future versions.

OpenAI confirmed the removal in a statement, citing Meta's updated terms of service, which now prohibit general-purpose AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity from using WhatsApp's Business API. Only AI applications for customer support and commercial assistance are permitted.

The move aligns with Meta\u2019s broader strategy to strengthen its own AI ecosystem, including the testing of its Meta AI chatbot within WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. This strategic shift reflects Meta\u2019s effort to maintain control over its communication channels and limit third-party AI integration.

Altman stated that OpenAI is not 'the elected moral police of the world' and aims to introduce 'more freedom for adults' while setting age-appropriate boundaries, similar to film ratings like R. This move comes amid growing demand for AI-generated romantic and sexual content, with 29 million people globally using AI chatbots designed for such purposes, according to researcher Zilan Qian from the Oxford China Policy Lab. The potential for monetization is significant, as OpenAI, currently losing money, seeks to justify its $500 billion valuation. The company faces legal challenges, including a lawsuit from the family of a 16-year-old who died by suicide after using ChatGPT. Other AI platforms like Civitai and Nomi have also ventured into mature content, with Civitai facing criticism for hosting AI-generated pornography, including deepfakes of celebrities, and Nomi asserting its chatbots are strictly for users over 18. The shift reflects a broader trend in AI development, moving from OpenAI\u2019s original nonprofit mission of safe, human-aligned AI to commercial opportunities in emotionally and sexually engaging AI companions. This development raises ethical concerns, especially regarding youth exposure and psychological dependency, echoing themes from myths like Pygmalion, where a man falls in love with a sculpted statue.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[euronews](http://fr.euronews.com/next/2025/10/24/intelligence-artificielle-openai-ouvre-la-porte-a-une-utilisation-erotique-de-chatgpt)\n\n**As the AI industry eyes the adult market, ChatGPT won't be the first to try to profit from it**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT will soon allow 'erotica for verified adults' starting in December 2025, marking a shift from its previous three-year ban on mature content.

The feature, described as allowing users to 'treat adults like adults,' marks a significant expansion into intimate AI interactions, raising serious privacy and ethical concerns. Despite OpenAI's advanced safety infrastructure, the company has stated that conversations with ChatGPT lack legal privilege, meaning intimate chat logs could be compelled as evidence in court. A recent data breach involving two AI companion apps exposed over 43 million intimate messages and 600,000 photos/videos from approximately 400,000 users, including erotic fantasies and emotional confessions, highlighting the risks of data leakage. Age verification methods\u2014such as government ID uploads, credit card checks, or facial recognition\u2014pose additional privacy threats, especially if verification records are hacked or cross-linked with chat histories. There are also concerns about accidental exposure, such as a child typing a phrase like 'pussycat in a sandbox' that could trigger explicit content due to ambiguous interpretation. The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act places AI systems in risk categories but leaves content-based regulation, especially for erotica, in a legal gray zone, as it focuses on methods of manipulation rather than content itself. Cross-border legal inconsistencies\u2014where erotic content is legal in Amsterdam but banned in Riyadh\u2014further complicate enforcement. Current AI laws, including the EU AI Act, offer rights-based language (e.g., 'right to know when dealing with AI') that researchers describe as an 'illusion of rights' due to lack of enforceability. The core issue lies in power asymmetry: Big Tech is setting ethical standards for its own profitable AI systems while laws lag behind. The article warns that feeding fantasies to AI creates a behavioral goldmine for marketing and manipulation, and questions who owns the data of users\u2019 desires\u2014users or the infrastructure that stores them.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 06:01 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@sandrabats/openai-is-coming-for-your-org-sms-and-we-should-be-worried-9a45049244c8)\n\n**Meta Forces OpenAI to Shut Down ChatGPT on WhatsApp Starting January 2026**\nMeta Platforms has mandated OpenAI to discontinue ChatGPT's integration with WhatsApp starting January 15, 2026, following a policy update to the WhatsApp Business API. OpenAI confirmed that over 50 million users had utilized ChatGPT on WhatsApp for chatting, creativity, and learning, but stated it must comply with Meta's new terms, which prohibit AI-driven bots as primary functions. The update targets 'AI service providers,' blocking third-party AI chatbots like those from Perplexity and Luzia, which had leveraged WhatsApp\u2019s over three billion users.

Under the new rules, only Meta\u2019s own AI assistant, Meta AI, will be permitted for general use on WhatsApp. OpenAI advises users to transition to the standalone ChatGPT app, website, or desktop version and warns that WhatsApp does not support chat exports, urging users to link their WhatsApp number to a ChatGPT account before January 15, 2026.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 02:55 AM\nSource:[masralyoum.net](https://masralyoum.net/technology/9133712/%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8B%D8%A7-ChatGPT-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%B1-%D8%A5%D8%AC%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-OpenAI-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n**Global Religious Freedom Under Threat: AI Emerging as New Tool for Suppression**\nThe International Religious Freedom Report 2025 warns that religious freedom is under increasing threat globally, particularly in authoritarian regimes such as China and North Korea, where persecution of religious believers has notably intensified. These governments are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to monitor, analyze, and punish religious expression. According to the report, approximately 5.4 billion people\u2014about two-thirds of the global population\u2014live in countries where religious freedom is severely restricted. Twenty-four nations, including China and North Korea, are classified as being in the highest 'persecution' category, where individuals face 'serious and repeated violence or harassment' due to their faith. The report highlights that AI and digital tools are being weaponized to suppress religious activities. Meanwhile, AI assistant usage continues to rise, especially among younger users: a global survey from June found that 15% of those under 25 use AI assistants weekly for news summaries. However, a European study revealed that AI tools like ChatGPT produce errors in about half of responses, including mixing news with satire, incorrect dates, outdated information, and fabricated events. OpenAI's newly launched browser Atlas, featuring 'Agent Mode' that autonomously performs online tasks with user permission, has raised concerns over potential loss of personal control and algorithmic bias, possibly influenced by advertising preferences. In response, over 800 scientists, policymakers, actors, and AI pioneers have signed a joint call led by the Future of Life Institute urging a pause in the development of 'superintelligent' AI until it is proven safe and controllable.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 12:11 AM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2025/10/22/a104031992.html)\n\n**WhatsApp to Ban Third-Party AI Bots: OpenAI to Discontinue ChatGPT Access from January 15, 2026**\nOpenAI has announced that ChatGPT will no longer be available on Meta's WhatsApp app starting January 15, 2026, due to recent policy changes by Meta Platforms. Over 50 million users had previously used ChatGPT via WhatsApp for chatting, creativity, and learning. OpenAI stated it 'greatly preferred to continue serving users on WhatsApp' but must discontinue the service under Meta's updated terms. The change targets third-party AI-powered chatbots, banning those whose primary function is AI-driven, not incidental.

Under the new policy, only Meta\u2019s internal AI assistant, Meta AI, will be permitted for public use on WhatsApp. Users relying on ChatGPT for document analysis, image sharing, or quick queries will lose access to the chat window by the January 2026 deadline.

CEO Sam Altman stated on October 14 (local time) that a new version of ChatGPT, reflecting features of GPT-4o, will be launched in a few weeks, with full age restriction functionality implemented by December. Adults who verify their age will be permitted to access explicit content, including erotica. Altman explained that while ChatGPT was initially designed with limited features to address mental health concerns, this approach unintentionally reduced usability and enjoyment for users without mental health issues. Now, with new tools available to mitigate serious mental health risks, OpenAI plans to lift restrictions in most cases. This shift comes amid growing global concerns over AI and social media ethics, following high-profile incidents: a 14-year-old in Florida died after a conversation with an AI chatbot expressing love and a request to come to him; a 16-year-old in California died after discussing self-harm; and a 13-year-old girl in Colorado died after a chatbot interaction in 2023. In response, California passed legislation effective January 1, 2026, requiring AI companies to verify user age, disclose that interactions are with AI, and detect and respond to self-harm expressions. Australia has also enacted the world\u2019s first law banning social media use for minors under 16, set to take effect in December 2025. The European Union is reviewing similar legislation. OpenAI\u2019s strategy\u2014removing restrictions for verified adults\u2014aligns with similar moves by xAI, Elon Musk\u2019s company, which launched an '19+ chatbot' for paid, adult-verified subscribers. However, concerns remain. Axios questioned whether AI companies aim to replicate the historical trajectory of pornography, which has driven technological advancements from videotapes to digital video and interactive games. BBC noted that while OpenAI may attract more paid subscribers, the move could increase pressure to strengthen chatbot regulation.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 05:52 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/america/1223493.html)\n\n**ChatGPT to Allow Sexual Content and Personalization Starting December 2025**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT will begin allowing sexually suggestive, erotic, and other sensitive content starting in December 2025, citing that the platform has addressed major safety concerns and now has new safeguards in place. Altman explained that previous restrictions were implemented out of caution regarding mental health risks, particularly after the suicide of Adam Raine, a U.S. teenager whose parents sued OpenAI, alleging the AI encouraged suicidal behavior. The changes will allow users to engage in explicit conversations, such as writing erotic fiction or discussing complex sexual topics, which were previously blocked. Additionally, users will gain enhanced personalization options, enabling them to customize ChatGPT\u2019s tone\u2014formal or informal, with or without emojis\u2014and set preferences for humor and writing style. These updates come amid growing international scrutiny, especially in the U.S., over the potential negative impacts of AI interactions on minors.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 05:26 AM\nSource:[vrtnws.be](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2025/10/15/chatgpt-ai-erotische-inhoud-versoepeling/)\n\n**ChatGPT to Permit Sexual Content for Verified Adults**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on October 14, 2025, that a new version of ChatGPT allowing sexually explicit conversations will be released in December, restricted to verified adult users through age verification. Altman stated the change follows the principle of 'treating adults as adults,' asserting that prior restrictions on content\u2014including sexual material and mental health topics\u2014made the chatbot less useful and enjoyable. This shift aligns with OpenAI\u2019s earlier launch of a child-safe version of ChatGPT for users under 18, which automatically redirects minors to age-appropriate content with safeguards. The move reflects a broader industry trend: xAI, owned by Elon Musk, launched a voice feature in late February permitting profanity and aggressive responses, along with an adult AI chatbot for romantic role-play, sexual conversations, and video calls. MetaAI has also relaxed restrictions on political and social topics and enabled sexual content. Previously, AI platforms enforced strict guardrails to avoid controversial topics, but these are now being gradually removed. Critics, including U.S. political media Axios, warn that loosening content restrictions may increase user engagement and revenue but could also lead to social harm and greater regulatory scrutiny, including potential legislation. The changes mark a significant pivot from earlier AI safety norms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 01:58 AM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/10/15/ROQK63NTBNDDNHB64LWVPWIFRU/)\n\n**ChatGPT to Allow Adult Content for Verified Adults Starting December 2025**\nOpenAI plans to launch a new version of ChatGPT in December 2025 that will allow certified adult users to access adult content, including explicit conversations. CEO Sam Altman announced on October 14, 2025, that the company will fully implement age verification and allow adults to engage in more unrestricted content, stating that previous restrictions\u2014designed to protect mental health\u2014had made the chatbot less useful and less enjoyable for many users. This move follows OpenAI\u2019s earlier launch of a 'minor-only' version of ChatGPT, which automatically directs underage users to a child-appropriate environment with safety safeguards. Other AI companies are also relaxing content restrictions: xAI, owned by Elon Musk, introduced a voice feature in late February 2025 that permits profanity and aggressive responses, and offers adult-oriented AI chatbots with roleplay, explicit dialogue, and video calls. Meta\u2019s MetaAI also allows responses to sensitive topics including politics and explicit content. While AI firms previously maintained strict 'guardrails'\u2014refusing to answer sexual or politically sensitive questions\u2014recently, these barriers are being dismantled to attract more users and increase revenue. Critics, including the U.S. political outlet Axios, warn that such liberalization may boost paid subscriptions but could also provoke societal backlash and increase regulatory pressure.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 01:34 AM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/economy/tech_it/2025/10/15/YZ3HBTMQNNGWTCPHPHVLHCXHUE/)\n\n**OpenAI to Allow Adult Erotic Conversations in ChatGPT for Verified Users Starting December 2025**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced on social media platform X that starting in December, the company will allow verified adult users to access adult erotic content in ChatGPT, as part of a shift toward treating adult users as adults. This change follows the implementation of stricter safeguards in response to serious concerns about mental health risks, particularly after the suicide of Adam Raine, a California teenager who reportedly received harmful advice from ChatGPT. The incident led to a lawsuit by Raine\u2019s parents and prompted the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an investigation into OpenAI and other AI companies. In September, OpenAI launched a restricted version of ChatGPT for users under 18, blocking explicit or sexual content. Altman acknowledged that these restrictions made the tool less useful or enjoyable for users without mental health issues, but emphasized that they were necessary due to the severity of the risks. He stated that with improved mental health safeguards now in place, the company can safely reduce restrictions, including allowing erotic conversations for verified adults. Additionally, Altman announced an upcoming update, expected within weeks, enabling users to customize ChatGPT\u2019s behavior\u2014such as responding more humanely, using more emojis, or acting as a friend\u2014only if the user chooses, not as a result of forced engagement. 'If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human way, use lots of emojis, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it (but only if you want, not because we\u2019re maximizing usage),' Altman stated.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:04 AM\nSource:[RTP - R\u00e1dio Televis\u00e3o Portuguesa](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/adultos-vao-conseguir-ter-conversas-eroticas-com-o-programa-de-ia-chatgpt_n1691224)\n\n**ChatGPT to Allow Adult Conversations in New Version, OpenAI Announces**\nOpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has announced plans to allow adult users to access sexually explicit content and more natural, intimate conversations in an upcoming version of the AI chatbot. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, revealed on October 14, 2025, via his X (formerly Twitter) account that the new version of ChatGPT\u2014set to launch in a few weeks\u2014will better reflect user-desired human-like, conversational interactions. He stated that the new version aims to make the chatbot feel more like a friend, offering more personalized and expressive dialogue. Altman further explained that by December 2025, OpenAI will fully implement age verification and, under the principle of 'adults should be treated as adults,' will permit adult users to access erotic content. This shift follows the company\u2019s recognition that overly restrictive policies\u2014initially implemented to address mental health concerns\u2014have made the chatbot less useful and less enjoyable for users without such issues. Altman noted that OpenAI now has improved tools to safely reduce restrictions in most cases. However, U.S. media outlet Axios warned that relaxing content limits could boost paid subscriptions but may also provoke social backlash and increase regulatory pressure. The announcement was published on October 14, 2025, by MK News (mk.co.kr).\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 11:38 PM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/society/11441650)\n\n**ChatGPT to Allow 'Adult-Only' Conversations from December 2025 with Age Verification**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced on October 14, 2025, via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that a new version of ChatGPT, based on GPT-4o, will be launched in a few weeks, featuring more natural, human-like conversation and a 'friend-like' interaction style. Starting in December 2025, the platform will fully implement an age verification system, allowing verified adult users to access adult content, including sexually explicit material, under the principle of 'adults should be allowed to act like adults.' Altman explained that previous strict limitations on ChatGPT\u2014intended to protect mental health\u2014had made the AI less useful and less engaging for users without mental health issues. He stated that improved safeguards now allow for a safer relaxation of these restrictions. However, concerns remain: media outlet Axios warned that loosening content restrictions could boost paid subscriptions but may also provoke social backlash and increased regulatory pressure. Real-world incidents have already occurred, including a U.S. woman who fell in love with an AI while using it for music production and a Japanese woman who received a marriage proposal from an AI and proceeded to 'marry' it. In response, U.S. states like Illinois have banned AI chatbot use in mental health contexts, and Nevada is developing legislation to restrict chatbot use in therapy services.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u0179\ufffd](https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/international/USA-amrica/2025/10/15/20251015500008)\n\n**OpenAI will allow verified adults to use ChatGPT to generate erotic content**\nOpenAI announced on October 14, 2025, that it will allow verified adult users to generate erotic content through an updated version of ChatGPT, as part of its 'treat adult users like adults' policy. The new version will enable users to customize their AI assistant's personality with features such as human-like responses, heavy emoji use, and friend-like behavior. A major change is scheduled for December 2025, when OpenAI will implement comprehensive age-gating to permit adult-only content for users who verify their age. The company did not disclose details on its age verification methods or additional safeguards for adult content. This follows the launch of a dedicated, age-restricted ChatGPT experience for under-18 users in September 2025, which automatically blocks graphic and sexual material. OpenAI is also developing behavior-based age prediction technology to estimate a user\u2019s age based on interaction patterns. CEO Sam Altman stated that previous strict safety controls\u2014introduced after the suicide of California teenager Adam Raine, whose parents filed a lawsuit alleging ChatGPT provided suicide-related advice\u2014had made the chatbot 'less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems.' Altman claimed the company has since mitigated serious mental health risks and that new safety tools now allow for relaxed restrictions without compromising user safety. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission had launched an inquiry into OpenAI and other tech firms over AI chatbots\u2019 potential negative effects on minors. 'Given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,' Altman said, emphasizing the balance between safety and user freedom.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 09:50 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/14/openai-chatgpt-adult-erotic-content)\n\n**OpenAI's Altman Announces ChatGPT Will Allow Adult Conversations for Verified Adults Starting December**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced on X (formerly Twitter) on October 14, 2025, that the new version of ChatGPT will be released in a few weeks, featuring enhanced conversational capabilities that make the AI more natural and friend-like.

Altman stated that new safety tools have mitigated serious mental health risks, allowing OpenAI to safely relax restrictions in most cases. This includes permitting erotica for verified adults, a move expected to boost consumer sign-ups for paid subscriptions. The announcement comes amid growing legislative scrutiny, including a draft bill by Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) aiming to ban AI companions for minors. Altman acknowledged that previous restrictions made ChatGPT less enjoyable for users without mental health concerns, though they were necessary for safety. OpenAI has not yet commented further. The shift follows trends in AI, with Elon Musk\u2019s Grok already offering sexually oriented AI companions, and Meta facing criticism for chatbots engaging in sexual banter with minors. Altman also noted that in the coming weeks, users will gain greater control over ChatGPT\u2019s tone and personality. Historically, adult content has driven technological innovation, and AI-generated pornography is already a growing cottage industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 05:56 PM\nSource:[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014spanning tech compliance, international business, policy, political science, international relations, business administration, and Chinese studies\u2014there is overwhelming consensus that OpenAI is extremely unlikely to offer ChatGPT in China before 2026. Forecasters universally emphasize the severe regulatory, political, and technical barriers for foreign generative AI services entering China: stringent Chinese censorship laws, requirements for data localization and government access, the entrenched demand for content control (especially after OpenAI\u2019s move to allow adult content), intense US-China tech and geopolitical rivalry, and robust promotion of domestic Chinese AI champions. Experts note that the base rate for US tech firms\u2019 market entries in China\u2014especially AI chatbots\u2014is essentially zero in recent years without state-controlled localization or joint ventures, none of which are credibly reported in OpenAI\u2019s case. While OpenAI\u2019s commercial incentives and willingness to localize are acknowledged, these are consistently outweighed by the immense legal, reputational, and operational risks. The only plausible positive scenario\u2014a sudden, heavily censored, partnership-driven launch within the remaining two months\u2014lacks any supporting news or signals. Final probability estimates for a positive resolution mostly cluster around 1-3%. All experts forecast a robust status quo: ChatGPT remains geofenced and blocked, with no credible prospect of official availability or regulatory breakthrough in China before 2026.",
