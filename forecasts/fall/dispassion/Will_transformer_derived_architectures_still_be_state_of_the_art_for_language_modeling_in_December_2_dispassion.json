This approach captures not only technical progress but also the sociotechnical processes that determine what counts as SOTA in practice. The recognition that disruption would require both a technical leap and rapid, broad consensus aligns with historical precedent: architectural transitions (e.g., LSTM to transformer) were visible in leaderboards and benchmark records only after sustained, widespread validation.

Additionally, the field has shown the ability to rapidly update taxonomies (as it did with 'attention' models), so the risk of a near-tie or contentious case, while still small, is not negligible.

The original question opened on 2020-07-27 07:00:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4892). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe transformer architecture was introduced in the landmark 2017 machine learning paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Previously, many researchers believed that the attention mechanism was among the most promising research directions for improving sequence-to-sequence models. Writing in 2015, Christopher Olah [remarked](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/),\n\n> LSTMs were a big step in what we can accomplish with RNNs. It\u2019s natural to wonder: is there another big step? A common opinion among researchers is: \u201cYes! There is a next step and it\u2019s attention!\u201d\n\nThis prediction turned out to be correct. Transformers are generally considered to have unseated LSTM at competitive language modeling, and their central operating principle is using the attention mechanism.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":4892,\"question_id\":4892}}`",

If there is any contention in the Metaculus comment section, a strawpoll will be taken on the subreddit /r/machinelearning asking,\n\n> Is it accurate to say that [the model in question] is a derivative of the transformer model from Vaswani et al.?\n\nAfter one week, a majority vote indicates the answer, with a tie indicating the answer \"Yes\". \n\nEither of these must be true for the question to resolve positively:\n\n1. A Google Scholar search is completed in December 2025 of the phrase \n\n> language model \"state of the art\"\n\nTake the top 5 papers released during the year of 2025.

It begins with the 2017 paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et\u202fal., which introduced the transformer architecture that replaced RNNs with self\u2011attention, enabling efficient long\u2011range context capture. The narrative then follows OpenAI\u2019s GPT series: GPT\u20111 (2018) introduced a two\u2011stage pre\u2011training/fine\u2011tuning pipeline; GPT\u20112 (2019) scaled to 1.5\u202fB parameters and demonstrated zero\u2011shot learning; GPT\u20113 (2020) reached 175\u202fB parameters and added instruction tuning via InstructGPT and RLHF. The 2020 paper on Scaling Laws formalized the relationship between model size, data, and compute, showing that larger models are more sample\u2011efficient.\n\nThe article discusses DeepMind\u2019s Chinchilla (2022), which proved that a 70\u202fB\u2011parameter model trained on more data outperforms larger models such as Gopher (280\u202fB) and Megatron (530\u202fB), recommending a 20:1 tokens\u2011to\u2011parameters ratio. Google\u2019s PaLM (540\u202fB parameters) leveraged the Pathways system for distributed training, while OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT (built on GPT\u20113.5) became the fastest\u2011growing consumer app, marking a shift from open research to commercial deployment.\n\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA series (7\u202fB\u201365\u202fB) introduced data\u2011efficient training and architectural tweaks like rotary embeddings and Grouped Query Attention (GQA). Anthropic\u2019s Claude 2 expanded the context window to 100\u202fK tokens, enhancing long\u2011form reasoning. Mixtral, a French MoE model, activated only 8\u202fB parameters during inference, reducing memory usage. Google\u2019s Gemini added multimodal reasoning, and GPT\u20114 (2023) brought multimodality, improved reasoning, and stronger RLHF alignment, powering ChatGPT Plus and enterprise solutions.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Sora (2024) pushed beyond text with a diffusion\u2011based text\u2011to\u2011video model capable of generating 60\u2011second videos. Meta\u2019s LLaMA\u202f3 (2024) matched GPT\u20114 performance, trained on ~4\u202ftrillion tokens. The 2025 DeepSeek\u2011r1 family emphasized step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning traces and RL\u2011based chain\u2011of\u2011thought alignment, achieving self\u2011correcting behavior. The author notes other notable models (Qwen, Kimi, Grok) and that Kimi has trained a 1\u202fT\u2011parameter model. The blog concludes with a casual sign\u2011off, reflecting its informal tone.\n\nKey metrics cited: 1.5\u202fB parameters (GPT\u20112), 175\u202fB (GPT\u20113), 70\u202fB (Chinchilla), 540\u202fB (PaLM), 100\u202fK\u2011token context (Claude\u202f2), 4\u202ftrillion tokens (LLaMA\u202f3).

It notes that the Transformer architecture, introduced by Google researchers in 2017, eliminated recurrence and convolutions in favor of attention mechanisms, enabling faster and more scalable models. This innovation set new standards in machine translation and laid the groundwork for modern large language models (LLMs) and the emerging field of agentic AI. The timeline highlights key milestones, emphasizing how each step has brought us closer to intelligent, collaborative, and adaptive AI systems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 11:32 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@saidrassai/from-transformers-to-agentic-ai-a-timeline-of-innovation-70794c333b2c)\n\n**MoE vs SSM: Two Paths out of the 'Square Tyranny' of Transformers**\nThe article explains that the transformer\u2019s attention mechanism, with quadratic complexity O(n\u00b2), creates a computational wall it calls \u2018\u0422\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u2019. It describes the problem using the metaphor of a corporate archaeologist who can only analyse one message at a time because the attention window is too small. The author then presents two architectural alternatives that break this wall. First, Mixture\u2011of\u2011Experts (MoE) uses a router to send each token to a handful of specialised experts, reducing per\u2011token compute while allowing the total knowledge capacity to grow to trillions of parameters. However, MoE still requires loading all experts into GPU memory, leading to huge VRAM demands and complex load\u2011balancing. Second, State\u2011Space Models (SSM) process sequences with linear complexity O(n), storing past information in a continuous state. This eliminates quadratic cost and enables long\u2011range context, but as of September\u202f2025 the SSM ecosystem is still immature compared to transformers. The article cites the Mamba architecture as a recent breakthrough in SSM, and notes that by September\u202f2025 both MoE and SSM models have become mainstream. It concludes that the future of AI lies in hybrid systems that combine the strengths of both approaches, rather than relying on a single monolithic transformer.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/articles/949826/)\n\n**14 AI Algorithms You Should Know**\nThe article outlines fourteen AI algorithms, describing their principles, typical use cases, and key characteristics. It begins with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), noting that for more than two classes they are applied pairwise and that a penalty factor can be added for misclassified points, creating a 'soft margin'. It then explains Decision Trees (DTs) as non\u2011parametric supervised learners for classification and regression, highlighting their interpretability but also their tendency to overfit. Random Forest is described as an ensemble of random DTs that aggregates votes or averages probabilities, a form of 'bagging'. XGBoost is presented as a scalable gradient\u2011boosting system that starts with a single tree and iteratively adds trees based on residuals. K\u2011means clustering is introduced as an unsupervised method that partitions observations into k clusters by minimizing within\u2011cluster variance, with Lloyd\u2019s algorithm as the most common heuristic. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is described as a statistical technique that transforms correlated variables into orthogonal, uncorrelated components via eigen\u2011decomposition or singular\u2011value decomposition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are noted for their position\u2011invariant feature extraction in computer vision, using convolutional layers that slide over images and compute dot products. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are explained as feed\u2011forward networks with feedback loops that allow them to model sequences, though they suffer from 'vanishing gradients'. Long Short\u2011Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced as a variant that mitigates this problem with gating mechanisms. Transformers are highlighted as architectures that rely solely on attention mechanisms, enabling them to process long\u2011range dependencies without recurrence or convolution. Finally, Q\u2011learning is described as a model\u2011free, value\u2011based reinforcement\u2011learning algorithm that seeks the optimal action sequence, often combined with neural networks for tasks such as video\u2011game playing or robotics. The article concludes by noting that these algorithms form the foundation of many modern AI applications.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 05:40 AM\nSource:[CIO](https://www.cio.de/article/4061494/14-ki-algorithmen-die-sie-kennen-sollten-2.html)\n\n**The Anatomy of a Transformer Part 1: Building the Encoder**\nThe article explains how the Transformer architecture, introduced in the 2017 paper titled 'Attention Is All You Need', addresses three core problems of language modeling: context, order, and scale.

The architecture blends a hybrid attention mechanism\u201475\u202f% of the layers use linear attention (Gated DeltaNet) to cut memory and compute costs, while the rest use standard attention\u2014making it no longer a pure transformer. It also adopts a slimmed\u2011down mixture\u2011of\u2011experts (MoE) design: 512 experts are available, but only ten are active at a time, so each token prediction requires just 3\u202fbillion parameters.

In inference, the model is noticeably faster on long contexts. Deployment is limited by incompatibility with llama.cpp; it works with the Transformers library, vLLM, and Apple\u2019s MLX framework. Quantisation is essential: the model needs >160\u202fGB RAM unquantised, so AWQ or similar techniques are used. Performance figures: ~20\u202ftokens/s on an RTX\u202f6000\u202fPro with AWQ, ~50\u202ftokens/s on an M2\u202fUltra 4\u2011bit, and ~150\u202ftokens/s via OpenRouter. The Qwen3\u2011Next\u2011Instruct variant is only marginally better on reasoning tasks and is highly restrictive on political queries, often refusing to answer.

It describes the problem using the metaphor of a corporate archaeologist who can only analyse one message at a time because the attention window is too small. The author then presents two architectural alternatives that break this wall. First, Mixture\u2011of\u2011Experts (MoE) uses a router to send each token to a handful of specialised experts, reducing per\u2011token compute while allowing the total knowledge capacity to grow to trillions of parameters. However, MoE still requires loading all experts into GPU memory, leading to huge VRAM demands and complex load\u2011balancing. Second, State\u2011Space Models (SSM) process sequences with linear complexity O(n), storing past information in a continuous state. This eliminates quadratic cost and enables long\u2011range context, but as of September\u202f2025 the SSM ecosystem is still immature compared to transformers. The article cites the Mamba architecture as a recent breakthrough in SSM, and notes that by September\u202f2025 both MoE and SSM models have become mainstream. It concludes that the future of AI lies in hybrid systems that combine the strengths of both approaches, rather than relying on a single monolithic transformer.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/articles/949826/)\n\n**14 AI Algorithms You Should Know**\nThe article outlines fourteen AI algorithms, describing their principles, typical use cases, and key characteristics. It begins with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), noting that for more than two classes they are applied pairwise and that a penalty factor can be added for misclassified points, creating a 'soft margin'. It then explains Decision Trees (DTs) as non\u2011parametric supervised learners for classification and regression, highlighting their interpretability but also their tendency to overfit. Random Forest is described as an ensemble of random DTs that aggregates votes or averages probabilities, a form of 'bagging'. XGBoost is presented as a scalable gradient\u2011boosting system that starts with a single tree and iteratively adds trees based on residuals. K\u2011means clustering is introduced as an unsupervised method that partitions observations into k clusters by minimizing within\u2011cluster variance, with Lloyd\u2019s algorithm as the most common heuristic. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is described as a statistical technique that transforms correlated variables into orthogonal, uncorrelated components via eigen\u2011decomposition or singular\u2011value decomposition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are noted for their position\u2011invariant feature extraction in computer vision, using convolutional layers that slide over images and compute dot products. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are explained as feed\u2011forward networks with feedback loops that allow them to model sequences, though they suffer from 'vanishing gradients'. Long Short\u2011Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced as a variant that mitigates this problem with gating mechanisms. Transformers are highlighted as architectures that rely solely on attention mechanisms, enabling them to process long\u2011range dependencies without recurrence or convolution. Finally, Q\u2011learning is described as a model\u2011free, value\u2011based reinforcement\u2011learning algorithm that seeks the optimal action sequence, often combined with neural networks for tasks such as video\u2011game playing or robotics. The article concludes by noting that these algorithms form the foundation of many modern AI applications.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 05:40 AM\nSource:[CIO](https://www.cio.de/article/4061494/14-ki-algorithmen-die-sie-kennen-sollten-2.html)\n\n**ZeroToGPT: A comprehensive guide to train Custom GPT from scratch on 7B tokens for free.**\nThe article presents a step\u2011by\u2011step guide to building a custom GPT\u2011style language model from scratch, using a 12\u2011layer decoder with 8 attention heads and training it on a 0.5\u202fB\u2011token dataset from Hugging\u202fFace.

The training pipeline is described: tokenization with an OpenAI tokenizer, memory\u2011mapped NumPy arrays for efficient batch loading, GPU\u2011accelerated data transfer with pinning and asynchronous copy, and mixed\u2011precision training with gradient scaling and clipping. Hyper\u2011parameters such as batch size, learning rate schedule (warmup + cosine decay), gradient accumulation, and optimizer (AdamW) are outlined. The model\u2019s architecture is instantiated, moved to GPU if available, and the total number of trainable parameters is reported. The training loop is detailed, including loss computation, evaluation frequency, and text\u2011generation sampling after each epoch. The guide concludes with practical tips for device selection, seed setting, and parameter counting.

With a learning rate of 0.0001 over 100 epochs, the network achieved an overall accuracy of 99.53\u202f%, a weighted F1 of 0.9953 and a mis\u2011classification rate of 0.47\u202f%. The confusion matrix shows class\u2011wise accuracies of 99.5\u202f% for Agricultural Crops (AC), 99.375\u202f% for Forest (F) and 99.667\u202f% for Highway (HV), with only a handful of mis\u2011classifications. Varying the learning rate demonstrated that lower rates improve performance, reaching 99.50\u202f% accuracy at 0.0001. Training required 700 iterations and 10 epochs; the average inference time per run was 678.91\u202fs (range 600\u2013750\u202fs). The model contains 4.3\u202fM parameters, 49 layers and 2.9\u202fMB, making it the lightest among compared architectures (e.g., VGG\u201119 144\u202fM params).

It highlights that the Transformer \"completely abandons recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in favor of the self\u2011attention mechanism\" to build sequence representations. The article describes how, given input vectors Q, K, and V, self\u2011attention calculates the relevance between different positions in the input sequence and then performs a weighted sum. It notes that the Transformer\u2019s emergence has reshaped deep\u2011learning research and applications, underpinning models such as 'BERT', 'GPT', and 'Vision Transformer (ViT)'.

It begins by noting that earlier models such as RNNs and LSTMs processed text sequentially, which limited their ability to capture long\u2011range dependencies. In 2017, the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' introduced the Transformer, which uses scaled dot\u2011product attention to directly relate every token in a sequence, enabling parallel processing and greater accuracy. The piece then walks through the core components of a Transformer: token embeddings, positional encodings, multi\u2011head self\u2011attention, feed\u2011forward layers, residual connections, and layer normalisation. A step\u2011by\u2011step example shows how to build a miniature encoder, train it on a toy counting task, and observe that the model learns to predict the next number in a sequence. The article emphasises that full\u2011scale Transformers require massive data and compute, so developers typically rely on pre\u2011trained models from Hugging Face. It lists common downstream tasks\u2014sentiment analysis, summarisation, translation\u2014and highlights the speed, efficiency and versatility of newer generations of models. Throughout, the author uses quotes such as 'If you've ever used Google Translate' and references the 2017 paper to illustrate key points. The tone is explanatory, aiming to demystify the architecture and practical use of Transformers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 04:39 PM\nSource:[freeCodeCamp.org News](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-transformer-models-for-language-processing/)\n\n**Attention is all you need\u200a -- \u200asimply explained**\nThe article explains the landmark 2017 paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Ashish Vaswani and co\u2011authors, which introduced the Transformer architecture that has since become the foundation of state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art models in natural language processing. It outlines how sequence\u2011to\u2011sequence tasks were traditionally handled by RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, and how the new attention mechanism, introduced in 2015, allowed models to focus on different parts of an input sequence. The Transformer eliminates the step\u2011by\u2011step processing of RNNs, enabling full\u2011sequence parallel computation. The summary details the encoder\u2011decoder structure: input embeddings, positional encoding (using sinusoidal functions), self\u2011attention with query, key, and value vectors, multi\u2011head attention, residual connections, layer normalization, and a feed\u2011forward network. It also describes the decoder\u2019s training and inference modes. The paper\u2019s results are highlighted, noting superior translation performance on English\u2011to\u2011German and English\u2011to\u2011French tasks and strong generalization to other linguistic tasks.

It begins with the 1950s\u20111980s era of expert systems that used manually written IF\u2011THEN rules, citing the 1970s medical system MYCIN as a landmark example. It then describes the 1980s\u20112000s machine\u2011learning era, where algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, SVMs, and k\u2011NN learned patterns directly from data, enabling applications in banking, e\u2011commerce, and spam filtering. The next phase, shallow neural networks, introduced simple ANN architectures with one hidden layer, which could model non\u2011linear relationships but were limited by computing power and data availability. The article explains how the 2010s saw a resurgence of deep learning, with multi\u2011layer CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and GANs achieving breakthroughs in computer vision, speech, and generative tasks, thanks to abundant data and GPU acceleration. Finally, it highlights the 2017 paper *'Attention Is All You Need'* by Vaswani et\u202fal., which introduced the transformer architecture. Transformers use self\u2011attention to process entire sequences in parallel, outperforming RNNs in speed and long\u2011range context handling. The article lists key transformer models\u2014BERT (2018), GPT series (2018\u2011present), T5, XLNet, LLaMA, PaLM\u2014and notes their widespread impact on chatbots, image generators, translation, and coding assistants.

Its key contributions are: (1) a fully attention\u2011based architecture that eliminates the need for RNNs or CNNs; (2) parallelization of token processing, which significantly reduces training time; and (3) the ability to capture long\u2011range dependencies through attention. These features enabled the development of large\u2011scale models such as BERT, GPT, T5, and RoBERTa, which now dominate natural language processing. The architecture is also applied in computer vision (Vision Transformers), generative AI, scientific research, and speech processing. Practical deployment is facilitated by libraries such as Hugging Face, which provide pre\u2011trained models (e.g., 'bert\u2011base\u2011uncased') that can be loaded with a few lines of code. For custom tasks, PyTorch offers a transformer layer that can be fine\u2011tuned or trained from scratch.

They were first introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' and have since become the foundation for nearly every state-of-the-art natural language processing model. The Transformer architecture addresses the limitations of older architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) by processing the entire sequence simultaneously through its attention mechanism. This allows every token to directly access information from every other token in the sequence, regardless of distance. The Transformer's design has two major benefits: it can model relationships over any distance in the sequence and it can capture complex dependencies and hierarchical structures in language. The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, with each layer containing an attention mechanism and a feed-forward block. The attention mechanism determines how much focus each token should give to every other token when forming its representation, while the feed-forward block provides non-linear transformation capacity. The Transformer's ability to process all tokens in parallel, combined with its flexibility and accuracy, explains why it has become the standard for almost all modern NLP systems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 12, 2025 08:41 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@vijaiyananda/transformers-unpacked-a-laymans-guide-to-how-they-work-580e1c65ef2b)\n\n**Decoding Transformers Model**\nThe Transformers model has significantly impacted the field of deep learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and sequence modeling.

This innovation, introduced in the 2017 paper 'Attention is All You Need' by Vaswani et al., enables Transformers to process thousands of words together, unlike older architectures like RNNs and LSTMs, which handle data sequentially. This shift from time-dependent to simultaneous computation is the foundation of Transformer scalability, making them capable of tackling tasks unimaginable with sequential models. As a result, Transformers have extended beyond language, and can scale wherever sequences exist.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a clear consensus that transformer-derived architectures will almost certainly remain state of the art (SOTA) for language modeling in December 2025. All experts cite the entrenched dominance of transformers in both research and industry, noting that nearly all leading models (GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, etc.) are transformer-based or hybrids that cite Vaswani et al. (2017). While alternatives such as State Space Models (SSMs, e.g., Mamba) and hybrid models (incorporating MoE or linear/SSM attention) are gaining traction in research, they remain either immature, not yet superior in benchmarks, or are themselves hybridized with transformers\u2014thus still counting as 'transformer-derived' under the resolution criteria, which are relatively inclusive. Multiple experts note the slow pace of paradigm shifts within NLP, with ecosystem inertia (investment, tooling, training, benchmarks, familiarity) strongly favoring continued dominance absent a sudden, widely recognized breakthrough. The consensus scenario for a 'No' outcome (displacement by a non-transformer architecture in SOTA leaderboards and scholarly consensus within the short timeframe to December 2025) is considered exceedingly unlikely. The scenario for a 'Yes' outcome\u2014transformer-derived or hybrid models remaining SOTA in benchmarks and top papers\u2014is strongly favored by recent literature and the structure of the resolution criteria.
