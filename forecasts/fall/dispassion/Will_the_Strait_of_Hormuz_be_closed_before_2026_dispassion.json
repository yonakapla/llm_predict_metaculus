Yet, recent Iranian behavior points to risk aversion: the shadow fleet's temporary transparency, and the avoidance of direct confrontation even after Israeli/US strikes, suggest a preference to avoid catastrophic escalation. The threshold for question resolution is low (only one day of <10 tankers), so a brief closure due to a clash or credible threat is not out of the question, but would still require Iran to cross a red line it has historically avoided due to the certainty of military response and economic blowback. Western naval strength and Chinese pressure further tilt the odds toward the status quo.

The precedent of Red Sea/Suez disruption by Ansar Allah shows that regional actors can severely affect chokepoints, but Iran's situation is more complex due to its own reliance on Strait traffic and the overwhelming deterrent posed by US naval power. While the probability of full closure remains low, it is higher than in previous years due to the acute regional crisis, credible Iranian preparations, and heightened risk of miscalculation.

Their emphasis on the differences between Hormuz and the Red Sea/Suez\u2014specifically the far greater military and economic stakes, and the stronger international response posture\u2014is well taken.

The Realism analysis also somewhat underplays the risk of accidental or short-term closure arising from miscalculation or a tit-for-tat escalation, which could meet the criteria even if not intended as a sustained blockade. Additionally, the Red Sea precedent shows that non-state and state actors can produce rapid, high-impact disruptions despite overwhelming deterrent postures.

Moreover, the forecast\u2019s probability (15%) may overstate the likelihood of accidental or unintended closure, given the high coordination and signaling density in the Gulf\u2019s maritime domain and the clear, recent pattern of Iranian risk aversion when faced with existential threats.

The explicit acknowledgment that only extreme, low-probability escalatory scenarios\u2014such as total war or regime collapse\u2014would likely tip the balance toward even a brief closure is well-founded. The probability (7%) is justified by the combination of a near-zero historical base rate, the strict resolution criteria, and the observable pattern of Iranian brinkmanship stopping short of genuine strategic self-sabotage.

The forecast rightly notes the low bar set by the resolution criteria, but it underestimates the powerful constraining effect of China's leverage and Iran's own need for uninterrupted oil revenue, as shown by the recent record export flows and shadow fleet behavior.

There is little new evidence of imminent escalation since my initial forecast, and the argument for a marginally lower probability is persuasive given the absence of concrete signs of immediate closure, ongoing high tanker traffic, and continued Iranian economic adaptation. Therefore, I am revising my probability downward slightly, to better align with the expert consensus and the most recent operational realities.",

If shipping got cut off, it could have significant impact on the world's oil volumes and put sharp upward pressure on world energy prices.

In addition, Iranian naval forces also operate several frigates, corvettes, and submarines, which are also tasked to complement blockade efforts. Further compounding maritime risk is the presence of Iran\u2019s two drone carriers\u2014Shahed Bagheri and Shahed Madabi. These converted commercial vessels are capable of launching large drones, missiles, and helicopters, and thus also represent a significant strike capability for Iran at sea. Although the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain, which, along with allied naval assets, is positioned to respond against such blockade measures, any direct military engagement risks further escalating the conflict into a regional war.\n\nFor more information see also from The War Zone defense news: [Could Iran Carry Out Its Threat To Shut Down The Strait Of Hormuz?](https://www.twz.com/news-features/could-iran-carry-out-its-threat-to-shut-the-strait-of-hormuz)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38769,\"question_id\":38066}}`",

This rare display of transparency\u2014lasting only three days\u2014contradicted Iran\u2019s long-standing strategy of evading U.S. sanctions by hiding ship movements. The sudden activation, which coincided with the reactivation of UN sanctions under the 'snapback mechanism' and increased maritime enforcement by Malaysia, sparked speculation about its purpose. Analysts proposed three possible explanations: a defensive move to avoid legal justification for vessel seizures by demonstrating compliance with international maritime rules; a response to growing Chinese pressure requiring transparency for insurance and port access, as China accounts for over 80% of Iran\u2019s oil exports; and an economic calculation to reduce logistical costs and increase revenue by avoiding the high expenses of the shadow fleet, including $100,000 daily VLCC rental fees, smuggling commissions, and losses from extended transit times. Despite the brief visibility, the fleet reverted to complete digital silence by October 17, 2025, leaving behind unresolved questions. Data from Kpler and TankerTrackers indicate Iran\u2019s oil exports reached 1.95 million barrels per day in September 2025\u2014its highest level since 2017\u2014while production rose to 3.45 million barrels per day, surpassing Libya and Nigeria combined. Most Iranian oil is rerouted via intermediate tankers and processed in China\u2019s independent 'small boiler refineries' to obscure its origin.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 01:33 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A1-%D8%AB%D9%85-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%8A)\n\n**European Organization: Echoes of Sana'a's Red Sea Attacks Resonate Beyond Yemen's Borders**\nThe Belgian organization 'Cris Group' reported that Yemeni attacks on Israeli or Israel-linked shipping in the Red Sea have had global repercussions, despite the ongoing war in Yemen remaining unresolved. The conflict escalated after Hamas launched attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting Yemeni forces to target Red Sea shipping to pressure for an end to the Gaza war and deliver aid. These attacks disrupted global trade, drawing in the United States, which conducted military operations in Yemen from April to May 2024 before a ceasefire agreement was reached. While Red Sea tensions dominated headlines, the conflict worsened internal dynamics in Yemen, undermining peace efforts between Yemen and Saudi Arabia/anti-Houthi forces, and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The European Union faces significant stakes, as disruptions to oil and cargo shipments through the strategic Bab-el-Mandeb Strait have severely impacted EU member states, with Greece suffering the highest number of incidents in the past two years. Most targeted vessels were linked to EU countries. Yemeni attacks evolved from ballistic missiles to advanced drones, including a July 2024 drone strike on central Tel Aviv that killed the first Israeli civilian. The organization emphasized that the impact of attacks from Sana'a extended beyond Yemen\u2019s borders, affecting Europe, which relies heavily on the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait for oil and commercial shipping. It urged the EU to intensify diplomatic efforts and invest in long-term maritime security infrastructure to ensure regional stability. The organization stressed that lasting stability requires resolving the Yemeni war in all its regional dimensions\u2014a point acknowledged by the EU in its May 2025 Council conclusions. A potential starting point is the Saudi-Yemeni roadmap, established before the Red Sea crisis, which includes a nationwide ceasefire, payment of civil servant salaries, resumption of oil exports, and laying the groundwork for UN-led Yemeni-Yemeni talks involving excluded factions. The EU is encouraged to advance these initiatives while quietly engaging Washington on using potential sanctions relief as an incentive for progress, without undermining political settlement prospects. Additionally, Brussels should promote reconciliation between communities aligned with Ansar Allah and those with Saudi Arabia, including by supporting local-level cooperation such as the Marib power project, which supplies electricity to both government-held and Houthi-controlled areas. Involving community leaders from both sides to revive such services could benefit all parties.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 02:10 AM\nSource:[\u0633\u0628\u062a\u0645\u0628\u0631 \u0646\u062a](https://26sep.net/index.php/local/115075-2025-10-22-05-10-09)\n\n**Where is the Strait of Hormuz? Which city and country does it belong to?**\nThe Strait of Hormuz is a strategically vital waterway located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, serving as the heart of global energy trade. Approximately 50 kilometers wide, it spans the narrowest point of the Arabian Peninsula, lying between the coastal regions of Iran and Oman. Geographically, it is a critical junction for maritime routes in western Asia. The strait has historically symbolized both trade and geopolitical power struggles, and today it remains one of the world\u2019s most critical sea lanes, with millions of barrels of oil and natural gas tankers passing through daily. Known as the 'Gateway to the World's Energy,' the strait has been a focal point of control conflicts among seafaring nations throughout history. It is not confined to a single city but is bordered by key settlements: Bandar Abbas on the Iranian side, Iran\u2019s largest port city and a major industrial and maritime trade hub, and Khasab on the Omani side, located on the Musandam Peninsula in northern Oman, known for its tranquil landscape.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 12:27 PM\nSource:[HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/hurmuz-bogazi-nerede-hurmuz-bogazi-hangi-sehirde-ulkede-htnrd-3831638)\n\n**EU Approves Measures to Address Russian 'Ghost Fleet' Vessels Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar**\nThe European Union has approved measures to address the Russian 'ghost fleet' vessels transiting through the Strait of Gibraltar, a critical maritime route. According to europasur.es, over half of Russia\u2019s maritime oil exports in the first six months of 2024 passed through the strait, using aging tankers with an average age of 17 years. These vessels often operate without international insurance and violate environmental and safety regulations, posing significant risks of oil spills and marine pollution\u2014similar to the Prestige disaster in 2002. The Spanish Navy is actively monitoring Russian naval units passing through the strait, and EU foreign ministers have appointed a coordinator between member states and the European External Action Service (EEAS) to enhance response effectiveness. EU High Representative Kaja Kallas emphasized the need for strategic agility, stating, 'This will be truly effective, because the Russians are very creative in this regard, and we must also be so to address all these problems. Thus, we will be more effective and faster.' The EU has warned that an incident involving the ghost fleet could trigger catastrophic oil spills and water contamination, severely impacting the blue economy and coastal communities. Additionally, a Russian oil tanker fared in Algeciras Bay due to technical issues, underscoring the operational risks. The Strait of Gibraltar remains a focal point in the broader network of maritime routes from the Black Sea through the Suez Canal to the Gulf of Aden and Turkey.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[europasur.es](https://www.europasur.es/campo-de-gibraltar/ue-abordaje-buques-flota-fantasma-rusia-estrecho_0_2005050492.html)\n\n**Yemen\u2019s Ansar Allah Causes Near-Total Shutdown at Eilat Port**\nThe port of Eilat in the occupied territories is experiencing near-total paralysis due to ongoing threats by Yemen's Ansar Allah (Houthis) against ships transiting the Red Sea toward the Suez Canal, according to reports from the economic website 'Calcalist'. This situation has triggered a severe economic and maritime crisis, prompting Eilat officials to call on both the United States and Egypt to intervene. Officials recently contacted the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv, urging that freedom of navigation in the Red Sea be included in agreements previously signed under former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The port administration also appealed to Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal, to pressure Sana\u2019a to lift the imposed blockade on the canal. The crisis has led to a sharp decline in Eilat\u2019s commercial activity, with ship traffic to the port suspended since November 2023, resulting in an 80% drop in port revenues. This threatens the continuation of operations and the payment of workers\u2019 wages, despite limited financial support from the Israeli government. Although Sana\u2019a has publicly committed to refraining from attacking Israel following an agreement with Hamas, it continues to target commercial vessels passing through the Red Sea, disrupting regional maritime traffic. As a result, the Suez Canal has remained nearly closed to Western ships since early 2024, with many European and American companies avoiding passage. Economic sources report that Suez Canal revenues plummeted from $10.25 billion in 2023 to approximately $3.99 billion in 2024\u2014a loss of about 60%, posing a major threat to Egypt\u2019s budget, which heavily relies on canal income. Eilat officials argue that there is a shared interest between Tel Aviv and Cairo in restoring normal maritime traffic to the Suez Canal. The Israeli government has provided support, allocating 15 million shekels to cover the port\u2019s debts and municipal taxes, and allowing access to emergency aid funds to prevent total closure.

This rare display of transparency\u2014lasting only three days\u2014contradicted Iran\u2019s long-standing strategy of evading U.S. sanctions by hiding ship movements. The sudden activation, which coincided with the reactivation of UN sanctions under the 'snapback mechanism' and increased maritime enforcement by Malaysia, sparked speculation about its purpose. Analysts proposed three possible explanations: a defensive move to avoid legal justification for vessel seizures by demonstrating compliance with international maritime rules; a response to growing Chinese pressure requiring transparency for insurance and port access, as China accounts for over 80% of Iran\u2019s oil exports; and an economic calculation to reduce logistical costs and increase revenue by avoiding the high expenses of the shadow fleet, including $100,000 daily VLCC rental fees, smuggling commissions, and losses from extended transit times. Despite the brief visibility, the fleet reverted to complete digital silence by October 17, 2025, leaving behind unresolved questions. Data from Kpler and TankerTrackers indicate Iran\u2019s oil exports reached 1.95 million barrels per day in September 2025\u2014its highest level since 2017\u2014while production rose to 3.45 million barrels per day, surpassing Libya and Nigeria combined. Most Iranian oil is rerouted via intermediate tankers and processed in China\u2019s independent 'small boiler refineries' to obscure its origin.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 01:33 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A1-%D8%AB%D9%85-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%8A)\n\n**Minister of Roads: Connecting the Rasht-Astara Corridor Remains a Top Priority Despite Sanctions**\nIran's Minister of Roads and Urban Development, Farzaneh Sadegh, stated that connecting the northern-southern corridor (Rasht-Astara) remains a top priority for the government despite international sanctions. During a trilateral meeting among Iran, Azerbaijan, and Russia in Baku, she announced that 15 million tons of cargo have been secured for transport via the corridor, with a roadmap to be established within the next three months to ensure phased delivery. The project received high-level support, including attendance by Iran's President at a meeting with business leaders and trade associations, who expressed satisfaction over the project\u2019s national priority status. Sadegh emphasized the historic significance of the meeting, noting it was the first time representatives from Azerbaijan and Russia attended in person, including a joint field visit from Lenkaran to Astara (Azerbaijan), crossing into Astara (Iran), and a follow-up meeting at a rail-road station complex, concluding with a detailed press conference. She highlighted the project\u2019s regional and national impact, stressing that achievements were made despite global sanctions. The progress is attributed to strong diplomacy by the national unity government and direct presidential oversight. Sadegh also confirmed that transport diplomacy is now taking shape, with efforts underway to complete the 'Jahbar-Zahedan' railway line by the end of 2025. The project has been welcomed by Azerbaijan, Russia, and other countries due to its strategic importance in linking the port of Jahbar to internal transport networks, significantly enhancing connectivity. Additionally, she announced efforts to complete the two-decade-long Ardabil-Mianeh railway project and launch operations by the end of 2025.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 12:43 PM\nSource:[Mehr News Agency](https://ar.mehrnews.com/news/1964062/%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B7-%D9%85%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%A2%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%BA%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%86)\n\n**European Organization: Echoes of Sana'a's Red Sea Attacks Resonate Beyond Yemen's Borders**\nThe Belgian organization 'Cris Group' reported that Yemeni attacks on Israeli or Israel-linked shipping in the Red Sea have had global repercussions, despite the ongoing war in Yemen remaining unresolved. The conflict escalated after Hamas launched attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting Yemeni forces to target Red Sea shipping to pressure for an end to the Gaza war and deliver aid. These attacks disrupted global trade, drawing in the United States, which conducted military operations in Yemen from April to May 2024 before a ceasefire agreement was reached. While Red Sea tensions dominated headlines, the conflict worsened internal dynamics in Yemen, undermining peace efforts between Yemen and Saudi Arabia/anti-Houthi forces, and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The European Union faces significant stakes, as disruptions to oil and cargo shipments through the strategic Bab-el-Mandeb Strait have severely impacted EU member states, with Greece suffering the highest number of incidents in the past two years. Most targeted vessels were linked to EU countries. Yemeni attacks evolved from ballistic missiles to advanced drones, including a July 2024 drone strike on central Tel Aviv that killed the first Israeli civilian. The organization emphasized that the impact of attacks from Sana'a extended beyond Yemen\u2019s borders, affecting Europe, which relies heavily on the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait for oil and commercial shipping. It urged the EU to intensify diplomatic efforts and invest in long-term maritime security infrastructure to ensure regional stability. The organization stressed that lasting stability requires resolving the Yemeni war in all its regional dimensions\u2014a point acknowledged by the EU in its May 2025 Council conclusions. A potential starting point is the Saudi-Yemeni roadmap, established before the Red Sea crisis, which includes a nationwide ceasefire, payment of civil servant salaries, resumption of oil exports, and laying the groundwork for UN-led Yemeni-Yemeni talks involving excluded factions. The EU is encouraged to advance these initiatives while quietly engaging Washington on using potential sanctions relief as an incentive for progress, without undermining political settlement prospects. Additionally, Brussels should promote reconciliation between communities aligned with Ansar Allah and those with Saudi Arabia, including by supporting local-level cooperation such as the Marib power project, which supplies electricity to both government-held and Houthi-controlled areas. Involving community leaders from both sides to revive such services could benefit all parties.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 02:10 AM\nSource:[\u0633\u0628\u062a\u0645\u0628\u0631 \u0646\u062a](https://26sep.net/index.php/local/115075-2025-10-22-05-10-09)\n\n**Crude tankers firing on all cylinders as oil in transit soars**\nCrude oil in transit reached 1.31 million barrels per day in the week of October 13, 2025\u2014the highest level since May 4, 2020\u2014according to Vortexa data, raising concerns about a potential oil supply glut. This surge is not primarily due to strong exports from the Middle East Gulf and the Americas, but rather driven by geopolitical factors: increased effectiveness of sanctions and disruptions from new Chinese port fees. These inefficiencies are inflating tanker utilization across all segments. Vortexa data shows that while total crude in transit is high, the surge is concentrated in sanctioned crude, particularly from Russia, which China and India are increasingly unwilling or unable to import. This has led to prolonged vessel stays at sea, contributing to floating storage. VLCC utilization has hit its highest level since the pandemic-era boom, while suezmax and aframax segments also show strong gains, with the aframax index reaching its highest point since April 17, 2025, at $49,720 per day\u2014double its mid-June level. Analysts project divergent futures: Clarksons Securities' Frode M\u00f8rkedal suggests VLCC rates could reach $63,000/day under moderate OPEC cuts, or exceed $200,000/day if prices collapse and 10% of the global fleet enters floating storage. However, the IEA\u2019s Toril Bosoni warns of an 'untenable' 4 million bpd supply surplus by 2026, expecting supply-side responses like OPEC reversals or reduced US shale output. The Baltic Exchange\u2019s VLCC time-charter equivalent index fluctuated between $56,986 and $88,082 per day in October 2025, closing at $82,608 per day on Tuesday. The suezmax index stood at $70,424 per day, down from a recent high of $72,981, while the aframax index remained resilient. Vortexa\u2019s David Wech emphasized that the current surplus is largely confined to sanctioned crude, which is not reflected in benchmark prices like WTI and Brent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 11:12 PM\nSource:[Lloyd s List](https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1155177/Crude-tankers-firing-on-all-cylinders-as-oil-in-transit-soars)\n\n**Ministry of Development and Ministry of Foreign Affairs Condemn Opening of Cargo Crossing in Occupied Berdiansk and Warn of Risks**\nThe Ministry of Development of Communities and Territories and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine strongly condemned the opening of a so-called maritime cargo crossing point in the temporarily occupied port city of Berdiansk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast. In a joint statement published on Facebook, the ministries stated that this move is a further attempt by Russia to legitimize its illegal occupation of Ukrainian territory and consolidate control through the creation of pseudo-legal mechanisms. The action stems directly from a Russian government decree dated August 22, 2024, which included the ports of Berdiansk and Mariupol in the list of Russian maritime ports open to foreign vessels. The Ukrainian ministries emphasized that these actions violate fundamental principles of international law, including the UN Charter (which upholds state sovereignty and prohibits interference in internal affairs), the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (which affirms Ukraine\u2019s exclusive authority over navigation in its territorial waters), and UN General Assembly resolutions affirming Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty over all its territories within internationally recognized borders and condemning Russian aggression. The statement warned that the opening of the so-called 'crossing point' is an attempt to legitimize illegal trade operations from occupied areas, including the theft and export of Ukrainian resources such as grain, coal, and metal. It further cautioned that foreign companies involved could be complicit in violations of international and national sanctions laws. Ukraine called on the international community to intensify sanctions pressure on Russia, particularly targeting individuals and legal entities operating in the ports of Berdiansk and Mariupol, as well as vessels entering these ports. The ministries also urged the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to act immediately in accordance with resolution A.1183(33) of December 4, 2023, which calls on member states to refrain from any activity in closed maritime ports on temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories, and to take measures against vessels violating the closure regime. The statement concluded that any Russian attempts to 'open' Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov are futile, have no legal effect, and represent another step in efforts to legitimize armed aggression and annexation. Ukraine pledged to continue working with international partners to ensure a strong response, including imposing sanctions on Russian ports supporting the war machine.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 07:18 PM\nSource:[\u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/4049958-minrozvitku-ta-mzs-zasudili-vidkritta-vantaznogo-punktu-propusku-u-berdansku-i-poperedili-pro-riziki.html)\n\n**Where is the Strait of Hormuz? Which city and country does it belong to?**\nThe Strait of Hormuz is a strategically vital waterway located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, serving as the heart of global energy trade. Approximately 50 kilometers wide, it spans the narrowest point of the Arabian Peninsula, lying between the coastal regions of Iran and Oman. Geographically, it is a critical junction for maritime routes in western Asia. The strait has historically symbolized both trade and geopolitical power struggles, and today it remains one of the world\u2019s most critical sea lanes, with millions of barrels of oil and natural gas tankers passing through daily. Known as the 'Gateway to the World's Energy,' the strait has been a focal point of control conflicts among seafaring nations throughout history. It is not confined to a single city but is bordered by key settlements: Bandar Abbas on the Iranian side, Iran\u2019s largest port city and a major industrial and maritime trade hub, and Khasab on the Omani side, located on the Musandam Peninsula in northern Oman, known for its tranquil landscape.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 12:27 PM\nSource:[HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/hurmuz-bogazi-nerede-hurmuz-bogazi-hangi-sehirde-ulkede-htnrd-3831638)\n\n**EU Approves Measures to Address Russian 'Ghost Fleet' Vessels Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar**\nThe European Union has approved measures to address the Russian 'ghost fleet' vessels transiting through the Strait of Gibraltar, a critical maritime route. According to europasur.es, over half of Russia\u2019s maritime oil exports in the first six months of 2024 passed through the strait, using aging tankers with an average age of 17 years. These vessels often operate without international insurance and violate environmental and safety regulations, posing significant risks of oil spills and marine pollution\u2014similar to the Prestige disaster in 2002. The Spanish Navy is actively monitoring Russian naval units passing through the strait, and EU foreign ministers have appointed a coordinator between member states and the European External Action Service (EEAS) to enhance response effectiveness. EU High Representative Kaja Kallas emphasized the need for strategic agility, stating, 'This will be truly effective, because the Russians are very creative in this regard, and we must also be so to address all these problems. Thus, we will be more effective and faster.' The EU has warned that an incident involving the ghost fleet could trigger catastrophic oil spills and water contamination, severely impacting the blue economy and coastal communities. Additionally, a Russian oil tanker fared in Algeciras Bay due to technical issues, underscoring the operational risks. The Strait of Gibraltar remains a focal point in the broader network of maritime routes from the Black Sea through the Suez Canal to the Gulf of Aden and Turkey.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[europasur.es](https://www.europasur.es/campo-de-gibraltar/ue-abordaje-buques-flota-fantasma-rusia-estrecho_0_2005050492.html)\n\n**Yemen\u2019s Ansar Allah Causes Near-Total Shutdown at Eilat Port**\nThe port of Eilat in the occupied territories is experiencing near-total paralysis due to ongoing threats by Yemen's Ansar Allah (Houthis) against ships transiting the Red Sea toward the Suez Canal, according to reports from the economic website 'Calcalist'. This situation has triggered a severe economic and maritime crisis, prompting Eilat officials to call on both the United States and Egypt to intervene. Officials recently contacted the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv, urging that freedom of navigation in the Red Sea be included in agreements previously signed under former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The port administration also appealed to Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal, to pressure Sana\u2019a to lift the imposed blockade on the canal. The crisis has led to a sharp decline in Eilat\u2019s commercial activity, with ship traffic to the port suspended since November 2023, resulting in an 80% drop in port revenues. This threatens the continuation of operations and the payment of workers\u2019 wages, despite limited financial support from the Israeli government. Although Sana\u2019a has publicly committed to refraining from attacking Israel following an agreement with Hamas, it continues to target commercial vessels passing through the Red Sea, disrupting regional maritime traffic. As a result, the Suez Canal has remained nearly closed to Western ships since early 2024, with many European and American companies avoiding passage. Economic sources report that Suez Canal revenues plummeted from $10.25 billion in 2023 to approximately $3.99 billion in 2024\u2014a loss of about 60%, posing a major threat to Egypt\u2019s budget, which heavily relies on canal income. Eilat officials argue that there is a shared interest between Tel Aviv and Cairo in restoring normal maritime traffic to the Suez Canal. The Israeli government has provided support, allocating 15 million shekels to cover the port\u2019s debts and municipal taxes, and allowing access to emergency aid funds to prevent total closure. However, port workers maintain that current measures are temporary and insufficient, emphasizing that full commercial recovery and profitability can only be achieved if restrictions on the Suez Canal are lifted.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 09:16 PM\nSource:[palinfo.com](https://palinfo.com/news/2025/10/20/978971)\n\n**Motta Defends Raising Ethanol Blend in Gasoline to 35%**\nHugo Motta, President of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, advocated on October 20, 2025, during the 25th International Sugar and Ethanol Conference in S\u00e3o Paulo, for increasing the mandatory ethanol blend in gasoline from 30% to 35%. He stated that this measure would strengthen the country's biofuels industry. The proposal follows the June 2025 approval by the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE), which raised the mandatory ethanol blend in gasoline from 27% to 30%, effective August 1, 2025, and increased biodiesel in diesel from 14% to 15%. The government asserts these changes aim to reduce Brazil's dependence on oil and mitigate the impact of international price fluctuations, especially due to the Iran-Israel conflict affecting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. According to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the ethanol blend increase could lower gasoline prices at pumps by up to R$0.11 per liter, as ethanol is cheaper than fossil fuel when taxation is considered.

The article cites social media posts from Israeli soldiers celebrating destruction and draws historical parallels to the 1948 Nakba, where widespread looting of Palestinian property occurred. It claims Israel reduced aid flows into Gaza and kept the Rafah border closed, citing Hamas's delayed handover of hostages as justification. The dispatch criticizes U.S. and Israeli narratives of the conflict, accusing them of equating the war in Gaza with a balanced conflict, while portraying Israel as the victim. It further condemns U.S. and Israeli actions, including a June bombing campaign on Iran that killed over 1,000 people, and dismisses Trump\u2019s call for peace with Iran as hypocritical. The article highlights the strategic impact of Houthi and Yemeni military actions in the Red Sea, arguing they have disrupted Israeli maritime dominance and forced economic and political recalibration across the region. It also reports on a series of devastating Russian drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, including oil depots and electrical substations, with experts interpreting these as prelude to a larger military offensive. The dispatch concludes with a condemnation of U.S. drone strikes on small boats off Venezuela\u2019s coast as extrajudicial executions, citing lack of evidence.

The decline is partly due to temporary shocks such as Houthi attacks off Yemen and Iran\u2011Israel tensions, but the article also notes a longer\u2011term structural shift as traders reroute through the Cape of Good Hope and alternative pipelines.  It cites that about three\u2011quarters of global oil demand moves through chokepoints, with roughly one\u2011fifth via the Strait of Hormuz and one\u2011quarter via the Strait of Malacca.  The Strait of Malacca currently moves about 24\u202fmillion bpd of oil and gas, with China importing 50\u202f% of the volume and Saudi Arabia exporting 25\u202f%.  The Strait of Hormuz carries about 14\u202fmillion bpd of oil and condensate, representing half of Saudi and UAE exports and a quarter of China\u2019s demand; it also transits about 20\u202f% of global LNG, with Qatar exporting 16.3\u202fBcfd through it.  The Bab\u202fel\u2011Mandeb, which once handled 12\u202f% of seaborne oil trade, saw daily volumes drop by nearly 50\u202f% after December\u202f2023 Houthi attacks, and a full closure would force vessels to detour around the Cape of Good Hope, increasing voyage times and freight costs.  The Turkish Straits account for roughly 5\u202f% of global maritime oil trade, with 3.5\u202fmillion bpd of crude and 0.5\u202fBcfd of LNG passing through in 2023; Russian oil makes up about 40\u202f% of that traffic.  The Cape of Good Hope now handles 8\u201310\u202f% of worldwide shipping, with oil traffic rising from 6\u202fmillion bpd in 2023 to 8.7\u202fmillion bpd in 2024 due to Red Sea disruptions.  The article quotes Mrinal Bhardwaj, Senior Analyst, Upstream Research, Rystad Energy, saying, 'Any disruption at these chokepoints could shatter supply chains, trigger sharp spikes in energy prices and inflict severe economic damage worldwide.'

In 2023, roughly 71.3\u202fmillion barrels per day (bpj) of oil and petroleum products and 26\u202fbillion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) passed through these narrow passages, a figure that fell to 65\u202fmillion bpj of oil and 24.8\u202fBcfd of LNG in 2024, signalling growing instability. The report cites disruptions such as Houthi attacks off Yemen and tensions between Iran and Israel as short\u2011term causes, while noting a longer\u2011term structural shift as traders and governments reroute flows via the Cape of Good Hope and other pipelines. Rystad identified the Strait of Hormuz, the Strait of Malacca, the Suez Canal, the Bab\u202fEl\u202fMandeb and the Turkish Straits as the most at\u2011risk points, estimating that about 75\u202f% of global oil demand depends on these routes, with 25\u202f% transiting the Malacca and 20\u202f% the Hormuz. The analysis warns that a full closure of any of these chokepoints would trigger unprecedented price volatility and supply shocks. \"The strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz was highlighted during the recent Iran\u2011Israel conflict, when the Iranian parliament proposed a bill to close it,\" said Mrinal Bhardwaj, senior upstream analyst at Rystad. \"If the strait were shut, it could disrupt nearly half of Middle\u2011Eastern oil exports, severely impacting global transport of oil and gas.\" The report also notes that insurance premiums and freight rates have risen sharply, reflecting market anticipation of continued maritime instability.

In 2023, about 71.3\u202fmillion barrels per day (bpj) of oil and 26\u202fbillion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) of LNG moved through these chokepoints; the volume fell to 65\u202fmillion bpj of oil and 24.8\u202fBcfd of LNG in 2024, signalling growing instability. The decline is partly due to temporary disruptions such as Houthi attacks off Yemen and Iran\u2011Israel tensions, but also reflects a long\u2011term structural shift as traders and governments reroute flows via the Cape of Good Hope and other pipelines. China is highly vulnerable because of its dependence on the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of Malacca, whereas the United States is less exposed thanks to higher domestic production. Rystad\u2019s chief analyst, Mrinal Bhardwaj, said, 'We have identified the five most at\u2011risk chokepoints, assessed the threats they face, and highlighted the profound consequences for global energy markets.' Any disruption could trigger supply chain shocks, sharp price spikes, and severe economic damage worldwide. The report notes that about three\u2011quarters of global oil demand relies on maritime chokepoints, with roughly a quarter passing through the Strait of Malacca and one\u2011fifth through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Malacca, carrying about 24\u202fmillion bpj, is the world\u2019s largest commercial choke point, dominated by Chinese imports (50\u202f% of volume). The Strait of Hormuz handles about 14\u202fmillion bpj of oil and condensates and nearly half of Middle\u2011Eastern production destined for Asian markets. The Suez Canal and Bab el\u2011Mandeb are also critical, with Houthi attacks in late 2023 cutting Bab el\u2011Mandeb volumes by nearly 50\u202f% in six months. The Cape of Good Hope, now a key alternative route, saw a 50\u202f% rise in 2024 to 8.7\u202fmillion bpj, driven by Houthi attacks that forced rerouting. Turkish straits, carrying about 5\u202f% of global oil trade, remain vital but face operational and geopolitical risks.

According to US officials, the Iranian military has loaded naval mines on ships in the Persian Gulf last month, increasing Washington's concerns about Tehran's readiness to close the Strait of Hormuz following Israeli strikes on Iranian sites. The move, which has not been previously reported, was discovered by US intelligence after Israel's initial missile strike on Iran on June 13. The loading of mines - which were not deployed in the strait - suggests that Iran may be serious about closing one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, a move that would spark an already escalating conflict and severely disrupt global trade. The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, with a width of about 21 miles at its narrowest point. It contains two shipping lanes, each one mile wide, one for incoming and the other for outgoing traffic. The strait is a critical chokepoint for global oil trade, with around 26% of the world's oil passing through it, making it one of the most important strategic waterways in the world. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz in 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 accounted for more than a quarter of global maritime oil trade and around a fifth of global oil consumption. Additionally, around a fifth of global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade passed through the strait in 2024, mostly from Qatar. Due to its strategic location, there is no effective alternative to the Strait of Hormuz. Therefore, any disruption to shipping through it would have severe consequences for global oil and LNG trade, leading to a sharp increase in prices. Any fluctuations in oil prices have a ripple effect on many goods and services, causing widespread economic impacts. The alternatives to the Strait of Hormuz, such as land-based pipelines, are limited in capacity compared to the volume of traffic through the strait. Saudi Aramco operates the East-West Pipeline, with a capacity of 5 million barrels per day, stretching from the processing center in Abqaiq near the Persian Gulf to the port of Yanbu on the Red Sea. The UAE operates a pipeline with a capacity of 1.8 million barrels per day, connecting the onshore fields to the port of Fujairah on the Gulf of Oman. Historical experience has shown that Iran has consistently claimed it can close the Strait of Hormuz. According to the report, despite the fact that the Strait of Hormuz cannot be 'closed' in the classical sense - like a land road - Iran can make it a hazardous area for maritime trade, effectively disrupting global shipping. During the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Iran targeted oil tankers and loading facilities with naval mines and cruise missiles, including Chinese Silkworm missiles, and used fast boats to harass ships. While these operations did not completely close the Strait, they caused a significant increase in maritime insurance costs and delays in shipping. According to a 2012 report by the US Congressional Research Service (CRS), Iran can attempt to impede the Strait on a gradual basis, starting with less violent measures, then escalating to more violent options, or may opt for a mix of violent and non-violent measures from the outset. The report lists potential Iranian options, including declaring the closure of the Strait to navigation without specifying the consequences for ships attempting to pass through, threatening ships explicitly to intercept them, detain them, attack them, or fire warning shots at ships passing through the Strait or the Gulf. The report also includes laying naval mines in the Strait and other parts of the Gulf, or using submarines, warships, and cruise missiles from the coast and aircraft to attack foreign naval vessels outside the Strait. All these options would cause significant disruption to global energy flows, making the Strait of Hormuz a hot spot for any potential escalation in the region.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 08:41 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/strait-of-hormuz)\n\n**Iran's Plan to Block the Strait of Hormuz: A Threat to Global Trade**\nAccording to a Reuters report, Iran was preparing to block the Strait of Hormuz in June 2025, which would have had severe consequences for global trade. The report states that Iran had loaded mines onto ships in the Persian Gulf and was ready to block the strait after an Israeli attack. US intelligence agencies detected Iran's intentions shortly after Israel's first rocket attack on June 13. The blockage of the strait, which carries around 20-25% of the world's oil consumption, would have led to a significant escalation of the conflict and severely disrupted global trade. 'It would have had catastrophic consequences for global trade and the economy,' said a US official. The Strait of Hormuz is a critical artery for global trade, particularly for the energy market. It is not just a shipping route, but a vital 'bottleneck' for global energy and economic security. Any significant disruption to shipping through the strait would have had devastating consequences for global trade and the economy. The strait is the only maritime route connecting the oil-rich Persian Gulf to the world ocean, carrying huge volumes of crude oil and liquefied natural gas from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Iran. Daily, around 20-21 million barrels of oil pass through the strait, accounting for approximately 20-25% of global oil consumption. Also, around 20% of the world's liquefied natural gas exports pass through the strait, with most of it coming from Qatar. Most of the energy resources passing through the strait are destined for Asian markets. In 2024, 84% of crude oil and 83% of liquefied natural gas passing through the strait were intended for Asian countries, including China, India, Japan, and South Korea. 'The blockage of the strait would have led to a sharp rise in global oil prices,' said a US official. Instead, global oil prices fell by more than 10% after US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, partly due to relief that the conflict did not cause significant disruptions to oil trade. US officials did not reveal how they detected the mines on Iranian ships, but such intelligence is usually gathered through satellite imagery, secret agents, or a combination of both methods.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 07:22 AM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/novosti-mir/iran-gotovilsya-zamenyat-ormuzskij-proliv-v-reuters-raskryili-podrobnosti-i-obyasnili-kakimi-byili-byi-posledstviya.htm)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a wide range of expert perspectives\u2014military, energy security, international relations, strategic studies, and area studies\u2014the consensus is that despite Iran's well-documented military capabilities and recent threats to close the Strait of Hormuz amid heightened Iran-Israel and Iran-US tensions, an actual closure as defined by fewer than 10 tanker ships transiting on any single day before the end of 2025 remains unlikely. The experts universally cite the historical base rate: in over 40 years of recurring crises, Iran has never fully closed the Strait to this degree, even during wars and peak standoffs. While Iran has increased its signaling, prepared mines, and retains short-term capabilities to disrupt traffic, the dominant incentives (economic self-preservation, especially oil export revenue reliant on the Strait, and pressure from China as a key buyer), as well as the certainty of massive US/allied military response, strongly deter actual closure.\n\nSome factors increase tail risk: precedents from Red Sea/Suez disruptions, concrete Iranian preparatory actions, and the resolution criteria's relatively low bar (a single day below 10 tankers) mean that a sharp sudden escalation could theoretically trigger a brief closure. This keeps the probability non-zero and slightly elevated compared to peacetime base rates. However, recent Iranian behavior (shadow fleet visibility, record oil exports), absence of mine deployment, market adaptation, and sustained US naval deterrence all suggest ongoing restraint and adaptation rather than imminent closure.\n\nScenarios for a 'yes' outcome (closure) typically require a black swan event\u2014such as a massive, regime-threatening strike on Iran by the US or Israel\u2014prompting Iran to mine or attack the Strait, with traffic halted for a day or two before international forces restore order. However, all experts see this as a low-probability, last-resort move, not a likely near-term scenario given the remaining short time window. Final probabilities from individual experts cluster between 7% and 22%, with most in the 7\u201315% range and only isolated cases above 20%. The overwhelming consensus is that incentives on all sides, historical patterns, and the high cost of closure favor continued tension but not a full closure by the end of 2025.",
