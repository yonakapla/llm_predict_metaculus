However, the US homeland remains a much harder target than Ukraine, the Sahel, or Mexican states: strong counterterrorism, robust intelligence sharing, and increasing awareness of drone threats by law enforcement and critical infrastructure operators raise the technical and operational bar for would-be attackers. The fact that, despite years of warnings and rapid global proliferation, no such attack has occurred in the US to date suggests a low base rate. While the accessibility of drones and the potential for lone-actor innovation prevent probabilities from dropping too low, the short time window (just over 2 months) further decreases the likelihood of a successful, injurious attack that meets the strict resolution criteria. There are also no known credible plots or near-misses in the US in 2025. Therefore, while the risk is real and rising for the coming years, the chance of a qualifying attack before January 1, 2026, remains low but non-negligible.",

The argument is further strengthened by explicit mention of the short forecast window, which is a key determinant in terrorist innovation cycles and operational timelines. This nuanced, status quo-driven probability estimate (7%) is well justified and aligns with the realities of both threat evolution and practical barriers to execution in the U.S. context."

From a Science and Technology Studies (Dual Use Technology) perspective, regulatory and technological countermeasures often lag behind the pace of innovation and adaptation among non-state actors, especially as demonstrated by the near-border attacks in Mexico that have outpaced state responses. Moreover, the attributional challenges cut both ways: a sufficiently dramatic or public attack will likely be labeled terrorism by authorities and media, especially given heightened alertness and politicization of the drone threat. Thus, while attribution hurdles are real, they may not be quite as prohibitive as suggested, particularly if an attack occurs in a context (e.g., a public event) that fits terrorism narratives. Furthermore, focusing on regulatory and detection barriers risks underweighting the ease of circumvention by motivated actors, as illustrated in other technology transfer cases. The probability could thus be justified as slightly higher, given these sociotechnical dynamics."

The original question opened on 2024-03-25 18:03:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/20953). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nWeaponized aerial drones, especially the FPV drones rose in popularity in 2022 as a [new type of weapon in the Russo-Ukrainian war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/02/drones-russia-ukraine-air-war/). The modern commercial FPV drones have an operational range of 2-3 km (more with the retranslator), and are easy to build and use for engaging moving and stationary targets. With the addition of AI-supported target tracking, their success rate can be further improved, turning them into a new type of weapon used for eliminating high-valued targets or in acts of terrorism across the globe.\n\nAs a potential weapon of terrorism, it has a number of advantages: \n\n* The drones themselves are considered civilian equipment and are much less regulated compared to firearms. In most countries they can be shipped across the borders without extra permissions.\n* Comparable price to a sniper rifle. The current price of a DJI Mavic 3 drone is [about $2000](https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Mavic-Hasselblad-Omnidirectional-Transmission/dp/B09HH8B79P?th=1). However, it usually needs additional work to be turned into a combat drone.\n* Using the drone does not require the operator to have a line-of-sight with the target. The operator can remain hidden throughout the process and leave the area unnoticed. \n* Compared to using an IED the drone does not require the operator to ever visit the target area.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":20953,\"question_id\":20953}}`",

The attack, captured on video by multiple Ukrainian surveillance drones, occurred during a critical phase of the conflict, with the drone flying from about 15 kilometers away and striking the helicopter\u2019s fuel tank, causing it to crash into flames. The footage, widely shared and celebrated, including by Ukrainian President Volod\u00edmir Zelenski, marked the first documented case of a fully destroyed enemy helicopter using such a small drone. The Ukrainian command, led by 31-year-old Maxim from the 59th Brigade\u2019s 'Predators of the Heights' battalion, confirmed that the helicopter likely carried three to four Russian soldiers, all of whom perished. The incident highlights a strategic shift in modern warfare, where inexpensive drones are increasingly effective against high-value military assets\u2014such as the Mi-8, valued at around \u20ac6 million\u2014compared to costly anti-air missiles, which can cost up to \u20ac1 million each. The success has boosted morale among Ukrainian troops, who view the event as a turning point. Despite this, the broader situation remains dire: Russian forces control roughly 70% of Donetsk Oblast, and combat in the region remains intense, with Ukrainian forces gradually liberating areas and surrounding Russian troops. Russian sources, via Telegram, acknowledge severe mobility restrictions and logistical challenges. The operation underscores the growing role of drones in the war, with Ukraine producing millions annually, and has fueled Zelenski\u2019s push to exchange drones for long-range Tomahawk missiles with the U.S.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 03:46 AM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-10-21/david-contra-goliat-un-dron-ucranio-de-700-euros-desintegra-un-helicoptero-ruso-de-seis-millones.html)\n\n**Small Suicide Drones Forced Russians to Surrender, Reshaping Ukraine\u2019s War Strategy**\nIn June 2024, Ukrainian forces used a small, bomb-laden unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to force Russian troops to surrender in Kharkiv, marking a pivotal moment in the war. The 138-pound explosive UGV, costing approximately $1,500 (NT$45,888), was deployed by Ukraine\u2019s 3rd Assault Brigade to destroy Russian defensive positions. After a series of coordinated attacks involving aerial drones for reconnaissance and suppression, the UGV entered a Russian trench complex and detonated, triggering a massive explosion. Following the blast, Russian soldiers emerged from their shelter\u2014handing in makeshift surrender signs, unarmed, and without body armor. A surveillance drone hovered above, guiding the surrendering soldiers to Ukrainian forces. This event, confirmed by The Washington Post through footage and interviews with brigade commanders, marked the first confirmed instance of Ukraine capturing enemy combatants using such a device. The success was attributed to precise coordination between drone operators and ground units. The use of low-cost, high-precision UGVs has transformed frontline operations, reducing Ukrainian casualties and enabling the retention of strategic positions despite being outnumbered. Ukrainian military leaders reported that the number of frontline missions conducted by UGVs nearly doubled between August and September 2024. These vehicles now perform a range of tasks, including supply delivery, evacuation, and direct assaults, with some equipped with remote-controlled machine guns. The war in Ukraine has become a real-world testing ground for future warfare, where unmanned systems are increasingly central to battlefield dynamics.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 12:52 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/122663/9083705)\n\n**Drones of Crime and the Urgent Need to Modernize Security Systems**\nAn explosive drone attack on the Baja California Attorney General's office in Tijuana, near the U.S. border, confirmed that organized crime now uses aerial methods to challenge state authority. The device, loaded with nails and metal fragments, damaged several vehicles and caused panic among staff but resulted in no fatalities or injuries. The attack, attributed by Baja California's Attorney General Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade to a powerful criminal group, is strongly linked to the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG), based on its history of similar drone attacks in Michoac\u00e1n, Guanajuato, and Zacatecas. The U.S. Consulate in Tijuana issued a security alert, underscoring the seriousness of the incident. Drones used in such attacks are low-cost, with basic hobbyist FPV models costing $100\u2013$300 and more advanced attack-ready systems priced between $600 and $2,000, often with an effective cost of around $800. The ease of acquisition and operation\u2014using internet-connected FPV technology\u2014has enabled criminal groups to rapidly adopt drones for surveillance, drug transport, and now, as weapons. In response, Mexico\u2019s federal government has deployed armed drones, signal-jamming equipment, AI-powered detection systems, and implemented mandatory civilian drone registration, alongside intelligence sharing with U.S. agencies. However, criminal innovation outpaces state defenses: attackers use high-performance FPV and fiber-optic drones\u2014similar to those seen in Ukraine\u2014operated by trained personnel, including former military and police, as well as skilled gamers and technicians. Evidence also suggests foreign tactical influence from the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Despite these challenges, Mexico has the potential to respond effectively by strengthening technological intelligence, investing in cyberdefense, creating a national anti-drone unit with civil and military personnel, and pursuing sustained, internationally coordinated strategies to modernize its security systems and turn the drone threat into a catalyst for innovation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 12:13 PM\nSource:[El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez](https://diario.mx/opinion/2025/oct/19/los-drones-del-crimen-y-la-necesidad-de-modernizar-los-sistemas-de-seguridad-1090068.html)\n\n**Russia Targets Civilian Infrastructure Across Multiple Ukrainian Regions**\nOn the night of October 17, 2025, Russia launched a series of intensive attacks using drones and missiles targeting civilian infrastructure across multiple Ukrainian regions, including energy facilities, residential buildings, and commercial structures. The strikes caused widespread damage and injuries. The city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro Oblast was heavily impacted, with a fire breaking out at an industrial facility and critical energy infrastructure destroyed. Nikopol and Bakhmutka were targeted by artillery and FPV drones. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, stating that 'the aggressor state deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure using dozens of drones and offensive missiles,' and accused Russia of continuing its 'systematic terrorism against Ukraine\u2019s energy sector.' According to the State Emergency Service of Dnipro Oblast, two women were injured in Nikopol, four private homes, three high-rise buildings, and several vehicles were damaged. In Chernihiv Oblast, a drone strike hit a timber-processing facility in the border town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, causing a fire and destroying production equipment and trucks. In Kherson, Russian forces targeted emergency responders with drones, igniting a fire in a high-rise building on the outskirts. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, regional military head Ihor Fedorov reported 618 Russian strikes on 18 settlements during the day, with 26 reports of damage to homes, vehicles, and infrastructure. A Ukrainian national police officer was injured in a drone attack in Bohodukhiv. A prior attack on October 16 in Chernihiv had also caused fires and property damage from debris of a downed drone. These attacks follow a broader pattern of escalating Russian strikes on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, aimed at disrupting power grids before winter, confirming Moscow\u2019s ongoing campaign of energy-related terrorism against Ukrainian civilians.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 06:52 PM\nSource:[arab.com.ua](https://arab.com.ua/ara/news/rosia-tsthdf-albnia-althtia-almdnia-fi-ada-1760716802.html)\n\n**Russian Low-Cost Drones Are Changing the Face of Its War in Ukraine - The Moscow Times**\nRussian low-cost drones, particularly the Molniya fixed-wing UAVs and FPV (first-person view) drones launched from motherships or relay systems, are significantly altering the dynamics of the war in Ukraine. Since mid-2023, drone flight ranges have expanded from 5\u201310 km to up to 40 km, enabling attacks deep into Ukrainian rear areas. In the Kherson region, the M-14 highway\u2014Ukraine\u2019s primary supply route\u2014has become a high-risk corridor, with Russian drones systematically targeting supply trucks and civilian vehicles. Ukrainian forces have responded with anti-drone nets, drone traffic lights, electronic warfare, and interceptor drones capable of shooting down enemy UAVs. Despite Ukraine\u2019s initial technological edge, Russia has dramatically scaled up drone production, launching 1,000\u20131,200 FPVs per day in April 2024\u2014up from 250 in early 2024\u2014and using over 30,000 in a single month (August 2024), five to six times more than a year earlier. Russia relies heavily on Chinese imports for dual-use components, as evidenced by recovered footage from a downed Gerbera drone showing Chinese factory test interfaces. Ukrainian analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko warns that if current trends continue, Russia could achieve parity with Ukraine in FPV drone usage by the end of 2025. While Ukrainian forces maintain an edge in active defense\u2014hunting drone launch sites and operators\u2014the disparity is most pronounced in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Russian forces have concentrated about 100,000 troops, overwhelming Ukrainian defenses. The conflict has evolved into a high-intensity, drone-centric battle, with both sides employing advanced tactics and countermeasures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:54 PM\nSource:[themoscowtimes.com](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/10/10/russian-low-cost-drones-are-changing-the-face-of-its-war-in-ukraine-a90779)\n\n**Ukrainian Forces Use FP-1 Drones in Attack on Russian City of Bataysk**\nOn the night of October 20 to 21, 2025, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched a drone attack on Bataysk, Rostov Oblast, using FP-1 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cumulative warheads weighing at least 50 kilograms and fragmenting elements consisting of 4-millimeter metal spheres. According to the Telegram channel Shot, the drones were likely launched from an airfield in Kryvyi Rih. Identification of the drone model was based on analysis of recovered fragments. Each FP-1 drone is estimated to cost approximately $55,000 (about 4.5 million rubles). The drones have a wingspan of 2.5 meters, a payload capacity of 60 to 120 kilograms, a maximum range of 1,600 kilometers, and a speed of 250 kilometers per hour. Their primary armament consists of cumulative charges, specifically OFB-60-YU high-explosive fragmentation warheads, supplemented with metal spheres for enhanced fragmentation effects. The attack caused damage to civilian infrastructure, including a multi-apartment residential building, though the structural integrity of the building was not compromised, allowing evacuated residents to return to their homes shortly after.

The attack, captured on video by multiple Ukrainian surveillance drones, occurred during a critical phase of the conflict, with the drone flying from about 15 kilometers away and striking the helicopter\u2019s fuel tank, causing it to crash into flames. The footage, widely shared and celebrated, including by Ukrainian President Volod\u00edmir Zelenski, marked the first documented case of a fully destroyed enemy helicopter using such a small drone. The Ukrainian command, led by 31-year-old Maxim from the 59th Brigade\u2019s 'Predators of the Heights' battalion, confirmed that the helicopter likely carried three to four Russian soldiers, all of whom perished. The incident highlights a strategic shift in modern warfare, where inexpensive drones are increasingly effective against high-value military assets\u2014such as the Mi-8, valued at around \u20ac6 million\u2014compared to costly anti-air missiles, which can cost up to \u20ac1 million each. The success has boosted morale among Ukrainian troops, who view the event as a turning point. Despite this, the broader situation remains dire: Russian forces control roughly 70% of Donetsk Oblast, and combat in the region remains intense, with Ukrainian forces gradually liberating areas and surrounding Russian troops. Russian sources, via Telegram, acknowledge severe mobility restrictions and logistical challenges. The operation underscores the growing role of drones in the war, with Ukraine producing millions annually, and has fueled Zelenski\u2019s push to exchange drones for long-range Tomahawk missiles with the U.S.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 03:46 AM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-10-21/david-contra-goliat-un-dron-ucranio-de-700-euros-desintegra-un-helicoptero-ruso-de-seis-millones.html)\n\n**Ground Drones Reshape Ukraine War: Robots Secure Surrenders, Reduce Casualties**\nThe battlefield dynamics of the Ukraine war are undergoing another transformation, this time through ground-based drones (Unmanned Ground Vehicles, UGVs), following the earlier impact of aerial drones. According to the Washington Post (WP), on June 2024, Ukraine's 3rd Assault Brigade used a remotely operated UGV equipped with approximately 63 kg of explosives\u2014three anti-tank mines\u2014to force the surrender of Russian soldiers in a frontline trench in northeastern Ukraine. After an initial explosion, the Ukrainian forces sent another UGV into the trench. While monitoring the scene via aerial drone footage, the Ukrainian remote operator observed a Russian soldier emerge and hold up a sign indicating surrender. Two Russian soldiers eventually surrendered unarmed, guided by the aerial drone to Ukrainian forces. The UGV unit commander, Mykola (26), stated that the best outcome was not capturing prisoners but avoiding any Ukrainian infantry casualties. The operation successfully reclaimed a strategic location in Kharkiv Oblast while preserving Ukrainian lives. WP analyzed official footage and interviewed commanders to reconstruct the operation, noting it demonstrated how drones\u2014first from the air and now from the ground\u2014are reshaping modern warfare. Ground drones are increasingly used not only for delivering supplies and evacuating troops but also for direct combat roles. Ukraine, facing a larger adversary, has prioritized drone deployment to minimize casualties and conserve limited manpower. The specific UGV model used in the June mission cost about $1,500 (2.13 million KRW), significantly less than operating artillery. According to Ukrainian military reports, the number of tasks completed by robots at the front lines in September nearly doubled compared to August. Ground drones range in size from smaller than a microwave to large enough to carry multiple personnel, and some are equipped with remotely operated machine guns to clear paths for ground troops.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 01:30 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251021051600009)\n\n**Small Suicide Drones Forced Russians to Surrender, Reshaping Ukraine\u2019s War Strategy**\nIn June 2024, Ukrainian forces used a small, bomb-laden unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to force Russian troops to surrender in Kharkiv, marking a pivotal moment in the war. The 138-pound explosive UGV, costing approximately $1,500 (NT$45,888), was deployed by Ukraine\u2019s 3rd Assault Brigade to destroy Russian defensive positions. After a series of coordinated attacks involving aerial drones for reconnaissance and suppression, the UGV entered a Russian trench complex and detonated, triggering a massive explosion. Following the blast, Russian soldiers emerged from their shelter\u2014handing in makeshift surrender signs, unarmed, and without body armor. A surveillance drone hovered above, guiding the surrendering soldiers to Ukrainian forces. This event, confirmed by The Washington Post through footage and interviews with brigade commanders, marked the first confirmed instance of Ukraine capturing enemy combatants using such a device. The success was attributed to precise coordination between drone operators and ground units. The use of low-cost, high-precision UGVs has transformed frontline operations, reducing Ukrainian casualties and enabling the retention of strategic positions despite being outnumbered. Ukrainian military leaders reported that the number of frontline missions conducted by UGVs nearly doubled between August and September 2024. These vehicles now perform a range of tasks, including supply delivery, evacuation, and direct assaults, with some equipped with remote-controlled machine guns. The war in Ukraine has become a real-world testing ground for future warfare, where unmanned systems are increasingly central to battlefield dynamics.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 12:52 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/122663/9083705)\n\n**Ukrainians Warned of New Russian Weapon 'Grom-1' Stronger Than 'Shahed': Details**\nUkrainian military analyst Stanislav Buniatov, known by the pseudonym 'Osman' in his Telegram channel 'Hovoryt Snayper,' warned of a significant increase in Russia's production of its new hybrid weapon, the 'Grom-1' bomb-rocket. This weapon combines a precision-guided aerial bomb with the X-38 missile system, capable of reaching targets up to 200 kilometers away, posing a heightened threat to Ukraine's deep rear areas. According to Buniatov, two main variants of the 'Grom-1' are currently being produced. The primary danger lies in its warhead weight\u2014approximately 250\u2013315 kg\u2014making it 3 to 5 times more destructive than the Shahed drone's payload. Buniatov emphasized that this dramatically increases the scale of destruction to civilian infrastructure during deep-rear attacks. He urged Ukrainians to remain vigilant and not ignore air raid warnings, as terrorism and deliberate targeting of civilians remain 'one of the main ways of conducting war' for Russia. This follows reports from October 16, 2025, of Russia testing upgraded guided aerial bombs (KABs) with a range exceeding 150 km near Mykolaiv, confirmed by Ukraine's Air Force. On October 20, Russia launched a KAB toward Poltava\u2014an unprecedented strike in the region\u2014and attacked a private home in the village of Orilka, resulting in civilian casualties.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 12:35 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ukrayina/viyskovyy-poperedyv-pro-novu-rosiysku-zbroiu-shcho-vidomo-2938499.html)\n\n**In 2023, a Ukrainian Pilot Had a Star Wars Idea. It Didn\u2019t Just Work\u2014It Rewrote the Manual of War**\nIn 2023, a Ukrainian drone instructor had a Star Wars-inspired idea: using low-cost quadcopters to crash into and destroy enemy drones in mid-air. What began as a joke among soldiers\u2014'too Star Wars,' they said\u2014became the backbone of Ukraine\u2019s air defense within a year. Faced with a shortage of anti-air missiles and waves of low-cost Iranian Shahed drones, Ukrainian engineers and pilots redesigned commercial quadcopters into 'hit-to-kill' interceptors. Driven by necessity\u2014winter conditions, power outages, and overwhelmed conventional defenses\u2014this improvisation evolved into a formal doctrine. Crowdfunding initiatives like Come Back Alive and Dronefall coordinated production, training, and logistics, linking local manufacturers. These interceptors require speed (hundreds of km/h), advanced vision systems (including thermal cameras and semi-autonomous guidance), and sufficient kinetic or explosive payload to destroy targets on impact. Models like the Sting and Wild Hornets combine powerful rotors, thermal imaging, and lightweight warheads. The tactic\u2014detect, locate, launch, and maneuver within minutes\u2014is conceptually simple but operationally demanding. Ukraine aims to produce hundreds, eventually thousands, of interceptors per day, with reports of thousands of successful interceptions. A network of around twenty producers standardizes parts, training, and supply. On the ground, the system relies on a tight chain: radar or surveillance detection, rapid pilot or semi-autonomous system response, and launch with only minutes of window\u2014often just 10 minutes. Success depends heavily on pilot skill (training courses have low pass rates) and data link quality. Some interceptors are backpack-portable; others are mass-launched from containers. This adaptability allows responses tailored to target type\u2014e.g., slower Shaheds vs. faster Geran-3 drones. Ukrainian reports cite mass downings: hundreds destroyed in single attacks, with aggregate figures reaching thousands attributed to programs like Dronefall. Success rates vary from 30% to 90%, depending on system, target class, and crew proficiency. Economically, replacing a single expensive missile with dozens of low-cost interceptors preserves strategic resources and forces Russia to increase operational costs. The NATO sees these interceptors as a valuable complement to traditional defenses. The UK has committed to co-producing them, and trials in Denmark show interest in integrating them into national defense and critical infrastructure protection. The key lesson for Europe is the need for scalable, low-cost solutions against mass threats\u2014not just high-cost precision systems. However, technical limitations remain: limited range, vulnerability to electronic interference, and inability to engage high-altitude or extremely fast drones. The emergence of reactor-powered Shahed variants (Geran-3), which outpace current interceptors, demands rapid upgrades in propulsion, sensors, and autonomy. Human dependence on limited training remains a bottleneck. The next phase involves faster interceptors, more robust sensors, semi-autonomous systems, and integration with radar and missile defenses. Parallel efforts explore non-kinetic defenses\u2014lasers, microwaves, and electronic warfare systems\u2014to complement or replace physical interceptors when speed or altitude exceed their limits. Strategically, the most profound shift is doctrinal: modern air warfare can be won not by expensive, point-target systems, but by mass, affordable, distributed response. Ukraine has turned its lack of external missiles into an operational advantage through local manufacturing, civilian funding, and tactical adaptation. Yet, the warning remains: this edge is temporary. Adversaries adapt, technology scales, and sustained investment in design, production, and training is essential for long-term viability.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/magnet/2023-piloto-ucrania-tuvo-idea-star-wars-no-solo-salio-bien-su-plan-kamikaze-ha-reescrito-manual-guerra)\n\n**U.S. Intelligence Support for Ukraine\u2019s Long-Range Drone Campaigns: A Revealed Strategy**\nAccording to a report by KP.RU published on October 20, 2025, the United States is directly providing Ukraine with satellite-based intelligence to plan and execute long-range drone attacks on Russian strategic targets deep inside Russian territory. The article cites the Financial Times, which reported that U.S. military intelligence personnel are involved at every stage of these operations, including target selection, route planning, and real-time data transmission via Starlink. While Ukraine selects the targets, the U.S. provides critical reconnaissance data on target vulnerabilities, terrain, weather, and air defense systems. The process takes approximately one day for data collection and another day for processing, followed by encrypted transmission to Ukraine. The article notes that the U.S. satellite surveillance network around Ukraine includes over 120 spacecraft, both military and dual-use commercial satellites, managed by the U.S. National Space Intelligence Agency. Despite U.S. officials not commenting on the report, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov instructed his team to seek clarification from American counterparts. Military expert Mikhail Timoshenko explained that the U.S. enables these attacks by providing data on terrain concealment, weather conditions, and optimal flight paths. He also noted that while countering such attacks is difficult due to the vastness of Russian territory, options like shooting down satellites or hacking Starlink are considered too risky or impractical. The report concludes by highlighting that Ukraine and the U.S. are jointly producing a new long-range drone, Artemis ALM-20, with a range of 1,600 km and a 45 kg warhead, explicitly designed for attacks on Russia, raising questions about the U.S. role in the conflict\u2014whether as a peace broker or an active participant.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 12:32 PM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27731/5159075/)\n\n**Drones of Crime and the Urgent Need to Modernize Security Systems**\nAn explosive drone attack on the Baja California Attorney General's office in Tijuana, near the U.S. border, confirmed that organized crime now uses aerial methods to challenge state authority. The device, loaded with nails and metal fragments, damaged several vehicles and caused panic among staff but resulted in no fatalities or injuries. The attack, attributed by Baja California's Attorney General Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade to a powerful criminal group, is strongly linked to the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG), based on its history of similar drone attacks in Michoac\u00e1n, Guanajuato, and Zacatecas. The U.S. Consulate in Tijuana issued a security alert, underscoring the seriousness of the incident. Drones used in such attacks are low-cost, with basic hobbyist FPV models costing $100\u2013$300 and more advanced attack-ready systems priced between $600 and $2,000, often with an effective cost of around $800. The ease of acquisition and operation\u2014using internet-connected FPV technology\u2014has enabled criminal groups to rapidly adopt drones for surveillance, drug transport, and now, as weapons. In response, Mexico\u2019s federal government has deployed armed drones, signal-jamming equipment, AI-powered detection systems, and implemented mandatory civilian drone registration, alongside intelligence sharing with U.S. agencies. However, criminal innovation outpaces state defenses: attackers use high-performance FPV and fiber-optic drones\u2014similar to those seen in Ukraine\u2014operated by trained personnel, including former military and police, as well as skilled gamers and technicians. Evidence also suggests foreign tactical influence from the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Despite these challenges, Mexico has the potential to respond effectively by strengthening technological intelligence, investing in cyberdefense, creating a national anti-drone unit with civil and military personnel, and pursuing sustained, internationally coordinated strategies to modernize its security systems and turn the drone threat into a catalyst for innovation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 12:13 PM\nSource:[El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez](https://diario.mx/opinion/2025/oct/19/los-drones-del-crimen-y-la-necesidad-de-modernizar-los-sistemas-de-seguridad-1090068.html)\n\n**Russia Targets Civilian Infrastructure Across Multiple Ukrainian Regions**\nOn the night of October 17, 2025, Russia launched a series of intensive attacks using drones and missiles targeting civilian infrastructure across multiple Ukrainian regions, including energy facilities, residential buildings, and commercial structures. The strikes caused widespread damage and injuries. The city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro Oblast was heavily impacted, with a fire breaking out at an industrial facility and critical energy infrastructure destroyed. Nikopol and Bakhmutka were targeted by artillery and FPV drones. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, stating that 'the aggressor state deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure using dozens of drones and offensive missiles,' and accused Russia of continuing its 'systematic terrorism against Ukraine\u2019s energy sector.' According to the State Emergency Service of Dnipro Oblast, two women were injured in Nikopol, four private homes, three high-rise buildings, and several vehicles were damaged. In Chernihiv Oblast, a drone strike hit a timber-processing facility in the border town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, causing a fire and destroying production equipment and trucks. In Kherson, Russian forces targeted emergency responders with drones, igniting a fire in a high-rise building on the outskirts. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, regional military head Ihor Fedorov reported 618 Russian strikes on 18 settlements during the day, with 26 reports of damage to homes, vehicles, and infrastructure. A Ukrainian national police officer was injured in a drone attack in Bohodukhiv. A prior attack on October 16 in Chernihiv had also caused fires and property damage from debris of a downed drone.

Stage 1 involved inexpensive, lightweight drones like 'Maviki' used primarily for reconnaissance, with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense failing to centrally supply drones, leaving units and volunteers to manage procurement. These drones were soon used for dropping ordnance (VOGs, 40-mm HEDP, fragmentation grenades), identifying enemy equipment, fortifications, and troop concentrations, as well as correcting artillery fire and guiding missile strikes. Stage 3 saw the emergence of FPV drones equipped with various warheads, enabling targeted attacks on all types of targets, from civilian vehicles to armored units and artillery. The article also addresses countermeasures: initial success with multi-channel electronic warfare (EW) against standard FPV drones was undermined by fiber-optic FPV drones, whose data transmission via fiber cannot be jammed. Other emerging threats include heavy drone bombers, FPV ambushes, and remote mine placement. The author stresses that the primary defense against all FPV drones is physical destruction through shot (shotgun, buckshot, or bullets), necessitating strict new operational protocols. These include constant vigilance over large drone zones (tens of kilometers), keeping 12-gauge shotguns or similar weapons ready, and training drills to automate responses. The author sharply criticizes personnel for 'laziness and apathy,' which directly cause equipment losses, casualties, and injuries.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:01 PM\nSource:[expert.com.ua](https://expert.com.ua/206514-masove-zastosuvannya-bpla-vymahae-novyh-standartiv.html)\n\n**Ukraine War: How Russian Drones Target Civilians, Humanitarians, and Journalists**\nThe article details the escalating use of Russian FPV drones as lethal weapons targeting civilians, humanitarian workers, and journalists in Ukraine. Since early 2024, these low-cost, real-time video-equipped drones have created 'kill zones' along the front lines, with the UN documenting at least 395 deaths and 2,635 injuries from short-range drone attacks between February 2022 and April 2025. The death of French photojournalist Antoni Lallican on October 3, 2024, in Komychouvakha, Donetsk region, exemplifies this trend, as he and two colleagues were targeted while covering military fortifications. The article highlights how Russian soldiers, via Telegram, openly designate civilians and humanitarian personnel as legitimate targets in 'red zones' and broadcast attack footage. Journalists like Inna Varenytsia report that front-line reporting has become increasingly dangerous, with drones now targeting civilian vehicles even in urban areas like Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk. The use of fiber-optic drones, undetectable by standard systems, has rendered many countermeasures ineffective. Reporters now conceal press vests, adopt camouflage clothing, and consider armed self-defense\u2014though doing so risks losing protected civilian status under international law. The article also underscores the growing precarity of media work, with outlets abandoning advance planning and shifting full safety responsibility onto reporters. Inna Varenytsia, whose husband Maks Levin was killed in 2022, expresses deep personal conflict between her professional duty and fear of leaving her five-year-old son orphaned.

Since mid-2023, drone flight ranges have expanded from 5\u201310 km to up to 40 km, enabling attacks deep into Ukrainian rear areas. In the Kherson region, the M-14 highway\u2014Ukraine\u2019s primary supply route\u2014has become a high-risk corridor, with Russian drones systematically targeting supply trucks and civilian vehicles. Ukrainian forces have responded with anti-drone nets, drone traffic lights, electronic warfare, and interceptor drones capable of shooting down enemy UAVs. Despite Ukraine\u2019s initial technological edge, Russia has dramatically scaled up drone production, launching 1,000\u20131,200 FPVs per day in April 2024\u2014up from 250 in early 2024\u2014and using over 30,000 in a single month (August 2024), five to six times more than a year earlier. Russia relies heavily on Chinese imports for dual-use components, as evidenced by recovered footage from a downed Gerbera drone showing Chinese factory test interfaces. Ukrainian analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko warns that if current trends continue, Russia could achieve parity with Ukraine in FPV drone usage by the end of 2025. While Ukrainian forces maintain an edge in active defense\u2014hunting drone launch sites and operators\u2014the disparity is most pronounced in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Russian forces have concentrated about 100,000 troops, overwhelming Ukrainian defenses.

He also stressed that the most effective countermeasures remain strikes on strategic targets deep inside Russia, including oil refineries funding the war and factories producing drones, as well as disrupting enemy pilot training sites and drone launch points.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 05:26 PM\nSource:[Gazeta.ua](https://gazeta.ua/articles/np/_civilnim-vzhe-zaraz-treba-vchitisya-voloditi-rushniceyu-vijskovi/1232191)\n\n**Ukrainian Battalion Commander Urges Civilians to Learn Rifle Shooting to Counter Russian Drone Attacks**\nCommander of the 429th Separate Drone Battalion, Achilleus Yurii Fedorenko, stated on Radio NV that Ukrainian civilians must begin learning to shoot rifles now to counter Russian drone attacks, particularly those targeting fiber-optic infrastructure. He emphasized that certain drones can strike up to 70 km from the front line, with Kharkiv being especially vulnerable due to its proximity to the conflict zone. Fedorenko warned that critical logistical corridors\u2014referred to as 'lifeline corridors'\u2014must be protected and maintained, as their failure after enemy drone attacks turns them into 'corridors of death.' He noted that in rural areas, shooting down large FPV drones, such as those used for fiber-optic attacks, is feasible without significant risk to bystanders. He stressed that civilian preparedness, including proficiency with firearms, is a vital defensive tool. Additionally, he identified key countermeasures: disrupting Russian war financing by targeting oil refineries (NPPs), destroying drone manufacturing facilities, locating and eliminating enemy drone pilots and training sites, and neutralizing launch points for reconnaissance and strike drones. Russian forces have been conducting daily drone strikes across Ukraine, including on cities far from the front line, using long-range 'Shahed' drones and similar models. The Ukrainian military has responded by deploying anti-drone nets across dozens of kilometers of roads and streets, creating protective 'tunnels.' The enemy aims to establish a 'dead zone' up to 10 km wide in frontline areas, where any movement is exposed to drone attacks.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 04:01 PM\nSource:[unian](https://www.unian.ua/war/viyna-v-ukrajini-fedorenko-vvazhaye-shcho-civilni-ukrajinci-mayut-navchitisya-strilyati-z-rushnici-13154190.html)\n\n**The New 'Impossible' Attacks on Ukraine Bring WWII to the 21st Century**\nRussia has reportedly developed a new capability to attack moving railway targets in Ukraine using modified Shahed kamikaze drones, marking a significant escalation in the war. According to evidence from Kyiv and videos shared by Ukrainian citizens on social media, these drones\u2014previously limited to fixed targets\u2014have been adapted with cameras and mobile modems, enabling real-time video transmission and potential remote guidance by human operators. This allows them to track and strike moving trains, such as in a recent attack near Bobrovytsya, over 150 kilometers from the front line. Russian Telegram channels claimed the drones evaded Ukrainian aircraft and hit both locomotives and freight cars. The modification transforms the Shahed from a 'dumb' disposable weapon into a precision-guided system, with the potential for autonomous operation via artificial intelligence. The Ukrainian railway system, critical for both military and civilian logistics\u2014especially with airports closed\u2014is now under unprecedented threat. The Ukrainian railway chief noted a 'drastic increase' in Russian drone production, enabling the use of low-cost drones for high-value targets. Minister of Territorial Development Oleksiy Kuleba stated the goal is to disrupt passenger and freight transport, destabilize operations, and pressure the civilian population. These attacks are part of a broader campaign of aerial terror: in September alone, Russia launched 5,636 drones and 187 missiles\u201438% more than in August\u2014targeting residential buildings, shopping centers, train stations, and power plants. The conflict has become the first major war where unmanned aerial vehicles are central to both sides, ushering in a new era of warfare comparable to the 'blitzkrieg' of 1939, characterized by constant surveillance, low-cost precision strikes, and the ability to project lethal threats across the entire territory at any time.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 12:50 PM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/novaceno/2025-10-02/nuevos-ataques-rusos-drones-contra-trenes_4220717/)\n\n**Drones Kamikazes: New Weapon of Jihadists in the Sahel with Ukrainian Support**\nAn article from MALIWEB reports a new trend in the Sahel: jihadist groups such as JNIM and the FLA are increasingly using modern weapons, notably FPV drones, to carry out attacks against government forces (Article). In Mali, the government confirmed on 1 July 2025 that drone kamikazes were used against western localities (Article). In Burkina Faso, more than a dozen similar attacks have been recorded since February, including deadly strikes on Djibo and Diapaga in May (Article). The Nigerien side suffered a first suicide\u2011drone attack on 25 May 2025, killing 64 soldiers at a position near the Mali border (Article). The article states that these drones, originally designed for civilian use, are now repurposed for military use, marking a turning point in the regional conflict (Article). It also cites reports that Ukraine has supplied drones and training to jihadists in Mali, with Ukrainian instructors operating through Mauritania to avoid detection (Article). The Sahel States Alliance condemned this interference, accusing Kyiv of actively supporting terrorist groups, a claim later substantiated by the discovery of Ukrainian\u2011made drones in militants\u2019 possession (Article). The article notes that the JNIM and Azawad separatists have expanded drone\u2011assisted operations to Togo and other neighboring countries during 2024\u20112025, posing a major challenge to Sahelian armies already weakened by years of instability (Article).\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[MALIWEB](https://www.maliweb.net/contributions/drones-kamikazes-nouvelle-arme-des-djihadistes-au-sahel-avec-le-soutien-ukrainien-3109638.html)\n\n**Russia's Attack on Ukraine Starts the Era of Robotized Warfare \u2013 24 Kanal**\nThe article reports that the war between Russia and Ukraine has evolved into a full\u2011scale technological conflict in which 70\u201180\u202f% of casualties are caused by unmanned aircraft. Over the past 3.5\u202fyears the fighting has become a continuous \u201ccat\u2011and\u2011mouse\u201d game, with each new weapon system providing only a short\u2011term advantage of two to three months before the opponent develops countermeasures. 24\u202f\u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b notes that it holds exclusive rights to translate and publish a Project\u202fSyndicate column, which was originally posted on the syndicate\u2019s website.\n\nThe author describes the current stage of robotised warfare as visible in the air, on the ground and at sea. Ukrainian teams, working from garages, basements and factories, have produced new drone and interceptor models that use artificial\u2011intelligence and machine\u2011learning to detect and destroy \u2018Shahed\u2019 drones, achieving 60\u201170\u202f% success rates on the most effective nights.\n\nRussia\u2019s rapid deployment of weapons is illustrated by the launch of 728 \u2018Shahed\u2019 drones in a single day on 9\u202fJuly, and the deployment of more than 6\u202f200 by the end of the month \u2013 14\u202ftimes the number in July\u202f2024 and 16\u202f% higher than in June. 24\u202f\u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b highlights that Russian factories operate 24\u202fhours a day.\n\nThe article quotes that \u2018\u0428\u0430\u0445\u0435\u0434\u0438\u2019 are becoming smarter: they now fly beyond 3\u202fkm, can reach speeds of 700\u202fkm/h, and some are equipped with thermal\u2011vision, upgraded processors and autonomous swarm coordination, allowing them to evade pursuit.\n\nOn the ground, FPV drones with optical cable links can strike targets up to 30\u202fkm from the front line, and both sides use \u2018sleeping\u2019 drones that wait for a target to appear. Autonomous ground vehicles are now deployed at scale for logistics, resupply, evacuation, mine\u2011laying and attacks, with Ukraine reportedly leading in this area.\n\nIn July, Ukraine\u2019s 3rd Assault Brigade carried out a fully autonomous operation that forced Russian forces to surrender in the Kharkiv region without direct Ukrainian infantry involvement.  The article also notes the use of sea drones to push Russian ships out of the Black Sea; on 31\u202fDecember\u202f2024 the Ukrainian sea drone \u2018Magura\u202fV5\u2019, armed with a ground\u2011to\u2011air missile, destroyed a Russian Mi\u20118 helicopter over the Black Sea \u2013 the first time a surface\u2011to\u2011air drone has downed a piloted aircraft.\n\nThe piece concludes that autonomous systems are now central to battlefield success, with Ukrainian drone units operating like high\u2011performance tech startups, each with its own data\u2011architecture, training, funding and team culture.  One of the most successful new players is Swift\u202fBeat, founded by former Google CEO Eric\u202fSchmidt, which plans to deploy hundreds of thousands of drones this year.\n\nThe article stresses that many new technologies are being developed by thousands of volunteers and civil society rather than large defence contractors, and calls on NATO and its allies to study and strengthen support for Ukraine, as robotised warfare is already underway.\n\n'The war has become a continuous cat\u2011and\u2011mouse game, with each new weapon system providing only a short\u2011term advantage of two to three months before the opponent develops countermeasures,' the author writes.\n\n'The deployment of 728 Shaheds in a single day on 9\u202fJuly and more than 6\u202f200 by the end of the month \u2013 14\u202ftimes the number in July\u202f2024 and 16\u202f% higher than in June \u2013 illustrates Russia\u2019s rapid scaling of effective weapon systems.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: August 31, 2025 05:20 AM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/napad-rosiyi-ukrayinu-rozpochala-eru-robotizovanoyi-viyni_n2901844)\n\n**Ukraine's War: The Rise of Drones and the Democratization of Aerial Attacks**\nThe war in Ukraine has seen a revolution in tactics with the use of remote attacks, adapted arms, and aerial combat between drones. Swarms of kamikaze drones and precision attacks have taken center stage, changing the way battles are fought. The most important aspect is that these attacks have become increasingly intense and unpredictable in recent times. A new form of warfare has emerged, where drones are used to launch drones, making them a game-changer in the conflict. 'It's like the work of a sniper,' said Dima, a Ukrainian soldier, while showing a video of a FPV drone pursuing a Russian soldier until it hit him with precision. The democratization of aerial attacks has eliminated the idea of safe places. With their accessibility and effectiveness, any unit, even without air force support, can carry out precise attacks. Samuel Bendett, a drone expert at the Naval Analysis Center, explained that drones have gone from being a novelty in 2022 to a dominant offensive tool in 2023 - and now they dominate the tactical field. With speed, range of up to 20 km, night operation, and low cost, they have become perfect tools for guerrilla warfare. Armored vehicles need to move constantly, and troops can no longer stay in one place for long. Many traditional tactics have become obsolete. Drones 'mother' and combined attacks are one of the latest strategies, where large drones transport and launch kamikaze drones in mid-air. This way, the small FPV drones can reach enemy targets behind the lines without wasting energy before the attack. A documented case showed a Ukrainian drone-mother taking down a Russian reconnaissance drone, revealing that there are now aerial battles between drones of different types. Since the start of the war, Ukraine has adapted drones to carry explosives, grenades, and missiles. But recently, it has advanced in the use of attached firearms, both in aerial and ground drones. There are records of FPV drones firing shotguns against Russian drones. Engineers have corrected recoil problems, allowing them to fire multiple times without losing stability. A video showed a drone of this type taking down three opponents in the air before attacking a soldier on the ground. Tests with AK-74 rifles mounted on drones have also been conducted, allowing for bursts against enemy trenches. They are not yet used on a large scale, but the trend of arming drones with conventional arms is growing. Additionally, drones equipped with claws or magnets to capture enemy drones in the air have been used, reminiscent of arcade games. Another example is the Pliushch, a non-armed ground drone that carries a 10-meter communication mast. It acts as a repeater to amplify communication range and also as a mobile electronic warfare station to block enemy signals. Electronic warfare on the front line has intensified to the point where many drones have become inoperable due to signal blocking. To counter this, Ukraine has started using fiber-optic drones, which avoid detection by not emitting electromagnetic signals.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 10, 2025 10:43 AM\nSource:[clickpetroleoegas.com.br](https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/tempos-loucos-de-guerra-na-ucrania-agora-drones-lancam-drones-para-atacar-outros-drones-rpc95/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasters assess that, despite the rising global use of weaponized aerial drones by non-state actors in conflict zones (e.g., Ukraine), criminal organizations (notably near the US-Mexico border), and the increasing ease of drone modification and acquisition, the probability of a terrorist drone attack causing injury or death in the US before January 1, 2026 remains low but non-negligible. Key factors increasing risk include the rapid diffusion of drone warfare tactics, criminal innovation near US borders (especially by Mexican cartels), and the democratization of drone technology. However, significant mitigating factors dominate: no successful or credibly reported terrorist drone attack with casualties has occurred on US soil to date (base rate is zero); US law enforcement and intelligence agencies have strong countermeasures, enhanced vigilance, and coordination; and the window for such an event is rapidly closing (about 2 months remain). Forecasters consistently emphasize the high bar set by the resolution criteria (injury or death, explicit terrorism attribution, credible reporting), operational and technical challenges, and the lack of recent plots or near-misses within the US. Most experts assign probabilities in the 5-8% range, highlighting real but low short-term risk, with near-term persistence of the status quo likely but acknowledgment that the threat is rising for the longer-term future.",
