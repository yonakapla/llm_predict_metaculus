Apple\u2019s core resources (ecosystem control, App Store revenue) create massive disincentives to allow sideloading in the US. The US legal/regulatory environment lacks a DMA-equivalent; ongoing antitrust cases are unlikely to resolve in time, and there is no sign of imminent, binding regulation. Apple\u2019s technical capability to allow sideloading (developed for the EU) slightly increases the probability, but the company\u2019s history of region-specific compliance and ongoing political pushback further reduce it. While there is always nonzero risk of a black swan event (e.g., an unexpected court injunction), the probability that sideloading or third-party app stores will be allowed on iPhones in the US before 2026 is extremely low.",

The forecaster also appropriately notes that the US has not passed comparable legislation and that even if antitrust cases succeed, remedies are often incremental and slow to implement. The emphasis on the short time frame\u2014less than three months until resolution\u2014further strengthens their argument, as any seismic legal or regulatory change would almost certainly have surfaced publicly by now. This analysis wisely discounts the scenario of voluntary compliance and underscores the robustness of the status quo in the absence of binding legal compulsion, making their probability of 1 justified."

The original question opened on 2023-02-19 15:55:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/14135). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn 14 September 2022 the [Regulation 2022/1925 on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (better known as the Digital Markets Act or DMA) was adopted](https://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/cl5qyuy0o1h0y0a59y4osbiqx/digital-markets-act-is-adopted). Its primary aim are issues regarding [contestability and fairness in the digital economy](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/digital-markets-act-dma-goes-live), with a focus on prohibitions and obligations imposed upon Big Tech. The DMA impacts a wide variety of companies such as Amazon, Google, or Apple, with an anticipated enforcement date of March 2024.\n\nThe [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/0c2d56f7-a402-45ea-8aa6-0e05e6260b68) reported that the DMA represents the \u201cbiggest threat to [Apple\u2019s] control over its operating system in 15 years\u201d. \n\n> Apple is laying the groundwork to comply with tough new EU rules that will allow iPhone users to pick apps from beyond its own App Store, as developers seek to skirt the up to 30 per cent fee imposed by the US tech giant.\n\nThis comes against the backdrop of Apple\u2019s legal fight with Fortnite maker Epic Games about Epic\u2019s own app store that resulted in Apple pulling Fortnite from their App Store. The DMA may make it illegal for Apple to prohibit other app stores on their phones.\n\nHowever, as the [Financial Times]( https://www.ft.com/content/0c2d56f7-a402-45ea-8aa6-0e05e6260b68) reports, a potential workaround for Apple could be \u201csideloading\u201d, where users are able to install software directly via a browser (without using rival app stores). \n\nWhile the DMA only applies to the EU, there is also the possibility of a regulatory spill-over to other jurisdictions.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":14135,\"question_id\":14137}}`",

Apple's lawyer, Daniel Beard, presented three main objections before the General Court in Luxembourg: first, that interoperability requirements forcing iPhone services to work with rival hardware threaten user privacy, security, and intellectual property; second, that the App Store should not be subject to DMA rules because it does not constitute a 'single service' under the law's definition; and third, that the EU's attempt to investigate iMessage under the DMA was unjustified, as it does not directly generate revenue. EU Commission lawyer Paul-John Loewenthal countered that Apple's 'absolute control' over the iPhone ecosystem has enabled 'supernormal profits' and created an uneven playing field, locking in over a third of European smartphone users. The DMA, enacted in 2023, targets dominant digital platforms with strict obligations. Apple is also challenging a \u20ac500 million ($581 million) fine related to the App Store, following a previous \u20ac1.8 billion antitrust penalty for similar conduct. Other tech giants, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Booking Holdings, have also been affected. Apple\u2019s case is the most direct assault on the DMA\u2019s enforcement, following an earlier setback for ByteDance over TikTok. The EU has issued over \u20ac9.5 billion in fines against Google and ordered Apple to pay \u20ac13 billion in back taxes to Ireland.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 05:40 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/apple-challenges-eu-digital-markets-act-in-biggest-antitrust-court-test-125102100940_1.html)\n\n**Apple Challenges EU Digital Markets Act at European Court**\nApple has filed a formal complaint before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg against the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), according to Bloomberg. Apple's legal team criticized the DMA rules as excessively burdensome, specifically opposing three provisions: mandatory interoperability with third-party hardware, inclusion of the App Store under DMA regulations, and an ongoing investigation into the iMessage messaging service. In response, the European Commission's legal representative argued that Apple has generated above-average profits through exclusive control of the iPhone ecosystem and has locked in more than one-third of European smartphone users. The dispute has a long history: in April 2025, Apple was fined \u20ac500 million for allegedly violating DMA rules, following a prior \u20ac1.8 billion penalty for anti-competitive behavior related to music streaming apps. While other tech giants\u2014including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Booking Holdings\u2014are also subject to the DMA, Apple's complaint is considered the most aggressive legal challenge to date. ByteDance's similar attempt to challenge TikTok\u2019s inclusion under the DMA had previously failed.

Apple contested the 2023 decision labeling its iPhone software and App Store as core platform services, arguing that compliance with the DMA\u2019s interoperability requirements would compromise its intellectual property, privacy, and security. Apple attorney Daniel Beard claimed that exposing software code and trade secrets would amount to a 'deprivation of a key part of that right.' The European Commission countered that Apple had not identified any specific intellectual property at risk and emphasized that the DMA balances competition with fundamental rights. Intervening groups, including the European Parliament, the Council, Free Software Foundation Europe, and the Coalition for App Fairness, supported the Commission, stressing that interoperability is essential for fair competition. Disputes also centered on Apple\u2019s argument that its App Stores for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Watch, and TV serve distinct audiences and should not be treated as a single gateway\u2014contrary to the Commission\u2019s view that they function as one unified ecosystem. Additionally, the Commission\u2019s probe into iMessage as a 'number-independent interpersonal communications service' was challenged by Apple, which argued the app is free, ad-free, and non-commercial, thus not qualifying under the DMA. The Commission responded that iMessage indirectly boosts device sales and therefore falls under the law. The court examined whether the gatekeeper designation immediately imposes binding duties, with Apple claiming it does, and the Commission asserting that some aspects of the challenge involve preparatory steps without legal effect. A judgment is expected in 2026. The outcome will determine the extent of Apple\u2019s control over its App Store and devices, test the enforceability of the DMA, and set a precedent for other tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta.

The company's lawyer, Daniel Beard, claimed the law disregards core EU values such as property rights, privacy, and security.

The European Commission's representative, Paul-John Loewenthal, countered that Apple's 'absolute control' over the iPhone creates an unfair barrier to market entry, allowing it to extract excessive profits. The case is pivotal: a loss for Apple could set a precedent for other tech giants challenging DMA compliance. Other companies, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Booking Holdings, have also been forced to alter their operations under the DMA. Apple's appeal follows a \u20ac500 million (approx. $581 million) fine imposed by EU regulators, which the company is contesting separately. The EU has previously fined Google over \u20ac9.5 billion and ordered Apple to pay \u20ac13 billion in back taxes to Ireland.

During a hearing at the General Court in Luxembourg, Apple's lawyer Daniel Bird argued that the DMA imposes 'burdensome obligations and unjustified interference' that violate Apple's rights within the EU's single market. The DMA, which came into effect in 2023, enforces strict rules limiting the power of tech giants by defining what they can and cannot do. The law has drawn criticism from former U.S. President Donald Trump and has strained trade talks between Brussels and Washington. Apple is challenging the DMA on three main grounds: (1) being forced to make its devices and services compatible with competitors' products like headphones and smartwatches, which Apple claims threatens user privacy, security, and intellectual property rights; (2) the inclusion of the App Store under the law, despite Apple's argument that it is a 'multi-service platform' not subject to the same legal definitions; and (3) the European Commission\u2019s attempt to investigate iMessage, which generates no direct revenue. The EU\u2019s legal representative, Paul Jon Loewenthal, countered that Apple maintains 'absolute control' over the iPhone ecosystem, granting it exceptional profits and blocking fair competition, stating, 'Only Apple holds the keys to this closed system, deciding who gets in and who is excluded.' The DMA also applies to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Booking.com, but Apple\u2019s case is considered the most significant and impactful, especially after TikTok (ByteDance) lost a prior appeal. In April 2025, the EU fined Apple \u20ac500 million for violating rules allowing developers to direct users to external payment methods, following a prior \u20ac1.8 billion fine related to music streaming apps. The case is seen as a pivotal moment that will shape the future relationship between the EU and Silicon Valley, as Brussels seeks greater control over companies it views as gatekeepers of the global digital economy.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 11:08 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/technology/in-focus/2025/10/21/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%82%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**Apple and Meta Near Breakthrough Deal with EU to Avoid Massive Fines**\nApple and Meta are on the verge of reaching a landmark agreement with the European Commission to resolve months-long regulatory disputes under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). According to reports by the Financial Times, Apple has agreed to modify App Store rules, including removing restrictions on steering users to external payment options and introducing a new fee structure: a 5% commission on purchases outside the App Store and a 'Core Technology Fee' for each annual app download exceeding one million installations. Meta is working on revising its advertising model to give users easier access to privacy-friendly ad options without requiring payment for an ad-free version. Although the deal has not yet been formally approved by Brussels, sources cited by FT indicate 'cautious optimism.' If finalized, the agreement could set a new benchmark for relations between 'big tech' firms and EU regulators. The Commission\u2019s more conciliatory stance may also reflect political considerations, as Donald Trump\u2014returning to the White House\u2014has previously criticized the EU for 'unfair treatment' of American companies, framing high fines and restrictions as economic protectionism. A successful deal could strengthen Brussels\u2019 negotiating position in future trade talks with the new U.S. administration. In April 2025, the European Commission imposed a \u20ac500 million fine on Apple for violating the 'steering' ban and a \u20ac200 million penalty on Meta for its 'consent or pay' model. Both companies appealed, arguing the Commission overstepped its authority and favored European and Chinese competitors. Meta called the penalties 'multibillion-euro tariffs' on American innovation. The DMA and Digital Services Act (DSA) are the two pillars of the EU\u2019s new digital regulatory framework. The DMA targets gatekeepers like Apple, Meta, Google, and Amazon by mandating fair competition, interoperability, and transparency\u2014requiring Apple to allow sideloading and Meta to offer real privacy choices. The DSA focuses on platform accountability for user-generated content, requiring rapid removal of illegal content, greater algorithmic transparency, and stronger consumer protection.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[nextgazetapl](https://next.gazeta.pl/next/7,151243,32312478,apple-i-meta-maja-dosc-gigantycznych-kar-przelomowe-porozumienie.html)\n\n**Report: Apple Nearing Agreement With EU Over App Store Rules**\nApple is reportedly nearing a settlement with the European Commission to resolve multiple antitrust investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aiming to avoid daily fines of up to 5% of its average global revenue. This follows a \u20ac500 million fine issued in April 2025 for violating the DMA\u2019s anti-steering provisions by restricting developers from directing users to external offers. The European Commission\u2019s investigation centers on Apple\u2019s App Store practices, particularly its control over payment systems and app distribution. In response, Apple introduced changes in June 2025, including allowing developers to promote alternative payment methods and distribute iOS apps through external marketplaces in the EU. However, ongoing talks focus on whether Apple\u2019s new developer contracts sufficiently remove barriers to fair competition, especially regarding developers\u2019 ability to communicate directly with users about external pricing without additional fees or restrictions. The DMA designates Apple as a 'gatekeeper' and mandates non-discrimination, fair access, and interoperability. Apple maintains it is already compliant and has appealed the initial ruling, arguing the Commission\u2019s interpretation exceeds the law\u2019s scope. The Commission continues gathering feedback from developers and stakeholders. Officials remain optimistic a resolution could be reached soon, with the outcome expected to significantly impact Apple\u2019s App Store operations in Europe.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 01:31 PM\nSource:[MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/08/apple-nearing-agreement-with-eu/)\n\n**Apple Urges EU to Abolish Digital Markets Act, Citing Innovation and User Safety Risks**\nApple has urged the European Commission to abolish the Digital Markets Act (DMA), arguing that the law fails to achieve its intended goals, harms European users, and stifles innovation within its technological ecosystem. The DMA, adopted by the European Union in 2022, aims to curb the dominance of major tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta, and promote competition with smaller firms. It grants the Commission broad powers to impose fines of up to 20% of global revenue for violations. Apple claims in its official consultation submission that the current DMA should be scrapped until a more suitable legislative tool is developed. The company argues that the law fails to balance competition protection with user safety, citing that its restrictions hinder innovation and delay the introduction of new technologies in Europe. Apple notes that compliance with DMA obligations has forced it to open certain system features to non-affiliated devices, causing delays in launching features such as real-time translation via AirPods and 'places visited' and 'preferred routes' in the Maps app\u2014features already available in other regions. The company also states that DMA mandates 'sideloading' (installing apps outside the official App Store) and allows alternative app markets and payment systems, which it claims increase user risks from fake apps, malware, and inadequate refund protections. This comes amid rising tensions, including a $587 million fine imposed by the EU in April 2025 for blocking developers from informing users about external offers. Apple called the fine 'unprecedented' and announced plans to appeal. Apple maintains that the DMA undermines the integrated user experience Apple users expect and delays access to new technologies, despite dedicating thousands of hours to compliance. The European Commission responded firmly, stating that compliance is a legal obligation, not optional. Analysts predict a prolonged legal battle, as Brussels insists the DMA protects competition and consumer rights, while Apple argues that the one-size-fits-all rules ignore differences in operating systems and may expose users to real risks.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0641\u062f](https://www.alwafd.news/5700142)\n\n**Europe's Digital Markets Act: Conflict and Confusion**\nThe European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), enacted three years ago, aims to regulate dominant tech 'gatekeepers'\u2014primarily American companies\u2014by requiring structural changes to promote competition. Under the DMA, Apple must reduce app store fees and allow third-party access to iOS; Google must stop favoring its own services in search; and Meta may need to offer a free, ad-free service. European regulators have already fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros and are preparing to penalize Google for noncompliance. The law has sparked transatlantic tensions: U.S. tech firms argue that DMA-mandated changes degrade product quality, compromise privacy and security, and delay European product launches. Apple delayed Live Translation and blocked iPhone Mirroring due to security concerns, while Google\u2019s inability to link directly to its Maps and travel sites has reportedly caused up to \u20ac114 billion in revenue losses, according to Alphabet\u2019s lawyer Oliver Bethell. Critics from both sides highlight enforcement gaps: competitors like Spotify claim Apple\u2019s compliance measures undermine the DMA\u2019s goal of consumer choice, while consumer groups such as BEUC call for faster enforcement. The European Commission is evaluating the DMA\u2019s effectiveness, with a recent consultation closing in September 2025. Despite calls from Apple and Google for repeal or reform, the Commission is likely to expand the law\u2019s scope to include cloud computing and AI services. Globally, the DMA has inspired similar laws in Japan, the UK, and other jurisdictions. Although the U.S. has not passed comparable legislation, federal antitrust actions against Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Google continue, with some cases seeking corporate breakup. The DMA enables faster regulatory action than traditional antitrust, but the required product changes are costly\u2014hundreds of thousands of engineering hours have been spent\u2014and often degrade user experience. The future remains uncertain: all three major tech firms are appealing fines and rulings to the European Court of Justice. Potential solutions include establishing an independent enforcement agency and expanding the DMA to cover AI and cloud services. The DMA continues to generate significant political, economic, and legal tension.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 07:51 PM\nSource:[CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/europes-digital-markets-act-conflict-and-confusion/)\n\n**EU Defends Digital Markets Act Against Apple Criticism**\nThe European Union rejected Apple\u2019s request to repeal the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law that entered force last year to curb abuses by dominant tech firms. Apple, which has opposed the DMA since its launch, argued that the regulation has degraded the services it offers and exposed users to new risks. In an official contribution to a Commission consultation, Apple said the DMA should be \"abrogated and replaced by a more suitable legislative text\" and proposed a separate regulatory agency to enforce the rules. The EU, however, categorically denied any intention to repeal the DMA. A Commission spokesperson, Thomas Regnier, said the EU was \"not surprised by Apple\u2019s lobbying arguments\" and that the company had \"continually contested every aspect of the DMA since its entry into force\". Apple also claimed the DMA forces it to restrict features on its products, citing the removal of the live\u2011translation function from the newly released AirPods Pro\u00a03 and the inability to open its devices to third\u2011party app stores or alternative payment systems. The company further alleged that the DMA has allowed pornographic apps to appear on iPhones, \"despite the risks they pose, especially to children\". The DMA, adopted in 2022 and effective from March\u00a02024, allows fines of up to 10\u202f% of a company\u2019s global turnover, rising to 20\u202f% for repeat violations. Apple has already paid a \u20ac500\u202fmillion fine in April for abusive clauses in its App Store, the first penalty imposed under the DMA. Apple is also under investigation for the Digital Services Act, which imposes obligations on platforms to protect users from illegal and harmful content.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 10:57 AM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**Apple Claims EU Digital Market Rules Target It Unfairly**\nThe European Commission fined Apple \u20ac500\u202fmillion in April for violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a rule that requires so\u2011called \"gatekeepers\" to allow third\u2011party developers to inform users of alternative offers outside the App\u00a0Store. Apple argues that the DMA has been applied in a politically motivated way that unfairly targets the U.S. tech giant.

In a submission to the Commission\u2019s first DMA review questionnaire, Apple stated that the rules 'should be repealed while a more appropriate fit for purpose legislative instrument is put in place.' Apple also claimed that the Commission has been 'highly responsive to external pressures ... resulting in a disproportionate focus on Apple' and that it has treated the DMA as a weapon against the company. The DMA designates seven gatekeepers in 2023\u20112024: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, ByteDance and Booking.com.

The DMA requires app creators to direct consumers toward external purchasing options, thereby loosening Apple\u2019s control over digital sales. The fine, announced on 29\u202fAugust\u202f2025, follows Apple\u2019s refusal to allow sideloading\u2014installing apps from third\u2011party stores\u2014which the DMA now permits. Apple has described the penalty as 'sin precedentes' and the required changes as 'ilegales', arguing that Brussels oversteps its authority. The legal battle is expected to last years, with developers exploring new distribution channels while raising concerns about security and visibility. The case illustrates the broader tension between EU regulation and tech giants, as the DMA seeks to increase competition but also introduces risks such as fraud and cyber\u2011attacks if alternative stores are not properly managed.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 05:18 PM\nSource:[Periodista digital](https://www.periodistadigital.com/tecnologia/20250829/multas-sideloading-reglas-europeas-apple-enfrenta-dma-bruselas-noticia-689405126398/)\n\n**Powerful EU Rules Regulating Tech and Annoying Trump: Orange News**\nThe article reports that U.S. President Donald Trump has strongly criticized the European Union\u2019s regulatory framework for the tech sector, threatening tariffs and export restrictions. It explains that the EU possesses the most powerful legal arsenal for digital regulation, having already imposed hefty fines on U.S. tech giants such as Meta and Apple. Brussels has refused to relax its two flagship laws \u2013 the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) \u2013 in trade negotiations with the United States.\n\nThe DSA aims to protect European users by imposing obligations on platforms, including:\n- establishing a reporting system for problematic content;\n- acting \"promptement\" to remove illicit content;\n- banning targeted advertising to minors.\nLarge platforms (X, TikTok, Meta, Apple, Google) face additional rules: they must assess risks related to illegal content, privacy, freedom of expression, health and public safety, and implement mitigation measures such as content moderation. They must also provide regulators and approved researchers with algorithmic access for compliance checks. Violations can lead to fines of up to 6\u202f% of annual turnover, and repeated serious breaches may result in a ban from operating in Europe.\n\nThe DMA seeks to end the dominant\u2011position abuse of tech giants (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) to protect startups and improve consumer choice. Key provisions include:\n- allowing users to uninstall pre\u2011installed services (browsers, maps, weather) and choose alternative app stores;\n- prohibiting cross\u2011platform data aggregation for targeted advertising without user consent.\nThe European Commission, with a team of about a hundred experts, holds enforcement power. Penalties can reach 10\u202f% of global turnover, and 20\u202f% for repeat offenders.\n\nThe article quotes the DSA\u2019s requirement for platforms to act \"promptement\" and highlights the EU\u2019s willingness to impose substantial fines, underscoring the tension between U.S. tech firms and European regulators.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Orange Actualit\u00e9s](https://actu.orange.fr/economie/les-puissantes-regles-de-l-ue-qui-encadrent-la-tech-et-agacent-trump-CNT000002klKeB.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse array of expert perspectives\u2014including US tech regulation and antitrust law, mobile software development, technology policy, and business strategy\u2014there is near-unanimous consensus that Apple will NOT allow sideloading or other app stores on iPhones in the United States before January 1, 2026. All experts note that, although Apple's compliance with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) has enabled sideloading and alternative app stores in Europe, Apple has explicitly geo-fenced these changes and vigorously resisted extending them to other regions, especially the US. \n\nKey points include:\n- The regulatory environment in the US is far less forceful than in the EU; no law equivalent to the DMA is in place or imminent, and US antitrust actions have so far focused on other App Store practices (such as payment systems and anti-steering rules), not on mandating sideloading or alternative app stores.\n- Apple has a strong financial and strategic incentive to maintain its closed ecosystem in the US, given the substantial revenue and competitive advantage derived from control over app distribution.\n- Ongoing court cases and legislative efforts in the US are moving slowly, with no credible sign of a regulatory or legal mandate that would force Apple to comply before the January 2026 deadline.\n- While some tail risk exists (e.g., a sudden court order or new legislation), base rates for such a rapid, dramatic shift in the US are exceedingly low.\n- The technical capability for sideloading is now proven (from EU compliance), but Apple shows no willingness to voluntarily enable it in the US absent direct compulsion.\n\nQuantitative forecasts range from 1% to 3%, reflecting only a minimal nonzero probability for a major, unforeseeable legal or regulatory event. The weight of evidence and all plausible scenarios indicate that Apple\u2019s status quo policy will hold in the US through at least the end of 2025.",
