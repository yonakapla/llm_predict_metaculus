Importantly, the fine print of the question makes clear that only explicit congressional action counts, not executive orders. The combination of business lobby opposition, bipartisan unease, risks to USMCA/WTO, and electoral incentives all point strongly against Congress passing such a bill. There is a small, nonzero chance that a Supreme Court ruling creates an emergency legislative push, but this is a narrow path with major obstacles.

News articles show Trump relying on executive orders, not legislative action; most of the disruption is happening via the executive branch. Legal challenges and the pending Supreme Court case raise the possibility of Congress being forced to act, but the timeline (by end of 2025) is tight, and there is no evidence of a fast-moving, unified legislative push. Lobbying and cross-pressures remain huge obstacles. Even with Trump's maximal leverage, the Senate's procedural hurdles and the diversity of economic interests represented make passage of a bill meeting the question's strict criteria (10%+ across-the-board, nearly all imports) exceedingly improbable. The status quo outcome is no passage, and the current news does not indicate imminent change.

The procedural hurdles in both chambers are magnified when interest groups are mobilized, amplifying the status quo bias.

From a lobbying affairs perspective, this global context profoundly amplifies domestic resistance: multinational firms, major exporters, and agricultural interests would all join forces to lobby against legislation that could plunge the US into retaliatory trade wars and litigation.

The procedural hurdles in the House and Senate are formidable, and the news flow shows no evidence of fast-tracked legislation or a legislative crisis. Even under scenario analysis, most plausible Congressional responses to a Supreme Court shock would be narrowly tailored, sector-specific, or temporary stopgaps\u2014none of which would meet the stringent criteria for resolution.

Their assessment that legal shocks (e.g., a Supreme Court ruling) are more likely to result in narrow, targeted legislative responses than in the kind of expansive, nearly-universal tariff bill required for a 'Yes' outcome is especially convincing.

From a Median Voter Theorem perspective, Congressional leaders are highly sensitive to the preferences of the median voter, who is risk-averse and likely to oppose broad new tariffs due to the threat of higher consumer prices and supply chain disruptions. Agenda-setting power is significant, but cannot overcome entrenched opposition from business lobbies, bipartisan moderates, and the negative electoral consequences of supporting inflationary policies. Furthermore, there is little to no evidence of agenda control producing a fast-moving, broad-based tariff bill in the current Congress.

They also correctly identify that even a Supreme Court decision limiting executive authority would likely be met with gridlock or minimal, sector-specific fixes rather than a sweeping, across-the-board tariff bill. The emphasis on the high costs and electoral risks associated with such legislation dovetails with the realignment view: while the GOP base is more open to protectionism, the coalition remains internally divided and legislative inertia prevails.

From an Interest Group Theory perspective, the scale and unity of opposition from importers, exporters, and consumer-facing industries create not just a barrier, but a formidable veto point that rarely breaks except in times of national crisis or war. The suggestion that Trump's unique political leverage and a Supreme Court ruling could trigger a narrow window for passage underestimates the inertia and status quo bias that organized interests can enforce, even under acute political pressure. As we've seen in prior trade fights, even when the executive branch is highly motivated, the legislative process is slow, subject to intense lobbying, and likely to fragment under cross-cutting pressures. The probability of Congress passing a bill that meets the strict 'across-the-board, 10%+' criterion by year-end, with no credible news of legislative movement, should be anchored even more closely to the low single digits."

The forecaster rightly notes that, even with looming legal uncertainty or a Supreme Court shock, the most likely Congressional response is minimalism\u2014narrow fixes or symbolic gestures rather than costly, broad-based action that would antagonize powerful, organized interests. Their understanding of procedural obstacles and status quo bias is also aligned with empirical findings from both Public Choice and legislative studies.

From my perspective in legislative process studies, their emphasis on the slow, contentious nature of major trade legislation and the short legislative window remaining in 2025 is especially persuasive.

The original question opened on 2024-12-20 20:59:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/31044). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has made tariffs a key component of his campaign. Following his election victory, on November 25, 2024, Trump reiterated his tariff proposals in two messages posted to Truth Social. [One of the messages](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215051155542) threatens to apply 25% tariffs on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico, notable for being US trade partners under the [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Mexico%E2%80%93Canada_Agreement) (USMCA), a free trade agreement:\n\n> As everyone is aware, thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before. Right now a Caravan coming from Mexico, composed of thousands of people, seems to be unstoppable in its quest to come through our currently Open Border. On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders. This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\n\nIn [the other message](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215408213585) Trump proposed a 10% tariff on all goods coming from China:\n\n> I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail. Representatives of China told me that they would institute their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this but, unfortunately, they never followed through, and drugs are pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before. Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nTrump has previously also proposed a [10% tariff on all imports](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-proposal-10-percent-1700-cost-per-us-household/) and [up to 60%](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-favors-huge-new-tariffs-how-do-they-work) on imports from China. Trump favors tariffs as a penalty on perceived negative behaviors of other countries and to [protect US industries and jobs](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china-truth-social/). However, economists widely agree that tariffs have negative impacts for Americans, through [price increases](https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/election-economic-policy-ideas/), [slower growth](https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/tariffs-technology-and-growth/), and [failure to improve general welfare](https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/steel-and-aluminum-tariffs/).\n\nWhile Trump as president would have [significant authority](https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress) to impose tariffs, his plans face a number of challenges. For one, an across-the-board tariff would seemingly apply to the United States' [free trade partners](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements), calling into question whether those agreements can remain viable under such a tariff regime. Additionally, the US as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is subject to WTO rules, including the [most-favored nation rule](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11030), which requires WTO members to grant similar tariff rates to other WTO members, with exceptions for countries which have free trade agreements and [in response to unfair practices](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm). Finally, while the president does have fairly broad tariff authority, Trump's proposals are expansive and [may exceed that authority](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/would-trumps-threats-new-tariffs-survive-legal-challenge-supreme).\n\nDue to the potential legal challenges, one possible pathway could be for Congress to pass a bill to impose Trump's proposed tariffs.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

The tariff will still be considered to be across-the-board if it excludes 10 or fewer UN member states.",

If exceptions are made such that some goods are subject to a tariff rate below 10%, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if, in the judgment of Metaculus, after accounting for the exceptions the vast majority of goods imported to the US would be subject to a 10% or greater tariff.\n* An across-the-board tariff does not need to be one rate applied to all goods, for example, a piecemeal approach that applies varying tariff levels of 10% or greater to nearly all goods would count.\n* The method of imposition in the bill is immaterial, so long as the specified tariff would be imposed. **This includes via methods such as** [**carbon border adjustments**](https://heatmap.news/sparks/carbon-border-adjustment-manchin-cassidy) **or a** [**destination-based cash flow tax**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destination-based_cash_flow_tax) **that would have the specified effect on imports.**\n* The date the tariff(s) would take effect is immaterial, only the passage of a bill which would implement such a tariff level in the future is required.\n* Pending legal challenges, either domestic or international, are immaterial. The question will still resolve as **Yes** if there are pending legal challenges, so long as the specified bill has been passed.\n* Metaculus will rely on credible reports that it deems to be most accurately representing the situation, including characterizations of the tariffs in such reporting, to determine whether nearly all imported goods are subject to the specified tariff.",

This marks the second time Trump has ended trade talks with Canada in 2025\u2014previously in June over dairy and tech tariffs, which were resolved after Canada removed tech-related duties. The current dispute is more symbolic, involving Reagan\u2019s message that long-term tariffs harm American workers and consumers, directly contradicting Trump\u2019s protectionist stance. The campaign, funded by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, aired during the American League Championship Series and is expected to continue during the World Series. Trump claims the ads aim to influence the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s November 5 decision on whether the President can impose tariffs under national security laws. With trade disruptions already affecting U.S. relations with China and Canada, the future of the trilateral USMCA (T-MEC) is uncertain. While Mexico\u2019s negotiations with the U.S. are 90% complete, progress depends on USTR\u2019s assessment of non-tariff barriers in customs, health, intellectual property, energy, and agriculture. The situation remains fragile, with potential for the T-MEC to fracture into three bilateral agreements. A key factor is whether Trump\u2019s upcoming Asia trip, including a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the APEC summit will yield a new U.S.-Mexico agreement. The next two weeks are critical, as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision could reshape trade policy and the future of North American economic integration.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 07:57 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/opinion/trump-vs-canada-ii-alerta-naranja-t-mec-20251024-783342.html)\n\n**Trump Ends Trade Negotiations with Canada Over Anti-Tariff Ad Campaign**\nOn October 24, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that 'all commercial negotiations with Canada are over,' citing a Canadian advertising campaign that criticized U.S. tariffs as an 'unacceptable provocation.' The campaign, broadcast in Canadian media, highlighted the negative impacts of U.S. tariffs on agricultural and manufactured goods. Trump stated that 'Canada is playing dirty' and vowed no further dialogue while Canada continues to attack U.S. trade policy. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed 'deep disappointment' but avoided direct confrontation. Ottawa reaffirmed its commitment to free trade and called on Washington to 'act with responsibility and mutual respect.' The U.S.-Canada bilateral trade volume exceeds $800 billion annually, according to the Peterson Institute, and sustained disruption could harm key sectors including automotive, energy, and agriculture. This move follows a series of protectionist actions, including new tariffs on European goods and restrictions on Asian technology imports. The U.S. Department of Commerce defended these actions as necessary to 'protect national interests.' The rupture threatens the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which remains in force but relies on ongoing dialogue now in jeopardy. Canada has convened emergency meetings with Mexico to assess alternative scenarios.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/internacional/america/trump-rompe-negociaciones-canada-anuncios-television-sus-aranceles-b50m_2025102468fb0dacf63c3c27fdb40175.html)\n\n**'Outrageous behavior.'

The Reagan Foundation confirmed the video was fake. Trump stated that Canada\u2019s 'outrageous behavior' justified ending all trade talks, emphasizing that tariffs are vital to U.S. national security and economic interests. On August 1, Trump signed an executive order increasing tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%, citing Canada\u2019s lack of cooperation in combating the illegal trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs. The new tariffs do not apply to goods covered under the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement).

The order establishes a baseline 10% tariff for countries not specifically listed, with rates varying based on trade imbalances and regional economic profiles. Specific rates include 15% for Lesotho (down from 50%), Taiwan (20%), Pakistan (19%), Israel, Iceland, Norway, Fiji, Ghana, Guyana, Ecuador, and several others; Switzerland faces a 39% tariff. Brazil\u2019s tariff was set at 10%, with the remaining 40% part of a separate measure approved earlier. The order capped off a high-pressure Thursday, with last-minute negotiations leading to agreements with South Korea, the EU, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Thailand\u2014particularly after the latter two agreed to a ceasefire. Mexico secured a 90-day negotiating period with the U.S., maintaining its current 25% tariff (down from 30%) and avoiding a planned increase, following a phone call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who described the outcome as a 'very successful' dialogue. Trump also raised the fentanyl-related tariff on Canada from 25% to 35%. The administration cited the need for harmonized rates and emphasized that tariffs would be borne by U.S. consumers and businesses, despite Trump\u2019s claim that the deals were 'excellent deals for the country.' No details were provided on the specific terms or nations involved in the new agreements. The move follows earlier tariff threats in April that triggered market panic and led to a 90-day negotiation extension.

The move followed a Canadian advertising campaign, funded by Ontario, that featured a 1987 speech by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, which Trump cited as a reason for the abrupt halt. Sheinbaum emphasized that Mexico\u2019s talks are progressing well, noting that Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will meet with the Trump administration during the APEC summit in South Korea the following week to finalize outstanding agreements. She acknowledged that the U.S. has raised several issues during the review of the USMCA (TMEC), which was signed in 2019, some of which Mexico does not view as barriers, but confirmed the process is 'well advanced.' She reiterated that the USMCA is expected to survive the 2026 review despite Trump\u2019s repeated threats to impose tariffs on Mexico and delay implementation.

Trump claimed the ad, which cost $75,000, contained 'false information' and was used 'fraudulently' to influence U.S. courts, including the Supreme Court. He declared that tariffs were 'absolutely critical to national security and the U.S. economy' and that all trade talks with Canada were canceled 'immediately.' The Reagan Presidential Foundation swiftly condemned the ad, stating it misrepresented Reagan\u2019s original message and that Ontario had not obtained permission to use or edit the footage. The foundation said it was 'evaluating legal options' and urged the public to view the unaltered original speech. Ontario Premier Doug Ford had posted the ad on X, stating the campaign had officially launched and vowing to use 'every available tool' to defend against U.S. tariffs, emphasizing that 'the path to prosperity is working together.' The conflict escalated after Ford imposed additional tariffs on electricity exports to U.S. states, prompting Trump to double tariffs on steel and aluminum. Canada had previously imposed retaliatory tariffs in April 2025 on U.S. goods, excluding certain auto manufacturers under 'remission quotas' that allow limited tariff-free vehicle imports. The dispute comes ahead of the 2026 review of the USMCA agreement, with daily trade between the two countries exceeding CAD 3.6 billion (USD 2.7 billion), and over 75% of Canada\u2019s exports going to the U.S. Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war has raised tariffs to their highest levels since the 1930s, threatening further increases and sparking concern among businesses and economists on both sides of the border. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that Canada 'will not allow the United States to gain unfair access to its markets' if negotiations fail, hinting at readiness for strong countermeasures.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 07:30 AM\nSource:[euronews](http://arabic.euronews.com/business/2025/10/24/reagan-declaration-sparks-trumps-anger-us-president-announces-end-of-trade-negotiation)\n\n**Trump Ends Trade Negotiations with Canada Over Anti-Tariff Ad Campaign**\nOn October 24, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that 'all commercial negotiations with Canada are over,' citing a Canadian advertising campaign that criticized U.S. tariffs as an 'unacceptable provocation.'

The Ontario government had previously aired an advertisement featuring a 1987 Ronald Reagan radio speech excerpt stating that 'tariffs are only effective in the short term... harming all American workers and consumers,' followed by a comment asserting that high tariffs inevitably lead to foreign retaliation and intense trade wars. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation later stated the ad distorted Reagan\u2019s original intent and that Ontario had not obtained authorization to use the material, and that legal action was being considered. Trump claimed the ad campaign was an attempt to sway the U.S. Supreme Court, which was scheduled to hear arguments on November 5 regarding the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s tariff policies. On August 29, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a prior ruling by the U.S. International Trade Court, finding that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not authorize the imposition of 'fentanyl tariffs' or 'reciprocal tariffs,' and that the administration had overstepped its authority. On September 3, the Trump administration formally appealed to the Supreme Court, urging emergency review, arguing that the ruling undermined five months of presidential effort and jeopardized ongoing negotiations and existing agreements. The reciprocal tariffs on Canada and Mexico had taken effect on March 4, 2025, prompting Ontario and other provinces to remove U.S. alcohol brands from shelves and sparking public boycotts of American goods and cancellations of travel to the U.S. The U.S. maintained tariffs at nearly century-old levels. A planned trade agreement between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Trump at the upcoming APEC summit was expected to cover steel, aluminum, and energy, and was seen by Trudeau as a constructive outcome. The termination of negotiations now forces Canada to pursue strategic shifts, including trade diversification, domestic investment, and immigration control. On October 22, 2025, Trudeau announced in a speech at the University of Ottawa that the upcoming fall budget would include plans to double exports to non-U.S. markets over the next decade, increase investment in major projects, and align immigration levels with national capacity. Canada\u2019s historically open immigration policy, especially post-pandemic, led to rapid growth in immigration\u2014particularly from India\u2014causing soaring housing prices and strained healthcare.

Trump claimed the ad was intended to interfere with U.S. Supreme Court and other judicial rulings. He reiterated that tariffs are vital to U.S. national security and economic interests. This follows Trump\u2019s April 2025 announcement of 'reciprocal tariffs' on many countries, which sparked widespread controversy. On May 28, 2025, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump lacked authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose such tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld this ruling on August 29, 2025, by a 7-4 vote, but delayed enforcement until October 14 to allow the Trump administration to appeal to the Supreme Court. Plaintiffs argued that IEEPA does not grant the president tariff authority and that no national emergency existed. They also contended that the tariffs violated the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 'substantial questions' doctrine. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that a negative Supreme Court ruling could require the government to repay up to $1 trillion in tariffs by June 2026, potentially causing catastrophic economic consequences and undermining existing and ongoing trade agreements. The U.S. Supreme Court announced on September 9, 2025, that it would fast-track review of the legality of most of Trump\u2019s tariffs, scheduling oral arguments for early November 2025. The tariffs in question include a 10% baseline tariff under IEEPA, higher tariffs on trade partners without agreements with the U.S., and so-called 'fentanyl tariffs.' According to The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, this will be the first major policy ruling by the Supreme Court after Trump\u2019s return to the White House, potentially determining the fate of tariffs\u2014a cornerstone of his economic agenda\u2014and reshaping U.S. and global trade. The decision also represents a critical test of Trump\u2019s expansion of executive power. If the final ruling is unfavorable, the administration could still impose tariffs under alternative trade laws, though this would require additional procedural steps and time. The Trump administration is reportedly already exploring other options.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 03:15 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8nhyqzAUHOX)\n\n**United States Implements New Border Restriction: Mexicans Failing to Meet Fee Requirement Will Be Denied Entry**\nSince September 30, 2025, new tariff changes have taken effect for foreign travelers entering the United States, particularly via land borders. These changes stem from HR-1, also known as 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' signed into law by former President Donald Trump in July 2025. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has made the new fees mandatory: travelers who fail to pay the updated charges will be denied entry at border checkpoints regardless of their travel purpose. The primary change affects Mexican travelers crossing by land, as the Form I-94 (Arrival and Departure Record) now includes an additional $6 fee, raising the total cost to $30. This increase applies only to those entering through land ports along the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada borders; air and sea travelers are exempt. The Form I-94 is required for most international visitors, except U.S. citizens, permanent residents returning home, immigrant visa holders, and most Canadian visitors on short stays. Mexican travelers are now facing an added financial barrier, and non-compliance with the fee will result in automatic denial of entry. Migration experts advise travelers to prepare in advance by identifying the correct documentation based on entry method and travel purpose, carrying proof of payment, and staying updated on potential future changes. The current U.S. administration has shown a trend toward stricter immigration policies, so travelers are encouraged to consult the official CBP website before planning any trips.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 08:43 PM\nSource:[El Cronista](https://www.cronista.com/mexico/actualidad-mx/estados-unidos-confirma-una-nueva-restriccion-en-frontera-los-mexicanos-que-no-cumplan-con-este-requisito-seran-vetados-del-pais-y-no-podran-ingresar/)\n\n**Trump Threatens 25% Tariffs on Mexico and Canada, Additional 10% on China**\nDonald Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada, stating that he will sign the necessary documents on January 20 to implement the measure.

He also stated that Mexico and Canada have the power to resolve the issue easily, but have not done so. Trump concluded by saying, 'It's time for them to pay a very high price!' Additionally, Trump announced that he will impose an additional 10% tariff on China, citing the large amounts of fentanyl being sent to the US through Mexico. He stated, 'We will charge China an additional 10% tariff, on top of any additional tariff, on all of their products that enter the United States of America, until they stop doing it.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 04:16 PM\nSource:[mundoejecutivo.com.mx](https://www.mundoejecutivo.com.mx/internacional/donald-trump-amenaza-a-mexico-y-a-canada-con-imponer-aranceles-del-25-si-no-detienen-la-migracion-en-sus-fronteras/)\n\n**Trump Signs Executive Order to Increase Tariffs on Canada to 35%**\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to increase tariffs on Canada from 25% to 35%. The higher tariffs will take effect on August 1, according to the White House. 'Canada has not cooperated to stop the current flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and has taken reprisals against the actions of the President of the United States to address this unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States,' the White House statement said. In response to Canada's 'continued inaction and reprisals,' Trump determined that it is necessary to increase the tariff on Canada to 'effectively address the existing emergency.' Goods eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will continue to be excluded from the new tariffs. Goods transshipped to evade the 35% tariff will be subject to a transshipment tariff of 40%. The White House described this presidential action as 'necessary and appropriate to protect American lives and national security and foreign policy of the United States.' Trump had previously signed an executive order in February imposing a 25% ad valorem tariff on imports from Canada as part of his response to the declared national emergency. In March, he determined that Canada had not adequately addressed the problem and proceeded with the imposition of the tariff, according to the White House. 'Now, President Trump takes new measures to hold Canada accountable for its continued role in the illicit drug crisis,' the White House said. This Thursday, Trump also announced the application of 'reciprocal tariffs' of up to 41% to numerous countries. In April, Canada imposed tariffs of 25% on US vehicles that did not meet USMCA standards, as well as on non-Canadian or Mexican components included in vehicles imported under that agreement, as a reprisal, reported its government. Canada was the largest buyer of US exports last year, with imports of $349 billion. In turn, it exported goods worth $413 billion to the US, making it its third-largest foreign supplier, according to US Department of Commerce data.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 08:54 AM\nSource:[\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51](http://spanish.people.com.cn/n3/2025/0801/c31618-20348310.html)\n\n**Trump signs order imposing new tariffs on a number of trading partners - Jersey Evening Post**\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing new tariffs on 68 countries and the 27-member European Union, effective August 7, 2025, as part of his broader trade agenda. The order establishes a baseline 10% tariff for countries not specifically listed, with rates varying based on trade imbalances and regional economic profiles. Specific rates include 15% for Lesotho (down from 50%), Taiwan (20%), Pakistan (19%), Israel, Iceland, Norway, Fiji, Ghana, Guyana, Ecuador, and several others; Switzerland faces a 39% tariff. Brazil\u2019s tariff was set at 10%, with the remaining 40% part of a separate measure approved earlier. The order capped off a high-pressure Thursday, with last-minute negotiations leading to agreements with South Korea, the EU, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Thailand\u2014particularly after the latter two agreed to a ceasefire. Mexico secured a 90-day negotiating period with the U.S., maintaining its current 25% tariff (down from 30%) and avoiding a planned increase, following a phone call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who described the outcome as a 'very successful' dialogue. Trump also raised the fentanyl-related tariff on Canada from 25% to 35%. The administration cited the need for harmonized rates and emphasized that tariffs would be borne by U.S. consumers and businesses, despite Trump\u2019s claim that the deals were 'excellent deals for the country.' No details were provided on the specific terms or nations involved in the new agreements. The move follows earlier tariff threats in April that triggered market panic and led to a 90-day negotiation extension. Global markets reacted with a rally following the announcement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 06:17 AM\nSource:[jerseyeveningpost.com](https://jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/worldnews/2025/08/01/trump-signs-order-imposing-new-tariffs-on-a-number-of-trading-partners/)\n\n**Mexico Seeks Agreement with US to Avoid Trade Dispute**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed confidence in reaching an agreement with the United States to avoid escalating the trade dispute over the new tariffs on Mexican imports, starting from August 1. Sheinbaum stated that her government is open to dialogue and believes that an agreement can be reached that protects the interests of both parties, preventing harm to the US and Mexican economies. Mexico is seeking a solution that takes into account the sensitivity of affected sectors. Mexico's exports to the US exceed $400 billion annually, making it one of Washington's largest commercial partners. US President Donald Trump had previously announced on the 'Truth Social' platform that goods from the EU and Mexico would face a 30% US tariff starting from August 1. Trump has taken several decisions on tariffs since taking office on January 20, which have shocked financial markets and created uncertainty in the global economy. Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Mexican imports and most Canadian imports on February 1, and a 10% tariff on goods from China, which demanded that it prevent the flow of synthetic fentanyl and unauthorized immigration to the US. On February 3, Trump suspended the tariffs he threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada, and agreed to delay their implementation for 30 days in exchange for easing enforcement procedures related to borders and crime. The US did not reach a similar agreement with China. On February 7, Trump delayed the tariffs on low-cost imports from China until the US Department of Commerce could confirm the implementation of the necessary procedures and regulations to deal with them and collect tariffs. On February 10, Trump increased the tariffs on steel and aluminum to 25%, and kept them unchanged 'without exceptions or exemptions.' On March 3, Trump said that a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada would take effect on March 4, and doubled the tariffs related to fentanyl on all Chinese imports to 20%. On March 5, Trump agreed to delay the tariffs for a month on some Canadian and Mexican manufactured vehicles after speaking with the CEOs of global companies.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 13, 2025 06:59 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0639\u0643\u0627\u0638](https://www.okaz.com.sa/economy/international/2204333)\n\n**US Evaluates Not Applying 35% Tariffs to Canadian Goods Under USMCA**\nThe US government is evaluating not applying the 35% tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump to Canadian goods subject to the USMCA trade agreement, which also includes Mexico. A White House official confirmed to EFE that only products subject to a 25% tariff since March would be subject to a 35% tariff. This means that goods included in the USMCA would be exempt, as well as Canadian products currently subject to a 10% tariff, such as energy and potassium, said the official, who emphasized that 'no final document has been drafted' and that Trump has not made a 'definitive decision.' Trump had threatened to impose a 35% tariff on Canada starting August 1, arguing that he could consider a change if the country removes trade barriers and Ottawa contributes to stopping the flow of fentanyl into the US. However, the amounts of this drug seized at the border between the two countries are 'testimonial.' This apparent plan, as reported by CBC, sheds light on Trump's strategies with USMCA partners at a time when Mexico is seeking to negotiate with the US a global agreement proposed by President Claudia Sheinbaum to the Republican during the recent G-7 summit. The agreement would cover security, migration, and trade, without affecting the USMCA, which is subject to review this year. A Mexican delegation will travel to the US on Friday to address the proposal.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 12, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/13460380/07/25/trump-evalua-no-gravar-con-aranceles-del-35-a-los-bienes-sujetos-al-tmec.html)\n\n**Trump Imposes 35% Tariff on Canadian Imports, Threatens Other Trading Partners**\nUS President Donald Trump announced on Friday that the US will impose a 35% tariff on Canadian imports starting August 1, and threatened to impose a 15% or 20% tariff on most of its other trading partners. Trump sent a message to Canada late on Thursday, after a meeting where he warned the EU that he would announce the tariffs 'today or tomorrow'. Countries that do not receive a message from Trump will face higher tariffs than those that have agreed to a 'reciprocal' agreement of 10%. Trump said in an interview with NBC News: 'We will say that all remaining countries will pay, whether it's 20% or 15%, we will settle it now.' In a message posted on a social media platform, Trump informed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the new price will take effect on August 1, and will be raised if Canada takes retaliatory measures, according to The Guardian. Trudeau wrote on social media that his government will continue to defend Canadian workers and businesses in negotiations with the US in the context of seeking this revised deadline. He said in a post on X: 'Throughout the current trade negotiations with the US, the Canadian government has consistently defended our workers and businesses. We will continue to do so in the context of our efforts to reach the revised deadline of August 1.' Fentanyl enters the trade line. In his message to Trudeau, Trump also complained about what he called the flow of fentanyl from Canada, and wrote: 'If Canada cooperates with me to stop the flow of fentanyl, we may consider revising this message.' Canadian officials say that a small amount of fentanyl entering the US comes from Canada. Trudeau reminded Trump of Canada's role in the fight to reduce the amount of strong opioids coming to North America. Trudeau said: 'Canada has made significant progress in stopping the fentanyl epidemic in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the US to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.' Former officials in the US government have warned that Trump's trade policies may make the US more vulnerable to the trade of deadly synthetic opioids from abroad. Gradual escalation of tariffs on Canada. A US official said it is 'likely' that the tariffs on goods covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) of 2020 will be removed, but 'no final decisions have been made.' This exclusion would greatly reduce the impact of Trump's tariff increase on Canada. In March, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars and car parts from Canada. In June, he announced a 50% tariff on Canadian imports of steel and aluminum, and the new rate will apply to all other goods. Canada and the US have been engaged in trade talks in the hope of reaching an agreement, but it appears that this latest threat has put this deadline at risk. This latest message was one of more than 20 similar messages Trump has sent since Monday, as he continues to threaten to launch a trade war against dozens of economies.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 02:22 PM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5136584)\n\n**Trump Announces 35% Tariff on Canada, Threatening Trade Agreement**\nUS President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canadian exports to the US starting August 1, 2025, in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. This is the latest in a series of over 20 tariff notifications sent by Trump to US trading partners since Monday, rekindling his trade war against dozens of economies. 'Instead of collaborating with the US, Canada retaliated with its own tariffs. Starting August 1, 2025, we will charge Canada a 35% tax on Canadian products sent to the US, in addition to all sectoral tariffs,' Trump said in the letter, published on his Truth Social platform. Ottawa and Washington are negotiating to reach a trade agreement before July 21, but this latest threat may put that deadline at risk. Canada and Mexico are seeking ways to satisfy Trump to revive the USMCA trade agreement, which unites the three North American countries. This agreement replaced the previous NAFTA pact in July 2020, after Trump imposed a renegotiation during his first term (2017-2021). A review of the agreement was scheduled for July 2026, but Trump accelerated the process by launching his trade war upon his return to the White House in January. Canadian and Mexican products were initially affected by US tariffs of 25%, with a lower rate for Canadian energy production. Trump criticized his two neighbors, alleging they were not doing enough to combat irregular immigration and the flow of illicit drugs, including fentanyl. However, he later announced exemptions for products entering the US under the USMCA, which covers a wide range of goods. Trump's letter to Carney came despite an improvement in relations between the two leaders, who met at the White House on May 6 and again at the G7 summit in Canada last month.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 01:55 AM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**Could Trump's tariffs lead to trade rerouting? - Investment Monitor**\nOn 31 January, US President Donald Trump signed executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. Following negotiations, a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports took effect on 4 February, while 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods were delayed for one month. Mexico agreed to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to its U.S. border to combat drug trafficking, and in return, the U.S. pledged to strengthen efforts to prevent gun trafficking into Mexico\u2014though Trump did not acknowledge this commitment publicly. Canada announced the appointment of a 'fentanyl czar', the listing of Mexican cartels as terrorist groups, a Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force to fight organized crime and money laundering, and a $869 million border security plan. China, which did not secure a last-minute deal, faced the 10% tariff, a far cry from the 60% promised during Trump\u2019s campaign. In response, China announced retaliatory measures set to take effect on 10 February, including a 15% levy on under $5 billion in U.S. energy imports, a 10% charge on oil and agricultural equipment, and a probe into Google\u2019s alleged antitrust practices\u2014despite Google not operating in China since 2010. Natixis Asia-Pacific chief economist Alicia-Garcia Herrero noted China\u2019s goal is to 'save face' and signal it can negotiate like Canada and Mexico, while avoiding full-scale trade war escalation. Experts like Stephen Buzdugan warn that tariffs could raise input costs, reduce overseas markets, and increase consumer prices\u2014similar to post-Brexit UK. The tariffs may also influence foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, prompting companies to adopt dual strategies for supply chain diversification and risk mitigation. Analysts suggest that even without full tariff implementation, policy uncertainty is accelerating nearshoring and trade rerouting trends, particularly through intermediaries like Singapore. Trump\u2019s focus on supply chain security and fentanyl concerns signals potential future scrutiny of trade circumvention, though current actions remain relatively moderate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[investmentmonitor.ai](https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/features/could-trumps-tariffs-lead-to-trade-rerouting/)\n\n**Trump places tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China**\nOn February 2, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China, effective Tuesday. The White House cited an 'unprecedented invasion' of illegal fentanyl and immigrants as justification, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act due to a 'national emergency.' Canada will face a 25% tariff on most goods and a 10% tariff on crude oil imports, while Mexico\u2019s energy imports are included in its 25% rate. The U.S. also canceled the 'de minimis' exemption for Canadian shipments under $800. China\u2019s 10% tariff applies on top of existing tariffs. Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum announced retaliatory tariffs, including nontariff measures, and rejected claims of government ties to criminal organizations, accusing the U.S. of failing to address domestic drug sales and money laundering. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed retaliatory 25% tariffs on $155 billion in U.S. goods, with $30 billion effective immediately and $125 billion in 21 days, and signaled potential non-tariff actions on critical minerals and energy. China denounced the move, stating it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take 'corresponding countermeasures' to protect its interests, while urging dialogue. Economists, including Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations, warned the tariffs would impose a 'tax hike' on U.S. imports and 'have an immediate and negative impact on the U.S. economy,' potentially shrinking GDP. Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute criticized the tariffs as unjustified, noting that Canada is not among the top five U.S. trade deficit partners and that fentanyl shipments across Canada are minimal. He argued tariffs do not stop illegal immigration and may even incentivize it by threatening Mexican jobs. Trump claimed tariffs would boost domestic manufacturing and called them 'a great source of leverage,' despite acknowledging short-term consumer disruption. He previously negotiated the USMCA in 2018, which he praised as 'the fairest' trade deal, but the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico rose from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, and with Canada from $31 billion to $72 billion.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts place the probability of the US Congress passing a bill implementing Trump's tariff policies (specifically, a 10% or greater across-the-board tariff on nearly all imports) in 2025 at a very low level\u2014ranging from 3% to 10%, with most clustering between 3% and 8%. Across diverse perspectives\u2014spanning US legislative process, trade policy, political science theories, economic interest group analysis, and agenda setting\u2014the consensus is that the structural, political, and procedural barriers to passage are extremely high.\n\nKey reasons for the low probabilities include:\n- Congressional action is historically rare for broad tariffs; since WWII, such measures have always been taken by executive order rather than through new, sweeping legislation.\n- Intense opposition from powerful business, retail, agricultural, and export sector lobbies, who are already mobilized against the tariffs due to fears of economic harm and retaliation.\n- Divisions within the Republican Party, resistance from moderate or business-aligned Republicans, and near-universal Democratic opposition.\n- The default Congressional response to controversial, high-salience economic shocks is inertia or delay, letting the executive branch own fallout and avoiding legislative responsibility for consumer price increases.\n- Ongoing legal challenges and a pending Supreme Court review have not yet forced Congress\u2019s hand. Passage of a bill is seen as possible only in the unlikely event that a court decision fully strips Trump of tariff-imposing authority and creates a genuine legislative crisis\u2014with a unified GOP and extraordinary party discipline.\n- News and reporting as of late October 2025 show Trump escalating tariffs via executive orders and rhetoric, but there is no evidence of a legislative push for an across-the-board tariff bill moving through Congress.\n\nTypical 'No' scenarios involve continued executive action on tariffs, legal battles, industry lobbying, and Congressional avoidance or gridlock. The only plausible 'Yes' scenario is a legal or economic emergency forcing Congress's hand, but even then, formidable obstacles persist, and rapid passage is highly improbable given the short remaining timeline.\n\nIn sum, the overwhelming expert consensus is that Congress is highly unlikely to pass a bill implementing Trump\u2019s proposed across-the-board tariffs in 2025. Final assigned probabilities are uniformly low, with a median near 5% and no expert exceeding 10%.",
