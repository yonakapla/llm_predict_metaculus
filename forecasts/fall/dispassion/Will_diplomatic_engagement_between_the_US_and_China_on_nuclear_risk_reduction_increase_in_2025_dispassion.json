Recent news indicates that both sides, under pressure from escalating nuclear risks and global scrutiny, are at least testing renewed military communications. China's defense minister has signaled some openness to concrete de-escalation steps (albeit with conditions), and the U.S. congressional delegation\u2019s visit suggests exploratory groundwork is being laid. Although high-level, binding progress remains unlikely, the likelihood of at least one meeting or semi-official dialogue being acknowledged before year's end is moderately high, especially as crisis management is in both sides' interests. However, Chinese caution and the risk of renewed crisis over Taiwan could still scuttle engagement. On balance, I judge there is a significant chance (>50%) that the minimum threshold for 'increased diplomatic engagement'\u2014as defined by the question\u2014will be met in 2025, but not so high as to warrant an extreme prediction due to persistent risks.",

However, several factors nudge the probability upward: the nuclear arms race is accelerating, expert and allied pressure for at least minimal engagement is high, and there are credible signs (e.g., the September 2025 congressional delegation to Beijing) that channels are cautiously reopening. The resolution criteria set a low bar: a single acknowledged Track 1.5/2 dialogue or official working group, if it occurs and is focused on nuclear risk reduction, is enough. Even if the engagement is perfunctory or symbolic, as long as it exceeds the minimal contacts of 2024, it qualifies. Given these considerations\u2014and the tendency for both sides to use low-level engagement as a safety valve during tense periods\u2014I judge a modest increase in engagement to be somewhat more likely than not, but not overwhelmingly so.

Recent news of a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation to Beijing, with signals from the Chinese defense minister about de-escalation steps, and the global salience of nuclear risk (Doomsday Clock, rising arsenals) make at least a low-level, acknowledged engagement plausible. Even if deep progress is unlikely, the most probable scenario is a minimal, symbolic, or technical dialogue that both sides acknowledge, which would resolve the question Yes.

The September 2025 congressional delegation to Beijing and the Chinese defense minister's non-confrontational remarks suggest at least a willingness to consider such gestures, especially under mounting international and expert pressure. Historically, even adversaries have occasionally resorted to minimal CBMs during periods of heightened risk for optics, signaling, or genuine risk management. Thus, the risk is not that significant, meaningful progress is required, but that even a single, acknowledged dialogue on nuclear risk reduction (however shallow) would suffice for a Yes. Your reasoning seems to conflate the likelihood of deep engagement with the much lower bar of the question, leading to an underweighting of the probability of a qualifying event.

The most likely scenario remains a minimal, symbolic, but officially acknowledged engagement\u2014such as a Track 1.5 or technical dialogue\u2014that meets the low threshold for question resolution.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n[U.S.-China nuclear relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have become an increasing point of concern for global security. China is rapidly [expanding its nuclear arsenal](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2025-03/chinese-nuclear-weapons-2025/), with [projections](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2025-01/news/pentagon-says-chinese-nuclear-arsenal-still-growing) that it will have 1,000 warheads by 2030. Meanwhile, the U.S. has signaled growing concern over strategic stability with China, given the absence of arms control agreements similar to those that exist with Russia.\n\nHistorically, diplomatic engagement on [nuclear risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_relations#Nuclear_security) between the U.S. and China has been limited, as China has been reluctant to participate in formal arms control negotiations, citing its much smaller nuclear arsenal compared to the U.S. and Russia. However, there have been some modest signs of progress, recently. \u0399n [November 2023](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-china-hold-first-informal-nuclear-talks-5-years-eyeing-taiwan-2024-06-21/), U.S. and Chinese officials held their first formal nuclear risk reduction talks in over four years.\n\nThat said, several challenges remain:\n\n* **Taiwan tensions**: Any escalation in the Taiwan Strait could derail diplomatic efforts.\n* **Chinese skepticism**: Beijing has long viewed U.S. calls for nuclear dialogue as an attempt to constrain its strategic capabilities.\n* **U.S. political uncertainty**: The return of Donald Trump to the presidency in 2025 has raised questions about continuity in diplomatic efforts.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36024,\"question_id\":35458}}`",

The Kremlin described Trump's comment as 'an optimistic signal' amid global atomic fears. Putin had previously offered to voluntarily delay the expiration of New START, which has been in effect since 2011 and limits both nations\u2014responsible for 87% of the world\u2019s nuclear arsenal\u2014to 1,550 strategic warheads on 700 delivery systems. The proposed extension would maintain current terms while negotiations for a new treaty proceed, potentially including China, Russia\u2019s ally, and possibly France and the UK, the Western partners. Trump had previously abandoned two earlier arms control agreements during his first term, citing obsolescence. Putin suspended Russia\u2019s obligations under New START in 2023 due to U.S. support for Ukraine, though he maintained the warhead and delivery system limits while freezing mutual inspection regimes. The treaty governs strategic weapons capable of destroying entire cities; tactical nuclear weapons, though less powerful and intended for battlefield use, are widely considered by experts to escalate rapidly to strategic use. The U.S. possesses about 200 tactical warheads, 100 operational, while Russia has 1,558. Both nations have advanced nuclear capabilities: Trump\u2019s administration lowered thresholds for tactical nuclear use and deployed non-strategic weapons on submarines; Putin has revised Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine to expand the conditions for nuclear use and tested new hypersonic missiles like the Oreshnik, which flew over Ukraine in November 2024 without a warhead. Meanwhile, the U.S. is considering sending Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, but Trump stated he wants to know Kyiv\u2019s plans before deciding, saying, 'I kind of already made a decision. I think I want to know what they want to do with them. I don\u2019t want to escalate the war.' Putin warned that supplying such weapons would lead to a decisive breakdown in U.S.-Russia relations, which he still considers a priority. Washington reports suggest Trump may not make a firm decision, but the outcome remains uncertain. On the battlefield, Ukraine launched its second-largest drone attack on Russia on October 6, 2025, with Russia claiming to have shot down 251 drones. The previous attack, on March 11, 2025, involved 337 drones. The strikes targeted southern Russia, including Belgorod, where power stations were hit and 40,000 people were left without electricity in a region of 1.5 million. In Crimea, annexed in 2014, attacks hit a petroleum distribution terminal and a munitions factory. Explosions were also reported in Briansk and Nizhny Novgorod, with local Telegram channels sharing images, though no casualties were confirmed.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:02 PM\nSource:[Portal do Holanda](https://www.portaldoholanda.com.br/mundo/trump-diz-que-proposta-nuclear-de-putin-parece-uma-boa-ideia-0)\n\n**Does the U.S.-China Nuclear Arms Race Bring Strategic Stability? Hudson Institute's 'Beyond Nuclear Balance' (Part 2)**\nA report by the U.S.-based think tank Hudson Institute, titled 'Beyond Nuclear Balance: Strategic Force Network Assessment,' published in February 2025, argues that the emerging nuclear arms race between the United States and China could lead to a stable strategic environment by 2040. Although China's current nuclear arsenal remains far behind those of the U.S. and Russia\u2014accounting for only about 10% of the global deployed nuclear warheads, compared to 89% held by the U.S. and Russia combined\u2014China is rapidly expanding its nuclear capabilities. The U.S. Department of Defense estimates that China\u2019s operational nuclear warheads could exceed 1,000 by 2030, approaching the 1,550 limit set by the New START treaty between the U.S. and Russia. This shift would transition the global nuclear order from a U.S.-Russia bipolar system to a tripartite U.S.-China-Russia structure. According to Andrew Krepinevich, senior fellow at Hudson Institute, this three-way balance complicates the maintenance of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), a strategic deterrence principle that has historically prevented nuclear escalation between the U.S. and Russia. The report suggests that the new triad may, paradoxically, create a more stable strategic environment by introducing a new equilibrium, despite the increased complexity. China\u2019s military parade on September 3, 2024, during the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japan, marked the first public display of its land, sea, and air-based nuclear delivery systems, signaling its intent to be recognized as a nuclear superpower on par with the U.S. and Russia.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 10:26 PM\nSource:[\u7523\u7d4c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://www.sankei.com/article/20251007-3CF77GP22ZICRMXFGBBVNY6BA4/)\n\n**Lai Qingde: If Trump Ensures Xi Abandons Taiwan Military Attacks, He Deserves Nobel Peace Prize**\nTaiwan's President Lai Qingde, in a live interview on the U.S. radio program 'The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show' aired on October 7, 2025, emphasized Taiwan's commitment to peace and self-defense amid escalating cross-strait tensions. He stated that as long as there is mutual respect and dignity, Taiwan is open to negotiations with China to achieve peaceful coexistence. Lai referenced former U.S. President Donald Trump's claim that Xi Jinping had personally assured him during Trump\u2019s term that China would not launch a military attack on Taiwan. Lai remarked that if Trump could secure a permanent abandonment of such military threats by Xi, Trump would undoubtedly deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. Lai outlined Taiwan\u2019s 'Four Pillars of Peace' strategy: strengthening defense, increasing defense spending to 3.32% of GDP next year and aiming for 5% by 2030\u2014exceeding NATO\u2019s standard by five years; enhancing economic resilience by reducing reliance on China and increasing investment in the U.S.; aligning with the U.S. and democratic allies to deter aggression; and maintaining openness to dialogue with China on equal and dignified terms. He warned that China\u2019s military activities now span the Indo-Pacific, including large-scale exercises in the East and South China Seas, carrier deployments beyond the First and Second Island Chains, and missile tests near Australia. Lai stressed that Taiwan\u2019s defense is not only about sovereignty but also about safeguarding global peace, and that Taiwan\u2019s efforts are part of a broader alliance strategy. He also announced the establishment of the 'Whole-Society Defense Resilience Committee' and the formal designation of the Chinese Communist Party as an 'external hostile force,' with 17 countermeasures and over 100 legal reforms to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Lai concluded by asserting that self-reliance is essential to gaining international support, and only through collective action can peace and stability be achieved.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 05:58 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E8%8B%A5%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE-%E8%83%BD%E8%AE%93%E7%BF%92%E8%BF%91%E5%B9%B3%E6%B0%B8%E9%81%A0%E6%94%BE%E6%A3%84%E5%B0%8D%E5%8F%B0%E6%AD%A6%E5%8A%9B%E6%94%BB%E6%93%8A-%E8%B3%B4%E6%B8%85%E5%BE%B7-%E5%BF%85%E7%84%B6%E5%BE%97%E8%AB%BE%E8%B2%9D%E7%88%BE%E7%8D%8E-015800909.html)\n\n**Trump Says Putin's Nuclear Proposal 'Seems Like a Good Idea' Amid Escalating Tensions**\nIn the context of renewed tensions with Russia over the war in Ukraine, former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to extend the New START nuclear arms control treaty by one year 'seems like a good idea.' Trump made the comment to reporters leaving the White House on Sunday, October 5, 2025, and the Kremlin described it as 'an optimistic signal' amid global atomic fears. Putin had previously proposed voluntarily delaying the expiration of New START, the last remaining arms control agreement in force since 2011, to allow time for negotiations on a new treaty that may include China, Russia\u2019s ally, and possibly France and the UK.

They argue that the U.S. must develop 'more, different, and better' nuclear capabilities and advanced missile defense to enable 'damage limitation' strategies\u2014destroying adversary warheads before or after launch. This approach, however, promotes a war-fighting doctrine that embraces the possibility of nuclear first use and escalation, contradicting long-standing principles of deterrence through assured destruction. The article, authored by Joe Cirincione and published in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, counters that the U.S. already possesses over 5,177 nuclear warheads (including deployed, reserve, and retired but intact ones), making its force three times larger than China\u2019s projected 1,500 by 2035. The author argues that the real threat is not China\u2019s size but the dangerous shift toward nuclear war-fighting, which undermines global stability. The article criticizes the authors for ignoring successful past diplomacy, the impact of U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, and the role of political instability\u2014particularly Donald Trump\u2019s erratic policies\u2014in eroding allied confidence, which is not solved by more weapons. The piece warns that this 'new Washington consensus' is now dominant across parties, backed by a powerful nuclear lobby and massive budgets, and calls for urgent, persistent pushback to prevent irreversible escalation. The article concludes with a quote from Martin Perlmutter, calling the argument 'crackpot realism' and noting that nuclear weapons are increasingly the tools of the weak.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 07:41 PM\nSource:[thebulletin.org](https://thebulletin.org/2025/09/the-dangerous-new-washington-consensus-for-more-nuclear-weapons/)\n\n**Ex-Australian PM warns Taiwan's fall would shake global order | Taiwan News | Oct. 8, 2025 16:57**\nFormer Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned at the Taipei Security Dialogue on October 8, 2025, that if Taiwan were brought under Chinese control, 'no place in the world could remain untouched,' emphasizing that safeguarding the status quo is vital for regional peace and the broader free and open order in the Indo-Pacific. Speaking at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, Morrison stated that a Chinese takeover would allow the People's Liberation Army to build air bases in Taiwan, deploy long-range missiles, and extend its defensive perimeter to the second island chain, fundamentally upending regional balance and forcing neighboring countries under Beijing's dominance. He cited the military and strategic risks of such a shift, urging Taiwan to deepen security cooperation with the US, Japan, and Australia, while strengthening both military and civilian infrastructure through accelerated domestic defense production, energy diversification\u2014including possible nuclear restarts and expanded LNG supply options\u2014and enhanced space resilience via backup satellite constellations, anti-jamming systems, mobile ground stations, and anti-satellite defenses. Morrison acknowledged Taiwan\u2019s progress in indigenous missile development, layered coastal defenses, and integration of unmanned systems, advocating for continued prioritization of an asymmetric defense strategy. He stressed that deterrence involves not only military hardware but also public messaging and diplomacy, drawing a parallel between Taiwan\u2019s current position and West Berlin during the Cold War, where resilience and resolve served as a form of defense.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 09:07 AM\nSource:[Taiwan News](https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6216023)\n\n**Foreign Media Focus on Lai Qingde's Call to Trump: 'If Xi Abandons Attack on Taiwan, Trump Deserves Nobel Peace Prize'**\nTaiwan's President Lai Qingde, during an interview on the U.S. conservative radio show 'Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show' aired on Tuesday, urged U.S. President Donald Trump to continue supporting Taiwan. Lai stated that if Trump could convince Chinese President Xi Jinping to permanently abandon the use of force against Taiwan, Trump would undoubtedly be a Nobel Peace Prize recipient. Media outlets including Bloomberg, Reuters, the UK's Independent, NBC, Japan's Asahi Shimbun, and Kyodo News reported on this statement. Bloomberg noted that Lai's choice to speak on a conservative U.S. platform underscores Taiwan's diplomatic isolation. Although the U.S. remains Taiwan's most steadfast ally, the Trump administration has recently sought to improve relations with China and has shown skepticism toward foreign entanglements. NBC cited Reuters, noting that while the U.S. and China do not have formal diplomatic ties over Taiwan, the U.S. remains Taiwan\u2019s most important international backer. However, since Trump\u2019s return to office in January 2025, no new U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have been announced. Trump is expected to meet Xi Jinping during the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea later this month. Lai referenced Trump\u2019s August remarks, in which Trump claimed Xi told him personally that China would not attack Taiwan during Trump\u2019s presidency. Lai emphasized that continued U.S. support is vital, warning that if Taiwan were to be annexed, China would gain greater power to challenge U.S. global influence and undermine the rules-based international order, ultimately threatening American interests. He urged Trump to remain vigilant regarding China\u2019s increasing military activities in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, South China Sea, and even in Australia\u2019s economic zone, where live-fire drills have been conducted. Lai affirmed Taiwan\u2019s resolve to defend its national security and its commitment to working with democratic allies to maintain regional stability. The Anadolu Agency reported on the interview under the headline 'Peace is priceless: Taiwan leader calls on China to abandon force.' Reuters noted that while U.S. law mandates providing Taiwan with self-defense capabilities, Washington has long adhered to a 'strategic ambiguity' policy, refraining from explicitly stating whether it would respond militarily to a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Taiwan and the U.S. do not have formal diplomatic relations, and their leaders have no direct meeting opportunities. Nonetheless, Lai said that if given the chance to speak directly with Trump, he would stress the importance of understanding China\u2019s expanding military posture and its threat to peace in the Indo-Pacific region. The Nobel Peace Prize for 2025 was announced on Friday, October 10, 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20251008001811-260408)\n\n**Time for talks, not threats**\nThe article criticizes recent provocative statements by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and top military officials, including General Upendra Dwivedi, who warned Pakistan of severe consequences if it continues state-sponsored terrorism, threatening to 'rethink whether it wants a place in history and geography.' These remarks come amid heightened tensions following a May 7, 2025, war that nearly led to a nuclear conflict in South Asia. Pakistan\u2019s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif dismissed Indian statements as a 'failed attempt' to restore credibility after a decisive 0-6 defeat in the May clash. The article argues that India stands diplomatically isolated: it faces a trade war with the US under President Donald Trump, who has imposed visa restrictions and pressured India to stop purchasing Russian oil and gas. Despite India\u2019s historical ties with Russia and recent overtures to China, both powers are reluctant to support India due to geopolitical constraints. The US, Russia, and China all have strategic reasons to avoid escalating the situation. The article concludes that India\u2019s aggressive rhetoric is counterproductive, given the widely held perception that India was weakened during the May conflict. It calls for diplomatic negotiations, especially on Kashmir, to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, emphasizing that even the UK\u2014historically responsible for massive colonial harm\u2014was reconciled with India, making coexistence with Pakistan feasible.

This effort aligns with Washington\u2019s broader goal of pressuring Russia over its war in Ukraine by cutting off energy revenue, a strategy already applied successfully in Europe. However, India remains cautious due to longstanding strategic ties with Russia, including a 2021 agreement for Rosneft to supply nearly 15 million barrels of crude to Indian Oil, and a 2018 S-400 missile deal now being implemented. India also participated in Russia-led 'Zapad' military drills in September 2024, which included tactical nuclear weapon rehearsals, and is part of a 20-year strategic cooperation treaty with Russia, expanded in January 2024. The U.S. aims to leverage India\u2019s strategic concerns over China\u2014especially after the 2020 Galwan Valley clash\u2014to position India as a counterbalance to Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). To support this, the U.S. has proposed the 'U.S.-India COMPACT' to boost defense co-production, expand trade to $500 billion by 2030, and supply energy alternatives via the UAE and American exports. Despite these efforts, India\u2019s continued energy imports from Russia and deep defense cooperation with Moscow indicate that Washington\u2019s push for alignment faces significant challenges, particularly given India\u2019s long-standing, non-threatening relationship with Russia and its growing energy demands\u2014projected to make India the world\u2019s third-largest energy consumer by 2030, according to the IEA.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/After-Tariffs-Trump-Courts-India-With-Energy-and-Defense-Deals.html)\n\n**Trump Says Putin\u2019s Nuclear Proposal 'Seems Like a Good Idea' Amid Escalating Tensions**\nDonald Trump stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to extend the New START nuclear arms control treaty by one year 'seems like a good idea,' according to a statement made to reporters exiting the White House on Sunday, October 5, 2025. The Kremlin described Trump's comment as 'an optimistic signal' amid global atomic fears. Putin had previously offered to voluntarily delay the expiration of New START, which has been in effect since 2011 and limits both nations\u2014responsible for 87% of the world\u2019s nuclear arsenal\u2014to 1,550 strategic warheads on 700 delivery systems. The proposed extension would maintain current terms while negotiations for a new treaty proceed, potentially including China, Russia\u2019s ally, and possibly France and the UK, the Western partners. Trump had previously abandoned two earlier arms control agreements during his first term, citing obsolescence. Putin suspended Russia\u2019s obligations under New START in 2023 due to U.S. support for Ukraine, though he maintained the warhead and delivery system limits while freezing mutual inspection regimes. The treaty governs strategic weapons capable of destroying entire cities; tactical nuclear weapons, though less powerful and intended for battlefield use, are widely considered by experts to escalate rapidly to strategic use. The U.S. possesses about 200 tactical warheads, 100 operational, while Russia has 1,558. Both nations have advanced nuclear capabilities: Trump\u2019s administration lowered thresholds for tactical nuclear use and deployed non-strategic weapons on submarines; Putin has revised Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine to expand the conditions for nuclear use and tested new hypersonic missiles like the Oreshnik, which flew over Ukraine in November 2024 without a warhead. Meanwhile, the U.S. is considering sending Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, but Trump stated he wants to know Kyiv\u2019s plans before deciding, saying, 'I kind of already made a decision. I think I want to know what they want to do with them. I don\u2019t want to escalate the war.' Putin warned that supplying such weapons would lead to a decisive breakdown in U.S.-Russia relations, which he still considers a priority. Washington reports suggest Trump may not make a firm decision, but the outcome remains uncertain. On the battlefield, Ukraine launched its second-largest drone attack on Russia on October 6, 2025, with Russia claiming to have shot down 251 drones. The previous attack, on March 11, 2025, involved 337 drones. The strikes targeted southern Russia, including Belgorod, where power stations were hit and 40,000 people were left without electricity in a region of 1.5 million. In Crimea, annexed in 2014, attacks hit a petroleum distribution terminal and a munitions factory. Explosions were also reported in Briansk and Nizhny Novgorod, with local Telegram channels sharing images, though no casualties were confirmed.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:02 PM\nSource:[Portal do Holanda](https://www.portaldoholanda.com.br/mundo/trump-diz-que-proposta-nuclear-de-putin-parece-uma-boa-ideia-0)\n\n**Does the U.S.-China Nuclear Arms Race Bring Strategic Stability? Hudson Institute's 'Beyond Nuclear Balance' (Part 2)**\nA report by the U.S.-based think tank Hudson Institute, titled 'Beyond Nuclear Balance: Strategic Force Network Assessment,' published in February 2025, argues that the emerging nuclear arms race between the United States and China could lead to a stable strategic environment by 2040. Although China's current nuclear arsenal remains far behind those of the U.S. and Russia\u2014accounting for only about 10% of the global deployed nuclear warheads, compared to 89% held by the U.S. and Russia combined\u2014China is rapidly expanding its nuclear capabilities. The U.S. Department of Defense estimates that China\u2019s operational nuclear warheads could exceed 1,000 by 2030, approaching the 1,550 limit set by the New START treaty between the U.S. and Russia. This shift would transition the global nuclear order from a U.S.-Russia bipolar system to a tripartite U.S.-China-Russia structure. According to Andrew Krepinevich, senior fellow at Hudson Institute, this three-way balance complicates the maintenance of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), a strategic deterrence principle that has historically prevented nuclear escalation between the U.S. and Russia. The report suggests that the new triad may, paradoxically, create a more stable strategic environment by introducing a new equilibrium, despite the increased complexity. China\u2019s military parade on September 3, 2024, during the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japan, marked the first public display of its land, sea, and air-based nuclear delivery systems, signaling its intent to be recognized as a nuclear superpower on par with the U.S. and Russia.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 10:26 PM\nSource:[\u7523\u7d4c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://www.sankei.com/article/20251007-3CF77GP22ZICRMXFGBBVNY6BA4/)\n\n**Lai Qingde: If Trump Ensures Xi Abandons Taiwan Military Attacks, He Deserves Nobel Peace Prize**\nTaiwan's President Lai Qingde, in a live interview on the U.S. radio program 'The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show' aired on October 7, 2025, emphasized Taiwan's commitment to peace and self-defense amid escalating cross-strait tensions. He stated that as long as there is mutual respect and dignity, Taiwan is open to negotiations with China to achieve peaceful coexistence. Lai referenced former U.S. President Donald Trump's claim that Xi Jinping had personally assured him during Trump\u2019s term that China would not launch a military attack on Taiwan. Lai remarked that if Trump could secure a permanent abandonment of such military threats by Xi, Trump would undoubtedly deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. Lai outlined Taiwan\u2019s 'Four Pillars of Peace' strategy: strengthening defense, increasing defense spending to 3.32% of GDP next year and aiming for 5% by 2030\u2014exceeding NATO\u2019s standard by five years; enhancing economic resilience by reducing reliance on China and increasing investment in the U.S.; aligning with the U.S. and democratic allies to deter aggression; and maintaining openness to dialogue with China on equal and dignified terms. He warned that China\u2019s military activities now span the Indo-Pacific, including large-scale exercises in the East and South China Seas, carrier deployments beyond the First and Second Island Chains, and missile tests near Australia. Lai stressed that Taiwan\u2019s defense is not only about sovereignty but also about safeguarding global peace, and that Taiwan\u2019s efforts are part of a broader alliance strategy. He also announced the establishment of the 'Whole-Society Defense Resilience Committee' and the formal designation of the Chinese Communist Party as an 'external hostile force,' with 17 countermeasures and over 100 legal reforms to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Lai concluded by asserting that self-reliance is essential to gaining international support, and only through collective action can peace and stability be achieved.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 05:58 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E8%8B%A5%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE-%E8%83%BD%E8%AE%93%E7%BF%92%E8%BF%91%E5%B9%B3%E6%B0%B8%E9%81%A0%E6%94%BE%E6%A3%84%E5%B0%8D%E5%8F%B0%E6%AD%A6%E5%8A%9B%E6%94%BB%E6%93%8A-%E8%B3%B4%E6%B8%85%E5%BE%B7-%E5%BF%85%E7%84%B6%E5%BE%97%E8%AB%BE%E8%B2%9D%E7%88%BE%E7%8D%8E-015800909.html)\n\n**Trump Welcomes Putin\u2019s Proposal to Extend New START Nuclear Arms Treaty**\nDonald Trump, the President of the United States, responded positively on Sunday, October 5, 2025, to Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to extend the New START treaty\u2014 the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between Washington and Moscow\u2014 by one year. Speaking to journalists outside the White House, Trump stated, 'That seems like a good idea,' signaling potential diplomatic thaw amid ongoing tensions. The comment was well received in Moscow, where Kirill Dmitriev, Putin\u2019s economic advisor and close Kremlin figure, said both countries are 'quite open' to reaching an agreement on the extension. Putin had previously criticized the U.S. on October 3, 2025, for delaying a response, asserting that if the U.S. does not need the extension, Russia also does not need it, and emphasizing Russia\u2019s confidence in its nuclear deterrent. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and 700 launchers, and includes mutual inspections. Originally set to expire in February 2026, Russia unilaterally suspended its participation in February 2023 following the start of the war in Ukraine. Moscow has since advocated for future arms agreements to include China, France, and the UK, citing a 'new multipolar order' and the expansion of nuclear arsenals beyond the Cold War axis. In late September, Putin proposed extending New START until February 2026, maintaining the existing numerical limits and stating Russia is prepared to uphold these limits for one year beyond February 5, 2026, provided the U.S. does not take actions that undermine strategic deterrence. Despite prior high-level meetings, such as the August meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska, formal negotiations on the extension have not yet begun. The proposal comes amid deteriorating U.S.-Russia relations, exacerbated by the ongoing war in Ukraine, now in its third year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/mundo/trump-putin-tratado-new-start)\n\n**Trump Says Putin's Nuclear Proposal 'Seems Like a Good Idea' Amid Escalating Tensions**\nIn the context of renewed tensions with Russia over the war in Ukraine, former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to extend the New START nuclear arms control treaty by one year 'seems like a good idea.'

Chris Van Hollen**\nSenator Chris Van Hollen delivered remarks at the Arms Control Association Annual Meeting on September 25, 2025, emphasizing the urgent threat of nuclear conflict and the need for robust arms control diplomacy. He highlighted that the Doomsday Clock stands at 89 seconds to midnight\u2014the closest it has ever been\u2014underscoring the existential risk of nuclear war. Van Hollen reflected on his decades-long involvement in nuclear arms control, beginning with his college activism and continuing through his Senate career. He criticized the Trump administration\u2019s approach, citing the 2018 withdrawal from the JCPOA, the subsequent erosion of Iran\u2019s compliance, and the UN Security Council\u2019s recent vote to trigger the snapback mechanism, which will reimpose sanctions on Iran unless reversed by September 28, 2025. He expressed skepticism about claims that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites 'obliterated' them, citing a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that the damage amounted to only a few months\u2019 delay, and criticized the firing of the DIA director for contradicting the administration\u2019s narrative. Van Hollen stressed that diplomacy remains viable and urged swift negotiations with Iran, the E3, and others to prevent escalation. He also addressed the impending expiration of the New START treaty in February 2026, welcoming Russia\u2019s offer to extend it for one year but calling on the Trump administration to reciprocate and begin talks on a follow-on agreement, including discussions on Russia\u2019s intermediate-range and hypersonic missiles. He noted China\u2019s rapidly growing nuclear arsenal\u2014now around 600 warheads\u2014and urged bilateral engagement despite China\u2019s resistance. Van Hollen condemned wasteful defense spending, citing the $140 billion cost of the Sentinel ICBM program (an 81% increase since prior estimates), the redundant SLCM program, and the proposed Golden Dome missile shield, which he likened to the failed Star Wars initiative and warned would cost hundreds of billions without strategic effectiveness. He cited a Congressional Budget Office projection of $946 billion in nuclear modernization costs from 2025 to 2034\u2014about $95 billion annually\u2014and called for cost-effective modernization. He also praised the Arms Control Association\u2019s advocacy for compliance with international humanitarian law in arms transfers and reaffirmed his work on National Security Memorandum 20 (NSM 20), which mandates that U.S.-supplied weapons be used in accordance with U.S. and international law\u2014though he criticized both the Biden and Trump administrations for failing to enforce it. Van Hollen concluded by reaffirming the enduring principle that 'a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,' a statement made by Gorbachev and Reagan in 1991, and pledged continued collaboration with the Arms Control Association to advance global security.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 09:17 PM\nSource:[Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/events-and-remarks/2025-10/2025-annual-meeting-remarks-sen-chris-van-hollen)\n\n**Washington and Beijing Test New Military Communication Channels Amid Ongoing Strategic Tensions**\nA bipartisan delegation from the U.S. Congress, led by Democratic Representative Adam Smith and including Ro Khanna, Chrissy Houlahan, and Republican Michael Baumgartner, concluded a five-day visit to China\u2014the first since 2019\u2014with indications of a potential opening by Beijing to strengthen military communication channels with Washington. The delegation met with Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun, focusing on reducing the risk of accidents and misunderstandings in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. According to Smith and Khanna, Dong expressed concern over escalation and acknowledged the need for concrete de-escalation steps, appearing non-confrontational and signaling a departure from the aggressive 'wolf-warrior diplomacy' rhetoric. However, the Chinese Ministry of Defense stated that improved military relations would depend on 'conditions created by the United States,' implying that progress may be contingent on U.S. concessions on sensitive issues such as Taiwan and arms sales to Taipei. Military contacts had been severed after Nancy Pelosi\u2019s 2022 visit to Taiwan, but limited technical dialogues resumed in 2024 under the Biden administration\u2014such as theater commander talks, defense policy consultations, and a bilateral naval forum\u2014though these remain fragile and subject to unilateral suspension by China. The Pentagon emphasized that deeper dialogue depends on mutual willingness. The visit also included meetings with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and Vice-Premier He Lifeng. Despite ongoing strategic rivalry, the trip signals a cautious effort by both sides to explore minimal military cooperation to prevent uncontrollable incidents in one of the world\u2019s most volatile regions.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 02:08 PM\nSource:[Formiche.net](https://formiche.net/2025/09/washington-e-pechino-testano-nuovi-canali-di-dialogo-militare-ecco-come/)\n\n**Can the US, Russia and China break their nuclear talks impasse?**\nThe article reports that President Donald Trump\u2019s push for a trilateral \u2018denuclearisation\u2019 dialogue with China was met with a firm rejection from Beijing.  Chinese foreign\u2011minister spokesman Guo\u202fJiakun called the proposal \u2018neither reasonable nor realistic\u2019 and warned that the United States, which holds the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenal, should \u2018earnestly fulfil its special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament\u2019 (Guo, quoted).  Analysts note that China\u2019s nuclear stockpile is projected to reach about 1,000 warheads by 2030, a figure that underscores Beijing\u2019s defensive posture and its insistence that it never pursues an arms race.\n\nThe article explains that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New\u202fSTART) between the United States and Russia is set to expire in February\u202f2026.  If no successor is negotiated, experts warn that the world could face a new era of strategic instability and an unconstrained nuclear competition among the US, Russia and China (analysts, quoted).  Trump\u2019s July statement that he would prioritise salvaging New\u202fSTART, while also seeking a broader agreement that includes China\u2019s rapid nuclear expansion, illustrates the tension between unilateral and multilateral approaches.\n\nExperts such as Tong\u202fZhao of the Carnegie Endowment and Mark\u202fKatz of George\u202fMason University argue that China\u2019s preference for bilateral risk\u2011reduction talks with the US makes a trilateral treaty unlikely in the near term.  Zhao notes that China\u2019s \u2018rapid nuclear expansion\u2019 is aimed at maintaining a minimum deterrent, not provoking an arms race.  Katz stresses that without Beijing\u2019s participation, a US\u2011Russia arms\u2011control deal would lack global significance.\n\nThe piece also cites nuclear\u2011physicist von\u202fHippel, who criticises Trump\u2019s repositioning of two US submarines closer to Russia and Moscow\u2019s threat to withdraw from the Intermediate\u2011Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, calling such posturing \u2018insane\u2019 and urging substantive diplomacy instead.\n\nOverall, the article presents a balanced overview of the diplomatic stances, quoting officials and scholars from both sides, and highlights the key metrics\u2014China\u2019s projected 1,000\u2011warhead arsenal, New\u202fSTART\u2019s February\u202f2026 expiry, and the lack of a clear successor\u2014while noting the risk of a renewed arms race if negotiations stall.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/us-russia-china-break-nuclear-093000766.html)\n\n**The dangerous new Washington consensus for more nuclear weapons**\nA growing consensus in Washington, driven by former Biden administration defense officials Pratap Narang and Shashank Vaddi, advocates for a significant expansion of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, citing threats from North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, and especially China, which they project will increase its nuclear warheads from 600 to 1,500 by 2035. They argue that the U.S. must develop 'more, different, and better' nuclear capabilities and advanced missile defense to enable 'damage limitation' strategies\u2014destroying adversary warheads before or after launch. This approach, however, promotes a war-fighting doctrine that embraces the possibility of nuclear first use and escalation, contradicting long-standing principles of deterrence through assured destruction. The article, authored by Joe Cirincione and published in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, counters that the U.S. already possesses over 5,177 nuclear warheads (including deployed, reserve, and retired but intact ones), making its force three times larger than China\u2019s projected 1,500 by 2035. The author argues that the real threat is not China\u2019s size but the dangerous shift toward nuclear war-fighting, which undermines global stability. The article criticizes the authors for ignoring successful past diplomacy, the impact of U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, and the role of political instability\u2014particularly Donald Trump\u2019s erratic policies\u2014in eroding allied confidence, which is not solved by more weapons. The piece warns that this 'new Washington consensus' is now dominant across parties, backed by a powerful nuclear lobby and massive budgets, and calls for urgent, persistent pushback to prevent irreversible escalation. The article concludes with a quote from Martin Perlmutter, calling the argument 'crackpot realism' and noting that nuclear weapons are increasingly the tools of the weak.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 07:41 PM\nSource:[thebulletin.org](https://thebulletin.org/2025/09/the-dangerous-new-washington-consensus-for-more-nuclear-weapons/)\n\n**80 anos ap\u00f3s Hiroshima, risco nuclear cresce com aumento da tens\u00e3o e menor controle**\nEight decades after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world is facing a growing nuclear threat due to increased tensions and decreased control. The number of nuclear warheads has increased, treaties have been abandoned, and powers like Russia, Iran, and Israel are escalating the global scenario. According to the SIPRI, there are approximately 12,100 nuclear warheads worldwide in 2024, with around 3,900 ready for immediate use, an increase from previous years. Nine countries officially possess nuclear arms: the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. The majority of the global arsenal remains concentrated in the US and Russia, but the growth of China's capabilities, Iran's nuclear program, and Israel's opaque arsenal are causing growing concerns. The war in Ukraine has brought the nuclear threat back into the political discourse, with Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly mentioning his country's nuclear arsenal, including positioning tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus and threatening the West in case of direct involvement. Russia abandoned its participation in the New START treaty in 2023, the last bilateral agreement with the US limiting strategic warheads, without mutual verification and with increasing tensions, the risk of miscalculation between powers is once again a concern. The Iranian nuclear program is another source of tension, with Tehran accelerating uranium enrichment and restricting international inspectors' access since the US withdrawal from the Nuclear Deal in 2018. Israel has never officially admitted to possessing nuclear arms, but it is widely accepted that the country maintains an arsenal of around 90 warheads, operated independently and outside any international treaty. This ambiguity has sustained deterrence against neighboring countries, especially Iran and Syria. In a potential direct confrontation with Tehran, the nuclear factor could escalate rapidly. The rapid advancement of China's nuclear program is another source of concern, with the number of Chinese warheads almost doubling in the last five years. According to Pentagon reports, China may surpass 1,000 warheads by the end of the decade, focusing on second-strike capability and intercontinental ballistic missile launch. At the same time, Beijing refuses to adhere to arms control treaties, claiming its arsenal is still much smaller than that of the US and Russia. The nuclear rise of China is already influencing the strategic posture of the Americans, who are now considering 'trilateral' deterrence scenarios. Much of the nuclear stability of the Cold War was built on arms control agreements. In the last 20 years, that architecture has crumbled: countries with unrecognized nuclear arms, like Israel and North Korea, do not participate in any control regime. The Doomsday Clock, maintained by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, is currently at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest point to global collapse since its creation in 1947. The nuclear threat, combined with the climate crisis and the advancement of AI in military applications, is among the main reasons. The world of 2025 is no longer the same as 1945, but the shadow of Hiroshima still looms. The difference is that now the risk does not come only from a superpower, but from multiple actors with diverse agendas and little room for dialogue.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 06, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mundo/80-anos-apos-hiroshima-risco-nuclear-cresce-com-aumento-da-tensao-e-menor-controle/)\n\n**French report highlights China threat - Taipei Times**\nFrance's 2025 National Strategic Review report highlights China's growing threat to the region, citing repeated military exercises around Taiwan and Beijing's escalating pressure on Taipei.

Nine nuclear powers have strengthened their arsenals in 2024. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) warns that the era of nuclear disarmament has come to an end. The number of nuclear arms has increased over the past 12 months, with the stock of nuclear arms now estimated at 9,614 warheads available, a 0.3% increase from 2024. The total is 12,241, including warheads withdrawn from service. 'By the end of 2024, nuclear disarmament seemed more difficult to achieve than ever since the end of the Cold War, especially since the strategic dialogue between Russia and the United States had indeed ceased,' says SIPRI. China's nuclear program is developing more rapidly than that of any other country due to 'important modernization and expansion work,' according to the report. Beijing is currently building new silos for its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in three large fields in northern China and three mountainous regions in eastern China. Since 2023, its arsenal has grown by 100 new nuclear arms per year, reaching 600 arms in 2025, making it the third-largest stock in the world. However, the majority of China's warheads are stored separately from their launchers. By the end of the decade, the country, which is currently the second-largest military spender in the world after the United States, could have at least as many ICBMs as Russia or Washington, even if its stock would remain below theirs. The tensions have undermined the dialogue between China and the United States on nuclear issues due to American support for Taiwan and economic sanctions against China. Russia and the United States still hold nearly 90% of all nuclear arms. 'The two states are implementing large-scale modernization programs that could increase the size and diversity of their arsenals in the future. If no new agreement is concluded to limit their stocks, the number of warheads they deploy on strategic missiles seems likely to increase after the expiration, in February 2026, of the 2010 bilateral treaty on measures to pursue the reduction and limitation of offensive strategic arms (New START),' says SIPRI. Regardless, SIPRI analysts indicate that Russia's nuclear modernization effort has suffered a setback and a new delay for the new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. In addition, the modernization of other systems is progressing more slowly than planned. In the United States, proponents of nuclear power are pressuring authorities to follow China's new developments. The United States could increase its capabilities by reactivating empty launchers, increasing the number of its non-strategic nuclear arms, and deploying more warheads on existing launchers. In Europe, France has the largest nuclear arsenal, with 290 arms, almost all ready for combat. In 2024, Paris continued its program to develop third-generation submarine-launched missiles and a new air-launched cruise missile. Like France, the United Kingdom has committed to strengthening its nuclear maritime capabilities by building four new nuclear-powered submarines. Although the country does not appear to have increased its arsenal last year, which currently counts 225 nuclear arms, the government announced a few weeks ago new investments in a maximum of 12 new nuclear-powered submarines as part of the AUKUS program. The authorities declared that it was a 'response to the rapid increase in threats.' The investment is part of a \u00a315 billion (\u20ac17.5 billion) budget dedicated to the country's warhead program.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: June 19, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://fr.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/06/19/armes-nucleaires-quel-est-le-pays-dont-larsenal-se-developpe-le-plus-rapidement)\n\n**Nuclear Arsenals: Which Countries Are Increasing Their Stockpiles?**\nAccording to experts, we are in the most dangerous moment since the 'end of the Cold War': in 2024, the main nuclear powers have strengthened their arsenals. The era of nuclear disarmament seems to have come to an end, warned experts from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) this week. Between global tensions and regional conflicts, researchers say that the number of nuclear weapons seems to have increased in the last 12 months. The stock of nuclear weapons is now estimated at 9,614 available warheads, 0.3% more than in 2023. The total is 12,241, including 'retired' warheads. 'By the end of 2024, nuclear disarmament seemed more elusive than at any other time since the end of the Cold War,' Sipri said, 'especially because the strategic dialogue between Russia and the United States has effectively ceased.' China is racing to catch up. China's nuclear program is growing faster than any other country thanks to 'significant modernization and expansion work,' according to the report. Beijing is currently building new silos for its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in three large fields in northern China and three mountainous areas in central-eastern China. Since 2023, its arsenal has expanded by 100 new nuclear warheads per year, reaching 600 in 2025, making it the third largest reserve in the world. However, it is believed that most Chinese warheads are stored separately from their launchers. By the end of the decade, China, which is currently the second-largest military spender after the United States, could have a number of intercontinental missiles at least equal to that of Russia or Washington, although it is expected that its arsenal will remain lower than that of these two countries. Tensions have undermined the dialogue between China and the United States on nuclear issues due to US support for Taiwan and economic sanctions against China. US-Russia: the 2026 deadline for reducing nuclear arsenals is approaching. Russia and the United States still hold almost 90% of all nuclear weapons. 'Both countries are implementing extensive modernization programs that could increase the size and diversity of their arsenals in the future,' Sipri said. 'If no new agreement is reached to limit their stockpiles, the number of warheads deployed on strategic missiles seems destined to increase after the expiration of the 2010 Bilateral Treaty on Measures for Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START) in February 2026.' In any case, according to Sipri analysts, Russia's nuclear modernization effort has suffered test failures and further delays for the new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. In addition, updates to other systems are proceeding more slowly than expected. In the United States, authorities are under pressure from nuclear supporters to keep pace with China's new developments. The United States could increase its capabilities by reactivating empty launchers, increasing non-strategic nuclear arms, and distributing more warheads on existing launchers. France and the UK will boost their nuclear submarine fleet. In Europe, France has the largest nuclear arsenal, with 290 weapons, almost all ready for combat. In 2024, Paris continued its program of developing third-generation nuclear missiles launched from submarines and a new air-launched cruise missile. Like France, the UK has also committed to enhancing its nuclear capabilities by building four new nuclear-powered submarines with ballistic missiles. Although it is believed that the country did not increase its arsenal last year, which currently stands at 225 nuclear warheads, a few weeks ago the government announced new investments in a maximum of twelve new nuclear-powered submarines as part of the Aukus program. The authorities stated that this is done 'in response to the rapid increase in threats.' The investment is part of a budget of 17.5 billion euros for the country's nuclear warhead testing program.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 19, 2025 02:07 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://it.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/06/19/quali-paesi-stanno-aumentando-il-loro-arsenale-nucleare-la-cina-insegue-russia-e-usa)\n\n**China's Nuclear Arsenal Grows Rapidly, Raising Global Concerns**\nA new research report has shown that China has become the fastest-growing nuclear power in the world, with an estimated 600 nuclear warheads, according to satellite images and open-source intelligence data. This rapid growth has raised global concerns about a new nuclear arms race, amidst increasing geostrategic tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. Historically, China's nuclear arsenal has been considered modest compared to the United States and Russia, which possess thousands of nuclear warheads. However, with increasing strategic tensions in the South China Sea and Taiwan, and military competition with Washington, Beijing appears to be adopting an expansionist policy in its nuclear capabilities. According to analysts, China has increased its production rate of nuclear warheads to approximately 100 per year since 2023, a significant change from its previously described 'minimum deterrent' policy. The report notes that China has built new facilities for storing nuclear warheads and updating its ballistic missile launch silos, indicating strategic preparations for the long term. The report also shows that the number of Chinese nuclear warheads has increased from 410 in 2022 to over 600 in mid-2025, with the current production rate suggesting that China may have over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. Dr. Mark Hendley, a nuclear proliferation expert from the University of Oxford, said, 'The rapid increase in China's nuclear arsenal indicates a significant strategic shift, and possibly Beijing's desire to achieve a nuclear balance with the United States, which may reshape global deterrence rules.' Dr. Emma Taylor, a researcher at the Center for Arms Control in Washington, added, 'These numbers raise concerns in the absence of nuclear control agreements that include China, leaving the door open for an unregulated arms race.' In response to the report, the United States has made repeated calls for nuclear transparency and strategic dialogue with China, while Beijing has maintained a formal silence on the report, with the Chinese Defense Ministry stating that China's nuclear capabilities remain defensive in nature.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 18, 2025 06:12 PM\nSource:[Albawaba](https://www.albawabhnews.com/5219296)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a range of expert perspectives\u2014including diplomacy, nuclear policy, security studies, international relations, and Chinese foreign policy\u2014the consensus is that the base rate of new, substantive U.S.-China engagement on nuclear risk reduction is historically low, hampered by persistent Chinese reluctance, deep mutual mistrust, and heightened regional tensions (notably over Taiwan). The return of the Trump administration introduces additional unpredictability, further reducing expectations for robust or sustained dialogue. However, nearly all experts highlight that the resolution criteria for the question are broad and permissive: even an acknowledged Track 1.5 or Track 2 dialogue, or a single public statement or working group, would meet the bar for increased engagement.\n\nMost forecasters cite recent developments\u2014such as a September 2025 bipartisan U.S. congressional visit to China, Chinese openness (albeit tentative and conditional) to renewed military communication, and external pressure from impending arms control deadlines (e.g., New START expiration)\u2014as nudging the probability upward for at least minimal engagement. Multiple experts note that both sides have strong risk-reduction incentives given the dangers of accidental escalation and rapid arsenal growth. There is broad agreement that while meaningful, institutionalized arms control talks remain unlikely, a modest increase in engagement (as defined by the question) is more likely than not.\n\nFinal probabilities cluster in a moderately optimistic range\u2014most between 62% and 68% for a 'Yes', with only one cautious outlier at 40% (emphasizing persistent obstacles and the low historical base rate). Scenario planning across domains converges: a 'Yes' outcome would likely entail an officially acknowledged Track 1.5 meeting, working group, or joint statement referencing nuclear risk, rather than a breakthrough agreement, while a 'No' would require complete stalling or unacknowledged/inadequate engagement despite ongoing risks.\n\nIn sum, the expert consensus is that the loose resolution criteria and mounting (if cautious) diplomatic activity make a minimal\u2014but sufficient\u2014increase in U.S.-China nuclear risk reduction engagement more probable than not by the end of 2025, despite the difficult context.",
