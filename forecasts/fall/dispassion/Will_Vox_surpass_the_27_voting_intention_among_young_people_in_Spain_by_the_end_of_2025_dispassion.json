From a sampling error perspective, while most movements near the plateau are dampened by post-stratification, the current status quo (27%) puts even a small stochastic nudge, or a short-lived external momentum (e.g., a viral campaign), within reach of a >27% reading.

Moreover, structural base rates are recalibrating in real time given European comparators (e.g., AfD with youth in Germany), and Spanish polling history suggests sporadic, outsized swings in direct intent for 'breakout' parties.

From a party system theory perspective, even in periods of rapid realignment, there are strong status quo and ceiling effects, particularly once a historical high is already reached; rallies and minor shocks can produce volatility, but party ID, especially under conditions of high abstention and persistent gender gaps, changes more sluggishly. Moreover, with the survey using direct intention (rather than more volatile preference or favorability metrics) and the likelihood of regression to the mean in the absence of a clear exogenous trigger, the probability of crossing this salient barrier in such a short time window is structurally constrained.

The combination of multi-wave smoothing and post-stratification likely both reduces the chance that a stochastic uptick is published and ensures that any published breach of 27% would more likely reflect a real underlying shift. Additionally, status quo psychological effects and youth disengagement further reinforce inertia at high plateaux.

Your recognition that the proximity to the threshold elevates risk, but does not assure a breakout, synchronizes with generational patterns where each new high in support for populist parties is heavily contested and prone to oscillation rather than straight-line continuation.

Moreover, the trend in Spanish youth intention polling over the past year shows sharp upward movement but also rapid regression to the mean after spikes, especially as issue salience and digital campaigns cycle. Given the absence of a recent or anticipated external shock to fundamentally animate new voters, and the plateaued status in recent data, relying on volatility to generate a new high seems optimistic.

This reduces the probability that a purely stochastic movement above 27% will be published absent a real, durable change in underlying sentiment. While youth volatility remains higher than average, the presence of such adjustments suggests my original estimate put too much weight on the potential for 'lucky' sampling error without enough evidence of plausible new positive drivers.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nVox is a political party founded in 2013 in Spain, classified by political scientists and media outlets as a far-right or right-wing populist party. In recent years, its support among young voters has attracted significant attention. According to [ <u>recent 40dB polls</u> ](https://ep00.epimg.net/infografias/encuestas40db/2025/02-barometro/2025_02_barometro_voto.pdf) published by El Pa\u00eds, Vox receives 27% support among voters aged 18-24, its highest percentage across all age groups. This is notably higher than its support among older demographics, which ranges from 10-19%.\n\n This pattern of increased youth support for far-right parties [ <u>is not unique to Spain</u> ](https://elpais.com/internacional/2024-06-15/el-voto-de-los-jovenes-a-la-extrema-derecha-crece-en-los-cinco-mayores-paises-de-la-ue.html), as Marine Le Pen's RN in France and AfD in Germany have also seen an increase in youth support in recent years.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":35263,\"question_id\":34747}}`",

Sociologist Rafael\u202fL\u00f3pez, who appeared on the show, explained that the situation is complex, noting that \"the first party for young people is abstention, not Vox\" and that the far\u2011right simplifies the problem.

The article draws on a series of CIS barometers from 1986 to 2025 to chart how 18\u2011to\u201124\u2011year\u2011olds\u2019 self\u2011perceived ideology has shifted.  In 2015, 8\u202f% of this age group identified as right\u2011wing, rising sharply to 34\u202f% in 2025, while left\u2011wing identification fell from 40\u202f% to 31\u202f%.  The centre, defined as those rating their ideology between 4 and 6, has contracted across all ages, with the youngest cohort moving toward right\u2011leaning options.  Catalonia mirrors the national trend; the 18\u201124 bracket moved from the lowest to the second\u2011highest average ideological score.  Electoral intentions reflect these shifts: Vox is the most supported party among 18\u201124\u2011year\u2011olds, with 21.4\u202f% direct voting intention, and in Catalonia a three\u2011way tie between PSC, ERC and Vox at roughly 13\u202f% each.  Gender differences are evident\u2014young men are more right\u2011leaning and show less interest in feminism, whereas young women lean left and express greater feminist engagement.  A European study cited in the piece notes that men aged 16\u201129 vote more for the far\u2011right, a trend that has widened in recent years and could significantly impact European societies.  The article presents these findings in a data\u2011driven, neutral tone, highlighting the evolving political landscape among Spain\u2019s youth.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 06:01 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20250920/jovenes-son-izquierdas-padres-121712229)\n\n**Rafael L\u00f3pez, sociologist: 'The far\u2011right excels at swapping truth for virality'**\nThe program \"laSexta Xplica\" examined the rise of the far\u2011right in Spain.

The PSC remains the most voted party but would lose six seats, dropping from 42 to 36. Junts would suffer a larger fall, losing 14 seats and falling from 35 to 21. Alianza\u202fCatalana would surge, gaining 17 seats (from 2 to 19) with 11.9% of the vote, while Vox would increase its representation from 11 to 16 seats with 12.1% of the vote, surpassing the PP. ERC would obtain 14.7% of the vote and 21 seats; Comuns would get 4.9% and 5 seats. The poll indicates that the PSC could win the election with 25.1% of the vote but would be unable to form a majority with ERC and Comuns. The article warns that the rise of far\u2011right forces threatens an ungovernable Catalonia if current trends continue. Key issues for voters are politics (18%), housing (18%) and immigration (16%). Immigration support for Alianza and Vox has quadrupled, rising from 4% to 16% in one year. Fifty percent of respondents believe Catalonia is on the wrong path, while only 26% think it is going well. Interviews quoted in the article include Barcelona mayor Jaume Collboni, who said 'Los presupuestos del 2026 y 2027 congelar\u00e1n impuestos a familias y pymes', and Junts secretary Jordi Turull, who declared 'el seguidismo de Illa con respecto a Madrid empobrece a Catalunya'.

Youth such as stylist Kata are actively supporting Tisza, saying \u2018C\u2019est notre derni\u00e8re chance\u2026\u2019 and describing the current regime as \u2018toxique\u2019.

The article draws on a series of CIS barometers from 1986 to 2025 to chart how 18\u2011to\u201124\u2011year\u2011olds\u2019 self\u2011perceived ideology has shifted.  In 2015, 8\u202f% of this age group identified as right\u2011wing, rising sharply to 34\u202f% in 2025, while left\u2011wing identification fell from 40\u202f% to 31\u202f%.  The centre, defined as those rating their ideology between 4 and 6, has contracted across all ages, with the youngest cohort moving toward right\u2011leaning options.  Catalonia mirrors the national trend; the 18\u201124 bracket moved from the lowest to the second\u2011highest average ideological score.  Electoral intentions reflect these shifts: Vox is the most supported party among 18\u201124\u2011year\u2011olds, with 21.4\u202f% direct voting intention, and in Catalonia a three\u2011way tie between PSC, ERC and Vox at roughly 13\u202f% each.  Gender differences are evident\u2014young men are more right\u2011leaning and show less interest in feminism, whereas young women lean left and express greater feminist engagement.  A European study cited in the piece notes that men aged 16\u201129 vote more for the far\u2011right, a trend that has widened in recent years and could significantly impact European societies.  The article presents these findings in a data\u2011driven, neutral tone, highlighting the evolving political landscape among Spain\u2019s youth.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 06:01 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20250920/jovenes-son-izquierdas-padres-121712229)\n\n**Poll: 91% of French Support Banning Rioters from Demonstrations**\nA CSA poll conducted for Europe\u202f1, CNews and the Journal du Dimanche found that 91\u202f% of French respondents support banning \"casseurs\" (rioters) from demonstrations, 8\u202f% oppose the idea and 1\u202f% remain undecided. The support is high across demographic groups: 89\u202f% of men and 92\u202f% of women are in favour; CSP+ 90\u202f%, CSP\u2011 91\u202f% and inactive 90\u202f% also show strong backing. Age\u2011group data reveal that, except for the 25\u201134 bracket (80\u202f%), all other age ranges are above 90\u202f% in favour, with 18\u201124, 50\u201164 and 65\u202f+ at 93\u202f% each and 35\u201149 at 90\u202f%. Politically, the majority of left\u2011wing voters (81\u202f%) favour the ban, while the far\u2011right parties show even higher support: Renaissance 97\u202f%, LR 93\u202f% and RN 96\u202f%. Within left factions, the Socialist Party is at 89\u202f%, LFI 72\u202f% and the Greens 71\u202f%.

According to recent surveys by CIS and 40db for Cadena SER and El\u202fPa\u00eds, the voting intention for Vox among women 60+ is only 8.3%. The article notes that Vox\u2019s support drops sharply after age 44 and continues to decline with increasing age. It features quotes from prominent women: director Isabel Coixet says, 'Tengo 65 a\u00f1os, y he visto muchas cosas\u2026 Cuando veo a estos se\u00f1ores de ultraderecha hablando de valores tradicionales se me ponen los pelos de punta\u2026 Me da la risa', and former university rector Josefina G\u00f3mez Mendoza says, 'Yo nac\u00ed en los a\u00f1os 40, los m\u00e1s duros de la dictadura\u2026 Si en los a\u00f1os y las elecciones que me quedan se me ocurre votar a la extrema derecha es que habr\u00eda perdido la cabeza'.

The poll indicates that the PP\u2019s majority\u2011right coalition remains stable and that the party\u2019s prospects of governing without Vox are not currently threatened. The survey also highlights Spanish public opinion on several policy issues, including a strong condemnation of uncontrolled immigration, support for debt forgiveness, and only modest backing for sanctions against Israel. These findings suggest that while the PP dominates the current political landscape, its stance on key international and economic matters continues to shape voter preferences.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 04:54 PM\nSource:[elliberal.cat](https://www.elliberal.cat/2025/09/18/los-espanoles-condenan-la-inmigracion-descontrolada-la-condonacion-de-deuda-y-apoyan-muy-levemente-las-sanciones-a-israel/)\n\n**Vox Captures Youth: Tradition, Rebellion, and Social Media Make the Difference**\nThe article reports that Vox has become the preferred political option among Spanish youth, surpassing PSOE and PP in direct voting intention for voters under 35. According to the latest 40dB barometer, Vox has a 17.4% national vote estimate, but its real strength lies in the 18\u201134 age group where it is the second\u2011largest force and, in some segments, close to the top. The piece attributes Vox\u2019s appeal to a blend of traditional values, anti\u2011progressive rhetoric, and a highly targeted digital strategy that uses short videos, memes, and viral content on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. It notes that Vox\u2019s messaging focuses on employment, affordable housing and public safety\u2014issues that resonate with young people facing precarious jobs and high rents. The article quotes the party\u2019s slogan: 'Con VOX, Espa\u00f1a tendr\u00e1 un futuro pr\u00f3spero y asegurado', and highlights the party\u2019s use of international far\u2011right figures to reinforce a sense of global solidarity. The data cited include the 17.4% national estimate, the rise of Vox in the 18\u201134 segment, and the loss of five points by PSOE among 18\u201124 year\u2011olds in a year. The tone is largely factual, presenting statistics and party statements, though it frames Vox\u2019s rise as a challenge to the \u2018old politics\u2019 and portrays the party in a positive light for its youth\u2011oriented strategy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 10:09 PM\nSource:[Periodista digital](https://www.periodistadigital.com/politica/20250916/vox-conquista-juventud-tradicion-rebeldia-redes-sociales-marcan-diferencia-noticia-689405132457/)\n\n**Who Are the Catalan Ultras?**\nThe article examines the electoral base of the two right\u2011wing parties that have recently risen in Catalonia\u2014Vox and Alian\u00e7a Catalana\u2014by analysing demographic and polling data. It notes that Vox\u2019s support is strongest among young men aged 18\u201134, where the party\u2019s intention to vote reaches 15%, and even higher, 17%, among those aged 18\u201124, outpacing the CUP, PSC and ERC by five percentage points. In the same age group, the ultra\u2011nationalist party led by Silvia Orriols records more than 11% intention, compared with an average of about 5% for all parties. The article cites that in 2024, roughly one in ten former Junts voters and one in fifteen former PP voters would now back Alian\u00e7a, a shift that could push Orriols\u2019 party over 250,000 ballots. It also highlights that Vox\u2019s share of the vote among men under 35 is the highest among all parties, and that immigration is a key driver of ultra\u2011right voting, with many voters prioritising anti\u2011immigration concerns over their Catalan or Spanish identity. The piece uses phrases such as 'extrema derecha xen\u00f3foba' and discusses how the generational shift in Catalonia may favour authoritarian\u2011leaning offers. The analysis is data\u2011driven but carries a political slant, focusing on the rise of right\u2011wing forces.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 04:12 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20250914/11010584/quienes-son-ultras-catalanes.html)\n\n**Vox Celebrates Festival Without Milei, Riding Rising Poll Numbers**\nVox is celebrating its annual political festival in Madrid this weekend, even though Argentine libertarian leader Javier Milei will not attend because he has cancelled his trip amid a political crisis at home. The party\u2019s popularity has surged: recent polls show Vox exceeding 17\u202f% of the vote and potentially reaching 20\u202f% in future surveys, a level that could make it a decisive force in the next Spanish legislature. The article notes that more than one million former Partido Popular (PP) voters have switched to Vox in the last year, and that Vox is the most preferred party among 18\u2011 to 24\u2011year\u2011olds, surpassing Podemos in that age group. It also highlights that Vox\u2019s support is strongest among younger voters, while older voters (65\u202f+) still favor the PP. In presidential preference polls, Vox\u2019s leader Santiago\u202fAbascal leads Pedro\u202fS\u00e1nchez among 18\u2011 to 30\u2011year\u2011olds and outpaces Alberto\u202fN\u00fa\u00f1ez\u202fFeij\u00f3o among 18\u2011 to 40\u2011year\u2011olds, but Feij\u00f3o remains ahead of Abascal among those over 65. The article cites the latest CIS barometer, which reports that the majority of 18\u2011 to 45\u2011year\u2011olds answer \u2018none\u2019 when asked who they prefer as president. It also discusses how the PP is attempting to copy Vox\u2019s messaging, while the PSOE is portrayed as a \u2018refuge party\u2019 for left\u2011wing voters. The piece points out that Vox\u2019s social\u2011media presence on Tik\u2011Tok and Instagram is the strongest among young people, and that the party\u2019s alliances with Viktor\u202fOrb\u00e1n and Marine\u202fLe\u202fPen are seen as strategic. Finally, the article explains that Milei\u2019s absence is due to his loss in the Buenos Aires provincial elections, where he was defeated by a margin of more than thirteen points, and that his sister Karina is embroiled in a corruption scandal. The overall tone is analytical but carries a clear political bias in favor of Vox\u2019s rise.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 04:28 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20250913/11055890/vox-milei.html)\n\n**European Youth Shift Toward Left and Right Populism Amid Traditional Party Disillusionment**\nEuropean youth in France, Germany and Spain are increasingly turning to left\u2011 and right\u2011wing populist parties because traditional parties have failed to address their economic and social concerns.  In France, Marine Le Pen and Jean\u2011Luc M\u00e9lenchon have gained traction among young voters who face precarious jobs and unaffordable housing, as illustrated by Lucie, a secondary\u2011school teacher in Tours, who says, 'A mi edad, mis padres ya ten\u00edan casa. Yo apenas puedo ahorrar'.  In Germany, 27\u202f% of voters aged 18\u201124 supported Die\u202fLinke and 22\u202f% backed the far\u2011right AfD, reflecting a sentiment that 'La pol\u00edtica es hecha por viejos y para viejos, no para j\u00f3venes', according to Alexandria, a university student in Munich.  Spain\u2019s youth unemployment exceeds 26\u202f%, and only 15\u202f% of people under 30 live independently, a situation highlighted by sociologist Jorge Galindo who warned that the country\u2019s \u2018burbuja inmobiliaria\u2019 leaves young people traumatized.

The People's Party (PP) has fallen to 32.2\u202f%, a decline of 2.6\u202fpercentage points from the July survey and 2.4\u202fpoints below its 2023 election result.  Vox\u2019s rise has come at the expense of the PP, which now loses 4.5\u202f% of its electorate to Vox, up from 13.2\u202f% in the previous poll.  The Socialists (PSOE) have slipped to 28.6\u202f%, a drop of 7\u202fpercentage points, while the new party Sumar has gained 6.6\u202f% and Podemos 3.4\u202f%.  The survey also reports that Vox retains 86.7\u202f% of its voters, the PP 71.2\u202f%, and the PSOE 64.2\u202f%.  The article notes that the PP\u2019s decline is linked to the political backlash over the handling of forest fires in Castilla\u2011La Mancha, Galicia and Extremadura, all governed by the PP, and that the PSOE\u2019s recent scandal involving former secretary of organization Santos Cerd\u00e1n has helped it recover some support.  In terms of age and gender, Vox is strongest among men (22.3\u202f%) and the 18\u201124 age group (20.9\u202f%), while the PSOE leads among women (21.5\u202f%) and the 25\u201134 age bracket (15.2\u202f%).  The poll\u2019s findings suggest that the right\u2011wing bloc (PP\u202f+\u202fVox) now holds 48.1\u202f% of the estimated vote, 10.4\u202fpercentage points ahead of the left\u2011wing bloc (PSOE\u202f+\u202fSumar\u202f+\u202fPodemos).

The PSOE sits at 27.7%, down from 29.8% after the Cerd\u00e1n corruption scandal, while Sumar rises to 6.6% from 6.2% and Podemos falls to 3.4% from 3.8%. Vox\u2019s gain of 2.2 points is the largest swing, and the poll shows that 17.7% of voters who chose PP in 2023 would now back Vox, compared with only 13% in the previous survey. Regionally, Vox leads in Andaluc\u00eda (20.5%) and Valencia (20.7%), while the PSOE is strongest in Castilla y Le\u00f3n (21.5%) and Galicia (22.4%). \"El bar\u00f3metro de 40dB. para la Cadena SER y 'El Pa\u00eds' revela que si hoy se celebrasen elecciones, la ultraderecha obtendr\u00eda un 17,4% de los votos\".\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 05:28 AM\nSource:[Cadena SER](https://cadenaser.com/nacional/2025/09/08/el-ascenso-de-vox-coloca-al-pp-en-su-peor-resultado-desde-las-elecciones-generales-cadena-ser/)\n\n**The 16\u2011Year\u2011Old Vote Favors EH\u202fBildu and Vox | El Diario Vasco**\nEl Diario Vasco reports that lowering the voting age to 16 in the Basque Country would add roughly 40,000 new voters, a figure that experts say would largely benefit EH\u202fBildu and Vox.  According to the CIS, in the last Basque elections EH\u202fBildu would capture nearly 30\u202f% of voters under 24, compared with 26\u202f% for the PNV.  Nationally, recent 40db polls place Vox as the leading force among young voters, with the PP attracting older voters and the PSOE leading the progressive young vote.  Mar\u00eda\u202fSilvestre notes that the Basque electorate would see EH\u202fBildu as the most benefited party, the PSE\u2011EE a slight boost, and the PNV hurt.  Ainara\u202fVilla\u00f1o adds that the demographic imbalance (37\u202f% of voters aged 45\u201164, <13\u202f% under 29) would be partially corrected.  The experts conclude that the right age of 16 is cognitively sufficient for political decisions, citing UNICEF evidence and examples from Germany, Brazil, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Scotland, Wales and Malta.  They stress that the debate should focus on civic participation rather than maturity.  \"el derecho a voto no tiene que ver con nuestras capacidades sino con el ejercicio pleno de la ciudadan\u00eda,\" says Mart\u00ednez.  \"El derecho a voto no deber\u00eda moverse por tanto en t\u00e9rminos de madurez intelectual sino de invitaci\u00f3n a la participaci\u00f3n c\u00edvica,\" adds Silvestre.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 23, 2025 10:01 PM\nSource:[El Diario Vasco](https://www.diariovasco.com/politica/voto-jovenes-decanta-bildu-vox-20250824131023-nt.html)\n\n**The Lost Generation of Democracy: Spain's Rise of the Far-Right**\nSpain is joining the list of countries where young people are fueling the rise of the far-right and authoritarian ultraderecha. A decade ago, one in three young people expressed their intention to vote for the left, while only one in four thought they would vote for the right. However, in recent surveys, the correlation has been reversed: four in ten young people between 18 and 24 years old support the right (and two-thirds of them support the ultraderecha), while only two in ten choose left-wing options. This age group now accounts for over three million voters out of a total of 37 million. The most significant aspect of this ideological shift is the rapid and unprecedented growth of the ultraderecha among young people. In the CIS survey of May, the conservative space was divided equally between the Partido Popular (20%) and the ultraderecha of Vox and Alvise (22%) among those under 24. A similar correlation occurred in the 25-34 age group (a contingent that accounts for another five million voters). However, this pattern is maintained, intensified, in the CIS survey of July: the ultraderecha has a 13-point lead over the PP in the 18-24 age group, and more than six points in the next age group (25-34 years). The mutation of the ideological youth in Spain has no precedents. With the country just out of the dictatorship, young people leaned clearly to the left (and their location on the ideological scale reflected this, as they now sit one point to the right). Even in the early 90s, the percentage of young people under 35 who supported the PSOE or more left-wing forces doubled or even tripled the rate of adhesions to the right. The data from last May provides clues about the causes of this change. If the declared voting intention is segregated by sex, the result is very eloquent: among men aged 18-24, Vox outperforms the PP by almost eleven points (and seven in the 25-34 age group). However, among young women, it is the Partido Popular that outperforms the ultras: by 12 points in the 18-24 age group, and seven in the 25-34 age group. In short, the ultraderechization of young men has something of an egoistic rebellion against the advance of gender parity. Nevertheless, Spain is not an exceptional case. Other Western countries are experiencing a sustained rise in extreme right-wing parties with the decisive support of new generations. The recent Polish presidential elections are a good example: the ultra-candidate clearly won among those under 40 (and with a greater advantage among men). And something similar occurred in the German legislative elections, although here the young people radicalized towards the two extremes (AfD, to the right, and Die Linke, to the left). Of course, there are exceptions. In the Canadian legislative elections, the Liberal Party (center-left) won over the Conservative Party (close to Trump) thanks to the vote of those under 35 (and especially women). In contrast, the age group between 35 and 54 leaned towards the conservatives. However, unlike what happens not only on the other side of the Atlantic, in the Spanish case, the low level of education still does not play decisively in favor of the ultraderecha, which is residual among those who barely went to school (46% of them vote for the PSOE). And although Vox is also marginal among the working class, it is starting to have presence among the poorest.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 13, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20250713/10808553/generacion-perdida-democracia.html)\n\n**VOX's Quest for a Broad Appeal: Can the Party Win Over Older Voters?**\nVOX, a far-right party in Spain, is gaining popularity among young people, but it still needs to win over older voters to be a determining force in the next election. According to the author, VOX needs to pass the 40-deputy threshold to be significant. To achieve this, the party needs to refine its message, avoid being too confrontational, and present a more optimistic and attractive image. The author notes that a third of Spaniards between 18 and 24 years old are disenchanted with politics and plan to abstain from voting, while another third intend to support VOX. The party's leader, Santiago Abascal, has expressed pride in VOX's growth among young people, but the author argues that the party should also focus on winning over older voters, who make up a significant portion of the population. As Spain faces a demographic winter, with over a third of the population over 65, VOX needs to appeal to a broader range of voters to be a major player in the next election. 'It is ilusionante that te respalden en masa los chavales, pero viendo los datos y pensando en lo que se avecina, si yo fuera Abascal estar\u00eda a estas horas estrujando el cerebro para afinar el mensaje y lograr que los viejos tambi\u00e9n apoyen a VOX', the author writes, quoting themselves. 'It is essential that the party's message is not just appealing to young people, but also to older voters, who are a crucial part of the population', they add.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 09, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[Periodista digital](https://www.periodistadigital.com/politica/opinion/columnistas/20250709/alfonso-rojo-chavales-espanoles-pasan-regimen-sanchista-sintonizan-dia-vox-video-689405109902/)\n\n",

However, limiting factors are also substantial: very high youth abstention rates, a persistent gender gap (young women remain much less supportive), the potential for polling volatility or sampling noise, ceiling effects after sharp surges, and possible fragmentation from other far-right or protest parties. Several experts highlight that fleeting spikes over the threshold could occur due to social or political shocks, survey error, or viral moments, but also note that sustained further growth is historically rare without major new events. Final probabilities from the panel range from 27% to 66% for a Yes outcome, with most forecasts clustering between 30% and 43%, but two outliers at 62% and 66% citing momentum, volatility, and international context. The modal view is that a Yes outcome is plausible\u2014especially given volatility and the minimal gap to the threshold\u2014but not more likely than not, with the base case favoring either stasis at 27% or a modest regression below it in late 2025 polling unless a significant shock occurs.",
