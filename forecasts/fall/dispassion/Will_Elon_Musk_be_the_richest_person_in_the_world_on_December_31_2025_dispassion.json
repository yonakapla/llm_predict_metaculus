The probability assigned (87) seems to give too much weight to the possibility of abrupt swings, when the statistical base rates for such a reversal in a short period and at this gap are extremely low, especially given the inertia in billionaire rankings.

For example, a negative event at Tesla can quickly affect perceptions and thus valuations at SpaceX or xAI, due to both investor psychology and cross-holdings. This network effect, while unlikely to materialize into a $100B reversal in a short window, is not fully captured by simple arithmetic lead calculations. Thus, while the base rate for turnover is indeed very low, the probability should reflect a nonzero chance of network-induced contagion or feedback loops that could accelerate a reversal, even if the lead is large.

Therefore, in light of the group consensus and the weakness of counterarguments for imminent reversal, I am revising my probability slightly upward.",

The deliberation reinforced the importance of both statistical inertia and psychological/narrative anchoring, while several defenses of slightly higher probabilities (94-95) highlighted that even the inherent volatility of Musk\u2019s holdings is unlikely to translate into a sudden enough reversal. Critiques of lower probabilities (e.g., 87) for emphasizing volatility over base rates also resonated. While my initial probability was already high and well-justified, this additional consensus and the absence of any credible rival catalyst or imminent legal resolution suggest a modest upward revision is warranted. The probability that Musk remains the richest on December 31, 2025, is therefore best represented by 94, which is slightly more aggressive yet still judicious, reflecting both the depth of his lead and the persistent minor tail risks.",

Critiques of some forecasts emphasize that, while tail risks from governance crises or regulatory shocks exist, they remain theoretical and lack concrete evidence or triggers in the current environment. No new arguments or data have emerged to suggest that Musk\u2019s lead is at material risk in the next 2.5 months.

Most experts assign probabilities in the 88\u201395 range, with the highest credence given to status quo inertia and the low base rate for rapid reversals at this magnitude. The critiques raised do not identify any overlooked, plausible pathway for a reversal before year-end; if anything, the group discussion further strengthened the case for status quo persistence by adding nuance to legal and industry-specific risk factors.

This milestone cements Musk as the most influential entrepreneur globally, driven by his impact on electric mobility, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. However, Bloomberg's Billionaires Index values his wealth at $470 billion, highlighting discrepancies in valuation methods\u2014particularly due to Musk's significant holdings in private companies like SpaceX and xAI, whose assets are not publicly traded. His net worth growth is directly tied to the expansion of Tesla and SpaceX, whose rising valuations have made previously unattainable milestones achievable. Despite the staggering figure, Musk\u2019s wealth is largely illiquid, consisting of stock holdings and hard-to-convert assets, representing potential rather than immediate cash. The announcement has sparked debate over economic inequality and the role of extreme wealth in society, with some praising Musk\u2019s innovation-driven progress and others criticizing the concentration of wealth amid deep social disparities. Nonetheless, the $500 billion threshold solidifies Musk as a central figure in the global economy and a defining force in 21st-century technological advancement.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 03:07 PM\nSource:[HSB Noticias](https://www.hsbnoticias.com/elon-musk-rompe-record-primer-ser-humano-en-superar-los-500-mil-millones-de-dolares/)\n\n**After Being Named 'The Richest Man in History,' Elon Musk Says He Might Move to Mars and Die There**\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX, has not ruled out spending his final days on Mars, stating he would live and die in the United States\u2014or possibly on Mars, which he described as 'part of America.'

His fortune, which began with $1 million after selling his early startup Zip2 in 1999 for $22 million, grew through founding PayPal, investing early in Tesla in 2004, and launching ambitious ventures like SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI.

His net worth has surged to $500 billion, making him the first person ever to reach that milestone. This growth is tied to Tesla's recovery, driven in part by Musk\u2019s renewed focus on the company after stepping back from certain U.S. government-related executive roles. A 2018 performance-based compensation plan could add up to $133 billion in additional shares if approved, though a Delaware judge canceled the plan in January 2025, citing unfair shareholder treatment. The case remains under appeal before the Delaware Supreme Court. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s board proposed a new executive compensation package in September 2025 that could grant Musk up to a trillion dollars in shares if the company meets ambitious growth targets over the next decade. Musk leads six major companies: Tesla (electric vehicles and energy), SpaceX (space travel and Starlink satellite internet), Neuralink (brain-computer interfaces), The Boring Company (infrastructure), X (formerly Twitter), and xAI (artificial intelligence). These ventures are seen as pivotal in shaping the future of transportation, space exploration, digital connectivity, renewable energy, and AI ethics. Tesla has accelerated the global shift to electric mobility and renewable energy, while SpaceX has reduced launch costs through reusable rockets and become a key partner for NASA. Starlink aims to close the digital divide by providing high-speed internet to remote areas. Neuralink and xAI represent Musk\u2019s long-term vision for human-machine integration and ethical AI development.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource:[quien.com](https://www.quien.com/espectaculos/2025/10/02/elon-musk-a-punto-de-romper-record-historico-podria-convertirse-en-el-primer-trillonario-de-la-historia)\n\n**Elon Musk Approaches the Milestone of Becoming the World's First Trillionaire**\nElon Musk became the first person to briefly reach a net worth of $500.1 billion on October 2, 2025, according to the Real Time Billionaires tracker, before his wealth slightly declined to $499.1 billion.

Tesla's stock closed at $459.46 on Wednesday, its highest level since December 24, 2021. On September 10, 2025, Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle (ORCL.US), briefly surpassed Musk in net worth due to a stock surge driven by strong earnings, reaching $405 billion. However, by the end of the day, Musk's net worth rebounded to $384 billion, slightly ahead of Ellison's $383 billion. Despite this, Ellison's wealth rose by $148 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, making him the top-gaining billionaire and securing second place globally. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Meta (META.US), saw his wealth grow to $258 billion due to a 23% stock increase, placing him third. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon (AMZN.US), saw only a 1.2% stock gain, with investor concerns over AWS market share and a $100 million AI capital expenditure plan, keeping his net worth at $243 billion and dropping to fourth. Meanwhile, Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, saw his wealth fall by $5 billion due to a 6% decline in luxury goods demand, dropping from fifth to eighth. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, saw his net worth decline from $159 billion to $122 billion after announcing a $200 billion donation pledge over 20 years in May 2025, falling from ninth to fifteenth place.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 11:37 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/hkstock/hkstocknews/2025-10-03/doc-infsqhuu5487015.shtml)\n\n**Elon Musk on the Brink of Historic Milestone: Could Become First Trillionaire in History**\nElon Musk is on the verge of becoming the first trillionaire in history, according to reports from quien.com. His net worth has surged to $500 billion, making him the first person ever to reach that milestone. This growth is tied to Tesla's recovery, driven in part by Musk\u2019s renewed focus on the company after stepping back from certain U.S. government-related executive roles. A 2018 performance-based compensation plan could add up to $133 billion in additional shares if approved, though a Delaware judge canceled the plan in January 2025, citing unfair shareholder treatment. The case remains under appeal before the Delaware Supreme Court. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s board proposed a new executive compensation package in September 2025 that could grant Musk up to a trillion dollars in shares if the company meets ambitious growth targets over the next decade. Musk leads six major companies: Tesla (electric vehicles and energy), SpaceX (space travel and Starlink satellite internet), Neuralink (brain-computer interfaces), The Boring Company (infrastructure), X (formerly Twitter), and xAI (artificial intelligence). These ventures are seen as pivotal in shaping the future of transportation, space exploration, digital connectivity, renewable energy, and AI ethics. Tesla has accelerated the global shift to electric mobility and renewable energy, while SpaceX has reduced launch costs through reusable rockets and become a key partner for NASA. Starlink aims to close the digital divide by providing high-speed internet to remote areas. Neuralink and xAI represent Musk\u2019s long-term vision for human-machine integration and ethical AI development.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource:[quien.com](https://www.quien.com/espectaculos/2025/10/02/elon-musk-a-punto-de-romper-record-historico-podria-convertirse-en-el-primer-trillonario-de-la-historia)\n\n**Elon Musk may become World's First Trillionaire; Check 2025 Richest People list - Pakistan Observer**\nElon Musk has become the first person in history to reach a net worth of $459 billion, according to the 2025 World Richest Persons list published by Pakistan Observer. This milestone, confirmed by Forbes\u2019 Real-Time Billionaires tracker, places Musk $150 billion ahead of second-place Larry Ellison, who has a net worth of $340 billion. Musk\u2019s wealth surge is driven by three major ventures: Tesla, which contributed an estimated $9.3 billion in value after a 4% stock increase; SpaceX, valued at $400 billion with Musk owning a 42% stake worth $168 billion; and xAI Holdings, a merged AI venture with X (formerly Twitter), valued at $113 billion and worth $60 billion to Musk due to his 53% ownership. Musk\u2019s rise has been rapid: from $24.6 billion in March 2020, he crossed $100 billion in August 2020, became the world\u2019s richest person in January 2021, and reached $400 billion by December 2024. The first trillionaire in history may be within reach by March 2033, when the initial vesting date of Musk\u2019s $1 trillion Tesla pay package occurs. Despite his immense wealth, Musk has expressed greater focus on control than on financial metrics. The 2025 ranking lists Musk at No. 1, followed by Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg ($258B), Jeff Bezos ($243B), Larry Page ($213B), Sergey Brin ($200B), Steve Ballmer ($178B), Bernard Arnault ($172B), Jensen Huang ($162B), and Warren Buffett ($151B).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[pakobserver.net](https://pakobserver.net/elon-musk-may-become-worlds-first-trillionaire-check-2025-richest-people-list/)\n\n**Elon Musk Nears Historic Milestone as First Trillionaire in the World - Albidaoui**\nElon Musk, the world's richest person, is approaching the milestone of becoming the first trillionaire, according to Forbes, which reported on October 2, 2025. Musk's net worth reached $500.1 billion on Wednesday, briefly surpassing $500 billion, before falling to $499.1 billion, as tracked by Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires Observatory. This surge was driven by a rebound in Tesla's stock price following a brief foray into politics. Musk is followed in the Forbes list by Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, with a net worth of $350.7 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, with $245.8 billion. Musk, born in South Africa, earned his first millions in 1999 by selling his online publishing software company to Compaq for over $300 million. He later co-founded PayPal before leaving, then founded SpaceX in 2002 and became chairman of Tesla\u2019s board in 2004 after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and leaving Stanford University.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[albidaoui.ma](https://albidaoui.ma/169966.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Becomes Richest Person in History Despite Trump Rift and Tesla Struggles**\nElon Musk has become the first person in history to reach an estimated net worth of $500 billion, according to Forbes, despite a public rift with former U.S. President Donald Trump and ongoing challenges at Tesla. His wealth, primarily derived from equity in Tesla and SpaceX, was estimated at $499.1 billion by Forbes shortly after surpassing the $500 billion threshold. Bloomberg reported a slightly lower figure of $470 billion. Musk\u2019s wealth remains highly speculative due to the private nature of many of his ventures, including X (formerly Twitter), xAI, Neuralink, and SpaceX. The recent decline in Tesla\u2019s stock was attributed to Musk\u2019s controversial political associations and Trump\u2019s public distancing, which reportedly deterred some potential buyers. However, Tesla\u2019s stock rebounded as investors gained confidence in Musk\u2019s vision for future growth through robotaxis and AI-powered robots. A proposed incentive plan could grant Musk up to 423 million Tesla shares\u2014conditional on Tesla achieving an eightfold increase in market value within ten years, maintaining his leadership, deploying one million robotaxis, and delivering one million AI robots. The plan is set to be voted on by shareholders at the November annual meeting.

His net worth briefly peaked at $500 billion before falling to $470 billion by the end of the day, a $10.5 billion increase in a single day, driven by a 3.3% rise in Tesla shares and a further 0.7% gain in pre-market trading. Musk owns a 12\u201313% stake in Tesla, and future performance-based compensation could significantly increase his holdings, potentially making him a trillionaire if certain milestones are met. His wealth is bolstered by ownership of SpaceX, The Boring Company, and xAI, with some private ventures seeing higher valuations in 2025. Despite Tesla\u2019s challenges in European sales and rising competition from Chinese EV makers, its shares have risen over 70% in the past six months, though they remain slightly below the December 2024 record high. Musk briefly lost the title of the world\u2019s richest person to Larry Ellison of Oracle in early September, when Ellison\u2019s net worth briefly surged to $349 billion. However, Musk has since reclaimed the lead, with a $121 billion gap between them\u2014equal to Bill Gates\u2019 total net worth, who ranks 15th globally.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:17 AM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/elon-musk-trillionaire-tesla-net-worth-b2837778.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Becomes First Person in History to Surpass $500 Billion in Wealth -- Delo.ua**\nAccording to the Forbes Billionaires Index, Elon Musk became the first person in the world whose wealth briefly exceeded $500.1 billion on Wednesday afternoon in New York time, before slightly declining to just over $499 billion. This surge in Musk's net worth is linked to the rising stock price of Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer, which increased by nearly 4%, adding $9.3 billion to his wealth. Additionally, valuations of his other ventures\u2014xAI, a startup focused on artificial intelligence, and SpaceX, the aerospace company\u2014also rose. SpaceX is currently valued at $400 billion, while xAI, in which Musk owns 53% of shares, is valued at $60 billion. Forbes noted that this milestone further solidifies Musk's status as the richest person in the world, with a clear lead over other global tech leaders. Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, is the second-richest person globally with a net worth of approximately $350.7 billion. Ellison briefly surpassed Musk last month after Oracle's stock rose over 40% due to unexpectedly optimistic company forecasts in cloud infrastructure and AI-related deals. The top five richest people in the world also include Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Google co-founder Larry Page. Musk first became the world's richest person in 2021, later ceding the title to Bezos in the Bloomberg ranking, but reclaimed it last year. Musk's wealth sharply declined by over $200 billion at the end of 2022, but rebounded significantly after Donald Trump's presidential election victory, during which Musk was Trump's most prominent political donor. Following the election, Musk's net worth increased by $26.5 billion in a single day due to Tesla's stock rise. He previously became the first person to surpass the $400 billion wealth threshold.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 06:09 AM\nSource:[delo.ua](https://delo.ua/news/ilon-mask-stav-persoyu-lyudinoyu-v-sviti-cii-statok-perevishhiv-500-mlrd-dolariv-453222/)\n\n**Elon Musk Approaches the Milestone of Becoming the World's First Trillionaire**\nElon Musk became the first person to briefly reach a net worth of $500.1 billion on October 2, 2025, according to the Real Time Billionaires tracker, before his wealth slightly declined to $499.1 billion.

This places him ahead of Larry Ellison (US$ 341.8 billion), Mark Zuckerberg (US$ 205.2 billion), Jeff Bezos (US$ 196.8 billion), and other tech titans. Musk's wealth is anchored in a 12% stake in Tesla (with some shares pledged as collateral), a US$ 400 billion valuation for SpaceX based on an August acquisition offer, and an US$ 80 billion valuation for xAI. Despite a US$ 125 billion performance-based compensation package at Tesla being invalidated by a Delaware judge in January 2024 and currently under appeal\u2014leading Forbes to discount 50% of his stock options\u2014his net worth continues to grow. The surge was driven by a 33% rise in Tesla\u2019s stock, fueled by investor enthusiasm for AI and robotics initiatives, and Musk\u2019s US$ 1 billion stock purchase on September 12. Tesla is set to report its strongest quarterly results of the year, supported by a rush of U.S. buyers securing a US$ 7,500 EV tax credit before its expiration. Musk\u2019s ventures extend beyond Tesla: SpaceX advances orbital missions and Mars ambitions; xAI, focused on 'maximally truthful' AI, is seeking US$ 10 billion at a US$ 75 billion valuation and has partnered with Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock, and MGX to expand U.S. AI infrastructure; Neuralink plans a clinical trial in October to restore speech in paralyzed individuals via brain implants; The Boring Company signed a preliminary agreement with Dubai\u2019s Roads and Transport Authority to build the 'Dubai Loop', a network of underground autonomous vehicle tunnels; and Tesla secured a US$ 16.5 billion chip supply deal with Samsung to bolster U.S. semiconductor manufacturing for autonomous vehicles. Musk also proposed a new US$ 1 trillion performance-based compensation package for himself in September, tied to market cap, AI progress, and global expansion. In 2025, he is entering politics as co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency under President-elect Donald Trump, potentially influencing policies favorable to his ventures. Critics warn of concentrated economic and political power, but Musk remains driven by ambition: 'I want more money to do more impossible things,' echoing his past tweets. With wealth nearing US$ 500 billion, he aims for trillions to conquer stars, brains, and subterranean cities.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 08:47 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/protagonistas/elon-musk-sigue-siendo-el-hombre-mas-rico-del-mundo-pero-quiere-mas-dinero-a35.phtml)\n\n**Elon Musk Tops Global Rich List, Pavel Durov Emerges as Russia's Biggest Gainer in 2025**\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the world's 500 richest individuals were ranked at the end of the third quarter of 2025.

Twenty Russian billionaires were included in the list, with their collective wealth increasing by $19.69 billion in 2025. This growth is attributed to rising commodity prices and a global technology boom, which significantly boosted the value of shares in both Western tech firms and Russian assets. Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, contributed nearly a quarter of the $19.69 billion increase. His wealth stems from stakes in companies including Nordgold, 'Siburan', 'Lenta', TUI, 'Siliye Mashiny', USM Holdings (containing 'Metallloinvest', 'Udokan Copper', 'Megafon'), Novatek (24.6%), Sibur (30.6%), Renova Group (12.58% RusAl, 18.98% Oerlikon, 48.82% Sulzer), Polus (gold mining), Novatek (23.5%), Sibur (17%), Stroytransgaz (53%), Transoil (80%), Norilsk Nickel (37%), Rosbank (45%), T-Bank (35%), Lukoil (12%), Millhouse Capital, Evraz Plc, Yandex, Norilsk Nickel, Renaissance Insurance, NLMK, First Port Company, Monaco FC, and LetterOne Holdings (pre-2022).

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts, there is unanimous agreement that Elon Musk is extremely likely to be the richest person in the world on December 31, 2025. Experts from diverse backgrounds (financial analysis, corporate strategy, economics, business management, and sociology) highlight the same core points:\n\n1. Musk currently holds a very large lead (typically cited as $100\u2013150 billion) over his closest rivals (primarily Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg), based on both Bloomberg and Forbes indexes in October 2025.\n2. The bulk of Musk's net worth is tied to highly volatile assets (Tesla, SpaceX, xAI), making his wealth susceptible to sharp market moves, especially in Tesla stock. Nevertheless, the gap to competitors is so wide that only an extraordinary, rapid decline (e.g., a >30\u201340% drop in value) in his holdings, combined with a historic surge in a rival's assets, could overtake him in the short remaining time (2.5 months).\n3. There are modest downside risks cited: unresolved legal challenges over Musk\u2019s Tesla compensation, possible Bloomberg/Forbes methodology changes, potential exogenous market shocks, or an unprecedented, positive catalyst for a rival. However, the probability of these aligning\u2014and having enough impact to erase Musk's current margin\u2014is considered low within such a brief time frame.\n4. All forecasters cite the base rate (historically, the #1 wealth ranking is 'sticky' and rarely changes unless there is a catastrophic loss or blackout event) and find that both historical precedent and the current landscape support Musk\u2019s persistence at the top through year-end.\n5. The final assigned probabilities of Musk remaining the world\u2019s richest person on December 31, 2025, are all very high, ranging from 87% to 95%. Most position their probabilities in the upper 80s to low 90s, only discounting for the tail risk of a sudden extreme event or methodological quirk by the wealth rankings.\n\nIn summary, unless there is a sudden, severe, and unlikely collapse in Tesla/SpaceX or an unprecedented surge for a rival billionaire, Musk is overwhelmingly expected to remain the world\u2019s richest person at the end of 2025 according to Bloomberg (or Forbes, if needed).",
