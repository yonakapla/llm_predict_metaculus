The news flow confirms Musk's dominance, with his net worth at least $120 billion ahead of Ellison on Bloomberg's list, and even further ahead of Zuckerberg and others. While the risk of a negative swing is real, Musk's diversified exposure (EVs, space, AI, infrastructure) and the likelihood of at least one new or reinstated compensation windfall make the status quo path highly probable.

Several forecasters provided additional nuance reinforcing the resilience of the status quo: (1) the sheer magnitude of Musk's lead, (2) the absence of plausible near-term catalysts for a rival to overtake him, (3) the rarity of simultaneous dramatic upswings in rivals' assets and downswings in Musk's, and (4) the structural and network-based stickiness of elite wealth rankings. My initial assessment already strongly weighted these factors, but the deliberation made clear that the practical hurdles for Musk to lose the top spot are even greater than I originally described, and no plausible counterargument for a lower probability emerged. Therefore, I am revising my probability upward to more closely align with the consensus and the strength of the evidence.",

Critiques and defenses highlighted that the practical mechanics of billionaire rankings, elite inertia, and Musk's diversified, founder-led portfolio make a reversal exceedingly unlikely within three months. No new arguments or data emerged to suggest a significant increase in tail risk. Some forecasters used slightly higher probabilities (92\u201393%), but the modal consensus is in the high 80s to low 90s, with the main variance attributable to individual risk tolerance around black swan events. Given the collective emphasis on status quo persistence and the robustness of Musk's position, I see no justification for lowering my forecast, and while a slight increase could be defensible, the original 91% remains well-calibrated for a bold yet cautious stance.",

Several forecasters emphasized, with detailed historical perspective, that no immediate rival is close enough for even significant volatility to credibly threaten Musk's lead before year-end. While my original forecast incorporated elite inertia and structural supports, I weighted the possibility of a legal or methodological shock slightly more heavily than most peers. Their arguments, especially regarding the practical mechanics of billionaire rankings and the improbability of simultaneous, extreme negative and positive shocks among Musk and rivals, justify a modest upward revision. The only unresolved risks are black swan events or an unexpected, rapid, rival asset surge, both of which remain possible but exceedingly rare in this context.",

Additional perspectives from financial analysis, corporate governance, and elite theory all converged on the low likelihood of a reversal barring a simultaneous extreme negative shock to Musk and an extreme positive event for a rival, which is exceedingly rare. Critiques highlighted the importance of methodological differences in net worth calculation but found no credible near-term catalyst for Musk to lose his top spot. The network-centric view I advanced is further supported by recognition of Musk's ability to shape narratives and mobilize resources, adding resilience to his position. Given this, the slight remaining risk comes from market volatility or black swan events, but these do not warrant a change in forecast.

This milestone cements Musk as the most influential entrepreneur globally, driven by his impact on electric mobility, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. However, Bloomberg's Billionaires Index values his wealth at $470 billion, highlighting discrepancies in valuation methods\u2014particularly due to Musk's significant holdings in private companies like SpaceX and xAI, whose assets are not publicly traded. His net worth growth is directly tied to the expansion of Tesla and SpaceX, whose rising valuations have made previously unattainable milestones achievable. Despite the staggering figure, Musk\u2019s wealth is largely illiquid, consisting of stock holdings and hard-to-convert assets, representing potential rather than immediate cash. The announcement has sparked debate over economic inequality and the role of extreme wealth in society, with some praising Musk\u2019s innovation-driven progress and others criticizing the concentration of wealth amid deep social disparities. Nonetheless, the $500 billion threshold solidifies Musk as a central figure in the global economy and a defining force in 21st-century technological advancement.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 03:07 PM\nSource:[HSB Noticias](https://www.hsbnoticias.com/elon-musk-rompe-record-primer-ser-humano-en-superar-los-500-mil-millones-de-dolares/)\n\n**After Being Named 'The Richest Man in History,' Elon Musk Says He Might Move to Mars and Die There**\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX, has not ruled out spending his final days on Mars, stating he would live and die in the United States\u2014or possibly on Mars, which he described as 'part of America.'

Musk revealed that SpaceX plans to launch five uncrewed Starship spacecraft to Mars within the next two years, alongside future plans to send 'Optimus' robots developed by Tesla to the planet as part of a broader exploration initiative.

His fortune, which began with $1 million after selling his early startup Zip2 in 1999 for $22 million, grew through founding PayPal, investing early in Tesla in 2004, and launching ambitious ventures like SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI.

His net worth has surged to $500 billion, making him the first person ever to reach that milestone. This growth is tied to Tesla's recovery, driven in part by Musk\u2019s renewed focus on the company after stepping back from certain U.S. government-related executive roles. A 2018 performance-based compensation plan could add up to $133 billion in additional shares if approved, though a Delaware judge canceled the plan in January 2025, citing unfair shareholder treatment. The case remains under appeal before the Delaware Supreme Court. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s board proposed a new executive compensation package in September 2025 that could grant Musk up to a trillion dollars in shares if the company meets ambitious growth targets over the next decade. Musk leads six major companies: Tesla (electric vehicles and energy), SpaceX (space travel and Starlink satellite internet), Neuralink (brain-computer interfaces), The Boring Company (infrastructure), X (formerly Twitter), and xAI (artificial intelligence). These ventures are seen as pivotal in shaping the future of transportation, space exploration, digital connectivity, renewable energy, and AI ethics. Tesla has accelerated the global shift to electric mobility and renewable energy, while SpaceX has reduced launch costs through reusable rockets and become a key partner for NASA. Starlink aims to close the digital divide by providing high-speed internet to remote areas. Neuralink and xAI represent Musk\u2019s long-term vision for human-machine integration and ethical AI development.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource:[quien.com](https://www.quien.com/espectaculos/2025/10/02/elon-musk-a-punto-de-romper-record-historico-podria-convertirse-en-el-primer-trillonario-de-la-historia)\n\n**Elon Musk Approaches the Milestone of Becoming the World's First Trillionaire**\nElon Musk became the first person to briefly reach a net worth of $500.1 billion on October 2, 2025, according to the Real Time Billionaires tracker, before his wealth slightly declined to $499.1 billion.

This milestone, confirmed by Forbes\u2019 Real-Time Billionaires tracker, places Musk $150 billion ahead of second-place Larry Ellison, who has a net worth of $340 billion. Musk\u2019s wealth surge is driven by three major ventures: Tesla, which contributed an estimated $9.3 billion in value after a 4% stock increase; SpaceX, valued at $400 billion with Musk owning a 42% stake worth $168 billion; and xAI Holdings, a merged AI venture with X (formerly Twitter), valued at $113 billion and worth $60 billion to Musk due to his 53% ownership. Musk\u2019s rise has been rapid: from $24.6 billion in March 2020, he crossed $100 billion in August 2020, became the world\u2019s richest person in January 2021, and reached $400 billion by December 2024. The first trillionaire in history may be within reach by March 2033, when the initial vesting date of Musk\u2019s $1 trillion Tesla pay package occurs. Despite his immense wealth, Musk has expressed greater focus on control than on financial metrics. The 2025 ranking lists Musk at No. 1, followed by Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg ($258B), Jeff Bezos ($243B), Larry Page ($213B), Sergey Brin ($200B), Steve Ballmer ($178B), Bernard Arnault ($172B), Jensen Huang ($162B), and Warren Buffett ($151B).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[pakobserver.net](https://pakobserver.net/elon-musk-may-become-worlds-first-trillionaire-check-2025-richest-people-list/)\n\n**Elon Musk Nears Historic Milestone as First Trillionaire in the World - Albidaoui**\nElon Musk, the world's richest person, is approaching the milestone of becoming the first trillionaire, according to Forbes, which reported on October 2, 2025. Musk's net worth reached $500.1 billion on Wednesday, briefly surpassing $500 billion, before falling to $499.1 billion, as tracked by Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires Observatory. This surge was driven by a rebound in Tesla's stock price following a brief foray into politics. Musk is followed in the Forbes list by Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, with a net worth of $350.7 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, with $245.8 billion. Musk, born in South Africa, earned his first millions in 1999 by selling his online publishing software company to Compaq for over $300 million. He later co-founded PayPal before leaving, then founded SpaceX in 2002 and became chairman of Tesla\u2019s board in 2004 after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and leaving Stanford University.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[albidaoui.ma](https://albidaoui.ma/169966.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Becomes Richest Person in History Despite Trump Rift and Tesla Struggles**\nElon Musk has become the first person in history to reach an estimated net worth of $500 billion, according to Forbes, despite a public rift with former U.S. President Donald Trump and ongoing challenges at Tesla. His wealth, primarily derived from equity in Tesla and SpaceX, was estimated at $499.1 billion by Forbes shortly after surpassing the $500 billion threshold. Bloomberg reported a slightly lower figure of $470 billion. Musk\u2019s wealth remains highly speculative due to the private nature of many of his ventures, including X (formerly Twitter), xAI, Neuralink, and SpaceX. The recent decline in Tesla\u2019s stock was attributed to Musk\u2019s controversial political associations and Trump\u2019s public distancing, which reportedly deterred some potential buyers. However, Tesla\u2019s stock rebounded as investors gained confidence in Musk\u2019s vision for future growth through robotaxis and AI-powered robots. A proposed incentive plan could grant Musk up to 423 million Tesla shares\u2014conditional on Tesla achieving an eightfold increase in market value within ten years, maintaining his leadership, deploying one million robotaxis, and delivering one million AI robots. The plan is set to be voted on by shareholders at the November annual meeting.

His net worth briefly peaked at $500 billion before falling to $470 billion by the end of the day, a $10.5 billion increase in a single day, driven by a 3.3% rise in Tesla shares and a further 0.7% gain in pre-market trading. Musk owns a 12\u201313% stake in Tesla, and future performance-based compensation could significantly increase his holdings, potentially making him a trillionaire if certain milestones are met. His wealth is bolstered by ownership of SpaceX, The Boring Company, and xAI, with some private ventures seeing higher valuations in 2025. Despite Tesla\u2019s challenges in European sales and rising competition from Chinese EV makers, its shares have risen over 70% in the past six months, though they remain slightly below the December 2024 record high. Musk briefly lost the title of the world\u2019s richest person to Larry Ellison of Oracle in early September, when Ellison\u2019s net worth briefly surged to $349 billion. However, Musk has since reclaimed the lead, with a $121 billion gap between them\u2014equal to Bill Gates\u2019 total net worth, who ranks 15th globally.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:17 AM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/elon-musk-trillionaire-tesla-net-worth-b2837778.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Becomes First Person in History to Surpass $500 Billion in Wealth -- Delo.ua**\nAccording to the Forbes Billionaires Index, Elon Musk became the first person in the world whose wealth briefly exceeded $500.1 billion on Wednesday afternoon in New York time, before slightly declining to just over $499 billion. This surge in Musk's net worth is linked to the rising stock price of Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer, which increased by nearly 4%, adding $9.3 billion to his wealth. Additionally, valuations of his other ventures\u2014xAI, a startup focused on artificial intelligence, and SpaceX, the aerospace company\u2014also rose. SpaceX is currently valued at $400 billion, while xAI, in which Musk owns 53% of shares, is valued at $60 billion. Forbes noted that this milestone further solidifies Musk's status as the richest person in the world, with a clear lead over other global tech leaders. Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, is the second-richest person globally with a net worth of approximately $350.7 billion. Ellison briefly surpassed Musk last month after Oracle's stock rose over 40% due to unexpectedly optimistic company forecasts in cloud infrastructure and AI-related deals. The top five richest people in the world also include Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Google co-founder Larry Page. Musk first became the world's richest person in 2021, later ceding the title to Bezos in the Bloomberg ranking, but reclaimed it last year. Musk's wealth sharply declined by over $200 billion at the end of 2022, but rebounded significantly after Donald Trump's presidential election victory, during which Musk was Trump's most prominent political donor. Following the election, Musk's net worth increased by $26.5 billion in a single day due to Tesla's stock rise. He previously became the first person to surpass the $400 billion wealth threshold.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 06:09 AM\nSource:[delo.ua](https://delo.ua/news/ilon-mask-stav-persoyu-lyudinoyu-v-sviti-cii-statok-perevishhiv-500-mlrd-dolariv-453222/)\n\n**Elon Musk Approaches the Milestone of Becoming the World's First Trillionaire**\nElon Musk became the first person to briefly reach a net worth of $500.1 billion on October 2, 2025, according to the Real Time Billionaires tracker, before his wealth slightly declined to $499.1 billion.

This places him ahead of Larry Ellison (US$ 341.8 billion), Mark Zuckerberg (US$ 205.2 billion), Jeff Bezos (US$ 196.8 billion), and other tech titans. Musk's wealth is anchored in a 12% stake in Tesla (with some shares pledged as collateral), a US$ 400 billion valuation for SpaceX based on an August acquisition offer, and an US$ 80 billion valuation for xAI. Despite a US$ 125 billion performance-based compensation package at Tesla being invalidated by a Delaware judge in January 2024 and currently under appeal\u2014leading Forbes to discount 50% of his stock options\u2014his net worth continues to grow. The surge was driven by a 33% rise in Tesla\u2019s stock, fueled by investor enthusiasm for AI and robotics initiatives, and Musk\u2019s US$ 1 billion stock purchase on September 12. Tesla is set to report its strongest quarterly results of the year, supported by a rush of U.S. buyers securing a US$ 7,500 EV tax credit before its expiration. Musk\u2019s ventures extend beyond Tesla: SpaceX advances orbital missions and Mars ambitions; xAI, focused on 'maximally truthful' AI, is seeking US$ 10 billion at a US$ 75 billion valuation and has partnered with Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock, and MGX to expand U.S. AI infrastructure; Neuralink plans a clinical trial in October to restore speech in paralyzed individuals via brain implants; The Boring Company signed a preliminary agreement with Dubai\u2019s Roads and Transport Authority to build the 'Dubai Loop', a network of underground autonomous vehicle tunnels; and Tesla secured a US$ 16.5 billion chip supply deal with Samsung to bolster U.S. semiconductor manufacturing for autonomous vehicles. Musk also proposed a new US$ 1 trillion performance-based compensation package for himself in September, tied to market cap, AI progress, and global expansion. In 2025, he is entering politics as co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency under President-elect Donald Trump, potentially influencing policies favorable to his ventures. Critics warn of concentrated economic and political power, but Musk remains driven by ambition: 'I want more money to do more impossible things,' echoing his past tweets. With wealth nearing US$ 500 billion, he aims for trillions to conquer stars, brains, and subterranean cities.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 08:47 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/protagonistas/elon-musk-sigue-siendo-el-hombre-mas-rico-del-mundo-pero-quiere-mas-dinero-a35.phtml)\n\n**Elon Musk Tops Global Rich List, Pavel Durov Emerges as Russia's Biggest Gainer in 2025**\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the world's 500 richest individuals were ranked at the end of the third quarter of 2025.

Twenty Russian billionaires were included in the list, with their collective wealth increasing by $19.69 billion in 2025. This growth is attributed to rising commodity prices and a global technology boom, which significantly boosted the value of shares in both Western tech firms and Russian assets. Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, contributed nearly a quarter of the $19.69 billion increase. His wealth stems from stakes in companies including Nordgold, 'Siburan', 'Lenta', TUI, 'Siliye Mashiny', USM Holdings (containing 'Metallloinvest', 'Udokan Copper', 'Megafon'), Novatek (24.6%), Sibur (30.6%), Renova Group (12.58% RusAl, 18.98% Oerlikon, 48.82% Sulzer), Polus (gold mining), Novatek (23.5%), Sibur (17%), Stroytransgaz (53%), Transoil (80%), Norilsk Nickel (37%), Rosbank (45%), T-Bank (35%), Lukoil (12%), Millhouse Capital, Evraz Plc, Yandex, Norilsk Nickel, Renaissance Insurance, NLMK, First Port Company, Monaco FC, and LetterOne Holdings (pre-2022).

    "summary": "All expert forecasters expect Elon Musk will remain the world's richest person on December 31, 2025, assigning very high (but not absolute) probabilities to this outcome. Forecasters from financial analysis, economics, business management, corporate strategy, and sociology perspectives agree Musk's current lead over rivals (notably Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg) is historically large\u2014typically at least $100\u2013150 billion\u2014making displacement in under three months extremely unlikely absent a catastrophic or unprecedented event. \n\nKey factors cited that support Musk\u2019s dominance include: (1) the base rate of stability at the top of billionaire rankings (turnover is rare over short periods), (2) robust performance and high current valuations for Tesla and SpaceX, (3) Musk's centrality and influence in technological, innovation, and investor networks, and (4) his continued ability to attract large compensation packages and market enthusiasm. \n\nRisks to Musk's position were acknowledged, notably the high volatility of Tesla shares, illiquidity and revaluation risks of private holdings (SpaceX, xAI), ongoing legal challenges (especially regarding compensation packages), broader market shocks, and potential breakthroughs by rivals. Despite these, no immediate threats or signals indicate a reversal large enough to dethrone Musk, and legal or regulatory risks are not positioned for resolution before year-end.\n\nProbability estimates from experts clustered tightly in the 88\u201393% range. The consensus scenario for a 'No' outcome involves a unique, severe crash in Tesla\u2019s value or a black swan event (regulatory action, health crisis, forced asset sale, or a rival's company experiencing a massive positive shock), none of which currently appear likely. The status quo\u2014Musk maintaining or increasing his lead\u2014remains highly favored given present conditions. Group chat and cross-perspective analysis further reinforced the stickiness of Musk\u2019s top ranking over the final quarter of 2025.",
