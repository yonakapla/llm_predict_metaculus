However, powerful domestic opposition, legal/procedural hurdles, and the low base rate of such bailouts are significant headwinds. The most likely path to resolution is either a modest, face-saving draw on a swap line or a small bridge loan, possibly after the October elections but before year-end.

The resolution criteria are broad: even a drawn swap line counts. Given the acute pressure on the peso, elections in late October, and the short time horizon to resolution, the probability of at least one qualifying action (swap line drawn, loan, or bond purchase) before year-end is high but not certain. The main ways this fails to happen are if the US delays or restricts action due to domestic politics, or if Argentina manages to muddle through with IMF/Chinese/market interventions alone.

However, strong domestic opposition, especially from agriculture lobbies and both parties in Congress, creates a meaningful barrier to action\u2014particularly for a direct, visible bailout outside the IMF framework. The logistical and legal hurdles\u2014especially for ESF or swap-line use\u2014are non-trivial, and the administration may seek to delay or obfuscate action until after the US and Argentine elections. Still, the acute instability, very public US-Treasury signaling, and the narrow window before 2026 mean that a financial rescue (swap line drawdown, dollar loan, or bond purchase) remains plausible, particularly if the crisis worsens. While not a lock, the probability is substantially above base rates due to the unique alignment of executive will, crisis severity, and geopolitical context.

However, several factors push probability upward: the clear announcement of a $20 billion swap line, the acute and worsening crisis, and the strong personal and ideological alignment between Trump and Milei. Nevertheless, there remains significant domestic political opposition, and both Trump and Treasury have publicly hedged their language, emphasizing 'help' rather than a formal bailout. Liberal institutionalism, which prioritizes multilateral over unilateral action, suggests the US will continue to prefer IMF-led solutions, and the ambiguity in reporting to date suggests that, unless the crisis sharply worsens, the US is likely to delay or avoid a formal qualifying action. Still, the risk of a last-minute crisis and the political temptation to deliver a high-profile rescue cannot be dismissed. Weighing these factors, the probability is above the base rate but not at an extreme; the most likely scenario is ongoing ambiguity and IMF-led action, but a 30% chance remains for a qualifying US action before year-end.",

The announced swap line is significant, but unless the BCRA draws on it or direct funds are transferred, the resolution criteria for a 'Yes' are not met. Given market and political pressures, the probability of the US crossing the threshold and providing at least a swap draw or direct transfer before 2026 is moderately high, but not overwhelming, especially as the US may prefer to string out ambiguity for leverage or to avoid pre-midterm backlash.

In addition, you may overestimate the willingness of the Trump administration to absorb domestic political costs for a bailout that, while important to Milei, is not existential for US interests. The risk of last-minute political or bureaucratic delay, or of the US relying on further IMF or rhetorical support while avoiding a qualifying action, is higher than your probability suggests. While the chance of a token rescue is real, a probability in the high 60s or low 70s may be excessive given the persistent institutional and political obstacles."

Realist analysis is particularly attuned to the way strategic interests can override institutional inertia in moments of crisis, and the US has a pattern of bending precedent when key interests are threatened (e.g., Mexico 1994-95). You also acknowledge that domestic opposition is a real constraint, but not necessarily a veto; the executive can act unilaterally in a crisis. Thus, your mid-60s probability, while higher than my own, is solidly reasoned given the alignment of acute risk, strong signaling, and strategic motivation."

Your analysis properly weighs the likelihood that, despite Congressional resistance and some ambiguity in official statements, the US executive will find a path (even if minor or face-saving, such as a small swap draw) to provide qualifying support if crisis pressure intensifies post-election.

The most likely path to a qualifying US action remains a crisis-driven swap line draw or loan, which is not certain given the current ambiguity and domestic opposition.

However, the breadth of the resolution criteria (even a single swap line draw suffices), the unique context of US-Argentine alignment, and the operational readiness for intervention tip the scale toward a higher probability. The Liberal Institutionalism and IPE perspectives rightly highlight the risk of ambiguity and delays, but underweight the cost of inaction after such public commitments.

However, critiques of higher probabilities point to robust domestic opposition, the US preference for IMF-led solutions, and a genuine risk of last-minute walk-back or delay. The resolution criteria are broad (any draw on a swap line or bond purchase suffices), and the risk of a last-minute, face-saving intervention is nontrivial, but not overwhelming.

Repeatedly receiving IMF loans, the crisis culminated at the [turn of the millennium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%932002_Argentine_great_depression) and resulted in a majority of the population living below the poverty line. Following the crisis, Argentina underwent [debt restructuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring) and economic reforms, however economic problems persisted and by 2023 inflation had once again [surpassed 100%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-64960385).\n\nIn the [2023 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Argentine_general_election), [Javier Milei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei) was elected President of Argentina. Milei campaign on a platform of [radical economic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei_2023_presidential_campaign) and free market policies, including dollarizing the economy, abolishing the Central Bank, and privatizing state-owned enterprises. Following the election, Milei faced political pressure and challenges and moderated his proposals, however significant economic reforms were still implemented.\n\nDuring Milei's tenure, Argentina's economy has continued to face significant challenges. Although poverty has dropped from its peak, many have lost access to basic needs programs, and although inflation declined following an initial spike, it remains far above normal levels.&#x20;\n\nPrior to Milei's presidency, Argentina had implemented significant currency controls, resulting in a split between the formal and informal rate of the Argentine Peso. Milei initially attempted to unify the exchange rate with a \u201ccrawling peg\u201d system before eventually allowing the peso to [float freely](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/04/12/argentina-to-lift-strict-currency-controls-on-monday_6740130_4.html).

This would allow Argentina to exchange pesos for U.S dollars with the U.S central bank, giving it the ability to defend the peso\u2019s exchange rate and receive short term funding. Following this, Trump [downplayed the plans](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250923-we-re-gonna-help-trump-to-the-rescue-of-struggling-argentina) saying \"I don't think they need a bailout\" but touted unspecified \"help\" to Argentina.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40031,\"question_id\":39572}}`",

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Can Trump save Argentina's crisis-stricken economy as he hopes?**\nFollowing a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 24, 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed Argentine President Javier Milei as a 'truly fantastic and powerful leader,' marking a rare public endorsement. The next day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced close coordination with Milei and pledged a 'large' financial intervention to stabilize Argentina\u2019s economy, including a potential $20 billion credit line, bond purchases, and central bank currency swaps. This support came amid a severe economic crisis: Argentina\u2019s peso fell 6% in a single day on October 1, 2025, its largest drop since September 8, forcing the government to sell $1 billion in foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. The central bank had already spent $1 billion by September 19 to keep the peso within its exchange-rate band, which limits daily fluctuations against the dollar. Milei, a far-right libertarian elected in November 2023, had implemented austerity measures\u2014cutting subsidies, slashing public payrolls, and reducing ministries\u2014leading inflation to drop from 211% to 37% in a year. However, economic activity stalled, unemployment rose, and public approval fell from 48% in July to 41% in mid-September. Political setbacks included a provincial election loss, a corruption scandal involving his sister, and Congress overturning his vetoes on health and education funding. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) launched its 23rd program in April 2024, underpinning the peso\u2019s floating exchange rate. Despite Bessent\u2019s announcement, the peso dropped again by 6% on October 1, closing at 1,380 per dollar. Analysts, including Andres Abadia of Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that U.S. support has strengthened Argentina\u2019s international reserves and eased default risk, but described the aid as a 'bridge to the election' rather than a long-term solution. The intervention is expected to delay a peso devaluation until after the October 26 mid-term elections, when Milei seeks to strengthen his Libertad Levanza Party\u2019s position in Congress. Experts warn that if Milei performs poorly, inflation risks will rise and financial instability could return. Bessent\u2019s pledge marks the second major U.S.-backed bailout for Argentina under Trump, following a $50 billion IMF deal for Mauricio Macri in 2018. According to Abadia, the aid is a 'lifeline, but not a panacea,' and the underlying economic and political challenges remain unresolved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/1/can-trump-save-argentinas-crisis-stricken-economy-as-he-hopes)\n\n**The U.S. Should Not Bail Out Argentina**\nArgentina is facing another financial crisis, having borrowed $20 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2024 with promises of reform, though the IMF's chief endorsed President Javier Milei's party without ensuring the implementation of his unstable economic plans. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the Trump administration was prepared to 'do what is needed' to support Argentina ahead of its October 2024 legislative elections, sparking bipartisan backlash. The move is controversial because U.S. soybean farmers face their worst financial outlook in decades after China shifted soybean purchases from the U.S. to Argentina, especially following a tax holiday in Argentina that boosted imports. Milei\u2019s radical austerity measures\u2014symbolized by a chainsaw gift to Elon Musk\u2014failed to resolve Argentina\u2019s deep economic issues, including a 33% poverty rate and a projected recession. His overvalued peso benefits the wealthy but harms exports, while Chinese imports surged 80% in the first half of 2024. Despite his ideological alignment with Trump, Milei\u2019s popularity is declining, with his party facing low poll numbers. A U.S. bailout via the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) would be unprecedented and unjustified, as Argentina\u2019s financial problems do not threaten U.S. dollar stability. Such a bailout would primarily benefit hedge funds and speculators who bet on Milei\u2019s failed reforms, inflating asset values without fostering long-term growth. The Treasury\u2019s use of the ESF for political or ideological reasons would bypass congressional oversight and risk public trust, especially after past overreach during the 2008 crisis. U.S. farmers, already suffering from inflation, worker shortages, and retaliatory tariffs, are protesting the bailout, with small-farm bankruptcies at a five-year high. Even some Republicans, like Senator Chuck Grassley, oppose the move. While Argentina produces critical minerals like lithium, the Treasury is not justifying intervention on that basis. The article argues the U.S. should reject the bailout, instead focusing on aiding struggling American farmers and consumers, reforming the misuse of the ESF, and pursuing strategic economic partnerships in Latin America through trade, development finance, and supply chain investments\u2014not bailouts for politically connected leaders. The IMF is also criticized for promoting austerity that benefits global investors over local populations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:51 AM\nSource:[Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/01/the-u-s-should-not-bail-out-argentina/)\n\n**Milei\u2019s Dollar Crisis: A Fragile Economy on the Brink of Collapse**\nArgentina's economy under President Javier Milei is facing a severe dollar shortage, with nearly $18 billion in dollar purchases since mid-April 2024 following the relaxation of the 'cepo' (currency controls) for individuals. Despite a $14 billion disbursement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a $20 billion agreement\u2014only five months after the initial bailout\u2014reserves continue to decline. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, issued three supportive posts on X (formerly Twitter) to stabilize confidence, but these have not attracted sufficient foreign investment. The upcoming meeting between Milei and Donald Trump on October 14, 2025, just before U.S. midterm elections, is seen as a political gesture rather than a financial commitment. The Central Bank of Argentina, led by Santiago Bausili, has taken emergency measures, including banning banks from acting as intermediaries for dollar transactions via digital wallets (Ual\u00e1, Mercado Pago) and brokerage firms (Cocos), citing regulatory authority. These actions reflect desperation amid accelerating dollar demand and dwindling reserves. The government\u2019s economic strategy, led by Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank President Bausili, has failed to build a dollar buffer ahead of the October 26 election. Despite transferring $1.5 billion in agricultural export gains to agribusinesses, the Treasury only retained $2.5 billion of $7 billion in declared foreign sales, with the rest absorbed by speculative demand. As a result, bond yields have fallen and the risk premium rose to 1,230 points. The IMF is expected to demand structural reforms and devaluation post-election. The article argues that Milei\u2019s government lacks political anchoring, with its economic model relying on unsustainable financial speculation and external support.

Despite a significant drop in poverty\u2014from 52.9% in early 2024 to 31.6% a year later, according to Argentina\u2019s National Institute of Statistics (Indec)\u2014and a sharp decline in inflation\u2014from 211% in 2023 to 117.8% in 2024, with the monthly rate falling to 1.9% in August 2025, his popularity has declined from 55% approval in July to 58% disapproval in September, according to a Universidad de San Andr\u00e9s survey. Milei\u2019s party, La Libertad Avanza, suffered a major setback in the Buenos Aires provincial elections, losing by 14 points to the Peronist opposition, a strategic blow just one month before the national vote. His economic reforms, which include slashing public spending, eliminating export taxes on agricultural products, and securing a potential $20 billion swap agreement with the U.S. Treasury, are under strain due to a 17% depreciation of the peso over three months and a $1 billion loss in central bank reserves. The government has also faced a credibility crisis after audio recordings revealed a suspected bribery scheme involving Karina Milei, the president\u2019s sister and secretary general of the presidency, at the National Disability Agency. Milei has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated. Despite these challenges, Milei continues to promote his vision of economic freedom, declaring on X: 'Vive la libert\u00e9, bordel!' and asserting that 'the worst is behind us.' However, analysts like Ignacio Labaqui warn that if the campaign is led by the same figures responsible for the provincial defeat, the government could face serious legislative obstacles. With $28 billion in debt due by mid-2026 and foreign direct investment down 90% in Q1 2025 to just over \u20ac500 million, the sustainability of Milei\u2019s 'liberal revolution' remains uncertain. The coming weeks will determine whether his reforms can survive both electoral scrutiny and economic reality.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 03:16 PM\nSource:[Le Point.fr](https://www.lepoint.fr/monde/l-argentine-de-milei-en-proie-aux-turbulences-a-un-mois-des-legislatives-30-09-2025-2599970_24.php)\n\n**The light and shadows of Argentina's 'chainsaw reform'**\nArgentina\u2019s economy, once beset by 211\u202f% inflation and a weak peso, experienced a sharp turnaround after libertarian economist Javier\u202fMilei took office in December\u202f2023.

The next day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced close coordination with Milei and pledged a 'large' financial intervention to stabilize Argentina\u2019s economy, including a potential $20 billion credit line, bond purchases, and central bank currency swaps. This support came amid a severe economic crisis: Argentina\u2019s peso fell 6% in a single day on October 1, 2025, its largest drop since September 8, forcing the government to sell $1 billion in foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. The central bank had already spent $1 billion by September 19 to keep the peso within its exchange-rate band, which limits daily fluctuations against the dollar. Milei, a far-right libertarian elected in November 2023, had implemented austerity measures\u2014cutting subsidies, slashing public payrolls, and reducing ministries\u2014leading inflation to drop from 211% to 37% in a year. However, economic activity stalled, unemployment rose, and public approval fell from 48% in July to 41% in mid-September. Political setbacks included a provincial election loss, a corruption scandal involving his sister, and Congress overturning his vetoes on health and education funding. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) launched its 23rd program in April 2024, underpinning the peso\u2019s floating exchange rate. Despite Bessent\u2019s announcement, the peso dropped again by 6% on October 1, closing at 1,380 per dollar. Analysts, including Andres Abadia of Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that U.S. support has strengthened Argentina\u2019s international reserves and eased default risk, but described the aid as a 'bridge to the election' rather than a long-term solution. The intervention is expected to delay a peso devaluation until after the October 26 mid-term elections, when Milei seeks to strengthen his Libertad Levanza Party\u2019s position in Congress. Experts warn that if Milei performs poorly, inflation risks will rise and financial instability could return. Bessent\u2019s pledge marks the second major U.S.-backed bailout for Argentina under Trump, following a $50 billion IMF deal for Mauricio Macri in 2018. According to Abadia, the aid is a 'lifeline, but not a panacea,' and the underlying economic and political challenges remain unresolved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/1/can-trump-save-argentinas-crisis-stricken-economy-as-he-hopes)\n\n**The U.S. Should Not Bail Out Argentina**\nArgentina is facing another financial crisis, having borrowed $20 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2024 with promises of reform, though the IMF's chief endorsed President Javier Milei's party without ensuring the implementation of his unstable economic plans. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the Trump administration was prepared to 'do what is needed' to support Argentina ahead of its October 2024 legislative elections, sparking bipartisan backlash. The move is controversial because U.S. soybean farmers face their worst financial outlook in decades after China shifted soybean purchases from the U.S. to Argentina, especially following a tax holiday in Argentina that boosted imports. Milei\u2019s radical austerity measures\u2014symbolized by a chainsaw gift to Elon Musk\u2014failed to resolve Argentina\u2019s deep economic issues, including a 33% poverty rate and a projected recession. His overvalued peso benefits the wealthy but harms exports, while Chinese imports surged 80% in the first half of 2024. Despite his ideological alignment with Trump, Milei\u2019s popularity is declining, with his party facing low poll numbers. A U.S. bailout via the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) would be unprecedented and unjustified, as Argentina\u2019s financial problems do not threaten U.S. dollar stability. Such a bailout would primarily benefit hedge funds and speculators who bet on Milei\u2019s failed reforms, inflating asset values without fostering long-term growth. The Treasury\u2019s use of the ESF for political or ideological reasons would bypass congressional oversight and risk public trust, especially after past overreach during the 2008 crisis. U.S. farmers, already suffering from inflation, worker shortages, and retaliatory tariffs, are protesting the bailout, with small-farm bankruptcies at a five-year high. Even some Republicans, like Senator Chuck Grassley, oppose the move. While Argentina produces critical minerals like lithium, the Treasury is not justifying intervention on that basis. The article argues the U.S. should reject the bailout, instead focusing on aiding struggling American farmers and consumers, reforming the misuse of the ESF, and pursuing strategic economic partnerships in Latin America through trade, development finance, and supply chain investments\u2014not bailouts for politically connected leaders. The IMF is also criticized for promoting austerity that benefits global investors over local populations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:51 AM\nSource:[Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/01/the-u-s-should-not-bail-out-argentina/)\n\n**Milei\u2019s Dollar Crisis: A Fragile Economy on the Brink of Collapse**\nArgentina's economy under President Javier Milei is facing a severe dollar shortage, with nearly $18 billion in dollar purchases since mid-April 2024 following the relaxation of the 'cepo' (currency controls) for individuals. Despite a $14 billion disbursement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a $20 billion agreement\u2014only five months after the initial bailout\u2014reserves continue to decline. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, issued three supportive posts on X (formerly Twitter) to stabilize confidence, but these have not attracted sufficient foreign investment. The upcoming meeting between Milei and Donald Trump on October 14, 2025, just before U.S. midterm elections, is seen as a political gesture rather than a financial commitment. The Central Bank of Argentina, led by Santiago Bausili, has taken emergency measures, including banning banks from acting as intermediaries for dollar transactions via digital wallets (Ual\u00e1, Mercado Pago) and brokerage firms (Cocos), citing regulatory authority. These actions reflect desperation amid accelerating dollar demand and dwindling reserves. The government\u2019s economic strategy, led by Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank President Bausili, has failed to build a dollar buffer ahead of the October 26 election. Despite transferring $1.5 billion in agricultural export gains to agribusinesses, the Treasury only retained $2.5 billion of $7 billion in declared foreign sales, with the rest absorbed by speculative demand. As a result, bond yields have fallen and the risk premium rose to 1,230 points. The IMF is expected to demand structural reforms and devaluation post-election. The article argues that Milei\u2019s government lacks political anchoring, with its economic model relying on unsustainable financial speculation and external support. Without a credible political foundation, the government\u2019s stability\u2014and the viability of its economic program\u2014remains in question.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:45 AM\nSource:[El Destape](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/economia/donald-trump/milei-baila-en-la-cornisa-cambiaria-20251010552)\n\n**Latin America at the Crossroads: The Institutional Quality Index 2025 Reveals Fragile Foundations and a Path Forward**\nThe 2025 Institutional Quality Index (ICI), developed by economist Mart\u00edn Krause and published by the Latin American Liberal Network (Relial) with support from the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, reveals a persistent challenge across Latin America: strong democratic institutions correlate with national prosperity, while institutional erosion leads to uncertainty. Canada and the United States lead the regional ranking, followed by Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica\u2014three Latin American countries that combine political stability with economic openness, representing the exception that confirms the rule of fragile institutional quality in the region. At the bottom are Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti, trapped in authoritarianism and institutional collapse. The rest of Latin America shows uneven progress: Peru and Panama occupy mid-tier positions, while Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina\u2014despite their size and influence\u2014face persistent issues such as weak justice systems, unstable economic rules, and political power eroding checks and balances. Brazil is undergoing a significant institutional moment, with former President Jair Bolsonaro recently sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison for conspiracy against democratic order, making him the third former Brazilian president to be convicted by the judiciary\u2014a development highlighting the functioning of legal mechanisms in a democracy. Argentina is seen as a country in transition: under President Javier Milei, the economy has seen inflation drop from 200% to around 40%, fiscal balance restored, and growth near 5%. However, the ICI data still reflect conditions prior to Milei\u2019s reforms. The Buenos Aires provincial elections served as a political thermometer: La Libertad Avanza won 34% of the vote, compared to 47% for Peronism\u2014a surprising defeat that triggered a market reaction: a two-digit stock market drop, a surge in country risk, and the peso pushed to the edge of its exchange rate band. However, following Milei\u2019s U.S. visit and endorsements from the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Donald Trump, markets rebounded: bonds and stocks rose, country risk declined sharply, and the dollar fell further, aided by a $7 billion tax relief package implemented in three days. These market signals tempered the initial electoral shock and provided political breathing room ahead of October\u2019s crucial congressional elections. More than economic performance, the Buenos Aires vote appeared to penalize the government\u2019s credibility, particularly due to corruption allegations involving Milei\u2019s sister and chief advisor, Karina Milei, and a perceived tepid presidential response\u2014contrasting with Milei\u2019s promise to 'cleanse the elite.' October\u2019s elections, which will renew half the Congress, are decisive: Milei needs to expand his parliamentary base to advance deep reforms in fiscal, labor, and pension policy. The ICI\u2019s central lesson is clear: prosperity does not come by decree or rhetoric, but through rules that limit power, protect property, enforce contracts, and promote economic freedom\u2014exemplified by Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico now face the opportunity\u2014and test\u2014of following that path, while Nicaragua and Venezuela serve as warnings of what happens when institutions are abandoned. For liberalism, this is a moment of both opportunity and challenge: Argentina must transform its current economic momentum into real institutional strengthening capable of resisting the cycle of hope and disappointment that plagues much of Latin America.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/america-latina-frente-al-espejo-de-sus-instituciones-nid01102025/)\n\n**Milei Government Sells Dollars Amid Argentine Peso Decline After U.S. Financial Rescue Ambiguity**\nThe Argentine peso faced renewed pressure, falling over 6% intraday on September 30, 2025\u2014the largest single-day drop since September 8\u2014prompting the government of President Javier Milei to intervene by selling dollars in the spot market. By 13:50 Buenos Aires time, the peso had declined 1.3% for the day, though the exact volume sold was not disclosed, as the Central Bank declined to comment and the Ministry of Economy did not respond to inquiries. This marked a sharp reversal from a previous rally of over 10% following U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s announcement of a $20 billion financial rescue package. Despite earlier gains fueled by a temporary tax reduction on exports that generated $7 billion in revenue and the re-imposition of some capital controls, the peso\u2019s decline resumed due to uncertainty over Milei\u2019s political stability ahead of the October 26 midterm elections and ambiguity about the future of his exchange rate policy. The lack of clarity on the U.S. bailout\u2019s terms continued to weigh on assets. Argentine dollar-denominated bonds maturing in 2035 dropped more than 1.3 cents to 54 cents on the dollar, among the worst performances in emerging markets. BBVA strategist Alejandro Cuadrado noted that while the U.S. gesture calmed markets, it did not resolve underlying imbalances or reverse the peso\u2019s medium-term upward trend. Milei, in his first public appearance since Bessent\u2019s announcement, stated that Argentina would maintain its swap agreement with China while negotiating a financial rescue with Washington, confirmed that financing is secured through the end of next year, and announced planned cabinet changes after the October 26 elections.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 10:33 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/bloomberg/bc-gobierno-de-milei-sale-a-vender-dolares-tras-nueva-baja-en-peso-argentino.phtml)\n\n**Argentina's Milei Grapples with Turmoil Ahead of Crucial Parliamentary Elections**\nJavier Milei, the libertarian president of Argentina, is facing growing political turbulence ahead of the October 26, 2025 parliamentary elections.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Milei cut subsidies, regulations and public payrolls, producing a fiscal surplus (excluding interest) and stopping the Central Bank from financing deficits. The first results show monthly inflation fell from 12.8\u202f% in December, when Milei was elected, to 1.9\u202f% in August. However, Argentina remains tied to a rigid exchange regime that keeps the peso artificially stable at the cost of foreign reserves and competitiveness. The WSJ warned: 'No es gratis, no es un regalo. Es deuda y Argentina tendr\u00e1 que pagarla', highlighting that Mexico faced a similar crisis in 1994. Economists say the real problem is structural: inequality, poverty, lack of decent jobs, health and education crises, and dependence on primary sectors. The peso collapsed after the official party\u2019s electoral defeat, forcing the Central Bank to spend billions to maintain parity. Milei promised 'dolarizaci\u00f3n' but lacks the political and financial space to implement it. Former IMF chief Gita Gopinath recommends devaluation and a floating currency, but the president fears the political cost. Price controls have temporarily curbed inflation, but rising internal costs have hurt competitiveness and spiked imports. The WSJ argues a lasting solution requires a more flexible currency and a stronger export sector. Argentina still has high protectionism and heavy tax burdens that limit industry. Although Milei suspended some export taxes, the US is pressuring to reactivate them as part of the rescue conditions. The Trump administration could negotiate a trade deal with Argentina, opening new markets and reducing China\u2019s influence, but such support would depend on deep structural reforms and fiscal discipline.

Milei\u2019s shock\u2011therapy\u2014dropping the exchange\u2011rate peg, tightening fiscal policy, cutting state financing and launching a \"cultural war\" against the \"casta\"\u2014initially lowered inflation from 20\u202f% monthly in January 2024 to below 5\u202f% in June and pushed the risk\u2011country spread from 2,500 points in 2023 to about 500 points in January\u202f2025.  However, the over\u2011valued peso and the need for dollar inflows created a crisis when the government removed the currency controls in April\u202f2025.  The Central Bank raised bank reserve requirements to 53\u202f% and paid interest in pesos of almost 80\u202f% to curb the dollar, which led to a sharp contraction in economic activity.  The Centro de Econom\u00eda Pol\u00edtica Argentina (Cepa) reported a real current\u2011account surplus of 49.8\u202f% and an additional financing cost of roughly US\u202f100\u202fmillion for firms.  The Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos (Indec) showed that GDP grew 6\u202f% YoY in Q2\u202f2025 but fell 0.1\u202f% from Q1, while consumption dropped 1.1\u202f%.  The article cites Marina\u202fDal\u202fPoggetto, director of EcoGo, who notes that Milei secured US\u202f22\u202fbillion from a fiscal moratorium and another US\u202f20\u202fbillion from the IMF, yet never re\u2011accessed international credit.  It also quotes sociologist Ariel\u202fWilkis: 'El milagro de Milei fue hacer un ajuste con apoyo popular.'  The piece highlights the political fallout: Milei\u2019s approval slipped to just under 50\u202f% after raising utilities and cutting public pensions, and he lost the Buenos\u202fAires legislative race by about 14\u202fpercentage points.  Credit\u2011card delinquency rose from 1.9\u202f% in June to 4.4\u202f% in July, and personal\u2011loan delinquency climbed from 4.1\u202f% to 6.4\u202f%.

This was the first such intervention since the country adopted a floating exchange regime in April\u202f2024.  After the sale, the Central Bank\u2019s dollar reserves fell by US$\u202f98\u202fmillion, leaving a balance of US$\u202f3.977\u202fbillion.  The move followed a sharp rise in the wholesale dollar rate to 1.474\u202f50 pesos, the upper limit of the currency band, and a retail rate of 1.485\u202fpesos, with some private banks reporting 1.490\u202fpesos.  The intervention was authorised under the IMF\u2011approved rule that allows the Central Bank to sell reserves when the wholesale rate exceeds the band\u2019s ceiling, which was set at 1.474\u202f40 pesos the day before.  \n\nMilei\u2019s administration has struggled to build confidence and attract foreign investment despite cutting inflation from over 200\u202f% to a lower level.  The government\u2019s liberal policy of ending the \u201ccepo\u201d (a cap on dollar purchases) in April led to a freer but weaker peso, increasing demand for dollars and pressuring the currency.  According to Carlos\u202fHenrique, director of operations at Frente\u202fCorretora, the intervention is a \u201ccrisis containment\u201d and a \u201cdrastic change\u201d from Milei\u2019s previously liberal stance: \n\n'The government had been trying to reduce volatility with higher interest rates and banking restrictions, but the pressure on the peso made direct intervention inevitable, reflecting problems that had been building up since before the current political crisis and the inability to resolve the fiscal crisis,' he said.\n\nThe article also notes political turmoil, including a corruption scandal involving the president\u2019s sister Karina\u202fMilei and a poor showing for Milei\u2019s party in the September\u202f7 provincial elections, where the party received 33.7\u202f% of the vote compared with 47.3\u202f% for the Peronists.  These events are portrayed as contributing to the peso\u2019s weakness and the need for intervention.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 01:51 PM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2025/09/18/argentina-intervencao-cambio-53-milhoes-dolar.ghtml)\n\n**How Is Milei Performing in Argentina?**\nIn November\u202f2023, a group of more than 100 economists, including Thomas\u202fPiketty, sent an open letter warning that if Javier\u202fMilei implemented his radical proposals the Argentine economy would collapse.  The article argues that this \u2018devastation\u2019 did not occur because Milei never fully carried out the promised reforms.  Instead, he adopted more conventional policies, mainly deep austerity, which the piece describes as \u2018feroce e molto traumatiche\u2019 but not radically different from those proposed by centre\u2011right candidate Patricia\u202fBullrich or recommended by the IMF.\n\nMilei\u2019s administration has been criticised for weakening democracy, threatening press freedom and dismantling institutions that defend human rights and minorities.  Economically, the article highlights that inflation \u2013 which was about 140\u202f% annually when Milei took office, after hovering near 300\u202f% \u2013 fell to 36.6\u202f% in July\u202f2024.  This decline was achieved by turning a fiscal deficit into a surplus through a harsh austerity campaign that froze wages and pensions, laid off more than 30\u202f000 public employees, halted many infrastructure projects and cut subsidies for the poorest.\n\nThe article quotes Milei saying the peso was \u2018meno di un escremento\u2019 and explains that the government raised interest rates, required banks to hold more reserves and sold dollar reserves to support the peso\u2019s value.  It notes that the peso\u2019s appreciation has helped curb inflation but also made imports cheaper and exports more expensive, potentially harming domestic industry.\n\nSocial indicators are mixed: poverty fell from 41.7\u202f% in December\u202f2023 to 34.7\u202f% in May\u202f2025 after the inflationary shock, yet the austerity cuts have harmed the most vulnerable.  The article reports a 20\u202fbillion\u2011dollar IMF loan and a 6.1\u202f% GDP growth in Q1\u202f2025, but warns that inflation remains far above the 2\u202f% target and that the peso\u2011support strategy is increasingly problematic.\n\nThe piece concludes that Milei\u2019s reforms may be stalling and that his lack of parliamentary majority limits his ability to push further liberalisation.  It frames the situation as a potential experiment that could either recover or fail, drawing parallels with past Argentine presidents.\n\nKey metrics cited: inflation 140\u202f% \u2192 36.6\u202f%; poverty 41.7\u202f% \u2192 53\u202f% \u2192 34.7\u202f%; IMF loan ~20\u202fbillion\u202fUSD; GDP growth 6.1\u202f% Q1\u202f2025.\n\nQuotes used: 'meno di un escremento', 'dato eccellente', 'inflazione 140\u202f% circa', 'pesa ha un valore abbastanza alto', 'inflazione 36,6\u202f%'.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 08:14 AM\nSource:[Il Post](https://www.ilpost.it/2025/09/14/milei-argentina-economia/)\n\n**A Vote Sparks a Triple Blow for Argentina\u2019s Economy**\nArgentina\u2019s ruling coalition suffered a decisive defeat in the Buenos Aires provincial election, with the Peronist candidate winning 47.3% against Mil\u00e9\u2019s 33.7%, a margin of roughly 13 percentage points that exceeds market and poll expectations. This loss signals that Mil\u00e9\u2019s camp will face greater challenges in the October 26 national mid\u2011term elections, heightening concerns about the government\u2019s ability to continue its economic reform agenda.\n\nThe market reacted sharply: the peso fell 5.6% intraday, closed 3.1% lower at 1,407 per dollar, setting a new historical low. The benchmark stock index (.MERV) dropped 13%, while the U.S.\u2011listed Argentine index (.BKAR) plunged 18%. The 2030 government bond fell 5.875 cents, the largest single\u2011day decline since the 2020 restructuring. Morgan Stanley had warned that a Mil\u00e9 defeat could trigger a 10\u2011point drop in international bonds and, on Monday, withdrew a recent \u2018buy\u2019 rating.\n\nAnalysts point to the political fallout: Mil\u00e9\u2019s sister, Karina Mil\u00e9, is embroiled in a corruption scandal, and the market has already lost about 20% in the past month. The peso\u2019s de\u2011peg has pressured the government to intervene in foreign\u2011exchange markets. UBS cautions that any instability in the currency market could trigger a chain reaction across Argentine assets; JPMorgan stresses that the government\u2019s policy choices in the coming weeks will determine inflation expectations and the success of its stabilization plan; Barclays warns that continued dollar sales by the finance ministry could erode confidence in the peso before the mid\u2011term elections.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has approved a $20\u202fbillion loan plan, with $15\u202fbillion already disbursed, but has not yet clarified whether election results will affect the cooperation. Analysts now see political risk as the biggest uncertainty ahead of the mid\u2011term elections, and the Mil\u00e9 administration\u2019s ability to balance currency stability, inflation control, and political pressure will directly influence the prospects of its reform agenda.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 01:35 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8mVADZQvJMT)\n\n**Problems of President Milei**\nPresident Javier\u202fMilei entered office promising a fresh political approach, but the realities of governance forced him to break many promises and shift his rhetoric. Early in his term he froze discretionary provincial transfers, cut superfluous spending, simplified administrative procedures, and halted 100\u202f% of public\u2011works projects\u2014moves that shocked the economic history of Argentina. In monetary policy he abandoned his liberal stance and adopted the interventionist ideas of Economy Minister Luis\u202fCaputo, committing to a crawling\u2011peg devaluation despite an initial 50\u202f% devaluation. Analysts were surprised, noting that the program resembled the failed devaluation strategy of Fern\u00e1ndez\u202fde\u202fHoz (1978\u20111981). The 2024 economy remained relatively stable, but by 2025 the crawling\u2011peg made Argentina \u201cextremely expensive\u201d; consumer goods were pricier than in Canada or Spain, imports surged, and many industries closed. Foreign investment fell to a negative 1.700\u202fmillion\u202fUSD, and 2\u202f200 military and security personnel requested resignations due to loss of purchasing power. In April\u202f2025 the government suspended the crawling\u2011peg, allowing a partial float; the dollar appreciated 20\u202f% and approached the band\u2019s ceiling, erasing the first 15\u202fmonths of devaluation policy in 30\u202fdays. To stave off inflation before the October\u202f2025 midterm elections, the government intervened in the futures market, buying dollars at 1\u202f200\u202fpesos, a move that caused losses of more than 500\u202fmillion\u202fUSD by April\u202f2026. Interest rates were raised to 40\u201150\u202f% nominal (64.82\u202f% effective in May\u202f2025), and the Central Bank increased reserve requirements from 45\u202f% to 53.5\u202f% to curb liquidity. Credit renewal became painful, leading to rising defaults. The author labels this \u201cthe Churchill effect,\u201d where political and financial interests override industrial and social ones. Milei\u2019s popularity fell in 2025 amid scandals such as the \u201cLibra\u2011Gate\u201d and unverified corruption allegations. The Mises Institute reconsidered awarding him for his supposed knowledge of the Austrian School, citing that his understanding is \u201csuperficial and deficient.\u201d The article concludes that Milei\u2019s government is playing a double\u2011or\u2011nothing game, and that after the elections he will have to change monetary policy again. Quotes: \u2018el Banco Central no va a intervenir hasta que el d\u00f3lar toque el piso de la banda\u2019 (April\u202f2025) and \u2018el conocimiento de Javier\u202fMilei sobre la Escuela Austr\u00edaca es superficial y deficiente\u2019 (Mises Institute).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 03:48 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/participacion/lectores-corresponsales/20250905/11027139/problemas-presidente-milei.html)\n\n**Peronism and Javier Milei president of Argentina**\nThe article explains that when Javier Milei was elected president in 2023, Argentina was in a severe economic crisis: annual inflation had exceeded 200\u202fpercent, more than 40\u202fpercent of the population lived in poverty, and public trust in the political class was near zero. It traces the historical dominance of Peronism, noting its roots in Juan\u202fDomingo\u202fPer\u00f3n\u2019s 1946 election, its evolution through left\u2011 and right\u2011leaning phases, and its control of unions, subsidies, and state power, which has led to inflation, fiscal deficits, and structural inefficiency. The piece highlights the fragmentation of Peronism in the 21st\u202fcentury, the brief non\u2011Peronist presidency of Mauricio\u202fMacri, and the return of Peronism under Alberto\u202fFern\u00e1ndez and Cristina\u202fKirchner, during which inflation surged and the peso collapsed. Milei\u2019s rise is portrayed as a reaction to this long\u2011standing crisis; his platform calls for abolishing the central bank, exploring dollarization, cutting ministries from 18 to 9, deregulating markets, and ending subsidies, framing the campaign as a war against \u201cparasites feeding on the public.\u201d The article quotes the author\u2019s own phrasing: 'Milei's program was radical: abolish the central bank, explore dollarization, slash ministries from 18 to 9, deregulate markets, and end subsidies.' It also notes the immediate backlash\u2014higher food, fuel, and transport prices, union strikes, and legal challenges\u2014while emphasizing Milei\u2019s shift away from China and Brazil toward the United States and free\u2011market allies, describing this as an ideological stance of liberty versus authoritarianism. The author concludes that Milei\u2019s presidency is a gamble: if his policies succeed, inflation could fall, the peso could stabilize, and growth could return; if they fail, the country risks deeper poverty and inequality. The piece is framed as an analytical commentary on Argentina\u2019s political history and Milei\u2019s potential to break its cycle of crisis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 02, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@meatballmicah/peronism-and-javier-milei-president-of-argentina-9e2a9208e9fb)\n\n**Argentina's Economic Challenges: A Stabilization Policy with Uncertain Outcomes**\nArgentina's President Javier Milei has implemented a policy to stabilize the exchange rate and reduce inflation. The policy involves limiting the devaluation of the peso to 2% per month until February 2025, and then to 1% per month until April 2025. This policy, known as the 'crawling-peg', aims to reduce inflation by limiting the devaluation of the peso. The government has also reduced public spending by 27% in 2024, which has led to a primary surplus and a reduction in the budget deficit. However, this policy has also led to a recession, with the GDP declining by 1.7% in 2024. The government has also implemented a law to encourage foreign investment, known as the 'Rigi' regime, which offers tax incentives to foreign investors. Despite these efforts, the Argentine economy is still facing challenges, including a high inflation rate, a large budget deficit, and a decline in foreign reserves. The government's ability to maintain a stable exchange rate and reduce inflation is uncertain, and some experts predict that a currency crisis is likely to occur in the near future.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 11, 2025 02:20 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/argentine-le-risque-dune-nouvelle-crise-monetaire-261412)\n\n**Milei's Economic Impact: A Painful Success or the Dawn of a New Argentina?**\nSince taking office on December 10, 2023, President Javier Milei's economic management has had a significant impact on Argentina's economy, with results that some have described as a 'economic miracle' in a context of prolonged crisis and historically high inflation. Before Milei's arrival, Argentina faced an annual inflation rate of nearly 211%, with over 50% of the population in a state of poverty. The economy was in recession due to years of exchange controls, high state intervention, and erratic economic policies. Milei managed to improve the economic environment and achieved a significant reduction in inflation. Despite not having a majority in Congress, he demonstrated political skill in negotiating with moderate sectors and passing key laws that promoted his economic agenda in a fragmented political scenario. Milei's government implemented a fiscal adjustment without precedent, significantly reducing public spending. This included the elimination or reduction of energy and transportation subsidies, the suspension of public works, and a significant reduction in public salaries and pensions. As a result of these policies, Argentina's monthly inflation rate decreased significantly, from 25.5% in December 2023 to 1.5% in May 2025, the lowest rate in five years. Although the accumulated inflation remains high, the deceleration of the monthly rate is a key indicator of a downward trend. The agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the acquisition of external financing were crucial for strengthening international reserves and sustaining economic policy without resorting to uncontrolled monetary emission. In summary, Milei's government has achieved a deep and, so far, successful economic adjustment in a country with a history of recurrent crises. His combination of fiscal discipline, structural reforms, political management, and economic opening has laid the foundations for Argentina to reduce inflation to historic lows and resume growth. However, social costs and political challenges persist. It is still too early to celebrate victory, but the economic results achieved to date have been very positive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[ruizhealytimes.com](https://ruizhealytimes.com/economia-y-negocios/el-impacto-economico-de-milei-un-exito-doloroso-o-el-amanecer-de-una-nueva-argentina/)\n\n**Milei's Economic Reforms: A Double-Edged Sword for Argentina**\nJavier Milei, the President of Argentina since 2023, has been criticized both positively and negatively since taking office. In this article, we will discuss whether he has saved or ruined the Argentine economy. Before we begin, we need to understand a few terms: liberalism, dollarization, hyperinflation, and shock therapy. Milei's core philosophy is libertarianism, which prioritizes individual freedoms and limited government intervention. His economic vision includes abandoning the Argentine peso and adopting the US dollar as the official currency, a process known as dollarization. This solution aims to combat hyperinflation, but it also carries risks, such as loss of control over monetary policy. Milei's policies are shaped by Argentina's extremely high inflation rates, which are a result of excessive money printing and fiscal indiscipline. Hyperinflation is a term used to describe economic instability caused by excessive money printing and lack of fiscal discipline. Milei's reforms are part of this context. Shock therapy, on the other hand, refers to radical and swift economic reforms to address economic problems. This approach is often used in countries transitioning from planned to market economies, as seen in Argentina today. Milei's shock therapy has achieved some positive results, including a budget surplus for the first time in 12 years and improvements in some key economic indicators. However, the radical nature of his approach has also led to significant social and economic costs, including job losses, reduced social benefits, and increased vulnerability of the middle class. The benefits of his policies, such as lower inflation and increased foreign investment, may not be felt by the general public, who are struggling to access basic necessities. If his current policies continue, Argentina's economy may experience a lasting recovery in areas such as low inflation, increased foreign investment, and budget discipline. However, there are also political risks involved, including potential social unrest, protests, and a decline in public support for Milei's government. If the public perception of poverty deepens, the gains made by his policies may become unsustainable.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 15, 2025 01:34 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@mehmetbayhan/liberalizmin-yeni-y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z%C4%B1-milei-arjantini-kurtarabilecek-mi-3a6a5dea0020)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters assessed whether the United States will bail out Argentina before 2026, focusing on the possibility of a dollar transfer, swap line (drawn upon), or US purchase of Argentine sovereign bonds. All experts agreed the question is highly contingent on Argentina\u2019s acute macroeconomic crisis, the close ideological alignment between Milei and Trump, recent high-level US announcements (specifically a proposed $20B swap line), and strong domestic opposition within the US (especially from Congress and agricultural lobbies). Nearly all highlighted the historical US preference to intervene via the IMF rather than bilaterally, emphasizing that direct US action is rare. Arguments in favor of a bailout being likely include the urgency of Argentina\u2019s situation, US signaling, strategic interests in countering Chinese influence, and both Milei\u2019s and Trump\u2019s need for political wins ahead of respective elections. Factors decreasing likelihood were robust domestic US resistance, the low base rate for such bailouts, institutional and legal hurdles, and ambiguity in US announcements (Trump and his Treasury downplaying a direct 'bailout'). Final probabilities ranged widely: those emphasizing historical/structural dependency, strategic alignment, and crisis urgency gave higher odds (65-73%), while others focused on institutional and political constraints, as well as IMF preference, gave lower or moderate probabilities (30-38%). One liberal institutionalist view expressed significant skepticism. Scenarios where the US acts (resolves Yes) involved a deepening Argentine financial crisis triggering an urgent US response (swap line drawn, loan, or bond purchase); No scenarios involved continued US signaling without concrete action, stalled by political and operational headwinds, and IMF or other lenders providing stopgap support. Overall, the group was split between moderately high and moderate-to-low probabilities, citing an unusually high but not overwhelming likelihood of a US bailout by year-end due to unique political incentives and acute crisis, counterbalanced by strong procedural and political obstacles.",
