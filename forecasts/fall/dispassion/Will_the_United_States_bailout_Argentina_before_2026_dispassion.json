The US may wait until after the October 26 midterms, both to see if Milei\u2019s reforms survive and to avoid looking like it is intervening in Argentina\u2019s domestic politics. The operational step required for resolution\u2014a drawdown on the swap line or outright transfer\u2014has not yet occurred, and the momentum appears to have stalled amid ongoing controversy. The base rate for direct US government bailouts outside the IMF is very low; the most analogous cases (Mexico 1995 and 2008-09 emerging market crises) involved clear contagion risks and Congressional buy-in. Here, the ideological motivation is strong but the risk of inaction is mostly reputational and limited to US-Argentina relations, not global financial stability. Markets have rebounded somewhat on the mere announcement, suggesting the US can achieve some stabilization without actually disbursing funds unless there is a new crisis. Barring a sudden meltdown or a strong post-election mandate for Milei, the most likely outcome is continued signaling without operationalization. Given the explicit swap line negotiation and the nonzero chance of a new crisis before year-end, I assign a probability well above the base rate, but less than even odds.",

From a bilateral negotiation perspective, the US has already invested significant diplomatic capital in public signaling and has operational tools (e.g., the Exchange Stabilization Fund) that can be used rapidly and with limited Congressional input. Moreover, your reasoning may overweight the 'wait-and-see' approach post-midterms without fully accounting for the acute pressure on both Milei and Trump to show results before the end of the year, especially as further deterioration could force a fast, politically motivated draw on the swap line.

While you correctly highlight the unprecedented level of US signaling and the acute financial pressure on Argentina, your reasoning underestimates several frictions that remain decisive from a sovereign debt advisory perspective. First, the operationalization of a swap line or direct Treasury transfer is non-trivial, particularly given the strong bipartisan opposition in Congress and the absence of a clear systemic risk to the US or global financial system. The ESF and Fed swap lines, while technically available, are subject to legal and political checks that have slowed or blocked similar interventions in the past. Second, the base rate for direct US bilateral bailouts\u2014as opposed to multilateral IMF-led rescues\u2014remains extremely low, and your forecast seems to treat this case as a fait accompli on the basis of political alignment and crisis severity alone. Finally, the evidence as of now is that US intervention, while prepared as a contingency, is being used primarily as a signaling device to stabilize markets without an actual transfer of funds\u2014a pattern consistent with recent market reactions. Therefore, while a Yes outcome is plausible and the odds are elevated, an 83% probability seems to overstate the likelihood given the procedural, political, and historical constraints still in play."

While it is correct that the US has sometimes acted to prevent contagion or to counter rival influence, these interventions have typically occurred only when clear, imminent threats to US national interests were present (e.g., Mexico 1995), and usually with more robust Congressional or market consensus. Current evidence shows strong domestic resistance, especially from key constituencies like US farmers, and no compelling systemic risk to the US. Moreover, the ambiguity and hesitancy in official US statements suggest a reluctance to cross the threshold into actual disbursement absent a true crisis. The US has a long track record of using rhetorical and symbolic support to stabilize markets without operationalizing a bailout, especially when IMF involvement is ongoing. Thus, while the probability is above historical base rates, the odds of direct action before 2026 are likely closer to the 35-45% range suggested by other forecasters, unless a sharper crisis emerges."

However, from a realist perspective, your probability appears too high given the present-day context. The global system has shifted since earlier eras of more automatic core intervention: the US is now more constrained by domestic political resistance, especially with bipartisan opposition and strong agricultural interests affected by Argentine policy. Additionally, you underweight the US preference for acting through the IMF as a shield against direct political costs, and the use of rhetorical signaling as a substitute for material support. While structural pressures and the acute crisis make a bailout plausible, the base rate for direct bilateral US bailouts remains low, and the current ambiguity in US policy signals a reluctance to act unless Argentina's collapse threatens core US security interests or triggers regional contagion. Thus, while your reasoning is logically consistent within your framework, your probability overstates the likelihood of operationalizing an actual US bailout before 2026."

From a Liberal Institutionalism perspective, I find your probability (45%) well justified: you correctly identify the critical tension between the US's role as a guarantor of international economic order and the strong domestic and political constraints that make a direct bailout contentious. Your emphasis on the significance of the announced swap line (without evidence yet of a draw) and the preference for multilateral over bilateral responses matches both the international norms and actual US behavior in crisis management. By placing the probability materially above the historical baseline but still below even odds, you avoid both unwarranted pessimism and excessive boldness. This aligns with the slow-moving nature of institutional change and the inertia of established crisis response mechanisms, capturing the nuanced reality that while intervention is plausible and more likely than in past cycles, a direct US bailout is still not the default outcome absent a further sharp deterioration."

While you are right that the technical bar for a Yes is low and that the executive has significant discretionary power (especially via the ESF), your forecast seems to treat political alignment and crisis urgency as near-determinative. In reality, the backlash from key domestic groups (notably US farmers), bipartisan Congressional skepticism, and the historical reluctance to bypass the IMF create serious obstacles to operationalizing a direct bilateral rescue\u2014especially as no funds have moved and ambiguity has proven stabilizing thus far. Markets have partially stabilized on signaling alone, suggesting the US may achieve its objectives without triggering the resolution criteria. Your forecast also appears to underplay the risk that post-election political shifts in either country could further complicate or delay action. The base rate for direct US bailouts in comparable cases remains very low, and while the probability is higher than usual, it is not near-certain. I would argue for a much more tempered estimate."

You are correct to emphasize that political and market pressures can override historical inertia, especially when both US and Argentine executives have strong incentives to produce a result before the resolution window closes. Your critique of lower estimates is compelling: historical base rates, while informative, may be too conservative for an environment where diplomatic and financial tools are being pre-positioned for rapid deployment.

My critique of the SovereignDebtAdvisory position highlighted the risk of underweighting the diplomatic and negotiation dynamics driving the US toward action in the current cycle. However, I note that several well-argued forecasts\u2014especially from IMF/sovereign debt and liberal institutionalist perspectives\u2014anchor lower, reflecting real procedural and political obstacles. The range of group probabilities clusters around 35-45% (cautious), 68% (myself/realism), and 80%+ (bold, structural/critical theories).

(2) On the other hand, my critique of the very high probabilities offered by debt crisis theorists (80%+) remains valid: operational hurdles, bipartisan US opposition, and the lack of a clear systemic contagion risk still create substantial barriers to execution, even with the swap line in place. Additionally, market stabilization from mere signaling reduces the pressure for actual disbursement. On balance, while I recognize the possibility for a fast, politically motivated symbolic draw if another acute crisis unfolds, I do not see enough new information to warrant a large upward revision, but I acknowledge the case for a modest increase.

Others (Sovereign Debt Advisory, International Political Economy, Liberal Institutionalism, and myself) point to consistent historical reluctance for direct US bailouts outside the IMF, current bipartisan domestic opposition, and the likelihood that the US is using signaling as a stabilizing tool rather than preparing for imminent disbursement. The Realism forecaster's 68% probability seems, in my view, to overweight the risk of contagion and the US tendency to act preemptively, given the absence of a clear systemic threat. My critique stands: the technical and political bar for an actual (not just signaled) swap line draw or direct transfer remains high, and ambiguity in public US statements underscores the executive's hesitancy. However, the group consensus is moderately higher than my baseline. The possibility of a rapid drawdown for symbolic or last-resort stabilization, even for a small amount, cannot be ignored given the acute volatility and the short window remaining. Therefore, I will modestly raise my probability to reflect the slight but real risk of a post-midterm crisis triggering a qualifying US action, but I remain below 50%.",

Several experts\u2014especially those from US foreign policy, sovereign debt, and institutionalist perspectives\u2014highlight the procedural and political friction points that would need to be overcome for the US to actually operationalize the swap line or provide a direct loan. The acute crisis in Argentina and the explicit signaling by the US make a bailout plausible, but the lack of an immediate systemic risk to US interests, the ambiguity of US official statements, and the fact that market stabilization has been partly achieved through rhetoric suggest a lower chance than my original forecast.

No new evidence from the group decisively alters my view, but in light of the consistent slight upward tilt from several peers and the ongoing acute risks in Argentina, I will nudge my probability up to 40, to reflect the slightly increased plausibility of a symbolic or last-minute draw on the swap line as a crisis measure.",

Most assign probabilities in the 35-45% range, with only Realism and Dependency Theory going much higher (and their reasoning was critiqued for underweighting domestic and procedural friction). The critique of the extremely high (83%) probability underscores the need to discount technical capability by the very real possibility of last-minute non-execution or further stabilization through signaling alone. There is also consensus that a swap line draw or direct Treasury action is not yet a fait accompli, and the US may well rely on ambiguity and the IMF unless a dramatic new crisis forces action.

Following the crisis, Argentina underwent [debt restructuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring) and economic reforms, however economic problems persisted and by 2023 inflation had once again [surpassed 100%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-64960385).\n\nIn the [2023 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Argentine_general_election), [Javier Milei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei) was elected President of Argentina. Milei campaign on a platform of [radical economic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei_2023_presidential_campaign) and free market policies, including dollarizing the economy, abolishing the Central Bank, and privatizing state-owned enterprises. Following the election, Milei faced political pressure and challenges and moderated his proposals, however significant economic reforms were still implemented.\n\nDuring Milei's tenure, Argentina's economy has continued to face significant challenges. Although poverty has dropped from its peak, many have lost access to basic needs programs, and although inflation declined following an initial spike, it remains far above normal levels.&#x20;\n\nPrior to Milei's presidency, Argentina had implemented significant currency controls, resulting in a split between the formal and informal rate of the Argentine Peso. Milei initially attempted to unify the exchange rate with a \u201ccrawling peg\u201d system before eventually allowing the peso to [float freely](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/04/12/argentina-to-lift-strict-currency-controls-on-monday_6740130_4.html).

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Can Trump save Argentina's crisis-stricken economy as he hopes?**\nFollowing a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 24, 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed Argentine President Javier Milei as a 'truly fantastic and powerful leader,' marking a rare public endorsement. The next day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced close coordination with Milei and pledged a 'large' financial intervention to stabilize Argentina\u2019s economy, including a potential $20 billion credit line, bond purchases, and central bank currency swaps. This support came amid a severe economic crisis: Argentina\u2019s peso fell 6% in a single day on October 1, 2025, its largest drop since September 8, forcing the government to sell $1 billion in foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. The central bank had already spent $1 billion by September 19 to keep the peso within its exchange-rate band, which limits daily fluctuations against the dollar. Milei, a far-right libertarian elected in November 2023, had implemented austerity measures\u2014cutting subsidies, slashing public payrolls, and reducing ministries\u2014leading inflation to drop from 211% to 37% in a year. However, economic activity stalled, unemployment rose, and public approval fell from 48% in July to 41% in mid-September. Political setbacks included a provincial election loss, a corruption scandal involving his sister, and Congress overturning his vetoes on health and education funding. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) launched its 23rd program in April 2024, underpinning the peso\u2019s floating exchange rate. Despite Bessent\u2019s announcement, the peso dropped again by 6% on October 1, closing at 1,380 per dollar. Analysts, including Andres Abadia of Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that U.S. support has strengthened Argentina\u2019s international reserves and eased default risk, but described the aid as a 'bridge to the election' rather than a long-term solution. The intervention is expected to delay a peso devaluation until after the October 26 mid-term elections, when Milei seeks to strengthen his Libertad Levanza Party\u2019s position in Congress.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the Trump administration was prepared to 'do what is needed' to support Argentina ahead of its October 2024 legislative elections, sparking bipartisan backlash. The move is controversial because U.S. soybean farmers face their worst financial outlook in decades after China shifted soybean purchases from the U.S. to Argentina, especially following a tax holiday in Argentina that boosted imports. Milei\u2019s radical austerity measures\u2014symbolized by a chainsaw gift to Elon Musk\u2014failed to resolve Argentina\u2019s deep economic issues, including a 33% poverty rate and a projected recession. His overvalued peso benefits the wealthy but harms exports, while Chinese imports surged 80% in the first half of 2024. Despite his ideological alignment with Trump, Milei\u2019s popularity is declining, with his party facing low poll numbers. A U.S. bailout via the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) would be unprecedented and unjustified, as Argentina\u2019s financial problems do not threaten U.S. dollar stability. Such a bailout would primarily benefit hedge funds and speculators who bet on Milei\u2019s failed reforms, inflating asset values without fostering long-term growth. The Treasury\u2019s use of the ESF for political or ideological reasons would bypass congressional oversight and risk public trust, especially after past overreach during the 2008 crisis. U.S. farmers, already suffering from inflation, worker shortages, and retaliatory tariffs, are protesting the bailout, with small-farm bankruptcies at a five-year high. Even some Republicans, like Senator Chuck Grassley, oppose the move. While Argentina produces critical minerals like lithium, the Treasury is not justifying intervention on that basis. The article argues the U.S. should reject the bailout, instead focusing on aiding struggling American farmers and consumers, reforming the misuse of the ESF, and pursuing strategic economic partnerships in Latin America through trade, development finance, and supply chain investments\u2014not bailouts for politically connected leaders. The IMF is also criticized for promoting austerity that benefits global investors over local populations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:51 AM\nSource:[Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/01/the-u-s-should-not-bail-out-argentina/)\n\n**Milei\u2019s Dollar Crisis: A Fragile Economy on the Brink of Collapse**\nArgentina's economy under President Javier Milei is facing a severe dollar shortage, with nearly $18 billion in dollar purchases since mid-April 2024 following the relaxation of the 'cepo' (currency controls) for individuals.

Milei\u2019s party, La Libertad Avanza, suffered a major setback in the Buenos Aires provincial elections, losing by 14 points to the Peronist opposition, a strategic blow just one month before the national vote. His economic reforms, which include slashing public spending, eliminating export taxes on agricultural products, and securing a potential $20 billion swap agreement with the U.S. Treasury, are under strain due to a 17% depreciation of the peso over three months and a $1 billion loss in central bank reserves. The government has also faced a credibility crisis after audio recordings revealed a suspected bribery scheme involving Karina Milei, the president\u2019s sister and secretary general of the presidency, at the National Disability Agency. Milei has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated. Despite these challenges, Milei continues to promote his vision of economic freedom, declaring on X: 'Vive la libert\u00e9, bordel!' and asserting that 'the worst is behind us.' However, analysts like Ignacio Labaqui warn that if the campaign is led by the same figures responsible for the provincial defeat, the government could face serious legislative obstacles. With $28 billion in debt due by mid-2026 and foreign direct investment down 90% in Q1 2025 to just over \u20ac500 million, the sustainability of Milei\u2019s 'liberal revolution' remains uncertain.

The next day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced close coordination with Milei and pledged a 'large' financial intervention to stabilize Argentina\u2019s economy, including a potential $20 billion credit line, bond purchases, and central bank currency swaps. This support came amid a severe economic crisis: Argentina\u2019s peso fell 6% in a single day on October 1, 2025, its largest drop since September 8, forcing the government to sell $1 billion in foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. The central bank had already spent $1 billion by September 19 to keep the peso within its exchange-rate band, which limits daily fluctuations against the dollar. Milei, a far-right libertarian elected in November 2023, had implemented austerity measures\u2014cutting subsidies, slashing public payrolls, and reducing ministries\u2014leading inflation to drop from 211% to 37% in a year. However, economic activity stalled, unemployment rose, and public approval fell from 48% in July to 41% in mid-September. Political setbacks included a provincial election loss, a corruption scandal involving his sister, and Congress overturning his vetoes on health and education funding. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) launched its 23rd program in April 2024, underpinning the peso\u2019s floating exchange rate. Despite Bessent\u2019s announcement, the peso dropped again by 6% on October 1, closing at 1,380 per dollar. Analysts, including Andres Abadia of Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that U.S. support has strengthened Argentina\u2019s international reserves and eased default risk, but described the aid as a 'bridge to the election' rather than a long-term solution. The intervention is expected to delay a peso devaluation until after the October 26 mid-term elections, when Milei seeks to strengthen his Libertad Levanza Party\u2019s position in Congress. Experts warn that if Milei performs poorly, inflation risks will rise and financial instability could return. Bessent\u2019s pledge marks the second major U.S.-backed bailout for Argentina under Trump, following a $50 billion IMF deal for Mauricio Macri in 2018.

Canada and the United States lead the regional ranking, followed by Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica\u2014three Latin American countries that combine political stability with economic openness, representing the exception that confirms the rule of fragile institutional quality in the region. At the bottom are Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti, trapped in authoritarianism and institutional collapse. The rest of Latin America shows uneven progress: Peru and Panama occupy mid-tier positions, while Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina\u2014despite their size and influence\u2014face persistent issues such as weak justice systems, unstable economic rules, and political power eroding checks and balances. Brazil is undergoing a significant institutional moment, with former President Jair Bolsonaro recently sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison for conspiracy against democratic order, making him the third former Brazilian president to be convicted by the judiciary\u2014a development highlighting the functioning of legal mechanisms in a democracy. Argentina is seen as a country in transition: under President Javier Milei, the economy has seen inflation drop from 200% to around 40%, fiscal balance restored, and growth near 5%. However, the ICI data still reflect conditions prior to Milei\u2019s reforms. The Buenos Aires provincial elections served as a political thermometer: La Libertad Avanza won 34% of the vote, compared to 47% for Peronism\u2014a surprising defeat that triggered a market reaction: a two-digit stock market drop, a surge in country risk, and the peso pushed to the edge of its exchange rate band. However, following Milei\u2019s U.S. visit and endorsements from the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Donald Trump, markets rebounded: bonds and stocks rose, country risk declined sharply, and the dollar fell further, aided by a $7 billion tax relief package implemented in three days. These market signals tempered the initial electoral shock and provided political breathing room ahead of October\u2019s crucial congressional elections. More than economic performance, the Buenos Aires vote appeared to penalize the government\u2019s credibility, particularly due to corruption allegations involving Milei\u2019s sister and chief advisor, Karina Milei, and a perceived tepid presidential response\u2014contrasting with Milei\u2019s promise to 'cleanse the elite.' October\u2019s elections, which will renew half the Congress, are decisive: Milei needs to expand his parliamentary base to advance deep reforms in fiscal, labor, and pension policy. The ICI\u2019s central lesson is clear: prosperity does not come by decree or rhetoric, but through rules that limit power, protect property, enforce contracts, and promote economic freedom\u2014exemplified by Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico now face the opportunity\u2014and test\u2014of following that path, while Nicaragua and Venezuela serve as warnings of what happens when institutions are abandoned. For liberalism, this is a moment of both opportunity and challenge: Argentina must transform its current economic momentum into real institutional strengthening capable of resisting the cycle of hope and disappointment that plagues much of Latin America.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/america-latina-frente-al-espejo-de-sus-instituciones-nid01102025/)\n\n**Milei Government Sells Dollars Amid Argentine Peso Decline After U.S. Financial Rescue Ambiguity**\nThe Argentine peso faced renewed pressure, falling over 6% intraday on September 30, 2025\u2014the largest single-day drop since September 8\u2014prompting the government of President Javier Milei to intervene by selling dollars in the spot market. By 13:50 Buenos Aires time, the peso had declined 1.3% for the day, though the exact volume sold was not disclosed, as the Central Bank declined to comment and the Ministry of Economy did not respond to inquiries. This marked a sharp reversal from a previous rally of over 10% following U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s announcement of a $20 billion financial rescue package. Despite earlier gains fueled by a temporary tax reduction on exports that generated $7 billion in revenue and the re-imposition of some capital controls, the peso\u2019s decline resumed due to uncertainty over Milei\u2019s political stability ahead of the October 26 midterm elections and ambiguity about the future of his exchange rate policy. The lack of clarity on the U.S. bailout\u2019s terms continued to weigh on assets. Argentine dollar-denominated bonds maturing in 2035 dropped more than 1.3 cents to 54 cents on the dollar, among the worst performances in emerging markets. BBVA strategist Alejandro Cuadrado noted that while the U.S. gesture calmed markets, it did not resolve underlying imbalances or reverse the peso\u2019s medium-term upward trend. Milei, in his first public appearance since Bessent\u2019s announcement, stated that Argentina would maintain its swap agreement with China while negotiating a financial rescue with Washington, confirmed that financing is secured through the end of next year, and announced planned cabinet changes after the October 26 elections.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 10:33 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/bloomberg/bc-gobierno-de-milei-sale-a-vender-dolares-tras-nueva-baja-en-peso-argentino.phtml)\n\n**Argentina's Milei Grapples with Turmoil Ahead of Crucial Parliamentary Elections**\nJavier Milei, the libertarian president of Argentina, is facing growing political turbulence ahead of the October 26, 2025 parliamentary elections.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Milei cut subsidies, regulations and public payrolls, producing a fiscal surplus (excluding interest) and stopping the Central Bank from financing deficits. The first results show monthly inflation fell from 12.8\u202f% in December, when Milei was elected, to 1.9\u202f% in August. However, Argentina remains tied to a rigid exchange regime that keeps the peso artificially stable at the cost of foreign reserves and competitiveness. The WSJ warned: 'No es gratis, no es un regalo. Es deuda y Argentina tendr\u00e1 que pagarla', highlighting that Mexico faced a similar crisis in 1994. Economists say the real problem is structural: inequality, poverty, lack of decent jobs, health and education crises, and dependence on primary sectors. The peso collapsed after the official party\u2019s electoral defeat, forcing the Central Bank to spend billions to maintain parity. Milei promised 'dolarizaci\u00f3n' but lacks the political and financial space to implement it. Former IMF chief Gita Gopinath recommends devaluation and a floating currency, but the president fears the political cost. Price controls have temporarily curbed inflation, but rising internal costs have hurt competitiveness and spiked imports. The WSJ argues a lasting solution requires a more flexible currency and a stronger export sector. Argentina still has high protectionism and heavy tax burdens that limit industry. Although Milei suspended some export taxes, the US is pressuring to reactivate them as part of the rescue conditions.

Milei\u2019s shock\u2011therapy\u2014dropping the exchange\u2011rate peg, tightening fiscal policy, cutting state financing and launching a \"cultural war\" against the \"casta\"\u2014initially lowered inflation from 20\u202f% monthly in January 2024 to below 5\u202f% in June and pushed the risk\u2011country spread from 2,500 points in 2023 to about 500 points in January\u202f2025.  However, the over\u2011valued peso and the need for dollar inflows created a crisis when the government removed the currency controls in April\u202f2025.  The Central Bank raised bank reserve requirements to 53\u202f% and paid interest in pesos of almost 80\u202f% to curb the dollar, which led to a sharp contraction in economic activity.  The Centro de Econom\u00eda Pol\u00edtica Argentina (Cepa) reported a real current\u2011account surplus of 49.8\u202f% and an additional financing cost of roughly US\u202f100\u202fmillion for firms.  The Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos (Indec) showed that GDP grew 6\u202f% YoY in Q2\u202f2025 but fell 0.1\u202f% from Q1, while consumption dropped 1.1\u202f%.  The article cites Marina\u202fDal\u202fPoggetto, director of EcoGo, who notes that Milei secured US\u202f22\u202fbillion from a fiscal moratorium and another US\u202f20\u202fbillion from the IMF, yet never re\u2011accessed international credit.  It also quotes sociologist Ariel\u202fWilkis: 'El milagro de Milei fue hacer un ajuste con apoyo popular.'  The piece highlights the political fallout: Milei\u2019s approval slipped to just under 50\u202f% after raising utilities and cutting public pensions, and he lost the Buenos\u202fAires legislative race by about 14\u202fpercentage points.  Credit\u2011card delinquency rose from 1.9\u202f% in June to 4.4\u202f% in July, and personal\u2011loan delinquency climbed from 4.1\u202f% to 6.4\u202f%.  The article concludes that the economic slowdown, high inflation, and political defeats threaten Milei\u2019s agenda, while foreign investors remain wary, citing the need for a stable macro\u2011environment and reforms that cannot be enacted by decree.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/negocios/2025-09-20/la-motosierra-de-milei-se-cala-el-milagro-economico-de-argentina-amenaza-con-acabar-en-pesadilla.html)\n\n**Argentina\u2019s Milei Government Intervenes in Currency Market, Selling $53\u202fMillion to Stabilize Peso**\nThe Argentine government, under President Javier\u202fMilei, intervened in the foreign\u2011exchange market on 17\u202fApril\u202f2025, selling US$\u202f53\u202fmillion (\u2248R$\u202f280\u202fmillion) from the Central Bank\u2019s reserves to curb the peso\u2019s rapid depreciation.  This was the first such intervention since the country adopted a floating exchange regime in April\u202f2024.  After the sale, the Central Bank\u2019s dollar reserves fell by US$\u202f98\u202fmillion, leaving a balance of US$\u202f3.977\u202fbillion.  The move followed a sharp rise in the wholesale dollar rate to 1.474\u202f50 pesos, the upper limit of the currency band, and a retail rate of 1.485\u202fpesos, with some private banks reporting 1.490\u202fpesos.  The intervention was authorised under the IMF\u2011approved rule that allows the Central Bank to sell reserves when the wholesale rate exceeds the band\u2019s ceiling, which was set at 1.474\u202f40 pesos the day before.  \n\nMilei\u2019s administration has struggled to build confidence and attract foreign investment despite cutting inflation from over 200\u202f% to a lower level.  The government\u2019s liberal policy of ending the \u201ccepo\u201d (a cap on dollar purchases) in April led to a freer but weaker peso, increasing demand for dollars and pressuring the currency.  According to Carlos\u202fHenrique, director of operations at Frente\u202fCorretora, the intervention is a \u201ccrisis containment\u201d and a \u201cdrastic change\u201d from Milei\u2019s previously liberal stance: \n\n'The government had been trying to reduce volatility with higher interest rates and banking restrictions, but the pressure on the peso made direct intervention inevitable, reflecting problems that had been building up since before the current political crisis and the inability to resolve the fiscal crisis,' he said.\n\nThe article also notes political turmoil, including a corruption scandal involving the president\u2019s sister Karina\u202fMilei and a poor showing for Milei\u2019s party in the September\u202f7 provincial elections, where the party received 33.7\u202f% of the vote compared with 47.3\u202f% for the Peronists.  These events are portrayed as contributing to the peso\u2019s weakness and the need for intervention.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 01:51 PM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2025/09/18/argentina-intervencao-cambio-53-milhoes-dolar.ghtml)\n\n**How Is Milei Performing in Argentina?**\nIn November\u202f2023, a group of more than 100 economists, including Thomas\u202fPiketty, sent an open letter warning that if Javier\u202fMilei implemented his radical proposals the Argentine economy would collapse.  The article argues that this \u2018devastation\u2019 did not occur because Milei never fully carried out the promised reforms.  Instead, he adopted more conventional policies, mainly deep austerity, which the piece describes as \u2018feroce e molto traumatiche\u2019 but not radically different from those proposed by centre\u2011right candidate Patricia\u202fBullrich or recommended by the IMF.\n\nMilei\u2019s administration has been criticised for weakening democracy, threatening press freedom and dismantling institutions that defend human rights and minorities.  Economically, the article highlights that inflation \u2013 which was about 140\u202f% annually when Milei took office, after hovering near 300\u202f% \u2013 fell to 36.6\u202f% in July\u202f2024.  This decline was achieved by turning a fiscal deficit into a surplus through a harsh austerity campaign that froze wages and pensions, laid off more than 30\u202f000 public employees, halted many infrastructure projects and cut subsidies for the poorest.\n\nThe article quotes Milei saying the peso was \u2018meno di un escremento\u2019 and explains that the government raised interest rates, required banks to hold more reserves and sold dollar reserves to support the peso\u2019s value.  It notes that the peso\u2019s appreciation has helped curb inflation but also made imports cheaper and exports more expensive, potentially harming domestic industry.\n\nSocial indicators are mixed: poverty fell from 41.7\u202f% in December\u202f2023 to 34.7\u202f% in May\u202f2025 after the inflationary shock, yet the austerity cuts have harmed the most vulnerable.  The article reports a 20\u202fbillion\u2011dollar IMF loan and a 6.1\u202f% GDP growth in Q1\u202f2025, but warns that inflation remains far above the 2\u202f% target and that the peso\u2011support strategy is increasingly problematic.\n\nThe piece concludes that Milei\u2019s reforms may be stalling and that his lack of parliamentary majority limits his ability to push further liberalisation.  It frames the situation as a potential experiment that could either recover or fail, drawing parallels with past Argentine presidents.\n\nKey metrics cited: inflation 140\u202f% \u2192 36.6\u202f%; poverty 41.7\u202f% \u2192 53\u202f% \u2192 34.7\u202f%; IMF loan ~20\u202fbillion\u202fUSD; GDP growth 6.1\u202f% Q1\u202f2025.\n\nQuotes used: 'meno di un escremento', 'dato eccellente', 'inflazione 140\u202f% circa', 'pesa ha un valore abbastanza alto', 'inflazione 36,6\u202f%'.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 08:14 AM\nSource:[Il Post](https://www.ilpost.it/2025/09/14/milei-argentina-economia/)\n\n**A Vote Sparks a Triple Blow for Argentina\u2019s Economy**\nArgentina\u2019s ruling coalition suffered a decisive defeat in the Buenos Aires provincial election, with the Peronist candidate winning 47.3% against Mil\u00e9\u2019s 33.7%, a margin of roughly 13 percentage points that exceeds market and poll expectations. This loss signals that Mil\u00e9\u2019s camp will face greater challenges in the October 26 national mid\u2011term elections, heightening concerns about the government\u2019s ability to continue its economic reform agenda.\n\nThe market reacted sharply: the peso fell 5.6% intraday, closed 3.1% lower at 1,407 per dollar, setting a new historical low. The benchmark stock index (.MERV) dropped 13%, while the U.S.\u2011listed Argentine index (.BKAR) plunged 18%. The 2030 government bond fell 5.875 cents, the largest single\u2011day decline since the 2020 restructuring. Morgan Stanley had warned that a Mil\u00e9 defeat could trigger a 10\u2011point drop in international bonds and, on Monday, withdrew a recent \u2018buy\u2019 rating.\n\nAnalysts point to the political fallout: Mil\u00e9\u2019s sister, Karina Mil\u00e9, is embroiled in a corruption scandal, and the market has already lost about 20% in the past month. The peso\u2019s de\u2011peg has pressured the government to intervene in foreign\u2011exchange markets. UBS cautions that any instability in the currency market could trigger a chain reaction across Argentine assets; JPMorgan stresses that the government\u2019s policy choices in the coming weeks will determine inflation expectations and the success of its stabilization plan; Barclays warns that continued dollar sales by the finance ministry could erode confidence in the peso before the mid\u2011term elections.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has approved a $20\u202fbillion loan plan, with $15\u202fbillion already disbursed, but has not yet clarified whether election results will affect the cooperation. Analysts now see political risk as the biggest uncertainty ahead of the mid\u2011term elections, and the Mil\u00e9 administration\u2019s ability to balance currency stability, inflation control, and political pressure will directly influence the prospects of its reform agenda.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 01:35 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8mVADZQvJMT)\n\n**Problems of President Milei**\nPresident Javier\u202fMilei entered office promising a fresh political approach, but the realities of governance forced him to break many promises and shift his rhetoric. Early in his term he froze discretionary provincial transfers, cut superfluous spending, simplified administrative procedures, and halted 100\u202f% of public\u2011works projects\u2014moves that shocked the economic history of Argentina. In monetary policy he abandoned his liberal stance and adopted the interventionist ideas of Economy Minister Luis\u202fCaputo, committing to a crawling\u2011peg devaluation despite an initial 50\u202f% devaluation. Analysts were surprised, noting that the program resembled the failed devaluation strategy of Fern\u00e1ndez\u202fde\u202fHoz (1978\u20111981). The 2024 economy remained relatively stable, but by 2025 the crawling\u2011peg made Argentina \u201cextremely expensive\u201d; consumer goods were pricier than in Canada or Spain, imports surged, and many industries closed. Foreign investment fell to a negative 1.700\u202fmillion\u202fUSD, and 2\u202f200 military and security personnel requested resignations due to loss of purchasing power. In April\u202f2025 the government suspended the crawling\u2011peg, allowing a partial float; the dollar appreciated 20\u202f% and approached the band\u2019s ceiling, erasing the first 15\u202fmonths of devaluation policy in 30\u202fdays. To stave off inflation before the October\u202f2025 midterm elections, the government intervened in the futures market, buying dollars at 1\u202f200\u202fpesos, a move that caused losses of more than 500\u202fmillion\u202fUSD by April\u202f2026. Interest rates were raised to 40\u201150\u202f% nominal (64.82\u202f% effective in May\u202f2025), and the Central Bank increased reserve requirements from 45\u202f% to 53.5\u202f% to curb liquidity. Credit renewal became painful, leading to rising defaults. The author labels this \u201cthe Churchill effect,\u201d where political and financial interests override industrial and social ones. Milei\u2019s popularity fell in 2025 amid scandals such as the \u201cLibra\u2011Gate\u201d and unverified corruption allegations. The Mises Institute reconsidered awarding him for his supposed knowledge of the Austrian School, citing that his understanding is \u201csuperficial and deficient.\u201d The article concludes that Milei\u2019s government is playing a double\u2011or\u2011nothing game, and that after the elections he will have to change monetary policy again.

It traces the historical dominance of Peronism, noting its roots in Juan\u202fDomingo\u202fPer\u00f3n\u2019s 1946 election, its evolution through left\u2011 and right\u2011leaning phases, and its control of unions, subsidies, and state power, which has led to inflation, fiscal deficits, and structural inefficiency. The piece highlights the fragmentation of Peronism in the 21st\u202fcentury, the brief non\u2011Peronist presidency of Mauricio\u202fMacri, and the return of Peronism under Alberto\u202fFern\u00e1ndez and Cristina\u202fKirchner, during which inflation surged and the peso collapsed. Milei\u2019s rise is portrayed as a reaction to this long\u2011standing crisis; his platform calls for abolishing the central bank, exploring dollarization, cutting ministries from 18 to 9, deregulating markets, and ending subsidies, framing the campaign as a war against \u201cparasites feeding on the public.\u201d The article quotes the author\u2019s own phrasing: 'Milei's program was radical: abolish the central bank, explore dollarization, slash ministries from 18 to 9, deregulate markets, and end subsidies.' It also notes the immediate backlash\u2014higher food, fuel, and transport prices, union strikes, and legal challenges\u2014while emphasizing Milei\u2019s shift away from China and Brazil toward the United States and free\u2011market allies, describing this as an ideological stance of liberty versus authoritarianism. The author concludes that Milei\u2019s presidency is a gamble: if his policies succeed, inflation could fall, the peso could stabilize, and growth could return; if they fail, the country risks deeper poverty and inequality. The piece is framed as an analytical commentary on Argentina\u2019s political history and Milei\u2019s potential to break its cycle of crisis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 02, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@meatballmicah/peronism-and-javier-milei-president-of-argentina-9e2a9208e9fb)\n\n**Argentina's Economic Challenges: A Stabilization Policy with Uncertain Outcomes**\nArgentina's President Javier Milei has implemented a policy to stabilize the exchange rate and reduce inflation. The policy involves limiting the devaluation of the peso to 2% per month until February 2025, and then to 1% per month until April 2025. This policy, known as the 'crawling-peg', aims to reduce inflation by limiting the devaluation of the peso. The government has also reduced public spending by 27% in 2024, which has led to a primary surplus and a reduction in the budget deficit. However, this policy has also led to a recession, with the GDP declining by 1.7% in 2024. The government has also implemented a law to encourage foreign investment, known as the 'Rigi' regime, which offers tax incentives to foreign investors. Despite these efforts, the Argentine economy is still facing challenges, including a high inflation rate, a large budget deficit, and a decline in foreign reserves. The government's ability to maintain a stable exchange rate and reduce inflation is uncertain, and some experts predict that a currency crisis is likely to occur in the near future.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 11, 2025 02:20 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/argentine-le-risque-dune-nouvelle-crise-monetaire-261412)\n\n**Milei's Economic Impact: A Painful Success or the Dawn of a New Argentina?**\nSince taking office on December 10, 2023, President Javier Milei's economic management has had a significant impact on Argentina's economy, with results that some have described as a 'economic miracle' in a context of prolonged crisis and historically high inflation. Before Milei's arrival, Argentina faced an annual inflation rate of nearly 211%, with over 50% of the population in a state of poverty. The economy was in recession due to years of exchange controls, high state intervention, and erratic economic policies. Milei managed to improve the economic environment and achieved a significant reduction in inflation. Despite not having a majority in Congress, he demonstrated political skill in negotiating with moderate sectors and passing key laws that promoted his economic agenda in a fragmented political scenario. Milei's government implemented a fiscal adjustment without precedent, significantly reducing public spending. This included the elimination or reduction of energy and transportation subsidies, the suspension of public works, and a significant reduction in public salaries and pensions. As a result of these policies, Argentina's monthly inflation rate decreased significantly, from 25.5% in December 2023 to 1.5% in May 2025, the lowest rate in five years. Although the accumulated inflation remains high, the deceleration of the monthly rate is a key indicator of a downward trend. The agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the acquisition of external financing were crucial for strengthening international reserves and sustaining economic policy without resorting to uncontrolled monetary emission. In summary, Milei's government has achieved a deep and, so far, successful economic adjustment in a country with a history of recurrent crises. His combination of fiscal discipline, structural reforms, political management, and economic opening has laid the foundations for Argentina to reduce inflation to historic lows and resume growth. However, social costs and political challenges persist. It is still too early to celebrate victory, but the economic results achieved to date have been very positive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[ruizhealytimes.com](https://ruizhealytimes.com/economia-y-negocios/el-impacto-economico-de-milei-un-exito-doloroso-o-el-amanecer-de-una-nueva-argentina/)\n\n**Milei's Economic Reforms: A Double-Edged Sword for Argentina**\nJavier Milei, the President of Argentina since 2023, has been criticized both positively and negatively since taking office. In this article, we will discuss whether he has saved or ruined the Argentine economy. Before we begin, we need to understand a few terms: liberalism, dollarization, hyperinflation, and shock therapy. Milei's core philosophy is libertarianism, which prioritizes individual freedoms and limited government intervention. His economic vision includes abandoning the Argentine peso and adopting the US dollar as the official currency, a process known as dollarization. This solution aims to combat hyperinflation, but it also carries risks, such as loss of control over monetary policy. Milei's policies are shaped by Argentina's extremely high inflation rates, which are a result of excessive money printing and fiscal indiscipline. Hyperinflation is a term used to describe economic instability caused by excessive money printing and lack of fiscal discipline. Milei's reforms are part of this context. Shock therapy, on the other hand, refers to radical and swift economic reforms to address economic problems. This approach is often used in countries transitioning from planned to market economies, as seen in Argentina today. Milei's shock therapy has achieved some positive results, including a budget surplus for the first time in 12 years and improvements in some key economic indicators. However, the radical nature of his approach has also led to significant social and economic costs, including job losses, reduced social benefits, and increased vulnerability of the middle class. The benefits of his policies, such as lower inflation and increased foreign investment, may not be felt by the general public, who are struggling to access basic necessities. If his current policies continue, Argentina's economy may experience a lasting recovery in areas such as low inflation, increased foreign investment, and budget discipline. However, there are also political risks involved, including potential social unrest, protests, and a decline in public support for Milei's government. If the public perception of poverty deepens, the gains made by his policies may become unsustainable.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 15, 2025 01:34 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@mehmetbayhan/liberalizmin-yeni-y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z%C4%B1-milei-arjantini-kurtarabilecek-mi-3a6a5dea0020)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasting experts are divided on whether the United States will bail out Argentina before 2026, with final probabilities ranging from 35% to 83%. The main drivers increasing the likelihood include the acute and worsening financial crisis in Argentina (dwindling reserves, sharp peso depreciation), explicit political and ideological alignment between President Milei and the Trump administration, public signaling and the announcement of a $20 billion swap line, and heightened US geostrategic interests in Latin America\u2014specifically countering Chinese influence and maintaining regional stability. Experts note that the mechanism for a bailout exists and the bar for resolution (any transfer, swap line draw, or sovereign bond purchase) is relatively low. Arguments reducing the probability cite significant domestic US political resistance (bipartisan opposition, farmer backlash), the historical rarity of direct US rather than IMF bailouts for Argentina, and the Trump administration's public ambiguity about whether an actual bailout will be operationalized as opposed to mere support or signaling. Many experts highlight the US preference for working through the IMF and suggest that action may only occur if there is a severe post-election crisis or if IMF support is exhausted or proves insufficient. The strongest Yes cases emphasize the unusual level of US commitment and the acute crisis potentially forcing last-minute intervention, while the No cases focus on continued ambiguity, operational or legal delays, and political calculation outweighing the need to act. Overall, the consensus is that the likelihood of a US bailout is substantially higher than historical base rates, especially with the infrastructure prepared and public commitments made, but still subject to material uncertainty given political and operational headwinds.",
