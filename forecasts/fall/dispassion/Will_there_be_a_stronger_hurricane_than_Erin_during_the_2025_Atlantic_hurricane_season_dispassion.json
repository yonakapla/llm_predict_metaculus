Sea surface temperatures are exceptionally high, and recent seasons (2023, 2024, 2025) have shown an uptick in multiple Category 5 hurricanes, likely linked to anthropogenic warming. However, the base rate for any given storm exceeding an existing Cat 5 threshold is still sub-50%, especially as seasons with multiple Cat 5s remain the exception, not the rule. Given expected favorable conditions for at least the next 7\u201310 days, the imminent threat from Humberto, and the climate context, the probability of a stronger hurricane than Erin this season is meaningfully elevated but not yet a majority likelihood. The most likely path to a 'Yes' outcome is Humberto intensifying further within the next week, possibly aided by Fujiwhara effects, or another late-season storm taking advantage of record-warm SSTs. Nonetheless, the status quo and base rates exert downward pressure. I estimate the probability at 35%.",

The article states that the storm is located roughly 690\u202fkm northeast of the North Windward Islands and poses a threat mainly to shipping and coastal areas. Over the weekend it is expected to strengthen further, and waves generated by the storm will reach the North Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto\u202fRico and Bermuda, creating dangerous conditions. 'Umberto' is the third Atlantic hurricane of the season; experts note the possible formation of another storm, 'Imelda', and the season is projected to continue until 30\u202fNovember. Hurricanes are among the most destructive natural phenomena in the Caribbean, with peak activity in August and September when warm Atlantic waters fuel the most powerful cyclones.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 06:23 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/society/27/09/2025/68d780f79a79470a2108855b)\n\n**Forecasters Keep Watch on Two Atlantic Storms Close Enough to Join into a Super Hurricane**\nOn September 26\u202f2025, meteorologists warned that the Atlantic storm Humberto, which became a Category\u202f1 on Friday and is projected to reach Category\u202f3 with sustained winds exceeding 110\u202fmph by Saturday, could merge with the nearby tropical storm 94L, expected to be named 'Imelda', as they approach the southeastern U.S. coast. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Humberto will maintain Category\u202f3 strength until at least Tuesday but is not expected to make landfall. AccuWeather forecaster Alex DaSilva noted that the two systems could alter each other's tracks or combine via the 'Fujiwhara Effect', a rare interaction that has occurred only four times near the East Coast since 1995. Models predict Imelda, once a tropical storm, could strike Florida, Georgia, or the Carolinas, posing a risk of severe flooding. The storms were 600\u202fmiles apart on Thursday. The most powerful hurricane of the 2025 season so far was Erin, a Category\u202f5 that struck in August but stayed 200\u202fmiles offshore.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 05:03 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/weather/2025/09/26/forecasters-two-atlantic-storms-close-enough-to-join-into-a-super-hurricane/)\n\n**Tropical Cyclones and Their Intensification in a Changing Climate**\nThe article explains how tropical cyclones\u2014called \"\u0625\u0639\u0635\u0627\u0631\" in Arabic\u2014form over warm ocean waters and how their intensity is measured.  It states that a storm becomes a tropical storm when wind speeds exceed 63\u202fkm/h and a hurricane when they exceed 118\u202fkm/h.  The Saffir\u2011Simpson scale, developed in 1971 by engineers Herbert\u202fSaffir and Robert\u202fSimpson, classifies hurricanes into five categories based on sustained wind speed; Category\u202f5 requires winds of at least 252\u202fkm/h.  The article notes that the scale also estimates potential damage, with categories\u202f3\u20115 considered \"major hurricanes\" that can cause \"devastating\" to \"catastrophic\" losses.\n\nIt highlights the recent hurricane Ragasa, described as the strongest storm of the year, which struck the Philippines, southern China, Hong\u202fKong, and Taiwan, causing severe damage.  Experts quoted in the piece say that hurricanes have become more destructive and harder to predict because of climate change.\n\nThe article cites a July 2025 sea\u2011surface\u2011temperature average of 20.88\u202f\u00b0C, the second\u2011highest recorded, only 0.01\u202f\u00b0C below the July 2023 record, indicating a long\u2011term warming trend.  It also reports that the 2020 North Atlantic hurricane season saw a 10\u202f% increase in heavy rainfall every three hours and a 5\u202f% increase in cumulative heavy rainfall every three days due to anthropogenic climate change.\n\nBen\u202fClark, a researcher at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, is quoted: '\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u062c\u0645 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0641\u0648\u0631\u064a \u064a\u064f\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0628\u0639\u0635\u0631 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u062f \u0641\u062a\u0643\u064b\u0627'.

The overall diameter of a hurricane can range from 200 to 500\u202fkm, occasionally reaching 1,000\u202fkm.\n\nOverall, the article presents scientific facts and expert opinions to argue that climate change is intensifying tropical cyclones, making them more destructive and harder to forecast.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 05:51 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/climate/2025/9/26/%d9%85%d8%a7-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%b5%d9%8a%d8%b1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%af%d8%a7%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%b5%d9%81)\n\n**As tropics kick up, NHC says tropical depression could develop soon over Bahamas**\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports that the Atlantic has entered a slow but active season, with two hurricanes in the last week and a third system\u2014Invest\u202f94L\u2014likely to develop into Tropical Storm Imelda and potentially impact the U.S. East Coast.  The NHC says there is a 90\u202f% chance the system will become a tropical depression within the next two to seven days, and that tropical\u2011storm watches or warnings could be issued for parts of the Bahamas as early as later Friday.  Forecasters note that the new system is producing a large area of disorganized showers, gusty winds, and that it will likely become a tropical depression while moving northwestward or northward across the central and northwestern Bahamas.  Hurricane Humberto, the season\u2019s third hurricane, is currently a Category\u202f1 storm with 90\u202fmph sustained winds, located about 450\u202fmiles northeast of the Caribbean\u2019s northern Leeward Islands, moving northwest at 5\u202fmph; it is forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane later today or on Saturday.  The NHC also highlights the Fujiwhara effect\u2014where two nearby cyclones can rotate around each other\u2014which could complicate track predictions.  Other recent activity includes post\u2011tropical Cyclone Gabrielle and the earlier Category\u202f5 Hurricane Erin, which remained out at sea.  NOAA\u2019s early\u2011August forecast calls for 13\u201118 named storms this season, with 5\u20119 becoming hurricanes and 2\u20115 reaching major hurricane status.

This is the third hurricane of the season, following Erin and Gabrielle, and if it reaches Category\u202f3 or stronger it would mark the first time in 90\u202fyears that a season\u2019s first three hurricanes have all intensified to that level, according to hurricane expert Philip\u202fKlotzbach.  The storm is not expected to make landfall in the next five days, though Bermuda should monitor it early next week; a moderate to high risk of rip currents will affect the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada for at least the next couple of days.  The NHC also highlighted a separate tropical disturbance over the Greater Antilles that has a 90\u202f% chance of becoming a tropical depression by the weekend as it moves through the Bahamas.  The NHC warned that, despite uncertainty in the long\u2011range track, there is a significant risk of wind, rainfall, and storm surge impacts for parts of the southeastern U.S. coast early next week.  This is especially concerning as western North Carolina is still recovering from Hurricane Helene\u2019s flooding last September; by September\u202f25, 95\u202f% of public roads damaged by Helene had been repaired, 57\u202f% of damaged bridges had been repaired or replaced, and crews had removed more than 6.1\u202fmillion cubic metres of debris from waterways as of September\u202f16.

The NHC forecast that Humberto will become a major hurricane by the weekend, potentially reaching wind speeds of 145 mph by September 28, roughly 1,100 miles east\u2011southeast of Miami. However, the NHC said Humberto is not the greatest threat to the United States; the system that Americans should watch most closely is an unnamed storm expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda. Humberto may influence Imelda\u2019s path through the Fujiwhara effect. NHC director Michael Brennan explained that 'How the storms interact with one another and with other weather systems in the region will determine the extent of impacts the storms could have on the US East Coast, the Bahamas and potentially Bermuda over the next few days,' and added that 'But the risks are growing for impacts along the coast between Florida and North Carolina.' In Charleston, South Carolina, National Weather Service meteorologist Blair Holloway said 'has not increased or changed much from yesterday (Sept. 25)' and that 'Considerable uncertainty remains including its development, track, intensity, timing, and potential impacts.' Houston\u2011based meteorologist Matt Lanza noted that 'However a non\u2011trivial number of models peel the system back to the east, into the open Atlantic, due in part to some complex interactions with Hurricane Humberto.' He added that 'There is real potential here for a rainmaker in the Carolinas, and particularly North Carolina,' and that 'Readers there will certainly and understandably be concerned that this could become another Hurricane Helene\u2011like event. For now, we think that is unlikely, as the strongest rains appear to be east of areas most impacted by Helene, and the overall signal for prolonged, heavy rainfall is lower this time.' NOAA predicts 6 to 10 inches of rainfall for the hardest\u2011hit areas. Humberto is expected to follow a pattern similar to Hurricane Erin, moving between the US and Bermuda, and its strengthening increases the risk of long\u2011period swells, creating hazardous seas and surf along the US coast. Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, said the Atlantic would then be '3 for 3' in hurricanes reaching major status this year, following Erin and Gabrielle.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 06:19 PM\nSource:[The Express Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2569134/tropical-storm-humberto-becomes-a-hurricane-nhc-says)\n\n**Forecasters Keep Watch on Two Atlantic Storms Close Enough to Join into a Super Hurricane**\nOn September 26\u202f2025, meteorologists warned that the Atlantic storm Humberto, which became a Category\u202f1 on Friday and is projected to reach Category\u202f3 with sustained winds exceeding 110\u202fmph by Saturday, could merge with the nearby tropical storm 94L, expected to be named 'Imelda', as they approach the southeastern U.S. coast. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Humberto will maintain Category\u202f3 strength until at least Tuesday but is not expected to make landfall. AccuWeather forecaster Alex DaSilva noted that the two systems could alter each other's tracks or combine via the 'Fujiwhara Effect', a rare interaction that has occurred only four times near the East Coast since 1995. Models predict Imelda, once a tropical storm, could strike Florida, Georgia, or the Carolinas, posing a risk of severe flooding. The storms were 600\u202fmiles apart on Thursday.

The Saffir\u2011Simpson scale, developed in 1971 by engineers Herbert\u202fSaffir and Robert\u202fSimpson, classifies hurricanes into five categories based on sustained wind speed; Category\u202f5 requires winds of at least 252\u202fkm/h.  The article notes that the scale also estimates potential damage, with categories\u202f3\u20115 considered \"major hurricanes\" that can cause \"devastating\" to \"catastrophic\" losses.\n\nIt highlights the recent hurricane Ragasa, described as the strongest storm of the year, which struck the Philippines, southern China, Hong\u202fKong, and Taiwan, causing severe damage.

The NHC says there is a 90\u202f% chance the system will become a tropical depression within the next two to seven days, and that tropical\u2011storm watches or warnings could be issued for parts of the Bahamas as early as later Friday.  Forecasters note that the new system is producing a large area of disorganized showers, gusty winds, and that it will likely become a tropical depression while moving northwestward or northward across the central and northwestern Bahamas.  Hurricane Humberto, the season\u2019s third hurricane, is currently a Category\u202f1 storm with 90\u202fmph sustained winds, located about 450\u202fmiles northeast of the Caribbean\u2019s northern Leeward Islands, moving northwest at 5\u202fmph; it is forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane later today or on Saturday.

Humberto was last reported 750\u202fkm (465\u202fmi) east of the Northern Windward Islands in the Caribbean, with sustained winds of 85\u202fkm/h (50\u202fmph) and a northwest motion of 13\u202fkm/h (8\u202fmph). The NHC said Humberto \"is gaining strength\" and \"expects it to become a hurricane in a day or more over the central Atlantic.\" No land threat was identified at the time, but the forecast track is becoming more complex due to a nearby system that could become a cyclone west of Humberto. Gabrielle has dropped to Category\u202f1 after reaching Category\u202f4 on Monday; the Azores authorities activated an emergency plan. The NHC predicts Gabrielle will reach the Azores later today as a hurricane with sustained winds of 120\u202fkm/h (75\u202fmph). Early September, meteorologists noted that 60\u202f% of the Atlantic season\u2019s cyclonic activity remained, with the season running from June\u202f1 to November\u202f30 and peaking on September\u202f10. So far this year the Atlantic has seen eight cyclones\u2014Hurricanes Erin and Gabrielle, and storms Andrea, Barry, Chantal, Dexter, Fernand, and Humberto. Chantal was the only storm to make landfall in the U.S. this year, killing two people in North Carolina in July.

Forecast models project it could strengthen to a Category\u202f2 or\u202f3 hurricane by the weekend before curving back out to sea, though impacts on Bermuda or elsewhere remain uncertain. A second potential system, Invest\u202f94L, is a disorganized area of thunderstorms over the northeastern Caribbean that may develop into a tropical depression or storm by the weekend as it approaches the Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center says 94L has a high chance of becoming a tropical depression or storm, and the next name on the 2025 Atlantic list would be Imelda. The forecast notes that Humberto could interact with 94L, possibly altering 94L\u2019s track or even absorbing it, leading to a range of outcomes for the U.S., including the possibility of 94L making landfall as Imelda. 94L could bring up to 6\u202finches of rain to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands by Thursday, raising flash\u2011flood and landslide risks in steep terrain. The article explains that as October approaches, the typical late\u2011season formation zones shift westward, and the 2025 season has already seen only seven named storms through September\u202f22, below the 1991\u20112020 average of 10. Two of those storms, Erin and Gabrielle, became hurricanes, with Erin reaching Category\u202f5 and Gabrielle Category\u202f4.

In the morning of Friday, the storm was only a category 1 hurricane, with winds of 120 km/h. Less than 24 hours later, it had reached category 5, the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with winds of nearly 260 km/h, according to CNN Brasil. This rapid increase puts Erin among the fastest-intensifying cyclones ever recorded in the Atlantic. Currently classified as category 3, with winds of around 200 km/h, Erin may intensify again in the coming days, returning to category 4 or 5. According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the wind field is increasing in size, with tropical storm-force gusts extending over 330 km from the center. Despite recent weakening, the NHC warns that the storm's effects continue to be significant. Sudden flooding and landslides are expected in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, while intense rainfall is expected to hit the Turks and Caicos Islands. Tropical storm warnings are in effect in the region, and the US Coast Guard has imposed navigation restrictions in ports of the US Virgin Islands and six municipalities in Puerto Rico, including San Juan. NHC Director Mike Brennan emphasized that Erin 'deepened and intensified explosively' since Friday, in an evolution described as rare and perilous. The current trajectory indicates that the cyclone will not directly hit the continental US, but will move north and then northeast, gradually moving away from the American coast. However, waves and marine currents 'with a risk of death' will hit almost the entire eastern coast, including Florida, Mid-Atlantic states, Bermuda, Bahamas, and even Canada. Meteorologists note that rapid intensification - when a hurricane's winds increase by at least 56 km/h in a 24-hour period - usually occurs mainly in September and October. However, Erin has anticipated the usual calendar, recording this phenomenon in mid-August. Not only is it rare, but it is also concerning: it is the 11th hurricane to reach category 5 in the Atlantic since 2016, a number considered exceptionally high. In total, only 43 cyclones have reached that intensity since records began. This is already the fourth consecutive season with a record of category 5 hurricanes. In 2024, two systems - Beryl and Milton - reached that intensity. Experts attribute the trend to the warming of oceans and the atmosphere, driven by fossil fuel pollution and global warming. Warmer waters provide additional fuel for the storms, increasing not only the likelihood of hurricane formation but also their ability to grow explosively. On Saturday night, Erin was located about 240 km from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and 250 km from Anguilla, with winds of 200 km/h. The NHC reiterates that, even without direct impact on land, Erin will continue to represent a threat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had already predicted a 'above-average' Atlantic season in 2025. Erin, the first major hurricane of the season, confirms these concerns. Before him, four other storms - Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and Dexter - crossed the Atlantic basin, but none exceeded the tropical storm category. With the growing intensity of extreme meteorological phenomena, Erin becomes a case emblematic of how changing climate is altering the behavior of hurricanes, making them stronger, faster, and more dangerous.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 17, 2025 04:48 PM\nSource:[Jornal Expresso](https://expresso.pt/sociedade/meteorologia/2025-08-17-de-categoria-1-a-5-em-apenas-24-horas-furacao-erin-bate-recordes-no-atlantico-1b9f7d5c)\n\n**Hurricane Erin Reaches Category 5, Threatens Caribbean**\nHurricane Erin, the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic cyclone season, has reached category 5, the highest level on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of 257 km/h.

According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm's wind speed reached 257 km/h in its epicenter. The storm intensified rapidly, from a tropical storm with a wind speed of 112 km/h on Friday morning to a Category 5 storm with a wind speed of 235 km/h on Saturday. Meteorologists note that this rapid intensification may be unexpected for coastal regions, where residents and emergency services have less time to prepare. The storm is expected to pass north of the eastern coast of the US, moving westward across the Atlantic. The areas between the Outer Banks of North Carolina and the Bermuda Islands are at the greatest risk, with forecasts predicting dangerous storm surges, beach erosion, and strong winds. However, the region is expected to avoid a direct hit from the storm. The Caribbean islands, including the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, have already felt the effects of the hurricane, with heavy rainfall and flash flooding possible until Sunday. Experts attribute the storm's rapid intensification to warm Atlantic waters, a lack of significant wind shear, and the storm's exit from a dry air zone. These same factors contributed to the rapid intensification of Hurricane 'Milton', which struck Florida in October. Specialists continue to monitor the storm's trajectory to refine its future path and threat level for coastal regions in the US and the Atlantic.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: August 17, 2025 02:45 AM\nSource:[Mignews](https://mignews.com/news/lifestyle/uragan-erin-stal-samym-moshnym-v-etom-sezone-v-atlantike.html)\n\n**Hurricane Erin Reaches Category 5, Expected to Pass West of US**\nThe hurricane Erin intensified on Saturday (16) and reached category 5, the maximum level on the Saffir-Simpson scale, north of the Caribbean islands. According to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), sustained winds reached 257 km/h (160 mph) as the system moved about 170 km north of Anguilla, in the Leeward Islands. Projections indicate that the storm will continue to move west across the Atlantic without directly hitting the eastern coast of the United States. The NHC predicts that Erin will pass between the Bahamas and the Outer Banks in North Carolina on Wednesday (20), causing rough seas, coastal erosion, and gusty winds, but sparing the region of more severe impacts. 'The best scenario is that it passes exactly in the middle of the path between the Bahamas and the Outer Banks,' said meteorologist Dan Pydynowski, of AccuWeather. The rapid intensification of the phenomenon was favored by warm ocean waters, low wind shear, and the absence of dry air. In just 24 hours, Erin went from a tropical storm with 113 km/h winds to category 4, and then to category 5. This process, known as rapid intensification, occurs when winds increase by at least 56 km/h in 24 hours. The situation can surprise coastal residents and authorities, as happened with Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida in October. Despite not being predicted to directly impact large urban areas, Erin is expected to cause heavy rainfall in the Caribbean, the US Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico until Sunday (17). In isolated areas, precipitation may reach 15 cm, increasing the risk of flash flooding and landslides in mountainous areas.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 10:06 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mundo/furacao-erin-se-intensifica-e-atinge-a-categoria-5-no-atlantico-fenomeno-e-raro/)\n\n**Atlantic Season's First Hurricane 'Erin' Reaches Category Five**\nHurricane 'Erin', the first of the Atlantic season, has strengthened in the last hours to reach category five on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of approximately 260 kilometers per hour.

According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), as of Saturday morning (August 16), Erin has intensified into a devastating Category 5 hurricane. The storm is currently located 105 miles (170 km) north of Anguilla, with maximum sustained winds of nearly 160 mph (255 km/h). Some areas have entered a state of flood warning, and the US East Coast may experience strong waves and currents as early as next week. Dan Pydynowski, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, said, 'We still expect the hurricane to eventually turn north and remain offshore of the US East Coast, which is undoubtedly good news for dealing with such a powerful storm.' Michael Lowry, a hurricane expert at WPLG-TV, stated that Erin is the fifth hurricane to form in the Atlantic hurricane season to reach Category 5 strength so early, and the only Category 5 hurricane observed outside of the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea this year. According to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, Category 5 hurricanes have the lowest wind speed of 157 mph. The NHC predicts that Erin's size (coverage area) will at least double by mid-week, making the sea conditions in the western Atlantic Ocean worse. 'We expect the storm surge from Erin to affect the northern Leeward Islands, the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands by the weekend. The storm surge will spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the US East Coast by early next week.' The NHC also predicts that the storm will turn west-northwest by Saturday evening and then north by the weekend, passing north of the Caribbean Sea islands. 'We expect the storm to eventually turn north and remain offshore of the US East Coast, which is undoubtedly good news for dealing with such a powerful storm.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 06:04 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/8/16/n14574878.htm)\n\n**Erin Becomes First Category 5 Hurricane of 2025 Atlantic Hurricane Season**\nErin has become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, strengthening into a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that as of Saturday morning, Erin had intensified into a 5th category hurricane. The storm is currently located 105 miles north of Anguilla, with maximum sustained winds of nearly 160 mph. Some areas have entered a state of flood warning, and the US East Coast may experience strong waves and currents as early as next week. The NHC stated that 'it is expected that by next week, Erin's size (coverage area) will at least double, making the sea conditions in the western Atlantic Ocean worse.' The center also stated that the storm's surge will affect the northern Leeward Islands, US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Turks and Caicos Islands over the weekend. The surge is expected to spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the US East Coast early next week. Erin may intensify on Sunday morning. The storm's outer rain bands may bring 2-4 inches of rain to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands on Saturday and Sunday, potentially causing flash flooding and landslides. Although Erin is not expected to directly hit the US, it will still cause hazardous sea conditions along the US East Coast. By Saturday evening, Erin is expected to turn northwest and then north, passing north of the Caribbean islands. 'We still expect the hurricane to eventually turn more north and remain offshore of the US East Coast. This is undoubtedly good news for dealing with such a powerful storm,' said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski in an interview with USA TODAY. Michael Lowry, a hurricane expert at WPLG-TV, stated that Erin is the fifth hurricane in recorded history to form as a Category 5 hurricane this early in the season, and the only Category 5 hurricane observed outside of the US Gulf or Caribbean Sea this year. According to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, Category 5 hurricanes have the lowest wind speed of 157 mph. The Saffir-Simpson scale ranks hurricanes from Category 1 to Category 5, with Category 5 being the strongest.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 06:00 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/8/16/n14574878.htm)\n\n**Hurricane Erin Reaches Catastrophic Category 5, Threatens Caribbean Islands**\nThe hurricane Erin has reached category 5, the highest on the scale, and is rapidly intensifying over the northeastern Caribbean on Saturday (16). The phenomenon is causing rough seas, heavy rainfall, and strong gusts of wind in nearby islands, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in the United States. Erin has reached the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson scale after registering winds of approximately 257 km/h, making it a 'catastrophic' phenomenon, according to the US national agency. The hurricane has rapidly grown in strength, with winds increasing by 137 km/h in just 24 hours. The abnormal warming of the Atlantic has fueled the system's strengthening, and meteorologists predict new fluctuations in intensity over the weekend. Although there is no forecast for a direct impact on the areas, storm warnings have been issued due to the risk of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and hazardous sea currents. The NHC predicts that Erin will move northward over the Atlantic next week, moving away from the United States and Bermuda. Despite the predictions, a change in trajectory is not ruled out. Even without hitting the continent, the hurricane is expected to cause rough seas and hazardous currents in the Bahamas, the eastern coast of the US, and Canada. This marks the first major hurricane of the current Atlantic season, which began on June 1. Traditionally, the first hurricane of the year occurs around August 11, making Erin slightly delayed compared to the historical average, according to CNN. The US Coast Guard has already closed the ports of St. Thomas and St. John in the US Virgin Islands, as well as six ports in Puerto Rico, as a preventive measure. The rough seas and strong winds are expected to continue affecting the region until the start of next week. Meteorologists note that the most intense period of the hurricane season is from mid-August to October, and predictions for 2025 indicate above-average activity in the Atlantic.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 04:45 PM\nSource:[\u00daltimo Segundo](https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/mundo/2025-08-16/furacao-erin-atinge-a-catastrofica-categoria-5-diz-agencia.html)\n\n**Hurricane Erin Reaches Category 4, Brings Maximum Alert to Caribbean Islands**\nHurricane Erin has reached category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of over 210 km/h, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The rapid intensification and potential impact on the Caribbean islands have put them on maximum alert. 'Erin, category 4, continues to rapidly intensify. The outer rain bands are starting to affect the Northern Leeward Islands,' the hurricane center said. The authorities warn that the outer rain bands of Erin could generate intense rainfall, high surf, strong gusts, and rip currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, the eastern coast of the US, and the Atlantic coast of Canada next week. They recommend that the population stay alert to official reports and follow the instructions of the civil protection agency. The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be one of the most active in recent years, and Erin is one of the most intense storms recorded in the region so far.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 02:22 PM\nSource:[24 Horas](https://24-horas.mx/mexico/erin-se-convierte-en-huracan-de-categoria-4-en-el-atlantico/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all experts, the consensus is that it is unlikely\u2014though more plausible than in most years\u2014that another hurricane stronger than Erin (160 mph) will occur before December 1, 2025. Historically, it is quite rare for more than one >160 mph (Category 5) hurricane to occur in a single Atlantic season, with base rates typically in the single-digit percent range. That said, experts observe that sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic are at or near record levels, the season is already hyperactive, and recent years have demonstrated several seasons with multiple Category 5 hurricanes (sometimes exceeding 160 mph), likely linked to climate change and increases in oceanic heat content. \n\nCurrent and forecasted storms, notably Humberto and the developing Imelda, offer a real (though still minority) chance of exceeding Erin\u2019s intensity, especially with the possibility of a rare Fujiwhara effect (storm interaction) that could lead to rapid intensification. Most model guidance keeps current storms just below the 160 mph threshold, and after the season\u2019s climatological peak (mid-September), the odds of new super-intense hurricanes diminish, though notable precedents for late-season monsters exist.\n\nProbabilistic assessments mostly range between 15% and 35% (median/mode around low-to-mid 20s percent), reflecting a significant elevation above historical norms but still less than even odds. The balance of opinion: while the background risk this year is higher than normal due to warm SSTs, a very active season, and some model/forecast uncertainty, the extreme threshold (more than 160 mph) and base rate rarity keep the majority view against a Yes outcome. Most believe the most likely scenario is that Erin remains the strongest hurricane, but there is a non-trivial 'tail risk' that current or future storms could surpass this mark, especially in the next few weeks.",
