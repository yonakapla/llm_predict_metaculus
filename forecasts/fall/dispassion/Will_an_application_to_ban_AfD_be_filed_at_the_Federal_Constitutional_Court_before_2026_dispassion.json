Public opposition is substantial, and some key actors in government and the Bundestag remain skeptical or opposed, fearing unintended electoral consequences. Crucially, time is very short to complete internal reviews, gather evidence, and achieve the necessary formal decisions within major organs (Bundestag, Bundesrat, or government). Although the possibility is higher than at any previous point since the AfD's founding, the logistical and legal hurdles for filing an application before January 1, 2026 remain formidable.

The SPD's language is strong, but the official process is still in the preparatory stage, and their own statements indicate they will only file if prospects for success are clear.

Social Movement Theory suggests that when political opportunity structures shift\u2014such as through mass protests, elite defection, or legitimacy crises\u2014previously rigid institutional routines can become more permeable. While status quo bias and procedural caution are real, the intense and sustained mobilization against the AfD, combined with a potential tipping point in elite consensus (particularly if a symbolic incident or new evidence surfaces), could compress timelines and induce a window for action. This does not negate the high bar, but it means that the probability should not be anchored too strictly to past ban attempts (e.g., NPD), where movement pressure and public salience were lower. The legal system, though conservative, is still embedded in a dynamic social context that can produce rapid shifts\u2014especially when actors perceive existential threats to democracy. Thus, while 43% may be on the higher end, a modest upward adjustment from your 30% could better account for these sociopolitical dynamics."

It highlights the 2025 parliamentary elections in Moldova, where President Maia Sandu\u2019s Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) won 50.20% of the vote, with 78.5% of diaspora votes\u2014mostly in EU countries\u2014providing a decisive advantage. The opposition faced legal disqualification, mass detentions, and allegations of orchestrated suppression. Similarly, in Romania, the Constitutional Court annulled the first round of the 2024 presidential election after C\u0103lin Georgescu, a Eurosceptic candidate, led with 22.94%, citing alleged foreign interference. Georgescu was later barred from the re-run, which was won by pro-European candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan. In France, Marine Le Pen was convicted in March 2025 of embezzling EU funds, sentenced to four years (two suspended), fined \u20ac100,000, and disqualified from public office for five years\u2014effectively barring her from the 2027 presidential election. In Germany, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a 'far-right extremist' organization on 2 May 2025, based on a 1,000-page report, despite the party\u2019s rise to 20.8% of the vote and 152 seats in the Bundestag. The SPD has since initiated efforts to ban the AfD via the Federal Constitutional Court. The author contends these cases reveal a systemic pattern: when political competition threatens Brussels-aligned elites, legal mechanisms are weaponized to suppress opposition, transforming the EU\u2019s democratic facade into a 'simulacrum' of pluralism. The article concludes that the EU\u2019s institutional architecture is failing to address core challenges and is increasingly authoritarian in practice.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 08:10 PM\nSource:[The Duran](https://theduran.com/agony-of-eu-political-pluralism-how-brussels-buries-democratic-principles/)\n\n**Nationwide Coalition Mobilizes Against AfD Youth Re-Founding in Gie\u00dfen**\nA nationwide coalition named 'widersetzen' is mobilizing against the planned re-establishment of the AfD youth organization in Gie\u00dfen on November 29\u201330, 2025. The coalition, representing over 80 cities and including unions, antifascist groups, and NGOs, argues that a youth wing of the far-right AfD must not exist due to its ties to violent groups. Protest actions include road blockades of access routes to the Messe Gie\u00dfen, with only emergency vehicles permitted through. The group plans mass mobilization via buses from across Germany, aiming to surpass the 15,000 attendees and 200 buses that disrupted the AfD\u2019s 2024 party congress in Riesa. Police anticipate up to 40,000 demonstrators over two days and are preparing for multiple scenarios, though no concrete calls for violence have been reported. The coalition emphasizes non-escalation, stating it seeks only to prevent the event. The new AfD youth group, expected to be radicalized under the influence of Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, may adopt names such as 'Patriotische Jugend' or 'Junge Alternative'. H\u00f6cke, a central figure in the party\u2019s v\u00f6lkisch-nationalist wing, is highly popular among young right-wing members and has promoted radical ideas, including a controversial reference to the Hitler Youth motto. The likely new federal chairman, Jean-Pascal Hohm (28), is a Brandenburg state MP with a history of far-right affiliations and is considered a right-wing extremist by the state\u2019s constitutional protection agency. Another potential figure, Manuel Krauthausen, is a Bundestag member with a past involvement in racist online chats. Despite internal debates within the AfD about moderating the youth wing, the leadership appears unlikely to distance itself from radical elements, raising concerns that the new youth organization will continue the legacy of the banned Junge Alternative (JA), which had 2,400 members and allowed non-AfD members. The reorganization aims to integrate youth under the parent party, with automatic membership or an AfD party book required for those under a certain age.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:52 PM\nSource:[taz.de](https://taz.de/AfD-Jugend-gruendet-sich-in-Giessen-neu/!6117457/)\n\n**German Social Democrats Prepare Application to Ban 'Alternative for Germany'**\nMembers of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) are increasingly calling for the preparation of a formal application to ban the far-right party 'Alternative for Germany' (AfD). According to a joint statement from SPD parliamentary faction representatives in state parliaments and the Bundestag, as reported by dpa, such a ban is not a political attack but a necessary intervention to protect democracy, grounded in historical experience and the foundational principles of a functioning democracy. SPD policymakers justify the move by citing the AfD's increasing radicalization, spread of disinformation, support for right-wing extremist networks, and promotion of a platform that deliberately undermines core constitutional values. The 'Berlin Declaration for Democracy' calls for immediate preparation of a ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court, starting with gathering and evaluating evidence of the party's anti-constitutional activities. If the assessment indicates a viable case, there is an obligation to file the application. Only the Federal Constitutional Court can decide on banning a party, and the application must be submitted by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or federal government. In spring 2025, federal and state interior ministers agreed to establish a federal-state working group to combat the AfD, which has since been formed. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD as a confirmed right-wing extremist organization, though the party is challenging this classification in the Administrative Court of Cologne, where the classification remains temporarily suspended until the case is resolved.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 02:35 PM\nSource:[\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2025/10/2/7221563/)\n\n**SPD Legal Experts Urge AfD Ban Procedure Amid Broader Political Reforms**\nSPD legal experts are calling for the initiation of a formal procedure to ban the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, arguing that such a move is not a political attack but a necessary democratic safeguard rooted in historical experience and the principles of a resilient democracy. In a joint statement titled the 'Berlin Declaration for Democracy,' SPD parliamentary spokespersons from the Bundestag and state parliaments emphasize the urgent need to prepare a ban application for review by the Federal Constitutional Court. They state that if the review indicates a potential success, the application must be filed. The legal process must be accompanied by continued political engagement with the AfD. Only the Federal Constitutional Court can decide on a party ban, which can be initiated by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or federal government. Federal Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) opposes the move, arguing it would benefit the AfD by giving it more visibility, and instead advocates for 'governing the AfD out of existence.' The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution classified the AfD as a confirmed right-wing extremist organization in early May, though this designation was temporarily suspended due to an ongoing legal challenge by the AfD. The article also covers other political developments, including the federal cabinet's first retreat focusing on modernization, economic competitiveness, and digitalization; plans for a unified vehicle registration portal; a proposed drone defense center; and debates on social media restrictions for minors under 16. Additionally, the article mentions the health of Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder, who collapsed during the retreat and was hospitalized, and the broader political context of Germany's economic and social reforms.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 11:19 AM\nSource:[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bundesregierung-liveblog-spd-afd-verbot-verfahren-li.3315943)\n\n**Voter Intentions: How Citizens Would Vote in a Hypothetical Bundestag Election**\nA daily updated overview of the 'Sunday question' from German polling institutes such as Forsa and Infratest dimap reveals current voter intentions for a hypothetical Bundestag election. The RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) calculates the average of the last ten surveys. After the 2021 Bundestag election, the SPD initially led in polls but was soon overtaken by the CDU/CSU. The Greens' post-election surge lasted longer, but they too lost support over time. The FDP also declined, ultimately failing to cross the 5% threshold in the 2025 Bundestag election. The largest beneficiary of the decline of the coalition parties (SPD, Greens, FDP) was the AfD, which rose to become the second-strongest party in polls by mid-2023. However, the AfD lost some ground in early 2024. During this period, pollsters first included the new party BSW (B\u00fcndnis Sahra Wagenknecht), which narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving just under 5% of voter support. The latest poll and results from recent federal, eastern German (Thuringia, Saxony, Brandenburg), and European elections are displayed in a graphic.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 04:03 AM\nSource:[rnd.de](https://www.rnd.de/politik/umfragen-zu-parteien-aktuelle-trends-fuer-spd-union-afd-gruene-und-co-3-10-2025-462SFUR3SNBCLN3ACXRFNANNSE.html)\n\n**Far-Right AfD Ties for First in German Poll Amid Declining Government Approval and Democratic Concerns**\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has tied with the conservative CDU/CSU coalition\u2014led by federal chancellor Friedrich Merz\u2014for first place in the Deutschlandtrend poll conducted by Infratest Dimap and broadcast by ARD, with both parties scoring 26% support. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) follows with 15%, the Greens with 12%, and The Left with 10%. The AfD gained one percentage point from the previous month, achieving its highest result ever in the Deutschlandtrend survey, while the CDU/CSU lost one point. The SPD remained unchanged, the Greens rose by one point, and The Left stayed stable. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) each scored 3%, below the 5% threshold needed to gain seats in the Bundestag. The federal government coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD) faces low approval, with 77% of voters expressing little or no satisfaction\u2014its lowest level since the government took office in May. The AfD benefits from this dissatisfaction. On the 35th anniversary of German reunification, 61% of respondents expressed satisfaction with reunification, while 34% were dissatisfied. Satisfaction was higher in western Germany (64%) than in eastern Germany (50%), where 46% were dissatisfied. The poll surveyed 1,306 German voters between September 29 and October 1, with a margin of error between 2% and 3%. Only 42% of voters are satisfied with the state of democracy in Germany, while 56% are dissatisfied\u2014especially among AfD supporters (91%). Among AfD supporters, the main perceived threats to democracy are dysfunctional political institutions (35%) and migration (16%). In contrast, supporters of other Bundestag parties identify right-wing extremism and populism as the top threat: 63% of Greens, 52% of The Left, 51% of SPD, and 39% of CDU/CSU voters cited this first. Disfunctional institutions were also seen as a major threat by traditional party supporters, though at lower rates than among AfD supporters.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 02:32 AM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/mundo/ultradireita-alcanca-1-lugar-em-pesquisa-na-alemanha)\n\n**AGONY OF EU POLITICAL PLURALISM: HOW BRUSSELS BURIES DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES**\nThe article argues that the European Union is undermining democratic principles by systematically suppressing political pluralism, particularly in post-Soviet and core EU countries.

Similarly, in Romania, the Constitutional Court annulled the first round of the 2024 presidential election after C\u0103lin Georgescu, a Eurosceptic candidate, led with 22.94%, citing alleged foreign interference. Georgescu was later barred from the re-run, which was won by pro-European candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan. In France, Marine Le Pen was convicted in March 2025 of embezzling EU funds, sentenced to four years (two suspended), fined \u20ac100,000, and disqualified from public office for five years\u2014effectively barring her from the 2027 presidential election. In Germany, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a 'far-right extremist' organization on 2 May 2025, based on a 1,000-page report, despite the party\u2019s rise to 20.8% of the vote and 152 seats in the Bundestag. The SPD has since initiated efforts to ban the AfD via the Federal Constitutional Court. The author contends these cases reveal a systemic pattern: when political competition threatens Brussels-aligned elites, legal mechanisms are weaponized to suppress opposition, transforming the EU\u2019s democratic facade into a 'simulacrum' of pluralism. The article concludes that the EU\u2019s institutional architecture is failing to address core challenges and is increasingly authoritarian in practice.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 08:10 PM\nSource:[The Duran](https://theduran.com/agony-of-eu-political-pluralism-how-brussels-buries-democratic-principles/)\n\n**Nationwide Coalition Mobilizes Against AfD Youth Re-Founding in Gie\u00dfen**\nA nationwide coalition named 'widersetzen' is mobilizing against the planned re-establishment of the AfD youth organization in Gie\u00dfen on November 29\u201330, 2025. The coalition, representing over 80 cities and including unions, antifascist groups, and NGOs, argues that a youth wing of the far-right AfD must not exist due to its ties to violent groups. Protest actions include road blockades of access routes to the Messe Gie\u00dfen, with only emergency vehicles permitted through. The group plans mass mobilization via buses from across Germany, aiming to surpass the 15,000 attendees and 200 buses that disrupted the AfD\u2019s 2024 party congress in Riesa. Police anticipate up to 40,000 demonstrators over two days and are preparing for multiple scenarios, though no concrete calls for violence have been reported. The coalition emphasizes non-escalation, stating it seeks only to prevent the event. The new AfD youth group, expected to be radicalized under the influence of Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, may adopt names such as 'Patriotische Jugend' or 'Junge Alternative'. H\u00f6cke, a central figure in the party\u2019s v\u00f6lkisch-nationalist wing, is highly popular among young right-wing members and has promoted radical ideas, including a controversial reference to the Hitler Youth motto. The likely new federal chairman, Jean-Pascal Hohm (28), is a Brandenburg state MP with a history of far-right affiliations and is considered a right-wing extremist by the state\u2019s constitutional protection agency. Another potential figure, Manuel Krauthausen, is a Bundestag member with a past involvement in racist online chats. Despite internal debates within the AfD about moderating the youth wing, the leadership appears unlikely to distance itself from radical elements, raising concerns that the new youth organization will continue the legacy of the banned Junge Alternative (JA), which had 2,400 members and allowed non-AfD members. The reorganization aims to integrate youth under the parent party, with automatic membership or an AfD party book required for those under a certain age.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:52 PM\nSource:[taz.de](https://taz.de/AfD-Jugend-gruendet-sich-in-Giessen-neu/!6117457/)\n\n**German Social Democrats Prepare Application to Ban 'Alternative for Germany'**\nMembers of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) are increasingly calling for the preparation of a formal application to ban the far-right party 'Alternative for Germany' (AfD). According to a joint statement from SPD parliamentary faction representatives in state parliaments and the Bundestag, as reported by dpa, such a ban is not a political attack but a necessary intervention to protect democracy, grounded in historical experience and the foundational principles of a functioning democracy. SPD policymakers justify the move by citing the AfD's increasing radicalization, spread of disinformation, support for right-wing extremist networks, and promotion of a platform that deliberately undermines core constitutional values. The 'Berlin Declaration for Democracy' calls for immediate preparation of a ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court, starting with gathering and evaluating evidence of the party's anti-constitutional activities. If the assessment indicates a viable case, there is an obligation to file the application. Only the Federal Constitutional Court can decide on banning a party, and the application must be submitted by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or federal government. In spring 2025, federal and state interior ministers agreed to establish a federal-state working group to combat the AfD, which has since been formed. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD as a confirmed right-wing extremist organization, though the party is challenging this classification in the Administrative Court of Cologne, where the classification remains temporarily suspended until the case is resolved.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 02:35 PM\nSource:[\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2025/10/2/7221563/)\n\n**Administrative Court Rules in Favor of AfD in Hechingen Stadthalle Dispute Over 2026 Party Congress**\nThe Administrative Court ruled in favor of the AfD in a dispute over the use of Hechingen's Stadthalle for its planned regional party congress on November 8\u20139, 2026, stating that the city's amendment to the hall's usage regulations violated the party's right to equal treatment in political competition. The city had changed the rules in September 2025, banning federal and state-level party events from October 2025 onward, citing increased security demands and the risk of overburdening the venue. The AfD had already secured a lease for the hall in August 2025, but the city canceled the contract after the rule change. The court's decision is not yet legally binding; the city of Hechingen has two weeks from receipt to file an appeal. AfD Co-Chairman Emil S\u00e4nze welcomed the ruling, saying 'the principles of the rule of law have prevailed.' The city also raised concerns about the timing of the event\u2014November 9, 2026, coinciding with the anniversary of the Reichspogromnacht\u2014labeling it a 'right-wing extremist suspect case' under the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution.

In a joint statement titled the 'Berlin Declaration for Democracy,' SPD parliamentary spokespersons from the Bundestag and state parliaments emphasize the urgent need to prepare a ban application for review by the Federal Constitutional Court. They state that if the review indicates a potential success, the application must be filed. The legal process must be accompanied by continued political engagement with the AfD. Only the Federal Constitutional Court can decide on a party ban, which can be initiated by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or federal government. Federal Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) opposes the move, arguing it would benefit the AfD by giving it more visibility, and instead advocates for 'governing the AfD out of existence.' The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution classified the AfD as a confirmed right-wing extremist organization in early May, though this designation was temporarily suspended due to an ongoing legal challenge by the AfD. The article also covers other political developments, including the federal cabinet's first retreat focusing on modernization, economic competitiveness, and digitalization; plans for a unified vehicle registration portal; a proposed drone defense center; and debates on social media restrictions for minors under 16.

The community was shocked upon discovering the truth, prompting public outcry and intervention from Stiftsamtfrau Eva-Maria Menard, the superior of Pastor Kautz and overall responsible for the site. Menard stated that Tute, representing a party classified by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution as right-wing extremist and anti-constitutional in its 2024 report, and deemed 'inhuman' by the Evangelical Church, violated the community\u2019s values. As a result, the Stiftskapitel demanded Tute vacate the premises and terminate his lease by August 31, 2025. The incident has sparked internal and external debates within the church about how to handle AfD members and functionaries. The Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-schlesische Oberlausitz, to which Pastor Kautz belongs, had previously, in 2024, passed a resolution at its Landessynode in G\u00f6rlitz banning AfD members from serving in parish church councils, citing the party\u2019s 'unholy alliance' with right-wing extremists who actively undermine democracy and the rule of law.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 11:09 AM\nSource:[Berliner Morgenpost](https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410139875/afd-mann-in-kloster-gemeinschaft-so-reagiert-die-leitung.html)\n\n**Geoff Russ: Geert Wilders' coming triumph and the end of Europe's mushy centrists**\nIn the Netherlands, nationalist right-wing party the Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, is poised to win the upcoming snap election, with current polls projecting it and its right-wing rival JA21 to secure nearly half the seats in parliament. This follows a rapid rise from political margins to the center of power across Europe, driven by widespread frustration over mass immigration, housing shortages, and the rising cost of living. Despite the PVV's 2023 coalition agreement collapsing, Wilders remains a dominant political figure, even as mainstream parties like the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) face their weakest electoral performance since the 1970s. In France, the National Rally (RN) has gained momentum, winning significant support from disaffected blue-collar workers and youth, though it was blocked from power in 2024 through strategic withdrawals by centrist parties. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) has become the second-largest party and now leads in polls. In the UK, Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK is gaining ground in former Labour strongholds. Across Europe, voters are rejecting traditional centrist and establishment parties, which are seen as failing to address immigration, energy costs, and stagnant wages. Energy prices in the Netherlands are projected to triple by 2040 due to reduced natural gas supply and strict environmental regulations, while housing shortages have driven rent hikes and made the country one of the most unaffordable in Europe. According to the article, the EU\u2019s political establishment has lost legitimacy due to its inability to address these issues, and the rise of nationalist parties reflects a demand for change rather than consensus. The author argues that continued attempts to block nationalist coalitions through fragile alliances only delay the inevitable shift toward populist governance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/geoff-russ-geert-wilders-coming-100010821.html)\n\n**Germany\u2019s Far\u2011Right AfD Surges in Polls Amid Calls for Ban**\nGermany\u2019s far\u2011right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has risen sharply in recent polls, now polling 30\u202f% in a June 2024 survey by Insa, up from 20.8\u202f% in the 2021 elections. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) sits at 27\u202f%, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) trails at 7\u202f%.

The survey found that 43% of respondents expect AfD to be the strongest party in the next election, while 39% disagree and 18% were unsure. 56% of respondents believe that AfD will increase its influence on voters before the election, and 47% think that the ruling coalition CDU/CSU should continue to refuse cooperation with AfD. The survey was conducted among 1006 respondents and has a margin of error that is not specified. In April and August, AfD surpassed the Christian Democratic and Christian Social Unions (CDU/CSU) and became the most popular party in Germany. In 2023, the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) recognized AfD's branches in Saxony, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt as right-wing extremist. On the federal level, the party was only suspected of extremism until recently, which is considered a lower threat. AfD's leaders, Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel, called the party's recognition as a right-wing extremist organization a blow to democratic institutions. The party has filed a lawsuit against the BfV and has accused the German authorities of persecution and suppressing dissent.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250817/vybory-2035843134.html)\n\n**AfD Surpasses CDU/CSU in Popularity in Germany, According to Recent Poll**\nA recent Forsa poll for RTL and N-TV has shown that the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has surpassed the CDU/CSU block in popularity in Germany, with 24% of respondents supporting the block and 25% supporting the AfD. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) continues to hover around 13% support, while the Greens and the Left party have 13% and 11% support respectively. The FDP and other parties have 3% and 6% support respectively. The poll also shows that 25% of respondents are either undecided or did not vote, a significant increase from the 17.9% who did not vote in the recent Bundestag elections. The approval rating for Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dropped to a new low, with only 29% of respondents satisfied with his work, a three-point decrease from the last poll. 'This is the worst result since his election in May. Disapproval has increased by three points to 67%', said the sociologists. The AfD was founded in 2013 as a eurosceptic party and has been known for its pro-Russian and far-right views. In May 2025, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution classified the AfD as a right-wing extremist party. Thousands of people protested against the AfD in May, calling for its ban. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, German Justice Minister Stephanie Hubig said that the party should be considered for a ban. 'The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is convinced that AfD is 'unconditionally right-wing extremist'. Therefore, we must take this party very seriously as a potential threat to our democracy. This, of course, includes considering the question of banning the party', she said.

The survey found that residents of eastern Germany are particularly opposed to the ban, with two-thirds of respondents disagreeing with it. Many respondents believe that even if the AfD is banned, a new party with similar views will quickly emerge. The survey also notes that 67% of western Germans and 88% of eastern Germans personally know someone who supports the AfD, which may reduce support for banning the party. Additionally, many believe that the parties seeking to ban the AfD are primarily motivated by a desire to eliminate a strong competitor. According to the survey, the potential support for the AfD has grown from 22% in 2023 to 33% in 2025, particularly in eastern Germany (47%). The survey was conducted from July 4 to 16, 2025, and involved 1054 participants. The potential error margin is not specified. In 2023, the German federal agency for the protection of the constitution recognized the AfD's branches in Saxony, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt as extremist. In May 2025, the agency declared the AfD extremist nationwide, allowing for increased surveillance and considered a step towards banning the party, which had previously surpassed the winning coalition of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union in several polls. The co-leaders of the AfD, Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel, called the agency's decision a blow to democracy. The AfD subsequently filed a lawsuit against the agency, which temporarily suspended the extremist designation. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz commented on the possibility of banning the AfD, stating that it would be impossible to ban 10 million of its supporters and emphasizing the need to review the previous decision to recognize the party as extremist.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 19, 2025 12:52 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250719/opros-2030157767.html)\n\n**Germans Oppose Ban on Far-Right Party 'Alternative for Germany'**\nA recent survey found that 52% of Germans oppose banning the far-right party 'Alternative for Germany' (AfD), while 27% support the ban.

The AfD has a strong base of support in eastern Germany. The survey found that the main reason for opposing the ban is the perceived bias in the media, with 67% of respondents in western Germany and 88% in eastern Germany stating that their acquaintances support the AfD. Many respondents view these acquaintances as more sympathetic than the party itself. Another reason for opposing the ban is the perception that the parties calling for it are trying to eliminate a strong competitor in the political landscape. The calls for banning the AfD have increased after the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) classified the party as 'extreme right-wing' and 'certain', allowing for greater flexibility in monitoring the party. The BfV has since suspended the classification pending a court decision on the party's appeal. It is worth noting that only the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat can request a ban on the party before the Federal Constitutional Court. The AfD, known for its anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and eurosceptic rhetoric, has been a source of tension in German politics for over a decade.

The main reason for this opposition is that many Germans are familiar with AfD supporters, with 67% of western Germans and 88% of eastern Germans knowing someone who supports the party. These individuals are viewed more positively than the party itself. Another reason for the opposition is that many respondents believe that the parties pushing for the ban are simply trying to eliminate a difficult competitor in the political arena. The calls for a ban on the party have increased since the federal intelligence agency classified AfD as a 'recognized ultra-right extremist' organization, giving them more freedom to monitor the party's activities. However, this classification is currently being challenged in court by AfD. The Constitutional Court of Germany is the highest authority in deciding on any ban. AfD, known for its anti-immigration, anti-Muslim, eurosceptic, and nationalist rhetoric, has been a hot topic in German politics for over a decade. In recent years, the party has gained strength by capitalizing on economic discontent and growing public concern about immigration.

The party has been classified as an extremist organization by the national intelligence agency, and a recent report by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) has exposed its racist and anti-Muslim views. The AfD has received significant support from the Trump administration, and its popularity has increased to 26% in some polls, making it briefly the most popular party in the country. However, the path to prohibiting the AfD is long and largely unprecedented. The German system of government is based on the concept of 'streitbare Demokratie' or 'militant democracy', which allows the state to defend itself against internal threats to its democratic principles and constitutional order. To prohibit a party, the Federal Constitutional Court must determine that it acts against the free democratic order, showing an aggressive and bellicose stance, and that it represents a tangible threat to democracy. The court has only prohibited two parties in the country's history, and the process is considered a measure of last resort against enemies of democracy. Some lawmakers are divided on the issue, with some fearing that prohibition could be counterproductive and fuel the sympathies of the far-right.

A formal request must be made to the federal court, which would then decide whether to begin proceedings or throw out the application. If the AfD were to be banned, its sitting lawmakers would receive an automatic loss of mandate, and its seats in the Bundestag and European Parliament would remain vacant.

The SPD adopted a special resolution at its national congress, calling on the parliament and government to initiate the procedure for recognizing AfD as unconstitutional as soon as possible. The resolution states: 'With a party that abuses democratic principles to fight democracy from within, fair competition is impossible. Any attempt to include them in the democratic discourse will lead to nothing. It is now time for competent constitutional bodies to create conditions for an immediate statement on the submission of an application for the unconstitutionality of AfD.' EADaily notes that two months ago, the German counter-intelligence agency declared AfD an 'extremist organization', assessing it as a 'threat to democracy'. So far, this status has only been applied to the party's regional structures in Thuringia, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. The entire party was simply classified as 'suspected of extremism'. In response, AfD filed a lawsuit against the counter-intelligence agency and accused the outgoing federal government of conducting a 'politically motivated smear campaign'. However, many German politicians have noted that the attempt to ban AfD may only strengthen it and bring it more support. Experts also point to the uncertain outcome of a possible court hearing, citing a recent decision by the Federal Administrative Court of Germany, which overturned the ban on the 'Compact' magazine associated with AfD.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 30, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[EADaily](https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2025/06/30/sdpg-hochet-zapretit-partiyu-alternativa-dlya-germanii)\n\n**German Social Democrats Plan to Ban Far-Right AfD Party**\nThe German Social Democratic Party plans to move forward with efforts to ban the far-right 'Alternative for Germany' (AfD) party.

The proposal states, 'It is time for the constitutional bodies to prepare the ground for a swift request to the Federal Constitutional Court to declare the AfD party unconstitutional.' The party's leader, Berlina Pas, expressed her support for the proposal, saying, 'We must now clarify whether there are sufficient grounds to submit a proposal to the Federal Constitutional Court to declare the AfD party unconstitutional.' She added that if such evidence is found, 'as a social democratic party, we have a democratic duty to do our utmost to ensure that a proposal to ban the party can be submitted.' The AfD party has been known for its anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric, as well as its skepticism towards the European Union and its advocacy for nationalism. The party has gained momentum in recent years by exploiting economic discontent and growing concerns about immigration. It is now the largest opposition party in Germany. Calls for banning the AfD party have increased after the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution reclassified the party as a 'right-wing extremist group' in May, allowing for expanded surveillance. However, the office has since decided to suspend this classification pending a court review, and will treat the party as a 'suspected right-wing extremist group' until a court ruling is made.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 06:48 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=29062025&id=5434e9a0-8592-47e2-be8c-15a15858740d)\n\n",

    "summary": "The forecasts of eight experts from diverse but complementary backgrounds converge on a similar overall assessment: while momentum and legal preparations to ban the AfD (Alternative for Germany) have increased substantially in 2025\u2014driven primarily by the SPD (Social Democratic Party), pressure from civil society, and a federal/state working group\u2014the probability that a formal application will be filed with the German Federal Constitutional Court before January 1, 2026, remains below 50% and most likely is still less than one-third, with estimates clustering between 22% and 35%. One outlier (43%) highlights the importance of recent radicalization, civil society mobilization, and a heightened sense of urgency among political elites, but even this perspective acknowledges significant headwinds. \n\nThe experts' reasoning consistently identifies the following key barriers: (1) the historically high legal threshold and base rate for party bans in Germany (only two such bans in postwar history, with recent NPD ban attempts failing even with strong evidence); (2) the lack of a finalized legal foundation following the BfV\u2019s (intelligence agency\u2019s) currently suspended extremist classification of the AfD, pending court review; (3) public opinion, with a clear majority of Germans\u2014especially in eastern regions\u2014opposing a ban and elites fearing backlash or political martyrdom of the AfD; (4) the absence, as of early October 2025, of unified cross-party consensus or support within Bundestag, Bundesrat, or the federal government, with CDU/CSU and some government figures either opposed or highly cautious; (5) acute time pressure given less than three months remain, and the parliamentary and legal processes required are typically slow and consensus-driven.\n\nFactors that slightly increase the probability include strong SPD and Green/Left mobilization, intensified evidence-gathering and preparation, the legal and symbolic boost from the BfV\u2019s classification, and growing international precedent for action against radical right parties. Nonetheless, these are offset by deep-seated institutional, legal, and procedural caution\u2014echoed in every expert\u2019s scenario planning, with most \u2018yes\u2019 stories requiring a last-minute surge, crisis, legal breakthrough, or shift in elite consensus to materialize before the deadline. \n\nIn summary, the current environment is the closest Germany has come in decades to actually filing such a case, but experts overwhelmingly expect that, given the remaining barriers and the short timeline, it is still more likely than not that no application to ban the AfD will be filed before 2026.",
