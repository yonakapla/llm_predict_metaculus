Alternatively, a new inter-state or civil war breaks out elsewhere (e.g., a new front in the Middle East, or a new civil war in Africa or Asia) and quickly causes 5,000 deaths, with clear attribution and sufficient reporting to meet Metaculus\u2019s standards.",

The majority of current mass-lethal wars (Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, Ethiopia) are excluded by the resolution criteria due to high casualties in 2023/2024. DRC is the only plausible candidate for qualifying escalation, with news of mass displacement, increased violence, and significant casualties in 2025. However, DRC\u2019s chronic violence, overlapping conflicts, and poor data make it notoriously difficult to attribute deaths to a 'new' or 'substantially escalated' conflict as defined. While there is some chance that the M23 escalation will be judged to meet the threshold, the reporting is more focused on displacement and injury than confirmed mass fatalities, and the fine print suggests a high bar for clear attribution and credible death counts. No other region shows strong evidence of a qualifying new war. Therefore, while the probability is somewhat elevated compared to the historic base rate (due to DRC escalation and the global trend of increasing conflict), it remains below 50%.",

First, the sharp recent escalation in eastern DRC is not just signaled by displacement and amputee statistics, but also by concrete reports of mass-casualty attacks and a breakdown in regional diplomatic processes, both of which historically precede death toll surges. Second, reporting lags in these contexts can mean deaths occurring in mid-to-late 2025 are not confirmed until months later, resulting in a possible upward revision or late-breaking confirmation just before or after year-end. Thus, your forecast may be overly anchored on the lack of currently confirmed fatalities, underestimating the likelihood that subsequent data or Metaculus judgement could resolve this as Yes.

Many DRC escalations in past years have produced vast suffering without crossing mass-fatality thresholds in a single calendar year.

However, the key counterarguments\u2014especially from methodologies grounded in base rates and fine print\u2014emphasize the rarity of such qualifying escalations and the strict eligibility criteria (must be under 1,000 deaths in both 2023 and 2024). No forecaster has presented concrete evidence that 5,000+ deaths have occurred or are inevitable in 2025, and reporting on fatalities remains ambiguous. The time window is shrinking, and while the risk is elevated, there is still no clear, direct evidence that a qualifying conflict will cross the threshold by the end of 2025. The best arguments for a higher probability suggest a modest upward adjustment to reflect tail risk and the potential for undercounting, but not a dramatic change. I am therefore revising my probability slightly upward to reflect these points.",

However, the group was generally split between those emphasizing the base rate/status quo and those arguing for a significant tail risk due to lagged reporting and the unique volatility of 2024-2025. Critiques of higher probabilities (e.g., 40%+) were persuasive, noting that humanitarian signals (displacement, amputees) do not automatically equate to >5,000 combat deaths, and the eligibility criteria remain a substantial hurdle\u2014especially given ambiguous death tolls in prior years. My initial forecast (38%) was already in the upper-middle range, reflecting both the exceptional risk environment and the data ambiguity. On reflection, I see no strong reason to move higher, but the argument for a more cautious approach\u2014given the stickiness of the status quo and eligibility uncertainty\u2014warrants a modest downward revision. I will revise to 32%, reflecting a moderately elevated tail risk but increased skepticism that a qualifying conflict will both cross the threshold and be credibly confirmed by resolution time.",

Military and operational risk analysts highlighted that mass displacement and humanitarian crisis indicators, while not proof of mass fatalities, have historically preceded late-breaking confirmations of large-scale deaths in DRC, especially after reporting delays are resolved. At the same time, critiques from crisis early warning and civil war onset specialists emphasized the historical rarity of such sharp escalations and the strictness of the eligibility criteria, cautioning against overreacting to ambiguous humanitarian signals. Defenses of mid-range probabilities reinforced the importance of ambiguity and lag, but also the plausibility\u2014though not high likelihood\u2014of a qualifying event. Weighing these perspectives, especially the possibility that Metaculus or data providers might interpret ambiguous escalation in DRC as meeting the threshold late in the year, I see a modest case for an increase. However, I remain cautious given time constraints and the lack of clear evidence to date. I will revise my estimate upward, but only slightly, to better account for the tail risk highlighted by group deliberation.",

Multiple forecasters with operational risk and military analysis expertise (e.g., Military Analysis - 42%, Crisis Early Warning Operational Risk - 38%) emphasize the significance of the acute escalation in eastern DRC and the potential for late-year or retrospective reporting to push confirmed deaths over the 5,000 threshold. Critiques of more conservative forecasts (e.g., Crisis Early Warning Models at 18%) stress that humanitarian signals\u2014while imperfect\u2014have historically preceded mass-fatality events in DRC and similar theaters, and that Metaculus may resolve ambiguities in favor of a Yes if credible estimates emerge. However, the strict eligibility criteria and the persistent ambiguity in DRC death reporting still argue for substantial caution. The modal outcome is still No, but the weight of argument supports a slightly higher probability to reflect tail risk and the clustering of peer forecasts in the upper 30s.

The [Uppsala Conflict Data Program](https://ucdp.uu.se/) reports (visualized by OWID [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-in-armed-conflicts-by-type)) that each of 2021, 2022, and 2023 surpassed every year since 1989 in armed conflict deaths, with the exception of the [1994 Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":31273,\"question_id\":30917}}`",

        "fine_print": "* For a conflict to count it must have had fewer than 1,000 deaths in each of the calendar years 2023 and 2024.\n* At least 5,000 deaths have to happen within 2025.

Terrorist attacks will not - at least one party in the conflict must be the armed forces of a nation-state.\n* A conflict that has been overtly joined by at least one new state (including state military or militants from a new state) and takes place at a primarily different frontline will count as a separate conflict, even if a new state explicitly takes a side in an existing conflict.

If the frontlines are primarily the same, this question will resolve as **Yes** if the new state suffers at least 5,000 deaths in the conflict, when it had not suffered 1,000 deaths in the conflict previously. \"Overtly joined\" means that combatants from the country are clearly identifiable and, if they are members of the country's military, are acknowledged by that country to be involved in the conflict.\n* In cases where the reporting is ambiguous or the situation is complex, Metaculus may make a determination, and might resolve the question as **Ambiguous**.\n* In cases of ambiguity in the reporting of deaths, Metaculus might wait until January 31, 2026 to resolve this question.&#x20;",

More than 7 million people have been displaced. The Shirika la Umoja orthopedic center in Goma, supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross since 2005, has seen a dramatic increase in demand for prosthetics, treating over 800 amputees and other severely injured patients since early 2025. Prosthetic production rose from 422 in all of 2024 to 326 in just the first half of 2025. The center\u2019s staff, including prosthetic technicians like Julienne Paypay\u2014who lost her own leg as a child\u2014craft limbs by hand, each individually molded and assembled. Patients like Jerome Jean Claude Amani, who lost his wife and four children in a rebel attack, and Faustin Amani, who lost both legs in a military vehicle accident, describe their journeys of trauma and resilience. Amani said, 'I don\u2019t see my prosthetic as a weakness but as a victory,' reflecting a broader narrative of survival and hope amid devastation. Challenges remain due to imported materials, insecurity, airport disruptions, and new customs regulations, but the center continues to provide critical support to those rebuilding their lives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 07:41 AM\nSource:[Helena Independent Record](https://helenair.com/article_ee050b10-2134-5409-8076-14457169e33a.html)\n\n**The World Is a Genocide: A Critique of Global Inaction and the Erosion of Human Rights**\nThe article titled 'El mundo es un genocidio' argues that global violence and systemic failures have reduced the world to a state resembling genocide. It references high death tolls from drug use in the U.S. (97,231 in 2023), war casualties in Gaza (67,000 since 2023), Yemen (377,000 dead), and Ukraine (up to 1 million military and civilian deaths by 2024), while criticizing the UN for failing to act decisively. The author claims that the term 'genocide' is misused and diluted, pointing to historical oversights such as the UN's inaction during the Rwandan genocide (800,000 killed in 100 days) and the underreported violence in Venezuela (18,000 homicides in 2011), Nigeria (200 Christians killed in 2025), and Sri Lanka. The piece condemns the politicization of victimhood, accusing international actors of framing Israel as genocidal while ignoring Hamas\u2019s role in capturing Israeli civilians. It criticizes the UN\u2019s silence on global atrocities and accuses Western elites of using ideological polarization to justify violence. The author invokes Kofi Annan\u2019s 2005 UN report emphasizing that threats like terrorism, organized crime, and state violence are interconnected and that all people have a right to live without fear. Despite the UN\u2019s 1998 resolution linking terrorism to human rights violations, the author asserts that current international law is ineffective. The article concludes by quoting UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 warning that 'the planet is on the brink,' criticizing the UN\u2019s focus on climate and gender issues while ignoring ongoing genocidal violence. The author calls for a global moral response based on the principle of protecting human life and liberty.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:26 AM\nSource:[El Carabobe\u00f1o](https://www.el-carabobeno.com/el-mundo-es-un-genocidio/)\n\n**Global Pro-Palestinian Protests Surge Amid Escalating Gaza Conflict, UN Finds Genocide Evidence**\nAccording to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), nearly 48,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrations have taken place globally over the past two years since Israel's offensive in Gaza began on October 7, 2023. The data shows a 43% increase in protests between May and September 2025 compared to the previous five months, with 15% of all global demonstrations during this period being pro-Palestinian, occurring in 137 countries and territories. The largest concentrations of protests were in Yemen, Morocco, the United States, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, France, Italy, Spain, and Australia\u2014accounting for over 75% of the total. The vast majority of these demonstrations were peaceful, with only 1% resulting in violence. Regionally, 22,066 protests (46% of the total) occurred in the Middle East, followed by 8,298 in Europe and Central Asia (17%), 14% in Africa, 13% in the U.S. and Canada, 9% in Asia-Pacific, and 1% in Latin America and the Caribbean. ACLED attributes the surge in protests to ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza, which have led to over 67,000 Palestinian deaths according to Gaza authorities, widespread displacement, and severe humanitarian restrictions. The UN Human Rights Council\u2019s investigation concluded on September 16 that Israel committed acts of genocide in Gaza, citing at least four of the five acts defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention, including killings, severe physical and psychological harm, conditions aimed at destruction, and measures to prevent births. This conclusion was echoed by the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) on September 1. The report also notes a growing international backlash, including recognition of the State of Palestine by several Western allies of Israel\u2014such as the UK, France, Canada, and Australia\u2014drawing sharp criticism from Israel\u2019s government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the U.S. The offensive has also been marked by approximately 21,900 conflict events, second only to Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, with over 11,900 airstrikes and drone attacks. Gaza City (North) accounted for nearly 60% of Israeli military activity in September 2025, including extensive use of explosive robots\u2014over 110 since May 2024, with more than a third in Gaza City alone. ACLED reports that these robots, often repurposed armored vehicles loaded with explosives and remotely controlled, are used not only for attacks but also to intimidate civilians and force evacuations. Despite growing opposition within Israel\u2019s security apparatus, the political leadership continues to pursue a 'total victory' driven by ideological goals, aiming to degrade Hamas, block alternative Palestinian governance, and push Gaza toward uninhabitability to encourage migration and obstruct Palestinian sovereignty. Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that his government will not accept a Palestinian state, even after accepting a U.S. proposal from Donald Trump that envisions a credible path toward Palestinian self-determination and peaceful coexistence through dialogue.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:02 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-dos-anos-ofensiva-israel-contra-gaza-dejan-48000-movilizaciones-propalestinas-mundo-20251007010250.html)\n\n**Two Years of Genocide War in Gaza: Escalating Attacks on Palestinian Journalists**\nSince October 7, 2023, Palestinian journalists have faced escalating violence and systematic violations by Israeli forces and settlers, according to data from the Freedom Committee of the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate. The report documents 252 journalist fatalities in Gaza by October 2025, including 34 female journalists killed by Israeli military fire. The years 2023, 2024, and 2025 saw a sharp rise in attacks: 102 journalists killed in 2023, 91 in 2024, and 59 in early 2025. Over 1,000 journalists have been injured, with 63 in 2023, 86 in 2024, and 54 in 2025, including severe injuries such as amputations. Since the start of the conflict, 153 journalists have been arrested\u201448 in 2023, 69 in 2024, and 36 in early 2025. More than 150 media offices and institutions have been destroyed, including 90 in 2023, 30 in 2024, and 20 in 2025. Journalists have been targeted in homes, resulting in the deaths of family members, and 255 have been injured by gunfire. Settler violence increased from 27 incidents in 2023 to 36 in 2024 and 28 in early 2025. Digital threats include coordinated platform censorship by Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, X, and TikTok, often with Israeli government collaboration, involving account bans, content removal, and harassment. Over 500 journalists have been forced to flee their homes, with approximately 50 killed in shelters, schools, or tents near hospitals. The syndicate emphasized that attacks have evolved from harassment and detention to direct targeting of lives and property. It called for protective gear, emergency medical units, safe zones, psychological support, digital security training, and international legal action through the UN, the International Criminal Court, and the International Federation of Journalists. It also urged financial and technical support for independent media, emergency equipment storage, and training in conflict safety and risk management.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 09:04 PM\nSource:[Addustour newspaper (\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631)](https://www.addustour.com/articles/1522000)\n\n**War tears at heart of Congo**\nIn eastern Congo, ongoing conflict involving over 100 armed groups, including the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, has intensified since January 2025, leading to a surge in casualties and deepening one of the world's largest humanitarian crises.

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that Israel has killed an average of more than one child per hour since the conflict began, equivalent to a full classroom of children per day. A Johns Hopkins University study published in The Lancet in December 2024 confirmed the Gaza authorities' figures as accurate, while a May 2024 Economist report concluded the numbers represent the 'lower bound' of casualties, with real figures possibly 40% higher. As of January 2025, a Lancet study estimated actual fatalities could be 40% above official reports. An Israeli military commander in August 2024 stated over 20% of Gaza\u2019s 2.2 million population\u2014more than 200,000 people\u2014were killed or injured in Israeli attacks. Over 1 million people have been internally displaced, with 1.168 million displaced as of April 2025, representing about 53% of Gaza\u2019s population. Israeli forces have destroyed 90% of Gaza\u2019s territory, and currently control 82% of the enclave. The blockade has caused a severe humanitarian crisis, with UNRWA reporting at least 1,000 deaths due to famine. More than 1,200 entire families have been wiped out in Israeli attacks. At least 543 humanitarian workers, including 370 UNRWA staff, have been killed in Israeli strikes. Over 210 Palestinian journalists have been killed, according to Reporters Without Borders, as Israel has blocked foreign journalists and independent investigators from entering Gaza. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, at least 994 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023, including 212 children, with 965 killed by Israeli soldiers and 19 by extremist settlers. Between January and September 2025, 1,384 homes and structures were demolished in the West Bank, adding to 1,768 demolitions in 2024. Peace Now and B'Tselem, two Israeli NGOs, reported that 41 Palestinian communities were expelled by settler violence supported by the Israeli military. In July 2025, they jointly accused Israel of committing genocide. The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) endorsed this view, with 86% of its 500 members supporting the conclusion. A UN-mandated independent commission concluded that Israel, particularly leaders including Benjamin Netanyahu, is committing four out of five acts of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The commission\u2019s chair, Navi Pillay, stated there is clear intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza. The report, published before the UN General Assembly in September 2025, was not binding but may inform future prosecutions at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. While the UK and France recognized Palestinian self-determination at the UN, neither labeled Israel\u2019s actions as genocide.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:36 AM\nSource:[TVI](https://tvi.iol.pt/noticias/faixa-de-gaza/israel/este-e-o-numero-inexato-de-mortos-em-dois-anos-exatos-de-guerra/20251007/68e3c969d34ee0c2fed0eee7)\n\n**The Pain Persists: Two Years After Hamas\u2019s Brutal Attack on Israel, War and Suffering Continue**\nTwo years have passed since the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered a major escalation in the Middle East conflict. The surprise assault resulted in nearly 1,200 deaths in Israel and the kidnapping of over 250 hostages. As of October 7, 2025, peace remains elusive, with ongoing suffering on both sides. Survivors continue to grapple with trauma from the massacre, and the central focus remains on hostage releases and a ceasefire to enable reconstruction. Israel\u2019s military response in the Gaza Strip has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, with over 67,000 Palestinians reported dead\u2014far exceeding the number of fatalities from the initial attack\u2014sparking global concern over civilian protection. Severe shortages of water, food, and shelter persist, with families like Iman Abdel Halim surviving in displacement tents, according to reports by Reuters and CNN. International civil society has responded with humanitarian flotillas attempting to deliver aid despite major logistical and security challenges. The conflict has fueled global polarization, with widespread protests in capitals supporting Palestinians and opposing Israeli policy. The war has also proven extremely dangerous for journalists, with more media personnel killed in this conflict than in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and Afghanistan combined, highlighting the extreme peril of reporting from the region. The only visible hope for the future is a potential peace agreement that could serve as a new roadmap to end the cycle of violence and suffering.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[TV Azteca](https://www.tvazteca.com/aztecanoticias/2-anos-ataque-hamas-israel-guerra-palestina-gaza-sufrimiento-siguen)\n\n**The World Is a Genocide: A Critique of Global Inaction and the Erosion of Human Rights**\nThe article titled 'El mundo es un genocidio' argues that global violence and systemic failures have reduced the world to a state resembling genocide. It references high death tolls from drug use in the U.S. (97,231 in 2023), war casualties in Gaza (67,000 since 2023), Yemen (377,000 dead), and Ukraine (up to 1 million military and civilian deaths by 2024), while criticizing the UN for failing to act decisively. The author claims that the term 'genocide' is misused and diluted, pointing to historical oversights such as the UN's inaction during the Rwandan genocide (800,000 killed in 100 days) and the underreported violence in Venezuela (18,000 homicides in 2011), Nigeria (200 Christians killed in 2025), and Sri Lanka. The piece condemns the politicization of victimhood, accusing international actors of framing Israel as genocidal while ignoring Hamas\u2019s role in capturing Israeli civilians. It criticizes the UN\u2019s silence on global atrocities and accuses Western elites of using ideological polarization to justify violence. The author invokes Kofi Annan\u2019s 2005 UN report emphasizing that threats like terrorism, organized crime, and state violence are interconnected and that all people have a right to live without fear. Despite the UN\u2019s 1998 resolution linking terrorism to human rights violations, the author asserts that current international law is ineffective. The article concludes by quoting UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 warning that 'the planet is on the brink,' criticizing the UN\u2019s focus on climate and gender issues while ignoring ongoing genocidal violence. The author calls for a global moral response based on the principle of protecting human life and liberty.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:26 AM\nSource:[El Carabobe\u00f1o](https://www.el-carabobeno.com/el-mundo-es-un-genocidio/)\n\n**Two Years After the Middle East Earthquake: The Cost and Lessons of October 7**\nTwo years have passed since October 7, 2023, a pivotal moment that triggered a major escalation in the Arab-Israeli conflict, leading to an ongoing war that remains unresolved as of October 6, 2025. The attack, described by Hamas as a 'calculated gamble,' evolved into a protracted and devastating war, resulting in approximately 60,000 Palestinian deaths, hundreds of thousands of injuries, and near-total destruction of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure. While the conflict recentered the Palestinian issue on the global stage and exposed the limits of normalization with occupation, Hamas has suffered significant losses, including the erosion of its leadership and organizational capacity due to sustained Israeli bombing and blockade\u2014conditions some describe as genocide. By the end of the second year, Hamas accepted a U.S. presidential plan proposed by Donald Trump, involving disarmament, release of remaining hostages, and the establishment of an interim administration in Gaza, signaling a shift from seeking military victory to seeking a viable exit from the crisis. The war\u2019s impact extended beyond Gaza, spreading to Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, with direct Israeli strikes on Iran and a major realignment of regional power structures. The conflict has rewritten the regional map through violence and destruction. The article reflects on the broader political and humanitarian tragedy, questioning whether the immense cost was justified. It argues that political movements must be judged not by slogans or battlefield gains, but by their ability to build state institutions and serve their people. The true test of any movement is its capacity to govern and improve lives\u2014transforming Gaza from a battleground for factions into a space for citizens. For Israel, the lesson is that military force alone cannot extinguish the Palestinian national identity or end resistance, as demonstrated by the enduring symbolism of October 6. The central lesson is that lasting peace requires political vision, state-building, and a commitment to human dignity over perpetual conflict.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:17 PM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/3568269)\n\n**Global Pro-Palestinian Protests Surge Amid Escalating Gaza Conflict, UN Finds Genocide Evidence**\nAccording to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), nearly 48,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrations have taken place globally over the past two years since Israel's offensive in Gaza began on October 7, 2023. The data shows a 43% increase in protests between May and September 2025 compared to the previous five months, with 15% of all global demonstrations during this period being pro-Palestinian, occurring in 137 countries and territories. The largest concentrations of protests were in Yemen, Morocco, the United States, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, France, Italy, Spain, and Australia\u2014accounting for over 75% of the total. The vast majority of these demonstrations were peaceful, with only 1% resulting in violence. Regionally, 22,066 protests (46% of the total) occurred in the Middle East, followed by 8,298 in Europe and Central Asia (17%), 14% in Africa, 13% in the U.S. and Canada, 9% in Asia-Pacific, and 1% in Latin America and the Caribbean. ACLED attributes the surge in protests to ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza, which have led to over 67,000 Palestinian deaths according to Gaza authorities, widespread displacement, and severe humanitarian restrictions. The UN Human Rights Council\u2019s investigation concluded on September 16 that Israel committed acts of genocide in Gaza, citing at least four of the five acts defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention, including killings, severe physical and psychological harm, conditions aimed at destruction, and measures to prevent births. This conclusion was echoed by the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) on September 1. The report also notes a growing international backlash, including recognition of the State of Palestine by several Western allies of Israel\u2014such as the UK, France, Canada, and Australia\u2014drawing sharp criticism from Israel\u2019s government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the U.S. The offensive has also been marked by approximately 21,900 conflict events, second only to Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, with over 11,900 airstrikes and drone attacks. Gaza City (North) accounted for nearly 60% of Israeli military activity in September 2025, including extensive use of explosive robots\u2014over 110 since May 2024, with more than a third in Gaza City alone. ACLED reports that these robots, often repurposed armored vehicles loaded with explosives and remotely controlled, are used not only for attacks but also to intimidate civilians and force evacuations. Despite growing opposition within Israel\u2019s security apparatus, the political leadership continues to pursue a 'total victory' driven by ideological goals, aiming to degrade Hamas, block alternative Palestinian governance, and push Gaza toward uninhabitability to encourage migration and obstruct Palestinian sovereignty. Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that his government will not accept a Palestinian state, even after accepting a U.S. proposal from Donald Trump that envisions a credible path toward Palestinian self-determination and peaceful coexistence through dialogue.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:02 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-dos-anos-ofensiva-israel-contra-gaza-dejan-48000-movilizaciones-propalestinas-mundo-20251007010250.html)\n\n**Two Years of Genocide War in Gaza: Escalating Attacks on Palestinian Journalists**\nSince October 7, 2023, Palestinian journalists have faced escalating violence and systematic violations by Israeli forces and settlers, according to data from the Freedom Committee of the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate. The report documents 252 journalist fatalities in Gaza by October 2025, including 34 female journalists killed by Israeli military fire. The years 2023, 2024, and 2025 saw a sharp rise in attacks: 102 journalists killed in 2023, 91 in 2024, and 59 in early 2025. Over 1,000 journalists have been injured, with 63 in 2023, 86 in 2024, and 54 in 2025, including severe injuries such as amputations. Since the start of the conflict, 153 journalists have been arrested\u201448 in 2023, 69 in 2024, and 36 in early 2025. More than 150 media offices and institutions have been destroyed, including 90 in 2023, 30 in 2024, and 20 in 2025. Journalists have been targeted in homes, resulting in the deaths of family members, and 255 have been injured by gunfire. Settler violence increased from 27 incidents in 2023 to 36 in 2024 and 28 in early 2025. Digital threats include coordinated platform censorship by Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, X, and TikTok, often with Israeli government collaboration, involving account bans, content removal, and harassment. Over 500 journalists have been forced to flee their homes, with approximately 50 killed in shelters, schools, or tents near hospitals. The syndicate emphasized that attacks have evolved from harassment and detention to direct targeting of lives and property. It called for protective gear, emergency medical units, safe zones, psychological support, digital security training, and international legal action through the UN, the International Criminal Court, and the International Federation of Journalists. It also urged financial and technical support for independent media, emergency equipment storage, and training in conflict safety and risk management.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 09:04 PM\nSource:[Addustour newspaper (\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631)](https://www.addustour.com/articles/1522000)\n\n**CrisisWatch September 2025**\nCrisisWatch, a global conflict tracker by ReliefWeb, released its September 2025 report, highlighting seven conflict risks and one resolution opportunity for October 2025. In Gaza, Israel killed over 2,500 Palestinians in September, with a U.S.-proposed ceasefire plan offering fragile hope. In Yemen, the Houthis intensified maritime attacks, targeting U.S. oil interests and risking renewed conflict with Washington. In Sudan, the battle for El Fasher in North Darfur intensified, threatening to derail a U.S.-led peace initiative. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, former President Joseph Kabila was sentenced to death in absentia for allegedly supporting Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, potentially undermining regional diplomacy. In Cameroon, Anglophone separatists enforced a lockdown ahead of the 12 October presidential election, raising fears of violence. In Venezuela, a U.S. attack on alleged drug vessels near territorial waters killed 17, escalating tensions and raising the risk of further U.S. strikes. In Georgia, anti-government protests in Tbilisi resurged ahead of 4 October municipal elections, increasing the risk of clashes. CrisisWatch also recorded twelve deteriorations in September: failed Iran-E3 talks stalled a diplomatic breakthrough on nuclear sanctions; South Sudan charged First Vice President Riek Machar, escalating political tensions; the Islamic State launched its first 2025 assault on Moc\u00edmboa da Praia in Mozambique, expanding its reach; youth-led protests in Madagascar over power and water cuts turned deadly, killing at least 22 and leading to the dismissal of Prime Minister Christian Ntsay; in Nepal, youth-led protests ousted Prime Minister K.P.

M23\u2019s military coordinator, Sultani Makenga, accused President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi of destroying the country and called for the overthrow of his regime, promising a 'rapid liberation' of the nation. At Rumangabo, coordinator Bertrand Bisimwa declared the 'revolution' had reached its decisive phase, framing the movement\u2019s armed struggle as a quest for accountable governance. On September 19, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres released a report detailing severe abuses by the M23 and allies, including the arbitrary arrest of at least 1,454 people, forced recruitment into training camps, destruction of civilian property, and the massacre of 335 civilians between July 9 and 28. On October 4, President Tshisekedi addressed youth in M23-occupied territories, praising their courage and promising liberation and post-conflict reconstruction. The Washington follow-up committee met on October 1, confirming the resumption of peace talks in Doha starting October 6, with an agreement reached on a prisoner exchange mechanism involving the ICRC, and goals to neutralize the FDLR and withdraw Rwandan forces. However, a regional economic agreement (CIER) between the DRC and Rwanda, mediated by the U.S., was rejected by Kinshasa, which cited fear of public backlash. On October 2, FARDC drones bombed M23 positions in Buleusa, triggering civilian displacement. On September 30, MONUSCO\u2019s Bintou Keita warned the UN Security Council of a 'disconnect between decisions and on-the-ground realities,' noting that the M23 had trained over 7,000 recruits in recent months and that Resolution 2773\u2019s call for M23 withdrawal from Goma and Bukavu remained unimplemented eight months later, urging for a permanent and effective ceasefire.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 11:26 AM\nSource:[Actualite.cd](https://actualite.cd/2025/10/05/est-de-la-rdc-les-points-saillants-du-processus-de-paix-cette-semaine)\n\n**Global Conflicts Reach Historic High in 2024, According to Uppsala University Study**\nAccording to the Conflict Data Program at Uppsala University, there were 61 conflicts involving states in 2024, the highest number since 1946. This represents a significant increase from previous years, with 11 conflicts reaching the level of war. Analysts define 'war' as a conflict resulting in at least 1,000 deaths per year. The number of wars in 2024 is the highest since 2016. Despite the increase in conflicts and wars, the total number of deaths in 2024 decreased slightly. Estimates suggest that around 160,000 people died as a result of conflicts in 2024. 'We see more wars and conflicts than before, but fewer people are dying than in the extremely violent year of 2022. 2024 was the fourth most violent year since the Rwandan genocide in 1994,' says co-author Sean Davis. The war in Ukraine remains the deadliest conflict in the world, with an estimated 76,000 deaths in 2024. 'It's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between civilians and members of armed groups, although the information situation has improved in many areas over the past 15 years. This is particularly challenging in situations where the distinction between civilians and combatants is blurred,' says co-author Theresa Pettersson. In 2024, there was a significant increase in cases of violence directed against civilians. The program recorded 13,900 cases of civilian deaths as a result of targeted attacks, a 31% increase from the previous year. The Islamic State (IS) terrorist group remains the deadliest, responsible for the deaths of around 3,800 civilians, mostly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since 2010, the number of conflicts involving states has nearly doubled, and the total number of deaths has increased fivefold. The 2024 statistics will be published in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Peace Research.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[newsru.co.il](https://www.newsru.co.il/science_hitech/16jun2025/conflict_vg.html)\n\n**UCDP: 61 Armed Conflicts in 2024, Record High Since 1946**\nAccording to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), there were 61 armed conflicts involving states in 2024, a record high since 1946.

In some conflicts, such as the Gaza Strip, civilians make up to 98% of the dead. 'We are seeing a rapid increase in interstate conflicts and situations where governments support armed groups outside their own country,' said UCDP's senior analyst, Sean Davis. He notes that this is a 'disturbing trend' that contributes to the growing number of victims among the civilian population. 'It is a war that has caused immense destruction, displacement, torture, and massive losses among the civilian population,' said Sean Davis. 'It is a war that has been well-documented in the 21st century.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 07:50 AM\nSource:[unian](https://www.unian.ua/world/u-2024-roci-rozgorilasya-rekordna-kilkist-konfliktiv-z-chasiv-drugoji-svitovoji-the-times-13034844.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters across military analysis, crisis early warning, international relations, security studies, and political science converge on several key points in evaluating whether a new war or a substantial escalation of a previous war will result in at least 5,000 deaths in 2025, under the strict Metaculus criteria (requiring the conflict to have had fewer than 1,000 deaths in both 2023 and 2024).\n\nAll experts emphasize that the historical base rate for a qualifying new or escalated conflict crossing the 5,000-death threshold is low, typically zero or one per year even during periods of global instability. The bulk of violent deaths in 2025 are concentrated in ongoing wars (Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan) that are ineligible due to previous high fatality counts.\n\nRecent trends (2024-2025) show record numbers of active conflicts and elevated global risk, which marginally increases the probability over historic norms. However, most forecasters note that eligible conflicts must be either genuinely new or escalating from a previously low-casualty state. This sharply narrows plausible candidates.\n\nThe analysts highlight the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), specifically the M23/Rwanda conflict in eastern Congo, as the leading candidate for a potentially qualifying escalation, citing credible indicators: mass displacement, a surge in civilian amputations, and reports of intensified violence in 2025. Nonetheless, forecasters repeatedly caution that (a) there is ambiguity whether DRC's deaths in 2023 and 2024 stayed below 1,000 (a requirement), and (b) credible sources have not yet confirmed 5,000+ deaths in 2025, with much reporting emphasizing displacement and injury rather than confirmed fatalities. The DRC's chronic violence and poor data environments are seen as barriers to clear attribution and verification.\n\nOther potential flashpoints (Cameroon, Venezuela, Mozambique, Sudan, Georgia) are discussed, but none show clear evidence or current risk trajectories that would credibly result in a sudden jump to 5,000 deaths before year-end, given the time remaining.\n\nUnanimously, the experts agree that while the probability of a qualifying escalation is modestly higher than in a typical year due to overall instability and several warning signs, it remains well below 50%. Most forecasts cluster between 12% and 42%, with most in the 18%-40% range. Elevated uncertainty is noted due to reporting lags and possible late-year surprises, but the consensus is that the strict fine print and the weight of historical precedent point toward a 'No' resolution as the likeliest outcome, absent clear, late-breaking evidence of mass-fatality escalation in an eligible conflict.",
