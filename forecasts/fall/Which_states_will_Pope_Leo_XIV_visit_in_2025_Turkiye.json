The event is also central to Catholic-Orthodox dialogue, with the 1700th anniversary providing compelling justification for the trip and giving the Turkish government\u2014despite regional instability\u2014reasons to facilitate. While there remain modest risks from security or sudden regional crises, there is no indication of deterioration sufficient to derail the present plans. The only serious downside risk is if a rapid flare-up in the region (e.g., Israel/Lebanon/Turkiye) creates a no-go zone or if the Vatican determines an unacceptable risk late in the planning.

Acutis, born in 1991 in London and raised in Milan, died in 2006 at age 15 from acute leukemia. He is known as the \u2018ciberap\u00f3stol\u2019 or \u2018geek de Dios\u2019 for using computers to spread the word of God, documenting more than 130 Eucharistic miracles and creating evangelisation websites. His beatification in 2020 and the recognition of two miracles \u2013 the cure of a Brazilian child with pancreatic disease and the recovery of a Costa Rican student from a coma \u2013 led to his canonisation. He is interred in a glass reliquary at Santa Maria la Mayor in Assisi, where thousands of pilgrims visit annually. Frassati, who died 4 July 1925 at age 24, was a Dominican layman active in charity, the Catholic Action and the St. Vincent de Paul Society. He was beatified 20 May 1990 by Pope John Paul II and is called the \u2018hombre de las Bienaventuranzas\u2019, patron of youth, students, athletes and Catholic youth groups. In 2024 Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to Frassati, opening the path to canonisation. The ceremony was originally scheduled for 3 August 2025 to coincide with the Youth Jubilee but was postponed after Pope Francis\u2019s death in April 2025. The article cites the dates 1991, 2006, 2018, 2020, 2024, 2025, 4 July 1925, and 20 May 1990, and the figure 130 miracles. Quotes from the text include \u2018ciberap\u00f3stol\u2019, \u2018geek de Dios\u2019, \u2018hombre de las Bienaventuranzas\u2019, and \u2018santo millennial\u2019.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 04:52 PM\nSource:[Mi Diario](https://www.midiario.com/mundo/leon-xiv-eleva-a-los-altares-a-carlo-acutis-y-pier-giorgio-frassati/)\n\n**Vatican Hosts First LGBTQ+ Pilgrimage Under Pope Leo XIV**\nA thousand LGBT Catholics marched from the Jesuit church of Jes\u00fas to the Vatican, covering 130 km, marking the first gay pilgrimage in the official Jubilee calendar, which occurs every 25 years. The pilgrimage passed through the Santa Gate of St. Peter's Basilica during the 2025 Holy Year. The mass was presided over by the vice\u2011president of the Italian Episcopal Conference. The pilgrims noted that the Catholic Catechism still labels homosexual acts as 'intr\u00ednsecamente desordenados', yet they see the path as long. Pope Francis had previously advocated an inclusive church, calling for 'todos, todos, todos' and opening blessings for same\u2011sex couples in late 2023, provoking backlash in conservative regions such as Africa. Pope Leo XIV, the new pontiff, has not yet spoken on the issue but reportedly aligns with Francis\u2019s stance. When he was a cardinal, he echoed Francis\u2019s call for a more inclusive church, saying 'dej\u00f3 muy claro que no quiere que las personas sean excluidas simplemente por las decisiones que toman, ya sea de estilo de vida, trabajo o lo que sea'. On Thursday, Leo XIV met with a group of homosexuals from the United States, informing them of his intention to continue Francis\u2019s 'pol\u00edtica de aceptaci\u00f3n LGBT' in the Church. Pope Bergoglio also met with gay activists and a trans\u2011women community, though he did not change the Church\u2019s teachings on homosexual acts.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Filo News](https://www.filo.news/noticia/2025/09/06/el-vaticano-recibio-la-primera-peregrinacion-de-la-comunidad-lgbtq-en-el-papado-de-leon-xiv)\n\n**Vatican Hosts First Official LGBT+ Pilgrimage During Jubilee**\nThe article reports that the Vatican hosted its first official LGBT+ pilgrimage during the 2025 Jubilee year. A route called the V\u00eda Franc\u00edgena starts in England, passes through France and Switzerland, and ends at St. Peter\u2019s Square, covering about 130 km. More than 1,400 Catholic LGBT+ individuals and their families from roughly twenty countries participated, according to the Italian association La Tenda di Gionata. The pilgrimage did not include a private audience with Pope Leo\u202fXIV. \n\nKey participants highlighted include Yveline Behets, a 68\u2011year\u2011old trans woman who walked the full distance from Brussels, and Hugo, a 35\u2011year\u2011old Franco\u2011Quebecer who said, 'Es una se\u00f1al realmente importante para nosotros el sentirnos m\u00e1s incluidos' in a statement to AFP. Beatrice Sarti, a 60\u2011year\u2011old Italian who came with her gay son, remarked, 'Nuestros hijos ya no van a la iglesia porque se les hizo sentir que estaban equivocados. Eso debe cambiar'. The article notes that Pope Francis, who served from 2013 until his death in April 2024, had opened the possibility of blessings for same\u2011sex couples in late 2023, sparking opposition in conservative circles, especially in Africa. The piece concludes that the pilgrimage signals a growing push for greater inclusion within the Catholic Church, though doctrinal changes remain slow.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[TVN](https://www.tvn-2.com/mundo/vaticano-recibe-primer-gran-peregrinaje-jubileo_1_2205072.html)\n\n**LGBTQ+ Catholics make Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, acknowledging new sense of acceptance**\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families joined a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, celebrating what they see as a new level of acceptance within the Catholic Church.

Fr. Charlie Gallagher, pastor of Immaculate Conception Church in Washington, D.C., travelled to Rome for the ceremony. He described the atmosphere as 'The atmosphere here is already one of expectant joy, even electric,' and said he expects a crowd of at least 250,000 worshipers on Sunday. The Vatican anticipates that over 32 million pilgrims will travel during the Jubilee year, according to the U.S. Embassy in Italy. Gallagher, who has known Frassati\u2019s niece Wanda for 20 years, said he took Frassati as his patron and that Pope John Paul\u202fII called him the 'Man of the Beatitudes.' He also noted that Acutis, though academically challenged, devoted himself to spreading devotion to the Eucharist. Pope Francis had previously championed Acutis\u2019s cause, and Leo XIV has highlighted technology, especially artificial intelligence, as a major challenge. The article also mentions Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, who reports on the cathedral\u2019s restoration five years after the 2019 fire. Gallagher lived in Rome for four years while a seminarian at the North American College in 2007, and he recalls that Pier Giorgio died in 1925 and his sister Luciana gave birth to Wanda in 1926.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 11:51 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/pope-leo-xiv-canonize-two-modern-saints-weekend-faithful-flock-rome)\n\n**LGBTQ+ Catholics make Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, acknowledging new sense of acceptance**\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families joined a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, celebrating what they see as a new level of acceptance within the Catholic Church.

They discussed the 'tragic situation in Gaza', the need to guarantee a future for the Palestinian people, and the urgent need for a permanent ceasefire. The Holy See said it had 'expected a prompt resumption of negotiations' and that 'all hostages should be liberated'. Herzog thanked the Pope for the 'warm reception' but avoided speaking directly about Gaza, instead urging religious leaders to 'raise their voices to demand the release of hostages'. After the audience, Herzog met with Vatican officials Pietro Parolin and Paul R. Gallagher, where they talked about the political and social situation in the Middle East, the Palestinian future, and the two\u2011state solution. The Israeli president also highlighted freedom of worship and Israel's pride in its Christian community. The Vatican confirmed that it also discussed relations between state authorities and the local church. Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares said Europe must do more to address the violence in Palestine and proposed measures such as an arms embargo on Israel. Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Abulgheit condemned the US decision to revoke Palestinian diplomats' visas for the UN General Assembly. Several countries, including France, the UK, Australia and Canada, announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 01:55 AM\nSource:[Peri\u00f3dico El D\u00eda](https://eldia.com.do/el-papa-y-presidente-israeli-se-reunen-tratan-drama-de-gaza)\n\n**Pope\u2019s Prayer to Israeli President: 'Courage Needed: Ceasefire Now'**\nOn 4 September 2025, Pope Leo XIV met Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the Holy See.

Herzog, in a social\u2011media post, noted that it has been 700 days since the kidnapping of 48 of his compatriots still in Gaza, calling for the immediate release of hostages and expressing concern over rising antisemitism. He thanked the Pope for his warm reception and reaffirmed Israel\u2019s commitment to safeguard Christian communities in the Holy Land. The Vatican\u2019s final communiqu\u00e9 reiterated the two\u2011state solution, urged the international community to support a permanent ceasefire, safe humanitarian aid, and respect for humanitarian law, and called for the release of all hostages.

According to the Vatican Press Office, the meeting focused on the 'tr\u00e1gica situa\u00e7\u00e3o em Gaza' and the need for negotiations that lead to a lasting solution. The Pope urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, safe entry of humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages still held by Hamas. He reiterated that 'Uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de dois Estados \u00e9 a \u00fanica sa\u00edda para a guerra', highlighting the importance of a two\u2011state solution and also drawing attention to events in the West Bank and the status of Jerusalem. After the meeting, Herzog met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, and Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary for Relations with States and International Organizations, where the importance of Christian communities in the Middle East for social cohesion, education and regional stability was emphasized. The Vatican\u2019s appeal comes amid growing international pressure on Israel and on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been criticized by world leaders for Gaza offensives and restrictions on supplies entering the enclave. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would officially recognize a Palestinian state, joining 147 UN member states. Canada is expected to announce support for a Palestinian state at the next UN General Assembly, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has already expressed a favourable position for the two\u2011state solution.

He stressed that a two\u2011state solution is the sole path to ending the war and restoring regional stability. According to a Vatican press release, the conflict that began on 7\u202fOctober\u202f2023 has already claimed more than 64,000 Palestinian deaths and 161,000 injuries, largely among children and women, and has left thousands missing, displaced, and starving. The Pope and his delegation, including Cardinal Pietro\u202fBarolini, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary of State, called for respect of humanitarian law, safe delivery of aid, and the release of all hostages, asserting that the legitimate aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis can only be met through a two\u2011state solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\u202fNetanyahu faces mounting domestic and international pressure to halt the war, amid accusations of delaying peace for political survival. President Hertzog, on X, said he discussed with the Pope ways to strengthen peace and that Israel is doing everything possible to free hostages held by Hamas, urging religious leaders to support immediate release as a step toward a better future for the region. The visit comes amid rising tensions between the Vatican and Israel, following Pope Francis\u2019s criticism of the Gaza war and the Israeli strike on a Catholic church in July. Vatican observers see the Pope\u2019s recent stance as additional diplomatic and moral pressure on Israel, potentially revitalizing the Catholic Church\u2019s role as a spiritual mediator in the Israeli\u2011Palestinian conflict.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 05:14 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6687313)\n\n**Pope Leo XIV discusses Gaza, 2-state solution with Israeli president**\nOn September 4, 2025, Pope Leo XIV met privately with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the Vatican. According to a Vatican statement, the talks focused on the political and social situation in the Middle East and the need to guarantee 'a future for the Palestinian people and peace and stability in the region', with the Holy See reiterating the two\u2011state solution as the only way out of the ongoing war. Herzog also met Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Vatican Secretary for Relations with States Archbishop Paul Gallagher. In a post on X, Herzog thanked Leo for a 'warm welcome today at the Vatican' and said he looked forward to strengthening Israel's cooperation with the Holy See 'for a better future of justice and compassion.' The Vatican communique, longer than usual, called for a resumption of negotiations, a permanent ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages, respect for humanitarian law, and safe entry of aid into Gaza, and expressed hope that the 'legitimate aspirations' of both Israeli and Palestinian peoples could be guaranteed. It also referenced the situation in the West Bank, the city of Jerusalem, and relations between Israeli authorities and the local Church. The Vatican reiterated its call for an international status for Jerusalem, where Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa serves as Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and of the Palestinian territories. During a July visit to Taybeh, Pizzaballa and other Church leaders accused Israeli authorities of 'facilitating and enabling' attacks on Palestinian Christians by settlers. The meeting also touched on ensuring the continued presence of Christian communities throughout the Middle East. Herzog\u2019s statement after the talks highlighted the great significance of the relationship between the Holy See, the State of Israel, and the Jewish people, and the importance of sensitive issues and challenges. A tension arose when Herzog\u2019s office had earlier stated that the visit was at the Pope\u2019s invitation, but the Vatican clarified that it only agrees to requests for audiences from heads of state. The article notes that Vatican\u2011Israel relations had been strained during Pope Francis\u2019s pontificate, when he criticized Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza and called it 'terrorism' and possibly 'genocide'. Pope Leo has taken a more restrained approach, calling for ceasefires, the release of hostages, dignified humanitarian aid, and respect for law.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 04:14 PM\nSource:[Catholic World Report](https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2025/09/04/pope-leo-xiv-discusses-gaza-2-state-solution-with-israeli-president/)\n\n**Vatican, seminar on 'Creation, nature, environment for a world of peace' - Vatican News**\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Holy See, will open the international seminar \"Creation, nature, environment for a world of peace\" on 11 September at 15:00 in Casina Pio IV, Vatican City.

On 26 August, the Latin and Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Jerusalem issued a joint statement affirming their intent to continue caring for all people in the church. On 2 September, the Armenian Catholicos Karekin II, on the Republic of Artsakh\u2019s Independence Day, delivered a message of remembrance and hope, recalling the 2020 and 2023 tragedies involving war, forced displacement of Armenians, and the captivity of officials and soldiers in Baku. He honored martyrs, called for the release of captives and peace, and urged protection of displaced peoples\u2019 rights, preservation of Armenian spiritual heritage, and unity. In August, 45 Middle\u2011Eastern nuns stayed in France for a few weeks. Since the summer of 2023, French churches in Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Palestine have opened their doors free of charge to these nuns, who face heavy workloads and harsh conditions in their home countries. The growing number of visits confirms the success of this initiative, and the nuns appreciate the warm welcome, bringing joy and renewal to French communities.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 02:46 PM\nSource:[vaticannews.va](https://www.vaticannews.va/hi/church/news/2025-09/news-from-the-oriental-churches-sept-3-2025.html)\n\n**Pope Leo XIV: Audience with the President of the State of Israel \u2013 Vatican News**\nThe Holy See\u2019s Press Office issued a statement on 4 September 2025 announcing that Pope Leo XIV met with the President of the State of Israel, His Excellency Isaac Herzog, in the Apostolic Palace.

The Pope expressed hope for a swift return to negotiations, the release of all hostages, the cessation of hostilities, the reliable delivery of humanitarian aid to the most affected areas, and the full observance of humanitarian law and the legitimate expectations of both peoples. He reiterated the Holy See\u2019s support for a two\u2011state solution as the sole way out of the ongoing war, and mentioned the situation on the West Bank and the city of Jerusalem.

The preparations for the visit are underway, although the official date has not been set yet. The Vatican has expressed a genuine interest in completing this visit to Lebanon, which is home to over 2 million Catholics, according to Vatican statistics. A Lebanese official, speaking to Reuters, stated that 'the consultations are ongoing regarding the visit, with the date to be set in the coming weeks.' The Vatican spokesperson declined to comment directly on Cardinal Rai's statements. The visit may be part of a broader tour that includes Turkey, where the Pope is expected to participate in the celebration of the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea in the city of \u0130znik. Pope Leo had expressed his desire to participate in this event in July, saying, 'I hope to be able to meet you again in a few months to participate in the ecumenical celebration of the Council of Nicaea.' In a message to participants in a youth religious conference in Ankara, according to the Monitor newspaper. The Pope has expressed his deep solidarity with the Lebanese people in the fifth anniversary of the Beirut port explosion, saying, 'Lebanon, the beloved and suffering, remains in our prayers.' He added, 'The tears of Christ join our tears,' in a spiritual expression of his personal empathy with the suffering of the Lebanese people. The potential visit comes after a meeting between the Pope and Lebanese President Joseph Aoun on June 13th in the Vatican. According to church sources, the meeting was 'warm and symbolic,' and during which the commitment of the Holy See to support Lebanon's political and economic stability, and to maintain its religious diversity, which is a cornerstone of Lebanese identity, was reaffirmed. The two sides also discussed the file of reforms and ways to restore the confidence of the international community, as well as the central role of the Maronite Church in social cohesion. This meeting is seen as a preparatory step on the diplomatic level for a formal visit, which could be a turning point in the relations between the Vatican and Lebanon in the post-crisis period. Pope Leo, the first American to hold the papacy, tends to complete the spiritual and political line of his predecessor Francis, but adds a charismatic dimension to it. He has appeared in several occasions surrounded by young crowds, as happened during the 'Youth Jubilee' celebration in Rome, attended by hundreds of thousands from 146 countries. These popular events have shown that the new Pope does not limit himself to the symbolism of the papacy, but seeks to strengthen the global presence of the Church, particularly in areas experiencing crises, such as Lebanon and Turkey, which explains the deep dimensions of his upcoming tour.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 12:43 PM\nSource:[@Elaph](https://elaph.com/Web/News/2025/08/1575261.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasters converge on a very high probability that Pope Leo XIV will make a state visit to T\u00fcrkiye before January 1, 2026, with most assigning probabilities between 85% and 97%. Experts emphasize the exceptional significance of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, a landmark event in global Christianity, as the central reason for the visit. Multiple sources\u2014including Catholic and Orthodox authorities, Turkish officials, and international media\u2014report that advanced planning and strong mutual signaling are underway, despite the absence of a final official Vatican press release as of early September 2025.\n\nThe visit is seen as strongly favored for several reasons: (1) historical and ecumenical importance (key for Catholic-Orthodox and interfaith dialogue), (2) explicit continuity from Pope Francis's planned trip, (3) Turkey\u2019s pragmatic willingness to host such events for international prestige, (4) positive diplomatic and security precedents, and (5) the robust health and energetic start of Pope Leo XIV\u2019s pontificate. Risks that could prompt postponement or cancellation\u2014such as a sudden and severe deterioration in regional security, a papal health crisis, or an acute diplomatic dispute\u2014are considered real but currently low-probability. \n\nCollectively, the experts judge that, barring a last-minute crisis, Turkey is highly likely to be visited by the Pope in late November 2025 for the Nicaea anniversary, fulfilling the resolution criteria for an official state visit. The forecast is supported by base rates of papal travel for major events, current positive signals from all parties, and the lack of any red-flag opposition or logistical impediments from Turkish or Vatican authorities."
