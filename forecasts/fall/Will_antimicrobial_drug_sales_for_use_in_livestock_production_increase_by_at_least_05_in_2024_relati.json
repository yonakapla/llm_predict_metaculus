Market analysis of anti-infective and veterinary drug segments shows growth, but this is spread across non-antibiotic, non-livestock, and non-medically important segments, and doesn't specifically argue for US livestock antimicrobial sales growth. Regulatory and social incentives against increasing antimicrobial use remain strong, and global AMR momentum, combined with diagnostic innovation, continue to decouple disease risk from routine drug usage.

No evidence suggests a reversal of US stewardship in 2024. The base rate for a year-over-year >0.5% increase, following several post-2017 years of flat or declining use, is low. Given slight upward risk from outbreaks, but dominant downward and stabilizing forces, the probability remains low\u2014but not vanishingly so\u2014hence 16%.",

You note that outbreak responses are increasingly managed by vaccination, culling, and non-antibiotic biosecurity, with even recent severe events in prior years producing stable or decreasing antimicrobial sales. Market growth in anti-infective and veterinary pharma is largely driven by segments not relevant for this specific metric\u2014companion animals, antiparasitics, and non-medically important molecules\u2014diluting their signaling power. Your calibration seems to underweight both the statistical rarity of upward inflection (no >0.5% increases post-2016, even amid moderate shocks) and the institutional inertia toward reduction. Given the low volatility in the FDA\u2019s data series and the structural obstacles to volume spikes, a probability much above the modal initial estimate risks overfitting narrative risk scenarios instead of proportionally weighting historic base rates, which remain the strongest signal."

The forecaster\u2019s argument gives appropriate emphasis to historical trajectory, regulatory architecture, and industry self-regulation, all of which act as high-friction barriers against even small upticks in medically important antimicrobial sales in the US. Their point that only an extreme, multi-sectoral shock or data artifact would cause a reversal at this threshold is well-grounded, given the flat-to-declining pattern and the systematic absence of year-over-year spikes in the FDA data.

Their nuanced treatment of the difference between overall veterinary drug/pharma sector growth and the much narrower FDA metric for this question is key\u2014demonstrating that rising sector value is being driven by innovation and prevention, not by increased antibiotic quantities. The explicit acknowledgment of rare, plausible stochastic or outbreak-related exceptions is appropriate given the low (but nonzero) historical frequency.

The argument that the persistence of the downward trend plus strong stewardship and scrutiny should dominate forecasting is well-supported by both US and global trends, as highlighted in both regulatory data and AMR policy analysis. Importantly, the forecaster does not ignore 'tail risks' from outbreaks or reporting artifacts, which is prudent when considering a narrow threshold (0.5%)\u2014but keeps their influence proportionate.

The nuanced treatment of up-pressure from major livestock disease events\u2014such as the documented increase in avian influenza cases\u2014demonstrates proper risk accounting, but the forecaster rightly notes that these effects are generally constrained by first-line stewardship responses (biosecurity, vaccination, culling) within the US context. The distinction between global market growth and US-specific FDA metrics is clearly recognized, so global pharma expansion is not mistakenly mapped onto the relevant sales data. By emphasizing how only a substantial, hard-to-contain disease event could credibly nudge 2024 sales across the 0.5% threshold, the forecast avoids both complacency and overstatement. The final probability of 16% is justified: it aligns with base rates and rigorously incorporates, but does not exaggerate, plausible tail risks."

The response acknowledges real but marginal risk from outbreaks and uncertainties, but correctly notes that veterinary pharmaceutical market growth is driven disproportionately by pet/biologic/alternative expansions, not increased US food-animal antimicrobial use.

Their skepticism of global growth translating into US-specific FDA metric gains is warranted, and their acknowledgement that most producers now deploy non-antibiotic strategies for acute events supports a restrained, evidence-based forecast.

The forecaster\u2019s reasoning on why sectoral pharmaceutical growth (often misinterpreted by non-specialists as evidence for higher antibiotic use) actually arises largely from non-antibiotic product categories is correct and critical here. Furthermore, the discussion of the \"tail risk\" posed by acute disease outbreaks (like avian influenza) is appropriately bounded by US-specific structural barriers\u2014namely, stewardship protocols and a strong regulatory framework. By quantitatively and qualitatively situating the probability within these constraints, the forecast avoids both dismissiveness and alarmism, providing a robust framework for integrating both status-quo inertia and the possibility of rare but impactful shocks."

Despite signals of increased animal disease burden in 2024, there is little to suggest a sustained policy relaxation or a fundamental market reversal in the US. The FDA sales trend since 2017 shows considerable inertia, with no recorded annual increases of this magnitude and ongoing downward pressure from regulation and stewardship. Most forecasters, including those with differing domain expertise (policy, epidemiology, agricultural economics), converge on the ~16% range, and strong arguments have been presented for why even substantial supply- or disease-side shocks are likely to be managed primarily by non-antibiotic means. The statistical possibility of a random uptick above the 0.5% threshold persists, but is best characterized as a rare, low-probability outcome given base rates and structural controls.

Adjacent market growth (e.g., anti-infectives, livestock pharmaceuticals) has been shown to be largely irrelevant for this specific metric, as growth is concentrated outside medically important antibiotics in food animals. The strong consensus around the base rate, lack of concrete evidence for a system shock, and repeated reference to historical data series stability argues for re-aligning with the modal estimate.

The report cites a 2025\u20112032 CAGR of 6.7% and a 2025 market size of US$ 4,830.7\u202fmillion, with a 2032 projection of US$ 7,620.1\u202fmillion.  It attributes the expansion to rising hospital\u2011acquired infections (HAIs), the prevalence of multidrug\u2011resistant organisms such as MRSA and CRE, and advances in molecular diagnostics, including PCR, next\u2011generation sequencing (NGS) and AI\u2011powered tools.  The release notes that the World Health Organization estimates that AMR could cause 10\u202fmillion deaths annually by 2050 if left unchecked, underscoring the urgency of diagnostic innovation.  Key drivers highlighted include the adoption of rapid, point\u2011of\u2011care (PoC) testing and the integration of AI and bioinformatics to accelerate detection.  Restraints identified are the limited availability of new antibiotics and the continued reliance on empirical therapy, which can dampen the uptake of diagnostic tools.  Opportunities focus on AI integration, PoC deployment in resource\u2011limited settings, and antimicrobial stewardship programs.  Regionally, North America is positioned as the market leader due to advanced infrastructure and regulatory support, while Europe, Asia\u2011Pacific, and the Middle East are projected to experience significant growth driven by regulatory mandates and rising infection burdens.  The report lists major players such as Abbott Laboratories, Bio\u2011Rad Laboratories, Thermo Fisher Scientific, BD, Roche, and bioM\u00e9rieux, and cites recent developments like bioM\u00e9rieux\u2019s FDA clearance of the VITEK\u00ae COMPACT PRO system in March\u202f2025.  Overall, the release frames the AMR diagnostics market as a high\u2011growth sector driven by technological progress and a global health imperative.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[openPR.com - Open Public Relations Free of Charge](https://www.openpr.com/news/4183698/antimicrobial-resistance-diagnostics-market-to-expand-at-6-7)\n\n**As antibiotics turn ineffective against deadly superbugs, ICMR wants curbs on their sale**\nThe ICMR\u2011funded paper recommends that new, high\u2011generation antibiotics be sold only in hospitals that have antimicrobial stewardship, infection\u2011prevention and control standards, and that they be used only for very sick patients.  Dr Kamini Walia, ICMR\u2019s AMR programme officer, told ThePrint, 'Our suggestions are for high\u2011generation antibiotic reserved for very sick patients and can be used only in hospital settings.'  The authors argue that changes can be effected through amendments to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act & Rules.  A survey of doctors in tertiary care hospitals found that most prescribe antibiotics responsibly, yet misuse, abuse and over\u2011the\u2011counter sales continue to drive AMR.  In 2019, between 3 and 10.4\u202flakh people died in India from bacterial AMR, according to the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project.  The paper notes that over the past decade, all newly introduced antimicrobials failed to show improved effectiveness against multidrug\u2011resistant gram\u2011negative pathogens, underscoring the urgent need for new treatment options such as plazomicin, cefiderocol and novel \u03b2\u2011lactam combinations.  The GRAM report also reported 6,86,908 deaths linked to six major superbugs (E.\u202fcoli, K.\u202fpneumoniae, S.\u202faureus, A.\u202fbaumannii, M.\u202ftuberculosis, S.\u202fpneumoniae), with over 2.14\u202flakh attributable deaths.  Resistance data show K.\u202fpneumoniae has 62.3\u202f% resistance to carbapenem meropenem; E.\u202fcoli\u2019s susceptibility to imipenem fell from 81\u202f% in 2017 to 63\u202f% in 2023, and to piperacillin\u2011tazobactam from 56.8\u202f% to 42.4\u202f%.  K.\u202fpneumoniae isolates had only 26.5\u202f% susceptibility to piperacillin\u2011tazobactam in 2023.  Consequently, clinicians are increasingly prescribing polymyxins such as colistin, but rising colistin use is driving resistance to this last\u2011resort drug.  Since the 2011 National Policy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance, India has introduced Schedule\u202fH1 to restrict over\u2011the\u2011counter sales, launched a red\u2011line campaign on drug packages, and periodically revised the National List of Essential Medicines, though implementation challenges limit success.  The TB programme offers a model of robust stewardship: new TB drugs (bedaquiline, delamanid, pretomanid) are dispensed only through DOTS\u2011Plus centres, with diagnostics performed by accredited labs.  Dr Aravind\u202fR., head of infectious diseases at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, said, 'I think reserve category antibiotics should only be available in hospital formularies. Also, pharmaceutical companies should be barred from offering free samples of antibiotics to physicians as they end up with patients.'  WHO\u2019s AWaRe classification divides antibiotics into access, watch and reserve groups; a 2024 government report found that 57\u202f% of reserve antibiotics prescribed in India are those with high potential for resistance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/health/as-antibiotics-turn-ineffective-against-deadly-superbugs-icmr-wants-curbs-on-their-sale/2743741/)\n\n**Anticoccidial Drugs Market: Major Trends Reshaping the Future of the Industry**\nThe press release titled 'Anticoccidial Drugs Market: Major Trends Reshaping the Future of the Industry' reports that the global anticoccidial drugs market was valued at $1.27\u202fbillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.35\u202fbillion in 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% (source: article).

The research estimates that an improved pipeline of antimicrobics targeting Gram\u2011negative bacteria could save 11\u202fmillion lives by 2050. It examined annual revenue and volume data for two representative antibiotics\u2014cefiderocol and ceftazidime\u2011avibactam\u2014using sales figures from IQVIA (2015\u20112024). Three scenarios were modelled: low, intermediate and high, with the intermediate set at roughly US$363\u202fmillion per year per drug, adjusted for inflation. The study found that the G7\u2011EU27 bloc did not meet its medium\u2011term cumulative targets. The United Kingdom achieved its medium\u2011term goals through a subscription\u2011style \u2018pay\u2011for\u2011access\u2019 programme that guarantees a fixed annual payment to manufacturers regardless of sales volume. Italy reached medium\u2011term targets by increasing drug utilisation in a high\u2011resistance epidemiological context and by establishing a national orphan\u2011antibiotic fund approved in 2025, allocating \u20ac100\u202fmillion per year.

By 2050 those figures are projected to rise to 8.22\u202fmillion (6.85\u20119.65\u202fmillion) and 1.91\u202fmillion (1.56\u20112.26\u202fmillion) respectively, with South\u202fAsia, Latin\u202fAmerica and the Caribbean expected to bear the highest mortality rates, especially among people older than 70\u202fyears. The review notes that infections caused by methicillin\u2011resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* and carbapenem\u2011resistant Gram\u2011negative bacteria will drive the greatest increase in disease burden. It also highlights the emergence of antifungal resistance, underscored by the WHO fungal priority pathogen list released in 2022. Modelling a scenario that improves patient care\u2014including optimized antimicrobial use, vaccination, sepsis detection and infection prevention and control\u2014suggests that 92\u202fmillion deaths could be prevented between 2025 and 2050. In the agricultural sector, the report warns that annual livestock production losses could match the consumption needs of 746\u202fmillion to 2\u202fbillion people, and could cause a cumulative global gross domestic product loss of US$575\u2011953\u202fbillion by 2050. The review stresses that antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) must be integrated across human, animal and environmental health, addressing data and surveillance gaps, implementation barriers, sociocultural drivers, digital innovation and the inclusion of low\u2011 and middle\u2011income countries. It calls for a One\u202fHealth approach that balances stewardship goals with patient safety, mitigates environmental contamination from pharmaceutical effluents, and reduces the carbon footprint of antimicrobials through improved hygiene, vaccination, diagnostics and outpatient management.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01233-3)\n\n**Farm Animal Drugs Market Share, CAGR, and Forecast by Region and Segment (2025-2029) In New Report**\nThe farm animal drugs market is projected to grow from $19.41\u202fbillion in 2024 to $20.66\u202fbillion in 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% (source: article).

It is here, it is growing, and it could soon become one of the biggest killers in the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has repeatedly warned that if nothing changes, resistant infections could kill more people globally than cancer by 2050. The danger is particularly acute in sub\u2011Saharan Africa, where drug regulation is weaker and antibiotics are used widely in both human health and agriculture.\n\nKenya is already facing this reality. The Ministry of Health has identified AMR as a national public health crisis, noting that common bacterial infections are becoming harder to treat with standard medicines. Doctors are increasingly reporting cases where antibiotics that used to work fail, necessitating the use of more expensive or less accessible drugs. The causes extend far beyond hospitals.\n\nOne of the major drivers of resistance is the way antibiotics are used in food\u2011producing animals. Research by the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership in Kenya has shown that about 80 per cent of livestock households regularly use antibiotics, and an astonishing 95 per cent obtain them without prescriptions.\n\nMany farmers use these drugs not just to treat illness but also to promote growth and prevent disease in healthy animals. Withdrawal periods, the mandatory time between treatment and slaughter, are often ignored, which means residues end up in meat sold to consumers. Studies show that although awareness of AMR among farmers is relatively high, with most able to correctly answer basic questions about it, this knowledge does not necessarily change behaviour.\n\nGlobally, organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) have sounded the alarm on the agricultural link to resistance. In Zimbabwe and Zambia, for instance, Farmer Field Schools supported by FAO have helped small\u2011scale poultry farmers improve hygiene and biosecurity, reducing their reliance on antibiotics.\n\nThese initiatives are part of the wider \u2018One Health\u2019 approach that recognises human, animal and environmental health as interconnected, and that tackling AMR requires coordinated action across all three.\n\nKenya has attempted to follow this path through its National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, launched in 2017 and now in its second phase. The plan committed the government to expand surveillance, strengthen regulation of drug use and improve public awareness.\n\nCounty\u2011level AMR committees have been set up to bring together the health, agriculture and environmental sectors. Yet experts warn that progress has been uneven, particularly in informal markets where much of the country\u2019s meat is sold. In these settings, regulation is weak, veterinary oversight is minimal, and consumers have little information about what they are eating.\n\nThis is where private sector practices can make a difference, even if they cannot replace public policy. Kenchic, Kenya\u2019s largest poultry processor, has adopted a farm\u2011to\u2011family traceability system that tracks meat back through breeder farms and hatcheries.\n\nThe company is the only African organisation recognised by the International Poultry Council for antimicrobial stewardship, and it holds FSSC\u202f22000 food safety certification. Products are tested regularly for microbial contamination, and customer complaints are resolved within two days.\n\n'We are highly regulated in terms of antibiotic use,' says Brenda Njeri, the company\u2019s Factory Manager. 'The measures we have in place are designed to ensure our products are antimicrobial free.' She adds that Kenchic can trace any chicken cut back to the grandparent flock it came from, giving consumers confidence about safety and origin.\n\nNjeri also emphasises the role of consumers in shaping the food system. 'Please, ask what you eat. What you eat makes you who you are. Health is key to sustainability, so whatever we offer the society must also keep it healthy.'\n\nAlun Meskel, Head of Plant Operations, is more direct about the risks elsewhere in the industry.\n\n'A good number of farmers focus so much on profitability, they pump chicken with antibiotics to prevent them from getting sick,' he says. 'By the time the chicken is slaughtered, you are buying meat that has traces of antibiotics in it. And when people fall ill, the medication they take may no longer work because they've unknowingly built resistance over time.'\n\nMeskel explains that Kenchic\u2019s long\u2011term goal is to reach antibiotic\u2011free production, a standard that only a handful of organisations worldwide are pursuing. 'Our ultimate goal is to have antibiotic\u2011free production. It is a very ambitious project, but it is the only way forward,' he says.\n\nBoth managers stress that animal welfare is closely tied to food safety. Birds are raised without cages, allowed to walk freely, and even given perches and toys to simulate a natural environment. 'When animals are stressed during transport or slaughter, the meat quality is affected. Relaxed animals produce safer and better food,' Meskel notes.\n\nHe also points out that chicken is not only affordable but one of the healthiest proteins available. 'Gram for gram, chicken has the highest protein and the least fat. It is good for you and can be eaten every day,' he says.\n\nThese insights highlight the gap between best practice and the broader market. While a company like Kenchic may offer consumers assurances, the reality is that most Kenyans still buy their meat from informal traders who lack such systems. Without stronger regulation, routine monitoring and clearer labelling, the public remains exposed to hidden risks.\n\nThe danger is not just theoretical. Resistant bacteria do not stay confined to farms, they can spread through food, water and the environment, undermining the effectiveness of antibiotics when people need them most. The Ministry of Health warns that the cost of inaction will be measured not only in money but in lives lost.\n\nIn the meantime, every plate of meat carries an unspoken question: what is really in it, and what might it mean for our health tomorrow.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 24, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[Standard Digital News - Kenya](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001527679/antibiotic-epidemic-how-meat-is-making-our-medicines-useless)\n\n**Japan Colistin Sulphate Market Strategies to Maximize Growth and Profitability, Forecast 2025 to 2032**\nThe Colistin Sulphate market is expected to grow significantly, driven by its critical role in combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, particularly in the animal health sector.

The report highlights the increasing risks to human health, with the number of outbreaks of avian influenza in mammals more than doubling in 2024, from 459 to 1,022 in 55 countries. Almost half of the animal diseases reported over the past 18 years have the potential to be transmitted to humans. Emmanuelle Soubeyran, Woah's director-general, stated, 'The spread, prevalence, and impact of animal diseases are changing rapidly, posing new and complex challenges not only for animal health, but also for agriculture, food safety, public health, and the protection of natural ecosystems.' The report also notes the resurgence of diseases considered endemic in specific regions in entirely new areas, such as the reappearance of the sheep and goat plague in Europe and the spread of the African swine fever to Sri Lanka. The report identifies climate change and the intensification of global trade as key drivers of this new geography of animal diseases. 'Prevention remains the most effective tool,' the report emphasizes, highlighting the unequal access to vaccines for livestock as a major criticism. Vaccination, along with sanitary and biosafety measures, is recommended as the key tool to prevent epidemics, reduce antibiotic use, and combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance. The report also notes a 5% decrease in the use of antibiotics in animals between 2020 and 2022, with the EU leading the trend (-23%), followed by Africa (-20%). However, one in five countries continues to use antibiotics as growth promoters, a practice strongly discouraged by Woah.

The report warns that the risk of the virus spreading to humans has increased. According to the report, there were 1,022 animal influenza outbreaks in 55 countries in 2024, up from 459 in 2023. While the risk of human infection remains low, the virus has become more adaptable to spreading between animals, increasing the likelihood of transmission to humans. The report notes that nearly half of the animal diseases reported to the OIE between 2005 and 2023 are considered to pose a threat to human health due to their zoonotic potential. This is attributed to climate change and increased animal trade. The report emphasizes the importance of preventing animal diseases in reducing antibiotic use and combating antimicrobial resistance. If no action is taken, the report predicts that antimicrobial resistance could lead to significant losses in livestock, threatening the food security of 2 billion people and causing up to $10 trillion in economic losses by 2050. The OIE is urging countries to invest in strengthening their national veterinary services, improving global and regional coordination, and enhancing animal disease monitoring systems.

    "summary": "All experts forecast a low probability that antimicrobial drug sales for US livestock production will increase by at least 0.5% in 2024 relative to 2023. The consensus view is rooted in the long-term and recent downward or stable trend in medically important antimicrobial sales since 2017, largely due to strong and ongoing regulatory, stewardship, and consumer pressures. Factors such as continued FDA oversight, enforcement of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), retailer and industry self-regulation, innovation in diagnostics and vaccines, and public AMR concern are consistently cited as forces suppressing any increase in sales. While several experts acknowledge that disease outbreaks in 2024\u2014especially a surge in avian influenza\u2014could pose an upward risk and might cause a temporary spike in antibiotic usage, most assess this as insufficient to override entrenched stewardship trends and only a minor tail risk. Growth in the broader veterinary and livestock pharmaceutical markets is seen as not strongly linked to an increase in sales of medically important antimicrobials specifically for US livestock. The likelihood of a yes outcome (a >0.5% increase) is therefore uniformly judged as well below 50%, with almost all experts giving a probability of 16%, and a single outlier at 19%. The dominant expectation is for flat or declining sales, with a small but nonzero chance for a temporary uptick if an acute disease or supply shock were to occur.",
