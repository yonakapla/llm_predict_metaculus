Kim\u2019s pattern since 2021 shows a pivot from attention-seeking provocations to assertive but less escalatory moves, coinciding with improved support from Russia and China. The regime can extract significant geopolitical leverage by being 'ready' to test, without actually incurring the risk of international backlash from a detonation. With only about six weeks left and no signs of pre-test posture (e.g., suspicious bulked-up activity at the test site, on-site leadership inspections, evacuation or missile moves), the most probable scenario is continued saber-rattling but no actual test in the time window. Nonetheless, prudence dictates leaving a modest tail risk for strategic surprise or miscalculation, as North Korea has repeatedly confounded expectations. On an intelligence spectrum, the most compelling case is for 'no test before 2026,' though the threat remains real for the months that follow.",

However, actual behavior favors strategic patience: North Korea has curbed testing in 2025, is focused on strengthening ties with Russia and China, and is amplifying qualitative improvements rather than high-visibility provocations. There are incentives (US-South Korea alliance moves, internal regime stability, normalization ambitions) for a test, but also significant deterrents\u2014potential for unwanted escalation, Russian/Chinese caution, and the diplomatic context. Given less than six weeks remain, the window for maximal leverage from a test is closing, yet North Korea has repeatedly shown a willingness to push brinkmanship when other global crises could occupy Western attention. Balancing these factors, and incorporating Bayesian updating (recent deliberate restraint, despite high readiness), the probability should be higher than the long-term base rate, but not so high as to disregard recent behavioral and diplomatic restraint. Thus, assigning a probability in the high teens: likelihood is meaningfully present, but a new detonation remains less likely than not during the very narrow remaining time window.",

However, both South Korean and U.S. intel reports stress that North Korea 'could' test rather than 'will.' Furthermore, reduced missile tests in 2025 and a shift to alliance management with Russia/China suggest Kim Jong-un is currently prioritizing consolidation and leverage over the risk of sanctions and diplomatic isolation that would follow another test. Given current news as of November 2025, I see a plausible probability for a snap test but no acute trigger: U.S.-ROK moves (subs, uranium enrichment) and a deteriorating deterrence environment are provocative, but not obviously sufficient for Kim to risk a full-scale test before the deadline\u2014particularly with benefits flowing from Moscow and Beijing, and alternative escalation ladders (ICBM/satellite launches) still available.

It is consolidating nuclear status not via overt detonations, but through qualitative missile and warhead improvements, military parades, satellite launches, and media messaging. Testing quickly risks provoking a new round of international cohesion/sanctions against Pyongyang and potentially threatening the support it now enjoys from its principal partners. The cost-benefit calculation, rooted in North Korean strategic culture, militates for restraint barring an acute crisis. Nonetheless, the readiness and rhetorical posturing mean that a sudden test remains far from impossible if a contingency arises. Historically, tests cluster around moments of perceived entrapment, regime milestones, or gaps in external unity\u2014none of which are acutely present in the next six weeks.

The arguments supporting minor upward adjustment (to the mid/high 20s) don't present substantial new evidence compared to my initial weighting; if anything, the convergent skepticism about a test in this window\u2014combined with the conspicuous absence of warning indicators\u2014reinforces the prudence of my original estimate.

The consistent downweighting of risk by experts using indicators and warning, nonproliferation, and strategic culture frameworks highlights that (1) technical readiness and rhetorical saber-rattling have persisted for years without a test, (2) there is no evidence of acute crisis or imminent trigger, and (3) Kim Jong-un derives substantial benefit from ambiguity and coalition-building with Russia and China, which could be jeopardized by a test. There is also widespread agreement that North Korea is likely to preserve its leverage for a more opportune moment\u2014especially with the window now sharply constrained.

The strongest arguments in discussion repeatedly emphasized that, despite high technical readiness and elevated threat perceptions, there are no acute operational triggers or overt pre-test signals\u2014an absence consistently fatal to past short-term test predictions. Furthermore, the latest behavioral trend is toward deliberate ambiguity and leveraging brinkmanship without escalation, reinforced by Russia and China's strong preference for regional stability and opposition to a test that could undermine their influence. My critique of overestimation (especially versus deterministic or base-rate-heavy reasoning) was widely echoed, and the most compelling defenses further validated my stance: North Korea currently extracts maximum diplomatic and strategic leverage by being 'ready' to test without actually crossing the nuclear threshold. The likelihood of a surprise is not zero, but the regime's pattern since 2017, coupled with the narrow 41-day window and the lack of observable site activity, means the risk should be capped below one-in-three. I now judge that my original 28% figure slightly overshoots the best range given this collective scrutiny, especially as none of the new arguments deliver fresh evidence of impending crisis or acute internal trigger. On further reflection, the risk is best set squarely between the informed caution of top analytic approaches (17-23%) and the justifiable but slightly more risk-sensitive cluster, so I am revising downward.",

The trend toward ambiguity, regime consolidation, and maximum leverage *without* crossing the nuclear test threshold is a shared analytic core. The few outlier high forecasts are soundly and specifically critiqued for ignoring Kim\u2019s demonstrated preference for ambiguity and the elevation of deterrence and alliance management over escalation during this period. My original probability (30%) was already moderately above base rates, but now appears at risk of over-indexing the threat. On further reviewing the expert consensus and additional points on lack of test site activity, I am revising my forecast downward to 22%, closer to the well-justified cluster, better reflecting the current 6-week window of strategic ambiguity, and the strong incentives to delay rather than conduct a nuclear detonation.",

Strong critiques highlight that 'high readiness' has existed for nearly three years without actual testing taking place, and that North Korea is now reaping more regime benefit from strategic ambiguity and alliance leverage with Russia/China than from crossing the nuclear test threshold. My own logic about operational readiness and high incentives now seems weakly weighted relative to the pronounced trend of rational restraint.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nNorth Korea's nuclear program has a long history, but the [first North Korean nuclear test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_North_Korean_nuclear_test) was conducted On October 9, 2006. Its max yield was smaller than expected, with most sources estimating it as less than 1 kiloton of TNT. Since then, North Korea has conducted five more tests, with [the last one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_North_Korean_nuclear_test) taking place in 2017 and having a max yield between 50 and 260 kilotons.\n\nAt the time of this question, this is a total time period since the first test of 225 months that have passed since the first nuclear test. With 6 tests having been conducted, this is a base rate of 2.7% per month.&#x20;\n\nAccording to the [2025 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2025-Unclassified-Report.pdf) on page 28 (emphasis added):&#x20;\n\n> Kim remains committed to increasing the number of North Korea\u2019s nuclear warheads and improving its missile capabilities to threaten the Homeland and U.S. forces, citizens, and allies, and to weaken U.S. power in the AsiaPacific region, as evidenced by the pace of the North\u2019s missile flight tests and the regime\u2019s public touting of its uranium enrichment capabilities. **North Korea is probably prepared to conduct a nuclear test** and continues to flight test ICBMs so Kim can threaten the Homeland. Russia is increasingly supporting North Korea\u2019s nuclear status in exchange for Pyongyang\u2019s support to Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nThis is a Metaculus Learning Academy question.

The exercise, which began on October 21, 2025, featured B-52H Stratofortress bombers at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota loading AGM-86B nuclear-capable cruise missiles\u2014each capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and with a range exceeding 1,500 miles. The B-52H can carry up to 20 such missiles, and while 76 B-52Hs are in service, only 46 are nuclear-capable. The 5th Bomb Wing (Minot) and 2nd Bomb Wing (Barksdale Air Force Base) participated, alongside the 91st Missile Wing, which operates intercontinental ballistic missiles. The U.S. military emphasized that the exercise was not a response to any specific event and was designed to enhance combat readiness, assure allies, and reinforce strategic deterrence. The U.S. maintains an estimated 3,700 nuclear warheads\u2014the world\u2019s second-largest arsenal\u2014delivered via the nuclear triad of land-based ICBMs, aircraft, and submarines. The U.S. continues to modernize its nuclear forces and develop a homeland defense shield amid advancements by nuclear-armed adversaries like Russia, China, and North Korea. According to U.S. Air Force Colonel Jesse Lamarand, the exercise showcased the 'teamwork, readiness, and combat capability' essential for strategic deterrence. Minot Air Force Base confirmed the exercise included training across all STRATCOM mission areas with a focus on nuclear readiness.

The tests used inert bombs identical in design to combat models but without nuclear warheads, allowing full validation of the aircraft, crew, and weapon systems under realistic conditions. The F-35A became the only fifth-generation fighter certified for nuclear missions, surpassing its Russian (Su-57) and Chinese (J-20) counterparts, which have not yet received approval for such roles. The tests included a new thermal pre-conditioning process to simulate extreme temperature and vibration conditions expected during real missions, ensuring reliability. According to Jeffrey Boyd of Sandia National Laboratories, the tests represented 'the most ambitious surveillance effort in a year to date and the most ambitious we will see in the foreseeable future.' The B61-12, developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory since the 1960s, has a yield of 50 kilotons and features advanced safety, protection, and guidance systems. The U.S. is also developing the B61-13, a more powerful bomb with a 360-kiloton yield\u201424 times Hiroshima and 14 times Nagasaki\u2014featuring upgraded guidance from Boeing\u2019s tail kit for precision strikes and subterranean detonations up to 1 megaton. The test comes amid rising nuclear tensions, with Russia claiming successful tests of its Poseidon nuclear torpedo and former U.S. President Donald Trump calling for renewed nuclear testing. However, the U.S. Department of Energy confirmed that current tests do not include full nuclear detonations, and the U.S. remains under its moratorium on nuclear testing since the 1990s.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 06:48 PM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/novaceno/2025-11-18/eeuu-china-rusia-aviacion-prueba-nuclear-f-35_4249854/)\n\n**North Korea's Most Precious Weapon: Uranium Enrichment and Regional Nuclear Tensions**\nThe world faces a growing contradiction: as nuclear risks increase in scale and complexity, transparency to address them diminishes. Corea del Norte is at the center of global concern, with South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young warning of potential uranium enrichment amid heightened nuclear tensions. According to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), North Korea currently possesses approximately 2,000 kilograms of highly enriched uranium (90% purity or higher), sufficient to produce up to 100 nuclear weapons. The FAS also reported that North Korea's uranium centrifuges are operational across four facilities. In its 2024 report, the FAS estimated that North Korea has produced enough fissile material for nearly 90 weapons, though it likely has built only around 50. This assessment aligns with South Korea's concerns. Pyongyang has warned that South Korea\u2019s nuclear submarine development plans\u2014announced by President Lee Jae Myung in a recent U.S.-South Korea security agreement\u2014constitute a 'strategic maneuver' toward nuclear militarization, triggering a 'domino effect' and sparking a dangerous regional arms race. The statement was issued by the North Korean state media agency KCNA. These developments follow a message from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who urged leaders to convey his 'warmest regards' to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un as they 'conspire against the United States.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/mundo/articulo/esta-es-el-arma-mas-preciada-de-corea-del-norte-que-hace-temblar-a-varias-potencias-en-el-mundo/202526/)\n\n**China's Missile Silo Expansion Raises National Security Concerns: U.S. Congress Sounds Alarm**\nThe U.S. Congressional report released on November 18, 2025, by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) warns that China's military expansion has entered a 'combat readiness state.' The report states that China has built approximately 350 new intercontinental missile silos and increased its nuclear warhead count by 20% over the past year. China is integrating artificial intelligence into weapon platforms to develop a force capable of confronting the United States even with fewer nuclear warheads. The report highlights that China\u2019s military advancements, combined with its political repression and economic coercion, could enable Beijing to act more swiftly and decisively in crises, significantly reducing U.S. and allied response time and increasing military preparedness pressure. The report also notes that the U.S. lacks a robust cross-agency coordination mechanism, which may undermine its deterrence capability and erode its long-standing strategic advantage in the Indo-Pacific. It urges Congress to conduct both classified and unclassified assessments of U.S. ability to respond to simultaneous threats from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea. On Taiwan, the report calls for a re-evaluation of U.S. obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act, stressing the need to assess U.S. military readiness to defend Taiwan and acknowledging the possibility that the U.S. may not fully fulfill its commitments. China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with U.S. Defense Department estimates projecting a goal of 1,000 by 2030. The report notes China\u2019s public display of new missile systems and its adoption of a 6G-integrated AI electronic warfare system capable of remotely disrupting and intercepting U.S. radar signals in Guam, the Marshall Islands, and Alaska via high-speed data links. The commission warns that a Taiwan Strait conflict could cause global GDP to drop by 10%, comparable to the 2008 financial crisis, with risks of nuclear escalation and broader regional conflict. The report concludes with 28 policy recommendations, including restricting Chinese-made components in U.S. power grids, establishing a unified export control agency, strengthening diplomatic support for Taiwan, and cautioning about China\u2019s past use of 'church diplomacy' to isolate the Vatican, thus urging the U.S. to be more proactive in supporting Taiwan.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 03:38 PM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2025/11/18/a104039578.html)\n\n**North Korea Says Seoul-US Sub Deal Will Trigger 'Nuclear Domino' Effect**\nNorth Korea condemned a newly announced agreement between South Korea and the United States to develop nuclear-powered submarines, warning in a state media commentary on November 18, 2025, that the deal would trigger a 'nuclear domino phenomenon' in the region and spark a hot arms race. The Korean Central News Agency stated that South Korea's pursuit of nuclear submarine capabilities, including expanded authority over uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing, represented a 'dangerous attempt at confrontation' and reflected a 'confrontational intention' by Seoul and Washington. North Korea further declared it would take 'more justified and realistic countermeasures' in response. This statement follows North Korea's October 2025 test of its ninth and final ballistic engine, signaling readiness for a full intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch in the near future. The commentary was released just one day after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung proposed military talks with Pyongyang\u2014the first such offer in seven years\u2014and extended an invitation for broader, precondition-free discussions, marking a shift from the hawkish stance of his conservative predecessor. Analyst Yang Moo-jin noted the move is likely to negatively affect prospects for inter-Korean military talks, as North Korea has not yet responded.

According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the deal 'destabilizes military security in Asia-Pacific beyond the Korean Peninsula and causes international nuclear instability.' Pyongyang stated the submarine program constitutes a 'dangerous provocation' and will inevitably lead to a 'reckless arms race' and an 'inevitable nuclear domino effect' in the region. North Korea also declared it will take 'more realistic countermeasures.' In contrast, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that Seoul has no hostile intent toward North Korea and continues efforts to reduce tensions and rebuild trust. South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung announced the completion of a broader security and trade agreement with the U.S., including plans for nuclear-powered vessels, and confirmed support for expanding South Korea's uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing capabilities. The announcement comes after North Korea conducted its ninth and final ballistic missile engine test in October, with indications that a full-scale test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) could occur in the coming months.

Korea: US OK of Seoul nuke subs drive sparks 'nuclear domino'**\nNorth Korea issued a strong reaction on November 18, 2025, condemning the United States' approval of South Korea's plan to develop nuclear-powered submarines, calling it a 'serious development' that threatens regional stability and risks triggering a 'nuclear domino phenomenon' across the Asia-Pacific. In a lengthy commentary published by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korea denounced the joint fact sheet released by the U.S. and South Korea following summits between President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump in August and October 2025, as well as the annual Security Consultative Meeting communique. The North accused Washington of formalizing a confrontational stance toward Pyongyang and criticized the U.S. support for South Korea's pursuit of uranium enrichment and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing capabilities, labeling it as 'laying a springboard for' Seoul to become a 'quasi-nuclear weapons state.' North Korea also rejected the joint commitment to 'complete denuclearization' of the DPRK, calling it 'the most vivid manifestation' of the Trump administration\u2019s policy of confrontation. The KCNA warned that the DPRK will take 'more justified and realistic countermeasures' to defend its sovereignty and regional peace. Notably, North Korea did not issue a statement in the name of government officials, nor did it directly name Trump or Lee, and it has not responded to Trump\u2019s recent proposal for a summit with Kim Jong-un, who previously stated that dialogue remains possible if denuclearization is not made a precondition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 05:26 AM\nSource:[Inquirer](https://globalnation.inquirer.net/298708/n-korea-us-approval-of-seouls-nuke-subs-drive-sparks-nuclear-domino)\n\n**Pyongyang Warns Nuclear Submarine Deal Between Seoul and Washington Could Trigger 'Domino Effect'**\nNorth Korea strongly condemned the recent agreement between South Korea and the United States to develop nuclear-powered submarines, warning that it would trigger a 'nuclear domino effect' in the region.

Seoul stated it received 'support to expand its authority over uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel.' In its first official response, North Korea's state media called the agreement a 'dangerous move' and a 'serious attempt at confrontation.' The Korean Central News Agency claimed the deal 'seriously undermines military security stability in the Asia-Pacific region beyond the Korean Peninsula and leads to uncontrollable nuclear conditions globally.' North Korea warned that South Korea's acquisition of nuclear submarines would inevitably cause a 'nuclear domino effect' and spark a 'frenzied arms race' in the region, stating it will take 'more realistic countermeasures.'

China, historically possessing a modest nuclear arsenal, is rapidly expanding its capabilities and may achieve strategic parity with the U.S. by the mid-2030s. Russia is developing a new generation of nuclear systems aimed at striking targets on U.S. territory. Unlike the U.S. and Russia, China is not bound by international arms control agreements and is freely increasing its nuclear stockpile. According to experts, the U.S. has 5,117 nuclear warheads (including retired ones), Russia has 5,459, and China has approximately 600. North Korea, with around 50 warheads, continues advancing its missile and submarine delivery systems. The WSJ notes that previous U.S. nuclear modernization strategies assumed stable threat levels from Russia, China, and North Korea\u2014assumptions now deemed inaccurate. Former Pentagon official Matthew Krieger describes the current era as the 'third nuclear age,' increasingly resembling the Cold War. China is not seeking negotiations until it achieves parity with the U.S. and Russia; some Chinese analysts openly state their goal is to create a deterrent so strong that the U.S. would be unable to consider using nuclear weapons against China. Meanwhile, Russia, amid the war in Ukraine, frequently issues nuclear threats to influence Western support for Kyiv. However, experts note that systems like 'Burevestnik' and 'Poseidon' are not operationally ready and serve primarily as tools of coercion. According to Fabian Hoffmann of the University of Oslo, Russia relies on psychological deterrence, while China focuses on steadily increasing the number of warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles. In October 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to prepare for resuming nuclear tests 'in response to programs of other nations.' On the night of November 15, 2025, Trump stated that tests could occur 'fairly soon,' though he did not specify the type of testing.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 05:42 PM\nSource:[NEWS.am](http://news.am/rus/news/915732.html)\n\n**Why the US is now facing a two-front nuclear arms race**\nThe United States is now engaged in a two-front nuclear arms race with both Russia and China, marking a shift from the Cold War's bipolar deterrence model. China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, aiming for rough parity with the U.S. by the mid-2030s and developing a full nuclear triad\u2014land-, sea-, and air-launched systems\u2014evident in its September 2024 military parade where Xi Jinping appeared alongside Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, signaling a strategic alignment. Russia, despite having the world\u2019s largest nuclear stockpile, is leveraging nuclear threats and exotic weapons like the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and Poseidon underwater drone to offset conventional weaknesses in Ukraine, using psychological warfare to deter Western support. U.S. nuclear modernization plans, designed for a bilateral framework with Russia and minimal Chinese threat, are now outdated. A bipartisan commission has recommended expanding the U.S. arsenal for the first time in decades to deter both powers simultaneously. Concerns are growing over the risk of escalation in multi-theater conflicts involving Europe, Taiwan, and the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. has not conducted a full-yield nuclear test since 1992, but intelligence suggests Russia and China may be conducting more advanced underground tests, prompting debate over whether the U.S. should resume testing\u2014though this could trigger a global testing cascade. Strategists now describe this era as a 'third nuclear age'\u2014more complex, unstable, and dangerous, with multiple nuclear-armed powers, overlapping regional crises, and a diminished role for arms control, raising urgent questions about adapting deterrence in a multipolar nuclear world.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 09:04 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/world/why-the-us-is-now-facing-a-two-front-nuclear-arms-race-article-13680554.html)\n\n**Rising Nuclear Posturing by U.S., China, and Russia: A Return to Cold War-Style Arms Race**\nA renewed nuclear arms race among major powers\u2014particularly the United States, China, and Russia\u2014is intensifying, according to a report by Yonhap News Agency on November 17, 2025. The United States, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s stated desire to reduce its nuclear arsenal, has declared it will not proceed with cuts unless rivals follow suit. In October, the U.S. announced it would resume nuclear testing for the first time since 1992, after a 33-year hiatus. Russia has repeatedly used nuclear threats to deter U.S. military aid to Ukraine and recently deployed nuclear weapons to Belarus. It has also publicly confirmed successful tests of the 'Burevestnik' nuclear-powered intercontinental cruise missile and the 'Poseidon' nuclear-powered underwater drone. While the U.S. and Russia are adhering to the New START treaty, which expires in February 2026, China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal without such constraints. U.S. estimates project China will match U.S. deployed warhead levels by the mid-2030s. China revealed its nuclear triad\u2014land, sea, and air-based capabilities\u2014at the September 2024 National Day military parade in Beijing. As of the report, the U.S. possesses 5,177 nuclear warheads (including retired ones), Russia has 5,459, China has 600, and North Korea is estimated to have around 50 warheads. North Korea has strengthened its military ties with Russia following a strategic partnership treaty. Atlantic Council researcher Matthew Kroenig warned that the world is entering a 'third nuclear age,' more reminiscent of the Cold War than the post-Cold War era. The report highlights the 'simultaneity problem'\u2014a scenario in which China\u2019s military action against Taiwan could trigger Russian aggression against NATO members and a North Korean invasion of South Korea simultaneously. Former U.S. NCG representative and MIT nuclear security expert P. R. Kumaraswamy stated that the U.S. nuclear modernization program was based on the assumption that Russia would continue arms reductions and China and North Korea would not challenge the status quo\u2014assumptions now proven false. He warned that if conflicts erupt in Europe and the Indo-Pacific at the same time, the U.S. could face severe overextension, lacking sufficient forces and resources to respond effectively.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 07:33 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251117120900009)\n\n**Global: Proliferation of Weapons and Nuclear Threats in the Modern Era**\nGlobal nuclear security concerns have resurged in the current international landscape, with the world once again facing geopolitical uncertainty and a renewed arms race. Following the end of the Cold War, nuclear stockpiles declined significantly, but recent conflicts in Ukraine, tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and U.S.-China rivalry have reignited nuclear competition. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), there were 12,241 nuclear warheads globally as of January 2025, with 9,614 in military stockpiles and 2,100 on high alert. Russia and the United States still hold nearly 90% of global nuclear weapons, but China is emerging as the third-largest nuclear power, expected to possess over 1,000 warheads by 2030. North Korea continues advancing its ballistic and nuclear tests to assert its status as a regional nuclear power. The proliferation of nuclear technology to developing nations remains a growing concern, despite the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran maintains uranium enrichment capabilities despite the collapse of the 2015 JCPOA, while India and Pakistan expand their long-range missile systems, including nuclear-capable delivery vehicles. The deployment of China\u2019s DF-5C intercontinental ballistic missiles during military parades symbolizes its strategic nuclear advancement. Asia South remains a high-risk zone for nuclear conflict, with emerging dual-use technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs) and mobile launch systems accelerating proliferation risks. Non-state actors could exploit these technologies through illicit markets or scientific cooperation. New threats include cyberattacks on nuclear command systems, sabotage of nuclear facilities, and the potential use of radioactive materials to create 'dirty bombs.' The IAEA reports over 100 annual incidents of radioactive material smuggling, with even small quantities posing significant risks. Diplomatic efforts are weakened by veto power conflicts in the UN Security Council, with the U.S. and allies accusing Russia and China of blocking sanctions, while Moscow criticizes U.S. hypocrisy in maintaining its arsenal. Non-nuclear states feel marginalized by the two-tier system of the NPT, leading some\u2014like Japan and South Korea\u2014to strengthen missile defenses, despite remaining under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Technological advancements in AI, automation, and advanced materials are lowering the cost and increasing the efficiency of weapon development, including hypersonic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads at five times the speed of sound. Small modular reactors (SMRs) and improvements in guidance systems further challenge existing arms control agreements. Malaysia remains committed to a nuclear-free Southeast Asia, having signed the Bangkok Treaty (SEANWFZ) in 1995 and ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). Its HANRUH defense doctrine emphasizes holistic national resilience, including nuclear, energy, and radiological security. Regional cooperation within ASEAN is critical to ensuring the integrity of the nuclear-free zone and reinforcing Malaysia\u2019s role as a proponent of collective security and peaceful diplomacy. The world now stands at a critical juncture where technological progress must be matched by human wisdom. The choices made by global powers today will determine whether the 21st century becomes an era of nuclear peace or a new age of destruction. Diplomacy must be revitalized, and disarmament negotiations must be inclusive and realistic.\nOriginal language: id\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[airtimes.my](https://www.airtimes.my/2025/11/14/global-proliferasi-senjata-dan-ancaman-nuklear-di-era-moden/)\n\n**North Korea May Conduct 7th Nuclear Test Anytime, South Korea Warns Amid Expanded Nuclear and Missile Capabilities**\nSouth Korea's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reported on November 5, 2025, that North Korea could conduct its seventh nuclear test within a short timeframe if Kim Jong-un decides to proceed, with the Punggye-ri Site's No. 3 tunnel already prepared for such an operation. The agency stated that North Korea has been expanding uranium enrichment facilities in Yongbyon to secure more nuclear materials and constructing facilities capable of mass-producing various types of nuclear warheads. The report noted that North Korea formally enshrined 'nuclear weapons possession and development' in its constitution in September 2023, aiming to normalize its nuclear status internationally through continuous demonstrations of capability. South Korea\u2019s DIA assessed that North Korea\u2019s medium- and intercontinental-range ballistic missiles (ICBMs) now have a flight range exceeding 13,000 kilometers, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland; although current tests used high-arcing trajectories, it is believed North Korea is attempting to verify key technologies through normal-angle launches. The report also indicated that North Korea is preparing to launch additional reconnaissance satellites with higher resolution, supported by Russian technology. While North Korea has temporarily halted the release of propaganda balloons into South Korea, the DIA noted that the threat remains, with continued surveillance of over ten potential drop zones showing personnel and vehicle activity. Additionally, the report confirmed that North Korea has resumed operations at some facilities in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, primarily those producing light industry and essential civilian goods.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 08:42 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8C%97%E9%9F%93%E6%81%90%E7%AC%AC7%E6%AC%A1%E6%A0%B8%E8%A9%A6%E9%A9%97-%E5%8D%97%E9%9F%93%E6%83%85%E5%A0%B1%E6%9C%AC%E9%83%A8-%E8%8B%A5%E9%87%91%E6%AD%A3%E6%81%A9%E4%B8%8B%E4%BB%A4%E5%8F%AF%E5%9C%A8%E7%9F%AD%E6%99%82%E9%96%93%E5%85%A7%E9%80%B2%E8%A1%8C-044200819.html)\n\n**North Korea's Nuclear Test Feasible in Short Time, South Korea's Defense Ministry Says**\nThe South Korean Ministry of National Defense's Defense Intelligence Agency reported to the National Assembly on November 5, 2025, that North Korea could conduct a nuclear test within a 'very short time' at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site if Kim Jong-un, the Supreme Leader, makes the decision.

The DIA report, presented during a closed-door parliamentary audit on Wednesday, states that North Korea is accelerating nuclear warhead production, expanding fissile material enrichment at Yongbyon and other sites, and building multiple production lines for various warhead types. The country has enshrined nuclear forces in its constitution and is actively demonstrating capabilities to pressure the international community into tacitly accepting its nuclear status. North Korea is also advancing long-range missile capabilities, with intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) assessed to have a range exceeding 13,000 kilometers (8,078 miles), capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. The agency notes progress in developing hypersonic cruise missiles and preparing to deploy four types of short-range ballistic missiles and multiple 600-millimeter rocket launchers. North Korea is enhancing nuclear retaliation capabilities through improved R-class submarines and underwater launch platforms, including nuclear submarine construction. The DIA reports that North Korea is preparing additional satellite launches with Russian technical assistance to obtain higher-resolution reconnaissance satellites, and has exported approximately 300 short-range ballistic missiles to Russia since October 2023, many of which are believed to have been used in Ukraine. Some factories in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, previously operated by South Korean companies, appear to have been restarted, particularly those related to daily necessities and light industry. Psychological operations against South Korea continue, including maintained capabilities for balloon launches and active loudspeaker broadcasts\u2014though loudspeaker broadcasts were halted in June, about 40 locations remain operational. The DIA also warns of North Korea modernizing its conventional forces, introducing small vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial vehicles and new main battle tanks, with modernization projected to be completed around 2027. China\u2019s exports to North Korea rose sharply after the September 4 summit between Kim Jong-un and President Xi Jinping, with North Korea-bound exports increasing by about 30% year-on-year and 54% month-on-month in September.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 06:11 AM\nSource:[\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-11-05/national/defense/North-prepared-to-carry-out-another-nuclear-test-on-short-notice-DIA/2437283)\n\n**North Korea's Nuclear and Military Readiness: A Threat to Regional Stability**\nThe National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported on November 5, 2025, that North Korea is capable of conducting a nuclear test within a short time using the third tunnel at Punggye-ri if Kim Jong-un decides to do so. The NIS highlighted North Korea's ongoing nuclear capability enhancement, including expansion of uranium enrichment facilities at Yongbyon, development of infrastructure for producing multiple types and quantities of nuclear warheads, and continued advancement in missile development. This includes deploying short-range cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), 600mm multiple rocket launchers, and focusing on hypersonic cruise missiles to evade South Korea's defense systems. North Korea is believed to have achieved flight ranges exceeding 13,000 km for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), with recent tests suggesting efforts to verify key technologies for normal-angle launches. The country is also advancing submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) capabilities through the modernization of Type R submarines and the secretive development of underwater launch platforms. North Korea is preparing to launch a higher-resolution reconnaissance satellite with Russian technical support. Although balloon propaganda flights were suspended after November 2024, the capability remains active, with ongoing personnel and vehicle activity at over ten designated launch sites. The NIS confirmed that parts of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, particularly light industry and essential consumer goods factories, are operational. The dismantling of the Kaesong Comprehensive Support Center began on December 18, 2024, with 11 of 15 floors already demolished. North Korea is actively modernizing its conventional forces, including rapid development of small vertical takeoff and landing drones for reconnaissance and attack, with a significant increase in test flights and crew training. The country is also developing large naval vessels, with two major warships launched between April and June 2025, following Kim Jong-un\u2019s directive to build two ships annually. Kim is reportedly focusing on consolidating power ahead of the 9th Party Congress, strengthening loyalty among elite factions to ensure regime stability. The NIS warned that North Korea is attempting to entrench a hostile, two-state relationship with South Korea by advancing military demarcation line (MDL) borderization, constructing barriers in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), and maintaining continuous GPS jamming and nationwide loudspeaker broadcasts. Although one loudspeaker site was dismantled, two new ones were added, increasing the total to over 40. North Korea is also demonstrating its alliance with Russia and China\u2014exhibiting military cooperation with Russia, including deployment of troops to Kursk for border and mine-clearing operations, and receiving military technology transfer. Lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war are being applied to North Korean forces, with intensified summer training, doubling of core infantry and artillery exercises, and expanded drone and unmanned systems use. Bilateral relations with China have significantly improved since Kim Jong-un\u2019s September 4 meeting with Xi Jinping, with Chinese exports to North Korea increasing by 30% annually and by 54% month-on-month in August.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251105089351001)\n\n**Defense Intelligence Headquarters: Kim Jong-un's Decision Could Enable Rapid Nuclear Test**\nThe Defense Intelligence Headquarters reported on November 5, 2025, that North Korea could conduct a nuclear test within a short timeframe if Kim Jong-un, the State Affairs Commission Chairman, makes the decision. The report, delivered during a parliamentary audit at the National Assembly's Committee on National Security, stated that using the third tunnel at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site in North Hamgyong Province\u2019s Kusong County, North Korea could rapidly resume nuclear testing. Although the Punggye-ri site was closed after its sixth nuclear test in 2017, recent signs indicate partial restoration of some tunnels. The Defense Intelligence Headquarters analyzed that North Korea has enshrined nuclear capability enhancement and weapons possession in its constitution, effectively seeking international de facto acceptance. The agency also assessed that North Korea has expanded uranium enrichment capacity at Yongbyon, establishing the foundation for producing multiple nuclear warheads simultaneously. Yongbyon, the central hub of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, is known as a key facility capable of both plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment. Furthermore, North Korea is preparing to deploy short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), four types of SRBMs, 600mm multiple rocket launchers, long-range cruise missiles using solid fuel, and mid-range missiles, including hypersonic cruise missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the U.S. mainland with a range exceeding 13,000 kilometers. The agency also reported that North Korea is advancing underwater launch systems, including improved 'R-class' submarines and nuclear-powered submarines, with Russian technical support, and is preparing to launch a high-resolution reconnaissance satellite. Additionally, it analyzed that North Korea has exported approximately 300 short-range ballistic missiles to Russia since October of the previous year, with these weapons being used in the Ukraine war.

North Korea is reportedly receiving real-world missile experience and performance improvements through Russian missile exports, having supplied over 300 short-range ballistic missiles to Russia since October 2023, which are being used in the war in Ukraine. Additionally, the NIS reported that North Korea is preparing to modernize its submarine forces by developing improved R-class submarines and secretly building nuclear-capable underwater launch platforms, including nuclear-powered submarines. Regarding military reconnaissance satellites, North Korea is reportedly preparing additional launches under Russian technical support to acquire higher-resolution satellites than its current fleet. Furthermore, Rep. Lee Sung-kwon of the People Power Party confirmed that North Korea has partially restarted operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex, particularly in light industries and essential consumer goods factories, with some facilities previously built by South Korean companies now being operated by North Korea.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 05:05 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/politics_general/1227526.html)\n\n**North Korea Can Conduct Nuclear Test at Punggye-ri Within Short Time, South Korea's National Intelligence Service Warns**\nThe National Intelligence Service (NIS) of South Korea stated on November 5, 2025, during a parliamentary oversight hearing in Seoul\u2019s Yeouido district, that North Korea could conduct a nuclear test at the Punggye-ri Site\u2019s No. 3 tunnel within a very short time if Kim Jong-un decides to do so. The NIS emphasized that North Korea has continued to advance its nuclear capabilities, formally enshrining nuclear weapons possession and development in its constitution in September 2023, and is actively seeking implicit international acceptance of its nuclear status. The country is expanding uranium enrichment capacity at Yongbyon and building infrastructure for the mass production of multiple nuclear warheads. North Korea is also advancing the development of various military reconnaissance satellites, with plans to deploy solid-fuel cruise missiles, four types of short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and 600mm multiple rocket launchers soon. For medium-range missiles, the focus is on hypersonic cruise missile development to evade South Korea\u2019s defense systems. The NIS reported that North Korea has achieved a flight range of over 13,000 km for its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), sufficient to reach the U.S. mainland. Additionally, North Korea is preparing to modernize its R-class submarines and covertly developing nuclear-powered submarines and underwater launch platforms. The country is also enhancing its reconnaissance satellite capabilities with higher resolution, supported by Russian technology, and has reportedly exported over 300 short-range ballistic missiles to Russia since October 2023, with these weapons being used in the Ukraine war.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20251105_0003391065)\n\n**Kim Jong Un Curbs Missile Tests, Expands Nuclear Arsenal**\nNorth Korea has significantly reduced its missile testing in 2025, conducting only about a dozen public weapons tests\u2014far fewer than the typical 20 to 30 launches per year, according to South Korean defense officials. This slowdown follows years of intense activity, including over 40 launches in 2022 and 23 in a single day. On October 22, 2025, Pyongyang announced the successful test of two short-range hypersonic missiles, its first launch since August, with state media publishing images of the projectiles hitting inland targets. Hypersonic missiles, capable of traveling at least five times the speed of sound and maneuvering mid-flight, pose a growing challenge to U.S. and allied missile defense systems. According to the Wall Street Journal, Kim Jong Un\u2019s shift reflects a strategic pivot from frequent testing to consolidating North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear power by focusing on developing and mass-producing advanced weapons, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, tactical nuclear warheads, and reconnaissance satellites. This aligns with the final phase of Kim\u2019s five-year weapons plan announced in 2021. Hong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, stated that 'the qualitative aspect of testing has become more important than the sheer number of launches,' indicating Kim\u2019s confidence in achieving key military goals. The reduced testing coincides with strengthened ties with Russia and China, including North Korea\u2019s reported supply of artillery and short-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine in exchange for oil, food, and technical assistance. Analysts suggest Russian cooperation is aiding North Korea\u2019s development of missile guidance systems and solid-fuel propulsion. Jeon Kyung-joo, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, noted that 'with Russian support and steady oil supplies, its weapons factories are running at higher capacity.' The shift reflects a broader geopolitical realignment in Northeast Asia, with Pyongyang aligning with Moscow and Beijing against Washington and its allies. Kim has declared North Korea a nuclear-armed state and signaled future efforts will focus on upgrading conventional forces. U.S. officials warn that deeper cooperation with Russia could accelerate North Korea\u2019s weapons advancements while undermining international sanctions. A U.S. Congressional Research Service report states that Pyongyang views its nuclear arsenal as 'a guarantor of regime survival,' reducing incentives for denuclearization talks. Despite claims of progress, experts note that many of North Korea\u2019s advancements remain unverified, and much of its arsenal may not yet be operationally deployable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/kim-jong-un-north-korea-missile/2025/10/23/id/1231575/)\n\n**North Korea Accelerates Ballistic Missile Development Amid Growing Military Cooperation with Russia, Heightening Threat to North America**\nThe Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, compiled from U.S. intelligence sources such as the DNI and DIA, projects that North Korea will accelerate its ballistic\u2011missile development program as military cooperation with Russia grows after the Ukraine war.  The report notes that Kim\u202fJong\u202fUn has repeatedly rejected denuclearization talks since the 2019 Trump\u2011Kim summit, and that over the past decade North Korea has expanded its nuclear and missile capabilities, thereby increasing threats to the U.S. mainland, U.S. allies in East Asia, and U.S. interests.  CRS cites the DNI\u2019s 2025 Annual Threat Assessment (ATA) stating that North Korea prioritizes \"ballistic\u2011missile power to evade U.S. and regional missile\u2011defense systems, improve precision\u2011strike capability, and endanger U.S. and allied forces.\"  It also reports that Russia is providing space, nuclear, and missile technology, expertise, and materials to North Korea, potentially accelerating the WMD program over the next 3\u20135 years.  The 2021 five\u2011year defense plan outlined by North Korea includes new nuclear submarines, tactical nuclear weapons, multiple\u2011warhead missiles, and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with a 15,000\u2011km range and ground\u2011 and sea\u2011based solid\u2011fuel ICBMs.  CRS predicts that North Korea will conduct more missile tests later this year to meet those goals.  The report highlights the October 2023 launch of the ICBM \"\ud654\uc131\u201119,\" which \"seems capable of carrying nuclear warheads across North America,\" according to a U.S. senior official\u2019s April testimony.  DIA estimates North Korea currently possesses fewer than 10 ICBMs but could field 50 by 2035.  Some experts estimate that North Korea has produced up to 90 nuclear warheads but has assembled roughly 50.  The report also notes that North Korea has restored its nuclear test site and is ready for a seventh test, and that it has revealed tactical nuclear warheads that could be mounted on at least eight launch vehicles, including unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and cruise missiles.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 11:43 PM\nSource:[\uad6d\ubbfc\uc77c\ubcf4](https://www.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0028756552)\n\n**Russia\u2019s Support Fuels North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Build\u2011Up Amid International Isolation**\nRussia\u2019s backing has accelerated North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes, according to experts and recent tests.  After Kim Jong\u2011un accepted an invitation to attend China\u2019s Victory Day parade, he will meet President Vladimir Putin, signalling a deepening partnership that could speed up the delivery of Russian air\u2011defence systems and missile technology.  In 2021 Kim announced a five\u2011year plan to build more nuclear weapons; since then he has made \"surprising progress,\" says Bruce Bennett of the RAND Corporation, noting that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has opened a \"new era of friendship\" between Pyongyang and Moscow.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear activity has remained limited.  The last test was in 2017, when a device reportedly detonated with a 6.3\u2011magnitude shockwave.  Yet the regime continues to produce weapons\u2011grade uranium and has shown advances in missile technology.  In March 2023 it unveiled the Hwasan\u201131, a 46\u2011centimetre tactical nuclear warhead, and in 2024 it launched a ballistic missile carrying three independent warheads, a test that the South Korean army said failed but that Van Diepen described as \"evidence that Kim has advanced enough to justify a flight test.\"  The missile travelled more than 930 miles at 12 times the speed of sound.\n\nOther milestones include a 2023 successful launch of a reconnaissance satellite, a 2024 test of a hypersonic glide vehicle, and the unveiling of a nuclear\u2011powered submarine in March 2025.  Experts warn that Russian assistance could \"accelerate technological progress\" and that the regime may now feel \"more confident\" to take risks against South Korea.\n\n\"In the future, if the North Koreans detect the right moment, they can create enormous instability in the region,\" cautions Go Myong\u2011hyun of the Seoul Institute of Security Strategy.  Lami Kim of the Daniel K. Inouye Asia\u2011Pacific Center for Security Studies notes that with Russia\u2019s help, North Korea could realistically build nuclear\u2011powered submarines, a feat achieved only by six countries.\n\nThe article presents a balanced view, citing analysts and official statements, and does not overtly favour or condemn any side.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 05:05 AM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/wapo/2025/08/29/el-apoyo-de-rusia-impulsa-el-rearme-nuclear-del-regimen-de-corea-del-norte-pese-su-aislamiento-internacional/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse group of forecasting experts\u2014from intelligence analysts to political scientists and area specialists\u2014the consensus is that while North Korea is technically and logistically prepared to conduct a nuclear test (with the Punggye-ri site confirmed ready by multiple intelligence agencies), the near-term probability of such a test before January 1, 2026, remains below 50%. Most experts estimate the chance in the low to high 10s or 20s percent, with only one notable outlier (Rational Actor Model) assigning a much higher probability (65%). The most cited factors increasing probability are technical readiness, regime emphasis on its nuclear status, and regional escalatory dynamics (notably U.S.-South Korea nuclear submarine deals, and North Korea's strengthened alignment with Russia and China). However, these are counterbalanced by recent patterns of restraint: North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since 2017, has shifted toward qualitative improvements and missile/satellite launches, and is currently extracting considerable benefits (diplomatic, economic, and technical) from Russia and China\u2014both of whom may prefer to avoid regional destabilization from a new test. Experts repeatedly note the absence of imminent triggers (such as major regime milestones or acute crises), lack of last-minute preparation signals, and historical tendencies to reserve nuclear testing for particular milestones or strategic shocks. The probabilities quoted by the panel range (except the outlier) from 8% to 30%, with most clustering in the high teens to mid-20s, reflecting elevated but not overwhelming risk. Common projected 'No' scenarios emphasize ongoing missile development and strategic posturing without the costly step of a nuclear detonation, while 'Yes' scenarios involve a sharp external catalyst forcing a shift in regime calculus, or a dramatic need for internal or international signaling. Overall, the group expects continued brinkmanship and potential missile or satellite activity, but finds a new nuclear test before 2026 somewhat unlikely\u2014unless the strategic environment changes suddenly and dramatically.",
