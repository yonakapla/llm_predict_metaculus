Current consensus and caretaker arrangements are specifically designed to preclude dramatic new non-caretaker appointments until elections are held.

While a further crisis could radically alter this calculus and Lamichhane is consistently mentioned as a possible alternative, his lack of parliamentary majority, legal baggage, and elite aversion put him at the margins. A nonzero risk remains if the crisis deepens, but most evidence supports his exclusion from immediate consideration.

Critiques of 24% probabilities are persuasive: even in highly unstable contexts, the transition pathway for someone like Lamichhane is extremely narrow and would require an even greater breakdown than we have yet seen. Thus, I remain at 8%, as there is no credible path for him to fulfill the constitutional criteria before January 1, 2026, absent truly extraordinary developments.",

While critiques noted that this might slightly underweight the unique volatility and popular disruption of the Gen-Z uprising, defenses and the broader deliberation affirmed that even in volatile post-uprising Nepal, actual 'outsider leapfrogs' to the premiership remain extremely rare within such compressed timelines when facing severe legal impediments and lack of elite/military buy-in. Some minority voices advocated for an even lower probability, but I judge that 24%\u2014while bold for a candidate in Lamichhane's current position\u2014already properly discounts for the small but non-negligible risk of further dramatic upheaval or anti-elite momentum. There is insufficient new evidence or argument to justify moving meaningfully lower or higher at this juncture.",

Multiple forecasters independently cited the overwhelming legal, procedural, and coalition impediments to Lamichhane's rise, echoing my legalist and base-rate perspective. Critiques of higher probabilities (e.g., 24%) were persuasive, pointing to the rarity\u2014even in volatile South Asian contexts\u2014of jailed or recently released populists making a successful and swift return in the absence of a total institutional vacuum or revolutionary consensus. While some arguments acknowledged the idiosyncratic volatility of the moment, no evidence suggests imminent collapse of the caretaker regime or elite plans to elevate Lamichhane. There remains near unanimity among specialists across disciplines that the status quo will hold, with only a remote black swan path for Lamichhane. Therefore, I maintain my 5% estimate, reflecting a minimal but nonzero possibility, and see no justification to revise it upward or downward based on the deliberation.",

The piece evaluates each candidate\u2019s strengths and risks. Balen Shah is described as an \"untainted outsider\" who mobilises youth but lacks broader governance experience and may alienate elites. Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is portrayed as a \"stable, moderate, and consensus\u2011oriented\" figure with strong business and diplomatic ties, though he has limited mass appeal. Rabi Lamichhane is noted for mass appeal and anti\u2011corruption rhetoric but faces legal controversies and credibility questions. The article concludes that Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is the most internationally palatable candidate for an interim prime minister, offering a balanced, neighbour\u2011friendly statesmanship.

According to the piece, at least 72 people were killed and 2\u202f000 injured, and preliminary estimates put the damage at 2\u202fto\u202f20\u202fbillion euros.  The protests destroyed key state buildings \u2013 the Parliament, the Supreme Court, ministries, police stations, hotels and the headquarters of *The Kathmandu Post* \u2013 and set fire to the historic Singha\u202fDurbar complex.  A Ministry of Health employee lamented, \u2018I understand that the youth want change, but it is a mess, all the archives go up in smoke,\u2019 while a transport ministry official said, \u2018Do not confuse politicians with the buildings that serve the people.\u2019  The unrest was inspired by earlier youth\u2011led movements in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri\u202fLanka, and the article notes that the youth of Nepal, often called \u2018Nepo\u2011kids,\u2019 used TikTok and Discord to organize.  After the army imposed a curfew, the youth elected former Supreme Court chief Sushila\u202fKarki as prime minister via a Discord vote, a move described as \u2018the first government head elected on Discord.\u2019  The article quotes economist Raghu\u202fBir\u202fBista: \u2018Beyond the amounts, Generation\u202fZ burned symbols.

Karki, 73, who was appointed on September\u202f12, took office following an agreement with leaders of the largely youth\u2011led \u2018Gen\u202fZ\u2019 protest movement.  The military, which enforced a curfew during the unrest, ultimately consented to her leadership of a caretaker government charged with overseeing elections within six months.

Former chief justice Sushila Karki, 73, was sworn in as interim prime minister on September 13, 2025, becoming the country\u2019s first female leader. Her appointment followed the resignation of KP Sharma Oli and the dissolution of parliament, with new elections slated for March 2026. Protesters had stormed Kathmandu, torching the Supreme Court, the Attorney General\u2019s office, the Prime Minister\u2019s residence and Parliament; security forces reported that more than 12,500 prisoners escaped from jails amid the chaos. Karki\u2019s emergence was the result of negotiations involving army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel, President Ram Chandra Paudel and youth activists on Discord. Suraj Bhattarai, a social worker, said 'We believe she will push forward the fight against corruption and promote good governance.' The article notes that the unrest was sparked by corruption, economic hardship and a controversial social media ban, and that the government\u2019s decision was aimed at curbing fake news and hate speech, though protesters viewed it as a crackdown on free expression.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 09:41 AM\nSource:[icirnigeria.org](https://www.icirnigeria.org/nepal-calm-as-first-female-prime-minister-takes-charge-after-deadly-protests/)\n\n**When will Nepal get new PM?

The post of prime minister has been vacant since KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday. Four names have emerged as potential candidates: Kathmandu mayor and rapper Balendra Shah 'Balen', former chief justice Sushila Karki, former chief of the electricity board Kulman Ghising, and current mayor of Dharan Harka Raj Sampang Rai. The scuffle on Thursday evening involved supporters of Balen, Karki or Sampang, according to multiple outlets. No final decision has yet been reached; talks are ongoing among Gen\u2011Z representatives, President Ram Chandra Paudel and the army chief. The President issued an appeal for calm and said he was doing his best to find a solution, with a letter seen as a signal to Gen\u2011Z representatives to 'take the onus and decide'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 11:19 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-nepal-get-new-leader-wait-extends-gen-z-cracks-what-we-know-so-far-101757588087511.html)\n\n**'Gen Z' protests: What's next for Nepal?**\nThousands of demonstrators in Nepal marched to demand the lifting of a social\u2011media ban that sparked a wave of anti\u2011corruption protests and led to the resignation of the prime minister on Tuesday. The protests, which have already claimed at least 19 lives, are dominated by Generation\u202fZ (born 1997\u20112012) and lack a single leader. The army has called for talks, but it is unclear whom the government can negotiate with. Constitutional expert Balaram\u202fKC said, 'Gen\u202fZ should set up a negotiation team,' and added that the president should then hold talks with that team, civil\u2011society members and the army. Under Nepal\u2019s 2015 constitution a successor must be chosen from the party with a parliamentary majority; if none exists the president appoints a candidate who can secure a majority and must win a confidence vote within 30\u202fdays. If that fails, the house may be dissolved and elections held. Experts such as Bipin\u202fAdhikari propose a temporary interim government that could pursue the reforms demanded by Gen\u202fZ and hold elections within six months. Potential leaders favored by the youth include Balendra\u202fShah, the 35\u2011year\u2011old mayor of Kathmandu elected in 2022, and Rabi\u202fLamichhane, a former TV journalist who founded the Rastriya\u202fSwatantra\u202fParty in 2022 and was reportedly freed from prison by protesters.

Gen\u2011Z groups, notably Hami Nepal, held an hours\u2011long online discussion on Discord and voted to endorse former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as caretaker prime minister.  The Army chief, Ashokraj\u202fSigdel, was informed of the choice, while other Gen\u2011Z\u2011style groups\u2014including royalists and those who allegedly infiltrated the Monday\u2011night rally that killed 20 people\u2014were invited to meet at the army headquarters on Thursday.  Former National Human Rights Commissioner Mohna\u202fAnsari wrote on social media that \u201cFormer Chief Justice Sushila Karki is the best option to address the adverse circumstances prevailing in the nation\u201d and urged the President to act transparently.  The Constitution\u2019s Article\u202f273 allows the President to declare a state of emergency, which must be endorsed by a two\u2011thirds majority of Parliament within a month and would then last three months.  Analysts such as Krishna\u202fKhanal argue that a middle\u2011ground solution is needed, noting that the 2015 Constitution was the product of nearly a decade of negotiation and that a new charter could destabilise the country.  The article cites that 30 people died during the violent protests on Monday and Tuesday, and that 12 Gen\u2011Z\u2011style groups were involved in the discussions.  It also lists potential caretaker candidates\u2014Balen\u202fShah, Kulman\u202fGhising, Sumana\u202fShrestha\u2014and notes that Rabi\u202fLamichhane was released from jail on Tuesday after eight months of incarceration for embezzlement.

It identifies three main candidates: Balen Shah, Mayor of Kathmandu; Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar, a senior businessman and media founder; and Rabi Lamichhane, a media personality and party leader. The piece evaluates each candidate\u2019s strengths and risks. Balen Shah is described as an \"untainted outsider\" who mobilises youth but lacks broader governance experience and may alienate elites. Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is portrayed as a \"stable, moderate, and consensus\u2011oriented\" figure with strong business and diplomatic ties, though he has limited mass appeal. Rabi Lamichhane is noted for mass appeal and anti\u2011corruption rhetoric but faces legal controversies and credibility questions. The article concludes that Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is the most internationally palatable candidate for an interim prime minister, offering a balanced, neighbour\u2011friendly statesmanship.

Demonstrators set fire to the Parliament, the President's Office, the PM's residence, the Supreme Court, political party offices and homes of senior leaders. At least 19 people were killed in Monday's protests by Gen Z over corruption and a government ban on social media, which was lifted Monday night. A mob set a house belonging to former prime minister Jhala Nath Khanal on fire in Dallu; his wife Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar sustained serious burn injuries and later died at Kirtipur Burn Hospital. The Supreme Court building, Singhdurbar, the President's Office at Maharajgunj and the PM's residence at Baluwatar were also set ablaze. The Kantipur Television office in Tinkune, as well as police posts at Gaushala, Lubhu and Kalimati, were vandalised and set on fire. The house of former prime minister and Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba in Budhanilkantha was also torched. Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balen Shah urged calm and called for talks with the Army chief, but insisted Parliament must be dissolved first.

The protests were sparked by a ban on 26 social media apps, including Instagram, Facebook and X. The violence also saw the burning of Oli\u2019s home in Bhaktapur and stone\u2011throwing at the residences of Deputy Prime Minister Bishnu Paudel and Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Biswo Paudel. In the same week, 21 MPs from Rabi Lamichhane\u2019s Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) resigned, heightening the political crisis. Lamichhane, a former home minister and media personality, is seen as a potential successor, but his ability to lead depends on his release from jail. Another possible contender is Balendra \u201cBalen\u201d Shah, the independent Mayor of Kathmandu, who has publicly supported the Gen\u2011Z protests and urged that the movement remain non\u2011partisan.

    "summary": "Across seven forecasting experts specializing in various aspects of Nepali and South Asian politics, there is a clear consensus that Rabi Lamichhane\u2019s chances of becoming the next non-caretaker prime minister of Nepal before January 1, 2026, are low, though not outright impossible. Most experts assign Lamichhane a probability of 24%, except for two who give much lower odds (8% and 5%), reflecting particularly strong skepticism due to procedural and legal hurdles. \n\nKey reasons for the low probability include Lamichhane\u2019s recent incarceration on embezzlement or fraud charges, unresolved legal issues, the fragmentation and weakened state of his party (with significant MP defections), and a caretaker government led by Sushila Karki whose mandate and elite/foreign backing prioritize stability and elections over sudden leadership changes. All experts cite the entrenched interests of major parties, the Nepali army, and international stakeholders, who are currently invested in consensus and technocratic transition rather than outsider, controversial figures.\n\nOn the other hand, Lamichhane has considerable anti-establishment and Gen-Z protest support, and all experts recognize a nonzero chance for a dramatic scenario in which further crisis, collapse of interim government, or unprecedented unification of street and parliamentary forces could elevate a populist or anti-corruption figure like Lamichhane. Nonetheless, base rates and comparative regional history indicate such figures almost never ascend so rapidly in the wake of major legal trouble and institutional opposition\u2014instead, consensus or caretaker figures are almost always preferred during transitional periods.\n\nIn summary, unless there is an extremely unlikely further breakdown producing a revolutionary coalition and legal clearance for Lamichhane, the current and likely outcome is that he will *not* be the next non-caretaker prime minister before the forecast window closes.",
