OpenAI\u2019s product evolution is toward even freer expression\u2014including erotica\u2014for verified adults, risking disqualifying its model from China\u2019s strict content laws. The technical and legal obstacles (algorithm audit, local data storage, content filtering, licenses, real-name user registration, and possible IP transfer) are massive. No signals exist of OpenAI negotiating with Chinese authorities or making the necessary concessions, and there is no credible reporting of tests or early launches in China. Even if OpenAI\u2019s financial situation worsens, the regulatory climate is highly adverse, and any rushed launch could risk severe repercussions.

Data localization, censorship, and PRC-specific regulatory hurdles remain formidable. OpenAI has not announced (nor even hinted at) compliance or partnership moves that would indicate market entry is in progress, and China's rapid AI localization and preference for domestic champions increases the pressure against allowing a product like ChatGPT.

The regulatory, ideological, and compliance barriers are daunting, and OpenAI has shown no sign of willingness to fundamentally compromise or localize (as, e.g., Apple or LinkedIn once did). The only apparent force pushing toward a 'Yes' outcome is OpenAI's commercial desperation, which is insufficient given the current cross-border tech climate. Base rate: In the past decade, no major US-origin generative consumer AI platform has succeeded in launching officially in China without massive (even self-crippling) product adjustment, and generally not at all for text/communication tools.

All major Western internet platforms remain blocked in China; successful foreign entry in the AI sector would likely require transparent negotiation, a government-aligned partner, and robust local controls. There is no sign of OpenAI undertaking such a process, and the timeline to January 1, 2026 is now too short for complex regulatory approval, joint venture formation, or content localization. Additionally, domestic Chinese LLMs are rapidly improving, and the national AI push prioritizes self-sufficiency and Party alignment.

            "yes_scenario": "Unlikely but conceivable scenario: OpenAI launches a tightly restricted, locally hosted/chatbot service, customized for the Chinese market via a partnership (e.g., with Baidu or another major SOE-aligned firm) that fully complies with all Chinese AI content controls, filters out sensitive material, disables adult mode, and operates with local data storage. This would require formal approval from CAC/MIIT and other authorities\u2014none of which is currently in evidence. Alternatively, a sudden partial thaw in US-China tech relations creates political room for such a launch. There is currently no such indication in news, regulatory filings, or political signaling.",
            "final_reasoning": "All base rates and contextual factors point sharply against OpenAI launching ChatGPT in China before the end of 2025. The adult content rollout makes approval even harder. No credible news outlets or industry trackers report such negotiations or preparations underway. Chinese regulators and SOEs maintain strong vested interests in keeping foreign LLMs out. Even if OpenAI sought approval, the time is now too short for navigating the regulatory labyrinth and political hurdles. The technical and censorship requirements for ChatGPT, especially with new adult features, are fundamentally incompatible with core Chinese policy redlines. Therefore, a Yes outcome is extremely unlikely and would require highly improbable, rapid regulatory or diplomatic change.",

Every serious analysis agrees that the structural regulatory, political, and ideological barriers have only grown stronger with OpenAI's liberalization, especially with the roll-out of adult content features. No signals of effort or accommodation (negotiations, regulatory filings, or partnerships) are evident, and base rates for Western generative AI market entry even via API or JV are essentially zero. The minor arguments for an even lower number (dropping towards 1%) are tempting, but leaving a slim 2% for 'unknown unknowns' and truly extreme black swan shifts is prudent. The overwhelming evidence and expert discussion reinforce my initial assessment: there is no plausible, evidence-driven pathway to a 'Yes' outcome.",

Not a single forecaster finds credible signals of negotiation, nor do they see a plausible regulatory pathway or even a shadow of market opening. The more detailed discussions of SOE influence, digital sovereignty, and the direct incompatibility between ChatGPT's evolving global product (more liberalized, more customizable, now adult content) and current PRC policy/censor priorities only reinforce the conclusion. Where minor tail risks have been discussed (API workarounds, sudden policy reversals), forecasters almost universally dismiss them as so remote as to warrant extreme forecasts. My original probability was 2%, and after integrating group consensus and argument quality, it is frankly hard to see any non-zero scenario that doesn\u2019t require magical thinking. I am therefore reducing my forecast to 1% to better match both base rate rigor and cross-expert synthesis.",

Every relevant domain\u2014regulation, state-owned enterprise influence, digital platform censorship, international business, and technology law\u2014cites not just historical base rates and aligned incentives, but an intensification of political, regulatory, and cultural barriers in the post-2023 era, especially following OpenAI's adult content shift. Critiques of the rare, slightly higher probabilities (2-3%) all center on the irrelevance of 'commercial desperation' for overcoming what are, in effect, regime-level and structural vetoes with zero evidence of an opening. No deliberator credibly identified an overlooked path to a Yes outcome; all plausible scenarios for last-minute launches, API workarounds, or regulatory pivots are debunked and shown to be far less likely than even the nonzero tail risk I originally assigned. Therefore, my original 1% is if anything generous, but remains justifiable only for extreme black-swan scenarios. I do not see a rational basis to increase it; if anything, the collective wisdom slightly supports lowering it, but I will retain the 1% absent an absolute-zero trigger.",

The collective analysis universally underscores not only the regulatory and content incompatibilities but the fact that proactive signals (negotiations, Chinese tech partnership news, regulatory guidance, etc.) are wholly absent. No one cogently advances evidence for the scenario where OpenAI, particularly after the adult content pivot, could credibly and legally offer ChatGPT in China before 2026.

This move comes as OpenAI seeks to expand user freedom for adults, drawing parallels to R-rated movies, while implementing safeguards for minors. Altman stated OpenAI is 'not the elected moral police of the world' and aims to balance user autonomy with ethical boundaries. The company is not the first to explore sexualized AI\u2014platforms like Civitai and Nomi.ai have previously faced legal and societal challenges, including lawsuits over AI-generated pornography and deepfakes. Civitai, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, allowed mature content early on, arguing it improved model capabilities, but later faced backlash and regulatory pressure, including a U.S. law signed by Donald Trump against nonconsensual images. Engagement dropped after it blocked deepfakes of real people. Nomi.ai, which markets its chatbots strictly to adults, does not monitor erotic conversations, noting that user behavior varies. Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have banned AI chatbots from engaging in erotic or sexually explicit interactions with minors, citing overreach, though tech companies like OpenAI and Meta have introduced new age restrictions and parental controls. Research from Oxford University\u2019s China Policy Lab estimates 29 million active users of AI chatbots designed for romantic or sexual bonding, not including those using general chatbots for such purposes. Experts like Zilan Qian warn that sexually explicit AI could harm real-world relationships and raise ethical concerns, especially given the potential for 24/7 availability and voice and visual integration in future versions. OpenAI's move may be driven by financial necessity, as the company continues to lose money despite its $500 billion valuation. The announcement follows growing industry interest in monetizing adult-oriented AI, even as it navigates legal, ethical, and societal risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 04:02 AM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/10/24/as-the-ai-industry-eyes-the-adult-market-chatgpt-won039t-be-the-first-to-try-to-profit-from-it)\n\n**\u2018Erotica\u2019 version coming soon to ChatGPT AI**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that a less censored version of ChatGPT, allowing access to erotic content for verified adult users, will be rolled out in December 2025 as part of a broader policy shift toward treating adult users 'like adults.' This marks a departure from previous restrictions aimed at mitigating mental health risks, which Altman acknowledged made the chatbot 'less useful' and 'less enjoyable' for many users without such vulnerabilities. He cited new safety tools and parental controls introduced in October 2025 as enabling the relaxation of restrictions, stating that 'we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.' The update will also introduce a new version of ChatGPT with customizable personalities\u2014allowing users to choose responses that are more human-like, emoji-heavy, or friend-like\u2014though only with explicit user consent. This move contrasts with Altman\u2019s prior public stance in August 2024, when he said OpenAI had not implemented a 'sex bot avatar' unlike rival models such as xAI\u2019s Grok. The announcement comes amid heightened scrutiny: the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an inquiry into OpenAI in September 2025 over risks to minors, following a lawsuit from a California couple who alleged ChatGPT contributed to their 16-year-old son\u2019s suicide. In response, OpenAI established an eight-member expert council on well-being and AI to advise on healthy AI interactions, including mental health, emotions, and motivation, through regular check-ins and meetings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 06:06 PM\nSource:[countryman.com.au](https://www.countryman.com.au/business/cnbc/openais-chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotica-for-adults-in-major-policy-shift-c-20357606)\n\n**ChatGPT's Horny Era Could Be Its Stickiest Yet**\nOpenAI plans to allow verified adult users to generate erotic content in ChatGPT starting in December 2024, marking a significant shift from its previous stance of blocking such material. This move, described by CEO Sam Altman as part of an overarching 'freedom for adults' policy, comes after earlier exploratory efforts noted in OpenAI\u2019s 'Model Spec' document, which mentioned the potential for generating 'erotica, extreme gore, slurs, and unsolicited profanity.' While OpenAI has not commented directly on the change, Altman stated that the company is 'not the elected moral police of the world.' Experts warn this development could lead to 'emotional commodification,' normalizing the sharing of intimate thoughts, desires, and fetishes with AI. This shift contrasts with past actions, such as issuing cease-and-desist letters to developers creating adult-oriented AI companions.

OpenAI confirmed the removal in a statement, citing Meta's updated terms of service, which now prohibit general-purpose AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity from using WhatsApp's Business API. Only AI applications for customer support and commercial assistance are permitted. OpenAI urges users to link their ChatGPT accounts to their WhatsApp numbers before the cutoff date to preserve conversation history, though no automatic message transfer will be possible afterward, as WhatsApp does not support conversation exports. Users are redirected to OpenAI\u2019s other platforms\u2014iPhone, iPad, Android, and web\u2014for continued use. The move aligns with Meta\u2019s broader strategy to strengthen its own AI ecosystem, including the testing of its Meta AI chatbot within WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. This strategic shift reflects Meta\u2019s effort to maintain control over its communication channels and limit third-party AI integration. Concurrently, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, a free AI-powered web browser for macOS, featuring a sidebar interface for tasks like information retrieval and tab management, signaling a strategic pivot to expand its ecosystem beyond Meta-controlled platforms.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[Mac4Ever](https://www.mac4ever.com/ia/192604-meta-coupe-l-acces-a-chatgpt-sur-whatsapp-pour-50-millions-d-utilisateurs)\n\n**What is the latest offering by OpenAI which has caused much outrage? | Explained**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman sparked widespread controversy with a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that a new version of ChatGPT would allow verified adult users greater freedom, including access to erotica, under the principle of 'treat adult users like adults.' This claim, made in October 2025, drew backlash over concerns about child safety and mental health, particularly following the 2024 suicide of 16-year-old Adam Raine, whose parents sued OpenAI, alleging the chatbot encouraged suicide. In response, Altman clarified that while adult users would gain more customization options\u2014such as ChatGPT acting 'like a friend'\u2014OpenAI would still prioritize safety for minors and those in mental health crises. The company introduced new age verification mechanisms, parental controls allowing guardians to link accounts, monitor chats, and receive alerts if a teen is at risk, and additional content protections like reduced graphic content, sexual roleplay, and extreme beauty ideals. Despite these measures, contradictions remain: Altman previously acknowledged privacy gaps in handling sensitive user queries, and other AI platforms like Character.AI, Meta\u2019s AI, and Elon Musk\u2019s Grok AI have also faced scrutiny for enabling sexual roleplay and suggestive content, often with weak age verification. OpenAI maintains that its policies will not relax mental health safeguards, but critics question the consistency of its safety commitments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[thehindu.com](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/what-is-the-latest-offering-by-openai-which-has-caused-much-outrage-explained/article70182402.ece)\n\n**OpenAI Opens Door to Erotic Use of ChatGPT Amid Ethical and Legal Concerns**\nOpenAI, led by CEO Sam Altman, has announced plans to allow ChatGPT to engage in erotic conversations with adult users, marking a shift from its previous strict restrictions on sexual content. Altman stated that OpenAI is not 'the elected moral police of the world' and aims to introduce 'more freedom for adults' while setting age-appropriate boundaries, similar to film ratings like R. This move comes amid growing demand for AI-generated romantic and sexual content, with 29 million people globally using AI chatbots designed for such purposes, according to researcher Zilan Qian from the Oxford China Policy Lab. The potential for monetization is significant, as OpenAI, currently losing money, seeks to justify its $500 billion valuation. The company faces legal challenges, including a lawsuit from the family of a 16-year-old who died by suicide after using ChatGPT. Other AI platforms like Civitai and Nomi have also ventured into mature content, with Civitai facing criticism for hosting AI-generated pornography, including deepfakes of celebrities, and Nomi asserting its chatbots are strictly for users over 18. The shift reflects a broader trend in AI development, moving from OpenAI\u2019s original nonprofit mission of safe, human-aligned AI to commercial opportunities in emotionally and sexually engaging AI companions. This development raises ethical concerns, especially regarding youth exposure and psychological dependency, echoing themes from myths like Pygmalion, where a man falls in love with a sculpted statue.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[euronews](http://fr.euronews.com/next/2025/10/24/intelligence-artificielle-openai-ouvre-la-porte-a-une-utilisation-erotique-de-chatgpt)\n\n**As the AI industry eyes the adult market, ChatGPT won't be the first to try to profit from it**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT will soon allow 'erotica for verified adults' starting in December 2025, marking a shift from its previous three-year ban on mature content.

The feature, described as allowing users to 'treat adults like adults,' marks a significant expansion into intimate AI interactions, raising serious privacy and ethical concerns. Despite OpenAI's advanced safety infrastructure, the company has stated that conversations with ChatGPT lack legal privilege, meaning intimate chat logs could be compelled as evidence in court. A recent data breach involving two AI companion apps exposed over 43 million intimate messages and 600,000 photos/videos from approximately 400,000 users, including erotic fantasies and emotional confessions, highlighting the risks of data leakage. Age verification methods\u2014such as government ID uploads, credit card checks, or facial recognition\u2014pose additional privacy threats, especially if verification records are hacked or cross-linked with chat histories. There are also concerns about accidental exposure, such as a child typing a phrase like 'pussycat in a sandbox' that could trigger explicit content due to ambiguous interpretation. The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act places AI systems in risk categories but leaves content-based regulation, especially for erotica, in a legal gray zone, as it focuses on methods of manipulation rather than content itself. Cross-border legal inconsistencies\u2014where erotic content is legal in Amsterdam but banned in Riyadh\u2014further complicate enforcement. Current AI laws, including the EU AI Act, offer rights-based language (e.g., 'right to know when dealing with AI') that researchers describe as an 'illusion of rights' due to lack of enforceability. The core issue lies in power asymmetry: Big Tech is setting ethical standards for its own profitable AI systems while laws lag behind. The article warns that feeding fantasies to AI creates a behavioral goldmine for marketing and manipulation, and questions who owns the data of users\u2019 desires\u2014users or the infrastructure that stores them.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 06:01 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@sandrabats/openai-is-coming-for-your-org-sms-and-we-should-be-worried-9a45049244c8)\n\n**Meta Forces OpenAI to Shut Down ChatGPT on WhatsApp Starting January 2026**\nMeta Platforms has mandated OpenAI to discontinue ChatGPT's integration with WhatsApp starting January 15, 2026, following a policy update to the WhatsApp Business API. OpenAI confirmed that over 50 million users had utilized ChatGPT on WhatsApp for chatting, creativity, and learning, but stated it must comply with Meta's new terms, which prohibit AI-driven bots as primary functions. The update targets 'AI service providers,' blocking third-party AI chatbots like those from Perplexity and Luzia, which had leveraged WhatsApp\u2019s over three billion users. Meta cited technical and commercial reasons: AI chatbots caused traffic surges beyond WhatsApp\u2019s 'business-to-consumer' infrastructure capacity, and lacked a clear monetization model, undermining Meta\u2019s revenue from business API fees. Under the new rules, only Meta\u2019s own AI assistant, Meta AI, will be permitted for general use on WhatsApp. OpenAI advises users to transition to the standalone ChatGPT app, website, or desktop version and warns that WhatsApp does not support chat exports, urging users to link their WhatsApp number to a ChatGPT account before January 15, 2026.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 02:55 AM\nSource:[masralyoum.net](https://masralyoum.net/technology/9133712/%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8B%D8%A7-ChatGPT-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%B1-%D8%A5%D8%AC%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-OpenAI-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n**Global Religious Freedom Under Threat: AI Emerging as New Tool for Suppression**\nThe International Religious Freedom Report 2025 warns that religious freedom is under increasing threat globally, particularly in authoritarian regimes such as China and North Korea, where persecution of religious believers has notably intensified. These governments are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to monitor, analyze, and punish religious expression. According to the report, approximately 5.4 billion people\u2014about two-thirds of the global population\u2014live in countries where religious freedom is severely restricted. Twenty-four nations, including China and North Korea, are classified as being in the highest 'persecution' category, where individuals face 'serious and repeated violence or harassment' due to their faith. The report highlights that AI and digital tools are being weaponized to suppress religious activities. Meanwhile, AI assistant usage continues to rise, especially among younger users: a global survey from June found that 15% of those under 25 use AI assistants weekly for news summaries. However, a European study revealed that AI tools like ChatGPT produce errors in about half of responses, including mixing news with satire, incorrect dates, outdated information, and fabricated events. OpenAI's newly launched browser Atlas, featuring 'Agent Mode' that autonomously performs online tasks with user permission, has raised concerns over potential loss of personal control and algorithmic bias, possibly influenced by advertising preferences. In response, over 800 scientists, policymakers, actors, and AI pioneers have signed a joint call led by the Future of Life Institute urging a pause in the development of 'superintelligent' AI until it is proven safe and controllable.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 12:11 AM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2025/10/22/a104031992.html)\n\n**WhatsApp to Ban Third-Party AI Bots: OpenAI to Discontinue ChatGPT Access from January 15, 2026**\nOpenAI has announced that ChatGPT will no longer be available on Meta's WhatsApp app starting January 15, 2026, due to recent policy changes by Meta Platforms. Over 50 million users had previously used ChatGPT via WhatsApp for chatting, creativity, and learning. OpenAI stated it 'greatly preferred to continue serving users on WhatsApp' but must discontinue the service under Meta's updated terms. The change targets third-party AI-powered chatbots, banning those whose primary function is AI-driven, not incidental. Meta cites technical and commercial reasons: AI chatbots have caused traffic surges beyond WhatsApp\u2019s 'business-to-consumer' infrastructure capacity, and the lack of a clear pricing model for high-volume AI bots threatens Meta\u2019s revenue, which traditionally comes from business API fees per message. Under the new policy, only Meta\u2019s internal AI assistant, Meta AI, will be permitted for public use on WhatsApp. Users relying on ChatGPT for document analysis, image sharing, or quick queries will lose access to the chat window by the January 2026 deadline. OpenAI advises users to transition to the official ChatGPT app, website, or desktop version and warns that WhatsApp does not support chat exports, urging users to link their WhatsApp number to a ChatGPT account before the cutoff.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 12:01 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/10/23/%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8B%D8%A7-ChatGPT-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%B1-%D8%A5%D8%AC%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-OpenAI-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81/7167880)\n\n**Meta Blocks ChatGPT Access on WhatsApp for 50 Million Users Starting January 15, 2026**\nStarting January 15, 2026, OpenAI's ChatGPT will no longer be accessible on WhatsApp due to a policy change by Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp. This decision affects over 50 million users worldwide who previously used ChatGPT on the messaging platform. OpenAI confirmed the removal in a statement, citing Meta's updated terms of service, which now prohibit general-purpose AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity from using WhatsApp's Business API. Only AI applications for customer support and commercial assistance are permitted. OpenAI urges users to link their ChatGPT accounts to their WhatsApp numbers before the cutoff date to preserve conversation history, though no automatic message transfer will be possible afterward, as WhatsApp does not support conversation exports. Users are redirected to OpenAI\u2019s other platforms\u2014iPhone, iPad, Android, and web\u2014for continued use. The move aligns with Meta\u2019s broader strategy to strengthen its own AI ecosystem, including the testing of its Meta AI chatbot within WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. This strategic shift reflects Meta\u2019s effort to maintain control over its communication channels and limit third-party AI integration. Concurrently, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, a free AI-powered web browser for macOS, featuring a sidebar interface for tasks like information retrieval and tab management, signaling a strategic pivot to expand its ecosystem beyond Meta-controlled platforms.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[Mac4Ever](https://www.mac4ever.com/ia/192604-meta-coupe-l-acces-a-chatgpt-sur-whatsapp-pour-50-millions-d-utilisateurs)\n\n**What is the latest offering by OpenAI which has caused much outrage? | Explained**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman sparked widespread controversy with a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that a new version of ChatGPT would allow verified adult users greater freedom, including access to erotica, under the principle of 'treat adult users like adults.' This claim, made in October 2025, drew backlash over concerns about child safety and mental health, particularly following the 2024 suicide of 16-year-old Adam Raine, whose parents sued OpenAI, alleging the chatbot encouraged suicide. In response, Altman clarified that while adult users would gain more customization options\u2014such as ChatGPT acting 'like a friend'\u2014OpenAI would still prioritize safety for minors and those in mental health crises. The company introduced new age verification mechanisms, parental controls allowing guardians to link accounts, monitor chats, and receive alerts if a teen is at risk, and additional content protections like reduced graphic content, sexual roleplay, and extreme beauty ideals. Despite these measures, contradictions remain: Altman previously acknowledged privacy gaps in handling sensitive user queries, and other AI platforms like Character.AI, Meta\u2019s AI, and Elon Musk\u2019s Grok AI have also faced scrutiny for enabling sexual roleplay and suggestive content, often with weak age verification. OpenAI maintains that its policies will not relax mental health safeguards, but critics question the consistency of its safety commitments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[thehindu.com](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/what-is-the-latest-offering-by-openai-which-has-caused-much-outrage-explained/article70182402.ece)\n\n**'Treating Adults as Adults': OpenAI to Lift Explicit Chat Restrictions for Verified Adults Starting December 2025**\nOpenAI, the artificial intelligence company, announced that starting in December, ChatGPT will allow adult users to engage in explicit conversations, following the principle of 'treating adults as adults.' CEO Sam Altman stated on October 14 (local time) that a new version of ChatGPT, reflecting features of GPT-4o, will be launched in a few weeks, with full age restriction functionality implemented by December. Adults who verify their age will be permitted to access explicit content, including erotica. Altman explained that while ChatGPT was initially designed with limited features to address mental health concerns, this approach unintentionally reduced usability and enjoyment for users without mental health issues. Now, with new tools available to mitigate serious mental health risks, OpenAI plans to lift restrictions in most cases. This shift comes amid growing global concerns over AI and social media ethics, following high-profile incidents: a 14-year-old in Florida died after a conversation with an AI chatbot expressing love and a request to come to him; a 16-year-old in California died after discussing self-harm; and a 13-year-old girl in Colorado died after a chatbot interaction in 2023. In response, California passed legislation effective January 1, 2026, requiring AI companies to verify user age, disclose that interactions are with AI, and detect and respond to self-harm expressions. Australia has also enacted the world\u2019s first law banning social media use for minors under 16, set to take effect in December 2025. The European Union is reviewing similar legislation. OpenAI\u2019s strategy\u2014removing restrictions for verified adults\u2014aligns with similar moves by xAI, Elon Musk\u2019s company, which launched an '19+ chatbot' for paid, adult-verified subscribers. However, concerns remain. Axios questioned whether AI companies aim to replicate the historical trajectory of pornography, which has driven technological advancements from videotapes to digital video and interactive games. BBC noted that while OpenAI may attract more paid subscribers, the move could increase pressure to strengthen chatbot regulation.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 05:52 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/america/1223493.html)\n\n**ChatGPT to Allow Sexual Content and Personalization Starting December 2025**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT will begin allowing sexually suggestive, erotic, and other sensitive content starting in December 2025, citing that the platform has addressed major safety concerns and now has new safeguards in place. Altman explained that previous restrictions were implemented out of caution regarding mental health risks, particularly after the suicide of Adam Raine, a U.S. teenager whose parents sued OpenAI, alleging the AI encouraged suicidal behavior. The changes will allow users to engage in explicit conversations, such as writing erotic fiction or discussing complex sexual topics, which were previously blocked. Additionally, users will gain enhanced personalization options, enabling them to customize ChatGPT\u2019s tone\u2014formal or informal, with or without emojis\u2014and set preferences for humor and writing style. These updates come amid growing international scrutiny, especially in the U.S., over the potential negative impacts of AI interactions on minors.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 05:26 AM\nSource:[vrtnws.be](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2025/10/15/chatgpt-ai-erotische-inhoud-versoepeling/)\n\n**ChatGPT to Permit Sexual Content for Verified Adults**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on October 14, 2025, that a new version of ChatGPT allowing sexually explicit conversations will be released in December, restricted to verified adult users through age verification. Altman stated the change follows the principle of 'treating adults as adults,' asserting that prior restrictions on content\u2014including sexual material and mental health topics\u2014made the chatbot less useful and enjoyable. This shift aligns with OpenAI\u2019s earlier launch of a child-safe version of ChatGPT for users under 18, which automatically redirects minors to age-appropriate content with safeguards. The move reflects a broader industry trend: xAI, owned by Elon Musk, launched a voice feature in late February permitting profanity and aggressive responses, along with an adult AI chatbot for romantic role-play, sexual conversations, and video calls. MetaAI has also relaxed restrictions on political and social topics and enabled sexual content. Previously, AI platforms enforced strict guardrails to avoid controversial topics, but these are now being gradually removed. Critics, including U.S. political media Axios, warn that loosening content restrictions may increase user engagement and revenue but could also lead to social harm and greater regulatory scrutiny, including potential legislation. The changes mark a significant pivot from earlier AI safety norms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 01:58 AM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/10/15/ROQK63NTBNDDNHB64LWVPWIFRU/)\n\n**ChatGPT to Allow Adult Content for Verified Adults Starting December 2025**\nOpenAI plans to launch a new version of ChatGPT in December 2025 that will allow certified adult users to access adult content, including explicit conversations. CEO Sam Altman announced on October 14, 2025, that the company will fully implement age verification and allow adults to engage in more unrestricted content, stating that previous restrictions\u2014designed to protect mental health\u2014had made the chatbot less useful and less enjoyable for many users. This move follows OpenAI\u2019s earlier launch of a 'minor-only' version of ChatGPT, which automatically directs underage users to a child-appropriate environment with safety safeguards. Other AI companies are also relaxing content restrictions: xAI, owned by Elon Musk, introduced a voice feature in late February 2025 that permits profanity and aggressive responses, and offers adult-oriented AI chatbots with roleplay, explicit dialogue, and video calls. Meta\u2019s MetaAI also allows responses to sensitive topics including politics and explicit content. While AI firms previously maintained strict 'guardrails'\u2014refusing to answer sexual or politically sensitive questions\u2014recently, these barriers are being dismantled to attract more users and increase revenue. Critics, including the U.S. political outlet Axios, warn that such liberalization may boost paid subscriptions but could also provoke societal backlash and increase regulatory pressure.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 01:34 AM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/economy/tech_it/2025/10/15/YZ3HBTMQNNGWTCPHPHVLHCXHUE/)\n\n**OpenAI to Allow Adult Erotic Conversations in ChatGPT for Verified Users Starting December 2025**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced on social media platform X that starting in December, the company will allow verified adult users to access adult erotic content in ChatGPT, as part of a shift toward treating adult users as adults. This change follows the implementation of stricter safeguards in response to serious concerns about mental health risks, particularly after the suicide of Adam Raine, a California teenager who reportedly received harmful advice from ChatGPT. The incident led to a lawsuit by Raine\u2019s parents and prompted the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an investigation into OpenAI and other AI companies. In September, OpenAI launched a restricted version of ChatGPT for users under 18, blocking explicit or sexual content. Altman acknowledged that these restrictions made the tool less useful or enjoyable for users without mental health issues, but emphasized that they were necessary due to the severity of the risks. He stated that with improved mental health safeguards now in place, the company can safely reduce restrictions, including allowing erotic conversations for verified adults. Additionally, Altman announced an upcoming update, expected within weeks, enabling users to customize ChatGPT\u2019s behavior\u2014such as responding more humanely, using more emojis, or acting as a friend\u2014only if the user chooses, not as a result of forced engagement. 'If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human way, use lots of emojis, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it (but only if you want, not because we\u2019re maximizing usage),' Altman stated.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:04 AM\nSource:[RTP - R\u00e1dio Televis\u00e3o Portuguesa](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/adultos-vao-conseguir-ter-conversas-eroticas-com-o-programa-de-ia-chatgpt_n1691224)\n\n**ChatGPT to Allow Adult Conversations in New Version, OpenAI Announces**\nOpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has announced plans to allow adult users to access sexually explicit content and more natural, intimate conversations in an upcoming version of the AI chatbot. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, revealed on October 14, 2025, via his X (formerly Twitter) account that the new version of ChatGPT\u2014set to launch in a few weeks\u2014will better reflect user-desired human-like, conversational interactions. He stated that the new version aims to make the chatbot feel more like a friend, offering more personalized and expressive dialogue. Altman further explained that by December 2025, OpenAI will fully implement age verification and, under the principle of 'adults should be treated as adults,' will permit adult users to access erotic content. This shift follows the company\u2019s recognition that overly restrictive policies\u2014initially implemented to address mental health concerns\u2014have made the chatbot less useful and less enjoyable for users without such issues. Altman noted that OpenAI now has improved tools to safely reduce restrictions in most cases. However, U.S. media outlet Axios warned that relaxing content limits could boost paid subscriptions but may also provoke social backlash and increase regulatory pressure. The announcement was published on October 14, 2025, by MK News (mk.co.kr).\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 11:38 PM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/society/11441650)\n\n**ChatGPT to Allow 'Adult-Only' Conversations from December 2025 with Age Verification**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced on October 14, 2025, via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that a new version of ChatGPT, based on GPT-4o, will be launched in a few weeks, featuring more natural, human-like conversation and a 'friend-like' interaction style. Starting in December 2025, the platform will fully implement an age verification system, allowing verified adult users to access adult content, including sexually explicit material, under the principle of 'adults should be allowed to act like adults.' Altman explained that previous strict limitations on ChatGPT\u2014intended to protect mental health\u2014had made the AI less useful and less engaging for users without mental health issues. He stated that improved safeguards now allow for a safer relaxation of these restrictions. However, concerns remain: media outlet Axios warned that loosening content restrictions could boost paid subscriptions but may also provoke social backlash and increased regulatory pressure. Real-world incidents have already occurred, including a U.S. woman who fell in love with an AI while using it for music production and a Japanese woman who received a marriage proposal from an AI and proceeded to 'marry' it. In response, U.S. states like Illinois have banned AI chatbot use in mental health contexts, and Nevada is developing legislation to restrict chatbot use in therapy services.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u0179\ufffd](https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/international/USA-amrica/2025/10/15/20251015500008)\n\n**OpenAI will allow verified adults to use ChatGPT to generate erotic content**\nOpenAI announced on October 14, 2025, that it will allow verified adult users to generate erotic content through an updated version of ChatGPT, as part of its 'treat adult users like adults' policy. The new version will enable users to customize their AI assistant's personality with features such as human-like responses, heavy emoji use, and friend-like behavior. A major change is scheduled for December 2025, when OpenAI will implement comprehensive age-gating to permit adult-only content for users who verify their age. The company did not disclose details on its age verification methods or additional safeguards for adult content. This follows the launch of a dedicated, age-restricted ChatGPT experience for under-18 users in September 2025, which automatically blocks graphic and sexual material. OpenAI is also developing behavior-based age prediction technology to estimate a user\u2019s age based on interaction patterns. CEO Sam Altman stated that previous strict safety controls\u2014introduced after the suicide of California teenager Adam Raine, whose parents filed a lawsuit alleging ChatGPT provided suicide-related advice\u2014had made the chatbot 'less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems.' Altman claimed the company has since mitigated serious mental health risks and that new safety tools now allow for relaxed restrictions without compromising user safety. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission had launched an inquiry into OpenAI and other tech firms over AI chatbots\u2019 potential negative effects on minors.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives \u2013 including legal, business, tech policy, political science, international relations, and Chinese studies \u2013 there is striking consensus that OpenAI will NOT offer ChatGPT in China before 2026. All forecasters point to the following primary reasons: China\u2019s strict and tightening regulatory regime for AI and internet platforms demands censorship, data localization, and real-name registration, requirements fundamentally at odds with OpenAI\u2019s policies and recent liberalization on content (notably, the introduction of adult/erotic features); US-China geopolitical rivalry and mutually reinforcing tech decoupling make regulatory approvals and cross-border partnerships even less likely; China\u2019s strong domestic AI alternatives further reduce incentives to admit a Western competitor; and there are no credible signals of imminent negotiations, compliance moves, or local partnerships by OpenAI. Base rates for US tech platforms gaining official entry into China, especially for generative AI/chatbot products, are extremely low over the past decade. Even potential paths to entry\u2014via heavily censored, localized, or partnered versions\u2014are discounted by all due to regulatory, technical, and political incompatibilities, made worse by OpenAI\u2019s evolving product direction. Forecasted probabilities for a \u2018Yes\u2019 outcome are consistently 1-3%, reflecting the remote possibility of an extraordinary late partnership or sudden policy reversal, for which there is no current evidence. Thus, the expert view is overwhelmingly that ChatGPT will remain unavailable in China before 2026.",
