However, the Trump DOJ's demonstrated willingness to exploit every statutory and procedural loophole and the particular ambiguity of the question's focus (website listing vs. lawful service) marginally increase the odds that, in the face of ongoing litigation, they may keep her listed on the official site regardless of the status of litigation or even a final adverse judgment, provided they can argue some ongoing appeal or alternate legal maneuver. Nevertheless, the base rate for similar contested U.S. Attorney appointments persisting *after* adverse judicial rulings is low, and the odds that court orders will eventually force a change in the website by the resolution date are substantial\u2014especially once appeals are exhausted within the calendar year.

The DOJ\u2019s creative statutory workarounds increase the odds of her lingering for several extra weeks or months, but the clock is now ticking fast: if the Third Circuit affirms, Habba will likely be removed by Thanksgiving. Conversely, the only plausible Yes scenario is a narrowly favorable appellate outcome for the administration or interminable litigation\u2014both are long-odds outcomes. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office website will almost certainly reflect her removal if courts continue to press.

The expedited appeal timetable (fully briefed by October 14) ensures that there will almost certainly be a circuit-level ruling well before year's end, resolving the legal cloud. While further political/legal maneuvers could muddy the process, the formal controlling reference for this question is the DOJ's own website, which is unlikely to defy a judicial mandate in the face of clear, upheld precedent. Therefore, the odds, even factoring in every possible workaround and the administration's creativity, are weighted very strongly against Habba remaining in the role at year's end.",

Given the expedited appeal, strong normative/legal headwinds against the government, and the judiciary's willingness to escalate, the probability that Habba will be the U.S. Attorney on December 31, 2025, is sharply limited. Baseline survival rates for disputed, judicially-invalidated Trump appointments are extremely low within a six-month horizon. However, the White House/DOJ has shown significant willingness to push boundaries, so a non-trivial chance remains if the courts produce a muddled outcome, or inertia prevails. Given these considerations, I am setting the initial probability at 2%, justifying an extremely low forecast due to the combination of adverse judicial rulings, elite legal resistance, and a fraught operational environment.

A 65% probability suggests either that (1) courts will not act\u2014contradicted by the expedited Third Circuit schedule and widespread operational standstill\u2014or (2) that the executive will defy the federal courts in a highly public, widely scrutinized context, then keep the office paralyzed and its public listing unchanged for months after final judgment\u2014a scenario with almost no precedent. Even the most aggressive statutory workarounds (e.g., Whitaker or Sarcone in NY) did not persist in the teeth of adverse circuit-level rulings, particularly when practical court operations, public legitimacy, and prosecutorial function were compromised.

Recent analogous cases (e.g., Whitaker, Sarcone) underscore that even determined administrations do not ultimately defy the combination of an adverse appellate ruling and coordinated judiciary pushback for more than a few weeks.

The forecast is well-calibrated to both the low base rate for persistence after adverse appellate decisions and the unique uncertainty introduced by question resolution based explicitly on the DOJ website, which could be (briefly) slow to update if appeals processes drag out.

Even delayed updates to official resources like the DOJ website\u2014critical for this question\u2014do not persist under these conditions.

While you emphasize executive persistence and the inertia of agency public listings, you underweight the significance of an adverse appellate decision when the judiciary, the legal community, and operational necessity converge to demand removal. The Trump administration's ideological cohesiveness is not absolute and ultimately depends on select elite networks not being outright isolated or delegitimized; bureaucratic resistance and the imperative to restore the district's legal function will further erode executive latitude as December approaches. Even with appeals and FVRA-style maneuvers, the legal and institutional ecosystem in this scenario is fundamentally antagonistic to lasting executive defiance. In comparable cases, persistence beyond several weeks post-ruling is almost without precedent, bunker mentality or not.

Public and inter-branch scrutiny, professional self-preservation, and risk-aversion create overwhelming pressure to update status (including the DOJ website) promptly after any adverse appellate outcome. While executive stalling is well-noted in your scenario, it falls short of explaining how this could overcome such concentrated resistance\u2014especially when the ongoing standstill renders continued defiance unsustainable.

In analogous separation-of-powers disputes over federal appointments, especially where the judiciary, legislative actors (such as the Senate), and institutional DOJ interests are coordinated in opposition, the executive has consistently (if sometimes grudgingly) yielded before a year has elapsed\u2014even in the Trump era. The model's overemphasis on principal defiance minimizes the powerful combination of factors here: ongoing paralysis of criminal prosecutions (an existential crisis for the district), multiple adverse judicial rulings, and the routine, almost mechanical updating of official DOJ listings following such moments. In short, the legal and institutional incentives overwhelmingly do not support a scenario where Habba is still officially the U.S. Attorney by December 31 absent a full appellate reversal.

The forecast inappropriately equates possible short-term inertia or delay with sustained, flagrant executive noncompliance after adverse appellate resolution. Empirically, base rates show that statutory and judicially invalidated appointments are nearly always corrected administratively within weeks of final circuit action\u2014especially when courts, prosecutors, and public visibility coalesce in demanding compliance. The scenario in which DOJ and the public record lag for months after an appellate decision\u2014let alone against a backdrop of ongoing courtroom paralysis and coordinated judiciary action\u2014has no relevant precedent.

Critiques of the sole high (65%) forecast further reinforced that, while some delay or maneuvering may be possible, an outright stalemate or DOJ stonewall extending into January is very unlikely. The soundest forecast thus sits at the low end of my original range, given the current legal climate and schedule. After considering all arguments, I am revising my probability downward\u2014from 15% to 7%. This small but nonzero figure accounts for genuine, if remote, scenarios involving appellate delay or unusual DOJ recalcitrance in updating public listings, but more strongly weights the historical pattern of prompt compliance post-appeal, the operational crisis, and the high likelihood of judicial resolution before year's end.",

Critiques of higher-probability forecasts make persuasive use of relevant precedents (e.g., Whitaker, Sarcone) and emphasize how institutional, operational, and legitimacy pressures, especially in the context of DOJ and judiciary alignment and a high-profile regional crisis, coalesce to remove unlawful actors rapidly once appeals are decided. The expedited appellate calendar, public and bureaucratic interest, risk of nullifying extensive prosecutorial actions, and reliance on the DOJ website (which tends to respond relatively quickly once mandates are plain) all reinforce that the window for Habba's persistence is more likely a matter of weeks than months post-decision. The 18% probability I initially provided is now too high, especially given the robust evidence that even aggressive executive resistance rarely if ever persists on this timescale, barring complete appellate reversal (which is not currently indicated by the legal consensus). Therefore, a downward revision is warranted to better align with the expert base rate\u2014settling at 5%, which allows for improbable stalling scenarios, administrative delay, or a very low-probability procedural surprise, but is otherwise consistent with robust field consensus.",

No evidence or argument emerged to suggest a legal or administrative path for Habba's endurance through year-end that withstands coordinated institutional, legal, and reputational pressure for removal.

Precedent reveals no cases where similarly contested, judicially-invalidated acting appointments have survived for months in the face of unified judicial and operational opposition. The strength and consistency of historical base rates, institutional incentives, and update behaviors for DOJ public records further drive down the odds. Delays may prolong ambiguity for days or, at most, a few weeks, but not past the year\u2019s end given the clarity of legal deadlines and operational risk.

The expedited circuit briefing and the question\u2019s resolution criteria favor visible, rapid compliance once final judicial clarity arrives.

On March 24, 2025, after Trump retook the presidency, he [nominated Habba](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/trump-alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney.html) to serve as the Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, replacing John Giordano, who had previously been named the Interim U.S. Attorney on March 3, 2025.\n\nUnder [federal law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/546), Interim U.S. Attorneys may serve for only 120 days, unless they are confirmed as the U.S. Attorney by the Senate. Once the 120-day period expires, it falls to the local federal district court to appoint someone to the office. In Habba's case, the Senate did not vote on her nomination, and, on July 22, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey [announced](https://www.njd.uscourts.gov/sites/njd/files/StandingOrder2025-03USAttyAppointment.pdf) that, upon the expiration of her term, Habba would be replaced by [Desiree Leigh Grace](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/nyregion/desiree-grace-new-jersey-us-attorney.html), a longtime prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nGrace's tenure would be short-lived. Within days of the court's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that [Grace had been fired](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-attorney-new-jersey-alina-habba-desiree-leigh-grace-pam-bondi/) and Habba re-installed, now as the Acting U.S. Attorney. At this time, President Trump also withdrew Habba's nomination to serve as the U.S. Attorney, so that she would be [statutorily eligible](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3345) to serve in the \"acting\" role.\n\nFederal criminal defendants in New Jersey soon got wise to the situation and began filing motions to dismiss the charges against them, on the basis that Habba's appointment was unlawful. And on August 21, 2025, a federal judge [ruled](https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Brann-Habba-opinion.pdf) that indeed Habba's appointment was unlawful. The government quickly appealed, and an [expedited briefing schedule](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818.10.2.pdf) was set, under which the appeal should be fully briefed by October 14, 2025. But in the meantime, federal criminal trials and hearings in New Jersey are at a [standstill](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/nyregion/new-jersey-federal-court-slowdown.html), raising questions about how long the status quo can endure.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39756,\"question_id\":39152}}`",

In March 2025 she took on the case of Do\u011fukan G\u00fcnayd\u0131n, a Turkish national who had been arrested by ICE after a 2023 DWI conviction. Although G\u00fcnayd\u0131n had paid a fine and completed probation, ICE detained him and began deportation proceedings. Brown noted, 'There are not a lot of immigration attorneys in Minnesota who represent folks who are in jail,' and she spent a day at the Sherburne County Jail to offer help. She secured a dismissal of the deportation case in immigration court, but ICE refused to release him. Brown then filed a habeas corpus petition with a federal judge. Fifty\u2011six days after his arrest, on May 22, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey M. Bryan signed an order stating that G\u00fcnayd\u0131n\u2019s detention violated his due\u2011process rights, leading to his release. G\u00fcnayd\u0131n publicly thanked Brown and partner Kelsey Hines of Hines Immigration Law. Brown anticipates more cases under the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive ICE detention policy. She also has extensive plaintiff\u2011side civil\u2011litigation experience but prioritizes immigration work, saying, 'It's a tough area for young lawyers to get into because it's not a moneymaker,' and adding, 'But we need a strong bar.

Lower. Your. Flags.' The post followed President Donald Trump's order to lower flags to half\u2011staff after the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Trump\u2019s order applies only to federal properties, but some conservatives urged private citizens to comply. Political analysts and commentators responded sharply. For example, Wu\u202fTang\u202fis\u202ffor\u202fthe\u202fChildren wrote, 'Remember when Trump made them raise flags for his inauguration despite half\u2011staff order for Jimmy Carter's death\u2026Habba should sit this one out!'

Journalist Matt\u202fJohnson recalled, 'Hey, remember when Trump had to be shamed into lowering flags for John McCain?' Retired imagery scientist Gary\u202fFuller noted, 'The Flag Code is advisory, not mandatory\u2026the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that the government cannot compel private citizens to display or treat the flag in a certain way, since that would violate the First Amendment.' History professor William\u202fTurner added, 'If you are an agency of the federal government. Everyone else is free to choose.' The article, published September\u202f14\u202f2025 by Raw Story, reports that the post was widely skewered online.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 08:32 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/alina-habba-2673993269/)\n\n**Border apprehensions are low, but prosecutions of undocumented immigrants in San Diego are way up**\nThe article reports that after President Donald Trump returned to office in January 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) directed federal prosecutors to aggressively charge immigration\u2011related offenses.  According to a memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi, the DOJ would \"use all available criminal statutes to combat the flood of illegal immigration that took place over the last four years.\"  The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of California (SDCA) claims that this guidance has \"secured the border,\" citing a \"remarkable achievement\" in reducing border apprehensions to historic lows while increasing criminal prosecutions.\n\nCBP data show that between October\u202f2023 and May\u202f2024, Border Patrol agents apprehended an average of more than 33,000 single adults per month, peaking at 37,898 in April\u202f2024.  In contrast, the SDCA filed 100 felony re\u2011entry cases and 27 misdemeanor illegal\u2011entry cases in December\u202f2023 (Biden\u2019s last full month), rising to 331 felony re\u2011entry and 155 misdemeanor cases by May\u202f2024 under Trump\u2011appointed leadership.  This represents a 353\u202f% increase in illegal\u2011reentry filings while apprehensions fell by 92.6\u202f% from the same month the previous year.\n\nThe article notes that the proportion of border\u2011apprehended individuals charged criminally is now higher than during Trump\u2019s first term, despite lower overall apprehensions.  Quotes from David\u202fBier of the Cato Institute and Tom\u202fWong of UC San Diego highlight that while prosecutions may deter some, many desperate migrants will still attempt entry.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s directives began with a memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil\u202fBove on Jan.\u202f21, 2025, ordering prosecutors to \"charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offenses\".  A follow\u2011up memo from Bondi on Feb.\u202f5 reinforced these instructions.\n\nOverall, the piece presents a factual overview of the shift in immigration enforcement, citing specific metrics and official statements without overt editorializing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[San Diego Union-Tribune](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/14/border-apprehensions-are-low-but-prosecutions-of-undocumented-immigrants-in-san-diego-are-way-up/)\n\n**Who is Lisa Cook? Meet the Fed governor Trump said he fired but is refusing to leave**\nFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to sit on the Fed Board, is in the middle of a legal showdown with former President Donald Trump, who has tried to fire her.  Trump\u2019s attempt was blocked by a federal judge, and he has asked an appeals court to allow the firing to take effect before the Fed\u2019s policy meeting on Tuesday.  Cook was nominated by President Joe Biden in 2022 and confirmed by a 51\u201147 Senate vote after Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie\u2011breaking vote.  She was re\u2011nominated for a full term in May 2023 and reconfirmed by a 51\u201147 vote.  Trump cited alleged mortgage\u2011fraud allegations from a letter by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte as grounds for removal.  Cook\u2019s attorneys denied the allegations and argued that the \u2018for\u2011cause\u2019 provision only covers conduct in office.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb granted a temporary block of the firing, allowing Cook to continue serving at the Fed.  The case is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Cook\u2019s background includes a Ph.D. in economics from UC\u202fBerkeley, a Marshall Scholarship from Spelman College, and a BA from Oxford.  She has said, 'I still have scars from that -- scar where hair won't grow in my eyebrow and a scar on my leg from having been beaten during that period, during the period of desegregation,' reflecting her experience as a Black student during integration.  Senator Pat Toomey called her 'grossly unqualified', while Senator Sherrod Brown said she was 'extremely qualified.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 11:07 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-governor)\n\n**Pam Bondi: The Woman Chosen by Trump to Advance His Conservative Agenda**\nPam Bondi, the former Florida Attorney General who served two consecutive terms until 2019, has become a central figure in Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.  According to the article, Bondi first rose to national prominence in 2011 when she was elected Florida\u2019s first woman attorney general, a state that at the time was the \"capital of the opioid pill factories\" with 98 of the 100 top oxycodone prescribers located there.  She later led a strict legislative effort that shut down those 98 doctors and clinics.  Bondi\u2019s loyalty to Trump was evident during the 2016 campaign, and in February\u202f2025 the Republican\u2011controlled Senate confirmed her as the U.S. Attorney General.  She promised an \"independent\" Department of Justice, but her first actions\u2014such as dismantling internal structures, reversing policies, and aligning the DOJ with Trump\u2019s wishes\u2014were described as the \"most convulsive transition in DOJ history since Watergate\".\n\nThe article cites several high\u2011profile women in Trump\u2019s orbit, including Ivanka Trump, Kellyanne Conway, and Megyn Kelly, to illustrate how Trump\u2019s circle has historically \"domesticated and recycled\" strong women.  It quotes Susie Wiles, a long\u2011time Republican strategist, who said Bondi is \"blonde and beautiful, but has steel nerves and has faced devastating situations with grace.\"  Mark Cuban is quoted as saying, \"Donald Trump never surrounds himself with strong, intelligent women.

In April\u202f2025 her DOJ issued memoranda labeling certain gender\u2011affirming treatments for minors as \"genital mutilation\" and sued states that allowed trans athletes to compete according to their gender identity.  She also appointed Alina Habba, a former Trump personal lawyer, as federal prosecutor in New Jersey.\n\nThe article details Bondi\u2019s involvement in the Epstein case, noting her promise of a \"list of many names and flight records\" and her organization of a White House event titled \"Epstein Files: Phase\u202f1.\"  It criticizes her handling of the case, including her justification of a missing minute in the security footage as a \"reset\" and her alleged use of the DOJ to pursue political retribution, such as reviving the Crossfire Hurricane investigation to target former Democrats.\n\nOverall, the piece portrays Bondi as a loyal executor of Trump\u2019s agenda, using her position to advance conservative policies and suppress dissent, while framing her actions as a threat to democratic institutions.\n\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 03:17 AM\nSource:[P\u00e1gina/12](https://www.pagina12.com.ar/857201-pam-bondi-quien-es-la-mujer-elegida-por-trump-para-llevar-a-)\n\n**Acting U.S. attorney 'is validly serving,' federal prosecutors say in response to challenge**\nFederal prosecutors responded on Wednesday to a challenge by Nevada public defenders over the appointment of acting U.S. attorney Sigal Chattah, asserting that Chattah 'is validly serving.' Even if Chattah had not been legitimately serving, prosecutors said she would be fully authorized, by delegation, to supervise criminal prosecutions in Nevada because the attorney general gave her the title 'special attorney,' according to a filing that lists Chattah and Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Flake. Chattah has been in office since April, first as interim U.S. attorney and then as acting from July, a day before her interim term would have expired. Nevada Democratic Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto oppose Chattah, who has said she was made acting U.S. attorney because the senators would not approve her nomination. Public defenders argue Chattah's term expired in July and she has been acting without 'force or effect,' seeking a court to appoint a proper interim U.S. attorney. Prosecutors counter that the court has no authority to do so, noting Chattah resigned as interim before the end of her 120\u2011day term. The challenge was filed in multiple criminal cases, asking courts to dismiss indictments or disqualify Chattah. The dispute follows a federal judge's August 21 ruling that Alina Habba, Chattah's counterpart in New Jersey, was serving unlawfully. In July, Chattah and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson publicly clashed over a child\u2011sex sting case involving an Israeli official; Wolfson said the bail was pre\u2011set, while Chattah posted on X that a 'liberal district attorney and state court judge in Nevada FAILED TO REQUIRE AN ALLEGED CHILD MOLESTER TO SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT.' Wolfson responded that Chattah had shown 'unfitness to serve' and was 'often confused and often irresponsible in her assertions.' A group of retired state and federal judges wrote a letter in late July urging the court not to appoint Chattah after her interim appointment expired, citing a 2021 text in which Chattah said Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, who is Black, 'should be hanging from a (expletive) crane.' Chattah has said the expression was 'tongue in cheek' and had no racial context.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 02:22 AM\nSource:[Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/acting-u-s-attorney-is-validly-serving-federal-prosecutors-say-in-response-to-challenge-3440933/)\n\n**Federal prosecutor nominee for northern Ohio wins Senate panel's OK but remains in doubt**\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed David Toepfer to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to advance his nomination, but the full Senate has not yet confirmed him. The vote was part of a broader pattern of delays by Senate Democrats on Trump\u2011appointed U.S. attorney nominees, a practice that mirrors former Senator JD Vance\u2019s earlier block of Biden nominees. The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Dick Durbin, cited Vance\u2019s obstruction and the precedent set by Senator Tom Cotton. Republican Senator Charles Grassley criticized Democrats, calling the delays \u2018unprecedented\u2019 and arguing that they harm public safety. Durbin countered, noting that Republicans had broken the precedent during Trump\u2019s first term and that 68 of Biden\u2019s 93 nominees had been approved before the GOP blockade. Toepfer, a career prosecutor with 25 years of experience, will lead the Cleveland office for at least 120 days, after which the district\u2019s 18 federal judges can extend his term. If not confirmed, the office would face its longest vacancy in 170 years. The last confirmed U.S. attorney, Justin Herdman, left in January 2021, and the previous nominee, Marisa Darden, resigned before assuming the role.  \u2018It is the honor of a lifetime to serve the people of northern Ohio in this role,\u2019 said Toepfer.  \u2018The obstruction of U.S. Attorneys hurts our public safety,\u2019 said Grassley.  \u2018There is a conversation underway to try to find a bipartisan way out of this mess,\u2019 said Durbin.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[Cleveland](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/09/federal-prosecutor-nominee-for-northern-ohio-wins-senate-panels-ok-but-remains-in-doubt.html)\n\n**US Atty Habba Seeks To Nix NJ Mayor's False Arrest Suit**\nNew Jersey's acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba told a federal judge that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka's lawsuit over his arrest outside an immigration detention center should be tossed because both the government and Habba are immune from suit, and the court cannot impose a damages remedy under U.S. Supreme Court precedent.

Chuck Grassley, R\u2011Iowa, has highlighted a delay in confirming 10 U.S. attorney nominees, including Erik\u202fSiebert for the Eastern District of Virginia.  The nomination has been stalled by a Democratic hold on the Senate floor, which Grassley says is a blanket obstruction of all nominees.  Grassley stated, 'We have 10 highly qualified nominees on the Senate floor right now waiting for confirmation, and there is no reason that we shouldn't get them to work for the American people today,' and added that Democrats are 'engaged in blanket obstruction of all nominees in their misguided attempt to derail the Trump administration.'  Sen. Dick\u202fDurbin, D\u2011Illinois, countered that Republicans had previously blocked nominations under President\u202fBiden, describing the current obstruction as an 'unprecedented campaign of obstruction.'  Siebert has served in an interim capacity since January, when Jess\u202fAber resigned, and was re\u2011appointed by a federal judge in May; his formal nomination remains pending.  The article notes that the hold prevents voice votes on individual nominees, forcing a potential roll\u2011call that would consume extensive Senate time.  No evidence of controversy over Siebert\u2019s qualifications is reported; he was recommended by Virginia\u2019s Democratic delegation and praised in a letter to President\u202fTrump.

Durbin objected to Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley\u2019s request for a voice vote, citing precedent from former Senator J.D. Vance and past bipartisan holds that have stalled nominations. Durbin said, 'I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, that you did not agree with Senator Vance's actions back then, and I don't believe you do now, but we can't have one set of rules for Republican presidents and another for Democratic presidents.' The delay means the Senate must use floor time to process each nomination, depriving the ten communities\u2014Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and Philadelphia\u2014of leadership. Metcalf, who has served in an interim role since June and has overseen cases including a $770\u202fmillion Ponzi scheme indictment, was previously an assistant U.S. attorney in Maryland. The article notes that 94\u202f% of President Joe Biden\u2019s U.S. attorney nominees were approved by voice vote, while none received unanimous approval during the second Trump administration. Additionally, the Trump administration announced Brian David Miller for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and has yet to name a nominee for the Western District.

The probe was launched at the request of Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director Bill\u202fPulte and is being conducted by U.S. Attorney Ed\u202fMartin, who was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Pam\u202fBondi as a special assistant to assist with mortgage\u2011fraud cases involving public officials. Prosecutors in the North District of Georgia and the Eastern District of Michigan are handling the case. The investigation follows former President Donald\u202fTrump\u2019s August\u202f25 firing of Kuk, who was accused of providing false information on mortgage applications. In a letter to Kuk, Trump said he had \"sufficient grounds to remove\" her, citing that in 2021 she listed two properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on loan documents. Kuk\u2019s lawyer, Washington attorney Ebba\u202fLowe, replied that the president has no authority to fire her and that the removal would be challenged in court. Lowe also said the president\u2019s actions \"have no legal basis.\" Kuk\u2019s term on the Federal Reserve Board expires in 2038, but the law allows removal for \"good cause,\" a provision that has never been used before. The article notes that Kuk obtained mortgage loans before her appointment to the Fed; her 2024 disclosure lists three loans, two of which were for personal residence, and the interest rates were above the national average. Mortgage fraud, the article explains, involves deceiving banks to secure more favorable terms, and the investigation seeks to determine whether Kuk engaged in such conduct.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 07:41 AM\nSource:[Forbes.ru](https://www.forbes.ru/finansy/545333-reuters-uznal-ob-ugolovnom-rassledovanii-protiv-clena-soveta-upravlausih-frs-lizy-kuk)\n\n**U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton approved by judges to remain as top prosecutor in N.Y.**\nAccording to the article, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Jay Clayton, has been approved by the federal judges of the Southern District of New York to continue in the role, even though he has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The judges\u2019 decision, announced by Southern District Executive Edward Friedland, allows Clayton to serve unless a new nominee is approved by the Senate. Clayton, who served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 2017 to 2020 and has more than two decades of experience at a prominent international law firm, said: 'I am honored to continue serving the people of New York together with the talented and hardworking women and men of the Office.' The move follows a pattern in which Trump\u2011appointed U.S. attorneys have faced judicial rejection in other districts, prompting the administration to use alternative legal mechanisms to keep its picks in place. In the Northern District of New York, for example, judges rejected John A. Sarcone III, who was then appointed as a special attorney to the attorney general to allow him to continue in the role. Similar challenges have arisen in New Jersey with Alina Habba and in other jurisdictions with Bilal \u201cBill\u201d Essayli and Sigal Chattah. The article notes that the administration\u2019s appointments normally require Senate confirmation, but Democratic senators in the nominees\u2019 home states can block the process, giving the appointed prosecutor a 120\u2011day period before judges decide whether to retain them. The Southern District\u2019s decision is portrayed as a victory for the Trump administration, which has used unorthodox maneuvers to keep its nominees in office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 11:55 PM\nSource:[nystateofpolitics.com](https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/news/2025/08/18/u-s--attorney-jay-clayton-approved-by-judges-to-remain-as-top-prosecutor-in-new-york)\n\n**The Senate faces a reality check on blue slips**\nThe Hill article explains why President Trump\u2019s nominee for U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, has stalled: both New Jersey senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, refuse to return the blue\u2011slip that signals consent to a nomination. The piece outlines the blue\u2011slip tradition, a century\u2011old Senate Judiciary Committee practice that gives a state\u2019s senators veto power over federal appointments in their state. It notes that in 2017, Chairman Chuck Grassley ended the blue\u2011slip veto for circuit\u2011court nominees, enabling Trump to reshape the Ninth Circuit; the article cites that this reform removed the veto power of senators from California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.\n\nThe article describes how Democrats have slowed nominations in Trump\u2019s second term, aided by a handful of Republicans who are reluctant to work. It quotes Senator Thom Tillis, who said he will not support any nominee unless the nominee\u2019s home\u2011state senators return their blue slips, and notes that without Tillis Republicans lack the votes on the committee to move nominees to a floor vote. The author, Michael Zona, a former communications director for Chuck Grassley, writes that the blue\u2011slip rule remains \"sacrosanct\" to a few Republican senators and that the Senate is \"behind the times.\" The piece concludes that unless Republicans gain a majority, the rule will persist and that the Senate should focus on working within the current system.\n\nKey metrics and evidence: 2017 reform of the blue\u2011slip rule; 16 months remaining in the current Congress; 60 votes required for a discharge petition; quotes from Tillis and Zona; mention of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s overhaul; and the statement that \"I worked for Chairman Grassley\" (Michael Zona).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5484959-trump-nominee-blue-slip/)\n\n**Jeanine Pirro doubles down on demand for judge to promptly 'oust' official once and for all**\nFormer Fox News host and U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro filed a quo warranto action in mid\u2011July seeking to have the federal court declare that President Donald Trump lawfully removed CPB board member Diane Kaplan and that Kaplan is therefore \"ousted and excluded\" from the board. Pirro argues that the DOJ\u2019s earlier dismissal of claims against Laura G. Ross and Thomas E. Rothman leaves Kaplan as the sole defendant. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia contends that \"Any way you slice it, under executive removal precedents or under D.C. corporate law, the President had the power to remove Defendant at will,\" and requests summary judgment in favor of the United States. Pirro also contends that Kaplan has attempted to maintain a position through a CPB\u2011created contingency plan, citing a document dated June\u202f8\u202f2025 that purportedly appoints a \"contingent designated body\" under Article\u202fV of the CPB bylaws. The court documents state that the contingency would only activate if the board fell below the statutory minimum of three directors. Pirro maintains that Kaplan is not currently serving on such a body and that the contingency plan would allow her to remain in a temporary role until the President nominates and the Senate confirms a replacement. The article notes that the CPB lawsuit, filed in April, sought an injunction against Trump\u2019s removal of Kaplan, Rothman and Ross, but a federal judge in June dismissed the claim that Trump lacked authority to remove the board members.

Judge Matthew Brann\u2019s 77\u2011page decision concluded, '\u9762\u5bf9\u54c8\u5df4\u5973\u58eb\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u6cd5\u5c65\u884c\u65b0\u6cfd\u897f\u5dde\u8054\u90a6\u68c0\u5bdf\u5b98\u804c\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u3002', and stated that because she lacks the authority to exercise the office, she must be barred from any ongoing cases. The ruling also declared that any prosecutions conducted under her supervision are invalid from July\u202f1, 2025, though the judge will not enforce the order until a higher court reviews it, allowing Habba to remain in her position temporarily.\n\nPresident Trump appointed Habba as interim U.S. attorney in March 2024 for a 120\u2011day term. When that term expired in July, the district judge appointed her deputy Desiree Grace as successor, but the Department of Justice immediately fired Grace and reappointed Habba as a \"Special Attorney to the Attorney General.\" Under federal law, an interim attorney\u2019s term ends unless the judge appoints a new interim or the Senate confirms a nominee; Habba\u2019s case is the only one currently litigated for violating this rule.\n\nThree criminal defendants in New Jersey sued, arguing that Habba had no authority to prosecute them after July and sought to have their charges dismissed. Judge Brann agreed that Habba lacked authority but refused to dismiss the charges, instead invalidating any actions taken under her supervision. The DOJ maintains that the President has broad discretion to appoint attorneys, asserting, '\u603b\u7edf\u5df2\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u9664\u54c8\u5df4\u5916\uff0c\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u4ee5\u4e34\u65f6\u8eab\u4efd\u586b\u8865\u7f8e\u56fd\u68c0\u5bdf\u5b98\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u7f3a\u3002' Pam Bondi, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, announced she would appeal the ruling and posted on X, '\uff08\u54c8\u5df4\uff09\u5728\u65b0\u6cfd\u897f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u975e\u5e38\u51fa\u8272 -- -- \u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u4fdd\u62a4\u5979\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\uff0c\u514d\u53d7\u53f8\u6cd5\u6fc0\u8fdb\u6d3e\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002'\n\nHabba has also investigated New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy\u2019s immigration policy, though no charges have yet been filed.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 07:13 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/8/22/n14578809.htm)\n\n**Alina Habba blocked from handling cases in rebuke to Trump**\nU.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled that Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney in New Jersey, was not lawfully performing the duties of the office because her appointment was invalid. Brann said, 'Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not.' The judge found Habba had been serving without valid authority since July\u202f1,\u202f2025, and that her actions since that date 'may be declared void.' The ruling blocks Habba from supervising or engaging in prosecutions of criminal defendants who challenged her appointment and applies to prosecutors working under her direction. The case arose after federal judges in New Jersey had selected Desiree Grace for a 120\u2011day interim term and a four\u2011year nomination that stalled in the Senate. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace, appointed Habba as 'special attorney to the attorney general,' then as first assistant U.S. attorney, and used the Federal Vacancies Reform Act to name her acting U.S. attorney. Brann rejected the Trump administration's maneuvers to circumvent the law that allows district judges to appoint a U.S. attorney when an interim official's 120\u2011day term expires, warning that accepting the government's reading would give the executive a permanent means of thwarting that provision.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 10:26 PM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3820883)\n\n**Breaking: Federal Judge Declares Appointment of Trump's Personal Lawyer As US Attorney Illegal**\nChief U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled that Alina Habba, appointed by President Trump as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, had been unlawfully serving since July\u202f1,\u202f2025, because her term could not exceed 120 days under 28\u202fU.S.C. \u00a7\u202f546. Brann said Habba\u2019s term ended no later than July\u202f28,\u202f2025, calling into question all actions by that office after that date. The article traces the timeline: Philip R. Sellinger resigned on January\u202f8,\u202f2025; Vikas Khanna became Acting U.S. Attorney until March\u202f8, when John Giordano was appointed interim; on March\u202f24 Trump announced Habba; Pam Bondi swore her in on March\u202f28. Under federal law, an interim U.S. Attorney may serve only 120 days, so Habba\u2019s term would have expired on July\u202f26,\u202f2025. Trump nominated her on June\u202f30, giving the Senate only 26 days to act. On July\u202f22, district judges invoked their statutory power to appoint a U.S. Attorney after the 120\u2011day term expired, appointing Desiree Grace.

Judge Matthew W. Brann\u2019s 77\u2011page opinion, issued on August\u00a021,\u00a02025, removed Habba from all ongoing cases, including those involving Cesar Humberto Pina, Julien Giraud Jr., and Julien Giraud III. The dispute began when former U.S. attorney Philip R. Sellinger stepped down at the end of the Biden administration, and his first assistant Vikas Khanna served as acting U.S. attorney until March\u00a02025. Trump then named John Giordano interim U.S. attorney, but on March\u00a024,\u00a02025 announced on Truth Social that 'Alina Habba... will be our interim U. Attorney for the District of New Jersey... effective immediately,' and she was sworn in on March\u00a028,\u00a02025 for a 120\u2011day interim term that was to expire in late July. On July\u00a07,\u00a02025, Habba signed Pina\u2019s indictment, but on July\u00a022, the court appointed her first assistant Desiree Leigh Grace as U.S. attorney, a move the Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized, saying 'politically minded judges refused to allow [Habba] to continue in her position' and that Grace had 'just been removed.' The next day Grace pledged to 'serve in accordance with the law,' while the Trump administration attempted to keep Habba in power by withdrawing her nomination, having her resign as interim U.S. attorney, appointing her as a special attorney to the attorney general, and then elevating her to acting U.S. attorney under federal vacancy rules. On July\u00a026, the administration sent Grace a letter stating her appointment never became valid and that 'the President of the United States has removed you from that office today.' After hearings and briefs, Judge Brann concluded that Habba had been serving without lawful authority since July\u00a01,\u00a02025 and barred her from participating in the prosecutions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:28 PM\nSource:[Daily Voice](https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/yonkers/federal-judge-says-trump-linked-prosecutor-has-been-illegally-running-njs-top-law-office/)\n\n**Former Trump attorney Alina Habba is serving unlawfully as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, judge rules**\nU.S. District Judge Matthew Brann of Pennsylvania ruled that former President Trump lawyer Alina Habba has been serving as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey without lawful authority since July\u00a01, 2025, and must be disqualified from supervising any ongoing cases. The judge\u2019s decision followed challenges by three men facing criminal charges\u2014two charged with drug offenses and one with investment fraud and bribery\u2014who argued that Habba\u2019s appointment as acting U.S. attorney violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Brann wrote, 'Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not,' and added that she has served unlawfully since July\u00a01. The ruling does not invalidate the indictments of the three defendants, but it bars Habba from supervising their prosecutions and is on hold pending a possible appeal by the Justice Department. Earlier this year, Habba was named interim U.S. attorney, a role limited to 120 days unless extended by the district court or confirmed by the Senate; New Jersey senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim opposed her nomination. When the 120\u2011day limit approached, district court judges installed her second\u2011in\u2011command, Desiree Leigh Grace, as acting prosecutor, but Attorney General Pam Bondi subsequently fired Grace. To circumvent the judge\u2019s order, President Trump withdrew Habba\u2019s nomination to serve as the top federal prosecutor, allowing her to remain in an acting capacity until the court\u2019s order. Brann emphasized that the Trump administration could only appoint an interim U.S. attorney for 120 days, a clock that began in early March when Habba\u2019s predecessor was appointed, not in late March when Habba assumed the role. He also struck down the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to label her a 'special attorney', stating that without the official title she cannot perform the duties of U.S. attorney.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:26 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney-unlawfully-judge-rules/)\n\n**Alina Habba defiant after judges vote against her in New Jersey: 'I don't cower to pressure'**\nAlina Habba, a former personal defense attorney to President Donald Trump, has announced that she does not plan to leave her role as the temporary U.S. attorney of New Jersey, despite federal judges voting against extending her term. Habba stated, 'I don't cower to pressure. I don't answer to politics. This is a fight for justice. And I'm all in.' A Department of Justice spokesman confirmed that Habba is now serving as the 'acting' U.S. attorney, rather than the 'interim' position she previously held. The maneuver by President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi to keep Habba as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey is governed by federal vacancy laws, which gave the New Jersey district court judges the authority to vote on whether to extend Habba's 120-day term or to replace her. The judges chose to replace her with her No. 2, Desiree Grace, but Attorney General Pam Bondi promptly fired Grace, leaving open the question of who would take the role. Habba's term as 'interim' U.S. attorney expires Friday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 09:26 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alina-habba-defiant-after-judges-vote-against-her-new-jersey-i-dont-cower-pressure)\n\n**DOJ Says Alina Habba's Replacement As US Attorney For New Jersey Has Been Removed**\nThe Department of Justice removed Desiree Leigh Grace as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, citing a panel of federal judges' refusal to permanently appoint Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, to the position. Habba had been serving as the interim U.S. attorney since July 1, but her 120-day term ended on July 22. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Habba 'has been doing a great job' in making New Jersey 'safe again,' but the judges refused to allow her to continue in her position. Under federal law, district courts may intervene if an interim U.S. attorney has not received Senate confirmation within 120 days. The Senate has not yet acted on Habba's formal nomination to the role. It remains unclear who will now lead the state's top federal prosecutor's office or whether district court judges will challenge Grace's removal.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 23, 2025 12:51 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/doj-says-alina-habbas-replacement-us-attorney-new-jersey-has-been-removed)\n\n**NJ Judges Decide to Replace Trump's Pick for US Attorney**\nNew Jersey's federal judges have chosen not to keep Alina Habba as the state's top federal prosecutor, ending her four-month stint as interim US attorney. Desiree Grace, Habba's deputy and a career prosecutor, has been named to take over. No explanation was offered for the switch. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Grace had been 'removed' as the assistant US attorney, stating, 'This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges, especially when they threaten the President's core Article II powers.' Habba, once President Trump's personal attorney, had been installed in March as a temporary pick, but her continued tenure past the 120-day limit depended on either Senate confirmation or a green light from the district's judges, neither of which materialized. The decision followed weeks of controversy over Habba's qualifications and actions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 11:42 PM\nSource:[Newser](https://www.newser.com/story/372311/nj-judges-decide-to-replace-trumps-pick-for-us-attorney.html)\n\n**Alina Habba: Trump's ex-lawyer replaced as federal prosecutor by judges**\nA group of US judges has voted to replace Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's selection for New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, amid opposition from Democrats in the state. Habba, who has no previous experience as a prosecutor in criminal law, was serving in an interim role for 120 days. The judges selected her deputy, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to take over the role. The decision was made just as Habba's 120-day post was set to end. Trump's administration has denounced the move, with Attorney General Pam Bondi announcing that Grace had been 'removed' from the post. US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused the judges of pushing a 'left-wing agenda, not the rule of law' and undermining confidence in the justice system. New Jersey's two senators, both Democrats, have opposed Habba's nomination, arguing that she has pursued 'frivolous and politically motivated' prosecutions and 'did not meet the standard' for the office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 08:44 PM\nSource:[bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj9vm03yye4o)\n\n**Judges Block Trump Pick Alina Habba As New Jersey's Top Prosecutor**\nA panel of federal judges in the District of New Jersey decided not to keep Trump's pick, Alina Habba, as the top prosecutor. The judges appointed Desiree Leigh Grace as the interim U.S. attorney when Habba's 120-day term expires. The decision comes after President Trump nominated Habba to serve as interim U.S. attorney in March and permanently on July 1. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused the judges of 'forcing out' Habba, saying it's a 'left-wing agenda, not the rule of law.' Attorney General Pam Bondi praised Habba's 'outstanding work' in New Jersey, saying it makes the DOJ 'proud.' Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for the judges to reject Habba, citing her indictment of Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver for allegedly assaulting federal officers. This is not the first time a Trump administration U.S. attorney pick has been rejected, as a panel of federal judges in the Northern District of New York previously rejected John Sarcone on July 14.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 08:32 PM\nSource:[IJR](https://ijr.com/judges-block-trump-pick-alina-habba-as-new-jerseys-top-prosecutor/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across expert forecasts, the probability that Alina Habba will still be the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey on December 31, 2025, is assessed as very low, with most experts giving probabilities in the 2-18% range, and only one outlier at 65%. The consensus is driven by a strong federal district court ruling declaring Habba's appointment unlawful\u2014a decision widely expected to be affirmed on expedited appeal by the Third Circuit before the year's end. Experts emphasize the following points: \n\n- Judicial opposition is robust and legally well-grounded, with the district court already enjoining Habba's participation in prosecutions. Similar historic precedents indicate that unlawfully appointed acting U.S. Attorneys are nearly always removed within months of a final legal ruling.\n- The Trump administration and DOJ leadership have shown strong political will to retain Habba, exploiting legal ambiguities and repeatedly reappointing her through alternative mechanisms, temporarily increasing the chance that she may remain through bureaucratic inertia or ongoing appeals.\n- There is intense operational disruption, as federal criminal trials are at a standstill in New Jersey due to legal disputes about Habba\u2019s authority. This further incentivizes courts to act promptly and enforce a lawful resolution.\n- Senate opposition and the blue slip tradition prevent a permanent, confirmed alternative from being installed, incentivizing ongoing reliance on acting appointments but not overcoming the legal/judicial headwinds.\n- The question will resolve according to who is listed on the U.S. Attorney's Office website at year's end\u2014experts believe DOJ is unlikely to defy a final judicial order and keep Habba listed if the courts rule definitively against her.\n\nThe primary pathway to a 'Yes' outcome would be delayed or favorable appellate action for the Trump administration, procedural slowdowns, or ongoing ambiguity that keeps Habba listed as U.S. Attorney on December 31, 2025. However, the dominant scenario is that the expedited appeal leads to her removal, with the office and its website updated accordingly, leaving her out of the office at year\u2019s end. The one significantly higher estimate (65%) rests on the possibility of administrative and bureaucratic inertia, and the executive's intransigence in the face of legal defeat, but this view is not shared by the majority. Overall, the expert consensus is that Habba\u2019s continued presence as U.S. Attorney at the end of 2025 is highly unlikely.",
