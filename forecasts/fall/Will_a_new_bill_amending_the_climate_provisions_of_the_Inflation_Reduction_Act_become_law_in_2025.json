Reports of ongoing lawsuits pertain to whether the administration can claw back already-awarded grant money, but do not affect the broader statutory rollback already in law. This means the resolution criteria are almost certainly satisfied for a 'Yes.' The only risk to this would be a technicality in How Metaculus chooses to interpret the precise scope of these amendments, or a late 2025 reversal, neither of which appears likely based on all available public information and base rates of statutory reversals within a single Congress.

Therefore, based on the status of U.S. federal legislative process and the explicit reporting on the OBBBA, the probability that a new bill amending the climate provisions of the IRA became law in 2025 is functionally certain.

The 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' described in detail by multiple news outlets, fits this scenario: it eliminates or phases out key tax credits, reallocates funding, and reduces eligibility for many climate provisions originally enacted in the IRA. This accounts for restriction of benefits, explicit funding cuts, and changes locking in program rollbacks\u2014all meeting the question's 'Yes' criteria.",

News cites explicit elimination or phaseout of tax credits for EVs, wind, and solar; repeal or restriction of federal clean energy programs and grants; and large-scale statutory changes that target the heart of the IRA\u2019s climate agenda. PET suggests that with the unified GOP control after the 2024 election, the preconditions for policy punctuations were met: high ideological motivation, agenda-setting power, and the use of large legislative vehicles. The durability of IRA-generated policy feedback (e.g., new industry advocacy, job creation) was insufficient to prevent rapid reversal due to the scale of the political shock, as evidenced by president Trump\u2019s energy 'emergency' declaration and donor-driven policy direction. The law's scope\u2014documented as rescinding vast amounts of unspent climate funds and directly amending tax and eligibility provisions\u2014clearly meets Metaculus's Yes criteria. As of this date, no countervailing event or court decision reverses this outcome, and no evidence suggests that only appropriations or rulemaking (not statutory amendment) have occurred, eliminating a No as a plausible scenario. Based on the convergence of multiple credible reports and PET\u2019s framework for recognizing legislative punctuations during partisan transitions, I assess the probability as extremely high.",

The news sources across the ideological spectrum unanimously acknowledge the passage and signing of this bill, its implementation (grant cancellations, program terminations), and its central function as a rollback of IRA climate spending and tax credits, explicitly as defined by this question's resolution criteria. While there is legal activism aiming to claw back lost ground (notably program-specific lawsuits), these are unlikely to block or reverse the main statutory changes within the time allowed (until January 1, 2026). Parliamentary reversals within months seem implausible, given GOP unity and legislative calendar constraints. Base rates support that such reversals, once enacted with a party-line government, typically persist for at least the short term.

Judicial reversals of enacted, fully vetted statutes (especially those passed via high-profile and clear majoritarian congressional processes) are rare on compressed timelines, and no current legal challenge appears targeted at overturning the entire climate rollback, only specific programmatic execution.

Their framing of the OBBBA as the clear statutory vehicle for amendment/repeal, and their explicit referencing of mainstream and specialist sources, bolster confidence that the legal bar has been crossed for a 'Yes' outcome. Notably, by foregrounding the legislative base rates in periods of partisan trifecta and emphasizing the dearth of pathways to reversal within the closing window, they produce a reasoning chain that is robust from both a congressional procedure and policy window (Multiple Streams) analysis. Their forecast, therefore, is not only highly credible but provides a factual backbone upon which other disciplinary perspectives can build consensus."

Wyden argues that Trump's promise of 'energy dominance' was fraudulent, citing Trump's February 2025 executive order declaring an 'energy emergency'\u2014a move Wyden claims was designed to benefit Big Oil donors rather than strengthen U.S. energy security. He asserts that Republicans, under Trump\u2019s direction, dismantled key clean energy incentives by eliminating tax credits for wind and solar energy in their budget reconciliation bill\u2014credits passed in 2022 under Democratic leadership that had spurred hundreds of billions in private investment, created hundreds of thousands of jobs, and accelerated U.S. progress in clean energy manufacturing. Wyden notes that these actions reversed the U.S.'s rise from the middle of the global clean energy race to a leading position. He highlights that over $7 billion in clean energy project funding has been canceled, mostly in blue states, with Oregon alone losing over $400 million. Additionally, Republicans have blocked clean energy development on public lands and prioritized coal, which Wyden calls a 'gobsmacking attempt' to harm American families for campaign contributions. He warns that rising energy demand and utility costs now threaten affordability, and that the Republican agenda represents 'economic self-sabotage.' Wyden urges the Senate to support Senator Kaine\u2019s resolution to counter this crisis, emphasizing that the American people voted for lower prices, more jobs, and energy security\u2014not a crisis benefiting Big Oil.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 09:33 PM\nSource:[U.S. Senate Finance Committee](https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-blasts-republicans-for-manufacturing-nationwide-energy-crisis)\n\n**Clean hydrogen energy revolution is being hijacked by corporate greed, crony deals, and political shortsightedness   - NaturalNews.com**\nThe article argues that the clean hydrogen energy revolution is being undermined by corporate greed, political shortsightedness, and the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which undermines the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s 45V tax credit for clean hydrogen after 2027. This creates uncertainty for long-term investments, as hydrogen plant development takes 5\u201310 years. Currently, most hydrogen is produced via steam methane reforming (SMR), generating 'gray hydrogen' that is dirtier than coal. 'Blue hydrogen,' which uses carbon capture and storage (CCS), is also problematic due to high energy use, leakage, and poor performance\u2014e.g., Chevron\u2019s Gorgon project captured only 30% of emissions. 'Green hydrogen,' produced using renewable electricity, is the gold standard but requires massive infrastructure and renewable energy scaling\u201450-fold increase by 2030 per the IEA\u2014currently unattainable without a major push. Bio-hydrogen (Bio-H\u2082), made from agricultural waste and forest residues, is a viable near-term solution, cutting 1.8 to 5.5 kg CO\u2082 per kg of hydrogen and reducing wildfire risks. The 45V credit initially enabled Bio-H\u2082 and green hydrogen to compete with gray hydrogen, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases it out, while extending tax breaks for underperforming blue hydrogen projects. Experts like Yuan Yao (Yale) and Wei Peng (Princeton) criticize the policy as a 'ladder-pulling' strategy and a 'vape vs. cigarette' analogy, respectively. The article also highlights a misalignment in deployment: hydrogen is being used in inefficient applications like fuel tanks instead of high-emission sectors like steel production, where it could deliver massive emissions reductions. The Yale study recommends targeted subsidies for industrial use and allowing diverse clean technologies to compete, but asserts that political courage is lacking in Washington.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:05 PM\nSource:[NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-10-08-clean-hydrogen-energy-revolution-stifled-by-corporate-greed-politics.html)\n\n**The Left's energy amnesia**\nThe article argues that despite Democrats' climate goals, their energy policies have undermined energy affordability and reliability. It claims the fracking revolution, not cap-and-trade legislation, was responsible for lowering energy bills and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even achieving emissions targets without the bill passing. The piece criticizes Democratic policies under Obama and Biden for disrupting energy markets through subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline, reduced oil/gas lease sales, a methane tax, and premature closures of power plants via the Clean Power Plan 2.0, which would have banned natural gas baseload plants and mandated costly carbon capture. The article contends these regulations contradict basic economics by forcing compliance spending instead of productive investment, citing the broken window fallacy. It also highlights Democratic-driven electrification mandates and bans on fossil fuel use in homes and vehicles, which create regulatory uncertainty and delays. Despite growing Democratic support for permitting reform, the article asserts that delays have already worsened energy bottlenecks, particularly for renewables, solar, transmission, and pipelines\u2014where one pipeline\u2019s permitting cost reportedly exceeded its construction cost. The author urges permitting reform to stabilize energy policy, reduce dependency on bureaucratic discretion, and align with both energy dominance and climate goals. The piece concludes that energy success should be driven by market forces, not political cycles, and that reform is essential to avoid punishing consumers. The argument is attributed to Nick Loris, executive vice president of policy at C3 Solutions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:22 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3840507/energy-crisis-climate-agenda-permitting-reform/)\n\n**Why is the GOP adopting Democrats' worst energy ideas? | Opinion**\nMichael E. Webber, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, argues in an opinion piece published by the Houston Chronicle on October 7, 2025, that the Republican Party is adopting the worst energy policies from the Democratic Party's past, particularly those from the Carter administration. He criticizes the Trump administration for abandoning the 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy and instead arbitrarily canceling approved offshore wind projects\u2014such as one off Rhode Island that was nearly completed\u2014leading to costly delays. Onshore renewable projects are also hindered by new permitting hurdles and political reviews. Webber draws a parallel to the 1978 Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act, which banned new natural gas power plants, resulting in a decade of increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions due to the construction of dirtier coal plants. The ban was repealed in 1987, leading to a 'Dash for Gas' in the 1990s and 2000s. Now, Republicans are repeating this mistake by opposing wind and solar, promoting coal, and blocking new transmission lines\u2014policies that, like the Carter-era bans, will lead to higher electricity prices and reduced supply. Despite some support for nuclear and geothermal energy, these sources will not scale until the 2030s. Webber warns that this policy reversal risks a 1970s-style stagflation, with inflation and unemployment rising due to government-imposed energy constraints. He calls on Republicans to return to their core principles of market-driven energy abundance, especially as demand from AI data centers, electric vehicles, and new factories grows, and as Democrats under Biden have successfully expanded energy production across oil, gas, wind, and solar while reducing imports and emissions. 'If they don't, we'll all end up paying the price,' Webber concludes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Houston Chronicle](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/gop-adopting-democrats-worst-energy-ideas-21085599.php)\n\n**subsidised carbon emissions...**\nSubsidies for fossil fuel companies in the United States have doubled since 2017, now totaling $35 billion annually, according to a report by Oil Change International. Despite growing political rhetoric about the climate crisis, both the Trump and Biden administrations have expanded fossil fuel subsidies through legislation such as the GOP budget bill signed in July, which added nearly $40 billion in subsidies over ten years\u2014about $4 billion per year\u2014and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which included fossil fuel incentives despite Biden\u2019s campaign promise to end such subsidies. The report highlights that fossil fuel subsidies are often permanent, unlike renewable energy tax breaks, and include long-standing provisions like the deduction of intangible drilling costs, allowing companies to immediately deduct 100% of non-operational expenses. Additionally, billions in taxpayer money are funneled into carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, with government and independent estimates projecting potential tax credit costs of up to $3.6 trillion by 2050. These funds could instead support 3 million families with food assistance annually. Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International and report author, stated that the public costs of fossil fuel subsidies\u2014encompassing environmental degradation, health impacts, and climate damage\u2014far exceed any benefits to energy affordability. He called on Congress to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and redirect funds toward healthcare, housing, and clean, affordable renewable energy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[yourdemocracy.net](https://yourdemocracy.net/drupal/node/57014)\n\n**Shovel-ready? Building US Critical Mineral Resilience**\nThe Trump administration's energy dominance policy, implemented since January 2025, has significantly reshaped the U.S. critical minerals sector by shifting focus from tax credits and free trade preferences to expanding domestic mined and refined supply. Key initiatives include administrative deregulation, accelerated permitting via the National Energy Dominance Council (established February 2025), and the rescission of certain NEPA regulatory burdens on June 30, 2025, which allows for narrower environmental reviews and page limits. The administration has also expanded federal financing tools: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) enables 100% first-year cost deductions for qualifying manufacturing projects built before 2029 and operational by January 1, 2031. Additionally, the Department of Defense and other federal bodies are using offtake powers to support national security-critical projects. Tariffs have been raised under Section 232: steel from 25% to 50%, aluminum from 10% to 50%, and semi-refined copper from 0% to 50% effective August 1, 2025, with further tariffs on processed critical minerals under review. Diplomatic efforts include the Washington Accord between the DRC and Rwanda, a U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund with a $75 million DFC equity commitment, and memoranda of cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The DFC is also expanding its investment capacity, with reauthorization pending in November 2025. However, federal budget impasses have delayed permitting, creating a narrow 12\u201324 month window for projects to secure financing and approvals. Projects not 'shovel-ready' must accelerate development before this window closes. While copper, rare earths, uranium, and gold projects are likely to benefit most, the Pebble Mine in Alaska remains blocked due to environmental concerns. Labor shortages, inflationary pressures, higher electricity costs from AI data centers, and reduced tax incentives (due to OBBBA repealing IRA provisions) pose structural challenges. Demand uncertainty, especially for lithium and EVs, persists, with Ford being the only major automaker with aggressive EV targets. The policy mix creates a two-tier market: projects with government financial support face lower risk than those reliant solely on private demand. Despite risks, the administration\u2019s coordinated approach\u2014merging national security, trade, and investment policy\u2014aims to reduce dependence on foreign supply, particularly China, which controls 70% of global rare earth ore extraction and 90% of processing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 01:58 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/shovel-ready-building-us-critical-9969558/)\n\n**Wyden Blasts Republicans for Manufacturing Nationwide Energy Crisis | The United States Senate Committee on Finance**\nSenator Ron Wyden delivered a critical speech before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, condemning Republicans and former President Donald Trump for creating a manufactured nationwide energy crisis. Wyden argues that Trump's promise of 'energy dominance' was fraudulent, citing Trump's February 2025 executive order declaring an 'energy emergency'\u2014a move Wyden claims was designed to benefit Big Oil donors rather than strengthen U.S. energy security. He asserts that Republicans, under Trump\u2019s direction, dismantled key clean energy incentives by eliminating tax credits for wind and solar energy in their budget reconciliation bill\u2014credits passed in 2022 under Democratic leadership that had spurred hundreds of billions in private investment, created hundreds of thousands of jobs, and accelerated U.S. progress in clean energy manufacturing. Wyden notes that these actions reversed the U.S.'s rise from the middle of the global clean energy race to a leading position. He highlights that over $7 billion in clean energy project funding has been canceled, mostly in blue states, with Oregon alone losing over $400 million. Additionally, Republicans have blocked clean energy development on public lands and prioritized coal, which Wyden calls a 'gobsmacking attempt' to harm American families for campaign contributions. He warns that rising energy demand and utility costs now threaten affordability, and that the Republican agenda represents 'economic self-sabotage.' Wyden urges the Senate to support Senator Kaine\u2019s resolution to counter this crisis, emphasizing that the American people voted for lower prices, more jobs, and energy security\u2014not a crisis benefiting Big Oil.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 09:33 PM\nSource:[U.S. Senate Finance Committee](https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-blasts-republicans-for-manufacturing-nationwide-energy-crisis)\n\n**Clean hydrogen energy revolution is being hijacked by corporate greed, crony deals, and political shortsightedness   - NaturalNews.com**\nThe article argues that the clean hydrogen energy revolution is being undermined by corporate greed, political shortsightedness, and the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which undermines the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s 45V tax credit for clean hydrogen after 2027. This creates uncertainty for long-term investments, as hydrogen plant development takes 5\u201310 years. Currently, most hydrogen is produced via steam methane reforming (SMR), generating 'gray hydrogen' that is dirtier than coal. 'Blue hydrogen,' which uses carbon capture and storage (CCS), is also problematic due to high energy use, leakage, and poor performance\u2014e.g., Chevron\u2019s Gorgon project captured only 30% of emissions. 'Green hydrogen,' produced using renewable electricity, is the gold standard but requires massive infrastructure and renewable energy scaling\u201450-fold increase by 2030 per the IEA\u2014currently unattainable without a major push. Bio-hydrogen (Bio-H\u2082), made from agricultural waste and forest residues, is a viable near-term solution, cutting 1.8 to 5.5 kg CO\u2082 per kg of hydrogen and reducing wildfire risks. The 45V credit initially enabled Bio-H\u2082 and green hydrogen to compete with gray hydrogen, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases it out, while extending tax breaks for underperforming blue hydrogen projects. Experts like Yuan Yao (Yale) and Wei Peng (Princeton) criticize the policy as a 'ladder-pulling' strategy and a 'vape vs. cigarette' analogy, respectively. The article also highlights a misalignment in deployment: hydrogen is being used in inefficient applications like fuel tanks instead of high-emission sectors like steel production, where it could deliver massive emissions reductions. The Yale study recommends targeted subsidies for industrial use and allowing diverse clean technologies to compete, but asserts that political courage is lacking in Washington.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:05 PM\nSource:[NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-10-08-clean-hydrogen-energy-revolution-stifled-by-corporate-greed-politics.html)\n\n**Trump mulls canceling $1B in grants for GM, Stellantis projects**\nPresident Donald Trump is considering canceling over $1 billion in federal grants awarded to General Motors (GM) and Stellantis, including a $500 million grant to GM for converting its Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant to electric vehicle (EV) production. Additional grants targeted for cancellation include $335 million for Stellantis in Belvidere, Illinois, and $250 million for its Kokomo, Indiana, plant, though the Belvidere project was already scrapped in March 2025. Other projects on the list include $95 million to Dow Chemical for EV battery electrolyte solvents, $285 million to Mercedes-Benz in South Carolina, and $75 million to Cummins in Indiana. The list, obtained by The Detroit News and circulated on Capitol Hill, includes over $16 billion in Department of Energy projects across multiple states. The grants were awarded by the Biden administration in July 2024 but had not yet been finalized under the Trump administration, which opposes federal EV subsidies. Vice President JD Vance criticized the GM grant during the 2024 campaign, claiming funds would benefit China\u2019s EV industry. The Biden administration projected the GM grant would preserve over 650 jobs and create 50 new ones. The Department of Energy stated the awards have not been terminated, emphasizing an ongoing individualized review. The White House did not comment.

The program, part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established under the 2022 Democrat-backed climate law, was designed to provide solar energy access to over 900,000 lower-income Americans. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration\u2019s termination of the program\u2014following a July 2025 tax and spending law\u2014was illegal because the funds had already been awarded. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed the program lacked statutory authority and was a 'fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.' The plaintiffs assert that the cancellation undermines clean energy equity, kills jobs, and increases electricity prices. The program was projected to save beneficiaries $400 annually on energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The lawsuit is part of a broader legal challenge against the administration\u2019s rollback of clean energy initiatives, which also include the cancellation of $20 billion in climate funding, interference with offshore wind projects, and efforts to rescind the EPA\u2019s 'endangerment finding' and emissions reporting requirements. A federal judge previously ruled that some of the $20 billion funds must remain accessible, but an appeals court later upheld the administration\u2019s authority to terminate the funds.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[Daily Journal of Commerce](https://djcoregon.com/news/2025/10/07/solar-for-all-lawsuit-epa-trump-program-cancellation/)\n\n**The Left's energy amnesia**\nThe article argues that despite Democrats' climate goals, their energy policies have undermined energy affordability and reliability. It claims the fracking revolution, not cap-and-trade legislation, was responsible for lowering energy bills and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even achieving emissions targets without the bill passing. The piece criticizes Democratic policies under Obama and Biden for disrupting energy markets through subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline, reduced oil/gas lease sales, a methane tax, and premature closures of power plants via the Clean Power Plan 2.0, which would have banned natural gas baseload plants and mandated costly carbon capture. The article contends these regulations contradict basic economics by forcing compliance spending instead of productive investment, citing the broken window fallacy. It also highlights Democratic-driven electrification mandates and bans on fossil fuel use in homes and vehicles, which create regulatory uncertainty and delays. Despite growing Democratic support for permitting reform, the article asserts that delays have already worsened energy bottlenecks, particularly for renewables, solar, transmission, and pipelines\u2014where one pipeline\u2019s permitting cost reportedly exceeded its construction cost. The author urges permitting reform to stabilize energy policy, reduce dependency on bureaucratic discretion, and align with both energy dominance and climate goals. The piece concludes that energy success should be driven by market forces, not political cycles, and that reform is essential to avoid punishing consumers. The argument is attributed to Nick Loris, executive vice president of policy at C3 Solutions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:22 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3840507/energy-crisis-climate-agenda-permitting-reform/)\n\n**Why is the GOP adopting Democrats' worst energy ideas? | Opinion**\nMichael E. Webber, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, argues in an opinion piece published by the Houston Chronicle on October 7, 2025, that the Republican Party is adopting the worst energy policies from the Democratic Party's past, particularly those from the Carter administration. He criticizes the Trump administration for abandoning the 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy and instead arbitrarily canceling approved offshore wind projects\u2014such as one off Rhode Island that was nearly completed\u2014leading to costly delays. Onshore renewable projects are also hindered by new permitting hurdles and political reviews. Webber draws a parallel to the 1978 Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act, which banned new natural gas power plants, resulting in a decade of increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions due to the construction of dirtier coal plants. The ban was repealed in 1987, leading to a 'Dash for Gas' in the 1990s and 2000s. Now, Republicans are repeating this mistake by opposing wind and solar, promoting coal, and blocking new transmission lines\u2014policies that, like the Carter-era bans, will lead to higher electricity prices and reduced supply. Despite some support for nuclear and geothermal energy, these sources will not scale until the 2030s. Webber warns that this policy reversal risks a 1970s-style stagflation, with inflation and unemployment rising due to government-imposed energy constraints. He calls on Republicans to return to their core principles of market-driven energy abundance, especially as demand from AI data centers, electric vehicles, and new factories grows, and as Democrats under Biden have successfully expanded energy production across oil, gas, wind, and solar while reducing imports and emissions. 'If they don't, we'll all end up paying the price,' Webber concludes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Houston Chronicle](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/gop-adopting-democrats-worst-energy-ideas-21085599.php)\n\n**A tribe in Arizona planned to connect 600 homes to electricity. Then the funding was cut**\nThe Hopi Tribe in northeast Arizona planned to connect approximately 600 homes to electricity through the Solar for All program, which was funded under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and awarded the tribe a $25 million grant for solar panels and battery storage. However, in August 2024, the Trump administration terminated the Solar for All program, citing it as wasteful, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) ended tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or is not placed into service by December 31, 2027. As a result, the Hopi Tribe will now only be able to power around 100 homes through a smaller federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma expressed deep disappointment, stating, 'That's hard news to deliver, man,' after offering hope to residents. The tribe had also planned to build an 8-megawatt microgrid and a 400-megawatt solar project with battery storage\u2014projects that relied on IRA tax credits to cover up to half the cost. According to Pilar Thomas, a tribal energy attorney, the $7 billion in obligated grant funds cannot be rescinded by Congress. The EPA stated it no longer has authority to administer the program under the OBBB, but Thomas argues the funds were fully obligated. The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue to reinstate the Solar for All funds. The situation reflects a broader issue: an estimated 54,000 tribal members across Indian Country lack electricity access, and tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more frequently than the national average, a disparity rooted in historical exclusion from energy infrastructure development in the 1920s and 1930s. The loss of IRA funding also threatens economic recovery after the 2019 closure of the Navajo Generating Station, which had provided 85% of the Hopi\u2019s revenue and led to an unemployment rate of 12%, nearly three times the national average. The White House defended the rollback, claiming the administration is bringing down energy costs and ending a 'radical climate agenda' that shut down clean coal plants. Despite these setbacks, Nuvangyaoma affirmed, 'We have a heck of a plan... I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/07/nx-s1-5453913/trump-hopi-tribes-native-americans-clean-energy)\n\n**subsidised carbon emissions...**\nSubsidies for fossil fuel companies in the United States have doubled since 2017, now totaling $35 billion annually, according to a report by Oil Change International. Despite growing political rhetoric about the climate crisis, both the Trump and Biden administrations have expanded fossil fuel subsidies through legislation such as the GOP budget bill signed in July, which added nearly $40 billion in subsidies over ten years\u2014about $4 billion per year\u2014and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which included fossil fuel incentives despite Biden\u2019s campaign promise to end such subsidies. The report highlights that fossil fuel subsidies are often permanent, unlike renewable energy tax breaks, and include long-standing provisions like the deduction of intangible drilling costs, allowing companies to immediately deduct 100% of non-operational expenses. Additionally, billions in taxpayer money are funneled into carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, with government and independent estimates projecting potential tax credit costs of up to $3.6 trillion by 2050. These funds could instead support 3 million families with food assistance annually. Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International and report author, stated that the public costs of fossil fuel subsidies\u2014encompassing environmental degradation, health impacts, and climate damage\u2014far exceed any benefits to energy affordability. He called on Congress to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and redirect funds toward healthcare, housing, and clean, affordable renewable energy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[yourdemocracy.net](https://yourdemocracy.net/drupal/node/57014)\n\n**Return of Reason: Trump Administration Reverses Energy Policy \u2013 Unzensuriert**\nThe Trump administration has abruptly canceled nearly $8 billion in federal funding for so-called 'green' energy projects, marking a strategic shift away from the Biden-era climate agenda. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated the move ends the 'promotion of the left-wing climate agenda' and aims to ensure energy affordability, reliability, and national security. The decision halted 321 grants across 223 projects, primarily funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, which the administration claimed lacked economic and security justification. The affected projects were concentrated in Democratic-led states like California and New York, including inefficient carbon storage facilities and experimental decarbonization initiatives. In a parallel move, Wright announced a $625 million investment to revitalize the domestic coal industry, emphasizing the need for stable base-load power to prevent blackouts. The administration plans to add at least 100 gigawatts of secure power capacity within five years to support industrial renaissance and artificial intelligence leadership. This energy policy aligns with a broader foreign policy stance emphasizing national strength over globalist ideals, as articulated by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who called for a return to traditional American virtues. President Trump denounced climate change as 'the greatest lie in human history,' citing unfulfilled climate disaster predictions and the loss of millions of jobs in Europe despite reduced emissions, while China increased its output.

The IRA, signed by President Biden in 2022, was a significant climate law providing hundreds of billions of dollars for tax credits and programs to bolster the clean energy sector. The OBBBA also cuts billions in spending from clean energy programs under the law, eliminates credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles, and phases out tax credits for investment in and production of clean energy. However, some tax credits are still available for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal energy, energy storage, clean hydrogen, and carbon capture. Environmental activists and experts say that the repeal will create massive uncertainty in the market, making it difficult to make capital investments and projects.

The law, which Trump has dubbed 'grande et belle loi', eliminates most of the tax credits for renewable energy projects and energy-efficient appliances, which were introduced by Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. According to Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity, 'the projects of renewable energy are all at risk of failing completely' due to the elimination of these incentives. Su predicts that the increased demand for energy in the US will be met by the fossil fuel industry, leading to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Trump, who has been funded by the oil and gas industry, has promised to 'drill everywhere' and has taken several measures against renewable energy, including wind and solar power. The law also eliminates incentives for electric vehicles, which will expire in 2025, and for the installation of charging stations, which will expire in June 2026. Albert Gore of the Zero Emission Transportation Association says that the law will 'bury the goal of making the US competitive in the global markets for the production of minerals, batteries, and future vehicles'.

The bill's impact on battery manufacturing is particularly concerning, as the US is not well-equipped to make batteries domestically. The IRA had promoted domestic EV and battery manufacturing, but the bill's repeal of these provisions will likely lead to a decline in battery production and the loss of tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs. As a result, the US will continue to rely on China for its battery needs, which has significant implications for the country's energy independence and national security.

The bill would end the tax incentives for electric vehicles established by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and gradually phase out support for solar and wind power. However, tax incentives for nuclear, geothermal, and hydroelectric power, as well as battery storage, would remain in place. Richard Black, policy and strategy director at the UK think tank Ember, said, 'It is almost certain that this will slow down the introduction of renewable energy in the US.' As China is already leading the world in clean energy investment and innovation, the US government's decision to 'not compete' is seen as a mistake.

This legislation explicitly repealed, phased out, or materially restricted major IRA climate-related provisions, including eliminating or curtailing tax credits for clean energy (solar, wind, EVs), funding for climate initiatives, and various program eligibilities. \n\nEach expert, from fields as diverse as legislative affairs, environmental law, public policy, and political science, drew on both historical base rates of major legislative reversals during party control changes and an evaluation of the resolution criteria. They all recognize the OBBBA\u2019s clear statutory nature (as opposed to mere regulatory or appropriations changes) and confirmation through Congressional records and media coverage.\n\nWhile recurring lawsuits (e.g., over the Solar for All program) and minor ambiguities about appropriations or leftover program funds are noted, these are seen as insufficient to block or reverse the central statutory amendments before the January 1, 2026 deadline. The experts only allow for a minimal margin of uncertainty due to a remote possibility of overturning legislation via court action or an exceedingly technical resolution interpretation by Metaculus. Nonetheless, the convergence of evidence, the strength of the legislative action, and its explicit compliance with the clarifying criteria all lead to a strong consensus: the question is almost certain to resolve as Yes, given that a qualifying bill has been signed into law well within the resolution window.",
