However, the key intervening variable is the loss of the DFL endorsement. From a GOTV perspective, this robs Fateh\u2019s campaign of coordinated party resources, signals elite division, and creates openings for Frey to execute a rear-guard moderate strategy. Still, the pre-existing anti-incumbent energy, ranked-choice dynamic (greater progressive unity), and robust left coalition make Fateh a very strong contender, albeit not the near-certainty he would have been with a clean DFL endorsement. Factoring in all the above, the impact of demobilization/party confusion likely prevents this from being a >90% probability, but the structural wind remains at Fateh\u2019s back.

Rank-choice voting, the progressive national environment, and evidence of grassroots support (endorsed by labor and progressives, historic candidacy) are all positives for Fateh. The key uncertainties are whether the DFL fracture critically depresses Fateh\u2019s volunteer/fundraising advantage and whether dissatisfaction with Frey translates to a sufficient anti-incumbent vote. Given these, I view Fateh's chances as meaningfully better than the historical base rate for an incumbent, but the risk introduced by institutional disarray and loss of endorsement make near-certainty unwarranted.

While Fateh had strong momentum and major delegate support, losing the party's formal backing qua endorsement is a historic setback: it denies him institutional support and risks making the contest look less like a referendum on Frey and more like a far-left insurgency. However, the progressive energy from the Mamdani victory in NYC and Frey\u2019s markedly low favorability provide Fateh a plausible path, especially as the progressives are less divided than before. The absence of recent, credible public polling is a wildcard, but the baseline for incumbent mayors in Minneapolis is moderate advantage (60%). The vacated endorsement, lack of institutional party split toward Fateh, and prior electoral mechanics (Frey winning amid fractured opposition) push me toward a substantially less extreme probability than the status-quo before the endorsement was lost. But with strong progressive winds, a weak incumbent, and national currents, Fateh remains a highly viable contender.

Progressive/leftist momentum, visible both nationally (Mamdani in NYC) and locally, remains strong and could help Fateh capitalize on Frey\u2019s high unfavorability and the city\u2019s leftward drift. Ranked-choice voting introduces further uncertainty, particularly if progressive voters line up behind Fateh as lower-ranked choices.

Second, progressive consolidation among primary opponent groups is significantly higher than in past cycles\u2014reducing vote-splitting vulnerabilities. Third, while the loss of the DFL endorsement is a material organizational setback, the precedent of insurgent or non-endorsed progressives winning in Minneapolis (and contemporaneous urban races) should not be discounted, especially when anti-incumbent energy is high and campaign infrastructure can rely on highly networked activist/journalist spheres. Additionally, the RCV format can help Fateh if anti-incumbent votes switch preferences with little friction and there are few competitive centrists.

However, there was also clear, convergent recognition that the incumbent's extreme unpopularity, the city's progressive shift, reduced progressive vote-splitting, and the grassroots energy remain significant offsets. Critiques of the lowest probability forecasts (e.g. 17%), in particular, effectively highlighted that we are not in a standard 'incumbency advantage' cycle, but one with palpable anti-incumbent and progressive consolidation signals. On net, these deliberations clarify that Fateh is more probable than an even toss-up, but the loss of the DFL endorsement likely keeps his probability in the 60s range\u2014not in the 80s+ 'overwhelming likelihood' camp, nor as low as the 'longshot' scenarios. Given all the evidence and arguments, I revise my probability slightly downward by 3 points to better reflect the seriousness of the endorsement loss and resulting organizational headwinds.",

Past cycles (including in Minneapolis and peer cities) show that party chaos and resource loss make progressive insurgencies more vulnerable in close races, even in RCV environments. While the RCV system, city partisanship, and Frey's weak favorability still tilt the odds toward Fateh, scenarios in which he falters are sufficiently plausible and no longer require extreme shocks. The likelihood of Frey and establishment actors consolidating moderate votes, late negative media framing, or turnout drop-off among key Fateh blocs is now understood to be significant.

While others\u2014especially those emphasizing social identity, public polling, or urban sociology\u2014assign much higher probabilities due to progressive energy, RCV advantages, and anti-incumbent sentiment, these perspectives tend to underweight organizational and turnout risks deeply established in the literature. No new evidence or argument has emerged to suggest that Fateh's campaign has a clear, viable workaround for the loss of the DFL's field and data operations. While progressive enthusiasm remains tangible, the historical precedent for institutional losers is poor, and negative outlier polling for Frey is alone unlikely to overcome these operational hurdles.

However, some forecasters reasonably note that Frey's unprecedented net negative favorability, high-profile national progressive momentum, and less fractured left lane are unusual compared to past cycles; thus, the anti-incumbent and anti-machine energy should not be dismissed outright. The endorsement loss, however, is not a trivial setback but a severe operational liability for Fateh\u2014as supported by historical cases in Minneapolis and other urban machines. On balance, the risks that Fateh fails to convert support into turnout without unified backing outweigh the strengths of the energized progressive field.

However, several forecasters with respective expertise in GOTV, polling, and voter behavior hold that while anti-incumbent sentiment and progressive energy are unusually strong, they do not fully, or reliably, compensate for lost institutional support. Critiques of more optimistic forecasts astutely stress that historical incumbency advantage, DFL machine resources, and the adverse signaling to less engaged voters collectively maintain a higher baseline for the incumbent. Arguments for raising Fateh\u2019s probability (pointing to Frey's historic unpopularity and energized opposition) are persuasive only to a moderate degree, but lack hard evidence of a robust, substitute turnout operation capable of neutralizing DFL field effects. Furthermore, no new data or polling has emerged to alter the foundational calculus. Accordingly, I find no compelling reason to materially raise or lower my estimate. The incumbency advantage, now augmented by machine fallback and organizational disarray on the challenger side, still suggests Fateh is a significant underdog, but not a negligible longshot.",

While significant grassroots and progressive momentum persists, and the anti-incumbent/RCV dynamic remains strong, the balance of evidence suggests that a somewhat lower probability more accurately reflects Fateh\u2019s electoral pathways\u2014especially given the possibility of turnout suppression or confusion stemming from the endorsement implosion.

Multiple persuasive arguments (notably from GOTV modeling, polling standards, and machine theory perspectives) outlined how both turnout and organizational effectiveness may be more affected than I accounted for, particularly among lower-propensity and trust-dependent voters. The endorsement chaos not only removes access to key campaign infrastructure but creates a signal of instability that may deter undecided or marginal supporters and depress progressive momentum. Additionally, the lack of robust polling adds uncertainty and amplifies the possible negative impact of organizational confusion.

However, arguments from Urban Electoral Analysis and some campaign strategists highlight the unusually high anti-incumbent sentiment, consolidated progressive coalition, and strong identity-based mobilization that could partially counteract machine loss\u2014possibly placing the odds closer to a competitive contest than the 'near impossible' frame. Conversely, forecasts above 60% (and clearly 80%+) for Fateh appear statistically and historically unjustified, especially without recent polling evidence, precedent of such a sharp institutional reversal, or strong cross-racial coalition turnout guarantees. My original estimate arguably weighted machine/endorsement effects a little too heavily, given Minneapolis' contemporary electoral dynamism, but I also believe the denominator has not changed enough for a shift into 'tossup' territory. Therefore, I will modestly increase Fateh\u2019s odds, recognizing the city\u2019s openness to progressive insurgents and powerful identity coalitions, but retain significant skepticism given the organizational chaos and base rates.",

The original question opened on 2025-07-24 15:40:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/38922). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nWashington Post (July 24, 2025): [Is a Mamdani repeat coming to the Midwest? A democratic socialist is getting a boost in Minnesota.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/is-a-mamdani-repeat-coming-to-the-midwest-a-democratic-socialist-is-getting-a-boost-in-minnesota/ar-AA1JcfEP)\n\n> The Democratic Party in Minneapolis over the weekend endorsed a democratic socialist over the two-term incumbent in the city\u2019s mayoral race, the latest indicator of increased momentum for the progressive left in local races across the country.\n\n> Delegates of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota\u2019s most populous city on Saturday threw their support behind state Sen. Omar Fateh, who defeated Mayor Jacob Frey, at the party\u2019s convention. The endorsement comes less than a month after Zohran Mamdani, also a democratic socialist and state lawmaker, won the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York.\n\n> The mayoral race is a ranked-choice election, like in New York, and the general election will take place in November when all candidates will compete on the same ballot regardless of party affiliation. A Democrat is expected to win the race, as Minneapolis is a heavily Democratic city that has been led by Democratic mayors for more than 47 years.\n\n> While several candidates are running, the DFL endorsement effectively pits a democratic socialist against a relatively more moderate Frey. The mayoral race is far from over, according to political observers \u2014 but the endorsement does boost Fateh\u2019s profile. It also represents a major win for liberals, and is likely to draw national attention and money on the race.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st Century, incumbent mayors of Minneapolis have been re-elected 60% of the time: in 2021, 2009, 2005. Conversely, they have lost 40% of the time: in 2017 (to the current mayor, Jacob Frey) and in 2001.&#x20;\n\nAt the time of this question, there has been little public polling in the race. A poll from May 2025 [found](https://www.mplsforthemany.com/polling) Mayor Frey with -21% net favorability, which is 20 points worse than in September 2021, when Frey won the final round by 12.5 points against a progressive field that was divided into two main contenders, as compared with one (Fateh) in the 2025 election.&#x20;\n\nMayor Frey is also appealing his loss of the\u00a0Minneapolis Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party\u2019s endorsement, according to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5412323-minneapolis-mayor-frey-appeal-endorsement/).&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38922,\"question_id\":38271}}`",

According to a poll by AARP New\u202fYork\u2011Gotham Polling & Analytics, he leads with 41.8\u202f% voter intent, outpacing former governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent mayor Eric Adams.  Mamdani\u2019s platform is a democratic\u2011socialist agenda that includes a rent\u2011freeze and a higher minimum wage, and he has received endorsements from Bernie Sanders, Alexandria\u202fOcasio\u2011Cortez and the Working\u202fFamilies\u202fParty.  Critics argue that his fiscal proposals could trigger capital flight and reduce investment.  Fund\u2011raising figures show Cuomo raised more than $1.5\u202fmillion from Long Island, while Adams has exceeded $1\u202fmillion; Mamdani\u2019s campaign has raised less, relying mainly on progressive voters and marginalized communities.

Kathy Hochul's 2026 re\u2011election campaign, even after Hochul publicly supported him in a New\u202fYork\u202fTimes op\u2011ed. Mamdani told reporters his focus is 'on November,' and said, 'I'm excited to have the governor's support,' without committing to reciprocation. Hochul's endorsement came while other top Democrats, such as Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, have withheld public backing. Mamdani\u2019s platform includes raising the minimum wage to $30, opening state\u2011run grocery stores, and taxing what he calls 'richer and whiter' neighborhoods, prompting business owners to voice concerns and some to consider leaving the city. He has also been criticized for not condemning anti\u2011police slogans like 'globalize the intifada' and the phrase 'From the river to the sea'; he now says he 'discourages' the use of the latter only after pressure from Jewish leaders. The article argues that Hochul\u2019s endorsement signals a shift in the Democratic Party toward the far left and warns that her gamble could cost her political capital.

The endorsement followed a meeting between Mamdani and billionaire former mayor Michael\u202fBloomberg, who did not endorse him but met with him, according to the article. Hochul\u2019s endorsement broke a pattern of stone\u2011walling by senior Democrats, including Senators Chuck\u202fSchumer and Kirsten\u202fGillibrand and House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries. Mamdani is the frontrunner in a four\u2011way November\u202f4 election that also includes former Governor Andrew\u202fCuomo (running as an independent), incumbent Mayor Eric\u202fAdams (also independent) and Republican Curtis\u202fSliwa. House members Pat\u202fRyan, Gerry\u202fNadler, Senator Chris\u202fVan\u202fHollen and Representative Jamie\u202fRaskin have publicly endorsed Mamdani. Trump reacted to the endorsement with a threat, saying, 'This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New\u202fYork City. How can such a thing happen? Washington will be watching this situation very closely. No reason to be sending good money after bad!' The article also notes that Hochul\u2019s op\u2011ed in the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes emphasized police resources, quoting her as saying, 'I urged him to ensure that there is strong leadership at the helm of the N.Y.P.D. -- and he agreed.' It further describes Hochul as a right\u2011wing figure who has opposed driver\u2019s licenses for immigrant workers and deployed National Guard troops in subways. The piece portrays Bloomberg\u2019s meeting as cordial but not an endorsement, and claims that Mamdani has agreed to abandon certain rhetoric and will accept police presence, while warning that Trump may deploy the National Guard in New\u202fYork\u202fCity. The article is heavily political and sensational in tone.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 03:13 AM\nSource:[World Socialist](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/09/16/nkjc-s16.html)\n\n**Mamdani declines to immediately back NY Gov. Kathy Hochul's reelection after she offers him coveted endorsement**\nDemocratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, declined to endorse Gov. Kathy Hochul for a second term after she endorsed him for mayor. He said, 'My focus is on November,' and added, 'And I'm excited to have the governor's support in that fight for November as we make it clear that we can put the days of City Hall and Albany being at war in the past.' Hochul, a moderate Democrat, had endorsed him after weeks of hesitation, a move that has pressured other New York Democrats to support him. Mamdani's decision comes as Hochul faces potential challenges from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in the 2026 Democratic primary and from Republican Elise Stefanik in the general election. In a New York Times op\u2011ed, Hochul wrote, 'I do not see eye to eye on everything' with him but will stand together against those who attempt to tear us apart.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 12:46 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mamdani-declines-immediately-back-ny-004600459.html)\n\n**The Democratic Party is in fits over Mamdani's bid for NYC mayor. Republicans are loving it**\nDemocratic Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized his party\u2019s leadership for not endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, calling the stance 'spineless' and urging Democrats to support him. Mamdani, a 33\u2011year\u2011old self\u2011described democratic socialist, has drawn support from progressives but has been distanced by moderate Democrats and party leaders. Republican figures, including former President Donald Trump, have seized on the split, labeling Mamdani a communist and threatening to withhold federal funds. Democratic leaders such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have declined to endorse him, citing strategic considerations. Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani, while other New York representatives have split, with Rep. Tom Suozzi refusing endorsement and Rep. Pat Ryan supporting him. The divide echoes the earlier rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has defended Mamdani. National progressive groups and figures like Joseph Geevarghese and Abdul El\u2011Sayed have expressed frustration at the establishment\u2019s silence. Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia have linked Mamdani to the Democratic brand in their campaigns. The controversy is seen as a test of the Democratic Party\u2019s unity heading into the 2026 midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 09:54 PM\nSource:[My Northwest](https://mynorthwest.com/national/the-democratic-party-is-in-fits-over-mamdanis-bid-for-nyc-mayor-republicans-are-loving-it/4132150)\n\n**Mamdani Apologizes for Anti\u2011Police Remarks, Faces Mixed Reactions**\nOn September 15, 2025, New\u202fYork City mayoral candidate Zohran\u202fMamdani publicly apologized for earlier remarks that criticized the NYPD as \"racist, anti\u2011gay, and a major threat to public safety,\" according to a report by Epoch Times journalist Wang\u202fLiefei. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, had long advocated for police budget cuts since the 2020 death of George\u202fFloyd. The shift in his stance followed the July\u202f28, 2025 shooting in Midtown Manhattan, where gunman Shane\u202fTamura fired nearly 50 rounds, killing five people, including a fallen officer\u2014 the deadliest mass shooting in the city in 25\u202fyears. The incident prompted mixed reactions: some politicians praised his acknowledgment of the limits of police\u2011budget cuts, while former Governor Gavin\u202fNewsom criticized the change as inconsistent. Police union leader Patrick\u202fHendry demanded more than a verbal apology, calling for concrete actions to improve officer pay and working conditions. Mamdani now faces dual pressure\u2014to appease the 30,000\u2011plus NYPD workforce and to retain progressive voters\u2019 trust. Meanwhile, Governor\u202fHoch expressed support, saying, 'He should apologize. I think this is an appropriate response. He acknowledges the mistake and works to earn officers\u2019 respect, and I appreciate that.'

Mamdani\u2019s platform is a democratic\u2011socialist agenda that includes a rent\u2011freeze and a higher minimum wage, and he has received endorsements from Bernie Sanders, Alexandria\u202fOcasio\u2011Cortez and the Working\u202fFamilies\u202fParty.

Kathy Hochul's 2026 re\u2011election campaign, even after Hochul publicly supported him in a New\u202fYork\u202fTimes op\u2011ed. Mamdani told reporters his focus is 'on November,' and said, 'I'm excited to have the governor's support,' without committing to reciprocation. Hochul's endorsement came while other top Democrats, such as Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, have withheld public backing. Mamdani\u2019s platform includes raising the minimum wage to $30, opening state\u2011run grocery stores, and taxing what he calls 'richer and whiter' neighborhoods, prompting business owners to voice concerns and some to consider leaving the city. He has also been criticized for not condemning anti\u2011police slogans like 'globalize the intifada' and the phrase 'From the river to the sea'; he now says he 'discourages' the use of the latter only after pressure from Jewish leaders. The article argues that Hochul\u2019s endorsement signals a shift in the Democratic Party toward the far left and warns that her gamble could cost her political capital.

Hochul had endorsed him on Sunday, but Mamdani said 'My focus is on November, and I'm excited to have the governor's support in that fight for November.' The move drew criticism from Rep. Elise Stefanik, who tweeted 'Even Mamdani refuses to support Kathy Hochul less than 24 hours after she endorsed him!' and from campaign strategist Hank Sheinkopf, who said 'No good deed goes unpunished. Hochul looks weak.' Sheinkopf also claimed Mamdani and the Democratic Socialists of America are in charge. Asian Wave Alliance member Yiatin Chu added 'Hochul got played.' Hochul, who is the de facto leader of New York\u2019s Democratic Party, had previously joked about Canada and criticized Hamas. A Siena College poll released Tuesday showed Hochul leading Stefanik 52% to 27% among registered voters in a potential match\u2011up, though Republican sources questioned its validity.

The endorsement followed a meeting between Mamdani and billionaire former mayor Michael\u202fBloomberg, who did not endorse him but met with him, according to the article. Hochul\u2019s endorsement broke a pattern of stone\u2011walling by senior Democrats, including Senators Chuck\u202fSchumer and Kirsten\u202fGillibrand and House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries. Mamdani is the frontrunner in a four\u2011way November\u202f4 election that also includes former Governor Andrew\u202fCuomo (running as an independent), incumbent Mayor Eric\u202fAdams (also independent) and Republican Curtis\u202fSliwa.

It further describes Hochul as a right\u2011wing figure who has opposed driver\u2019s licenses for immigrant workers and deployed National Guard troops in subways. The piece portrays Bloomberg\u2019s meeting as cordial but not an endorsement, and claims that Mamdani has agreed to abandon certain rhetoric and will accept police presence, while warning that Trump may deploy the National Guard in New\u202fYork\u202fCity.

    "summary": "The forecasts regarding Omar Fateh\u2019s likelihood of being elected mayor of Minneapolis in 2025 reflect both optimism and caution, split primarily along the lines of how much weight is given to structural factors like incumbency and party endorsements, versus progressive/coalition momentum and the local/national political climate. \n\nSeveral experts (those specializing in Ranked Choice Voting Analytics, Urban Sociology, and Social Identity Theory) assign a high probability (80%-97%) to Fateh's election, citing the following positive indicators: strong progressive momentum in large cities, deep dissatisfaction with incumbent Frey (notably his net -21% favorability), Fateh\u2019s ability to consolidate the progressive vote under ranked-choice voting, and the mobilization of key urban demographics (particularly Somali, Muslim, Black, and younger voters). These forecasts emphasize Fateh\u2019s powerful identity-based appeal, national progressive enthusiasm (\"Mamdani effect\"), and Minneapolis\u2019s absence of a serious Republican challenge; some acknowledge the setback of the DFL endorsement loss, but see it as a surmountable or even galvanizing event.\n\nA second group (Public Opinion Polling Standards, Urban Electoral Analysis, Political Campaign Strategy/GOTV), while still leaning toward Fateh as the favorite (probabilities 65%-83%), caution that the vacated DFL endorsement is a serious blow. Without the DFL endorsement, Fateh may suffer from reduced access to organizational infrastructure, donor/labor support, and legitimacy among wavering or moderate Democrats. The continued incumbency advantage for Frey, even amid his low popularity, is also a constraining factor. These experts argue that Fateh still has structural and narrative advantages\u2014progressive consolidation, anti-incumbent sentiment, and a favorable electoral system\u2014but the race is neither a lock nor a landslide.\n\nConversely, a third group (experts in Voter Behavior Theory, Political Machine Theory, Incumbency Advantage, and Minority Representation) assign a substantially lower probability to Fateh (15%-21%). This group stresses that, despite Fateh\u2019s mobilization and progressive winds, the loss of the DFL\u2019s official support, historical incumbency base rates (incumbents win about 60% of the time), potential party and voter confusion, elite resistance, and dangers of fractured opposition create powerful headwinds. They argue that party chaos and the undercutting of logistical support may depress turnout and hand the advantage to Frey, especially in the absence of a seismic, coordinated anti-incumbent surge.\n\nAll experts agree Fateh is in a competitive position and benefited from the city\u2019s progressive mood and Frey\u2019s low approval, but they diverge most over the practical impact of the lost DFL endorsement and whether Fateh\u2019s coalition, absent party machinery, can mount sufficient turnout and overcome establishment resistance. The forecast range is broad: the most Fateh-favorable analysts see him as a strong favorite (near-certain victory), middle-ground analysts as a favored but not overwhelming frontrunner, and the most machine/incumbency-oriented see a clear but not insurmountable path to defeat (small chance of a Fateh victory).\n\nOn average, the expert consensus lands Fateh as a modest favorite to win, but with significant uncertainty and major downside risks due to the DFL endorsement being vacated and possible party disarray, despite historic negative sentiment toward the incumbent.",
