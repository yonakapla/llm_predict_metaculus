Such an action is the culmination of complex preparatory diplomacy, deep knowledge of the legal, procedural, and emotional context of sovereignty transfer, and requires understanding the incentives, constraints, and preferences of all involved parties. My expertise enables rigorous assessment of base rates for sovereign territorial negotiations between Western democracies, and how political process, red lines, and negotiation mechanics influence the visible outcomes.",

The modern era simply does not admit major, voluntary sovereignty transfers among NATO members, and every signal here is of entrenched resistance, not flexibility. Your diagnosis of reputational and alliance costs is especially persuasive: a formal negotiation, even the announcement thereof, would trigger a firestorm across the EU, NATO, and global legal regimes. These are not theoretical deterrents\u2014they are ironclad barriers. Anyone betting higher than your (justifiably) microscopic probability hasn\u2019t internalized the lessons of postwar international order or the binding power of legal norms and alliance cohesion.

Where diplomatic optimists might overrate the role of creative statecraft or backchannel momentum, you\u2019re right to zero in on the necessity for transparent, legal, and publicly announced negotiations to trigger this question. With every attempt straight-jacketed by constitutional and alliance commitments, and given the short time frame, even Trumpian pressure amounts to little more than diplomatic noise.

Only a truly seismic, identity-shattering catastrophe could alter that. Constructivists are right; even when raw power and money are brandished, the social context blocks the leap to negotiating a sovereignty transfer. All operational reporting, as you note, shows rigid reinforcement of these roles: Denmark as protector of the status quo, Greenland jealously guarding self-determination, and the EU and international law acting as a normative moat.

The statement, published on November 22, 2025, on the official websites of Sweden and Norway, emphasized that the conflict is not only about Ukraine\u2019s security but also about the security of Europe as a whole. The leaders pledged to maintain and expand sanctions and economic measures against Russia as long as the war continues. They highlighted Ukraine\u2019s consistent willingness to pursue peace, including its readiness for negotiations and work on a peace plan proposed by the U.S., while noting that Russia has not taken any steps toward ceasefire or peace efforts, instead continuing attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. Western leaders called for revisions to the U.S. 'peace plan' under President Donald Trump, which reportedly includes territorial concessions by Ukraine, financial support for reconstruction, gradual lifting of sanctions on Russia, and a long-term economic agreement between Moscow and Washington. The U.S. gave Ukraine until November 27, 2025, to accept the plan, threatening to halt weapons deliveries and intelligence sharing if rejected. The plan is set to be discussed at a meeting on November 23, 2025, in Geneva, involving EU, U.S., and Ukrainian representatives, including Andriy Yermak (head of the President\u2019s Office), Rustem Umerov (Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council), Kyrylo Budanov (Head of the Ukrainian General Staff), and Serhiy Kyslytsya (Deputy Foreign Minister). The joint statement was also signed by leaders of Germany, the UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Japan, and by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[Rus.Postimees.ee](https://rus.postimees.ee/8366508/rech-idet-o-bezopasnosti-evropy-lidery-vosmi-stran-v-tom-chisle-i-estonii-vystupili-s-sovmestnym-obrashcheniem)\n\n**Melih Alt\u0131nok: Otherwise, this war could last for years**\nAccording to a CBS News report cited by the BBC, U.S. President Donald Trump's 28-point Ukraine plan, pending a decision by Thursday, outlines the following: Russia will retain control over most of the occupied territories of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk, with these regions effectively recognized as Russian territory by the U.S.; Ukraine will abandon its constitutional NATO membership aspirations but remain open to EU membership; Ukraine\u2019s military size will be capped at 600,000 troops; elections delayed due to war will be held within 100 days; a recovery package will be launched for Ukraine\u2019s war-damaged economy, with approximately $100 billion in frozen Russian assets transferred to Ukraine; in return, Russia will begin negotiations to lift sanctions imposed since the invasion. If Russia re-occupies Ukraine, a 'determined and coordinated military intervention' and the resumption of sanctions will be triggered. The Kremlin has expressed approval, with Putin stating the U.S. peace plan could form the foundation of a final peace agreement and warning Kyiv that prolonging the war would lead to further territorial losses. Kyiv has reacted with outrage: President Zelenskiy, in a national address, rejected the plan, asserting Ukraine would not sacrifice its national interests and pledged to propose alternatives. Trump, viewing the war as a burden inherited from Biden, reportedly sees Zelenskiy as a 'nuisance' and calculates that ending the conflict could grant the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s resources (minerals, fertile land). Zelenskiy, aware that military success without U.S. support is unlikely and cognizant of corruption scandals involving figures with ties to London, recognizes Putin\u2019s strategic use of the war to consolidate power\u2014suggesting the conflict could drag on for years. His future decisions will prioritize self-preservation over Ukraine\u2019s territorial future. Regardless of debates over who started the war or issues of justice, the concrete realities on the eastern front remain unchanged: no new developments in the eastern theater.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[A Haber](https://www.ahaber.com.tr/yazarlar/melih-altinok/2025/11/23/yoksa-bu-savas-yillarca-surer)\n\n**USA Attempted to Arrange High-Level Meeting with Greenland's Prime Minister Without Denmark**\nThe White House has not commented on a report by Politiken revealing that the United States has attempted to arrange high-level meetings with representatives from Greenland without Denmark's involvement.

The standard practice requires both Denmark and Greenland to be present when foreign, security, and defense policies affecting Greenland are discussed. However, the U.S. has reportedly sought direct dialogue, citing Greenland\u2019s strategic importance. In a written response, the White House stated that President Trump believes Greenland would be better protected against modern threats in the Arctic region under U.S. security guarantees. This follows renewed attention to Trump\u2019s interest in purchasing Greenland, which emerged nearly a year prior during his first presidential term.

This stance comes amid growing Western efforts to reduce dependency on Chinese supply chains, especially as China has weaponized critical minerals. Nielsen emphasized that China is 'not within our consideration' and that Gr\u00f8nland has not received any investment requests from Chinese companies nor intends to consider China as a future partner. He highlighted the importance of strengthening ties with allies, noting that 'we need the EU, and the EU needs Gr\u00f8nland.' The EU has already begun developing mineral projects in Gr\u00f8nland, with the European Commission identifying most critical minerals as present on the island. Gr\u00f8nland's strategic Arctic location has heightened global interest, particularly due to China\u2019s Polar Silk Road initiative and Russia\u2019s growing influence in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously expressed interest in purchasing Gr\u00f8nland, citing national security and economic reasons. Although Nielsen affirmed Gr\u00f8nland will never be sold, he called for deeper cooperation with the U.S., including potential expansion of American military presence. Experts like Professor Marc Lanteigne from the Arctic University of Norway note Gr\u00f8nland holds vast reserves of rare earth elements, uranium, precious metals, and strategic minerals. Companies such as Critical Metals and Amaroq are actively developing resources, with Amaroq discovering commercially viable deposits of germanium and gallium in western Gr\u00f8nland\u2014materials vital for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and military technology.

This is Trump\u2019s 'obsession' with Greenland**\nThe article from TVN24, published on October 21, 2025, reports that despite a period of silence from Donald Trump regarding his interest in acquiring Greenland, his obsession with the territory remains undiminished. According to Politico, high-ranking Danish officials believe Trump is still determined to become the first U.S. president since Andrew Johnson in 1867 to significantly expand American territory. Although recent agreements on defense and trade have improved transatlantic relations, Greenland could become the central flashpoint of a second Trump administration's foreign policy. Danish officials warn that Trump's fixation\u2014described as irrational yet genuine\u2014poses a serious threat to international norms of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The article notes that Greenland's strategic value is not backed by immediate security threats from Russia or China, and American investors have shown little interest in its mineral resources. However, Danish authorities suspect that Trump\u2019s ambitions stem from a symbolic desire to claim land he views as part of America\u2019s manifest destiny. The U.S. president\u2019s approach is also reportedly extended to Canada, though annexing a population of 40 million is seen as impractical. In contrast, Greenland\u2019s population of 56,000 and its 80% ice coverage make it a more feasible target. Trump reportedly claimed, 'I\u2019m sure Denmark will agree,' without consulting Greenland\u2019s Inuit majority, 89% of whom are Inuit, and 85% of whom rejected U.S. sovereignty in a January poll. Intelligence reports suggest U.S. agencies have been identifying potential pro-Trump Greenlanders, and in August, Denmark summoned a senior U.S. diplomat over allegations of three Americans linked to Trump conducting covert operations on the island. Danish officials believe the U.S. strategy may involve economic pressure\u2014either direct payments to residents or influence campaigns targeting local politicians\u2014rather than military invasion. The article emphasizes that Denmark fears a slow, economic takeover could go unnoticed by Brussels and EU partners. The Danish government is seeking broader European support, especially from Berlin and EU institutions, to strengthen Greenland\u2019s security and promote sustainable economic development. Greenland remains under Danish sovereignty but retains European Union citizenship for its residents, allowing access to both systems. The article warns that a Trump-led takeover would likely bring exploitative American investments that disregard Inuit culture, citing Alaska\u2019s treatment of Indigenous people as a cautionary example. Ultimately, Politico concludes that a transatlantic conflict over Greenland may be inevitable, and that if Trump succeeds in pressuring Denmark, other nations may follow suit in challenging international borders.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 01:27 PM\nSource:[TVN24](https://tvn24.pl/biznes/ze-swiata/grenlandia-i-donald-trump-to-ma-byc-obsesja-prezydenta-usa-nie-spodziewaja-sie-inwazji-wojskowej-st8711691)\n\n**PolitiCo: Denmark Still Fears Trump\u2019s Ambitions to Annex Greenland**\nAccording to Politico, Danish authorities remain deeply concerned about the possibility that former U.S. President Donald Trump may seek to annex Greenland, making him the first U.S. president since Andrew Johnson\u2019s acquisition of Alaska in 1867 to significantly expand U.S. territory. Copenhagen is alarmed that some European Union and NATO allies do not fully grasp the severity of the threat Trump\u2019s fixation on Greenland poses to U.S. relations, international respect for sovereignty, and border integrity.

Key deposits include the Ilimaussaq Complex (over 11 million tons of rare earth oxide equivalent, TREO >1.5%), the Kringlerne (Killavaat Alannguat) deposit rich in light and heavy rare earths, and the Tanbreez deposit (over 4 million tons of REOs), now owned by Critical Metals Corp. The Kvanefjeld project, rich in neodymium, dysprosium, and uranium, remains on hold due to Greenland\u2019s 2021 uranium mining ban. Energy Transition Minerals (ETM), an Australian firm, is pursuing $11.5 billion in compensation through international arbitration against Greenland and Denmark, arguing the ban constitutes expropriation under investment agreements. Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark since 2009, controls most domestic affairs including natural resources, while Denmark manages foreign policy and defense. Despite U.S. President Trump\u2019s public statements about acquiring Greenland 'one way or another'\u2014though not explicitly committing to military action\u2014U.S. foreign aid has been reallocated under the 'America First' initiative, with $400 million earmarked for Greenland\u2019s economic development and conservation. The EU has made tangible progress, securing a 30-year mining permit for a Danish-French consortium for anorthosite mining, signaling stronger alignment with European interests. Greenland\u2019s exports are dominated by seafood (over 80%), valued at $1.36 billion in July 2025, with major import partners including Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and Canada. Greenlanders hold mixed views on mining, with concerns over environmental risks, especially uranium contamination, and cultural preservation. The government maintains sovereign control over resources and emphasizes negotiation of royalties, environmental safeguards, and local employment. As of October 2025, the Tanbreez Project is progressing toward mining operations by end of 2028, pending submission of plans and financial guarantees. Despite geopolitical tensions and foreign interest from the U.S., EU, and China, Greenland\u2019s strategic importance lies in its vast REM potential, its role in the energy transition, and its complex balance between sovereignty, environmental stewardship, and economic development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:36 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/hot-topics-in-international-trade-8821163/)\n\n**U.S. State Department: Respect Greenlanders' Right to Decide Their Own Future**\nOn August 27, 2025, U.S. charg\u00e9\u2011d\u2019affaires in Denmark Mark Stroh met with Danish and Greenlandic officials after Danish intelligence warned that U.S. citizens were attempting to influence Greenland\u2019s political direction.

    "summary": "All expert forecasters, each with different disciplinary backgrounds (diplomacy, geopolitical risk, various branches of international relations and law, and Nordic studies), converge on an extremely low probability (between 1% and 2%) that the United States and Denmark will publicly announce formal negotiations over the possible transfer of Greenland\u2019s sovereignty to the US before January 1, 2026. Their analyses stress several shared factors: (1) deep constitutional, legal, and procedural barriers in Denmark and Greenland, including the necessity of joint Danish-Greenlandic participation, public approval, and legislative hurdles; (2) persistent and overwhelming opposition among both Danish and Greenlandic publics and elites, with preferences in Greenland running far more toward independence than US integration; (3) recent and repeated US attempts (primarily under Trump) to open dialogue or exert influence have been rebuffed by both Copenhagen and Nuuk, especially efforts that bypass Denmark; (4) no precedent in the modern era, post-World War II, exists for territorial transfer negotiations between Western democracies except in the context of decolonization or with clear local consent. While all forecasters acknowledge strong US strategic interest, especially due to Arctic resource and security concerns, they find no evidence or news of any shift toward official, public negotiation\u2014especially given heightened EU/NATO solidarity, postcolonial sensitivities, and prevailing international norms. All scenarios that would result in a Yes outcome (public, mutual announcement) require highly unlikely political shocks, dramatic reversals of current norms, or catastrophic strategic crises, none of which show signs of developing. With only about a month to a little over a year remaining before question closure, all experts agree the probability is effectively negligible and no public announcement of sovereignty negotiations is expected.",
