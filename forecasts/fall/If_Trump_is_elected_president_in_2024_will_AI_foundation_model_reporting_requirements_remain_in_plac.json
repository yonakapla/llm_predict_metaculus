At most, limited voluntary or contractually required risk assessments remain in specific contexts (e.g., for contractors or CBRN applications), but these do not reach the federal, comprehensive reporting threshold of the original order. There is no indication Congress or agencies have acted in the interim to reinstantiate such requirements. Based on historical base rates, the combination of aggressive executive deregulatory action and lack of legislative pressure makes the persistence of reporting requirements highly unlikely.

Replacement initiatives (AI Action Plan) are focused on deploying infrastructure, tracking exports, and restricting access to China\u2014not on broad domestic reporting, safety, or transparency for dual-use AI. There is no indication that Congress has required new reporting via statute, nor any credible evidence that lingering requirements remain enforceable at the end of 2025 absent administrative inertia or legal intervention. The main countervailing possibilities\u2014residual agency rules or rapid security-driven re-imposition of targeted reporting\u2014are both unlikely to cover the broad, continuous, and multi-point reporting specified in the resolution criteria. Small pockets of reporting specific to export controls or contract conditions may persist but will not satisfy the quantitative and qualitative requirements for a 'Yes.' National security or administrative lag might have preserved a narrow fragment of the requirements, but the dominant political and regulatory momentum, plus the comparative value placed by the Trump administration on deregulation and acceleration, make that scenario unlikely. Therefore, the base rate for rapid reversal of a predecessor administration's major executive order, absent statutory or overwhelming security imperatives, is exceptionally high. The forecast must reflect strong confidence that, as of December 31, 2025, broad AI reporting requirements for dual-use foundation models will not be in place.",

Although national security concerns about China are growing, they are being addressed through export controls and large-scale investment, not reimposition of domestic model training reporting requirements. While catastrophic events could force a policy reversal and there is some ongoing voluntary, sectoral, and export-oriented tracking, there is little evidence that any federal regulation in place at end-2025 will meet or exceed the comprehensive requirements set by EO 14110 for all companies training large dual-use models.

Legislative action is also highly improbable: the Congressional pipeline remains gridlocked, and even at the state level, initiatives have floundered or been vetoed. Private sector or voluntary standards are insufficient to qualify, and plausible 'policy drift' (in which agencies informally retain reporting) cannot override the clear executive agenda and high priority given to removing regulatory barriers. Under punctuated equilibrium theory, major shocks\u2014here, a presidential change and new perceived strategic crisis\u2014enable powerful stakeholders (industry, defense hawks, deregulatory officials) to rapidly dismantle the old policy regime and install a new one, leading to a sharp, low-probability tail for regulatory survival.

According to Sexton, this initiative\u2014described as 'the most important and secretive national project since the original Manhattan Project'\u2014was launched under President Trump's administration following urgent intelligence warnings that China could achieve ASI first, potentially enabling control over the global economy and warfare. Sexton states that Trump dismantled Biden's Executive Order 14110 on day one of his term and replaced it with a new directive accelerating AI research, which he estimates will inject $2.2 trillion into the U.S. economy over the next decade. The program, he says, will expand semiconductor production, build national-scale AI infrastructure, and fund advanced defense systems, including 'The Golden Dome,' an automated missile shield capable of neutralizing hypersonic and nuclear threats. Sexton cites conversations with top officials including Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, and David Sacks, stating they share a sense of urgency: 'There is zero time to waste. China is right on our heels. And if we don't act fast... we lose.' He warns that China may already possess over a million AI-powered drones, with a capacity to produce 500,000 per month, framing the race as existential. Sexton concludes that 'Manhattan II' represents America's last chance to reclaim its technological and military edge. Sexton, who once briefed President George W. Bush and was hand-picked to co-host a top-rated radio program with over 15 million followers, presents himself as a high-level insider with access to classified-level information.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/01/3178745/0/en/Former-CIA-Officer-Buck-Sexton-Pulls-Back-the-Curtain-on-Manhattan-II.html)\n\n**\"Manhattan II\"  --  Former CIA Officer Buck Sexton Exposes the Hidden Race With China**\nFormer CIA officer Buck Sexton warns of a critical global race for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which he labels 'Manhattan II,' in a press release published on October 31, 2025. According to Sexton, the United States is now engaged in a high-stakes technological arms race with China, comparable in scale to the original Manhattan Project. He asserts that whoever achieves ASI first will gain permanent global dominance in military, economic, and geopolitical power. Sexton criticizes former President Biden for issuing Executive Order 14110, which he claims stifled AI innovation by imposing excessive regulations on top scientists. In contrast, he praises President Trump for immediately repealing the order on his first day back in office and launching a new, aggressive initiative. The 'Manhattan II' project is estimated to involve $2.2 trillion in funding, distributed as follows: $500 billion for AI infrastructure and data networks, $280 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, $175 billion for an AI-powered defense shield, and $1.4 trillion for advanced energy systems. Sexton claims China is already operating at wartime production speed, capable of manufacturing 500,000 AI-powered drones per month, with over a million already deployed. He warns that China is leveraging American technology to threaten U.S. national security. Sexton frames the race as America\u2019s 'last chance' to reclaim global leadership and secure its future. He positions 'Manhattan II' as a pivotal moment for America\u2019s economic and military revival through innovation. Buck Sexton, a former CIA counter-terrorism officer who debriefed President George W.

Sanders, in their book *Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship*, explore the dual potential of artificial intelligence to either strengthen or undermine democracy. The authors argue that AI is already deeply embedded in democratic processes worldwide, with notable examples including the first AI-generated political party in Denmark (2022), South Korea\u2019s use of AI avatars in presidential campaigns (2022), Brazil\u2019s first AI-written law (2023), U.S. federal court judges using AI to interpret legal language (2024), and over 2,000 AI use cases disclosed by the Biden administration (2024). While some applications are experimental or symbolic, they signal a broader shift in governance. The authors warn that AI will first be adopted in areas with minimal public oversight, as government actors often use AI independently without permission. They highlight that AI inherently concentrates power\u2014both in authoritarian regimes and in democratic institutions\u2014by enabling elites to control automated systems more easily than human bureaucracies. However, they also emphasize that AI can be a tool for democratization: grassroots candidates in the 2024 U.S. election used AI for personalized outreach, and labor organizers employ AI to support worker safety reporting and union advocacy. The ultimate impact of AI on democracy depends on human choices. The authors call for four key actions\u2014Reform, Resist, Responsibly Use, and Renovate (the '4 Rs')\u2014to ensure AI serves the public interest through transparency, guardrails against misuse, and systemic updates to democratic institutions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 11:08 AM\nSource:[Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/will-ai-strengthen-or-undermine-democracy.html)\n\n**Trump Launches AI Action Plan to Secure U.S. Tech Supremacy Amid Global Competition**\nOn July 23, 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order launching the 'America's AI Action Plan,' a strategic initiative aimed at strengthening America's global leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). The plan, centered on deregulation, infrastructure expansion, and diplomatic outreach, outlines three key goals: accelerating innovation, building infrastructure, and leading in international AI development. It seeks to streamline the construction of AI data centers by eliminating regulatory barriers, ensuring sufficient energy supply, and directing federal agencies like the FTC and FCC to identify and remove rules hindering AI progress. The administration also targets 'woke' and 'biased AI' by proposing to bar such entities from receiving federal contracts. Trump declared, 'America must once again become a country that gives innovators the green light, not one that suffocates them with red tape,' asserting that the U.S. will win the AI race. This marks a strategic shift from the Biden administration\u2019s 'high guardrails' approach to a lighter regulatory model focused on innovation. The plan incorporates industry input from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft, which have long lobbied for faster data center deployment and reduced regulatory friction. However, implementation faces challenges, including inter-agency coordination, state and local government support, and unresolved legal questions\u2014particularly regarding the use of copyrighted materials in AI training, which remains legally uncertain. While Trump emphasized the need for clear guidelines to prevent U.S. companies from being at a disadvantage compared to Chinese firms, the administration acknowledges that such issues cannot be resolved solely through executive action. The U.S. is pursuing a dual strategy: promoting a global 'AI alliance' by exporting AI solutions (models, chips, applications) to allied nations while restricting China\u2019s access to advanced AI infrastructure through semiconductor export controls and tracking mechanisms. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and agencies like the Export-Import Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) are being leveraged to expand American AI influence abroad. The rise of China\u2019s open-source AI model DeepSeek in early 2025\u2014offering high performance at lower cost\u2014has alarmed U.S. officials, who fear that widespread adoption of Chinese AI models could erode America\u2019s competitive edge, especially as private U.S. models require significant investment in chips and infrastructure. The U.S. is thus using trade negotiations to loosen export restrictions while advancing its AI dominance strategy.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 02:59 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/topic/newsworld/205/202510310005.aspx)\n\n**Pentagon readying thousands of Guard \u2018reaction forces\u2019 as U.S. mission widens | Military | unionleader.com**\nThe Pentagon is preparing a new 'quick reaction force' within the National Guard, consisting of 23,500 personnel across all 50 states and three territories (excluding D.C.), to be trained and equipped for civil unrest response by January 1, 2026. The force, drawn primarily from personnel trained in disaster response\u2014including nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological incidents\u2014will be ready to deploy within eight hours, with full operational capability in one day. The initial 200 troops will come from the Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Assistance Support Element, with training including riot-control tactics, use of Tasers and pepper spray, and each unit required to carry 100 sets of crowd-control gear. This initiative, announced in August 2025, expands the existing National Guard Reaction Force, which has operated for about two decades but is now being restructured for broader domestic deployment. The move reflects President Donald Trump\u2019s broader effort to deploy military forces into urban centers, including D.C., Los Angeles, Memphis, and potentially Chicago and Portland, Oregon\u2014though the latter deployments have been delayed by court rulings. Trump has asserted broad authority to deploy active-duty troops domestically, claiming such actions are necessary to 'have safe cities,' despite legal restrictions on military law enforcement roles except under the Insurrection Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has requested additional briefs on the Chicago deployment dispute, pushing a decision to mid-November 2025. Critics, including Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, warn that federalizing the National Guard and expanding domestic military roles undermines constitutional checks and balances, erodes the military\u2019s core mission, and risks institutional decay due to Congress\u2019s lack of oversight. The Pentagon has not responded to requests for comment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 05:53 PM\nSource:[unionleader.com](https://www.unionleader.com/news/military/pentagon-readying-thousands-of-guard-reaction-forces-as-u-s-mission-widens/article_86bb4ef6-29dd-4a2d-b919-bcb880f2f645.html)\n\n**Former CIA Officer Buck Sexton Pulls Back the Curtain on \"Manhattan II\"**\nFormer CIA counter-terrorism officer Buck Sexton claims in a newly released interview that the U.S. government is secretly pursuing 'Manhattan II,' a top-priority national project aimed at securing American dominance in Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

The updated guidance reaffirms that AI must always be used with a human in the loop and only to assist, not replace, journalists. Any use of AI in reporting must be clearly labeled, including a description of how it was applied. The document expands on permissible uses outside core journalism, such as personalizing website content and recommending stories based on user behavior, citing MIT Sloan\u2019s definition of machine learning. It warns that generative AI is unsuitable for core writing and editing due to inherent flaws: reliance on training data, bias (racial and gender), hallucinations, factual errors, and sycophantic behavior\u2014where AI validates user emotions or impulses, raising safety concerns. The guidance cautions even on benign tools like voice-to-text transcription and grammar checkers, noting they can introduce errors or subtly alter meaning. It also prohibits using AI tools on unpublished or unedited content without legal clearance, due to potential rights waivers. The update reflects lessons from the journalism community, including the 2025 Pulitzer Prize requirement for AI disclosure, which enables transparency in top-tier reporting. Examples include the New York Times\u2019 2023 Pulitzer-winning investigation using AI to identify bomb craters in Gaza from satellite imagery. Despite AI\u2019s benefits\u2014such as rapid data processing and pattern recognition\u2014risks remain, highlighted by Anthropic\u2019s 2025 study showing large language models exhibiting 'malicious insider behaviors' under stress, a finding echoed with alarm by the New York Post. The updated guidelines underscore the necessity of strict guardrails to maintain journalistic integrity and public trust.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 09:38 AM\nSource:[The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/standards-editor/article-the-globe-has-updated-its-newsroom-ai-guidelines/)\n\n**\"Manhattan II\"  --  Former CIA Officer Buck Sexton Exposes the Hidden Race With China**\nFormer CIA officer Buck Sexton warns of a critical global race for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which he labels 'Manhattan II,' in a press release published on October 31, 2025.

The RUAIH framework outlines seven core principles: (1) AI Policies and Governance Structures, recommending multidisciplinary oversight integrated with existing compliance and patient safety systems; (2) Patient Privacy and Transparency, emphasizing AI-specific protections including model transparency and vendor accountability; (3) Data Security and Data Use Protections, requiring consistent application of security standards to AI tools via technical and contractual safeguards; (4) Ongoing Quality Monitoring, treating AI tools as dynamic systems needing continuous oversight; (5) Voluntary Reporting of AI Safety-Related Events, encouraging confidential reporting similar to other patient safety incidents; (6) Workforce Training and User Education, highlighting the need for staff to understand AI risks and responsibilities; and (7) Bias Mitigation and Algorithmic Fairness, implicitly required through the framework\u2019s emphasis on accountability and equity. The guidance is currently voluntary but is expected to inform future accreditation and certification pathways. The Joint Commission and CHAI plan to release AI governance playbooks in late 2025 and early 2026, followed by a voluntary AI certification program for over 22,000 accredited healthcare organizations nationwide. The framework aims to help organizations harness AI\u2019s transformative potential\u2014such as improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing clinician workload, and optimizing administrative tasks\u2014while mitigating risks like data breaches, algorithmic bias, and lack of transparency. According to the guidance, organizations should begin documenting AI oversight policies, governance structures, validation procedures, and staff training to prepare for future accreditation standards.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 03:50 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/joint-commission-and-coalition-for-4447578/)\n\n**Trump Launches AI Action Plan to Secure U.S. Tech Supremacy Amid Global Competition**\nOn July 23, 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order launching the 'America's AI Action Plan,' a strategic initiative aimed at strengthening America's global leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). The plan, centered on deregulation, infrastructure expansion, and diplomatic outreach, outlines three key goals: accelerating innovation, building infrastructure, and leading in international AI development. It seeks to streamline the construction of AI data centers by eliminating regulatory barriers, ensuring sufficient energy supply, and directing federal agencies like the FTC and FCC to identify and remove rules hindering AI progress. The administration also targets 'woke' and 'biased AI' by proposing to bar such entities from receiving federal contracts. Trump declared, 'America must once again become a country that gives innovators the green light, not one that suffocates them with red tape,' asserting that the U.S. will win the AI race. This marks a strategic shift from the Biden administration\u2019s 'high guardrails' approach to a lighter regulatory model focused on innovation. The plan incorporates industry input from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft, which have long lobbied for faster data center deployment and reduced regulatory friction. However, implementation faces challenges, including inter-agency coordination, state and local government support, and unresolved legal questions\u2014particularly regarding the use of copyrighted materials in AI training, which remains legally uncertain. While Trump emphasized the need for clear guidelines to prevent U.S. companies from being at a disadvantage compared to Chinese firms, the administration acknowledges that such issues cannot be resolved solely through executive action. The U.S. is pursuing a dual strategy: promoting a global 'AI alliance' by exporting AI solutions (models, chips, applications) to allied nations while restricting China\u2019s access to advanced AI infrastructure through semiconductor export controls and tracking mechanisms. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and agencies like the Export-Import Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) are being leveraged to expand American AI influence abroad. The rise of China\u2019s open-source AI model DeepSeek in early 2025\u2014offering high performance at lower cost\u2014has alarmed U.S. officials, who fear that widespread adoption of Chinese AI models could erode America\u2019s competitive edge, especially as private U.S. models require significant investment in chips and infrastructure. The U.S. is thus using trade negotiations to loosen export restrictions while advancing its AI dominance strategy.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 02:59 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/topic/newsworld/205/202510310005.aspx)\n\n**Pentagon readying thousands of Guard \u2018reaction forces\u2019 as U.S. mission widens | Military | unionleader.com**\nThe Pentagon is preparing a new 'quick reaction force' within the National Guard, consisting of 23,500 personnel across all 50 states and three territories (excluding D.C.), to be trained and equipped for civil unrest response by January 1, 2026. The force, drawn primarily from personnel trained in disaster response\u2014including nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological incidents\u2014will be ready to deploy within eight hours, with full operational capability in one day. The initial 200 troops will come from the Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Assistance Support Element, with training including riot-control tactics, use of Tasers and pepper spray, and each unit required to carry 100 sets of crowd-control gear. This initiative, announced in August 2025, expands the existing National Guard Reaction Force, which has operated for about two decades but is now being restructured for broader domestic deployment. The move reflects President Donald Trump\u2019s broader effort to deploy military forces into urban centers, including D.C., Los Angeles, Memphis, and potentially Chicago and Portland, Oregon\u2014though the latter deployments have been delayed by court rulings. Trump has asserted broad authority to deploy active-duty troops domestically, claiming such actions are necessary to 'have safe cities,' despite legal restrictions on military law enforcement roles except under the Insurrection Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has requested additional briefs on the Chicago deployment dispute, pushing a decision to mid-November 2025. Critics, including Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, warn that federalizing the National Guard and expanding domestic military roles undermines constitutional checks and balances, erodes the military\u2019s core mission, and risks institutional decay due to Congress\u2019s lack of oversight. The Pentagon has not responded to requests for comment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 05:53 PM\nSource:[unionleader.com](https://www.unionleader.com/news/military/pentagon-readying-thousands-of-guard-reaction-forces-as-u-s-mission-widens/article_86bb4ef6-29dd-4a2d-b919-bcb880f2f645.html)\n\n**Washington Invests $80 Billion to Build New Nuclear Reactors Amid AI-Driven Energy Demand**\nThe U.S. government plans to invest at least $80 billion in constructing new conventional nuclear reactors through a partnership with Westinghouse Electric Company, marking a major step in the revival of nuclear energy in the United States. This initiative is driven by surging electricity demand from data centers, particularly due to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The agreement builds on a May 2023 executive order by former President Donald Trump, which aimed to have ten new conventional reactors under construction by 2030. The partnership reflects Trump\u2019s vision of energy sovereignty, high-quality job creation, and positioning the U.S. as a leader in the nuclear renaissance. The U.S. had not started a new nuclear power plant since 2009, largely due to public distrust following accidents at Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986), and Fukushima (2011), as well as concerns over cost overruns and project delays. The invasion of Ukraine further disrupted energy markets, prompting diversification efforts. The project includes a mechanism for the U.S. government to receive 20% of profits above a certain threshold and the right to compel Westinghouse to go public if its valuation reaches $30 billion by 2029. Westinghouse, controlled by Brookfield Corporation with a minority stake held by Canadian uranium giant Cameco, offers two reactor models: the AP1000 (already licensed and in use) and the AP300, a small modular reactor (SMR) still undergoing regulatory approval. According to Professor Jacopo Buongiorno, the AP1000 is the most viable option for rapid deployment. In addition to new reactors, existing plants are being revived: Google has partnered with NextEra Energy to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa by early 2029, following similar reopenings of Palisades in Michigan (2023) and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania (2024). Experts emphasize that government involvement is critical in the early stages of expanding nuclear capacity.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 11:39 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2202865/etats-unis-80-milliards-construction-reacteurs-nucleaires)\n\n**US enters $80 billion nuclear partnership to power AI expansion**\nThe Trump administration has launched an $80 billion 'strategic partnership' to expand nuclear power generation in the United States, aiming to support artificial intelligence (AI) deployment. Announced on October 28, 2025, by Brookfield Asset Management in collaboration with Westinghouse Electric Company and Cameco Corporation, the initiative anticipates the construction of 'at least $80 billion of new reactors' across the U.S. The announcement aligns with President Trump\u2019s May 2025 executive order to have 10 'new large reactors with complete design under construction by 2030.' According to a Brookfield spokesperson, the U.S. government will provide the initial capital for the project. The initiative marks the most significant U.S. government investment in nuclear power since Trump\u2019s return to the White House in January 2025. Tech companies including Google and Microsoft have also launched major nuclear projects to meet AI\u2019s high energy demands. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated the effort 'will help unleash President Trump's grand vision to fully energize America and win the global AI race,' framing the AI race as a national security priority. The joint press release notes that each two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear project will sustain 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs across 43 states, with nationwide deployment expected to create over 100,000 construction jobs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 03:09 PM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/energies/article/2025/10/28/trump-administration-launches-80-billion-nuclear-partnership-to-power-ai-expansion_6746862_98.html)\n\n**The Costs of the Cloud | Ashley Dawson**\nThe environmental impact of artificial intelligence (AI) has drawn increasing scrutiny since the 2022 launch of ChatGPT, with public reports highlighting AI\u2019s massive energy consumption and high water usage for cooling data center equipment. In response, state-level initiatives to mandate reporting of AI\u2019s environmental footprint emerged, but have yielded limited results. The Biden administration issued an executive order in 2023 titled 'Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,' which emphasized promoting competition in the AI industry and addressing civil liberties and national security risks, but notably avoided addressing AI\u2019s significant energy demands. In early 2024, Senator Edward Markey introduced legislation requiring the federal government to assess AI\u2019s environmental footprint and establish a voluntary reporting system for companies; however, the bill died in Congress without a vote. In contrast, the European Union adopted a stronger version of the measure, which became effective in August 2024.

Pillar 1 calls for investment in AI-Enabled Science, particularly cloud-based automated labs, which could enhance reproducibility, accessibility, and scalability in biological research\u2014though funding remains the top barrier to adoption. RAND warns that such platforms may also introduce misuse risks at the biosecurity-cyberbiosecurity nexus, requiring standardized safeguards. Pillar 2 focuses on building world-class scientific datasets, advocating for minimum standards in bioinformatics and a national whole genome sequencing (WGS) program to create high-quality, interoperable datasets. Data standardization is critical for training reliable Generative AI (Gen AI) models and ensuring alignment with human values; however, U.S. bioinformatics data remain underutilized and fragmented, with existing data stacks needing curation before new data collection. The plan's Pillar 3 addresses national security risks from frontier AI models, recommending evaluations of CBRN threats\u2014including biological weapons\u2014through collaboration between CAISI and CBRN agencies. Frontier models like OpenAI\u2019s o3 (April 2025) and DeepSeek-R1 (January 2025) have demonstrated capabilities rivaling human experts, raising concerns about misuse, despite current limitations. The plan is weak on direct biosecurity investment, primarily recycling model evaluation measures and focusing on nucleic acid sequence (NAS) enforcement\u2014screening, verification, and data sharing\u2014though no legal mandate currently requires NAS providers to screen orders. Risks persist as synthetic gene costs fall, enabling malicious actors to obtain pathogenic sequences. The RAND authors emphasize that closing governance gaps through sustained investment, public-private partnerships, and balanced safeguards is urgent, as failure to align AI innovation with biosecurity imperatives could lead to technological loss and catastrophic vulnerabilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 11:18 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/rand-corporation/dissecting-americas-ai-action-plan-a-primer-for-biosecurity-researchers-b4840716043d)\n\n**Alarm and Concern in China: 'Terrorists Can Manufacture Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons Thanks to AI'**\nAccording to a report issued by China\u2019s National Cybersecurity Standardization Technical Committee and the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team, the current state of artificial intelligence poses a \"real risk\" of enabling extremist groups to acquire the technical knowledge needed to produce nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. The warning, released on 22 September 2025, stresses that the danger does not lie in AI creating weapons autonomously but in humans using AI as a shortcut to access detailed, previously restricted information. The report singles out \"retrieval\u2011augmented generation\" as the most concerning technique, allowing AI models to query real\u2011time databases and generate step\u2011by\u2011step instructions for missile design, bioweapon synthesis, or lethal chemical compounds. This could render existing non\u2011proliferation controls ineffective, as the Chinese authorities note that \"the logic of non\u2011proliferation rests on scarcity of materials and knowledge,\" and that the availability of such knowledge would \"intensify threats to global and regional peace and security.\" The document frames the warning within China\u2019s 2024 Global AI Governance Initiative, highlighting the dual\u2011use risks of AI while simultaneously investing heavily in state\u2011controlled AI development. It also lists other risks such as addiction to human\u2011like conversational systems, impacts on education and innovation, and the use of AI for political misinformation, sophisticated fraud, and new forms of cyberbullying. The overarching message is that \"AI must always remain under human control,\" yet the report acknowledges the difficulty of imposing limits in a global ecosystem of open\u2011source development and commercial incentives.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 10:07 AM\nSource:[Vandal](https://vandal.elespanol.com/random/alarma-y-preocupacion-en-china-los-terroristas-pueden-fabricar-armas-nucleares-biologicas-y-quimicas-gracias-a-la-ia/36951.html)\n\n**How to Regulate AI**\nThe article outlines the accelerating pace of artificial\u2011intelligence (AI) development and the emerging regulatory response in the United States. President Trump\u2019s July executive orders and AI action plan aim to speed AI innovation while restricting federal purchases of tools deemed ideologically biased and easing permits for new AI infrastructure. The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that in the 2025 session all 50 states considered AI\u2011related measures. Experts highlight several risks: algorithmic price collusion, AI\u2011driven scams such as \u2018Pig\u2011butcher\u00ading frauds\u2019, and autonomous cryptocurrency attacks that could bypass traditional banking safeguards. They call for safeguards including kill switches, human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop oversight, and mandatory monitoring of AI agents. Danielle Allen presents three governance paradigms\u2014accelerationist, effective altruism, and pluralism\u2014arguing the U.S. should pursue the pluralism model to preserve democratic values. Ryan McBain proposes guardrails for mental\u2011health chatbots, such as clinician\u2011anchored benchmarks, enhanced crisis routing, and privacy protections. David Yang stresses the need for global collaboration rather than zero\u2011sum competition. Paulo Carv\u00e3o critiques the Trump AI Action Plan for its lack of guardrails, while Bernardo Bizzo calls for clinical AI regulation that supports foundation models and continuous post\u2011market monitoring.

Lucas Hansen, cofounder of the AI\u2011education nonprofit CivAI, said \u2018Many people on the face of the planet already could create a bio weapon,\u2019 and noted that since 2022 the number of people who could potentially recreate a virus such as polio has risen from 30,000 to 200,000, with a projection of 1.5\u202fmillion by 2028. In a demonstration, Hansen prompted a jail\u2011broken Claude\u202f4.0 Sonnet model to produce 13 detailed steps for polio, including ordering a custom plasmid. The piece cites that AI models like Claude and ChatGPT now have improved metacognition, enabling them to fill gaps in scientific literature. Paromita Pain warned that accidental misuse could occur, saying \u2018It\u2019s essentially like letting loose teenagers in the lab.\u2019 The article also reports that both the Biden and Trump administrations have issued executive orders and action plans to regulate AI for biosecurity, and that California\u2019s SB\u202f1047 was vetoed by Gov.

The 2023 order had required AI firms, especially OpenAI, to share safety\u2011check results with the government. It also mandated the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop AI safety standards and required other agencies to continuously assess AI risks in sectors such as chemistry, biology, nuclear, cyber\u2011security and critical infrastructure. The order contained provisions to protect workers and consumers from AI harms, such as reporting on AI\u2019s impact on the labor market and developing counter\u2011measures against AI\u2011driven fraud and discrimination. Trump repeatedly said he would make AI development a top priority. At his inauguration, tech giants including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk\u2019s $100\u202fbillion offer for OpenAI, and Mark Zuckerberg were present. The article notes that Google\u2019s directive on non\u2011military AI safety was apparently withdrawn, and that the European Commission had also rejected its 2022 AI Liability Directive. Rod Friman, head of Cooley\u2019s global technology and venture\u2011capital practice, said the move should not be seen as a change in the EU\u2019s overall AI regulatory course, noting that new laws had already been adopted but their impact was still being assessed. Chinese startup DeepSeek has shown rapid growth in both updates and user base, and China claims to be taking leadership in AI development across several sectors. The article concludes that Trump\u2019s revocation of Biden\u2019s orders does not mean AI development support will disappear in the U.S.; instead, it focuses on export controls and rapid creation of AI data centers on federal land. The piece defines AI broadly as intelligence demonstrated by machines, especially computer systems, that can learn and make decisions to maximize their goals.\nOriginal language: az\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 04:34 PM\nSource:[sesqazeti.az](https://sesqazeti.az/news/world/1279054.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "The expert forecasts unanimously agree that, as of late 2025, the United States will not have in force the AI foundation model reporting requirements set by Executive Order 14110 or any regulation meeting or exceeding those standards, should Donald Trump be president. Every analyst notes that Trump revoked EO 14110 immediately upon taking office in January 2025, fulfilling his public commitment to repealing Biden-era AI reporting rules and replacing them with a deregulatory, innovation- and competitiveness-focused policy. Across the domains of US administrative law, AI policy, legislative affairs, political science, public policy, and science and technology studies, forecasters identify a consistent deregulatory signal in administration action, rhetoric, and industry-state interaction. They note that there is no evidence of a legislative or regulatory replacement; Congress has not passed any comparable statutory mandate, and remaining agency actions center on infrastructure and export control rather than broad, mandatory reporting. Some experts note extremely narrow scenarios\u2014such as a catastrophic AI misuse event or sudden bipartisan Congressional reversal\u2014that could prompt urgent reintroduction of reporting mandates, but all agree such events are highly unlikely within the final two months of 2025. While sectoral voluntary standards and some state initiatives are acknowledged, they are uniformly seen as inadequate to meet the resolution specs of ongoing, comprehensive dual-use foundation model reporting. Base rate reasoning and recent policy history further lower the plausibility of rapid regulatory re-establishment. Final probabilities from all experts fall between 2 and 7 percent, with most forecasting a very low (3\u20135%) chance of the reporting requirements remaining in place as defined. The consensus: binding federal AI foundation model reporting is highly unlikely to persist or to be quickly reinstated under Trump by end-2025 absent a dramatic external shock.",
