Additionally, even optimistic outlier polls do not get close to a net-positive reading, and the aggregate inertia will be more pronounced as special elections, scandals, and economic frustrations remain salient.

Even a successful reframing or positive shock event would likely not sustain a net-positive for long, given the deep partisan segmentation revealed by Framing Theory and polarization research. Given all these factors, the status quo is very likely to hold, making a net-positive outcome extremely improbable.",

From my vantage point in polling methodology, their argument astutely acknowledges the influence that prevailing media agenda\u2014amplified or filtered through persistent polling questions\u2014has on public sentiment, which then manifests in aggregates like FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model. Not only is the media\u2019s focus overwhelmingly on negative storylines relevant to Trump, but this is reflected and reinforced in the poll results that make up the 538 average.\n\nFrom a sampling methodology lens, such a dominant media frame rarely allows for a rapid, sustained reversal in net favorability, as even the rare outlier poll gets quickly diluted by the larger ecosystem. The Agenda Setting forecaster is right to highlight that in the absence of a major agenda-changing event, shifts are slow and require much more than ordinary news cycles to move polling aggregates materially. Their acknowledgment of the lone positive I&I TIPP poll as an outlier also reflects methodological sophistication\u2014a perspective I share, since such polls are given less weight in 538\u2019s aggregate. Thus, this argument is well-founded both in communication theory and in the practical effects seen in polling aggregates.

Research shows that even if outlier pollsters use different wording or sampling frames, the overwhelming agenda focus ensures any outlier positivity is quickly subsumed within the aggregate, especially in 538's method. Furthermore, the point about the media's focus on negative issues\u2014scandals, economic malaise, and party division\u2014matches observed polling house effects: when negative frames dominate, favorable polling responses are suppressed even with neutral (or positive) question wording, and the opposite outliers rarely have enough impact to tip a robust aggregate. The defense is especially warranted given the lack of any prospective agenda-setting event on the horizon that could fundamentally shift both media tone and aggregate poll results. Overall, their position integrates communication research and public opinion dynamics in a way that polling methodologists would find convincing."

A strictly voter-behavior lens sometimes overlooks that\u2014even in extremely polarized environments\u2014a single external event (e.g., a foreign policy crisis or major bipartisan initiative), if immediately followed by a cluster of friendly polls, can temporarily push an aggregate across the zero mark due to polling lag, weighting, and reporting artifacts, even if only for a day. 538\u2019s methodology usually cushions against this but is not totally immune. Thus, the probability for a fleeting Yes resolution, while still very low, might be understated by relying exclusively on the durability of voter attitudes and missing the slim but meaningful risk from polling cadence and technical quirks in aggregation around holidays or news surges."

However, the argument may slightly overstate the aggregate\u2019s insensitivity to short-term, large-magnitude shifts. Subtle variations in question wording, especially in fast-moving crisis contexts, can produce outsized responses among less-engaged respondents or Independents, which\u2014if clustered in several polls over a holiday trough or news spike\u2014could briefly nudge the aggregate across zero. Moreover, methodological differences (e.g., frequency of poll updates, inclusion of nontraditional modes, or rapid field dates after a major event) could create moments where sampling and question effects reinforce one another unusually. While rare, such conditions mean the chance of a fleeting positive is not strictly limited by previous trends. Therefore, the probability should remain extremely low, but not be treated as absolutely negligible, when acknowledging the complex interaction of question design and aggregate construction."

Their points on the enduring structure of public sentiment\u2014reinforced by repeated news cycles and the self-perpetuating nature of elite and mass polarization\u2014are exactly what theory and data suggest.

They are correct to highlight the importance of sampling frames and the weighting within 538, which systematically dampens the influence of short-lived or outlier positive results. Additionally, the mention of generational trends and the collapse of honeymoon effects reflects a strong understanding of how societal polarization and demographic sorting reinforce the status quo. The low probability forecast is justified given all recent trends and historical precedent.

Their point that even a counter-frame or unexpected positive event would struggle to sustainably shift the net favorability score is well-founded: established frames filter new information and reinforce selective perception, making durable reversals extremely difficult. This aligns with Media Effects Theory's understanding of agenda-setting power and reinforcement spirals.

The parallel drawn between reinforcement spirals and aggregate polling inertia is well-supported by communication research: once a frame\u2014especially a negative or scandal-driven one\u2014dominates, it becomes harder for events or even counter-frames to break through, particularly in a fragmented, polarized information ecosystem.

Framing Theory predicts that narrative inflection rarely occurs quickly or spontaneously; it requires sustained, widely-covered, and positively framed elite cues that bridge polarization\u2014a scenario not just unlikely but unsupported in recent coverage. Their argument that only a paradigm-shifting exogenous event could disrupt the status quo fits well: frames become 'sticky' and self-reinforcing, and positive cues are filtered through hostile lenses by both media and partisan audiences. The mention of the need for a single positive daily average is a methodological caveat, but also one that, when considered from a framing/communication standpoint, remains vanishingly improbable.

Trump\u2019s ratings on immigration (\u20135.3), the economy (\u201315.6) and trade (\u201317.3) have been stable, but his net approval on inflation (\u201330.0) has dropped six points since the end of August.

In Victoria, a Redbridge poll gave Labor a 52\u201148\u202f% lead, while a DemosAU poll gave the Coalition a 51\u201149\u202f% lead.  In New\u202fSouth\u202fWales, the Resolve poll gave Labor a 38\u202f% primary vote versus 28\u202f% for the Coalition.  A national Morgan poll gave Labor a 55.5\u201144.5\u202f% lead, and Newspoll aggregate data from July to September showed Labor ahead 57\u201143\u202f% nationally.

For a brief period (late February\u2011early March), 50\u202f% of Americans approved of Trump\u2019s mass\u2011deportation policies. Trump\u2019s overall approval on the economy is 35\u202f%, slightly below Biden\u2019s 34\u202f% (December\u202f2024). The poll also shows Trump and Republicans are more trusted than Democrats on most key issues, with 54\u202f% of respondents saying the economy is on the wrong track, up from 52\u202f% in July.

Wildeford began forecasting in 2020, motivated by the COVID\u201119 pandemic, and initially made classic beginner mistakes such as extrapolating linear trends and underestimating the spread of the virus. He later adopted a \u2018nothing ever happens\u2019 approach, which he says is usually correct but fails when events actually occur. Wildeford credits humility and selective positioning for improving accuracy, noting that he now only takes positions when he believes the market lacks information that he can add.\n\nHe emphasizes the value of expert teams, citing his 2022 midterm collaboration with two demography and candidate\u2011position specialists. Their model predicted a stronger Democratic performance than conventional wisdom, though it fell short of winning the House. Wildeford\u2019s team\u2011building strategy involves maintaining a Rolodex of experts with proven track records, often sourced from Twitter or personal contacts, and using their aggregated insights to inform forecasts.\n\nAn example of his methodology is the US\u2011Iran scenario, where he and his network of Middle\u2011East experts correctly anticipated that a U.S. strike on Iran would likely succeed, echoing the 2020 Soleimani strike. He also discusses his \u2018nothing ever happens\u2019 stance, noting that prediction markets exhibit a systematic pro\u2011Yes bias: community averages for \u2018Yes\u2019 responses are consistently higher than actual outcomes.\n\nWildeford\u2019s current major \u2018No\u2019 positions include: no new country will adopt Bitcoin this year; Time\u2019s Person of the Year will not be AI, Pope Leo XIV, or Donald Trump; and he predicts that the Romanian presidential election will not follow typical polling patterns, a claim that proved incorrect.\n\nHe uses AI as a sanity\u2011checking tool but remains skeptical of AI\u2019s competitive forecasting capabilities, citing open\u2011source requirements for IMO Grand Challenge prizes. Wildeford concludes by advocating a steady, low\u2011risk approach, buying positions at 88\u201390\u202fcents when they should be 95\u202fcents, and stresses that most provocative predictions fail.\n\nKey metrics and quotes: Wildeford is ranked 3 of 17,645 on Metaculus; Polymarket has 57,034 readers; he started forecasting in 2020; his 2022 midterm team predicted Democrats would perform better than the 538 model; he says, 'I have a 'nothing ever happens' approach to forecasting, which is right most of the time but painfully wrong when things actually do happen.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 04:20 AM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/sponsored-post/top-political-forecaster-nothing-ever-happens)\n\n**Lee\u202fJae\u2011myung\u2019s Approval Rating Falls to 52.0\u202f% Amid Tariff Negotiation Challenges**\nAccording to a Realmeter poll conducted from 22\u201326 September 2025 with 2,527 voters aged 18 and older, President Lee\u202fJae\u2011myung\u2019s approval of his performance fell to 52.0\u202f%\u2014a 1.0\u2011point drop from the previous week. 44.1\u202f% of respondents judged his performance negatively, up 0.5\u202fpoints.

Silver\u2019s methodology averages all polls, weighting them by quality, recency, sample size and partisan lean, and prefers the all\u2011adult version when multiple versions exist, as he explains: 'Our default average reflects a combination of all polls, whether conducted among adults, registered voters or likely voters\u2026'  The article also reports that the White House posted on X that 57.11\u202fpercent of Americans approve of Trump, a figure that contrasts sharply with the polling data.

The article notes that millennials now constitute the largest voting bloc, surpassing baby boomers, and that their turnout patterns are shifting, making their support crucial for the 2026 midterm elections.  Scholars quoted in the piece highlight that the Great Recession and the pandemic are the two most significant events shaping millennial attitudes, and that rising prices, vaccine\u2011access policies, and housing affordability are key concerns.  Heath Brown of City University of New York said, 'The two most significant events for many millennials are the Great Recession and the Pandemic.'  Mark Shanahan of the University of Surrey added, 'A lot of younger voters, including many independents and others, especially young men who don't generally exercise their democratic prerogative, leant Trump their vote in 2024 on the promise of an upturn in the economy and that they'd feel better off personally. Few, if any, are feeling either.'

A YouGov poll released Tuesday records a net approval of \u201318, the lowest since January, with declines across every age group and most racial groups. Quinnipiac University\u2019s Wednesday poll finds Trump with 38% approval and 54% disapproval on seven key issues. Nate Silver\u2019s Silver Bulletin shows 43.9% approval and 53.3% disapproval, a net of \u20139, the lowest since July 24. Despite these figures, the White House and Trump continue to highlight positive numbers: Trump said at the UN General Assembly, 'I was very proud to see this morning I have the highest poll numbers I've ever had. Part of it is because of what we've done on the border. I guess the other part is what we've done on the economy.' The White House X account posted, '57.11% of Americans APPROVE of President Trump! MAGA!' and Trump shared a similar graphic on Truth Social. Rasmussen Reports, cited by the White House, reports 49% approval and 50% disapproval among likely voters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 07:35 PM\nSource:[NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/09/trump-gets-sucker-punched-in-new-polling-following-a-rough-week.html)\n\n**This 'horrendous number' may be the key predictor of major GOP defeat in midterms: analyst**\nPolitical analyst Matthew Dowd argues that the GOP faces a mid\u2011term defeat, citing Trump\u2019s declining approval and the Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm advantage. Dowd notes Trump\u2019s net disapproval rating fell from \u20139 in 2018 to \u201314 today, and his approval among independent voters dropped from a net \u201320 in 2018 to a net \u201330 now, which he calls a \u2018horrendous number\u2019. He also points to Democrats outperforming Republicans in special elections, with an average over\u2011performance of 15\u202f% since the November\u202f2024 general election (over 40 special elections), compared to 10\u202f% in 2017 and no over\u2011performance in 2022. Dowd highlights that the economy is the top issue, with Trump receiving a net disapproval of \u201316 overall and \u201329 among independents. He concludes that the GOP\u2019s only advantage is gerrymandering, which he says is not a guarantee given these numbers.  Dowd stated, \u2018Here are a half dozen reasons why I believe that Republicans are in a worse position in the political environment than they were in the 2018 elections when Democratic candidates did exceedingly well when the votes were all counted.\u2019\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 06:22 PM\nSource:[Alternet.org](https://www.alternet.org/republicans-trouble-mid-terms/)\n\n**Donald Trump approval ratings: See what latest polls reveal amid fall controversies**\nThe article reports the latest U.S. presidential approval ratings for Donald Trump as of September\u202f2025, drawing on a range of national polls.

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of Donald Trump having a positive net favorability on December 20, 2025, according to FiveThirtyEight, is extremely low. They cite several reinforcing factors: (1) Trump's persistent double-digit net negative favorability throughout both presidencies, with only a fleeting post-election 'honeymoon' that fell short of net positive; (2) deep partisan polarization, which severely limits upward swings in net ratings; (3) negative recent trends in polling, with no reputable poll showing Trump at net positive, and some noting recent record-lows or further slippage, including among Republicans; (4) 538's robust smoothing and aggregation methods, which dampen short-term or outlier-driven surges; (5) the absence of any plausible event in the near horizon likely to trigger a broad, sustained, cross-partisan rally (e.g., major foreign policy success or economic boom); (6) the negative framing and agenda-setting predominant in both mainstream and conservative media, which keeps negative issues salient. Experts from polling methodology, political science, sociology, and communication all independently rate the base rate of presidents overcoming entrenched net negatives this late in a term as near zero, with wide agreement that only an unprecedented or black-swan event would flip the aggregate positive\u2014and even that would be likely short-lived and suppressed by 538's methodology. The small nonzero probabilities (ranging from 2% to 4%) given across the forecasts reflect only the theoretical chance of extraordinary events or statistical flukes. The consensus is that, barring an unpredictable historic shock, Trump's 538 net favorability will remain negative at the resolution date.",
