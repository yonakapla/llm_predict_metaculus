We are seeing the start of rotation and leadership change (Mag Ten, AI expansion), which, if orderly, may limit maximum individual losses in the original Seven. Also, technical support is holding so far\u2014no breakdowns or volume climaxes yet on weekly/monthly charts. Some names (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, META) remain structurally strong, and unless we see a regime-shifting event, the probability of a simultaneous 50%+ drop in at least four is lower than headlines suggest.

Major sector and ETF inflows, ongoing fundamental profit growth, and the tendency for leadership transitions to be protracted further moderate risk.

Sector rotation and internal divergence (as Boom/Bust Cycles and Sector Rotation forecasters stress) can diffuse and stagger any correction, while strong cash flows and buybacks remain a formidable defense. However, the razor-thin timeline, absent a black swan, keeps large drawdowns more of a tail risk than a base case.

The report states that U.S. equities are trading at a 10% premium above fundamental valuations. This concern is echoed by a Bank of America (BofA) survey of 166 fund managers with $400 billion in assets, which found that 54% now believe tech stocks are overvalued\u2014up sharply from nearly 50% the previous month. The S&P 500\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at the 96th percentile since 1990, indicating that only 4% of historical periods have seen higher valuations. The IMF notes that market gains are outpacing earnings expectations, reflecting excessive investor optimism. A key risk is the extreme concentration of the U.S. market: the 'Magnificent Seven' (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla) now represent 33% of the S&P 500, a record high and surpassing the concentration seen during the dot-com bubble of 2000. The IMF warns that if large-cap AI-related stocks fail to deliver expected returns, investor confidence could collapse, triggering sharp declines. Rafael Valera, CEO of Buy & Hold, compares the current AI-driven rally to the 2000 dot-com bubble, citing Oracle\u2019s 500-billion-dollar cloud contracts as a sign of speculative excess. Despite these concerns, some analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs, argue it is too early to conclude a bubble. The IMF also highlights a paradox: despite rising geopolitical and economic uncertainty\u2014including tariffs at 100-year highs\u2014market volatility has declined, driven by expectations that negative impacts will be temporary. However, the report cautions that falling corporate margins, except for the Magnificent Seven, could eventually pressure stock valuations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 01:40 PM\nSource:[Cinco D\u00edas](https://cincodias.elpais.com/fondos-y-planes/2025-10-14/el-fmi-y-los-gestores-de-fondos-avisan-del-riesgo-de-burbuja-ante-el-furor-de-la-inteligencia-artificial.html)\n\n**The Promise of a Bubble: Warnings Mount Over Overvalued AI Stocks**\nThe Bank of England (BoE) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have issued warnings about a potential artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, stating that technology stocks\u2014particularly those focused on AI\u2014are significantly overvalued, increasing the risk of a major market correction that could impact global economies and stall worldwide economic growth. Recent stock surges have been driven by optimism over AI's potential to boost productivity: NVIDIA reached a $3 billion valuation, and OpenAI achieved a $500 billion valuation, becoming the world\u2019s most valuable startup. However, OpenAI has not yet turned a profit, reporting approximately $5 billion in losses last year. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study found that 95% of organizations are not achieving returns on their generative AI investments. The market's enthusiasm relies heavily on potential rather than proven value, mirroring the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where companies were valued based on growth promises without sustainable revenue. Similarly, the 'Magnificent Seven'\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia\u2014now represent about 40% of the S&P 500, amplifying systemic risk if market sentiment shifts. Despite their revolutionary promise, AI technologies still face significant limitations, including generating false or inconsistent information\u2014evidenced by a Deloitte report containing fabricated sources and citations. While AI\u2019s long-term impact on the economy and society is expected to be profound, similar to the internet and mobile communication, the potential consequences of a bursting AI bubble remain uncertain.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 11:04 PM\nSource:[Observador](https://observador.pt/opiniao/a-promessa-de-uma-bolha/)\n\n**Central banks stoked the dotcom bubble. They're doing it again for AI**\nThe article draws a parallel between the current surge in artificial intelligence (AI)-related stock valuations and the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. It highlights that the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla\u2014now account for $21 trillion in market capitalization, representing 36% of the S&P 500. This AI-driven rally is fueled by major investments, such as Nvidia\u2019s $100 billion stake in OpenAI and OpenAI\u2019s 10% acquisition of AMD. Despite global economic headwinds like tariffs and corporate earnings volatility, U.S. economic growth remains resilient, supported by AI spending and rising stock prices. The Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has issued warnings about a potential sharp global market correction, echoing concerns raised by former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan in 1996 with his 'irrational exuberance' speech. The FPC\u2019s caution mirrors the pre-bubble warnings of the dotcom era, when the Nasdaq Composite index took 15 years to recover from its 2000 peak. The article questions whether today\u2019s market optimism is a timely warning or a repeat of past overconfidence, with the risk that narrative-driven investing may once again override fundamental valuation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The Magnificent Seven, which have benefited from artificial intelligence (AI) demand and heavy tech investments, have outperformed the S&P 500 since the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) launched in April 2023, rising over 165% compared to the S&P 500's 64% gain. However, the article highlights risks: these stocks are vulnerable to market downturns, as seen in 2022 when each fell more than 26%, with Meta and Tesla losing around 65% of their value. In contrast, the S&P 500 declined only 19% that year. The article notes concerns about an AI-driven bubble and potential slowdown in spending during a recession, suggesting that while the Magnificent Seven offer high growth potential, the S&P 500 provides broader diversification and lower volatility.

While share valuations are high\u2014with the US forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio at 23.6 times, close to the 1999\u20132000 tech boom peak\u2014and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, Tesla) have accounted for over 50% of S&P 500 gains since 2023 despite representing only one-third of market cap, the underlying fundamentals are stronger than during the late 1990s tech boom. Unlike dot-com stocks, which were unprofitable, the Magnificent Seven are generating around 30% year-on-year profit growth, and broader US corporate profits rose 11.5% year-on-year in the September quarter. AI investment is still in early stages, with mixed results, but productivity gains from AI tools are already evident. Despite speculative activity in gold and bitcoin, their rise is partly driven by concerns over public debt sustainability and geopolitical risks, not pure speculation. US investor sentiment is optimistic but not euphoric, and a surge in Google searches for 'AI bubble' since June may indicate contrarian optimism. Market indicators like PMIs remain consistent with economic growth, and no recession is currently evident. The key takeaway for investors is that while corrections are normal and high valuations signal risk, timing market moves is extremely difficult\u2014history shows that warnings of 'irrational exuberance' (like in 1995) can persist for years. Therefore, investors should adopt a long-term strategy aligned with their risk tolerance, financial situation, and age, and stick to it to avoid missing out on long-term gains.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 03:28 AM\nSource:[finnewsnetwork.com.au](https://www.finnewsnetwork.com.au/archives/finance_news_network2902266.html)\n\n**Stock market 'concentration risk' now higher than dot-com bubble period, IMF warns**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that concentration risk in the U.S. stock market is now higher than during the dot-com bubble period, citing the dominance of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia\u2014which accounted for 33% of the S&P 500 index as of October 2025. This concentration is particularly concerning because the information technology sector made up 35% of the index, mirroring levels seen in the 1990s, but now driven by just seven companies. The IMF emphasized that 'concentration risk was now substantially higher than during the dot-com bubble.' The report attributes this heightened risk to stretched valuations, especially in AI-related stocks, which have driven around 80% of U.S. equity gains in 2025. Despite negative economic data and rising concerns over U.S. tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and sovereign debt, financial markets have remained calm, with conditions easing to 'accommodative levels.' The IMF cautioned that this 'apparent calm masks a degree of complacency,' warning that if mega-cap stocks fail to deliver expected returns, investor sentiment could deteriorate rapidly, triggering a 'sudden, sharp correction.' Additionally, the report highlighted growing stress in sovereign bond markets due to widening fiscal deficits, with core bond markets increasingly reliant on price-sensitive investors\u2014a 'tail risk' that could have broad financial disruptions. The U.S. dollar has depreciated by about 10% year-to-date against major currencies, with analysts attributing this to concerns over U.S. fiscal policy and policy uncertainty driving capital outflows from dollar-denominated assets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[The Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/10/14/stock-market-concentration-risk-now-higher-than-dot-com-bubble-period-imf-warns/)\n\n**IMF and Fund Managers Warn of AI-Driven Stock Bubble Amid Market Overheating**\nThe Financial Stability Report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on October 14, 2025, warns of a potential stock market bubble driven by the global frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI).

Analyst opinions on these companies vary significantly. C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald raised Nvidia\u2019s price target to $300 per share, projecting 64% upside and a potential $7.3 trillion valuation, citing Nvidia\u2019s dominant position in the AI accelerator market, its strategic partnership with OpenAI, its annual GPU release cycle (Vera Rubin and Vera Rubin Ultra expected in 2026 and 2027), and the entrenched CUDA software ecosystem. Despite this optimism, historical patterns suggest early-stage technology booms often end in bubble bursts, and Nvidia faces risks from internal AI chip development by its major customers (e.g., Meta, Amazon), which could reduce demand for its hardware. In contrast, Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research maintains a bearish stance on Tesla, projecting a price target of $19.05 per share based on a 15x earnings multiple and a 9% discount rate. Johnson highlights Tesla\u2019s structural disadvantages \u2014 reliance on low-margin hardware sales versus high-margin software, declining sales and earnings, and a valuation of 242x forecast 2025 EPS \u2014 as well as Elon Musk\u2019s history of overpromising (e.g., Level 5 autonomy, robotaxi launch, Optimus robot) without delivery, which Johnson argues is overvalued and unsustainable.

CEO Ian Simm noted that while the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants\u2014Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, and Tesla\u2014account for nearly 45% of the Nasdaq 100 Index and have seen explosive gains driven by fear of missing out, many asset owners are now worried about market narrowness and are seeking diversification into non-Mag 7 portfolios. Impax has stayed largely on the sidelines of Big Tech\u2019s rally, allowing it to tilt its portfolio toward defensive growth, small and mid-cap companies, and sectors like industrials and materials, while avoiding digital technology. This strategy has reduced its exposure to a potential sell-off. Despite recent challenges\u2014including the loss of a US$6 billion mandate to Schroders, outflows from BNP Paribas sub-managed funds, and redemptions in North America\u2014Impax has seen 'some quite significant new mandates kicking off,' particularly in the institutional space, with a strong pipeline of new business. The Impax Global Environmental Markets Fund, with about US$2 billion in assets, is up roughly 13% year-to-date. Holdings include Microsoft and Nvidia, as well as traditional green stocks like Schneider Electric, Xylem, and Waste Management. The firm also offers private equity investments in clean energy, which has rebounded due to rising demand from AI-driven data centers. The S&P Global Clean Energy Transition Index is up about 40% in 2025, compared to 11% for the S&P 500, while the S&P Global Oil Index is up less than 5%. Simm attributes this trend to a growing power deficit in the Western world, especially in the US, driven by data center expansion and rising energy prices, fueling interest in energy efficiency and clean power generation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 11:44 PM\nSource:[The Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/ai-bubble-fears-spread-us35-billion-fund-manager-positions-inflows)\n\n**Experts Warn of an AI Bubble Resembling the Dotcom Crash**\nExperts are warning of a potential AI bubble mirroring the dotcom crash of the early 2000s, as AI company valuations continue to surge despite minimal profitability. Institutions including the Bank of England, the IMF, and JP Morgan have raised alarms, noting a heightened risk of a sudden market correction. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI\u2019s valuation has grown from $30 billion to nearly $500 billion, while Anthropic\u2019s valuation tripled in just six months\u2014from $60 billion to $170 billion. According to Goldman Sachs, AI-related firms have accounted for approximately 80% of the S&P 500\u2019s gains in 2025. Nvidia, a key supplier of AI chips, saw its market capitalization increase by over 220% in one year, reaching over $4 trillion\u2014making it the most valuable company in the world, surpassing Amazon and Alphabet combined. The 'Magnificent Seven' (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla) now represent over one-third of the S&P 500, compared to 15% at the peak of the dotcom bubble in 2000. Apollo Global Management\u2019s chief economist Torsten Slok suggests the AI boom may exceed the dotcom bubble in scale, citing that the ten largest S&P 500 companies are currently more overvalued relative to fundamentals than they were during the dotcom era. Similarities include AI firms engaging in circular transactions, buying each other\u2019s products, and using supplier financing to sustain growth. James Anderson of Baillie Gifford stated, 'Just a few months ago, I was surprised there were no signs of a bubble. Now they are too visible,' adding that the scale and pace of OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s valuations are deeply concerning.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 09:32 PM\nSource:[Cyfrowa](https://cyfrowa.rp.pl/globalne-interesy/art43168451-sztuczna-inteligencja-jak-dotcomy-eksperci-ostrzegaja-przed-banka-ai)\n\n**Bubble trouble \u2013 is AI enthusiasm driving a bubble in shares?**\nDr. Shane Oliver, Chief Economist and Head of Investment Strategy at AMP, analyzes concerns over a potential stock market bubble driven by excessive enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).

The stock markets are pricing in future AI-driven growth, with US tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla\u2014collectively known as the 'Magnificent 7'\u2014seeing massive gains. Nvidia alone rose over 1,400% in three years, and the S&P 500 is currently valued at a price-earnings ratio (P/E) of 22, well above its long-term average of 16. Nvidia's P/E reached 48, and the 'Magnificent 7' group's P/E stands at 37, reflecting high expectations. While some analysts argue this overvaluation is justified by exceptional growth prospects, experts warn that sustained high valuations are unsustainable. Historically, the dot-com bubble burst after less than five years, but the AI boom has now lasted nearly seven years. Christian W. R\u00f6hl of Scalable Capital notes that, like the dot-com era, today's AI investments are driven by excitement for an uncertain future. The ultimate test remains actual profitability, not projected growth. A correction is inevitable, though timing is unpredictable. European markets (EuroStoxx 50) are only moderately overvalued (P/E of 15 vs. long-term average of 13), suggesting a milder correction, while US markets face greater risk due to deep interdependencies among tech giants and external factors like geopolitics and interest rates.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[tagesschau.de](https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/finanzen/ki-blase-100.html)\n\n**These 2 Magnificent Seven Stocks are Screaming Buys Right Now**\nThe article highlights two stocks from the 'Magnificent Seven' \u2014 Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) \u2014 as particularly compelling investment opportunities due to their strong fundamentals, leadership in artificial intelligence (AI), and attractive valuations. Alphabet, known for Google Search and Google Cloud, is trading at 21x forward earnings, making it the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven. Its dominance in search (around 90% market share) and growing AI-driven advertising and cloud revenues \u2014 including $13 billion in recent cloud revenue \u2014 support its valuation. A favorable U.S. antitrust ruling also removed the risk of a Google breakup. Meta Platforms, with 3.4 billion daily users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, is advancing as an AI leader through its own large language model (LLM), open-source initiatives, AI assistants, and AI hardware like AI glasses. It reported $47 billion in revenue and $18 billion in net income in the latest quarter, with $47 billion in cash and $1.33 billion in dividends paid. Meta trades at 25x forward earnings, making it the second-cheapest of the Magnificent Seven. Both companies are positioned to benefit from AI growth and are described as 'screaming buys' due to their strong performance and low valuations relative to peers. The article notes that all seven Magnificent Seven stocks \u2014 Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla \u2014 have driven S&P 500 double-digit gains over the past two years, but Alphabet and Meta stand out for their current value and growth potential.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 11:35 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/these-2-magnificent-seven-stocks-are-screaming-buy/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=dd0cd8aa-0ea8-4f65-a572-7ca6bbc008e9)\n\n**Magnificent Seven surpass EU GDP: Is this a tech bubble warning?**\nAs of 2 October 2025, the combined market capitalisation of the United States' Magnificent Seven tech giants\u2014Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla\u2014reached $20.8 trillion (\u20ac17.7tn), surpassing the European Union\u2019s total economic output of $19.4tn (\u20ac16.5tn). Nvidia alone is valued at approximately $4.3tn (\u20ac3.9tn), equivalent to Germany\u2019s GDP. This milestone has sparked debate over whether the current tech rally signals a transformative shift in global capitalism or the early warning signs of a new tech bubble. A tech bubble is traditionally defined by a disconnect between market prices and business fundamentals, driven by speculative fervour, social contagion, and irrational optimism\u2014characteristics described by economists Robert Shiller and Hyman Minsky. While investor enthusiasm for AI has surged since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, the Nasdaq 100 has risen 140% in under three years, far below the 500% gain in the three years leading to the March 2000 dot-com peak. Valuation metrics, such as the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, show that only Tesla (P/E of 220) is significantly overvalued; excluding Tesla, the Magnificent Seven trade at lower valuations than the broader Nasdaq 100, which trades above 40x forward earnings. Analyst Jordi Visser of 22V Research argues the rally reflects a structural arms race in AI, not speculative mania, driven by national and corporate investments in AI as a strategic imperative. Nevertheless, risks remain, including rapid capital inflows into AI-themed ETFs, speculative surges in small-cap AI stocks, and the historical precedent of dominant firms like AOL, BlackBerry, and Yahoo! being overtaken by innovation. While the current cycle lacks the euphoric excesses of the dot-com era, the boundary between structural transformation and speculative excess remains thin.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[Euronews English](http://www.euronews.com/business/2025/10/04/magnificent-seven-surpass-eu-gdp-is-this-a-tech-bubble-warning)\n\n**Magnificence beyond the Magnificent 7? Here's the next generation of AI winners powering the stock market.**\nThe S&P 500's rally in 2025 is increasingly driven by a new generation of AI-focused large-cap companies, shifting momentum away from the traditional 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has become the fourth-largest contributor to the S&P 500's market cap gains in 2025, surpassing Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL). Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) have also entered the top 10 for largest market-cap gains. While the Magnificent Seven still account for 36.4% of the S&P 500\u2019s total market capitalization, their collective market-cap growth in the first three quarters of 2025 was $3.1 trillion\u2014down from previous years\u2019 $5 trillion+ annual gains. Within the group, Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL), and Meta remain strong performers with year-to-date gains of 40.8%, 28.6%, 22.5%, and 24%, respectively, while Apple (up 2.7%), Amazon (up 1.3%), and Tesla (up 10%) have underperformed. Apple\u2019s slow AI rollout and Amazon\u2019s lagging cloud growth (AWS) have raised investor concerns. Oracle\u2019s stock rose 24.3% in September after announcing a $300 billion cloud-computing deal with OpenAI and projecting its cloud revenue to exceed $500 billion. Broadcom\u2019s shares surged 10.9% after its CEO committed to staying until at least 2030 and the company beat fourth-quarter expectations. Dan Hanson, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, stated that while the Magnificent Seven remain central to AI leadership, the market is evolving toward a 'Magnificent Ten' dynamic, with continued dominance expected from large-scale AI leaders. Despite speculation about broader market participation in the AI rally, Hanson believes the momentum will remain concentrated among top-tier firms. On October 3, 2025, U.S. stocks closed at record highs: the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, the S&P 500 gained less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%, according to FactSet.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 11:54 AM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20251003146/magnificence-beyond-the-magnificent-7-heres-the-next-generation-of-ai-winners-powering-the-stock-market)\n\n**Wall Street Seeks Successors to the 'Magnificent Seven' as Tech Dominance Shifts**\nThe dominance of the 'Magnificent Seven'\u2014the group of leading U.S. tech giants including the GAFAMs, Nvidia, and Tesla\u2014is reportedly waning, according to analysts. These companies, which drove U.S. market performance for two years, are now showing divergent trajectories: Tesla has fallen behind Broadcom in market capitalization, Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 with a 12% gain, and Amazon has lost 8% from its February peak. In contrast, Nvidia, Google, Meta, and Microsoft remain dominant, driven by stronger exposure to artificial intelligence (AI). The term 'Magnificent Seven' was coined by Bank of America in May 2023 when AI was still emerging, explaining the current divergence. As a result, new groupings have emerged to reflect market shifts, including the 'Fab Four' (Nvidia, Google, Meta, Microsoft), 'Big Six', 'Great Eight', 'Golden Dozen', and the CBOE's '10 Magnificent' index, which includes Broadcom, AMD, and Palantir. The collective weight of the original seven in the S&P 500 reached a record 34%, rising to 37% with Broadcom included. Analysts note that while the group is heterogeneous across sectors\u2014Amazon in discretionary consumption, Google in information technology, Nvidia in semiconductors\u2014their influence on market indices remains profound. JPMorgan strategists advocate for a new sector classification focused on AI, citing strong fundamentals, high investment capacity, and superior capital returns among a small number of S&P 500 stocks. David Rainville of Sycomore AM observes that the 'Magnificent Seven' has become synonymous with large-cap U.S. stocks and concentrated investment flows.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 10:16 AM\nSource:[LesEchos.fr](https://www.lesechos.fr/finance-marches/marches-financiers/fab-four-big-six-ou-great-eight-wall-street-cherche-les-remplacants-des-sept-magnifiques-2189723)\n\n**The Decline of the Magnificent Seven: The Rise of New AI Powerhouses**\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' \u2014 a group of dominant U.S. tech stocks including Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, and Tesla \u2014 are losing their market supremacy amid the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2021, these companies have driven over 70% of the S&P 500's gains since early 2023. However, new AI-focused firms such as Broadcom, Oracle, and Palantir Technologies are now outperforming them, with Oracle's stock rising over 75% in 2025 and Palantir surging 135% in the same period. Analysts like Chris Smith of Antero Peak Group argue that past tech winners don\u2019t guarantee future dominance, emphasizing that future leaders will emerge from companies leveraging AI across large, unconstrained markets. While the Magnificent Seven still represent about 35% of the S&P 500 and are projected to grow earnings over 15% by 2026, their internal performance varies: Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft have seen 21\u201333% gains, while Apple, Amazon, and Tesla show weaker momentum. New groupings such as the 'Magnificent Eight' (adding Broadcom), 'The Six Giants' (excluding Tesla), and the 'Magnificent Ten' (including Oracle, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices) are being proposed. Cboe Global Markets launched the 'CBOE Magnificent 10' index, combining the original seven with Broadcom, Palantir, and AMD, based on liquidity, market cap, trading volume, and AI leadership. Despite strong performance, Oracle and Palantir were not included in the original Magnificent Seven. Experts stress the need to expand beyond the old elite, noting that companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Arista Networks, Micron Technology, and storage firms such as Western Digital and Seagate are also key beneficiaries. Private AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX remain inaccessible to most investors. As AI adoption deepens, the beneficiaries are shifting from pure AI developers to specialized service providers and companies using AI to boost efficiency. According to Jorian Timer of Fidelity Investments, the era of the Magnificent Seven may end not with a smooth transition but with a potential market disruption if top firms lose their appeal. The current valuation levels are not yet alarming, but the risk of a sudden shift in market leadership is real.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 10:10 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https://www.aleqt.com/2025/10/02/article_2767380.html)\n\n**Magnificent 7 Is Passe. This Group of AI Stocks Can Replace It**\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' \u2014 Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., and Tesla Inc. \u2014 have dominated the U.S. stock market since the rise of AI in 2021, driving over half of the S&P 500's 70%+ gain since early 2023. However, as the AI revolution expands beyond the original seven, investors are shifting focus to a broader group of AI-focused companies. According to Chris Smith, portfolio manager at Artisan Partners, the next wave of AI leaders will emerge from firms addressing large, unconstrained markets, potentially surpassing the current Mag Seven in size and impact. While the original group still accounts for nearly 35% of the S&P 500, performance has diverged: Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are up 21%\u201333% in 2025, while Apple, Amazon, and Tesla are lagging. Analysts are proposing new groupings to better capture AI's future winners, including the 'Fab Four' (Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon), the 'Big Six' (removing Tesla), and the 'Elite 8' (adding Broadcom Inc.). Bloomberg Intelligence projects the Mag Seven will see over 15% earnings growth by 2026, but the rest of the S&P 500 is expected to grow earnings by 13% and revenue by 5.5% next year. 'It is hard to see the current Mag Seven as the best representation of AI,' Smith said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:20 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

He attributes this to strong fundamentals, consistent capital expenditure (capex) spending, and the ongoing AI boom. Woods notes that these eight stocks, including Broadcom, make up approximately 38% of the S&P 500, a historical high, and believes they are poised to continue rising. He specifically forecasts NVIDIA could reach $200 per share by year-end, citing undervaluation relative to earnings. Woods advises investors to 'stick with what\u2019s working' and avoid exiting positions in big tech despite headline risks. He is particularly bullish on the Nasdaq 100 as the top-performing index in Q4. Regarding small caps, represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), Woods remains skeptical, calling them 'fake out' potential due to past disappointments. He suggests their momentum may depend on future Federal Reserve rate cuts and a drop in the 10-year treasury yield below 4%, which could trigger further gains. The key 'x-factor' for Q4 volatility, according to Woods, is the upcoming Supreme Court decision on tariffs, which could rule tariffs illegal and require repayment\u2014potentially disrupting markets. He warns that uncertainty similar to that seen around Liberation Day could resurface.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[morningology.com](https://morningology.com/2025/10/01/magnificent-7-set-to-power-stocks-higher-in-q4-market-expert-says-stick-with-whats-working/)\n\n**AI Threatens to Make Wall Street's 'Seven Magnificent' Stocks a Thing of the Past**\nThe article argues that the traditional Wall Street \"Seven Magnificent\" tech giants\u2014Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla\u2014are losing their dominance as artificial\u2011intelligence (AI) reshapes the market.  Since the launch of ChatGPT, investors have largely focused on these seven stocks, which have accounted for more than 70\u202f% of the S&P\u202f500\u2019s gains since the start of 2023 and represent roughly 35\u202f% of the index\u2019s market value.  Analysts predict that the Seven\u2019s earnings will grow by over 15\u202f% in 2026, supported by a 13\u202f% revenue rise, while the rest of the S&P\u202f500 is expected to see a 13\u202f% profit increase and 5.5\u202f% revenue growth next year.\n\nWithin the Seven, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft have performed best in an AI\u2011driven world, with shares up 21\u202f%\u201333\u202f% this year.  Apple, Amazon and Tesla lag behind, and their future prospects are less clear.  Chris Smith of Antero Peak Group notes, 'Os pr\u00f3ximos vencedores ser\u00e3o aqueles que atuarem em mercados grandes e ilimitados por meio da IA, tornando\u2011se empresas maiores no futuro do que as Sete Magn\u00edficas s\u00e3o hoje.'  He adds that the Seven will not disappear but may be outpaced by new leaders.\n\nWall Street is already creating alternative groupings.  Jonathan Golub proposes a \"Four Fabulous\" set of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon; Ben Reitzes suggests a \"Elite\u202f8\" that adds Broadcom to the Seven; and the Cboe Global Markets has launched a \"Ten Magnificent\" index that includes the Seven plus Broadcom, Palantir and AMD.  Oracle\u2019s shares have surged more than 75\u202f% this year, closing up almost 36\u202f% on September\u202f10, and Palantir has outperformed the Nasdaq\u202f100 with a 135\u202f% rise in 2025.\n\nJurrien Timmer of Fidelity Investments cautions, 'Uma empresa pode se tornar grande demais para ser ignorada\u2026 pode ser que, \u00e0 medida que a hist\u00f3ria da IA evolua, novos vencedores substituam os antigos, mesmo que os anteriores continuem indo bem.'  Nick Schommer of Janus Henderson says, 'Precisamos expandir a conversa al\u00e9m apenas das Sete Magn\u00edficas. A Oracle definitivamente j\u00e1 faz parte disso, e a Broadcom tamb\u00e9m.'\n\nThe piece concludes that as AI expands, the list of winners will shift from foundational tech firms to companies that provide AI\u2011specific services and products, and that the current concentration of market power may eventually destabilize the sector.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 05:37 PM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/financas/noticia/2025/09/28/ia-ameaca-tornar-sete-magnificas-acoes-preferidas-de-wall-street-coisa-do-passado-entenda.ghtml)\n\n**Magnificent Seven Faces Obsolescence as New AI Winners Emerge**\nThe article discusses how the \"Magnificent Seven\" (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla) that dominated the U.S. equity market for three years since the rise of ChatGPT are now showing signs of obsolescence. 70% of the S&P\u202f500\u2019s price gains since the start of 2023 have come from the seven stocks, yet they now occupy only slightly more than half of that share, indicating that the AI\u2011driven trading strategy has broadened beyond the original group.  The piece cites Chris Smith of Artisan Partners, who says the next winners will be companies that \"tackle a large, unconstrained market through AI\" and will likely surpass the Magnificent Seven in size.  Bloomberg Intelligence projects that the seven companies will grow 13% in revenue and 15% in profit by 2026, while the rest of the S&P\u202f500 is expected to grow 5.5% in revenue and 13% in profit.  Within the group, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft have risen 21\u201133% year\u2011to\u2011date, whereas Apple, Amazon and Tesla lag behind.  Smith notes that \"the current Magnificent Seven do not fully embody AI\".  Wall Street analysts propose alternatives such as the \"Fab Four\" (Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon), the \"Big Six\" (excluding Tesla), and the \"Elite Eight\" (adding Broadcom).  However, none of these capture the full breadth of AI\u2011driven gains, as companies like Oracle (75% YTD rise) and Palantir (135% YTD rise) are outperforming the seven.  Julie Timmer of Fidelity Investments warns that \"companies can become huge enough to be ignored\" and that new winners may replace the old ones even if the existing leaders remain strong.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 03:33 PM\nSource:[Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2025-09-28/T3AXOQGQ1YTS00)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasting experts from various financial and economic perspectives largely agree that while risk is elevated for a downturn in the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, Tesla), a coordinated 'bubble pop'\u2014defined as at least four out of seven falling more than 50% from their respective all-time highs before January 1, 2026\u2014is unlikely within the remaining 2.5 months. Key reasons for this consensus include: 1) Historic base rates show that such sharp, synchronized drops in mega-cap leaders rarely happen outside major systemic crises. 2) The group, apart from weaker members like Tesla, Apple, and Amazon, still enjoys robust earnings, high margins, and strong free cash flow\u2014unlike the unprofitable leaders of previous bubbles. 3) While highly concentrated market weights (33-40% of the S&P 500) and extreme valuations have increased fragility and vulnerability, experts note that sector rotation toward new AI winners and divergence among the Seven reduce the odds of simultaneous collapse. 4) There is widespread institutional and media acknowledgment of bubble risks, but this has not translated into panic or capitulation; volatility remains low and sentiment euphoria is not at a peak. 5) The compressed timeframe (less than three months) is repeatedly cited as a strong limitation\u2014such widespread declines typically unfold over longer periods, not weeks. Experts note that a macroeconomic, regulatory, or AI-driven shock could trigger rapid declines but see no immediate acute catalyst on the horizon. Probability estimates for a 'pop' before 2026 are generally modest: most experts assign probabilities between 12% and 34%, with most clustering between 15% and 27%. In summary, experts believe downside risk is higher than typical, but not enough for a coordinated mega-cap collapse (as defined) by the deadline without an unforeseen crisis.",
