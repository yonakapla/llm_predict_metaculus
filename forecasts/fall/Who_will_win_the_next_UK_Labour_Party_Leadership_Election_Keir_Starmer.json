While Labour's polling collapse and Farage\u2019s surge ramp up pressure, they\u2019re more likely to produce protracted anxiety or 'frog-boiling' rather than instant change. NEC control, machinery discipline, and the high MP nomination threshold suggest that unless Starmer himself resigns or a genuine crisis/trigger event erupts, he remains the overwhelming favourite to win any next Labour leadership election. The most plausible base rate is that Starmer\u2014much like leaders post-Brown or Blair\u2014survives at least one serious wobble post-election before any actual threat can coalesce. If a contest does take place (for whatever reason), Starmer still starts as front-runner until a clear, powerful challenger emerges with both the PLP and organizational clout.

Factional discontent is loud but not organized enough to force a contest or meet the 20% nomination threshold from the PLP. Andy Burnham is not positioned to stand due to not being an MP. The upcoming deputy leadership election will indicate factional strength, but unless Powell wins overwhelmingly and the NEC flips swiftly, Starmer is not at imminent risk. The chance of a shock resignation or \u2018coup\u2019 remains low, given the party\u2019s strong institutional interest in stability, Starmer\u2019s controlling the party apparatus, and lack of a unified rival. If a contest does occur soon, Starmer is still the odds-on favorite given membership\u2019s hesitancy to botch a first-term government.

Notably, Burnham, the only widely-cited potential unity candidate, is currently ineligible as he is not an MP. While poor spring elections could heighten existential panic and convert grumbling into a challenge, this would likely require several more months and a further collapse in Labour fortunes\u2014meaning the base rate over the near term still strongly favours Starmer surviving as leader. Thus, although my probability is lower than historical UK PMs at this stage due to current political turmoil, I estimate an approximately 80% chance that Keir Starmer will be the winner of the next Labour leadership election, should one be held as per normal party rules\u2014mainly because he is very likely to still be on the ballot as incumbent if there is a contest, and no obvious leadership alternative exists in a route to oust him swiftly.",

Historically, Labour leaders rarely face or lose leadership contests shortly after a general election win (Wilson, Blair, Brown post-2005; even Corbyn endured through the 2017 midterm). The deputy leadership contest may expose dissatisfaction, but it is not a direct proxy for a leadership election, especially as leading potential challengers are institutionally blocked or lack momentum. If a leadership election does occur in the near term, Starmer retains advantages (incumbency, no catastrophic split, no obvious/eligible challenger, party tendency to prefer stability after winning office). The base rate for a winning Labour leader being ousted quickly post-victory is low. I assign an 85% probability that Starmer wins the next Labour Party Leadership Election (i.e., if and when a contest is held), barring a sudden blackout event (health, explosive scandal, or surprise by-election winner with mass elite defection).

Starmer\u2019s personal mandate from the 2024 general election is still fresh, and Labour\u2019s base rate for ousting recently victorious leaders is extremely low; Blair (1997) and Wilson (1964, 1974) both served years after their wins, and no leader winning power has been removed within 2 years by internal contest in modern times. While the situation is worse than any post-victory Labour leadership of the last half century (given polling and internal discipline), Starmer retains the structural and procedural advantages of the leader in the instant-runoff, member-driven system. The party\u2019s rules mean Starmer is automatically nominated if a contest is triggered, and unless he resigns outright or is forced out by an extra-procedural surge (e.g., mass walkouts, scandal), any contest would almost certainly still see him one of the leading candidates and likely to win by splitting opposition. While I assess elevated risk in 6-12 months, as of now, based on both base rates and my understanding of Labour\u2019s procedures, candidate pipeline, and dynamics, the probability Starmer wins the next Labour leadership election is still notably high\u2014though materially less than 90% due to the confluence of negative political signals. Because of the seriousness of the negative polling and the scale of organized discontent, I will apply a significant discount to the historical base rate (which would be ~95% for a post-GE Labour PM leader). My best-justified probability for Starmer winning the next Labour leadership election, as of 13 October 2025, is 75%.",

Where is the flood of coordinated NEC resignations? Where is the mass CLP defection, or even a plausible pipeline for Burnham? Nowhere. Labour's structure means mutinies take seasons, not news cycles, and members have repeatedly stuck with leaders through electoral ice ages, let alone year-one storms. Even if a contest erupts, opposition is likely to fracture, and Starmer's built-in ballot presence and residual machine advantage make a defeat the outlier, not the default. Your lowball figure would require a perfect-storm, all-at-once collapse\u2014far less likely than inertia winning the day another cycle. Sober up: the base rate isn't a tabloid headline."

Several strong arguments reinforced my own view: a) the lack of a procedurally viable and organized challenger; b) high institutional and organizational hurdles for mounting a leadership insurrection; c) Labour's culture of reluctance to rapidly topple victorious leaders; d) polling and discontent are clear signals of increasing risk, but not automatic triggers for leadership defeat, given rules and party inertia.

Several forecasters convincingly stress (and defend) the decisive impact of the NEC, the delays in counter-elite organization, and the absence so far of a network cascade.

Net Zero sceptic Jeremy Clarkson hints he could take on Ed Miliband at next election | Daily Mail Online**\nJeremy Clarkson, a prominent critic of the Labour Government and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, has hinted he may challenge Ed Miliband, the Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary, in the next UK general election. Clarkson, who was born in Miliband\u2019s Doncaster North constituency, questioned the satisfaction of local voters with their MP and suggested he could run as an independent candidate. Miliband has held the seat since 2005, winning with a 2,370-vote majority in 2019, aided by a split in the right-wing vote between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party. Clarkson has previously expressed interest in politics, notably posting on Twitter in 2013 about potentially standing for Doncaster North. He has voiced strong support for the Conservative Party, praising their 'common sense' at the 2025 Manchester conference and criticizing both Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for economic inconsistencies and Sir Keir Starmer for allegedly damaging the economy through excessive regulation and taxation. Clarkson has also opposed Labour\u2019s Net Zero policies, which Miliband leads.

The trial ended with both men being formally declared not guilty, and the Crown Prosecution Service stated that the government had failed to provide evidence that China posed a national security threat during the alleged offences\u2014despite repeated requests. Starmer insists no minister, including Powell, was involved in the decision, attributing the lack of evidence to the previous Conservative government\u2019s stance at the time. However, former officials have questioned the sudden shift in position, and the Conservative Party has criticized Powell, citing his frequent visits to China and advocacy for stronger UK-China ties.

The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg reported in late September 2025 that 30 unnamed sources across government and the party were consulted to assess Starmer\u2019s political peril, highlighting widespread concerns over his 'flawed' personnel decisions and policy communication. Media magnification is cited as a key factor in eroding Starmer\u2019s appeal, which was never particularly strong to begin with.

Clarkson, who was born in Miliband\u2019s Doncaster North constituency, questioned the satisfaction of local voters with their MP and suggested he could run as an independent candidate. Miliband has held the seat since 2005, winning with a 2,370-vote majority in 2019, aided by a split in the right-wing vote between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party. Clarkson has previously expressed interest in politics, notably posting on Twitter in 2013 about potentially standing for Doncaster North. He has voiced strong support for the Conservative Party, praising their 'common sense' at the 2025 Manchester conference and criticizing both Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for economic inconsistencies and Sir Keir Starmer for allegedly damaging the economy through excessive regulation and taxation.

After attending the Labour Party conference in Liverpool and later participating in fringe events at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Burnham publicly criticized Keir Starmer\u2019s government and advocated for radical changes, including reforms to council tax. Although he claims he is not plotting a return to Parliament, his actions\u2014such as engaging with media, attending high-profile events, and aligning with the newly formed 'Mainstream' faction\u2014have fueled speculation. Burnham is ineligible to run for Labour leader unless he regains a parliamentary seat, as only sitting MPs are eligible. He would need to resign as mayor and trigger a by-election, a move complicated by concerns over Labour\u2019s electoral prospects and resistance from the Labour National Executive Committee (NEC), which is seen as dominated by Starmer allies. However, internal party dynamics may shift: Lucy Powell, a Burnham ally, is the frontrunner to replace Angela Rayner as deputy leader and would gain NEC membership. A potential NEC realignment, driven by dissatisfaction with the current leadership\u2019s direction and fears of electoral losses in May, could open the door for Burnham\u2019s ambitions. Neal Lawson of Compass, a Burnham supporter, has publicly called for Starmer\u2019s removal and declared Burnham 'the best version of himself now' and capable of leading the party and defeating Nigel Farage.

This decision, made during the party\u2019s annual conference in Aberdeen, rejected a rebel amendment proposing a 'de facto' referendum model, where a pro-independence majority in the popular vote would automatically trigger independence negotiations. The amendment, previously advocated by former leader Nicola Sturgeon\u2014who later called it a 'mistake'\u2014was opposed by the leadership and many members, who cited confusion over the SNP\u2019s previous strategy during the 2024 UK general election, when the party lost 38 of its 48 Westminster seats. The shift toward a clear, majority-based platform reflects renewed confidence, as the SNP now leads in the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK. The strategy targets 'soft yes' voters who have drifted from the party. While activists like Graeme McCormick and Tommy Sheppard warned of the SNP\u2019s 'hollowing out' and the need for long-term planning beyond 2026, the leadership maintains that securing a majority under the proportional representation system remains a high hurdle\u2014historically achieved only once, in 2011.

As the SNP prepares for its conference in Aberdeen, Swinney promoted a new government-produced document claiming an independent Scotland would flourish, though it is described as lacking substantive detail and offering no clear solutions on key issues like currency, EU membership, or securing a second independence referendum (Indyref2). The article notes that Swinney inherited a weakened SNP after Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s resignation and Humza Yousaf\u2019s turbulent leadership, which led to a dramatic loss of seats in the 2024 UK general election\u2014dropping from 48 to just nine MPs. Despite this, the SNP remains on track for another Holyrood win. The article criticizes Swinney\u2019s rhetoric, including his claim that a strong SNP result would force Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign, calling it inconsistent and politically self-serving, especially since Swinney himself did not resign after the 2024 general election defeat. His stance on gender identity, particularly supporting self-ID for trans people, is highlighted as out of step with public opinion, with 60% of voters backing the Supreme Court\u2019s biological definition of sex. The author argues that Swinney\u2019s leadership lacks vision and accountability, and while the SNP may achieve a fifth term due to political instability in Westminster and the rise of Reform UK, Swinney does not deserve such a victory given his failure to deliver a credible path to independence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 02:44 PM\nSource:[The Scotsman](https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/euan-mccolm-fifth-term-for-snp-looks-likely-but-john-swinney-does-not-deserve-it-5355745)\n\n**State of the deputy leadership race as ballots open for Labour members - LabourList**\nThe Labour Party's deputy leadership race between Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell entered its final phase as ballots opened on October 8, 2025, with members voting to succeed Angela Rayner as Keir Starmer\u2019s deputy.

Burgon stated that if upcoming elections\u2014including those for the Welsh Parliament, Scottish Parliament, and local councils\u2014follow the trajectory of current opinion polls, Starmer\u2019s departure would be 'inevitable' and this conference would likely be his last.

She concluded that Labour can only reconnect with the working class under a 'new direction' for the party. Johnson\u2019s remarks, the most direct challenge to Starmer\u2019s authority to date, reflect growing internal dissent, especially given her prior clashes with the leadership over policy and discipline.

He denied plotting to return to Westminster but confirmed his ambition to become prime minister, saying 'I stood twice to be leader of the Labour Party. And I think that tells you, doesn't it?'. The article explains Labour\u2019s leadership rules: a contest is triggered only if the leader resigns or the post is declared vacant; MPs can pass no\u2011confidence motions but they have no constitutional effect. A candidate must secure nominations from at least 10\u202f% of the 399 MPs (i.e., 40 MPs) and then either the backing of 5\u202f% of constituency Labour parties (\u224832 CLPs) or support from at least three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions. The winner is decided by a one\u2011member\u2011one\u2011vote system. Burnham\u2019s main barrier is that he is not an MP; until he wins a seat he cannot stand. The article outlines several routes: winning a by\u2011election after a Labour MP resigns, acting as a kingmaker by endorsing a challenger, or waiting until the next general election to stand as an MP. Each route has procedural hurdles and requires alignment of circumstances.

The piece notes that Starmer\u2019s 2024 electoral victory gave him a personal mandate, making a challenge unlikely.

Phillipson, a Cabinet minister, won 116 nominations from Labour MPs, comfortably surpassing the 80\u2011nomination threshold, while Powell, who was sacked as Commons Leader, was three short of the required 80 nominations. Former deputy leaders Emily Thornberry and Paula\u202fBarker withdrew, with Barker endorsing Powell. Bell\u202fRibeiro\u2011Addy failed to reach the 80 nominations and criticised the process, saying 'I am disappointed that the full range of Labour members' views will not be represented on the ballot paper.' The race, which could eclipse Labour\u2019s annual conference, is seen as a test of the party\u2019s direction after Angela Rayner\u2019s resignation. Phillipson is viewed as Downing Street\u2019s de\u2011facto candidate, whereas Powell has backing from Greater Manchester mayor Andy\u202fBurnham, a long\u2011time rival of the Prime Minister.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15089455/Two-horse-race-Labours-deputy-leadership-Keir-Starmer-ally-Bridget-Phillipson-pitted-against-sacked-minister-Lucy-Powell-whos-backed-PMs-long-time-rival-Andy-Burnham.html)\n\n**PM 'trying to 'fix' Labour's deputy leader contest after Rayner exit**\nKeir Starmer is accused of trying to 'fix' the Labour deputy leadership contest after Angela Rayner\u2019s resignation. The party\u2019s NEC is set to decide a successor quickly: candidates must secure 80 MP nominations by 5\u202fpm Thursday, then face a members\u2019 ballot with a winner named by the end of October, well before the Budget on 26\u202fNovember. Backbenchers such as Richard Burgon have condemned the timetable as the \u2018mother of all stitch\u2011ups\u2019, arguing it sidesteps serious discussion of Labour\u2019s failures. Potential candidates include Emily Thornberry, Lucy Powell, Louise Haigh and Shabana Mahmood, while Labour peer Baroness Harman has called for a woman from outside London. The article reports that following Rayner\u2019s resignation, David Lammy became deputy prime minister and Steve Reed took the Housing portfolio. It also notes Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham\u2019s concerns about London\u2011centricity and the need for a northern voice. The piece quotes Burgon, Thornberry, Harman and others, presenting multiple viewpoints without overt editorializing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 09:28 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15076333/Starmer-Rayner-Labour-PM-deputy-leader-MPs-Left.html)\n\n**The race for Labour vice\u2011leadership opens after Angela Rayner's resignation | Invezz IT**\nAngela Rayner\u2019s resignation as Labour Party deputy leader and deputy prime minister has triggered a high\u2011stakes internal election to fill the vacancy, reopening divisions over the party\u2019s direction.  Rayner, long seen as a future leader, stepped down on Friday after an independent ministerial interests adviser found she had breached the code by under\u2011paying stamp duty on her Hove flat.  Her departure removes a key voice from the government\u2019s top tier and forces Labour to contest the vice\u2011leadership, though the winner will not automatically become deputy prime minister \u2013 that role is already held by David Lammy following this week\u2019s reshuffle.  The contest comes at a fragile moment for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had promised a \u2018second phase\u2019 of a government reset only days earlier, but public opinion has turned against him.  A YouGov tracker in August recorded Starmer\u2019s approval at 24% versus 68% disapproval.  Within the party, a Survation poll last month showed 64% of Labour members believe the party is heading \u2018in the wrong direction\u2019, with Starmer\u2019s net favour dropping to \u20139.  Rayner\u2019s exit may embolden the left wing of the party to push for a vice\u2011leader who mirrors the left\u2011leaning balance of Starmer\u2019s leadership.  The National Executive Committee will soon set a timetable for the election.  Under current rules, candidates must first secure nominations from 20% of Labour MPs (80 in total), then obtain support from 5% of electoral parties and three affiliates, at least two of which must be trade unions.  Once nominated, Labour members and affiliates will vote in a preferential ballot.  Potential candidates include Shabana Mahmood, the new Home Secretary and a close ally of Starmer, who is credited with shaping Labour\u2019s electoral strategy; Ed Miliband, former party leader and current energy secretary, who holds a net score of +74 in a recent Labour List poll; Emily Thornberry, chair of the foreign affairs committee, who has a strong veteran profile; and Wes Streeting, health secretary, who has a net rating of +9 and narrowly retained his seat in the July general election.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 10:28 AM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/it/notizie/2025/09/06/la-corsa-alla-viceleadership-laburista-si-apre-dopo-le-dimissioni-di-angela-rayner/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts, there is a strong consensus that Keir Starmer remains the most likely winner of the next UK Labour Party leadership election. Experts consistently highlight significant barriers to ousting a sitting Labour leader who has recently led the party to a general election victory. These include high procedural thresholds for challenging the leader (20% of MPs needed), Starmer's control of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and party machinery, the lack of a credible, eligible alternative (notably, Andy Burnham is not an MP), and the party\u2019s historic inertia following election wins. \n\nHowever, all forecasters acknowledge increased risks compared to past post-victory periods due to Labour's polling collapse (with Reform UK surpassing Labour in some polls), internal criticism from both the left and centrist factions, and open media speculation about Starmer\u2019s future. Most experts assign additional risk if the party performs disastrously in upcoming local or devolved elections (e.g., in 2026), but note that even in these scenarios, triggering and organizing a contest \u2013 let alone finding a unifying challenger \u2013 is difficult. \n\nTypical 'no' scenarios involve a catastrophic party collapse, successful unification of opposition factions, or Starmer resigning, none of which appear imminent. The more probable path remains either no contest taking place for some time, or a contest being called in which Starmer, as incumbent and automatic nominee, faces a divided opposition and wins. Only one expert, focusing on leadership traditions, assigns a much lower probability (20%) to Starmer\u2019s survival, but this is weighted toward the logic that if a contest occurs at all, it likely follows terminal political decline; even then, the lack of a clear alternative tempers the risk.\n\nExperts\u2019 assigned probabilities generally range from 68\u201389%, coalescing around 75\u201385%. There is a shared recognition that while Starmer\u2019s leadership is more vulnerable than is typical for a newly elected Labour PM, the party\u2019s institutional design and current political realities make him the clear favorite to win any forthcoming leadership election barring an unforeseen acute crisis.",
