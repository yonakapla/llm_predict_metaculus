However, fundamentals from an investment cycle perspective show risk of topping out. Historical base rates suggest that after reaching post-halving heights (now around $126k), Bitcoin rarely doubles again before cycle exhaustion/major correction (last two bull markets saw ~3-5x from previous lows, with post-ETF euphoria but rarely outright doubling in the late stages). Macro risks (trade war, equity correction, sudden regulatory backlash, big liquidation cascades) remain elevated. On a day-to-day basis, a wick to $200k is possible on extreme FOMO or a specific institutional buying event, but the probability is fundamentally limited by both the maturity of this bull cycle and by the sheer capital required to achieve and sustain that price. Given the base rate of Bitcoin doubling within a few months of new highs is low, but considering this cycle's unprecedented institutional flows and the relatively open policy environment, the chance of a blowoff top to $200k is non-negligible yet substantially less than 50%.

Portfolio theory would argue against anyone betting the farm on this; a diversified approach recognizes the non-trivial possibility of both a blow-off and a severe dump. My estimate is therefore elevated\u2014reflecting BTC's unique propensity for extreme moves in response to both endogenous (crypto-native) and exogenous (macro/political) catalysts\u2014but not at an extreme due to the proximity to the end of the cycle, growing evidence of heightened volatility, and headwinds from trade war risk and equity market fragility.

Realistically, the $200K mark would likely require both an explosive final reflexive rally (akin to late-2017 or early-2021 viral cycles) and at least one major new bullish catalyst (Fed, sovereign demand, or a global fiat wobble).

Empirically, after halving cycles, Bitcoin typically appreciates 3-5x from cycle low (2022-2023), but historical peaks tend to occur within a tight window post halving\u2014i.e., Q2 to Q4 in the following year. Standard Chartered, bullish analysts, and technical traders see the possibility for $150k-200k in blowoff top scenarios, and there is real risk that ETF-driven FOMO could resume if the recent pullback is absorbed. However, there are material headwinds: 1) A major pullback has already struck, with volatility high and tens of billions in liquidations; 2) Macro/geopolitical shocks could easily trip more risk-off cascades, especially if S&P500 or global stocks drop; 3) Q4 has historically shown severe corrections after parabolic runs and current price is already 28-30% up YTD; 4) No explicit evidence YTD of the U.S. executing Bitcoin reserve purchases in size. All told, the hurdle is high: another 60-70% move from here, in a two-month window, against a rising backdrop of volatility and uncertainty. While possible, especially if a new momentum burst occurs, the balance of factors as of October 13, 2025 places the probability somewhat below the market super-bull narrative, but not negligible due to new dynamics (ETF capital, state actors, pro-crypto policies). Hence, my forecast is a moderate bullish tilt, toward high but not extremely high probability.",

Technically, Bitcoin is exhibiting exhaust signals: prolonged distribution near the $120k-$125k range, sharp post-ATH corrections, and lack of parabolic momentum or new inflow surges in the weeks following recent highs. Classic bubble patterns show that the final 'melt-up' typically features accelerating volume and daily price amplification\u2014neither of which is currently present at scale. Macro conditions are more mixed than euphoric, with trade war jitters repeatedly triggering long-liquidations and sudden volatility spikes. In short, the likelihood of a sustained or even single-day $200k high depends on an unseen fresh catalyst (e.g., sudden sovereign buying or a wild ETF-driven FOMO), and given observed price fatigue, the probability for a true late-cycle blowoff should be materially lower than 1-in-3.

The technical context for blowoff tops generally includes harmonized, euphoric inflows across both retail and institutional segments, but the current market shows hesitancy, high volatility, and sensitivity to negative macro shocks (trade war, regulatory incidents). As well, ETF inflows have plateaued, and while volatility supports the theoretical possibility of a 'one-day print,' the capital required for that move with current liquidity is extreme, barring an exogenous shock. The scenario construction, while plausible, gives too little weight to familiar cycle topping patterns and too much to tail events.

From a volatility assessment perspective, Bitcoin's present regime is characterized more by macro-driven shock events and elevated two-way risk (large, fast drawdowns, not pure melt-ups) than by the kind of unidirectional parabolic blow-off seen in early-stage manias. Historically, moves of +60% above a late-cycle ATH with this level of open interest and institutional ownership are exceedingly rare; the statistical base rate, even factoring in liquidity gaps and 'wick risk,' sits far lower. The recent tariffication shocks, a 12\u201315% correction from highs, and still-meaningful event-linked plunges all point to a structurally fragile but not explosively bullish market. In addition, the assumption of reflexive FOMO ignores the evidence of ETF inflow deceleration and event-driven liquidity drying up when volatility spikes.

In crypto, markets may not always price in the full extent of political risk or (conversely) the capacity of regulatory greenlights to unlock new, previously sidelined capital. Furthermore, historical precedent shows that even in mature, liquid markets, asset price extremes can result from sudden changes in the compliance or risk-mitigation landscape\u2014especially when rule or policy shifts create a feedback loop of new flows. In effect, while the forecast sensibly weighs the information set, it is somewhat overly conservative about the vulnerability of price to regulatory regime shocks and underestimates right-tail risks associated with less liquid, sentiment-driven parabolic markets.

The EMH lens suggests that the informational utility of halving, regulatory stance, and ETF flows is already highly discounted into price, making further surprise-driven appreciation more difficult absent truly non-incremental developments. Additionally, the scale of capital required to propel Bitcoin from $125k to $200k\u2014especially after evident distribution and repeated macro-driven sell-offs\u2014suggests that reflexive spikes, while possible, become less likely as market size increases and volatility regime matures. While new ETF inflows, state buying, or black swan events could produce a melt-up, the absence of current exponential demand growth (ETF inflows have plateaued) argues for a more tempered tail probability. In sum, while the scenario mapping is sound, the odds may overstate: they seem to underweight the resistance posed by late-cycle signals, behavioral fatigue, and the liquidity wall at $150k+, which repeated attempts have failed to overcome, all of which would support a probability perhaps closer to 20-25%."

Additionally, the model recognizes that previous cycles' blowoff tops were typically characterized by unbridled exuberance and retail FOMO at a time when institutional participation and circuit-breaker mechanisms were less influential.

You also correctly incorporate the diminishing marginal impact of ETF flows and the rising influence of macro shocks, which neutralize the likelihood of an unchecked blowoff. While my own perspective spotlights the possibility of bubble reflexivity tilting the odds upward, your reference to capital requirements, sector-wide hesitation, and historical correction timing is a fundamental check on bubble enthusiasm. In short, your more moderate probability is justified by the observable limitations on new buyer power and the mounting cycle fatigue, making a parabolic extension to $200k statistically and structurally challenging without a new narrative shock or policy intervention."

From a computer science and protocol perspective, extreme price moves hinge not only on technical/network events but also on increasingly market-structure-driven shocks: ETF inflows, liquidations, macro cross-currents, and the sheer scale of capital now needed. The portfolio diversification lens emphasizes prudence\u2014Bitcoin's unique non-linear payout profile justifies a nonzero, but not extreme, tail estimate. Your 23% chance is well-calibrated: it acknowledges that modern market microstructure and institutional adoption have raised the floor while historical parabolic extensions become less likely as base rates compress late in the cycle. Crucially, you resist extrapolating from prior cycles without consideration of current liquidity and volatility regimes, yet leave room for Bitcoin's distinctive right-tail. In summary, your approach demonstrates the value of cross-disciplinary, risk-adjusted thinking in sizing highly uncertain but impactful scenarios."

From a cryptographic security analysis perspective, regulatory architecture is a critical dimension: not only do deregulatory waves (like the Trump administration's) increase institutional comfort and unlock new flows, but they also reshape the threat surface for systemic failures or fraud\u2014meaning that regulatory signals directly affect both inflows and the tail probability of downside cascades. The estimate of a 28% probability is well-calibrated, balancing evidence that market structure now permits sudden melt-ups (due to ETF and government participation) with the knowledge that key bullish narratives (strategic reserves, full-throated regulatory support) are at least partially priced in. The analysis is especially strong in recognizing that one high-volatility session, not a regime shift, is sufficient for YES, so macro/policy tail risk justifies a substantially nonzero estimate. The regulatory perspective rightly values the feedback between compliance changes and existential price movements in semi-mature markets\u2014this is an analytical strength rarely found in purely technical, economic, or even market-structure frameworks."

As someone focused on China\u2019s financial-macro interplay, I agree that macro-driven shocks (in particular, geopolitical/liquidity crises stemming from US-China trade war, capital controls, or a swift policy reversal) are more likely to trigger high-magnitude selloffs than coordinated FOMO-driven melt-ups at the current price tier. The probability given (13%) is appropriately cautious: it recognizes that while ETF and institutional inflows justify elevated right-tail risk relative to past cycles, the lesson from October\u2019s liquidation events and sharp price reversals is that late-cycle markets are structurally prone to sharp bid-loss and de-risking. Additionally, such an approach aligns with my China-based framework: cycles most vulnerable to exogenous shocks and instability typically fail to sustain (or even achieve) surprise vertical rallies, especially when new capital inflow momentum is decelerating and macro risks are rising. Thus, the assessment offers a disciplined counterpoint to more exuberant bubble-based estimates, and is a strong representation of risk management in practice."

My critique of the 'Speculative Bubble Theory' view underscores that, even with cryptocurrency\u2019s history of large end-of-cycle spikes, the technical evidence this cycle actually points toward exhaustion, not ignition. Institutional inflows have become less explosive, there is no sign of new parabolic momentum, and the weight of macro risk and past cycle base rates both argue against a doubling from current ATHs so late in the year. The marginal new information from group deliberation (higher estimates among volatility-tuned and bubble-theory forecasters) moderately highlights upside tail risk, but does not add a new concrete catalyst.

The absence of panic ETF inflows, clear distribution above $120k, and macro headwinds remain strong brakes on a melt-up. However, there is broad agreement (even among skeptics) that the structural tail risk in crypto, especially with US policy, ETF capital, and structural illiquidity, justifies a bolder probability than the single digits of past cycles.

Importantly, supply/demand and behavioral finance analyses emphasize the currently plateaued ETF inflows and event-driven volatility spikes, suggesting present conditions are not aligned for a fresh, sustainable FOMO melt-up to $200k. My own risk management perspective\u2014focused on portfolio flows and cycle-based risk\u2014remains valid, but the group consensus, especially rigorous critiques of the upper-end probabilities, suggest a modest adjustment downward is appropriate. The probability of a single $200k daily high by year-end seems a bit less likely than my initial estimate, in part because the required move has not begun and there is little evidence of fresh momentum or new, decisive institutional catalysts since early October.

Notably, no dominant new arguments or evidence emerged to justify a dramatic upward or downward revision\u2014bubble-scenario forecasters advocating >30% seem to overstate structural tail risk given the fragility and event-driven reversals now visible, while more conservative takes (10-23%) risk undervaluing crypto\u2019s propensity for surprise parabolic moves catalyzed by regulatory or macro shifts. My regulatory-compliance lens suggests that right-tail risk remains higher than pure base rate models due to still-possible policy or product (ETF/rule) shocks, but not so high as to breach 33%.

The discussion of market structure and supply/demand dynamics reinforces my caution about a parabolic move, but also supports a slightly higher probability than my initial estimate due to the non-trivial right-tail risk of a blow-off top. While I am not as high as the 27-35% camp, the probability that a 'wick' above $200k occurs, even briefly, is a bit higher given ongoing volatility, ETF/fund flows, and the unique, event-driven nature of late-cycle crypto.

Only two forecasts (besides mine) sit at 33-35%, and most critiques targeted these higher estimates as somewhat inflated, given both the observed exhaustion in price action and lack of runaway ETF inflows or clear new sovereign demand. The defense of the cryptographic/market-structure perspective highlighted the plausibility of a volatility-driven spike, but given credible pushback around plateauing inflows, persistent resistance above $125k, and cycle top risk, the group consensus suggests a modest move downward is warranted. However, the unique late-cycle risk profile, liquidity thinness, and a true 'one-day print' threshold justify remaining somewhat above the cluster median, especially given recent sudden liquidations and the ever-present possibility of a hedging/forced buying episode.

Despite the bearish short-term trend, speculation is growing that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2024, which could boost demand. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has expressed commitment to advancing the U.S. crypto industry, and President Donald Trump has signaled plans to position the U.S. as a global crypto hub. Multiple U.S. banking institutions have pending XRP ETF applications, with approval potentially triggering a cascade of similar filings. Technical analyst MikyBull on TradingView identified bullish chart patterns, suggesting a potential breakout, and advised accumulating XRP at $2.80 for strong future gains, noting the asset is currently trading below that level. Long-term forecasts, such as those from CoinCodex, project XRP could reach $9.36 by December 2030\u2014a rise of over 230%\u2014though current technical indicators show a bearish outlook and the Fear & Greed Index stands at 70, labeled as 'greed.'

Experts Weigh In on the Cryptocurrency's Future**\nThe Bitcoin price surged past $100,000 in December 2024, driven by Donald Trump's election, the introduction of U.S. index funds, and the fourth halving. It subsequently rose to over $110,000 in May 2025, surpassed $120,000 by late July, and reached a new all-time high of $126,000 in early October 2025. A temporary 15% drop followed due to new U.S. tariffs, but the price rebounded above $110,000. Analysts like Simon Peters believe the rally could continue, citing historical trends: October has been a strong month for Bitcoin since 2013, with a 14.4% average gain and 10 out of 13 positive months\u2014earning it the nickname 'Uptober.' Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin could exceed $150,000 by New Year\u2019s 2026 and even reach $200,000 by year-end, citing factors like dollar depreciation, inflation, and strong U.S. stock markets. However, Thibault Desachy of Coinhouse warns that the current bull cycle may be nearing its end, noting Bitcoin\u2019s historical 35-month cycle from trough to peak\u2014suggesting a potential peak around October 20, 2025. He anticipates a correction to $40,000\u2013$50,000, a 70% drop, if U.S. stock markets decline. Arthur Hayes of BitMEX argues the old cycles are obsolete due to institutional inflows, particularly from ETFs, which have reshaped market structure. Long-term, Cathie Wood and Coinhouse believe Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030, driven by national reserves (e.g., U.S., China, Brazil) and bank adoption. Bitpanda\u2019s co-CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad predicts French banks will offer Bitcoin in branches by 2030 due to public demand. Experts foresee Bitcoin evolving into a stable, low-volatility safe-haven asset like gold, decoupling from U.S. equities over time.

By 2025, Trump had become a central figure in the crypto industry, leveraging his political influence to promote U.S. leadership in digital assets. His campaign and inaugural committee received $18 million from the crypto sector, according to The New York Times. The family launched World Liberty Financial (WLF), issuing the $WLFI token valued at $4.9 billion and the USD1 stablecoin\u2014fifth largest in the market\u2014with over $2.6 billion in value. The stablecoin was launched amid regulatory debates and during a market surge reaching $300 billion. Critics, including American University law professor Hillary Allen, warn that the Trumps are creating unbacked crypto assets, enabling unchecked fundraising. Major investors include Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun ($75 million) and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX, which used USD1 to invest $2 billion in Binance\u2014facing SEC charges for illegal operations and money laundering. Trump Media, the president\u2019s company, filed with the SEC for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin and multiple top assets, including the obscure Cronos token, which gained attention due to donations from its parent company, Crypto.com, to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee. Trump\u2019s children are deeply involved: Eric Trump joined the board of Metaplanet, a top global Bitcoin holder, co-founded American Bitcoin (now valued at $6.5 billion), and partnered with ALT5 Sigma to raise $1.5 billion for $WLFI tokens. Donald Jr. invested in Thumzup, a social media ad firm aiming to accumulate Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration has advanced pro-crypto policies: hosting the first U.S. crypto summit, proposing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, enacting stablecoin regulation, and opposing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Key appointments include Scott Bessent (Treasury Secretary) and Howard Lutnick (Commerce Secretary), with Paul Atkins leading the SEC, which has dismissed numerous industry lawsuits. Experts like Luz Parrondo from UPF Barcelona School of Management warn of regulatory capture and conflicts of interest, noting that public and private roles are blurred. While parts of the crypto industry celebrate the Trump-led momentum, others privately acknowledge that the surge reinforces perceptions of fraud, speculative bubbles, and risks to small investors. This was exemplified by the launch of meme coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA just before Trump\u2019s inauguration, which saw prices spike and then collapse by 82%\u201398%, wiping out investor value. Despite clear conflicts of interest, regulators have remained silent, with Allen concluding that the administration\u2019s regulatory shifts have weakened investor protections and financial system safeguards.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 03:41 AM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/negocios/2025-10-12/el-criptoimperio-de-la-familia-trump-expande-sus-fronteras.html)\n\n**After U.S. Tariff Announcements on China, All Cryptocurrencies Suffer Major Falls**\nFollowing U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting November 1, 2025, global markets experienced a sharp downturn, with U.S. stocks posting their worst drop since April. Cryptocurrencies were severely impacted, suffering massive losses within 24 hours. According to market data, crypto liquidations reached US$9.4 billion\u2014surpassing the peak during the Covid-19 crisis. Bitcoin, which had risen above US$122,000 on Friday afternoon, fell 12% and dropped to around US$110,000 by Saturday, briefly touching US$105,000. Ethereum declined from US$4,365 to US$3,800, a drop of nearly 13%. Despite earlier gains driven by a favorable regulatory environment under the Republican government and expectations of a weaker U.S. dollar due to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, investor sentiment reversed rapidly. The tariff announcement followed China\u2019s new export restrictions on rare earth minerals\u2014critical for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and fighter jets\u2014giving Beijing a strategic advantage. Trump responded by threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and announced parallel export controls on critical software to China. In the midst of the sell-off, Argentina-based crypto wallet Lemon reported a surge in buying interest in non-stablecoins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as users saw the downturn as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin had previously surpassed US$124,000 earlier in the week, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/economia/2025/10/11/tras-los-anuncios-de-eeuu-sobre-aranceles-a-china-todas-las-criptomonedas-sufrieron-fuertes-caidas/)\n\n**Bitcoin price forecast: White House crypto report omitted BTC reserve update**\nThe White House's July 31, 2025, crypto policy report failed to provide updates on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve initiative, despite its initial announcement in March 2025 under the Trump administration. The 166-page report addressed regulation, banking access, and tax reform but omitted any mention of government Bitcoin purchases or expansion of the reserve, disappointing crypto advocates. Nevertheless, Bitcoin (BTC) remained resilient, trading at $118,383\u2014near its all-time high of $123,000\u2014after a modest correction. Market indicators show strong bullish momentum: spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $2 billion in inflows within two days in mid-July, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT managing over $80 billion in assets. Institutional holdings now account for approximately 1.4 million BTC (6.6% of total supply). Technical indicators support optimism: the MVRV ratio is near its 365-day average at 2.2, Bollinger Bands are tightening, and the RSI stands at 42.65, suggesting room for upward movement. A breakout above $119,900 could trigger a rapid return to record highs. Trade volume rose 12% in 24 hours to $70.3 billion, and long-term holding behavior indicates sustained investor confidence. The recently signed GENIUS Act also boosted sentiment by improving stablecoin accessibility. Despite the lack of regulatory clarity, Bitcoin\u2019s price is holding strong amid institutional demand and favorable technical conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[businesstelegraph.co.uk](https://businesstelegraph.co.uk/bitcoin-price-forecast-white-house-crypto-report-omitted-btc-reserve-update/)\n\n**XRP Slumps 11%, Eyes ETF Approval as Bulls Predict 2024 Rebound**\nRipple's XRP dropped 11% last week, closing at just above $2.50\u2014its lowest level in nearly three months\u2014amid increasing selling pressure and concerns about further declines below the $3 threshold.

However, the market crashed within days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on November 1, 2024, that he would impose a 100% tariff on nearly all Chinese goods and apply export controls on critical software. This announcement reignited fears of a U.S.-China trade war, triggering a massive sell-off. In just a few hours, the crypto market lost $20 billion in value, with total losses reaching approximately 10%. Bitcoin dropped from $126,000 to a low of $102,000, while Ethereum fell about 13% to $3,760. Over 99% of altcoins experienced sharp declines, with some losing nearly all value. The market entered a 'wait-and-see' stance, awaiting clearer signals from U.S.-China negotiations. Although Trump later stated that talks with China remain open, the market remained indifferent. Analysts predict Bitcoin\u2019s psychological support level at $110,000, with a potential drop to $70,000\u2013$80,000 considered unlikely due to strong global buying pressure, upcoming regulatory changes, and expectations of a rate cut. Ethereum\u2019s support is seen between $3,600\u2013$3,700. Long-term advice includes avoiding high-risk, low-volume decentralized exchanges and focusing on major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The potential for a 'Santa Rally' before year-end offers hope for recovery, especially if key support levels hold.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 03:29 AM\nSource:[H\u00fcrriyet](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/fulya-soybas/24-saatte-20-milyar-dolar-buhar-oldu-kripto-piyasalari-trumpin-agzina-bakiyor-42981485)\n\n**ETH, BNB, DOGE lead as crypto market cap rebounds to $4T**\nThe total cryptocurrency market capitalization rebounded above $4 trillion on October 13, 2025, following a sharp crash on Friday that erased nearly $500 billion in value. Ether (ETH), BNB, and Dogecoin led the recovery with gains of 10.5%, 13.6%, and 12.5% respectively, while Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK) also rose over 10%. Synthetix (SNX) surged over 100%, briefly surpassing its pre-crash high, and smaller-cap coins like Mantle (MNT) and Bittensor (TAO) gained more than 30%. The crash was triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a 100% tariff on China, aimed at restricting exports of rare earth minerals critical for computer chips. Market instability was worsened by Binance\u2019s front end displaying $0 prices for several altcoins and a depegging of the USDe synthetic dollar due to an internal oracle issue. The market began recovering after Trump stated, 'not to worry about China,' clarifying that the U.S. aims to help, not harm, China. Analysts remain optimistic: Mister Crypto noted Bitcoin is retesting the golden cross\u2014a bullish technical pattern linked to past major rallies\u2014suggesting a potential explosive rise. Crypto trader Alex Becker said there is a 'very high chance' this marks the start of a new bull market, while Samson Mow of Jan3 called it 'time for Bitcoin's next leg up.' Analyst 'Mac' expects only minor upward movement in the short term. Bitcoin is currently trading at $115,585, down 4.9% from the start of the dip and 8.8% from its $126,080 peak on October 6, 2025. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate Ether treasury company, purchased over 128,700 ETH worth $480 million post-crash. Executive chairman Tom Lee called the pullback 'overdue' and a 'good buying opportunity,' while Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor confirmed his company bought during the dip, posting a chart to X with the caption: 'Don't Stop \u20bfelievin.' No other Bitcoin-holding companies confirmed purchases or sales over the weekend, according to BitBo's Bitcoin Treasuries data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 12:02 AM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eth-bnb-doge-surge-crypto-recovers-flash-crash)\n\n**How High Can Bitcoin Go?

Trump warned of China's growing hostility, particularly regarding export controls on rare earth elements, and stated he would be forced to respond financially as U.S. President. His remarks triggered a market sell-off, aligning with a drop of over 500 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Ethereum (ETH) also declined, falling below $4,100 and testing support near $4,000, with analysts warning of potential further downside if the trend continues. Despite the broader market downturn, privacy-focused altcoins Zcash (ZEC) and Litecoin (LTC) maintained gains: ZEC rose 23% over 24 hours, trading near $236 after briefly surpassing $269, while LTC reached a high of $135, driven by speculation around spot ETF approvals. Analysts remain optimistic about BTC and altcoins, citing potential catalysts such as spot ETF approvals, Federal Reserve rate decisions, U.S. government funding impasses, and geopolitical tensions, including the fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire.

Trump posted on Truth Social warning that China\u2019s actions\u2014particularly regarding rare earth export controls\u2014could prompt financial retaliation, creating market anxiety. This led to a sharp decline in equities, including a drop of over 500 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which in turn triggered a sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin\u2019s price test of $117,665 on Coinbase followed a prior attempt to reach $122,600. Ethereum mirrored Bitcoin\u2019s decline, falling over 3% and testing support near $4,000. Despite the downturn, major cryptocurrencies remained near key support levels. In contrast, privacy-focused Zcash (ZEC) and Litecoin (LTC) maintained gains: ZEC rose 23% to $236 (peaking at $269), driven by strong momentum in privacy coins like Dash (DASH), Tornado Cash (TORN), and Decred (DCR). Litecoin climbed to a high of $135, with bulls targeting $200 short-term and long-term goals above $400 and the psychological $1,000 level.

Over 1.62 Million Traders Liquidated Amid Cryptocurrency Meltdown**\nIn the context of unpredictable U.S. tariff policies and a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown, the highly speculative cryptocurrency market experienced a sharp downturn on October 11, 2025. Bitcoin plunged nearly 15% at one point, Ethereum dropped over 20%, and smaller-cap cryptocurrencies also suffered steep losses. The rapid decline triggered over $19 billion in global futures contract liquidations within 24 hours, affecting 1.62 million traders, with 90% being long-position liquidations. Analysts attribute the crash primarily to the U.S. misuse of tariff 'sticks,' especially after former President Trump threatened to raise tariffs in response to stricter global rare earth export controls, fueling fears of worsening trade tensions. Additionally, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and cautious signals from Federal Reserve officials contributed to market instability. Despite Bitcoin's earlier surge\u2014rising from around $95,000 in early 2025 to surpassing $120,000 by October\u2014driven by institutional inflows and growing integration with global financial systems, risk assessments remain high. Hargreaves Lansdown, a UK investment giant, warned that Bitcoin's extreme volatility makes it unsuitable for most investment portfolios, citing its history of extreme losses. Conversely, Deutsche Bank believes that amid accelerating de-dollarization and rising safe-haven demand, Bitcoin could become a key component of central bank reserves by 2030, alongside gold. Gold reserves have exceeded 36,000 tons, and gold prices recently surpassed $4,000. Both Bitcoin and gold ETFs have seen record inflows. Bitwise forecasts a 2035 price target of $1.3 million for Bitcoin, driven by institutional demand and its fixed supply, projecting a 28.3% annual compound growth rate over the next decade\u2014far exceeding traditional assets like stocks (6.2%), bonds (4.0%), and gold (3.8%).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 07:24 AM\nSource:[\u626c\u5b50\u7f51\uff08\u626c\u5b50\u665a\u62a5\uff09](https://www.yangtse.com/news/ch/202510/t20251011_274965.html)\n\n**Bitcoin Reaches New All-Time High of $125,000 Amid Surge in Institutional and Global Adoption**\nOn October 5, 2025, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $125,703, surpassing its previous peak of $124,533 set on August 14, 2025. The price had previously corrected below $108,000 before recovering. October has historically been a bullish month for crypto markets, with price increases in 10 of the last 12 years\u2014coined 'Uptober'\u2014and Bitcoin already showed an 8% monthly gain within the first five days of October 2025. Key drivers include expectations of currency devaluation, Federal Reserve rate cuts (with near 100% market confidence in another cut by month-end), and concerns over the independence of the U.S. central bank under pressure from President Donald Trump to ease monetary policy despite inflation above the 2% target. These factors are expected to increase U.S. money supply\u2014already at a record high\u2014further eroding the dollar\u2019s purchasing power. Institutional adoption is accelerating: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted over $3.2 billion in net inflows in one week, and total net inflows since their January 2024 approval have surpassed $60 billion\u2014also a record. Additionally, global adoption is rising: following a directive by U.S. President Donald Trump to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, countries including El Salvador, Bhutan, the UAE, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan have either adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset or are moving toward doing so.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[Overclockers.ru](https://overclockers.ru/blog/kosmos_news/show/240317/Bitkoin-dostig-novogo-istoricheskogo-maksimuma-v-125-000)\n\n**The Crypto State**\nThe article \"The Crypto State\" reports that the cryptocurrency market has rebounded after the 2022 crash, with Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 for the first time in December 2024 and the overall crypto market cap rising from $1.7\u202ftrillion at the end of 2023 to $3.5\u202ftrillion in December 2024 before settling near $2.8\u202ftrillion in early 2025.  The surge was driven in part by the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange\u2011traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024, which attracted about $36\u202fbillion in inflows and lifted BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF to $60\u202fbillion.  The article notes that the Trump administration has pursued a pro\u2011crypto agenda, including an executive order creating a digital\u2011asset working group, dropping investigations into OpenSea and Robinhood, and exempting meme coins such as $Trump from SEC oversight.  It also describes the proposed GENIUS Act, which would lightly regulate stablecoins, and the plan to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that would act as a \"digital Fort Knox\" for the currency.  Lobbying spending by the crypto industry is highlighted, with $133\u202fmillion spent by super PACs in 2024 and $22\u202fmillion in 2022 to defeat tax\u2011reporting proposals.  The article quotes critics such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said, 'Republicans are setting the stage for the richest man in the world to issue his own currency that competes with the US dollar.'  It concludes that the mainstreaming of crypto could increase systemic risk, especially through stablecoins, and that a failure could trigger a run similar to the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse.  The piece is heavily analytical, citing market data, regulatory actions, and political developments, and it frames the Trump\u2011era crypto policy as a significant shift toward deregulation and state endorsement of digital assets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[portside.org](https://portside.org/2025-08-25/crypto-state)\n\n**The US could become a global hub for cryptocurrencies. Here's why**\nAccording to FXStreet, the United States is positioning itself as a global cryptocurrency hub under President Donald Trump. The article cites several policy moves: the GENIUS Act, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Trump\u2011backed ventures such as World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and the meme coin Official Trump (TRUMP), and regulatory appointments that shift the industry away from the Biden\u2011era crackdown. Bitcoin reached a record high of $76,400 on November\u202f6,\u202f2024, the day after the election, and later $109,588 on January\u202f20,\u202f2025, the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Crypto\u2011linked stocks such as Coinbase and Strategy rose alongside the price surge. The SEC Chair Gary Gensler resigned on November\u202f21,\u202f2024, a move that \u2018had a positive impact on the crypto markets,\u2019 according to the article. WLFI tokens are now worth $460.42\u202fmillion, and the project\u2019s stablecoin USD1 is 1:1 backed by the U.S. dollar. The Trump Media and Technology Group filed for a Bitcoin ETF, and the Official Trump coin reached a peak market cap of $8.79\u202fbillion, later falling to $1.62\u202fbillion. The U.S. Department of Justice seized more than $225\u202fmillion in crypto fraud, and the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center reported $5.8\u202fbillion in losses in 2024. State\u2011level initiatives such as New\u202fHampshire\u2019s HB\u202f302, Arizona\u2019s HB\u202f2749, and Texas\u2019s SB\u202f21 create state\u2011run Bitcoin reserves. The GENIUS Act mandates full dollar reserves for stablecoins and is expected to cement the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance, with analysts projecting USD\u2011denominated stablecoins to represent over 99\u202f% of the market. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in August, \u2018We\u2019re going big on digital assets,\u2019 underscoring the administration\u2019s commitment. The article concludes that the Trump administration\u2019s pro\u2011crypto agenda, combined with regulatory clarity, could make the U.S. a leading global crypto hub.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 02:54 PM\nSource:[FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/the-us-is-becoming-a-global-hub-for-cryptocurrencies-after-trump-came-to-power-202508221430)\n\n**Why 2025 Will Be an Exciting Year for Crypto**\nAccording to 21Shares, 2025 will be an exciting year for the crypto market. Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a strategic reserve by nations and companies. In March 2025, former US President Donald Trump will officially launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the US. Several US states, such as New Hampshire and Arizona, have already passed laws to establish similar reserves, and 17 other states are actively discussing similar proposals. Internationally, Bhutan and El Salvador are also holding significant Bitcoin reserves. Companies such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet are also increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and protection against fiscal instability and fiat devaluation. The experts at 21Shares expect this trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption to continue throughout the year. Additionally, the growth of ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) is driving institutional adoption forward. The managed assets (AUM) of global crypto-ETPs reached a record high of $180 billion by mid-2025, up from $100 billion in December 2024. As regulatory momentum increases, 21Shares remains optimistic. US states are pushing forward laws that allow Bitcoin-ETPs for public fund investments, while the UK is working to lift its ban on retail-ETNs and Japan is proposing reforms to classify digital assets as financial products, potentially making professional crypto-investments more accessible to the general public. Stablecoins are also gaining interest from nations and companies, particularly in emerging markets, as a means of protection against currency fluctuations. The GENIUS Act, a proposed law for comprehensive federal regulation, has bipartisan support in the US and is expected to be implemented soon. Additionally, Hong Kong has introduced a stablecoin sandbox and licensing system, while Thailand is testing a retail-friendly stablecoin on the Baht basis.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 10:03 PM\nSource:[finanzen.net](https://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/devisen/mid-year-review-2025-krypto-ausblick-fuer-den-bitcoin-co-es-wird-noch-spannend-in-2025-14701902)\n\n**Your Weekend Crypto Roundup | August 2025 (Week 1)**\nThe SEC has approved in-kind transactions for Bitcoin and Ether ETPs, allowing authorized participants to transact in crypto assets directly.

The 166-page report addressed regulation, banking access, and tax reform but omitted any mention of government Bitcoin purchases or expansion of the reserve, disappointing crypto advocates. Nevertheless, Bitcoin (BTC) remained resilient, trading at $118,383\u2014near its all-time high of $123,000\u2014after a modest correction. Market indicators show strong bullish momentum: spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $2 billion in inflows within two days in mid-July, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT managing over $80 billion in assets. Institutional holdings now account for approximately 1.4 million BTC (6.6% of total supply). Technical indicators support optimism: the MVRV ratio is near its 365-day average at 2.2, Bollinger Bands are tightening, and the RSI stands at 42.65, suggesting room for upward movement. A breakout above $119,900 could trigger a rapid return to record highs. Trade volume rose 12% in 24 hours to $70.3 billion, and long-term holding behavior indicates sustained investor confidence. The recently signed GENIUS Act also boosted sentiment by improving stablecoin accessibility. Despite the lack of regulatory clarity, Bitcoin\u2019s price is holding strong amid institutional demand and favorable technical conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[businesstelegraph.co.uk](https://businesstelegraph.co.uk/bitcoin-price-forecast-white-house-crypto-report-omitted-btc-reserve-update/)\n\n**Bitcoin Reaches $123,000, Supported by Crypto Week and Regulatory Advances**\nThe price of Bitcoin has broken records, reaching $123,000 on Monday. The increase is supported by the 'Crypto Week', where US lawmakers will debate several bills related to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, closed at $119,967.3 per unit, representing a 1.16% increase. Analyst Tony Sycamore said, 'It's mounting a series of tailwinds', citing strong institutional demand, expectations of higher returns, and Trump's support as reasons for optimism. Gildardo Herrera, director of Strategy and Operations for Latin America at Bitget, explained that the movement was driven by optimism around regulatory advances in the US, with Congress. 'The debate of bills are key to the crypto sector, including the CLARITY Act, GENIUS Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. These measures are expected to bring greater regulatory clarity and attract even more institutional capital to the market,' he said. The price of Bitcoin has increased by 28.3% in 2025 and 160.1% since the SEC approved several Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, have also shown positive behavior. The US House of Representatives will debate a series of bills to provide a national regulatory framework for the digital assets sector, which has been demanding it for a long time. President Donald Trump, who has called himself the 'cryptopresident', has urged monetary leaders to renew the rules in favor of the industry. 'It's been a very, very strong move in the last six or seven days, and it's hard to see where it stops now; it seems that it can easily reach the level of $125,000,' Sycamore said. Bitcoin ETFs have risen by up to 175% since their listing on the stock exchange, while Ethereum ETFs have not been as fortunate, showing a decline since their debut.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/mercados/bitcoin-llego-123-000-dolares-activada-crypto-week-20250714-768162.html)\n\n**Bitcoin on the Brink of a Major Surge: What's Next?**\nBitcoin has seen a significant surge in value, breaking its historical record, amidst political changes, blockchain structural changes, and the influx of large investors. Several key factors have contributed to this growth, including the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the influx of institutional investors, and the accumulation of reserves by El Salvador and Bhutan. The reduction in block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC has also led to a decrease in the supply of new coins, causing the price to rise. The victory of Donald Trump and the nomination of Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency advocate, as SEC head have added to the market's optimism. Historically, after each halving, the price of Bitcoin has increased by 3-5 times, making a potential price of $150,000 in 2025-26 possible. However, the rise in US debt, actions by the Federal Reserve, and global macroeconomic trends may complicate the situation. Key barriers to further growth include the $102,000-$107,000 price range, and the amount of 'hot money' flowing through ETFs will be crucial in determining the continuation of the growth. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and it is recommended to hold a reasonable portion of BTC in a portfolio and be prepared for rapid market fluctuations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 12, 2025 09:07 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/economics/2246207-bitcoin-halving/)\n\n**Bitcoin's Rise: A Global Economic Reality**\nBitcoin has recently surpassed $2.1 trillion in market capitalization, making it one of the richest assets in the world, surpassing tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. According to Visual Capitalist (June 2025), Bitcoin currently ranks fifth in the global list of most capitalized titles, just behind Amazon (~$2.0 trillion), Nvidia (~$2.6 trillion), Microsoft (~$2.8 trillion), and Apple, which leads the list with approximately $3.3 trillion. To put these numbers into perspective, Bitcoin alone represents about 1.3% of the total value of global stock markets, estimated at over $159 trillion (World Federation of Exchanges, 2025). Despite its volatile and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is today an economic entity larger than many national economies, surpassing the nominal GDP of countries like Spain or Mexico. The credit for this rise goes to various factors, including institutional adoption: in January 2024, the SEC's approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs opened the door to large pension funds, banks, and professional investors. Additionally, a political effect: President Donald Trump relaunched the Bitcoin theme in his 2024 campaign and, once back at the White House, signed an executive order to create a 'national strategic reserve in Bitcoin,' promoting the United States as the future 'crypto capital of the world.' A narrative that has also pushed other nations, such as the UK and even China, to publicly declare their possession of BTC reserves (ARK Invest, Glassnode, BitcoinTreasuries.net).\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 23, 2025 02:46 PM\nSource:[Info Data](https://www.infodata.ilsole24ore.com/2025/06/23/quanto-e-grande-bitcoin-rispetto-alle-piu-grandi-aziende-del-mondo/)\n\n**2025: Towards a Democratization of Cryptocurrency Investment?**\nThe year 2025 marks a turning point for cryptocurrency investment, as it becomes more democratized and accessible to a wider audience. Several factors contribute to this trend, including the convergence of economic, technological, and regulatory dynamics. The approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January 2024 paved the way for institutional investors, leading to a significant increase in the price of Bitcoin. After Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election in November 2024, with promises favorable to cryptocurrencies, the price of Bitcoin reached $100,000 in December. In May, it reached a new historical high of $111,878, driven by a renewed optimism around a bipartisan agreement on the project of law regulating stablecoins, expected to be adopted this summer. The ether, the second cryptocurrency by capitalization, also experienced a notable rebound, reaching around $2,500 in late May. However, its price remains around 50% lower than its peaks in late 2024, indicating a partial recovery. The growing interest of institutional investors has played a key role in legitimizing cryptocurrencies for the general public. Heavyweights in asset management, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, have begun to integrate Bitcoin through ETFs following the approval of the first funds of this type in the US in January 2024. BlackRock, which had filed its request in 2023, opened the way for this new form of access, quickly followed by Fidelity and Ark Invest, making it easier for investors to access these digital assets in a safer and more regulated way. A reserve of strategic bitcoins in the US In March, Donald Trump signed a decree aimed at creating a national strategic reserve of bitcoins, confirming his ambition to make the US 'the capital of the world of cryptocurrencies.' This initiative, with strong symbolic value, reinforces the supporters of the integration of Bitcoin into sovereign monetary policies. The US president mentioned five cryptocurrencies he would like to include in this reserve: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. In parallel, the adoption of the FIT21 law (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act) in the House of Representatives contributes to clarifying the rules of the game in the US, defining the respective competences of the SEC and the CFTC on cryptocurrencies. Europe is moving forward with MiCA In Europe, the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation, which came into force at the end of December 2024, aims to provide a harmonized legal framework at the EU level, with common requirements for issuers of digital assets and exchange platforms. This regulatory framework aims to protect investors while encouraging innovation. However, its implementation remains uneven: in France, the AMF has recently deplored a low number of dossiers for the MiCA agreement, mandatory by June 2026. In addition, new access channels and regulated platforms, such as Bitpanda, contribute to opening the crypto universe to a wider and more diverse public. The interest of the general public does not wane. In France, according to the latest survey conducted by Adan with Deloitte and Ipsos, a third of the French people consider investing in 2025, even if the proportion of holders remains stable at 10%. Among them, 94% want to increase their exposure. Despite a delay compared to the UK (19%), the Netherlands (17%), or Italy (15%), the trend is upward, with a 10-point jump in one year in investment intentions.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: June 21, 2025 04:31 PM\nSource:[boursier.com](https://www.boursier.com/crypto-monnaies/actualites/news/2025-vers-une-democratisation-de-l-investissement-crypto-960560.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether Bitcoin will reach $200,000 in 2025 converge on several key themes. The current price as of mid-October 2025 is $110,000-$126,000, following a strong rally driven by unprecedented institutional adoption, spot ETF inflows, and a markedly pro-crypto U.S. regulatory environment under Trump. While the post-halving bull market and ETF-driven momentum have powered Bitcoin to new highs, all experts agree that a further 60%+ surge to $200k within 2.5 months would be historically anomalous and would likely require a sudden, extraordinary catalyst\u2014such as massive sovereign purchases, record ETF inflows, or a global macro crisis driving a speculative blow-off top.\n\nFundamental and technical risk factors temper bullishness: many analysts reference late-cycle indicators (historical base rates show blow-off tops rarely double from recent ATHs late in cycle), recent high volatility with deep drawdowns, the potential for macro/geopolitical shocks (notably the U.S.-China trade war and global equity stress), and signs of bull exhaustion or market fragility. While rapid, parabolic rallies have occurred before, they have tended to happen in the early or mid-stages of bull cycles, not after a doubling from already-high levels and in the shadow of major adverse shocks.\n\nPositive forces include continued institutional and sovereign adoption, a structurally constrained supply post-halving, and the uniquely supportive regulatory regime, which together create the setup for possible feedback loops (retail/institutional FOMO) driving sharp but potentially short-lived price spikes.\n\nAll forecasters weigh both tail risks\u2014extreme volatility could in theory produce a single-day $200k 'High' per resolution criteria, but the probability is kept in check by the maturity of the cycle, high macro uncertainty, and technical/psychological resistance.\n\nForecast probabilities across experts range from 10% (Finance/Asset Valuation) and 13\u201315% (Risk/Volatility, Technicals) to the low/mid 20s% (Behavioral, Regulatory, Diversification, EMH) and the highest at 33\u201335% (Speculative Bubble, Blockchain Tech, Supply-Demand). None assigned greater than 35% likelihood. No expert considers a $200k high likely absent a black-swan level event or final blow-off; most anticipate Bitcoin will end the year well below the threshold, though they acknowledge a non-trivial chance\u2014somewhere between 1-in-10 and 1-in-3\u2014of at least one daily price spike to that level due to the confluence of new inflow mechanisms, political will, and speculative dynamics. Consensus: a $200K BTC in 2025 is possible under a dramatic bullish scenario, but base rates and market structure make it significantly less than 50%.",
