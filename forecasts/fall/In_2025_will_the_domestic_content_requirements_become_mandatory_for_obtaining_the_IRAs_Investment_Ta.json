There is little evidence in the legislative record or reporting of serious discussion about converting the domestic content bonus in Section 48E to a baseline mandatory requirement. The IRS has not suggested regulatory intent to require this in the absence of statutory authority. While a minor risk exists that a late-stage amendment could impose such a requirement as a poison pill or in response to a protectionist push, it is both substantively and politically unlikely, especially in a context where most policy actors are seeking to minimize the scale and scope of green tax expenditures.

This is not just improbable\u2014it\u2019s institutional and political anathema. The proper probability for such a shock is indistinguishable from zero on real-world evidence. Your probabilistic conservatism is misplaced; when all process signals and incentive structures point one way, call it what it is: dead."

The original question opened on 2025-04-10 18:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/36488). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which [expanded](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy) the investment tax credits (ITC) for solar-generated electricity to cover all renewable sources, restored its levels to 30% of the project costs, and extended them through 2032. The IRA also established a [domestic content bonus credit](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/irs-updates-ptc-and-itc-domestic-content-bonus-guidance) of up to 10% for projects whose steel/iron and a specific percentage of their components were made in the US.\n\nIn the wake of the 2024 US elections, Republicans took control of both Houses of Congress and the White House, with President Donald Trump [having expressed interest](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta/#the-ira-under-the-incoming-republican-white-house-and-congress) in reducing IRA spending. At the time of this question, congressional Republicans were working on a budget reconciliation bill to possibly enact tax and spending changes to the federal budget (see the Tax Foundation's updated [Budget Reconciliation tracker](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tax-cuts-2025-budget-reconciliation/)).\n\nIt is important to note that in the House of Representatives, the Republicans hold a slim majority of 220 to 213. In March 2025, a group of 21 Republican representatives [sent a letter](https://www.eenews.net/articles/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits/) to House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith to urge him to phase out rather than eliminate the clean energy incentives of the IRA. House Speaker Mike Johnson [told reporters](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5167829-johnson-inflation-reduction-act-ira-climate-tax-infrastructure/), in regard to repealing clean energy tax credits among other policies, \"It\u2019ll be somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.\" It's important to note, too, that reconciliation bills do not always succeed. In July 2017, for example, Senator John McCain famously [cast](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/senate-health-care-vote.html) a decisive No vote to a reconciliation bill that would have repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36488,\"question_id\":35923}}`",

The law has faced persistent Republican opposition, with efforts to repeal or weaken it dating back to the Trump administration. In June 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R.1, the Budget Reconciliation Act of 2025 (the 'One Big Beautiful Bill'), which cuts funding for Medicaid and SNAP, increases defense and immigration enforcement spending, and prioritizes tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy\u2014while failing to extend enhanced ACA tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that H.R.1 will increase the national debt by $687 billion from 2025 to 2034 and push the cumulative deficit to $4.5 trillion. A federal government shutdown began two weeks prior due to a budget stalemate over the future of ACA tax credits, which expire at the end of December 2025. Democrats advocate for making the credits permanent, while Republicans oppose renewal, citing debt concerns. In 2025, over 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplaces, with 90% receiving federal tax credits that reduced their premiums. The enhanced credits, introduced in 2021 and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act, lowered average premiums by 44%. Without renewal, the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) estimates that average premiums could rise by 114%\u2014potentially doubling\u2014for some, forcing at least 4 million people to become uninsured. The CBO warns that 1.5 million people may forgo coverage due to 'sticker shock' even if credits are restored later. Over 75% of ACA enrollees live in states won by President Trump in 2024, and in states that did not expand Medicaid\u2014such as Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Texas\u2014marketplace enrollment has tripled since the ACA's inception. Nearly 90% of enrollees earn below four times the federal poverty level, with half earning less than twice the poverty level, highlighting the ACA\u2019s critical role for working-class Americans. Public support for extending tax credits is strong: 78% of Americans favor continuation, including 59% of Republicans and 57% of MAGA supporters. In September 2025, 11 GOP House members backed H.R. 5145, a bipartisan bill to extend credits through 2026, though it has not yet been voted on. GOP leader Marjorie Taylor Greene stated on X, 'I'm absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year.' Advocates urge citizens and organizations to contact lawmakers before November 1, when the next open enrollment period begins, to prevent a reversal of healthcare gains. The ACA is described as both a landmark reform and a barometer of national values on whether healthcare is a right or a privilege.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Best Indian American Magazine | San Jose CA | India Currents](https://indiacurrents.com/working-class-americans-hit-the-hardest-if-shutdown-drags-on-with-affordable-healthcare-at-stake/)\n\n**U.S. Lawmakers Racing to Fund Government Before Saturday Deadline Amid Partisan Rift**\nU.S. Senators must approve a government funding bill before Saturday, but deep divisions remain between Democrats and Republicans over the final resolution. With the deadline of March 14 approaching, lawmakers are racing to pass a short-term continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated on Thursday that Democrats appear poised to let the government shut down unless they support the House-passed bill. The Senate requires 60 votes for passage, meaning Republicans need at least eight Democratic votes. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Republicans for drafting the bill without Democratic input, calling it a partisan effort, and emphasized that bipartisan funding should be the norm. Democrats express concern that the Republican bill would empower the Trump administration to make sweeping changes to federal programs and the social safety net. Senator Chris Van Hollen stated he opposes the House Republican bill, arguing it would give Elon Musk excessive tools to dismantle government agencies and serve elite interests. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed voting against the resolution would harm the American people and undermine President Trump\u2019s progress over the past 51 days. The Republican-majority House passed the bill 217\u2013213 on Tuesday, then adjourned, pressuring the Senate to act. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the seven-month continuing resolution advances Trump\u2019s agenda to eliminate government waste through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), calling it a historic moment of reform. However, independent watchdogs and analysts warn DOGE is using broad fraud allegations to justify large-scale federal cuts. Representative Thomas Massie was the only Republican to oppose the bill, despite a public demand from Trump on Truth Social that Massie lose his seat if he voted against it. The continuing resolution provides time for Senate and House negotiators to reconcile their versions, a key step in advancing Trump\u2019s domestic policy agenda.

During President Joe Biden's term, the debt rose at an average rate of over $2 trillion per year. Despite Schumer's recent warnings about the 'biggest debt increase in U.S. history' under the Republican One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA), the article notes his opposition to a House-passed short-term continuing resolution to fund the government, which would have expired on November 21, 2024. The Senate, led by Schumer, blocked the bill, resulting in a government shutdown. Schumer claimed the shutdown was beneficial, citing preparedness for healthcare policy debates tied to the expiration of 'enhanced' premium tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that in fiscal 2025, net interest on the debt exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, nearly nine times the $115 billion spent on the Department of Homeland Security. Federal spending rose from $6.735 trillion to $7.035 trillion, while tax revenues increased from $4.918 trillion to $5.226 trillion, resulting in a $1.809 trillion deficit.

The change, issued under the Trump administration, accelerates the phaseout of clean energy tax credits, prompting criticism from industry advocates who argue it undermines congressional intent as laid out in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, stated the move 'undermines the integrity of our energy grid and our legislative process.' Despite this, the industry expressed relief that the new rules did not impose stricter limits, as a full phaseout was feared. Solar stocks rose sharply, with Sunrun jumping 33%. The Treasury included excusable interruptions\u2014such as severe weather, labor shortages, or equipment delays\u2014allowing four years to complete projects. Analysts like Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James called the outcome 'about as benign as it could have been' given the political climate. Republican senators Chuck Grassley and John Curtis, both supportive of wind and solar, pressed for leniency and maintained holds on Treasury nominees, though Grassley said the guidance 'seems to offer a viable path forward' and Curtis emphasized the need for a 'soft landing' for American energy innovation. The new rules introduce greater uncertainty, with the Treasury retaining discretion in judging whether work qualifies as 'significant' and 'continuous,' raising concerns about financing and project viability, according to Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 15, 2025 11:23 PM\nSource:[insideclimatenews.org](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15082025/treasury-department-wind-solar-tax-credits/)\n\n**Cuts to Wind and Solar May Undermine GOP\u2019s Promise of \u2018Energy Dominance,\u2019 Critics Say - Inside Climate News**\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), passed by Congress in July 2025, has been hailed by Republican leaders and the fossil fuel industry as a key step toward 'energy dominance' under President Donald Trump. Supporters, including Rep. Brett Guthrie and Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, claim the bill advances domestic energy production by expanding oil and gas leasing\u2014particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, onshore, and Alaska\u2014and creating the Energy Dominance Financing program. However, critics, including Dan O\u2019Brien of Energy Innovation, argue the bill undermines long-term energy dominance by cutting incentives for wind and solar projects. O\u2019Brien\u2019s analysis shows the bill could result in a loss of 344 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity\u2014equivalent to the electricity use of 100 million homes\u2014reducing expected U.S. electricity generation by about one-third over the next decade. This loss, he warns, will force older, more expensive power plants to run more frequently, driving up household energy costs by over $280 annually by 2035\u2014a 13% increase. Experts like Samantha Gross of the Brookings Institution and Adam Hersh of the Economic Policy Institute argue the bill prioritizes fossil fuels at the expense of renewable energy, harming both domestic affordability and global leadership in clean energy. Gross notes that the U.S. risks ceding technological leadership to China, while Hersh calls the bill the 'Energy Inflation Act' due to its projected cost increases. Cullen Hendrix of the Peterson Institute for International Economics acknowledges the bill advances fossil fuel output but warns it sidelines the growing renewable sector, resulting in a 'net-negative' outcome. Despite the setbacks, Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners suggests that economic drivers for renewables remain strong, and the transition may be slowed but not halted. The article concludes that while the OBBB reshapes U.S. energy policy, its long-term impacts remain uncertain and may be offset by future regulatory or legislative developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 08:50 AM\nSource:[insideclimatenews.org](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16072025/wind-solar-cuts-could-affect-gop-energy-dominance-promise/)\n\n**Transcript: Sen. Katie Britt on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Oct. 19, 2025**\nSenator Katie Britt, Republican of Alabama, appeared on 'Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan' on October 19, 2025, discussing government shutdowns, healthcare policy, and U.S. foreign policy. She emphasized the need to reopen the federal government, criticizing Democrats for holding the shutdown hostage and stressing that government workers deserve their paychecks. Regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, Britt argued that the ACA is fundamentally broken, with 80% of projected 2026 premium increases tied to the program, and warned against extending tax credits that benefit high-income individuals. She dismissed concerns about 130,000 Alabamans losing insurance, asserting that the real issue is systemic failure, not affordability. On reproductive policy, Britt praised President Trump\u2019s reversal of the 2024 Alabama court ruling that classified frozen embryos as children, stating that the change will make IVF more accessible and affordable, citing personal stories of individuals who previously had to seek treatment overseas. While acknowledging IVF costs ($15,000\u2013$20,000 per cycle), she did not support mandating ACA coverage for IVF, instead promoting broader tax credits like the Working Families Tax Cut and DCAP tax credits to reduce family costs. On foreign policy, Britt expressed support for labeling Russia a state sponsor of terrorism over the abduction of Ukrainian children, noting bipartisan momentum and a scheduled hearing. She credited President Trump with more active diplomacy toward Ukraine than Biden, arguing that these efforts strengthen the push to repatriate the estimated 20,000 children taken by Russia.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 04:50 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/katie-britt-alabama-republican-face-the-nation-10-19-2025/)\n\n**Working-class Americans Hit The Hardest If Shutdown Drags On With Affordable Healthcare At Stake**\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), known informally as Obamacare, has provided millions of Americans with access to affordable health coverage for the past 15 years, protecting over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions from being denied insurance. The law has faced persistent Republican opposition, with efforts to repeal or weaken it dating back to the Trump administration. In June 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R.1, the Budget Reconciliation Act of 2025 (the 'One Big Beautiful Bill'), which cuts funding for Medicaid and SNAP, increases defense and immigration enforcement spending, and prioritizes tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy\u2014while failing to extend enhanced ACA tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that H.R.1 will increase the national debt by $687 billion from 2025 to 2034 and push the cumulative deficit to $4.5 trillion. A federal government shutdown began two weeks prior due to a budget stalemate over the future of ACA tax credits, which expire at the end of December 2025. Democrats advocate for making the credits permanent, while Republicans oppose renewal, citing debt concerns. In 2025, over 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplaces, with 90% receiving federal tax credits that reduced their premiums. The enhanced credits, introduced in 2021 and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act, lowered average premiums by 44%. Without renewal, the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) estimates that average premiums could rise by 114%\u2014potentially doubling\u2014for some, forcing at least 4 million people to become uninsured. The CBO warns that 1.5 million people may forgo coverage due to 'sticker shock' even if credits are restored later. Over 75% of ACA enrollees live in states won by President Trump in 2024, and in states that did not expand Medicaid\u2014such as Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Texas\u2014marketplace enrollment has tripled since the ACA's inception. Nearly 90% of enrollees earn below four times the federal poverty level, with half earning less than twice the poverty level, highlighting the ACA\u2019s critical role for working-class Americans. Public support for extending tax credits is strong: 78% of Americans favor continuation, including 59% of Republicans and 57% of MAGA supporters. In September 2025, 11 GOP House members backed H.R. 5145, a bipartisan bill to extend credits through 2026, though it has not yet been voted on.

The bill, backed by MAGA-aligned forces and supported by Representative Gabe Evans, eliminates clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, jeopardizing solar and wind projects that were expected to qualify only if initiated within 60 days of the bill\u2019s passage\u2014by mid-September 2025. This change threatens future energy expansion and may lead to higher electricity rates, undermining prior efforts to keep utility costs low. The legislation also cuts Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, programs widely supported across party lines, and increases funding for immigration enforcement: $45 billion for detention facilities, $14 billion for deportations, and billions to hire 10,000 additional ICE agents by 2029, raising concerns about lowered hiring standards and racial profiling. Guevara emphasizes that these policies create real fear among families\u2014parents avoid school, students live in anxiety, and workers face exploitation. He attributes Evans\u2019 vote to Trump\u2019s endorsement during his 2025 reelection campaign, accusing him of prioritizing political loyalty over constituents\u2019 well-being.

The Senate rejected a Republican proposal to keep the government open for seven weeks using mostly current spending levels, citing Democrats\u2019 demand for approximately $1 trillion in additional funding to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits and reverse health care cuts from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. All but two Democrats and one independent opposed the GOP plan, leading to the shutdown. Representative Chris Goodlander (D-NH) blamed Republicans, stating, 'This is a crisis of the Republican Party\u2019s creation,' and emphasized that the Republican-controlled White House, Senate, and House are responsible. She criticized Republicans for refusing to extend the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, warning it would trigger a 'death spiral' in health care access. Republicans, including President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, accused Democrats of causing the shutdown by rejecting the GOP plan. A New York Times/Siena poll showed 33% blamed both parties equally, 26% blamed Republicans more, and 19% blamed Democrats more. Goodlander rejected claims that Democrats\u2019 proposal would extend free health care to undocumented immigrants, calling it a 'bald-faced lie' and noting such individuals are not legally eligible. She also advocated for legislation to ensure military personnel, defense workers, TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and other essential workers are paid during shutdowns, and for Congress members to forfeit their pay during shutdowns\u2014neither of which advanced from committee. Essential workers began reporting without pay, and Goodlander requested her own House salary be withheld during the shutdown.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 12:11 PM\nSource:[newhampshirebulletin.com](https://newhampshirebulletin.com/briefs/as-federal-government-shuts-down-over-health-care-spending-goodlander-points-finger-at-gop/)\n\n**Why Trump is not a death knell for global climate action**\nIn a speech to the United Nations in October 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed climate change as 'the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,' contradicting overwhelming scientific consensus. Since his return to office, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, signed an executive order to open 13 million acres of federal land for coal mining, offered hundreds of millions in subsidies for coal projects, removed climate data from government websites, eliminated direct funding for climate science research, and weakened the Inflation Reduction Act\u2014Biden\u2019s key climate legislation. These actions are projected to result in an additional seven billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions compared to a scenario where the U.S. meets its Paris commitments, equivalent to about one-fifth of the global carbon budget for staying under 2\u00b0C of warming. Despite this, global emissions may have peaked and are on track to decline, driven by record global investment in renewable energy\u2014projected to exceed $945 billion in 2025\u2014and a decline in fossil fuel investment. China has responded by setting its first-ever emissions reduction target (7\u201310% by 2035), expanding solar and wind capacity faster than the rest of the world combined, and positioning itself as a climate leader in contrast to the U.S. No country has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement since Trump\u2019s withdrawal, and nations like Australia (under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese) and California (under Governor Gavin Newsom) have maintained or strengthened climate commitments. California has also formed a climate partnership with Brazil ahead of COP30. While the U.S. stance undermines international climate finance and weakens pressure on other high-emitting nations, the global community remains engaged. Negotiators at COP30 face significant challenges, but past COP outcomes show that high-stakes diplomacy can still build momentum for global climate action, potentially pushing the U.S. to re-engage or enabling domestic reform within the country.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 04:29 AM\nSource:[timesofmalta.com](https://timesofmalta.com/article/why-trump-death-knell-global-climate-action.1117969)\n\n**With funding for courts in question, Congress stuck in shutdown gridlock for day 16 \u2022 Georgia Recorder**\nThe U.S. government remains in a shutdown for the 16th consecutive day, with Congress gridlocked and neither the House nor Senate showing willingness to negotiate. The Senate concluded a brief three-day session before adjourning for a long weekend, while the House remains on an extended break. The Judiciary funding lapse has prompted a legal clarification: under the Anti-Deficiency Act, courts may continue operating if necessary to uphold Article III judicial powers, with individual courts determining staffing levels. However, no updates on operations or funding were provided as of October 18, 2025. Federal essential workers are not receiving paychecks, and there is uncertainty about whether they will receive back pay if the Trump administration reinterprets a 2019 law. House Republicans passed a stopgap spending bill funding the government through November 21 without bipartisan input, prompting criticism from Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized that past bipartisan negotiations were essential and accused Republicans of excluding Democrats from decision-making. Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins offered a bipartisan package including funding for biomedical research and infrastructure. Senate Majority Leader John Thune argued that a short-term bill is needed to allow time for full-year appropriations, noting Congress has historically failed to complete these by the October 1 fiscal year start. Democrats insist Republicans must negotiate on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits before reopening the government, while Republicans say talks will only begin after the government is funded. House Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Senate Democrats for the impasse, calling for an end to political posturing. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security continues operations with essential personnel working unpaid, though Secretary Kristi Noem is using funds from the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' to cover Coast Guard pay and operations. The shutdown has disrupted federal services, with officials warning of safety risks and economic consequences, particularly ahead of the November 1 Affordable Care Act enrollment period.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 06:51 PM\nSource:[georgiarecorder.com](https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/10/16/repub/with-funding-for-courts-in-question-congress-stuck-in-shutdown-gridlock-for-day-16/)\n\n**U.S. Lawmakers Racing to Fund Government Before Saturday Deadline Amid Partisan Rift**\nU.S. Senators must approve a government funding bill before Saturday, but deep divisions remain between Democrats and Republicans over the final resolution.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) advocated for a broader deal including extended Advance Premium Tax Credits (eAPTCs), reversal of health care cuts from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, P.L. 119-21), and limits on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) unilateral funding rescission authority. However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) pushed for a 'clean' stopgap bill funding the government through November 21, 2025. The Treasury Department released a contingency plan stating the IRS will remain operational for five business days during a shutdown, with all employees exempt from furlough due to multiyear appropriations from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-169). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) confirmed that layoffs, if implemented, would require 60 days\u2019 notice. Meanwhile, the OBBBA accelerated the phaseout of clean energy tax credits, ending new electric vehicle (EV) tax credits as of October 1, 2025, with the alternative fuel vehicle refueling credit expiring on June 30, 2026. Investors are shifting capital toward clean energy projects that began construction before the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (ITC) expired at the end of 2024. The Treasury and IRS released the 2025\u20132026 Priority Guidance Plan (PGP), prioritizing 105 projects, including OBBBA implementation, tribal tax issues, digital assets, and SECURE 2.0. The PGP also outlines the phaseout of residential clean energy credits after 2025, with wind and solar project deadlines extending through 2027, and the Clean Fuel Production Credit extended through 2029 with stricter domestic content rules. On September 22, the IRS issued proposed regulations for the 'No Tax on Tips' provision under OBBBA, allowing up to $25,000 in qualified tips to be deducted annually from 2025 to 2028, phasing out for taxpayers earning over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers). Eligible occupations include hospitality, food service, entertainment, personal wellness, transportation, home services, recreation, and digital content creators. The public comment period runs until October 22, 2025, with a public hearing on October 23. The Treasury also released Notices 2025-46 and 2025-49 on the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT), clarifying rules for domestic transactions, financially troubled firms, and consolidated groups. The IRS Office of Chief Counsel faces staffing shortages after over 350 attorneys resigned, delaying guidance on OBBBA provisions like tip income and R&D deductions. The IRS is phasing out paper tax refund checks starting September 30, 2025, under President Trump\u2019s Executive Order, though lawmakers from Maine and New Hampshire urged a delay, citing risks to vulnerable populations and rural communities. The IRS has extended a deferred resignation offer to employees on administrative leave for the third time, with no disclosure on the number of acceptances. U.S. multinational companies are urging faster OECD Pillar Two negotiations, warning that delays could impose high compliance costs without a 'side-by-side' exception for the U.S. system. Some countries, including France, Spain, and Kenya, have maintained digital services taxes (DSTs), while India and Canada repealed theirs under U.S. pressure. The Treasury and IRS expect to release four pieces of international tax guidance by year-end, covering FDDEI, controlled foreign corporations, and foreign-earned income credits. The permanent extension of 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA, costing $362.7 billion over 10 years, has drawn criticism from Sen.

It cites a Penn Wharton study that estimated the IRA\u2019s clean\u2011vehicle provisions would cost $393\u202fbillion between 2023 and 2032, making them a target for spending cuts. The piece argues that the credits were doomed from the start because Americans dislike being told what to buy, the rules were overly complex, and the credits mainly benefited high\u2011income buyers \u2013 a point echoed by a Republican National Committee fact sheet that called them \u2018a giveaway to the rich.\u2019 It also notes that the credits were introduced during the Bush administration, expanded under Biden to spur domestic EV manufacturing and compete with China, but were ultimately killed by Trump and a Republican\u2011controlled Congress. The article includes quotes such as \u2018The U.S. consumer is really different,\u2019 said Raul Arredondo, and \u2018It\u2019s not just, \u2018OK, here\u2019s a tax credit.\u2019 It\u2019s, \u2018Here\u2019s a tax credit, and then here\u2019s 100,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations\u2026\u2019 said Chad Cummings, to illustrate consumer attitudes and regulatory complexity.

The author concludes that while the policy setback may temporarily dampen EV sales, the market will eventually adjust as technology matures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 03:34 PM\nSource:[InsideEVs](https://insideevs.com/news/773430/ev-tax-credit-death-cm-tesla/)\n\n**Congress Could Unravel Biden's Climate Law. Here's What To Watch**\nThe Republican\u2011led House passed a large tax and spending bill that would cut or eliminate key subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), potentially raising the cost of clean energy and slowing investment.  The House version removes the 30\u202f% federal tax credit for residential solar systems and for home battery storage, and it scrapes the 30\u202f% credit for companies that lease solar panels, such as Sunrun.  Reuben Ly, a sales manager for A1 Sun in Berkeley, said, \u2018If I could see a knockout punch for solar, it would be if all of a sudden systems got 30\u202f% more expensive and payback times got 30\u202f% longer.\u2019  The bill also ends the $2,000 federal tax credit for high\u2011efficiency electric heat pumps and the $7,500 rebate for most electric vehicles, which would cut the projected EV share of new car sales in 2030 from about 48\u202f% to 42\u202f%, according to research by Elaine\u202fBuckberg.  In addition, the bill adds a $250 charge to EV registration fees and a $100 charge to hybrid vehicles.  BloombergNEF analysts Ethan\u202fZindler and Derrick\u202fFlakoll warned that the IRA\u2019s provisions that bar U.S. projects from using components from China would make it \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for U.S. solar and battery manufacturers to qualify for tax incentives.  Zindler said, \u2018For investors, the message is clear: The U.S. may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago.\u2019  The IRA\u2019s tax credits have already spurred $321\u202fbillion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean\u2011energy facilities, representing 4.7\u202f% of all U.S. private investment in Q1\u202f2025, and an additional $522\u202fbillion of announced investment across 2,217 facilities, which is expected to create more than 680,000 jobs, according to Energy Innovation.  Rhodium Group estimates that repealing the energy tax credits could increase U.S. emissions by at least 500\u202fmillion metric tons to more than a gigaton in 2035.  Senate Majority Leader John\u202fThune said the Senate will write its own version of the bill, but the House\u2019s slim margin may limit major changes.

It notes that the EPA\u2019s proposal to repeal Biden\u2011era power\u2011plant rules would have forced the retirement of nearly all coal plants and discouraged new natural\u2011gas plants, thereby constraining supply. The repeal process involved a 45\u2011day public comment period and review of over 100,000 comments, and legal challenges could delay investment. The piece details recent Interior Department approvals: 30 oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico and six in Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet, plus a plan to extract 14.5\u202fmillion tons of federally owned coal in Wyoming through 2037. It discusses the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" that cuts Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for wind and solar projects that start after July\u202f4\u202f2026 and are placed in service after 2027, arguing that removing subsidies will let market forces determine investment. The article counters claims that rising electricity prices are caused by Republican policies, citing state\u2011level price variations (41\u202fcents/kWh in Hawaii, 26\u202fcents in New\u202fYork, 12\u202fcents in Idaho) and the prevalence of Renewable Portfolio Standards in high\u2011price states.

The change, issued under the Trump administration, accelerates the phaseout of clean energy tax credits, prompting criticism from industry advocates who argue it undermines congressional intent as laid out in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, stated the move 'undermines the integrity of our energy grid and our legislative process.' Despite this, the industry expressed relief that the new rules did not impose stricter limits, as a full phaseout was feared. Solar stocks rose sharply, with Sunrun jumping 33%. The Treasury included excusable interruptions\u2014such as severe weather, labor shortages, or equipment delays\u2014allowing four years to complete projects. Analysts like Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James called the outcome 'about as benign as it could have been' given the political climate. Republican senators Chuck Grassley and John Curtis, both supportive of wind and solar, pressed for leniency and maintained holds on Treasury nominees, though Grassley said the guidance 'seems to offer a viable path forward' and Curtis emphasized the need for a 'soft landing' for American energy innovation. The new rules introduce greater uncertainty, with the Treasury retaining discretion in judging whether work qualifies as 'significant' and 'continuous,' raising concerns about financing and project viability, according to Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 15, 2025 11:23 PM\nSource:[insideclimatenews.org](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15082025/treasury-department-wind-solar-tax-credits/)\n\n**Cuts to Wind and Solar May Undermine GOP\u2019s Promise of \u2018Energy Dominance,\u2019 Critics Say - Inside Climate News**\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), passed by Congress in July 2025, has been hailed by Republican leaders and the fossil fuel industry as a key step toward 'energy dominance' under President Donald Trump. Supporters, including Rep. Brett Guthrie and Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, claim the bill advances domestic energy production by expanding oil and gas leasing\u2014particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, onshore, and Alaska\u2014and creating the Energy Dominance Financing program. However, critics, including Dan O\u2019Brien of Energy Innovation, argue the bill undermines long-term energy dominance by cutting incentives for wind and solar projects. O\u2019Brien\u2019s analysis shows the bill could result in a loss of 344 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity\u2014equivalent to the electricity use of 100 million homes\u2014reducing expected U.S. electricity generation by about one-third over the next decade. This loss, he warns, will force older, more expensive power plants to run more frequently, driving up household energy costs by over $280 annually by 2035\u2014a 13% increase. Experts like Samantha Gross of the Brookings Institution and Adam Hersh of the Economic Policy Institute argue the bill prioritizes fossil fuels at the expense of renewable energy, harming both domestic affordability and global leadership in clean energy. Gross notes that the U.S. risks ceding technological leadership to China, while Hersh calls the bill the 'Energy Inflation Act' due to its projected cost increases. Cullen Hendrix of the Peterson Institute for International Economics acknowledges the bill advances fossil fuel output but warns it sidelines the growing renewable sector, resulting in a 'net-negative' outcome. Despite the setbacks, Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners suggests that economic drivers for renewables remain strong, and the transition may be slowed but not halted. The article concludes that while the OBBB reshapes U.S. energy policy, its long-term impacts remain uncertain and may be offset by future regulatory or legislative developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 08:50 AM\nSource:[insideclimatenews.org](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16072025/wind-solar-cuts-could-affect-gop-energy-dominance-promise/)\n\n**New Law Changes IRA Tax Credits**\nThe President of the United States has signed into law the budget reconciliation bill (H.R. 1, the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act') on July 4, 2025. The bill includes numerous tax reform provisions, particularly affecting tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ('IRA'). Key changes include: projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years for offshore wind); residential solar electric property would not be subject to the rule above; and the fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance would no longer be necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate. The bill also imposes FEOC rules to tax credit qualification, introducing an additional layer of complexity. Treasury would be required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027 applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals. 'The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves,' according to the publication. 'Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 07, 2025 07:54 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-law-changes-ira-tax-credits-1203950/)\n\n**Renewable Energy Update 7.3.25**\nThe Republican budget megabill, which makes significant cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy tax credits, has passed both houses of Congress and is now headed to President Donald Trump's desk.

While clean energy advocates and congressional Democrats argue that the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits, some Republicans wanted to see more significant cuts. 'The final version of the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits,' said congressional Democrats, although no specific quote from a Democrat is provided in the article.

The bill accelerates the expiration of tax credits, with residential solar electric property and ground or groundwater thermal systems remaining eligible for the 6% energy credit. The bill also introduces additional complexity with the imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification.

The IRA provided tax credits and financial incentives for companies to construct American-made energy facilities and made it more affordable for families to install solar panels and high-efficiency electric home appliances. However, Republicans are eliminating these provisions, which would raise household energy costs by 33 percent by 2035, or up to $300 more per household. Senator Heinrich urges Americans to contact their representatives and ask them to leave the IRA provisions in place, working with Democrats to meet the moment and define the country's energy future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 27, 2025 04:14 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/senator-trumps-big-ugly-budget-means-big-ugly-energy-bill-opinion-2091740)\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act Would Significantly Expand Federal Income Tax Benefits for Green Technology Industry**\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expands federal income\u2011tax benefits for green\u2011technology projects.  It extends the existing Section\u202f45 PTC and Section\u202f48 ITC for wind and solar facilities, adds the PTC to new solar projects, and removes sunset provisions for facilities placed in service after\u202f2021.  The Act introduces a new Section\u202f45Y clean\u2011electricity production credit (CEPTC) and a Section\u202f48D clean\u2011electricity investment credit (CEITC) that apply to any renewable or energy\u2011storage facility that begins construction after\u202f2025, with rates tied to a 0\u202f% greenhouse\u2011gas\u2011emissions standard.  Energy\u2011storage facilities gain an election out of the public\u2011utility property limitation and are treated as five\u2011year property under MACRS.  The Act also expands the ITC/PTC to energy\u2011storage, biogas, microgrid controller equipment, and provides a separate PTC for electricity used to produce clean hydrogen under Section\u202f45V.  Wage\u2011and\u2011apprenticeship standards can trigger an 80\u202f% credit haircut, while meeting domestic\u2011content or energy\u2011community standards can add a 10\u202f% (or 20\u202f% for low\u2011income communities) credit enhancement.  The Section\u202f45Q carbon\u2011capture credit is extended to facilities beginning construction before\u202f2033, with a higher rate for direct\u2011air\u2011capture.  Fuel\u2011production credits are extended through\u202f2024 and a new Section\u202f45Z clean\u2011fuel credit is introduced for 2025\u20112027.  The dormant Section\u202f48C investment credit is revived for advanced\u2011energy production and manufacturing, with a $10\u202fbillion ceiling.  The Act creates refundable credits for tax\u2011exempt entities, allows sale of refundable credits, and changes carry\u2011over rules to a 3\u2011year carryback and 22\u2011year carryforward.  These provisions aim to streamline compliance, incentivize domestic content, and broaden financing options for green projects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 04, 2022 12:00 AM\nSource:[morganlewis.com](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/08/inflation-reduction-act-would-significantly-expand-federal-income-tax-benefits-for-green-technology-industry)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts converge on a very low probability that domestic content requirements will become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's Investment Tax Credits (Section 48E) before January 1, 2026. Across tax, legal, policy, administrative, and economic perspectives, every expert emphasizes the overwhelming evidence and recent legislative actions\u2014most notably the Republican-controlled Congress and Trump administration's passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)\u2014which have prioritized repealing, phasing out, or restricting clean energy credits, not imposing stricter eligibility criteria such as a mandatory domestic content requirement. The status quo remains that domestic content compliance is optional for an ITC bonus, not a precondition for core credit access. All major factors\u2014recent legislative text, the political climate (GOP priorities favoring deregulation and fossil fuel expansion), administrative inertia, industry pushback, and historical base rates\u2014decrease the probability of a shift to mandatory requirements. While some experts acknowledge a theoretical, highly unlikely scenario where a last-minute legislative amendment could impose such a mandate as part of a political bargain, none see evidence or momentum toward this outcome in current Congressional or bureaucratic activity, news coverage, or stakeholder lobbying. The base rates for such a mid-stream tightening under a party actively scaling back the IRA are minuscule. Final probability estimates range from 1% to 4%, with all experts aligning on the view that the most likely outcome is no change: domestic content will remain a voluntary path to a bonus, not a barrier to ITC eligibility.",
