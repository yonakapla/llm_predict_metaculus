However, none supplied evidence that such shock events are presently brewing beyond isolated sector noise or elevated VIX readings. Defensive arguments for a high probability, referencing the rarity and unique triggers of major late-year reversals (only during major systemic crises), remain compelling. The probability calculus is appropriately discounted by modest tail risk, but current tape action, risk measures, and macro indicators fail to support a material increase to those tail odds. I weighed the argument that no substantive pre-shock indicators (liquidity, funding strain, or volatility breakouts) are present, and that the 13% YTD cushion is formidable barring genuinely exogenous shock. Therefore, after group review, I find little justification to meaningfully soften my high-confidence call; if anything, the prevailing dialogue supports holding or very marginally boosting the probability. However, to avoid false overconfidence and anchor slightly toward caution in respect of credible, if low, market-structure fragility voiced by the best counterarguments, I will keep my probability unchanged at 97%.",

Empirical support for a 'No' requires more than citing volatility: it needs an acute catalyst, which is currently absent. My original 90% probability balanced asset pricing fundamentals, base rates, and small but plausible tail risks. The broader consensus, especially from systematic macro, allocation, and asset pricing experts, strongly backs a probability >90%.

Arguments that over-weighted behavioral or event risk were repeatedly and compellingly challenged, both through macro data and scenario analysis. The outlier lower forecasts were consistently critiqued for overfitting seasonal caution or for failing to quantify the extraordinary nature of what a year-end reversal would actually require.

Conversely, higher forecasts (95-98%) seem a touch overconfident, possibly underweighting non-negligible, fat-tailed uncertainty in Q4.

My original forecast already reflected a high probability based on regime uncertainty, trimming slightly for election year and global risk factors.

If this momentum continues, 2025 would mark the third consecutive year of double-digit gains \u2014 a feat achieved only four times in the past 100 years: the 1920s, 1930s, 1950s, and 1990s. The 1920s ended in the 1929 crash and the Great Depression; the 1930s were marked by volatile swings, including a 69% rally followed by a 38% drop; the 1950s brought sustained growth driven by post-war stability and a rising middle class; and the 1990s saw an internet-driven boom culminating in the dot-com bubble burst.

This marks the first time since February 6 that the Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis, though it has not outperformed the S&P 500 in a full calendar year since 2020. Despite this momentum, large-cap stocks have significantly outperformed small caps over the past decade: the S&P 500 gained 259.7% since December 31, 2013, compared to the Russell 2000's 110.11%. The current small-cap rally is driven more by speculative optimism than fundamentals\u201443% of Russell 2000 companies are unprofitable, yet unprofitable stocks in the index are up 55% year to date, compared to just 8% for profitable ones. Since the market bottom on April 8, unprofitable small caps have surged 108%. This rally is fueled by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which benefit small caps due to their reliance on floating-rate debt. According to David Wagner of Aptus Capital Advisors, the gains reflect a 'rates trade' rather than improved business fundamentals. Additionally, the private equity and venture capital boom has kept high-growth companies private, reducing the number of high-quality public small caps and weakening the sector's overall quality. Despite this, some investors like Francis Gannon of Royce Investment Partners argue that high-quality small caps are increasingly serving as liquidity providers to private equity, a trend not yet recognized by the market. The S&P Small Cap 600, which screens for profitability, rose only 1.8% year to date, highlighting the divergence between quality and speculative small-cap performance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 12:10 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20251018160/small-caps-are-having-a-good-year-but-heres-why-the-sp-500-will-win-in-the-end)\n\n**Friendly Trade: Stock Market Traders Push S&P 500 to Rise by End of Friday's Session**\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.53% to close at 6,664.01 points during Friday's trading session on the NYSE, increasing the total market value of its components by 52.574 billion Euros.

The S&P 500 posted its largest weekly gain since August, supported by Trump\u2019s optimistic comments on U.S.-China trade negotiations and confirmation of an upcoming summit with President Xi Jinping. Regional bank stocks, which had declined sharply the previous day, reversed course and rose. Despite a drop in Oracle due to concerns over insufficient AI cloud demand, overall market sentiment improved. The Federal Reserve\u2019s potential for a 0.25 percentage point rate cut in October was anticipated by Morgan Stanley economists, while St. Louis Fed President Musalem suggested another rate cut could be warranted given labor market softening. However, the Fed emphasized that policy decisions would be made meeting by meeting. U.S. Treasury yields declined, with 10-year yields falling below 4%, prompting JP Morgan Chase to withdraw its short position recommendation. The dollar index posted its largest weekly drop in over two months, pressured by trade risks, credit concerns, and rate cut expectations. The yen rose to a high of 149.38 per dollar before stabilizing near previous close levels. In commodities, crude oil prices edged up slightly but ended the week down 2.3%, marking three consecutive weekly losses\u2014the longest since September. Supply overhang concerns, highlighted by the IEA increasing its forecast for 2026 supply surplus by 18%, and rising storage demand in Cushing, Oklahoma, weighed on prices. Silver plunged over 6%\u2014its worst weekly performance in six months\u2014after reaching a record high earlier in the week, as profit-taking followed a sharp rally. Gold, though down 2.2%, remained up over 60% year-to-date, supported by central bank buying and ETF inflows, with expectations of at least one major Fed rate cut in 2025 boosting its appeal. Bloomberg reported that silver\u2019s extreme shortage in London eased slightly, contributing to downward pressure. The market remains sensitive to U.S.-China trade developments, with Trump signaling that tariffs are unsustainable and that diplomatic engagement is ongoing. He also announced plans to meet with Russian President Putin within two weeks to discuss ending the Ukraine war, potentially increasing Russian oil flows. Western nations continue efforts to block Russian oil revenue, but India has signaled a reduction in purchases without a full halt. The U.S. Treasury market saw a stall in its rally as trade and credit concerns receded.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 08:40 PM\nSource:[Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2025-10-17/T4AEAQGOYMTC00)\n\n**Santoli's Friday market wrap-up: Firmer tone to end the week, as urgent regional bank selling abates**\nOn October 17, 2025, CNBC Senior Markets Commentator Mike Santoli reported that financial markets ended the week with a firmer tone as urgent selling in regional banks subsided. The S&P 500 remained range-bound within the levels from the previous Friday's 2.7% drop, which ended a prolonged period without a 1% daily decline, and has traded around the 6667 level\u2014ten times the March 2009 generational low. The index has shown a sideways pattern over the past five weeks, frequently crossing the 6667 line daily. While concerns over a China-trade agreement remain unresolved, investors question whether a 2% dip from a record high was sufficient to reduce market froth. The rally has seen orderly, rotational index gains alongside erratic surges in low-quality, speculative stocks and heightened retail options activity. In recent days, speculative sectors like quantum tech, drones, and upstart nuclear power have cooled slightly. Bitcoin, viewed as a risk appetite gauge, remains near its post-2024-election high and above its 200-day moving average, showing signs of being oversold and potentially primed for a rebound. Regional banks rebounded slightly but remain down about 2% for the week, following Thursday's sharp decline amid multiple credit concerns, though the absence of forced selling and positive signals from major bank CEOs and American Express\u2019s strong results eased investor anxiety. The broader market outlook hinges on a self-sustaining AI-driven investment boom and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts in a resilient economy. China-tariff tensions and credit instability are seen as challenges to the Fed\u2019s credibility in cutting rates for sound economic reasons rather than to rescue a weakening economy. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) closed above 24, elevated for a 2% dip, signaling market unease, though it declined as the S&P 500 rose. Gold, which had continued rising despite falling stocks, yields, the dollar, and oil\u2014suggesting risk-off or capital flight\u2014retracted over 1% on Friday, offering relief but raising concerns about a potential sharper correction given its extended position.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 08:22 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/17/santolis-friday-market-wrap-up-slightly-firmer-tone-to-end-the-week.html)\n\n**Friday Trading in New York: S&P 500 Gains Momentum**\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 rose 0.36 percent to close at 6,653.02 points by 20:00 via the NYSE, achieving a market capitalization of \u20ac52.574 billion.

Concerns over credit health in the U.S. banking sector contributed to the mixed market movement. Following revelations from regional banks Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance that they encountered fraud in some loans, investor anxiety over bank credit portfolios intensified. Regional bank stocks had sharply declined the previous day, but on this day, Zions Bancorp shares rose approximately 5% and Western Alliance shares rose 3% at the opening. Investor focus remained on developments involving China, after Beijing imposed export restrictions on rare earth elements. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on China, but later stated in a Fox Business interview that a 100% tariff would be 'not sustainable,' easing some concerns about escalating trade tensions. Trump also said his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping was 'very good' and emphasized the need for a 'fair deal' between the two nations.

By 15:55, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5% to 46,190, the S&P 500 advanced 0.2% to 6,645, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.2% to 22,604. The previous day's decline was driven by reports of significant loan write-downs at regional banks, with Zions and Western Alliance each falling 10-13%, partly due to allegations of borrower fraud. Several smaller banks were dragged down in the sell-off. However, on Friday, shares rebounded: Zions rose 5.4% after Baird upgraded its recommendation to 'outperform' from 'neutral', with the firm calling the market drop 'disproportionately large' relative to the potential credit losses. Western Alliance climbed 3.4%. Investment bank Jefferies, which had dropped 10% on Thursday, gained nearly 6%, supported by Oppenheimer's assessment that its exposure to the collapsed car manufacturer First Brands was limited. Donald Trump\u2019s comments in a Fox Business interview eased market anxiety over U.S.-China trade tensions, as he stated that 100% tariffs were not sustainable and expressed confidence that the situation would resolve. He said, 'I think it will work out with China, but we must have a fair deal. It has to be fair.' Oracle fell 5.2% after rising on Thursday on reports of a cloud computing deal with Meta. American Express rose 2.9% after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, and raising the lower end of its guidance for both profit and revenue. Eli Lilly declined 3.8% following Trump\u2019s Thursday statement that prices for weight-loss drugs could be significantly lower.

The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in lower than expected, reinforcing the view that inflation is cooling and sustaining hopes that the Federal Reserve may cut its key interest rate this year. However, market gains were limited by ongoing tariff tensions: President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, prompting retaliatory measures from Canada and Europe. These trade disputes have pressured U.S. equities, raising concerns about a potential recession in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

The market is coming off a strong session, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq setting new record closes, while the Dow finished just below its December 2024 high, with a decline of less than a quarter of a percentage point. Investors are entering a busy week, with a packed calendar including a Federal Reserve meeting, a wave of earnings from major companies, and ongoing trade talks, including those between the US and China. With a combination of macro and company-level catalysts at play, traders are looking for direction as July comes to a close. Here are five things to know before the opening bell: 1. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at all-time highs on Monday, continuing a rally that has gained momentum in recent weeks. 2. It's a busy day for earnings, with several major companies set to report before the market opens, including UnitedHealth, Boeing, UPS, and Procter & Gamble. 3. The Federal Reserve begins its two-day monetary policy meeting today, and while markets expect interest rates to remain unchanged this time, investors are still paying close attention. 4. The new trade agreement between the US and EU has taken some pressure off the commercial front, with the two parties agreeing to a 15% tariff instead of the previously threatened 30%. 5. Investors are watching key economic data, including the JOLTS report and consumer confidence numbers for July, which could change the market's sentiment, especially as operators look for clues on the health of the labor market and how consumers are feeling in the current environment.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 11:35 AM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/es/noticias/2025/07/29/los-futuros-del-dow-cotizan-mixtos-hoy-5-cosas-que-hay-que-saber-antes-de-la-apertura-de-wall-street/)\n\n**New York Stock Exchange Closes in the Green, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Set New Records**\nThe New York stock exchange closed in the green on Wednesday, July 17, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq setting new historical closing records.

PepsiCo reported a net income of $1.26 billion in the second quarter of 2025, 59% lower than the $2.08 billion earned in the same period last year. However, the earnings per share exceeded analyst expectations, leading to a 7.45% increase, the largest gain for the company in a session since March 2020. United Airlines' shares rose 3.11%, despite the company's quarterly profit decline due to operational problems at Newark Airport in New York, where it handles nearly 70% of flights. TSMC's ADR rose 3.37%, while Nvidia advanced 0.95%. According to Capital Economics, the current valuation based on artificial intelligence is being driven more by profits than valuations, similar to the dotcom bubble in the 90s.

But our perception is that this won't happen soon,' notes the consultant. 'This is one of the main reasons why we predict new gains in the US stock market until the end of next year, with the technology sector leading the way.

    "summary": "All experts assign a very high probability that the S&P 500 Index will finish 2025 above its 2024 close, given that as of mid-October 2025, the index is up over 13% year-to-date. Base rates from historical data (all calendar years, and especially years with 10%+ YTD October gains) overwhelmingly support a positive outcome: it is rare for such sizeable gains to be fully erased in the final 2.5 months absent a major systemic shock. Nearly every perspective\u2014spanning investment management, macroeconomics, political science, finance, and market sentiment\u2014sees supportive factors: expectations of Fed rate cuts, positive earnings (notably from AI/tech), seasonality, and policy stability post-election. Risks, including regional bank fragility, US-China trade tensions, valuation bubbles, and elevated volatility, are acknowledged but considered insufficient to overturn the cushion of gains unless catalyzed by an extreme, exogenous event (e.g., financial crisis, geopolitical escalation, severe policy error). The most plausible 'No' scenarios involve sharp late-year corrections brought about by such unforeseen shocks, but these are not the base case given current resilience. Probability estimates cluster tightly between 87% and 98%, with most between 90\u201397%. Experts agree the status quo is for a 'Yes' outcome, barring unprecedented tail risks manifesting rapidly before year-end.",
