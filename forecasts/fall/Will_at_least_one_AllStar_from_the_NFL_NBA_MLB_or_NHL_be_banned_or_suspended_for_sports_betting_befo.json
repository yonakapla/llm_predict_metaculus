Furthermore, no known investigations or suspicions currently implicate high-profile All-Star players in such conduct, and the news flow is utterly silent on this front despite the NFL, MLB, and NBA being in active seasons.

Even with increased scrutiny and media attention, nothing rises to the level of a confirmed, league-acknowledged suspension for an All-Star before January 1, 2026.",

This could result from league monitoring (cross-referenced betting data), increased gray area due to permissive new NCAA rules causing confusion, or a star-player's betting activity on a non-league sport/contest that nonetheless violates league-specific rules. Alternatively, a high-profile sting or investigation (possibly inspired by NCAA or European enforcement crackdowns) nets a current All-Star in a sweep.",

There is little evidence supporting an imminent shift: most star players are risk-averse, educated, and closely monitored; union CBAs offer some safeguards and due process. However, the recent NCAA move to allow betting on pro sports for athletes (pending final approval) may foster cognitive slippage in what is permitted, especially for athletes who recently turned pro and are adjusting to league rules. There is also significant social normalization, overloaded gambling marketing (as shown by the UK/US ad studies), and more aggressive data-sharing between leagues and sportsbooks\u2014which slightly raises tail risk. Still, to resolve 'Yes', the event must involve a current All-Star, and ~2.5 months is a short window when CBA due process can drag out investigations. Barring a bombshell revelation or a rushed league action, it is likelier that a previous pattern persists and suspensions remain limited to less prominent players. Nevertheless, the combination of swelling sports betting culture and expanded All-Star lists raises the probability modestly above the pure historic rate. I estimate a 15% chance that at least one All-Star (as defined) is suspended or banned for sports betting before the end of 2025.",

The base rate of suspensions in the post-PASPA US sports ecosystem is much higher than the pre-2018 era, particularly among non-elite players, and normalization of betting is compounding exposure. League-level vigilance and educational efforts are highest for All-Stars, but the risk is not zero: even a recreational bet on a non-league sport could trigger a suspension due to strict rules and intense public/media spotlight. The current short window to resolution (less than 3 months) does significantly reduce the likelihood. Still, the sheer volume of betting, increased advertising, and NCAA policy shifts (seen as reflective of a society-wide no-longer-taboo moment) continue to push boundaries and risks outward\u2014even among the most privileged athletes. Detection and monitoring are at an all-time high, and the leagues could issue a minor suspension as a public show of force if credible evidence surfaces. Despite this, the absence of any All-Star suspensions historically and strong financial deterrents temper the probability.

Alternatively, an active All-Star succumbs to temptation, places a legal (but league-prohibited) bet, and is flagged by monitoring software or a whistleblower.

Surveillance and compliance pressure is at an all-time high for the most visible athletes. Still, betting\u2019s normalization, the massive volume of ads and access, and the raw number of eligible All-Stars create a tangible 'long-tail' risk, especially as minor prop bets (not game-fixing) would still trigger a suspension. My expert view is that, barring a retroactive investigation or unexpected whistleblower, the window for a suspension is now quite small\u2014but not zero.

While increased monitoring and cultural normalization theoretically heighten risk, the time window is now very short and most All-Star events (especially NHL, plus MLB 2025, NBA 2025 already held) are complete.

Nevertheless, the historical base rate remains extremely low for star players (virtually zero), and the window is now quite short. News and enforcement trends suggest monitoring (and possibly quiet investigations) but offer no clear evidence of looming suspensions. Most offenses seem to occur among marginal players, with most All-Stars wary of risk due to high stakes and peer/institutional deterrence.

Additionally, the NCAA's shift toward tolerating some forms of betting is symptomatic of broader change, though its immediate effect is limited for current pro All-Stars.

While normalization and external exposure do elevate background risk, the evidence weighs more heavily on inertia, especially given the time constraint.

No panelist found fresh signals or rumors of ongoing All-Star-related investigations. While I slightly elevated risk for cultural normalization and NCAA spillover, the repeated emphasis on selection effects, institutional incentives, and timeline compression justifies an even slightly lower (sharper) probability.

Critiques of higher probabilities emphasize the robustness of institutional deterrence, historic base rates, and the speed at which actionable infractions come to public light for prominent careers. No credible evidence has emerged to suggest imminent risk for any current All-Star, suggesting little justification for deviation from my base rate\u2013anchored, risk-aware position.

While risks from increased normalization and NCAA rule changes are real, they do not erode elite deterrence and process inertia quickly enough to push above low double-digits. Critiques of higher (15-18%) estimates focused on the underappreciation of actual process time-lags for high-profile cases and league incentive to quietly resolve or suppress minor, ambiguous violations. Defenses of low/probabilistic estimates (7-12%) are rooted in both the status quo and the operational realities of compliance, as well as the short resolution window. No new compelling argument emerged during deliberation to suggest a meaningful increase in risk. However, given the slight spread in group estimates, and to best calibrate to a broader expert signal that pegs plausible risk in the 8-12% range, I will make a minimal upward adjustment to 8%.",

Some sociological and deviance-based perspectives leaned slightly higher based on normalization, but even these did not present compelling evidence for a near-future infraction. The strongest shared insight is the operational and reputational inertia that shields All-Stars\u2014coupled with a firm lack of investigatory signals in the news flow. Therefore, I see no reason to revise upward and, if anything, the discussion gives me slightly more confidence that my initial estimate is well-calibrated. I will maintain my forecast at 12%.",

Across domains (law, management, sociology), base-rate anchoring is very strong: no All-Star has yet been suspended, and historical process lags (league and CBA due process, institutional risk aversion) further suppress the odds as the window closes. Most forecasters landed near or modestly below my initial probability, emphasizing the critical importance of (1) the lack of any news, leaks, or rumors involving All-Stars, and (2) the procedural delays that tend to elongate investigation-to-suspension timelines, especially for high-profile cases. Some slightly lower forecasts (7\u201315%) anchor more tightly to base rates, highlighting that normalization in a macro sense does not quickly or reliably break through at the elite level\u2014especially not on a timeline of under three months. However, there is still a clear acknowledgment in the group of slightly elevated risk compared to pre-legalization, due to normalization, NCAA changes, and increased ad exposure. After weighing all this, I find the best-calibrated probability is marginally below my Phase I figure, specifically as I may have overweighted environmental cues versus base rates and resolution latency.

Several noted the total lack of leaks, investigative 'smoke,' or news about All-Stars\u2014historically a reliable precursor even for less-prominent suspensions. Furthermore, the NCAA policy liberalization is unlikely to directly confuse or impact seasoned All-Stars in the short term. Considering these points, I recognize my initial estimate gave too much weight to increased normalization and detection risk, and not quite enough to historical inertia, practical process timing, and the informational void regarding any current All-Star probes. I am lowering my probability to 12%, which remains moderately above the pure base rate (reflecting real, if remote, tail risk from surging normalization and surveillance) but acknowledges the very strong arguments for a low incidence over this short horizon.",

The absence of any leaks or rumors and a consistent pattern of pre-warning before past suspensions (even for lesser players) strengthens this point. While my sociological/subcultural analysis justifies slightly elevated tail risk due to normalization and the influx of new/vulnerable All-Stars, the procedural and base rate arguments merit a modest reduction.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nEach of the four major professional sports in the US runs its own version of an All-Star game or tournament every year:\n\n* In the NFL this is called [Pro Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl). For most of the preceedin years this matched the top players in the American Football Conference (AFC) against those in the National Football Conference (NFC). However, as of December 2024 it features a series of skill competitions, such as passing challenges and precision drills, as well as a flag football game between the NFC and AFC rosters instead of a traditional full-contact game.\n* In the NBA, [it used to feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game#Rosters_selection) a game between two 12-player squads picked from each of the two conferences. This was also changed in December 2024, with the [new format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NBA_All-Star_Game) splitting the 24 players into three teams of 8 that will compete in a tournament with the winners of the Rising Stars challenge.\n* In MLB, [this is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game) a a traditional matchup between the American League and National League. Starters are chosen through fan voting, while pitchers and reserves are selected by a combination of player votes and selections by the Commissioner's Office. Each MLB team is guaranteed at least one representative.\n* In NHL, [the format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game#Formats) has changed multiple times, going from a game between two teams each selected from one of the conferences, to a single elimination tournament between four teams, representing the league's four divisions. The NHL decided to not run an All-Star game in 2025 and instead hold a new Four Nations Face-Off tournament as a preview for the league's return to Olympic participation in 2026.\n\nIn 2018, sports betting was broadly legalized in the US with the overturning of the [Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992) by the Supreme Court. Since then gambling-related suspensions and bans [have](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/24/sport/nfl-gambling-suspension-eyioma-uwazurike-spt-intl/index.html) [dramatically](https://frontofficesports.com/nbas-lifetime-ban-highlights-surge-in-gambling-related-incidents/) [increased](https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-announces-sports-betting-violation-suspensions) across sports.

Both teams revealed their 32-player rosters today. The Lions selected three foreign pitchers: Fly-Lion, Lion Difin, and Mondes. The Monkeys finalized their roster with Wei Nengdi, Moshenle, and Bosailuo. The series follows a best-of-four format, with the first-half champion Lions guaranteed at least one win.

The Lions dropped rookie pitcher Oderui, who had only pitched twice against the Monkeys with a 6.84 ERA since joining in late August. The Monkeys opted to include Bosailuo, who made 15 appearances in the majors with a 3.89 ERA, over rookie left-hander Kale, who joined late and had no prior matchup against the Lions.

Across the opening weekend of the 2025\u201326 season, researchers recorded over 27,000 gambling messages across live matches, sports news, and social media, with 91% visible during live play. Over 13,000 gambling ads were shown during the restricted period, indicating the ban\u2019s failure. The report notes that more than 60% of promotions appeared during the supposed blackout window, undermining the policy\u2019s intent. Lead researcher Dr. Raffaello Rossi stated that self-regulation has clearly failed. The study also found that 8.6% of televised gambling ads came from unlicensed operators, and only 12% included harm reduction messages\u2014well below the industry\u2019s 20% target. The upcoming 2026 front-of-shirt sponsorship ban is expected to have minimal impact, as shirt ads account for less than 10% of total gambling exposure. Researchers are calling for a full, enforceable whistle-to-whistle ban across all platforms, mandatory harm reduction messaging, and stricter controls on unlicensed or misleading sponsorships. The findings align with global trends: while sportsbook advertising in the NFL declined by nearly 8% in the 2024\u20132025 season, NBA ads rose 23% and MLB impressions increased 12%. In the NHL Stanley Cup Finals, fans saw nearly 6,000 gambling messages\u2014far exceeding the 369 during the NBA Finals. Joe Maloney of the American Gaming Association argued that regulated operators' ads make up a 'low single-digit percentage' and are essential to legal sports betting, helping reduce illegal gambling. The study concludes that comprehensive legislation is needed to address the persistent saturation of gambling marketing in sports.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[ReadWrite](https://readwrite.com/5000-gambling-ads-premier-league-match-despite-ban-study/)\n\n**NCAA Approves Major Rule Change To Allow College Athletes To Bet On (Some) Sports**\nThe NCAA has approved a major rule change allowing student-athletes to bet on professional sports, pending final approval from Division II and Division III leadership. This shift comes after seven years since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2018 decision that legalized sports betting in most states, with over 75% now permitting the practice. The NCAA has previously faced scandals involving student-athletes, including investigations into men's basketball players for point shaving and football players from Iowa and Iowa State in a 2023 sting operation, many of which involved gambling on games they participated in.

LHJMQ Commissioner Mario Cecchini acknowledged that the league aims to encourage more NHL recruiters to attend games in Quebec, stating, 'On aimerait que certains recruteurs viennent plus souvent chez nous,' and described the event as 'une occasion de venir.' The 40 players selected for the game were chosen based on requests from NHL teams, indicating which prospects they wish to evaluate. Among the most anticipated players are defenseman Xavier Villeneuve of the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada and Russian forward Egor Shilov of the Victoriaville Tigres; Lars Steiner of the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies is absent due to injury. The Quebec Remparts and Saint-Jean Sea Dogs are the most represented teams, each with six players. Cecchini, who became commissioner in May 2023, noted that despite the LHJMQ\u2019s historic success\u2014winning the Memorial Cup and a strong draft performance\u2014the league recorded its worst draft results in history, with only 12 players selected in the 2024 NHL Entry Draft. He emphasized that the decline in NHL scout attendance is not due to bias against the league, citing logistical challenges such as distance, as Ontario is only two hours away while Quebec and Western Canada are more geographically dispersed. He stated, 'Je ne sens pas qu'il y a un biais contre notre ligue,' and confirmed ongoing dialogue with NHL executives to understand recruitment patterns.

Both teams revealed their 32-player rosters today. The Lions selected three foreign pitchers: Fly-Lion, Lion Difin, and Mondes. The Monkeys finalized their roster with Wei Nengdi, Moshenle, and Bosailuo. The series follows a best-of-four format, with the first-half champion Lions guaranteed at least one win. The winner will advance to the Taiwan Series, where they will face the already-qualified CTBC Brothers to compete for the 2025 CPBL championship. The Lions dropped rookie pitcher Oderui, who had only pitched twice against the Monkeys with a 6.84 ERA since joining in late August. The Monkeys opted to include Bosailuo, who made 15 appearances in the majors with a 3.89 ERA, over rookie left-hander Kale, who joined late and had no prior matchup against the Lions.

Notre Dame head football coach Marcus Freeman expressed concern over these disruptions during the spring, but the new unified window is expected to eliminate such issues, with a final decision expected on October 8, 2025. The second proposed change involves allowing college athletes and coaches to bet on professional sports, including the NFL, MLB, and NHL, marking a significant relaxation of current gambling restrictions.

The change, announced by the Division I Administrative Committee on October 8, 2025, requires approval from Divisions II and III to take effect. While betting on college sports remains prohibited, the move aims to align NCAA policies with those of campus peers and allow institutions to focus on protecting the integrity of college athletics. The decision has sparked strong reactions from fans, with many expressing outrage on social media, citing concerns about corruption, the integrity of sports, and the potential for pre-determined outcomes. Critics argue that allowing betting could undermine college sports, especially after high-profile incidents such as Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer\u2019s 2022 Venmo transactions referencing 'sports gambling'\u2014which he claimed were inside jokes\u2014and the suspension of Pennsylvania high school soccer coach David Zimmerman for placing prop bets with students.

Across the opening weekend of the 2025\u201326 season, researchers recorded over 27,000 gambling messages across live matches, sports news, and social media, with 91% visible during live play. Over 13,000 gambling ads were shown during the restricted period, indicating the ban\u2019s failure. The report notes that more than 60% of promotions appeared during the supposed blackout window, undermining the policy\u2019s intent. Lead researcher Dr. Raffaello Rossi stated that self-regulation has clearly failed. The study also found that 8.6% of televised gambling ads came from unlicensed operators, and only 12% included harm reduction messages\u2014well below the industry\u2019s 20% target. The upcoming 2026 front-of-shirt sponsorship ban is expected to have minimal impact, as shirt ads account for less than 10% of total gambling exposure. Researchers are calling for a full, enforceable whistle-to-whistle ban across all platforms, mandatory harm reduction messaging, and stricter controls on unlicensed or misleading sponsorships. The findings align with global trends: while sportsbook advertising in the NFL declined by nearly 8% in the 2024\u20132025 season, NBA ads rose 23% and MLB impressions increased 12%. In the NHL Stanley Cup Finals, fans saw nearly 6,000 gambling messages\u2014far exceeding the 369 during the NBA Finals. Joe Maloney of the American Gaming Association argued that regulated operators' ads make up a 'low single-digit percentage' and are essential to legal sports betting, helping reduce illegal gambling.

The change, which requires approval from Division II and Division III to take effect, will go into force on November 1, 2025. According to Illinois athletic director and committee chairman Josh Whitman, the rule change enables the NCAA, conferences, and member schools to focus on protecting the integrity of college games while promoting healthy betting habits among student-athletes. The proposal, initiated after the Division I Board of Directors directed rule changes, does not lift the longstanding ban on betting on college games. The NCAA continues to prohibit athletes, coaches, and staff from sharing insider information with bettors and bans gambling-related advertising at championship events like March Madness. The move follows a surge in NCAA investigations into gambling violations, including the permanent suspension of three Division I basketball players for betting on their own games and the ongoing investigation of 13 players from six men\u2019s basketball programs. Thirty-eight U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico now have legal sports gambling, with age limits ranging from 18 to 21. The NCAA collaborates with monitoring companies to detect improper betting and has intensified educational efforts to inform athletes about gambling risks.

It criticises commissioner Adam Silver for being \"too player\u2011friendly\" and for experimenting with formats that have not improved the weekend. The piece notes that the Slam Dunk Contest has relied on rookies and G\u2011League players, the 3\u2011point Contest has struggled to attract star shooters, and the Skills Contest was marred by a \"cheap win\" from Victor Wembanyama and Chris Paul. It describes the All\u2011Star Game itself as \"lazy\" and \"uncontested\", and says Silver has tried various formats, including East\u2011vs\u2011West and a four\u2011team tournament chosen by Inside the NBA. The article reports that the 2026 All\u2011Star Game will use a three\u2011team round\u2011robin with two American teams and one international squad, a change that the author doubts will succeed. The author compares the NBA to other sports, noting that hockey and baseball have found success while the NFL\u2019s Pro Bowl is \"dead\". The piece concludes that to revive the weekend, the NBA must improve the preliminary events, such as making the Slam Dunk Contest a $5\u202fmillion prize and featuring high\u2011profile matchups like Sabrina\u202fIonescu vs. Steph\u202fCurry, and possibly adding a 1\u2011on\u20111 tournament.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 05:24 PM\nSource:[FanSided](https://fansided.com/nba/nba-announces-innovative-new-plan-ruin-all-star-game)\n\n**Report: NBA to have 2 U.S. teams, 1 World team in All-Star Game**\nThe NBA is planning a new All\u2011Star Game format for 2026 that will feature two U.S. teams and one international team competing in a round\u2011robin tournament with 12\u2011minute quarters, according to ESPN. The event will move from a Sunday night slot to Sunday afternoon and will be held on Feb.\u202f15 at the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 home arena in Inglewood, California, with NBC as the new television partner. The change follows the 2025 format\u2014a mini\u2011tournament that was widely criticized\u2014where three All\u2011Star teams were drafted by captains and a fourth team was the winner of the Rising Stars Challenge; the games were played to a target score of 40 points instead of a game clock, and television ratings for the Feb.\u202f16 event in San Francisco fell 13\u202fpercent. NBA commissioner Adam Silver commented, 'I thought we made almost an immeasurable amount of progress. I thought this was a little better, but it was a miss. We're not there in terms of creating an All\u2011Star experience that we can be proud of, that our players can be proud of.'

According to reports from The Athletic and AP, the structure will feature three teams of eight players each: two American squads (Team USA\u202f1 and Team USA\u202f2) and one international squad (Team World). The matchups will be short, round\u2011robin games to determine a winner, with a total of 16 American All\u2011Stars and eight international stars\u2014roughly mirroring the league\u2019s current player composition of about 70\u202f% U.S. and 30\u202f% overseas. The proposal has already received positive feedback from the NBA\u2019s competition committee, and Commissioner Adam Silver has acknowledged that a straight U.S. vs. World game would be difficult to balance because of the numerical disparity between American and international players.\n\nThe change comes after the 2024 All\u2011Star Game ended in a 211\u2011186 no\u2011defense shootout that was widely criticized for its lack of competitiveness. In 2025, the NBA experimented with a four\u2011team, untimed tournament format that also failed to resonate with players and fans.

Silver noted that the game would coincide with NBC\u2019s coverage of the Milan\u2011Cortina Winter Olympics and that moving the game to a Sunday afternoon tip\u2011off would allow Olympic broadcasts before and after the game (quote: 'I think all of those factors, when they come together, it presents an enormous opportunity for us to do something with an international competition instead of the traditional All\u2011Star formats that we've used'). The proposed format follows the NHL\u2019s 4 Nations Face\u2011Off, which replaced its All\u2011Star Game with an international mini\u2011tournament that drew record viewership (source: article). Roughly 25\u202f% of current NBA players were born outside the U.S., and for eight consecutive seasons the MVP has been awarded to a non\u2011U.S. player, with at least ten international players selected in every draft since 2010 (source: article). The NBA has previously experimented with All\u2011Star formats, such as the four\u2011team tournament last season, which was criticised for gimmicks and long stoppages and was the second\u2011lowest\u2011rated All\u2011Star Game, with viewership down 13\u202f% from the 2024 game (source: article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 12:39 AM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6596517/2025/09/03/nba-all-star-game-new-format-2026/)\n\n**NBA solves major problem for USA vs. the World**\nLast year\u2019s NBA All\u2011Star Game was criticized for being non\u2011competitive, partly due to distractions such as a Mr. Beast shooting contest and an extended tribute to 'Inside the NBA' (the article notes these distractions). The NHL, meanwhile, ran a successful '4 Nations Face\u2011Off', replacing its All\u2011Star Game (the article says the NHL sponsored a round\u2011robin tournament featuring teams from the USA, Canada, Finland and Norway, with Canada defeating the USA 3\u20112 in overtime). The NBA\u2019s current proposal is to replace the traditional 'USA vs. World' format with a round\u2011robin tournament featuring three eight\u2011player teams, only one of which is all\u2011international (the article states: 'Three eight\u2011player teams will compete, with only one of them being full of international players'). Last year\u2019s format had teams drafted by Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith, essentially split into an international team, a team of older legends and a team of younger All\u2011Stars (the article describes Team Chuck, Team Shaq and Team Kenny). Only seven of the 26 All\u2011Stars were international, and the last seven NBA MVPs were born outside the United States (the article gives these numbers). The NBA\u2019s new format removes a fourth team, potentially excluding 'G\u2011League' players, but it may not increase competitiveness (the article says: 'there's no guarantee the games will be more competitive'). Players\u2019 focus on playoff health also undermines the event; James withdrew from the 2025 game early and sat out the second half in 2023 (the article mentions this). The article concludes that the change is another attempt to tweak 'All\u2011Star Weekend', with Silver pushing a proposal to save the weekend (the article states: 'Don't be surprised if this time next year, Silver is advancing yet another proposal to save All\u2011Star Weekend').\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 12:17 AM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_solves_major_problem_for_usa_vs_the_world/s1_13132_42683614)\n\n**WAMC Sports Report 6/27/25: Judge, Ohtani elected to start in All-Star Game as top vote-getters**\nAaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani have been elected as starters for the July 15 All-Star Game at Atlanta's Truist Park, receiving the most votes from fans. Judge led the major leagues with 4,012,983 votes, while Ohtani topped the NL and was second in the big leagues with 3,967,668 votes. Griffin Canning, a right-hander for the New York Mets, left Thursday night's game against Atlanta in the third inning due to a left ankle injury, which 'looks like an Achilles,' according to manager Carlos Mendoza. The Houston Astros secured a 2-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies, thanks to Cam Smith's RBI single in the eighth inning. The Boston Red Sox were off Thursday and will host the Toronto Blue Jays tonight at 7:10. Suspended Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco has been found guilty of sexually abusing a child and received a two-year suspended sentence. Barry Bonds will be getting a statue outside the San Francisco Giants' home stadium, where he set baseball's career home run record. The NBA draft resumed with a trade, and the Phoenix Suns took Rasheer Fleming at No. 31. The NFL has suspended former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker for the first 10 weeks next season for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The NHL and NHL Players' Association are close to an agreement on a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement. Kevin Roy and Aldrich Potgieter each shot 10-under 62 to break the Rocket Classic record and share the first-round lead. The NCAA is considering a proposal to allow athletes and staff to bet on professional sports while maintaining strict bans on college sports betting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 27, 2025 10:12 AM\nSource:[WAMC/Northeast Public Radio](https://www.wamc.org/news/2025-06-27/wamc-sports-report-6-27-25-judge-ohtani-elected-to-start-in-all-star-game-as-top-vote-getters)\n\n**Judge, Ohtani Named 2025 MLB All-Stars as AL, NL Finalists Announced in Voting Update**\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) has announced the finalists for the 2025 All-Star Game.

    "summary": "All experts agree that while sports-betting-related suspensions have increased across the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL since the 2018 legalization of sports betting in the US, there have been no cases to date of an active All-Star being banned or suspended for such violations. The base rate for these events remains at or near zero for All-Stars, even amidst multiple cases involving non-star or fringe players. Key factors raising the probability in the coming months include: the accelerating normalization and saturation of sports betting (ubiquitous ads and partnerships with gambling brands), increased surveillance and detection technology by leagues, recent NCAA rule changes loosening betting for college athletes, and continued enforcement crackdowns. However, these are offset by the unique deterrence for All-Stars, who have higher financial, reputational, and professional stakes, more robust compliance education and support, and heavier league and media scrutiny. The experts highlight the very short time left before the question closes\u2014less than three months\u2014along with a total absence of current news, rumors, or investigations involving high-profile All-Stars, as a significant dampener on the odds. Several note the slightly increasing risk due to a larger pool of eligible All-Stars and a nonzero \"tail risk\" from the volume of exposure and betting normalization, but overall view the event as unlikely in the short window. Probabilities offered cluster between 7% and 18%, with most in the 8%\u201318% range, and consensus that the risk is notably above historic rates but still well below even odds for a first high-profile All-Star betting-related suspension in the remainder of 2025.",
