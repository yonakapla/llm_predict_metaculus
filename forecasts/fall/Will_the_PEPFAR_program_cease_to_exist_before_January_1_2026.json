The Trump administration has clearly attempted to dismantle much of the PEPFAR apparatus via executive orders, transferring authority, blocking funds, and reorienting strategy. However, the fine print and resolution criteria set a notably high threshold: PEPFAR must cease to exist as a distinct entity by legislative or successfully sustained executive action. Critical court rulings have, at times, blocked the most aggressive funding freezes, and even the administration\u2019s rescission efforts have been only partially successful. A significant amount of activity, including implementation levels, layoffs, and non-renewal of contracts, does not equal full statutory termination, which generally requires Congressional action\u2014the most likely path, and one not taken so far. The fact that Congress has thus far only allowed partial rescissions and protected core PEPFAR appropriations in CRs further reduces the odds of a complete legal end to the program by January 1, 2026. With just weeks before the expiry deadline and no clear sign of immediate passage of a repeal or a court-resistant order taking effect for the required 60 days, the program\u2019s formal statutory existence is overwhelmingly likely to persist, even if in hollowed-out form.",

However, from a US appropriations/legal process standpoint, most evidence suggests that PEPFAR has not yet been legally terminated, subsumed, or had funding fully zeroed out: (1) FY25 continuing resolution appropriated funds remain on the books (some have been spent, the rest are blocked/not obligated, but not all rescinded), (2) Administrative actions have been extensive but still allow enough of PEPFAR's core mission, name, and minimal functions to persist under congressional mandate, (3) Judicial battles persist but so far have not resulted in court-validated executive authority to erase the program, and (4) There is very little time (just over 5 weeks) for a legally qualifying, uninterrupted, and court-unblocked dissolution/absorption to persist for the required 60 days before Jan 1, 2026. The base rate for outright legislative program elimination or organizational absorption this close to a hard deadline, with funds appropriated by a divided government, is historically very low, even under substantial executive hostility. While the risk is real and the functional future of PEPFAR is grim, the technical criteria almost certainly won't be met for a 'Yes' before the resolution date. I therefore judge the probability as low, but not zero, given the extraordinary executive hostility and willingness to test legal boundaries.

Court interventions have blocked the most aggressive elimination tactics; while significant executive attempts to circumvent appropriations persist, and much of the program is a 'shell,' this does not meet the fine print requirement (no public funding remaining, or full programmatic/legal termination or merger for 60 uninterrupted days). With only one month left, the probability of Congress or the courts enabling the final dissolution process before January 1, 2026, is modest but not negligible.

Given the resolution criteria, the finer points of agency inactivation, rebranding, and absorption matter: so long as the core mission and the program exist in legal and budgetary terms, even as a shadow, the question resolves as No. The base rate of legal extinction for flagship aid programs is very low, especially within one year of high-profile controversy. However, the risk is not zero\u2014there is significant legal ambiguity, and the chaos of Trump-era executive action is unprecedented. I weight historical precedent and recent factual reporting to conclude the most likely outcome by Jan 1, 2026 is that PEPFAR, although a shell of its former self and likely irreparably damaged, is not technically and formally ceased in the sense required here.",

Court challenges have, so far, failed to compel restoration; the Supreme Court has issued stays favorable to the Executive, and Congress has not overridden or plainly reasserted support for full funding or independent program existence. The sharp reduction in funding released (less than half of what was appropriated), putative rescissions, and reporting that PEPFAR is functionally canceled for most countries all suggest that the program, as a distinct entity, will not survive through the resolution period (especially given the fine print that agency elimination or merger counts, barring rapid court intervention). The base rate for total program termination is low in US history; however, the unprecedented administrative and legal posture here sets this apart. The only major uncertainty is whether an emergency court order or congressional action in December could somehow reverse the situation, but with barely five weeks left, the probability of either delivering a practical restoration of the status quo ante within the 60-day lookback period is quite slim, especially with ongoing holidays and D.C. gridlock.

Nonetheless, full and actual 'existential' program elimination, per resolution criteria, requires either signed new legislation or an executive order terminating PEPFAR that survives untouchable for 60 days. As of late November 2025, PEPFAR is existentially crippled but not fully extinct: some legal shell persists, some funds are 'unassigned but not cancelled,' and litigation is unresolved. It appears clear that the Trump administration intends to ultimately end or radically reshape PEPFAR, but the process is legally and bureaucratically messy, and (per fine print) as long as the 'core mission' and program identity remain, the program is not considered dead. In the final 36 days before the deadline, absent a sudden finalizing action that is not pursued or not allowed to take effect for 60 consecutive days, the most probable scenario is that PEPFAR, though a shell, continues to exist in some nominal form on January 1, 2026. Thus, although risk is very elevated (higher than in almost any other period in program history), I judge the probability of extinction just before the deadline at below 25%. The base rate for congressional or executive program extinction before a hard deadline absent explicit legal or budgetary action is low, though the current scenario is a textbook PET-identified near-miss.

Instead, grants are blocked or slow-rolled; State/OMB are obstructing day-to-day operations, but core legal existence, branding, and some functional capacity remain, mainly via minimal life-saving exemptions and unspent appropriations. The proposed FY2026 budget and reorganization plans could change this, but with just over a month to go and given the slow pace of government action and the persistent court battles, it is unlikely this will meet the resolution criteria before January 1, 2026. The base rate for outright abolishing such a major program, within a year of strong bipartisan history and in the face of intense global/diplomatic pressure, is near zero.

The absorption of USAID programs into a reorganized State Department directorate and the severe reduction of field implementation mean that PEPFAR\u2019s distinct identity is under both legal and functional threat. However, Congress has not formally eliminated PEPFAR through law and has maintained appropriations, albeit without the executive branch releasing full funds. Courts have prevented the most extreme executive actions but left ample room for slow attrition and bureaucratic consolidation. By the fine print\u2019s letter, unless there is either (1) a law eliminating PEPFAR, (2) 60 consecutive days where it ceases as a distinct entity (by consolidation or total unfunding), or (3) elimination of all public funding, the strictest 'yes' standard may not yet be met. The field presence is close to zero in some countries, but some degree of 'bridge' services and State Department management persist. Barring an immediate additional executive consolidation or funding move that survives legal challenge and extends 60 days prior to Jan 1, there is a strong chance that PEPFAR limps on technically as a distinct program until the deadline, even if as a hollow or severely diminished shell. I thus estimate a high, but not fully extreme, probability that PEPFAR ceases to exist under the resolution criteria before Jan 1, 2026, reflecting the plausibility of both rapid elimination/consolidation in the next 5 weeks and a residual, technical survival.",

The Trump administration's repeated success in bypassing Congress (\u2018pocket rescission\u2019), combined with congressional inaction and Supreme Court greenlight, point to a real risk of formal extinction\u2014especially if courts do not step in with a durable stay. The transfer of authority, rebranding, and function absorption into a new GHSD bureau, as well as the fact that over 80% of programs and staff are gone, move this question far from the historical base rate where political pressure would restore the status quo. Given only weeks remain to Jan 1, and absent new Congressional action or a major new judicial block, the risk that PEPFAR is absorbed, structurally eliminated, or exists only as a name attached to trivial residual funding (which would likely count as 'ceased to exist' under the question criteria) is very high. The only substantial uncertainty is (a) if some technical legal loophole or minimal office branded 'PEPFAR' survives, and (b) if the courts intervene in the remaining days. Nonetheless, for Metaculus purposes and given recent events, the odds that PEPFAR is judged to have ceased to exist as a distinct program before January 2026 are overwhelming.",

Courts and Congress are slow-moving and, for all the executive bluster and genuine humanitarian disaster, have left enough of a PEPFAR shell\u2014brand, legal authorizations, some administrative action, or minimally waived services\u2014to keep it technically alive. My critique of these higher odds still stands: operational devastation is not program death in US public health bureaucracy.

The historical inertia of legacy US federal programs, even those decimated and absorbed, has proven remarkably persistent. My initial probability acknowledged above-random risk due to ongoing legal ambiguities and the administration's hostile posture, but the deliberation revealed I may have slightly over-weighted the near-term likelihood of a fully qualifying executive or legislative kill within the shrinking time window. With less than five weeks left and no decisive event yet executed (and unlikely given the holidays, court schedule, and legislative inertia), the technical odds of resolution as 'Yes' by Jan 1, 2026, fall closer to the 10-20% range advocated by much of the field.

Despite near-total field devastation and absorption of USAID functions, appropriated funds still exist, no law terminates PEPFAR, and the courts have muddled, rather than definitively enabled, a 60-day formal extinction process. The persistent pattern in US federal bureaucracy is for hollowed programs to outlive acute political hostility, sometimes for years, and participants consistently point out that even a shell or bridge activity, minimal as it is, precludes a 'Yes' unless legal and funding extinction are cleanly demonstrated. The root error in my initial 70% estimate was conflating extraordinary substantive collapse with formal legal/program death.

Notably, there is broad consensus among forecasters expert in federal appropriations, congressional process, public health systems, and aid management that catastrophic operational collapse remains distinct from formal program extinction under the Metaculus/official resolution. Although several forecasters (notably those steeped in African government relations or political science) rate the substantive elimination as nearly certain, they consistently conflate field death with statutory or de jure mortality\u2014something explicitly rebutted in both my reasoning and by multiple engaged forecasters. There is no evidence in the news or deliberation that a conclusive, uncontested legal, congressional, or 60-day presidential action (not stayed by a court) has occurred, or is almost certain to occur before the deadline. Even more, the pattern of DC bureaucracy indicates that hollowed-out programs like PEPFAR routinely persist on paper long after operational irrelevancy, and the current legal and budget environment, while hostile, shows no clear impending death warrant. The margin for sudden final action before Jan 1, 2026, is too small, and the courts and Congress still inject enough ambiguity or inertia.

Multiple strong forecasters from US appropriations and aid management fields persuasively argued that, absent explicit statutory elimination, zero funding, or 60-day court-unblocked administrative absorption (with no legal ambiguity), the bureaucratic shell of PEPFAR is likely to persist at least through January 1, 2026\u2014even in zombie form. The recurring point is that DC bureaucracy is slow to kill programs outright, especially with divided government and ongoing legal ambiguity. Past program deaths have taken longer or faced multiple cycles of partial dissolution before technical extinction. Given only 5 weeks left, and without clear evidence of a formal, court-surviving, or legislative extinction already underway, my earlier probability overestimated the odds that we\u2019d cross the high legal/administrative bar before the deadline. The humanitarian and operational collapse is irrelevant to Metaculus's strict YES criteria.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nPEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) is a global health program provided by the United States government that specifically targets HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment [outside of](https://www.state.gov/where-we-work-pepfar) the US. Since Fiscal Year (FY) 2004, the program, which is run [under the auspices of](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/) the US State Department, [has spent](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/) a total of \\$120 billion and has grown from \\$1.9 billion in its inaugural year to \\$6.5 billion in FY 2024 and [reports](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11583809/) saving over 25 million lives.&#x20;\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/) an executive order pausing for 90 days new foreign aid disbursements [including for the PEPFAR program](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-status-of-president-trumps-pause-of-foreign-aid-and-implications-for-pepfar-and-other-global-health-programs/), pending a review of all foreign assistance programs. On February 13, 2025, federal judge Amir Ali [ordered](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/judge-orders-trump-administration-reinstate-foreign-aid-funding-now-rcna192168) the Trump Administration to resume foreign aid programs in place before Trump's inauguration. On February 20, 2025, Judge Ali [ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-not-complying-foreign-aid-amir-ali-rcna193092) that the Trump Administration was not fully in compliance with the order.\n\nAfter a long bipartisan consensus about the program's usefulness, in recent years PEPFAR has faced [increased opposition](https://rollcall.com/2023/09/21/pepfar-reauthorization-debate-highlights-splits-in-gop/) in the US Congress, particularly from members of the Republican Party. In 2024 PEPFAR [received](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/pepfars-short-term-reauthorization-sets-an-uncertain-course-for-its-long-term-future/) temporary reauthorization from Congress amid the increasing opposition. See for example [this report](https://www.heritage.org/budget-and-spending/report/reassessing-americas-30-billion-global-aids-relief-program) from the Heritage Foundation.&#x20;\n\nAccording to the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-outlook-for-pepfar-in-2025-and-beyond/), the following are the most important factors to watch when assessing the future of PEPFAR:\n\n1. Concerns among anti-abortion members of Congress that PEPFAR has funded abortions in countries such as Mozambique, which has fueled speculation that PEPFAR may not have funding reauthorization and/or potentially could face budget cuts.\n2. Strong opposition to PEPFAR from the Trump Administration, including the loss of thousands of aid worker jobs since Trump's inauguration.\n3. The potential dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was implementing many of PEPFAR's programs.&#x20;\n4. Revival of the Mexico City policy by the Trump Administration, which requires no direct or indirect funding of abortions by non-governmental organizations and [includes PEPFAR](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-mexico-city-policy-an-explainer/) in its new policy.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":35481,\"question_id\":34948}}`",

The report states that persistent funding shortfalls have pushed the global HIV response into 'crisis mode,' particularly after the United States\u2014accounting for 75% of international HIV funding\u2014temporarily halted all HIV-related funding earlier in 2025. Although some programs have resumed through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), overall funding continues to decline. As of October 2025, an estimated 2.5 million people lost access to PrEP, a key HIV prevention medication. In Nigeria, male condom distribution dropped by 55% from December 2024 to March 2025. A survey by the ATHENA Network and UNAIDS found that nearly half of women and adolescent girls reported disruptions to HIV services. Despite a 54% decline in AIDS-related deaths (from 1.4 million in 2010 to 630,000 in 2024) and a 54% drop in new infections, the progress is under threat as current funding levels jeopardize the 2030 target to end AIDS as a public health threat. Currently, 40.8 million people are living with HIV, with 1.3 million new infections reported in 2024.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 01:06 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/global-funding-cuts-devastating-hiv-130653865.html)\n\n**Elon Musk's DOGE 'doesn't exist,' says Trump admin - National | Globalnews.ca**\nThe Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, appears to have ceased operations eight months before its contract was scheduled to end, according to the Office of Personnel Management director Scott Kupor, who stated that DOGE 'doesn't exist' and is no longer a 'centralized entity.' Created by executive order on January 20, 2025, the agency claimed to have cut tens of billions in federal spending during the early months of President Donald Trump's second term, with Musk asserting at his departure that the initiative felt 'like a meme coin' and questioning the absurdity of its existence. Despite its website claiming $214 billion in savings\u2014equating to $1,329 per taxpayer\u2014and a 'Wall of Receipts' displaying terminated contracts, outside financial experts could not verify these figures due to the lack of a detailed public record. By May 2025, DOGE had cut over 200,000 federal jobs, with approximately 75,000 employees accepting severance packages. Senior DOGE staff transitioned into other government roles, including Amy Gleason as adviser to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Zachary Terrell as chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Rachel Riley as chief of the Office of Naval Research. The broader Trump administration, in its first 100 days, laid off 121,000 federal workers, dismantled the Department of Education and USAID, and made major cuts to the NIH, VA, and HUD. DOGE aimed to reduce federal spending by $1 trillion, though Musk estimated $160 billion in savings at the time of his departure. White House spokeswoman Liz Huston affirmed that President Trump remains committed to reducing waste, fraud, and abuse, even as DOGE's dissolution raises questions about accountability and transparency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 08:26 PM\nSource:[Global News](https://globalnews.ca/news/11540788/doge-done-elon-musk-doesnt-exist/)\n\n**U.S. Government Efficiency Department: Media Misrepresentation Over Early Dissolution Claims**\nAccording to the Xinhua News Agency, U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Cooper denied on November 24, 2025, that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had been dissolved eight months early, calling the report by Reuters a 'clickbait headline' that misrepresented his words. Cooper clarified that while DOGE may no longer have centralized leadership, its core principles\u2014reducing bureaucracy, combating fraud and waste, reshaping federal workforce structures, and prioritizing efficiency\u2014will continue to be institutionalized through collaboration between the OPM, the White House Office of Management and Budget, and DOGE. The Department of Government Efficiency was established on January 20, 2025, when President Trump signed an executive order creating a council led by Elon Musk to cut federal spending and restore government efficiency, with a planned dissolution date of July 4, 2026. Despite claims that DOGE had already ceased to exist, Cooper emphasized that its reforms remain active. The DOGE website reported savings of approximately $160 billion by April 20, 2025, representing less than one-fifth of Musk\u2019s stated goal of $1 trillion in savings. However, federal spending has increased compared to the same period last year. Elon Musk announced his departure on May 28, 2025, with his final day being May 30, 2025, when he held a press conference with Trump. Musk, who served as a 'special government employee,' later publicly clashed with Trump over the 'Big and Beautiful' (B&F) bill. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), in a report released in late July 2025, found that DOGE caused over $21 billion in financial waste during its first six months, contradicting claims of fiscal savings.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 08:02 AM\nSource:[\u6bcf\u65e5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b0\u95fb](https://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2025-11-24/4154696.html)\n\n**US Pulls Funding From One Of Africa's Poorest Nations, ISIS Moves In**\nIn Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province, ISIS-linked violence has surged since the United States abruptly withdrew funding from USAID in January 2025 under an executive order by President Donald Trump. The withdrawal halted or significantly reduced critical programs in food security, education, HIV/AIDS care, youth employment, and government services. By October 2025, Mozambique accounted for 11% of global ISIS-linked violence, with 79% of the group\u2019s global activity recorded in Africa between January and October. On September 7, 2025, ISIS attacked Mocimboa da Praia, beheading dozens of mostly Christian men and forcing thousands to flee. The local hospital lost up to 15 staff and lacks basic medicines, while a $70,000 fishing program for youth\u2014key targets for ISIS recruiters\u2014was suspended. In Mueda, up to a dozen aid workers departed, leaving 93,000 displaced people with diminished support. The UN appeal for Cabo Delgado dropped from $352 million to $126 million, with only $73.2 million received by October, of which just $3.5 million came from the US. USAID had provided $586 million in 2024\u2014about 3% of Mozambique\u2019s GDP\u2014and over $2.4 billion in ongoing or planned projects were left in limbo. Meanwhile, despite aid cuts, the Trump administration approved a $4.7 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank to Mozambique\u2019s LNG sector to hire American contractors.

Despite its initial high visibility and mandate to radically reduce federal spending, staff, and programs, Doge's operational independence has eroded, with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Kupor confirming that the department no longer exists as a centralized entity. Responsibilities were gradually absorbed by OPM and the Office of Management and Budget, which now institutionalize Doge\u2019s structural changes. Doge\u2019s tenure was marked by controversial actions: over 200,000 federal workers were laid off, and approximately 75,000 accepted buyouts, with internal claims of $214 billion in savings\u2014figures disputed by analysts due to lack of transparency and verifiable accounting. The shutdown of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) led to severe global health consequences, with epidemiologist Brooke Nichols estimating over 600,000 excess deaths linked to the loss of malaria prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, and vaccine programs. Internal uncertainty grew after Elon Musk\u2019s 130-day contract ended on May 30, 2025, and staff reportedly packed up personal belongings from headquarters. Musk, who once held up a chainsaw at CPAC to symbolize his anti-bureaucracy mission, has since distanced himself from the operation. Former Doge officials transitioned into new roles across federal agencies\u2014Amy Gleason at HHS, Zachary Terrell as CTO at HHS, Rachel Riley at the Office of Naval Research, Jeremy Lewin at the State Department, Scott Langmack in HUD\u2019s AI initiatives, and Joe Gebbia leading the National Design Studio for federal web redesign. States like Idaho and Florida have launched their own Doge-style efficiency offices. While Doge\u2019s direct operations have ceased, its legacy persists through ongoing deregulation, AI-driven regulatory review, and visual modernization of government websites. The White House maintains that Trump continues to deliver on his mandate to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, though critics argue the initiative caused lasting harm to public services.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 05:29 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/trump-doge-shutdown-musk-what-really-happened-13953470.html)\n\n**Global funding cuts devastating HIV prevention programmes, UNAIDS says**\nUNAIDS reported on November 25, 2025, that major funding cuts have severely disrupted HIV prevention and treatment programs globally, resulting in preventable deaths among people living with HIV and cutting off access to critical prevention tools for millions.

Promoted as a revolutionary efficiency initiative aimed at eliminating $2 trillion in government waste, DOGE lasted only months\u2014far short of its intended two-year mandate. According to Scott Kupor, Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), DOGE\u2019s functions have been absorbed by traditional federal agencies. Independent analysts and a damning Senate report indicate that DOGE cost more than it saved, with only $16.3 billion in verified savings\u2014far below its initial promises. The project caused widespread institutional chaos, including the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which critics link to approximately 638,000 preventable deaths globally due to halted humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Domestically, the Department of Education was weakened, and national cybersecurity was compromised by mass layoffs of experts, exposing sensitive federal data. DOGE also granted access to AI systems to federal databases, increasing cyber vulnerabilities. Elon Musk, who left in May after a public falling out with Trump, treated government operations as a personal toy; his surreal exit event, featuring an eye injury, underscored the administration\u2019s amateurism.

Created by executive order on January 20, 2025, the agency claimed to have cut tens of billions in federal spending during the early months of President Donald Trump's second term, with Musk asserting at his departure that the initiative felt 'like a meme coin' and questioning the absurdity of its existence. Despite its website claiming $214 billion in savings\u2014equating to $1,329 per taxpayer\u2014and a 'Wall of Receipts' displaying terminated contracts, outside financial experts could not verify these figures due to the lack of a detailed public record. By May 2025, DOGE had cut over 200,000 federal jobs, with approximately 75,000 employees accepting severance packages. Senior DOGE staff transitioned into other government roles, including Amy Gleason as adviser to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Zachary Terrell as chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Rachel Riley as chief of the Office of Naval Research. The broader Trump administration, in its first 100 days, laid off 121,000 federal workers, dismantled the Department of Education and USAID, and made major cuts to the NIH, VA, and HUD. DOGE aimed to reduce federal spending by $1 trillion, though Musk estimated $160 billion in savings at the time of his departure. White House spokeswoman Liz Huston affirmed that President Trump remains committed to reducing waste, fraud, and abuse, even as DOGE's dissolution raises questions about accountability and transparency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 08:26 PM\nSource:[Global News](https://globalnews.ca/news/11540788/doge-done-elon-musk-doesnt-exist/)\n\n**U.S. News: 'DOGE' Still Exists Despite Dissolution Reports**\nOn November 23, 2025, Reuters reported exclusively that the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had been dissolved eight months early. However, Scott Cooper, the head of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and current leader of DOGE, denied the report, stating that DOGE had merely ceased having a 'centralized leadership' structure. On the same day, Cooper had previously claimed DOGE 'no longer exists' and that its functions had been absorbed by the Office of Personnel Management, which is seen as evidence of its dissolution. The DOGE was established on January 20, 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a 18-month advisory committee led by billionaire Elon Musk, with the goal of drastically cutting federal spending and restoring government efficiency. The committee was originally scheduled to end on July 4, 2026. After Musk's appointment, DOGE initiated large-scale federal employee layoffs and budget cuts, drawing widespread criticism. On May 28, 2025, Musk announced his departure from DOGE, leading to a public rift with Trump over the 'Big and Beautiful' (B&B) bill. Their relationship has since partially reconciled. In late July 2025, a report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led by Democratic members, concluded that DOGE had not achieved cost savings in six months and instead caused over $21 billion in fiscal 'waste'.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 04:49 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5605657313_14e1f8ae101901cdyk.html)\n\n**CNN: Trump Prepares New Proposal to Address Healthcare Cost Crisis**\nPresident Donald Trump is planning to unveil a new proposal to address the healthcare affordability crisis on Monday, November 24, 2025, according to three sources familiar with the matter, as his administration seeks to prevent a sharp increase in insurance premiums following the expiration of key subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The plan aims to fulfill Trump\u2019s pledge to provide a better alternative to the enhanced ACA subsidies, which currently support approximately 22 million people. This comes after Democrats rejected efforts to reopen the government, which had been shut down for over a month, demanding a clear extension of these payments. Republican senators approved a mid-December vote to extend the enhanced subsidies until the end of the year, in exchange for extending government funding through January, prompting Trump and his team to develop their competing proposal. The enhanced subsidies were originally introduced in 2021 as part of the Biden administration\u2019s COVID-19 relief package. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a nonpartisan health policy research group, without the subsidies, insurance premiums are expected to more than double next year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that an additional two million people could become uninsured. Democrats are already preparing to use these anticipated consequences against the Republican Party in the upcoming midterm elections, hoping to replicate the 2018 midterm outcome when Republicans lost partial control of the House due to their prior efforts to repeal the ACA. A White House official stated that Trump must personally announce the plan, and until then, all reports about the administration\u2019s healthcare stance are speculative. The proposal is likely to include a mechanism allowing some enrollees in lower-tier insurance plans to redirect federal aid into health savings accounts. Trump has repeatedly called for a system that channels federal funds directly to individuals to help them purchase coverage, rather than funneling money to insurance companies through the current support program.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5317882)\n\n**U.S. Government Efficiency Department: No Early Dissolution, Official Denies Media Claims**\nAccording to the Xinhua News Agency, Scott Cooper, Administrator of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, denied on November 24, 2025, via social media that the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency had been dissolved eight months early, calling the report 'a sensational headline' created by media that misrepresented his words.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that cabinet officials would continue to work closely with political appointees from the department. Musk\u2019s resignation followed a public split with Trump over the 'Big and Beautiful' Act. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), in a report released in late July 2025, found that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) caused over $21 billion in fiscal waste during its first six months, failing to achieve cost savings.

The withdrawal halted or significantly reduced critical programs in food security, education, HIV/AIDS care, youth employment, and government services. By October 2025, Mozambique accounted for 11% of global ISIS-linked violence, with 79% of the group\u2019s global activity recorded in Africa between January and October. On September 7, 2025, ISIS attacked Mocimboa da Praia, beheading dozens of mostly Christian men and forcing thousands to flee. The local hospital lost up to 15 staff and lacks basic medicines, while a $70,000 fishing program for youth\u2014key targets for ISIS recruiters\u2014was suspended. In Mueda, up to a dozen aid workers departed, leaving 93,000 displaced people with diminished support. The UN appeal for Cabo Delgado dropped from $352 million to $126 million, with only $73.2 million received by October, of which just $3.5 million came from the US. USAID had provided $586 million in 2024\u2014about 3% of Mozambique\u2019s GDP\u2014and over $2.4 billion in ongoing or planned projects were left in limbo.

Despite its initial high visibility and mandate to radically reduce federal spending, staff, and programs, Doge's operational independence has eroded, with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Kupor confirming that the department no longer exists as a centralized entity. Responsibilities were gradually absorbed by OPM and the Office of Management and Budget, which now institutionalize Doge\u2019s structural changes. Doge\u2019s tenure was marked by controversial actions: over 200,000 federal workers were laid off, and approximately 75,000 accepted buyouts, with internal claims of $214 billion in savings\u2014figures disputed by analysts due to lack of transparency and verifiable accounting. The shutdown of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) led to severe global health consequences, with epidemiologist Brooke Nichols estimating over 600,000 excess deaths linked to the loss of malaria prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, and vaccine programs. Internal uncertainty grew after Elon Musk\u2019s 130-day contract ended on May 30, 2025, and staff reportedly packed up personal belongings from headquarters. Musk, who once held up a chainsaw at CPAC to symbolize his anti-bureaucracy mission, has since distanced himself from the operation.

States like Idaho and Florida have launched their own Doge-style efficiency offices. While Doge\u2019s direct operations have ceased, its legacy persists through ongoing deregulation, AI-driven regulatory review, and visual modernization of government websites. The White House maintains that Trump continues to deliver on his mandate to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, though critics argue the initiative caused lasting harm to public services.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 05:29 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/trump-doge-shutdown-musk-what-really-happened-13953470.html)\n\n**Collapse of U.S. Aid Fuels Resurgence of ISIS in Mozambique Amid Escalating Crisis**\nThe collapse of U.S. aid programs, following the executive order by former President Donald Trump to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in January 2025, has significantly contributed to the resurgence of ISIS's 'Central Africa Province' in Mozambique. The withdrawal of aid\u2014amounting to $586 million in 2024, or roughly 3% of Mozambique\u2019s GDP\u2014disrupted critical programs including emergency food, clean water, education, local governance support, and HIV medication funding (partially $160 million). This abrupt funding halt, which affected $2.4 billion in ongoing or planned projects, created a vacuum that enabled militants to expand their influence. According to ACLED data, 79% of global ISIS activity from January to October 2025 occurred in Africa, with Mozambique accounting for 11% of global violence linked to the group in October. In Mocimboa da Praia, ISIS militants reasserted control, executing at least eight men\u2014seven decapitated\u2014prompting over 90,000 people to flee. Former USAID officials stated that the sudden cessation of programs removed vital social and economic safeguards, exacerbating poverty, despair, and marginalization\u2014key drivers of insurgency. With humanitarian workers leaving, aid offices closing, and UN funding reduced from $352 million to $126 million (with only $73.2 million received, $3.5 million from the U.S.), camps like Lianda now offer only one month of emergency aid. Despite the security crisis, major LNG projects by TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil continue near conflict zones, supported by a $4.7 billion EXIM Bank loan, raising concerns over development in unstable regions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[al-ain.com](https://al-ain.com/article/isis-terrorism-poverty-us-aid-mozambique)\n\n**The Monthslong Legal Battle to Save Foreign Aid**\nA nearly nine-month-long legal battle over President Donald Trump's attempt to cut $4 billion in foreign aid funding\u2014appropriated by Congress under President Joe Biden\u2014has repeatedly reached the Supreme Court, with the case reviewed by 21 judges and generating thousands of pages of filings. The lawsuit, filed by the Global Health Council, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, and other nonprofits, challenged Trump\u2019s blanket suspension of foreign aid, which disrupted humanitarian missions, halted supply chains, and led to rotting food and expired medicine abroad. In February 2025, Judge Amir H. Ali ruled the freeze likely unlawful and ordered the release of $2 billion in back payments. The Supreme Court initially upheld this, blocking the freeze. However, the administration dissolved USAID, cut over 80% of its programs\u2014including PEPFAR\u2014and invoked a controversial 'pocket rescission' to bypass Congress, claiming constitutional authority to impound funds. In August, a D.C. Circuit panel ruled only the comptroller general could sue on Congress\u2019s behalf, stalling the case. The Supreme Court then, on September 26, 2025, issued a preliminary emergency order blocking Judge Ali\u2019s $10 billion disbursement order, allowing the funds to remain frozen. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, calling the decision 'uncharted territory' and warning of catastrophic global harm. Despite lower court rulings in favor of the aid groups, the administration has continued to withhold funds, with Congress offering no resistance. Lawyers like Stephen K. Wirth argue the case is less about foreign policy and more about asserting executive power over Congress. The legal dispute remains unresolved, with the damage to global health and development efforts already substantial.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/twisted-path-foreign-aid-court-case.html)\n\n**The Trump Administration's Foreign Aid Review: Status of PEPFAR | KFF**\nThe Trump administration's foreign aid review, initiated on the first day of its second term, has significantly disrupted U.S. global health programs, particularly the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Executive actions included a 90-day foreign aid review, a stop-work order freezing all payments and services, the dissolution of USAID (including the reduction of most staff and contractors), and the cancellation of most foreign assistance awards. Although a limited waiver issued on February 1, 2025, allowed continuation of 'life-saving HIV services'\u2014specifically HIV treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and HIV testing\u2014other critical services like PrEP for non-pregnant individuals and programming for orphans and vulnerable children were prohibited. The stop-work order halted antiretroviral therapy and forced implementers to lay off thousands of staff. Of 770 global health awards identified, 86% were canceled, including 71% of HIV-related awards. Legal challenges have yielded limited success: a preliminary injunction was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on standing grounds, and the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the government\u2019s right to withhold funds. USAID was permanently dissolved and its functions absorbed into the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy (GHSD), while CDC staffing reductions threaten further implementation capacity. Despite the FY 2025 Continuing Resolution providing $4.85 billion in level funding for PEPFAR, the administration\u2019s FY 2026 budget request proposes only $2.9 billion\u2014a $1.9 billion reduction. The administration announced a partnership with the Global Fund to deliver long-acting injectable PrEP to up to 2 million people by 2028, continuing a Biden-era initiative. The September 2025 'America First Global Health Strategy' reorients global health priorities toward U.S. national interests. Reports confirm severe impacts: 71% of PEPFAR partners canceled at least one activity, 50% reported staff reductions, and only 14% could sustain operations beyond one month without funding. UNAIDS documented loss of thousands of HIV health workers in Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Angola, Eswatini, and Ukraine. WHO assessments found moderate to severe disruptions in HIV services across nearly half of surveyed countries.

The stop-work order halted bilateral global health programming, forcing implementers to lay off thousands of staff and suspend services. Although waivers were issued for select life-saving services\u2014such as PEPFAR, TB, malaria, maternal and child health, nutrition, and infectious disease outbreak response\u2014access remained difficult and services stayed disrupted. The dissolution of USAID and proposed cuts to CDC have significantly reduced implementation capacity. Additional actions include the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, withdrawal from the World Health Organization, and a review of international organization participation. In September 2025, the administration released the 'America First Global Health Strategy,' focusing on HIV, TB, malaria, polio, and global health security under three pillars: making America safer, stronger, and more prosperous. The FY 2026 budget request proposes a $6.2 billion reduction in global health funding through foreign assistance, with a rescission package that initially sought to cut $400 million from PEPFAR and $500 million from other programs\u2014though Congress exempted PEPFAR, maternal and child health, TB, malaria, and nutrition from rescission, while allowing $500 million in family planning and other programs to be cut. Key uncertainties remain regarding program reorganization, leadership appointments (including the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and U.S. Malaria Coordinator), and the development of bilateral agreements to scale down funding. The future of U.S. global health efforts depends on these unresolved structural and financial decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[KFF](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-proposed-reorganization-of-u-s-global-health-programs/)\n\n**South Africa Celebrates U.S. Plan to Fund HIV Program**\nSouth Africa has celebrated the U.S. plan to fund the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has been credited with saving over 25 million lives from HIV over two decades, primarily in Africa. South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV globally. In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending all foreign aid to South Africa, including PEPFAR. Although a temporary 90-day exemption was granted, the U.S. began canceling grants by late February 2025, leaving most funds frozen or halted, resulting in job losses and disruptions to services.

Then Trump cut foreign aid**\nOn January 20, 2024, the first day of Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid, leading to the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This action severely disrupted HIV programs in Lesotho, a small southern African nation with one of the world\u2019s highest HIV infection rates. Prior to the cuts, nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid\u2014primarily through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\u2014had helped Lesotho achieve significant progress, including reaching UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal by late 2023. However, after the aid freeze, Lesotho lost at least 23% of its PEPFAR funding, resulting in the closure of clinics, layoffs of 1,500 health workers, and the suspension of HIV prevention programs targeting mother-to-child transmission, male circumcision, and high-risk groups. Patients began rationing medication, and health workers like Lisebo Lechela and Mapapali Mosoeunyane reported a collapse in services, with many fearing death due to interrupted treatment. Although the U.S. State Department announced in September 2024 a six-month bridge program to reinstate some lifesaving initiatives\u2014including testing, treatment, and a new long-acting HIV prevention shot\u2014implementation remains slow and uncertain. Lesotho, which funded only 12% of its health budget domestically, now faces a crisis in sustaining its HIV response. Health officials and experts warn that the cuts have set back progress by at least 15 years and risk reversing decades of gains, with UNAIDS warning up to 4 million global deaths could occur without restored funding. Despite some temporary relief, many in Lesotho feel betrayed and hopeless, with health workers and patients alike expressing despair over the loss of life-saving support. As of October 2025, no formal agreement has been secured, and hundreds of health workers remain unemployed despite verbal promises of absorption into the national system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 08:17 AM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/lesotho-hiv-aids-trump-africa-b2846428.html)\n\n**Trump administration's new global health aid strategy focuses on...**\nThe U.S. State Department announced on Thursday a shift in its foreign health assistance strategy to multiyear bilateral agreements with recipient countries, aiming to reduce waste and align aid with American interests. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, 'We must keep what is good about our health foreign assistance programs while rapidly fixing what is broken,' and added that the U.S. will remain the world\u2019s health leader but will do so in a way that directly benefits the American people and promotes national interest. The new approach follows President Trump\u2019s transactional style, building on his departure from traditional U.S. aid that he said had strayed from American values. The administration has already dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and cut billions of congressionally approved aid dollars, including a freeze that paused funding for the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26\u202fmillion lives. Under the new plan, countries will receive more \u2018skin in the game,\u2019 with aid tied to negotiations that encourage recipient governments to reduce dependence on U.S. assistance. The State Department said global health programs have become inefficient and wasteful, and will focus future dollars on drugs, diagnostic kits and frontline needs while shifting program management and technical assistance to recipient governments. The strategy will be negotiated over the next months, with new agreements expected by spring\u202f2026, and will keep supporting HIV\u2011stricken areas in Africa while redirecting more funding to partners in the Western Hemisphere and Asia\u2011Pacific.

PEPFAR, which has saved more than 26\u202fmillion lives in the last two decades, delivered antiretroviral drugs to 20.6\u202fmillion people last year and supported 342,000 health workers across more than 50 countries.  The Trump administration dismantled USAID early this year, freezing foreign aid; the State Department later issued an exemption for life\u2011saving services, but many initiatives have still been terminated.  NGOs report shortages of medication, staff cuts, suspended community outreach, and rising stigma and mortality in countries such as Uganda, the Philippines and Tanzania.  M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res warned that \"PEPFAR faces an uncertain future\" and that the program\u2019s scope has \"decreased dramatically since January\".  World Vision\u2019s Kenyan program, which focused on orphaned children and prevention, was also cancelled.  Budget documents show that only about US$2.9\u202fbillion of the US$6\u202fbillion allocated for 2025 has been released, with the remainder listed as \"unassigned\" and tied to a spending plan yet to be approved.  Congressional aides and senators, including Susan Collins and Patty Murray, have criticized the Office of Management and Budget for blocking funds, arguing that the law requires all congressional appropriations to be used for PEPFAR\u2019s day\u2011to\u2011day work.  Trump\u2019s administration has also announced a plan to cancel US$4.9\u202fbillion of approved foreign aid, a move deemed illegal by the Office of Government Accountability and upheld by a federal judge.

The cuts are already harming patients and halting projects worldwide. PEPFAR, which has saved more than 26\u202fmillion lives over the past two decades, provided antiretroviral drugs to 20.6\u202fmillion people last year and supported 342\u202f000 health workers in more than 50 countries. The program was originally run by USAID, which the Trump administration dismantled early this year after a freeze on foreign aid. The State Department issued an exemption for life\u2011saving services, but many projects have still been terminated. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res says \u2018PEPFAR faces an uncertain future\u2019 and that \u2018the scope of work has been drastically reduced since January.\u2019 World Vision\u2019s Margaret Schuler noted that \u2018the program that focused on orphans and vulnerable children was cancelled.\u2019 ONUSIDA reports that 28 of its 70 offices have seen community services end, and 21 have seen NGO services stop. The Office of Management and Budget has released only $2.9\u202fbillion of the $6\u202fbillion allocated for 2025, leaving the rest \u2018unassigned.\u2019 Senators Susan Collins and Patty Murray have criticized the OMB for blocking funds, with Collins saying \u2018the money simply isn\u2019t reaching those who need it.\u2019 Trump also announced a plan to cancel $4.9\u202fbillion of approved foreign aid, a move that courts have ruled illegal without congressional approval.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 12:50 PM\nSource:[CNN Espa\u00f1ol](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2025/09/13/eeuu/trump-fondos-vih-sida-trax)\n\n**Trump Administration Halts AIDS Relief Funding, Global Treatment Crisis**\nThe Trump administration has halted part of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), causing treatment interruptions and program shutdowns worldwide, CNN reported on September\u202f13\u202f2025.  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) disclosed that only about half of the $6\u202fbillion PEPFAR budget approved by Congress was spent this year, with the remaining billions carried over to the 2026 fiscal year.  Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the law is clear but the money is not reaching the field, adding that such delays will cause \"unnecessary deaths.\"  Republican Senator Susan Collins echoed the concern, noting that \"PEPFAR funds are blocked and patients are not receiving care.\"  President Trump separately announced the cancellation of $4.9\u202fbillion in overseas aid that had already been approved, provoking backlash from both parties.  A federal judge recently ruled that the administration cannot suspend foreign aid without congressional approval, yet the White House is seeking a Supreme Court review.  The United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) warned that dozens of countries\u2014including Uganda, the Philippines and Tanzania\u2014are experiencing drug shortages, reduced clinic staffing, halted community outreach, increased stigma and rising mortality.  M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) warned that the program cuts \"go beyond inventory shortages and are collapsing the supply chain,\" adding that \"drug transport and distribution have effectively stopped.\"  World Vision reported that its orphan and vulnerable child support and HIV prevention programs in Kenya were terminated, describing the shutdown of life\u2011saving work as \"shocking.\"  PEPFAR, launched in 2003 under President Bush, has saved more than 26\u202fmillion lives and prevented millions of HIV infections over 20\u202fyears, supporting health workers and treatment systems in over 50 countries.  The official PEPFAR activity report has not been released for months, making it difficult to assess the true scale of the impact.  Senior researcher Charles Kenny of the U.S.\u2013U.K. Center for Development Policy noted that \"taxpayers and Congress cannot even confirm what U.S. foreign assistance is achieving.\"  International observers fear that continued funding cuts and execution delays will severely damage the global HIV/AIDS response built over decades.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250913_0003327821)\n\n**Trump\u2019s USAID Cuts Could Kill 14 Million Globally Study Warns - A Humanitarian Disaster on Pandemic Scale - KDRTV**\nOn January\u202f20,\u202f2025 the Trump administration, under Secretary of State Marco\u202fRubio, dissolved the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) via an executive order, imposing a 90\u2011day pause on all foreign development assistance and redirecting aid to the State Department. The order cited that the 'U.S. foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and, in many cases, are antithetical to American values.' The move led to mass layoffs, closure of the Washington,\u202fD.C. headquarters, and termination of thousands of contracts. By July\u202f1,\u202f2025 Rubio announced that 83\u202f% of USAID\u2019s programs\u2014worth $75\u202fbillion\u2014had been eliminated, leaving only 1,000 programs under State Department oversight. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and international organizations, called the action illegal, arguing that agency creation and elimination normally require congressional approval; courts, including the Supreme Court, largely agreed, with a judge ruling the administration likely violated the Constitution by withholding congressionally funded aid. The shutdown removed over 40\u202f% of global foreign aid, abruptly halting programs such as the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which had saved more than 25\u202fmillion lives, and stopping medicine distribution and clinic operations. Conservation initiatives and environmental protection efforts were also halted. A Lancet report estimates that the cuts could lead to 14\u202fmillion deaths worldwide by 2030, including 4.5\u202fmillion children under five. In Kenya, the freeze caused layoffs, crippled health programs, and left vulnerable communities in crisis. Rubio defended the move by citing $165\u202fbillion spent on aid that 'failed to align with American interests at the United Nations' and corruption among NGOs, while critics warned that the withdrawal amounts to a death sentence for millions in developing nations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 10:48 AM\nSource:[kdrtv.co.ke](https://www.kdrtv.co.ke/news/trumps-usaid-cuts-could-kill-14-million-globally-study-warns-a-humanitarian-disaster-on-pandemic-scale/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters are deeply divided on whether PEPFAR will cease to exist before January 1, 2026, with probabilities ranging from 10% to over 90%, and most estimates clustering at the low-to-mid range. Most experts argue that despite massive executive disruption\u2014dissolution of USAID, severe funding cuts, mass layoffs, and deep program contraction\u2014PEPFAR remains a legally distinct program, as Congress has not passed a formal repeal or fully eliminated funding, and essential carve-outs/waivers preserve minimal operations. Key obstacles to total cessation include statutory inertia, court interventions blocking some executive actions, ongoing (if minimal) appropriated funds, and the high bar set by the resolution criteria\u2014the program must be eliminated by law, fully merged into another agency for 60 days uninterrupted, or entirely defunded. Several forecasters warn, however, that PEPFAR is a 'zombie program'\u2014functionally gutted, with its identity and mission nearly lost as global health functions are absorbed into the State Department. Experts who forecast higher probabilities cite: (1) aggressive and largely unchecked Trump administration actions restructuring or terminating agencies, (2) congressional gridlock and lack of effective bipartisan defense, (3) court decisions that have allowed unprecedented impoundment and executive encroachment, and (4) the rapid venue shift and absorption of the program\u2019s core activities. Two forecasters assign probabilities above 70%, predicting absorption/elimination will meet fine print before the deadline given the severe political and institutional disruption. In contrast, the majority view (supported by close readings of appropriations and legal precedents) asserts that, so long as a discrete legal/organizational shell persists with some public funding or waivers, the question resolves \"No,\" and outright program extinction remains unlikely before January 2026. News of partial grants, bridge funding, and a rump PEPFAR office at the State Department supports this lower base rate. Even among high-probability forecasters, there is conceded uncertainty, as the technical legal definition may allow the program to survive minimally. In sum: nearly all experts agree PEPFAR is organizationally and operationally devastated, but most judge that the statutory, bureaucratic, and appropriation hurdles make full legal extinction by the resolution deadline improbable\u2014barring a sudden, court-unblocked executive action or unprecedented congressional move in December. The median probability of PEPFAR ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, is thus in the 10\u201320% range, with expert outliers contending 70\u201390% risk if current eliminations are uninterrupted.",
