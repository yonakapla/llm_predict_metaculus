The far\u2011right Progress Party (FRP) doubled its share to about 24\u202f%. Prime Minister\u2011elect Jonas\u202fGahr\u202fSt\u00f8re will seek either a coalition with the other left parties or outside support for a minority AP government. The four smaller left\u2011bloc parties \u2013 Centre (SP), Socialist Left (SV), Red and Greens (MDG) \u2013 together hold 35\u202f% of the seats. The article notes that the parties approved a 12\u2011year military\u2011spending plan that will add 600\u202fbn\u202fkroner (\u2248\u202f\u20ac50\u202fbn) to the defence budget, including 136\u202fbn\u202fkroner for five frigates, and a new Arctic strategy \u201cNorway in the North\u201d. It also reports that the government will provide 85\u202fbn\u202fkroner to Ukraine in 2025. The GPFG, valued at \u20ac1.7\u202ftrillion, is capped at 3\u202f% annual spending, so the war\u2011related budget is funded at the expense of public services. Energy prices hit a record high in December\u202f2024, and Labour\u2019s popularity fell to 14\u202f% in polls. The Centre Party left the coalition, dropping from 13\u202f% in 2021 to 5.6\u202f%. St\u00f8re appointed former NATO Secretary\u2011General Jens\u202fStoltenberg as Finance Minister and introduced a \u201cNorway price\u201d of 0.4\u202fkroner per kWh, effective 1\u202fOctober. Trade Union Confederation (LO) leader Kine\u202fAsper\u202fVistnes praised the result, saying 'Our social model is based on freedom, equality, and solidarity, and it has proven itself well equipped to handle crises and transitions.' The article criticises the right\u2011wing parties for supporting NATO militarism and war, and portrays the new government as likely to deepen Norway\u2019s involvement in the conflict with Russia.

These results give a red\u2011green coalition a total of 87 seats, ahead of the 82 seats that right\u2011wing parties would hold. The outcome, which confirms pre\u2011election polls, was celebrated at the Labour Party\u2019s electoral headquarters, as reported by the Norwegian newspaper 'Verdens\u202fGang'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 07:36 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-partidos-izquierda-ganan-estrecho-margen-elecciones-noruega-primeros-resultados-20250908213639.html)\n\n**Norway's Labour government set to win reelection, early projections show**\nNorway's minority Labour Party government is projected to narrowly win the September\u202f8,\u202f2025 parliamentary election.  According to projections released by broadcasters NRK and TV2 and the daily VG as voting concluded, the left\u2011wing bloc of Labour and four smaller parties is expected to secure 87 seats\u2014just above the 85\u2011seat threshold required for a majority\u2014while the right\u2011wing coalition led by the Progress Party and the Conservatives is projected to obtain 82 seats.  These figures suggest the Labour\u2011led minority government will retain power, as reported by Reuters and published by ThePrint on September\u202f8,\u202f2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/world/norways-labour-government-set-to-win-reelection-early-projections-show/2738930/)\n\n**Norway Election Polls: Social Democratic Labour Party Surprises with Surge**\nThe article reports on the latest opinion polls for Norway\u2019s September\u202f2025 parliamentary election. According to the polls, the Social Democratic Labour Party (Arbeiterpartei) is leading with 27.1\u202f% of the vote, which would translate into 52 seats out of the 169 in the Storting. The article cites the poll data table: 'Arbeiterpartei 27,1 (52)', 'Fortschrittspartei 21,0 (42)', 'Hoyre 14,4 (26)', 'Umweltpartei Die Gr\u00fcnen 6,2 (9)', 'Rot 6,0 (9)', 'Sozialistische Linkspartei 6,0 (9)', 'Zentrumspartei 5,9 (9)', 'Christliche Volkspartei 4,7 (7)', 'Liberale 4,3 (6)', 'Sonstige 4,4 (0)'. It notes that the Labour Party currently holds only 48 of the 169 seats, but a minority government is common in Norway. The piece stresses that the polls are snapshots of public opinion, not predictions, and that a statistical error margin of up to three percentage points applies. The article also highlights that the polls show a slight advantage for the centre\u2011left coalition, which could allow Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re to remain in office with a single\u2011party minority government if the coalition wins a majority.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 07:36 AM\nSource:[mannheim24.de](https://www.mannheim24.de/politik-wirtschaft/hoehenflug-umfragen-zur-norwegen-wahl-sozialdemokratische-arbeiterpartei-ueberraschend-auf-zr-93921225.html)\n\n**The Ultra\u2011Right Threatens the Moderate Left\u2019s Victory in Norway\u2019s Elections**\nNorway\u2019s parliamentary election on 6\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 will involve 4\u202fmillion voters choosing among 169 seats in the Storting. The centre\u2011left coalition, led by the Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet) and Prime Minister Jonas\u202fGahr\u202fSt\u00f8re, currently holds a slight advantage with 27\u202f% of the vote in recent polls, compared with 22\u202f% for the right\u2011wing Progress Party (FrP) and 14\u202f% for the Conservative Party (H\u00f8yre). Small parties could be decisive because only those surpassing the 4\u202f% threshold enter parliament; the current poll average gives the centre\u2011left 88 seats and the opposition 81. The Progress Party, founded in 1973 and now led by ultra\u2011right\u2011wing Sylvi\u202fListhaug, has doubled its support since 2021, when it received 11.6\u202f% of the vote. If the centre\u2011left wins, St\u00f8re is expected to remain prime minister for another four years; if the right wins, the next prime minister could be Listhaug or Conservative leader Erna\u202fSolberg. The election is framed by economic issues such as the high cost of living, taxes, electricity prices and management of Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. No party is expected to reach the 85 seats needed for an absolute majority, so the winner will likely govern in minority or form a coalition. The article notes that the \u2018efecto\u202fJens\u202fStoltenberg\u2019 \u2013 the boost from former NATO secretary\u2011general Jens\u202fStoltenberg\u2019s return to Norwegian politics \u2013 has helped the Labour Party gain ten points in recent polls. The article also highlights the broader international context, including the return of Donald\u202fTrump to the White House, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, and Norway\u2019s NATO membership and Arctic border with Russia.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 06:11 PM\nSource:[Sur](https://www.diariosur.es/internacional/europa/auge-ultra-amenaza-triunfo-izquierda-moderada-elecciones-20250906201143-ntrc.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts unanimously concluded that the Liberal Party (Venstre) did not win the most seats in the 2025 Norwegian parliamentary election. Their analyses, grounded in diverse fields such as Bayesian modeling, multilevel regression poststratification, public opinion research, political science, sociology, and Nordic studies, consistently emphasize several key points: (1) The Liberal Party received only 2\u20133 seats, failing to cross the crucial 4% national vote threshold required for proportional (compensatory) seats, as confirmed by multiple official and media sources; (2) Labour Party won the most seats, followed by the Progress Party and Conservatives, with seat counts for these major parties vastly outstripping those of Venstre; (3) Norway\u2019s electoral law and historical base rates make it structurally prohibitive for Venstre to achieve a plurality, especially given the multiparty landscape and the mechanics of the Storting electoral system; (4) There was no evidence of late swings, realignment shocks, or counting/reporting errors that could plausibly enable a Liberal win. As a result, every expert assigns a final probability at or extremely close to zero (0-1%) for the Liberal Party winning the most seats, with the only minuscule probability residual ascribed to hypothetical and unprecedented reporting or certification mishaps, for which there is no documented evidence. In summary, consensus among experts, buttressed by empirical results and institutional analysis, is that the answer to the question is a definitive 'No'.",
