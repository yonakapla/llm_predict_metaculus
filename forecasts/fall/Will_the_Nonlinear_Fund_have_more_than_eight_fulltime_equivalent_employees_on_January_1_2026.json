Major funding or a sudden strategic mandate for scale would be required, and there is no evidence as yet of either. Thus, the justified probability that Nonlinear Fund will have more than eight full-time equivalent employees on January 1, 2026 is quite low.

In fact, as reflected across BoardSource governance best practices and actual nonprofit behavior, most new AI safety nonprofits\u2014even when in the midst of sectoral tailwinds\u2014face Board-imposed constraints on growth and are unlikely to expand from small to >8 FTEs in the absence of a discrete, public, and sustained resource influx.

Population Ecology may underweight the friction from wage competition, endogenous staff burnout, and scarcity of mission-aligned, affordable candidates, especially as nonprofits often depend on idiosyncratic labor market matches. Furthermore, dramatic scaling from micro-sized to 9+ FTEs under the strict FTE measure would, empirically, require not just sectoral legitimacy but targeted, well-publicized funding and explicit recruitment, none of which is visible for Nonlinear Fund in the current cycle.

The motion, introduced by David Garcia Nu\u00f1ez (AL) and Anna Graff (SP), seeks to reduce working hours to 35 per week while keeping full pay, targeting staff in the VBZ, police and care sectors. Leupi cited high costs and the risk that reduced hours could leave up to 1,500 specialists short.

The motioners accused the council of a delay tactic and demanded the matter be referred to a commission. The council rejected the extension request, leaving Leupi to answer the commission. The debate echoes a 2023 pilot in hospitals where 70 assistant doctors worked 42 hours instead of 46. 45\u202f% of Swiss workers reported that resources and burdens in their work life are just balancing, according to recent surveys.

A ministry\u2011appointed mediator has been assigned to help negotiate a settlement. Dayna Smockum, Director of Communications for the Ministry of Colleges, Universities, Research Excellence and Security, said the mediator is ready to support a fair resolution and that the goal is to put students first: 'We remain hopeful that all parties reach a fair deal that puts students first.' OPSEU Local\u202f421 President Tim Prewer said picket lines allow only one vehicle at a time and that the college has not yet met with members; he also highlighted safety concerns and requested a meeting on the line: 'Members would like to be able to have multiple vehicles safely line up off of Wallbridge\u2011Loyalist Road and further along the college roadway.'

City Manager Wendy Stephanson announced on August\u202f26 that the mandate would take effect on Jan.\u202f1, stating that a five\u2011day office standard would strengthen organizational culture and build public trust. Councillor Jeff Leiper will introduce a motion arguing that no evidence shows reduced productivity or taxpayer value under the current hybrid arrangement, and that a five\u2011day standard would not significantly improve either. The motion would direct the city manager to rescind the mandate and continue to accommodate hybrid work. Horizon Ottawa and several unions\u2014including the Civic Institute of Professional Personnel, the Amalgamated Transit Union, the Canadian Association of Professional Employees and the Public Service Alliance of Canada\u2014will rally outside City Hall to support Leiper\u2019s motion. Tom Ledgley, Coordinator of Horizon Ottawa, said, 'Remote work technology and practices are well\u2011developed and effective,' and that studies show productivity remains strong when people work from home. Ottawa employs about 17,100 full\u2011time equivalent positions, with roughly 85\u202f% of staff onsite each day. Stephanson clarified that alternative work arrangements will remain available, and that a regular on\u2011site presence is 'critical to help strengthen relationships, reinforce team norms, support formal systems and processes, facilitate ongoing knowledge transfer, support mentorship and succession planning, protect the integrity of our corporate memory, build confidence in the city's ability to deliver service excellence, and ultimately strengthen public trust.' The motion comes amid Ontario\u2019s mandate that all members of the Ontario Public Service be in the office four days a week from November, and federal core public service employees must be in the office at least three days a week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 12:29 PM\nSource:[Pulse24.com                        ](https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/09/24/council-to-vote-today-on-motion-to-rescind-ottawas-return-to-office-mandate/)\n\n**Financial Union Calls for Nationwide Strike Over 4.5\u2011Day Workweek and Wage Increase**\nThe Financial Union of Korea announced a nationwide strike on 26\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, the first such action since September\u202f2022.  The strike, scheduled to begin at 11\u202fa.m. on Gwanghwamun Sejong-daero, is aimed at securing a 4.5\u2011day workweek, a 5\u202f% wage increase (later revised to 3.9\u202f%) and additional hiring and retirement\u2011extension measures.  Employers have offered only a 2.4\u202f% raise and have opposed the shorter workweek.  Union chair Kim\u202fHyung\u2011seon said the union has \u201cbeen demanding a 4.5\u2011day week to overcome national crises such as low birth rates, care gaps and regional decline, yet no responsible answer has been given for months.\u201d  He also criticized that while banks and financial firms enjoy record profits, the share returned to workers is \u201ctoo modest.\u201d  Historically, participation in the 2022 strike was only 0.8\u202f% among the five major banks and 9.4\u202f% overall.  Bank officials expect that even if the strike proceeds, low participation will prevent major disruptions to branch operations.  Banks have prepared emergency plans, monitoring staff levels in real time and planning phased responses to minimize customer inconvenience.  Public sentiment remains lukewarm; many consumers fear that a shortened branch\u2011operating schedule would inconvenience them.  The government plans to legislate a reduction in statutory working hours within the year, raising questions about the strike\u2019s effectiveness.  The union claims it has held more than 35 negotiations over several months, but the employer side has \u201cevaded responsibility,\u201d prompting the union\u2019s 100,000 members to go on strike.  \"\uc218\uac1c\uc6d4\uac04 35\ucc28\ub840 \ub118\uac8c \uad50\uc12d\uc744 \uc774\uc5b4\uc654\uc73c\ub098 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uce21\uc740 \ub05d\ub0b4 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ud68c\ud53c\ud588\ub2e4,\" the union said, emphasizing its resolve.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250925_0003344557)\n\n**SBIR And STTR Programs To Expire Without Continuing Resolution Passage**\nThe U.S. House passed a continuing resolution (CR) that funds the federal government through November 21, 2025, but the Senate must act by September 30 to avoid a shutdown. If the Senate fails to pass the CR, key programs that small businesses and federal agencies rely on\u2014namely the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs\u2014will be at risk. These programs, dubbed 'America's Seed Fund', were created in 1982 and 1992 respectively, and together award grants to more than 4,000 recipients, creating an average of 65,578 jobs per year. Notable innovations funded include lasik eye surgery and the Mars Perseverance Rover. Although the current CR includes funding for SBIR and STTR through fiscal year 2026, the programs still require reauthorization by Congress; disagreement remains over whether to simply reauthorize or to redesign them. A government shutdown would harm both Main Street businesses and federal operations, underscoring the importance of passing the CR and securing the future of SBIR and STTR.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 02:26 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/2025/09/25/sbir-and-sttr-programs-to-expire-without-continuing-resolution-passage/)\n\n**More Companies Revert to Office Work: A Mistake That Could Cost Them**\nCompanies are increasingly mandating a full\u2011time return to the office, citing productivity gains, but recent studies suggest the shift may not deliver the promised benefits. A 2024 S&P\u202f500 survey found that firms often impose in\u2011person mandates after stock\u2011price declines, aiming to boost employee performance and financial results. However, a Fast\u202fCompany article notes that hybrid work does not harm productivity; the real drop comes from insufficient investment in technology and systems that enable employees to perform at their best. The Australian Productivity Commission reports that hybrid arrangements do not reduce output, and that the main performance loss stems from outdated infrastructure and inefficient processes. For many firms, office space represents 10\u201120\u202f% of operating costs; a return mandate requires at least 15\u202fm\u00b2 per worker, plus utilities, heating, cooling, high\u2011speed internet, etc. Telework has also improved work\u2011life balance, with employees in cities like Atlanta saving 2\u20113\u202fhours daily on commuting, which could be redirected to focus and creative problem\u2011solving. Stanford research shows that workers who telework two days a week are as productive, equally likely to be promoted, and 33\u202f% less likely to resign than full\u2011time office workers. Other studies find remote and hybrid setups reduce sick leave, limit distractions, and increase satisfaction. The article argues that forcing a five\u2011day office schedule without clear objectives or empathy risks eroding corporate culture, trust, and engagement, and that the future lies in greater flexibility benefiting both employers and employees. Key quotes include: the article refers to a \"100% pr\u00e9sentiel\" policy, cites \"33% moins de risques de d\u00e9missionner\" for hybrid workers, and notes that office costs can be \"10 \u00e0 20% de leurs co\u00fbts d'exploitation\".\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Slate.fr](https://www.slate.fr/societe/teletravail-bureau-presentiel-entreprise-productivite-bien-etre-vie-personnel-professionnel-travail)\n\n**U.S. Startups Embrace Chinese 996 Work Culture**\nU.S. startups are increasingly adopting the Chinese \"996\" work culture, demanding employees work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, and in many cases 70+ hour weeks.

The survey found that more than 90% of respondents said they would '\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b' (take action) if they lost the right to work remotely or even in a hybrid model that requires at least one office visit per week. The study also shows a steep decline in fully remote workers\u2014from 7% in 2024 to 4% in 2025\u2014and a rise in office staff from 42% to 51% over the same period. Hybrid workers fell from 51% to 45%, with 40% now required to work three days a week and 27% four days. Only 34% of hybrid workers would prefer a three\u2011day office schedule, and 11% would not want to appear at all. The report cites that 75% of UK employers have not tightened mandatory office presence, yet companies such as Vodafone and Microsoft are actively pushing for returns. Indeed\u2019s research notes that employers are using the labour market to demand more face\u2011to\u2011face interaction for collaboration, culture or simply because they feel they can: '\u041c\u044b \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u2026' The findings suggest a growing disconnect between employer expectations and employee preferences for flexibility.

A ministry\u2011appointed mediator has been assigned to help negotiate a settlement. Dayna Smockum, Director of Communications for the Ministry of Colleges, Universities, Research Excellence and Security, said the mediator is ready to support a fair resolution and that the goal is to put students first: 'We remain hopeful that all parties reach a fair deal that puts students first.' OPSEU Local\u202f421 President Tim Prewer said picket lines allow only one vehicle at a time and that the college has not yet met with members; he also highlighted safety concerns and requested a meeting on the line: 'Members would like to be able to have multiple vehicles safely line up off of Wallbridge\u2011Loyalist Road and further along the college roadway.' CEC CEO Graham Lloyd said the council has offered more than $145\u202fmillion in wage, benefit and job\u2011security improvements and is willing to meet in mediation on September\u202f26,\u202f2025, hoping to end the strike: 'Colleges have consistently bargained in good faith and have put forward more than $145\u202fmillion in improved wages, benefits, and job security, and advised OPSEU of issues it cannot accept.'

City Manager Wendy Stephanson announced on August\u202f26 that the mandate would take effect on Jan.\u202f1, stating that a five\u2011day office standard would strengthen organizational culture and build public trust. Councillor Jeff Leiper will introduce a motion arguing that no evidence shows reduced productivity or taxpayer value under the current hybrid arrangement, and that a five\u2011day standard would not significantly improve either. The motion would direct the city manager to rescind the mandate and continue to accommodate hybrid work. Horizon Ottawa and several unions\u2014including the Civic Institute of Professional Personnel, the Amalgamated Transit Union, the Canadian Association of Professional Employees and the Public Service Alliance of Canada\u2014will rally outside City Hall to support Leiper\u2019s motion. Tom Ledgley, Coordinator of Horizon Ottawa, said, 'Remote work technology and practices are well\u2011developed and effective,' and that studies show productivity remains strong when people work from home. Ottawa employs about 17,100 full\u2011time equivalent positions, with roughly 85\u202f% of staff onsite each day. Stephanson clarified that alternative work arrangements will remain available, and that a regular on\u2011site presence is 'critical to help strengthen relationships, reinforce team norms, support formal systems and processes, facilitate ongoing knowledge transfer, support mentorship and succession planning, protect the integrity of our corporate memory, build confidence in the city's ability to deliver service excellence, and ultimately strengthen public trust.' The motion comes amid Ontario\u2019s mandate that all members of the Ontario Public Service be in the office four days a week from November, and federal core public service employees must be in the office at least three days a week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 12:29 PM\nSource:[Pulse24.com                        ](https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/09/24/council-to-vote-today-on-motion-to-rescind-ottawas-return-to-office-mandate/)\n\n**Tech giants end remote work model, citing reasons**\nMicrosoft announced on 9 February 2026 that it will require employees to return to the office at least three days a week, ending its long\u2011standing remote\u2011work policy and marking the end of the last major tech company to defend the home\u2011office model. The change follows a broader trend: Apple, Google, Amazon and Meta have already reduced or eliminated flexible work arrangements. Microsoft\u2019s new policy will take effect in the Redmond region and is part of a strategy to improve communication, engagement and data\u2011security control, according to Amy Coleman, the company\u2019s executive vice\u2011president of people. \n\nThe article cites a 2025 Insper report that surveyed 1,432 technology workers. It found that, on average, IT professionals worked 2.64 remote days per week, a level higher than other sectors, and that 94% of respondents want to keep at least one remote day. Moreover, 83% said they would accept a salary reduction to maintain remote work. The study also warned that cutting remote options could raise turnover, especially among women, and affect talent retention.\n\nOther big\u2011tech moves are highlighted: Amazon now requires five office days a week (since 2 January 2025), Google mandates three office days for employees within 80 km (since April 2025), Apple has a fixed hybrid schedule of three office days a week (since September 2022), and Meta continues a three\u2011day\u2011per\u2011week policy (since 2023). \n\nExperts explain that the shift is partly strategic: \"Como demandam mais inova\u00e7\u00e3o do que outras organiza\u00e7\u00f5es, algumas quest\u00f5es acabam se tornando mais importantes, como a complexidade de produtos e servi\u00e7os,\" said Andr\u00e9 Miceli of FGV. \"H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m uma quest\u00e3o de cultura e identidade organizacional: a conviv\u00eancia presencial refor\u00e7a valores importantes para a empresa,\" added Tatiana Iwai of Insper. \n\nThe article also notes that Microsoft cut about 15,000 jobs in 2025, and that Amazon and Meta announced similar layoffs amid AI investments, suggesting that the return to the office may also serve as a way to monitor and reduce workforce size. \n\nQuotes from the article include: \n- 'O caso delas chama aten\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o apenas pelo tamanho e pelo hype, mas tamb\u00e9m porque frequentemente ditam tend\u00eancias de mercado e sempre foram associadas a culturas de grande autonomia e flexibilidade,' said Tatiana Iwai. \n- 'Quando olhamos para os \u00faltimos cinco anos, continuamos a acreditar que as vantagens de estar juntos no escrit\u00f3rio s\u00e3o significativas,' said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. \n- 'Se houver revers\u00e3o total ou consider\u00e1vel do remoto, podemos prever aumento do turnover, diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o, do engajamento e do bem\u2011estar,' concluded Iwai.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 01:44 PM\nSource:[Estad\u00e3o](https://www.estadao.com.br/link/empresas/as-gigantes-da-tecnologia-mataram-o-home-office-apesar-de-suas-ferramentas-digitais-veja-motivos/)\n\n**Meta Insiders Claim Mark Zuckerberg's Company Suppressed Research on Child Safety in Virtual Reality**\nAccording to the Washington Post, documents disclosed to Congress by a group of Meta employees show that the company\u2019s legal team screened, edited, and sometimes vetoed internal research on child safety in virtual reality after leaked studies led to 2021 congressional hearings. The employees allege that Meta\u2019s actions were aimed at creating \u2018plausible deniability\u2019 about any negative effects of its products. Meta denies wrongdoing, stating that since the start of 2022 it has approved nearly 180 Reality Labs\u2011related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well\u2011being. The company claims these studies led to product updates such as new supervision tools that let parents see who their teens are connected with in VR, how much time they spend, and which apps they access, and to automatic protections for teens that limit unwanted contact, such as default voice\u2011channel settings in Horizon Worlds that allow users to hear or be heard only from people they know. A Meta spokesperson told Breitbart, \u2018These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative; in reality since the start of 2022, Meta has approved nearly 180 Reality Labs\u2011related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well\u2011being.\u2019 The documents also reveal that Meta did not create parental controls for \u2018tween\u2019 VR users until the FTC began investigating its compliance with a law meant to protect children online, and that children younger than 13 were bypassing age restrictions to use the company\u2019s VR services. Another Meta spokesperson said, \u2018From the start, we built safety features into our devices and made it clear those devices were meant for people over 13 \u2013 this was stated in the Oculus Safety Center, on the packaging, and in the user guides.\u2019 Former researcher Jason Sattizahn wrote in an affidavit that he was fired after disputes with managers over restrictions on his research, and another researcher quit in 2023 after four years at the company, citing ethical concerns.

The schedule is 37.80 hours in 2024 (1,712 annual hours), 37.50 hours in 2025, and 37.32 hours in 2026. The reduction is conditioned on the legal approval of a maximum ordinary daily duration of 37.5 hours. The agreement also fixes eight production\u2011stop days each year, six of which are common to all four Finsa sites (24\u201125\u202fJuly, 24\u201125\u201131\u202fDecember, 1\u202fJanuary); the remaining two days are set by local company committees and must not exceed four stoppage periods per year. Employees working night shifts during the four Christmas days receive compensation ranging from \u20ac60.97 to \u20ac213.38, depending on the shift. Salary adjustments include a linear 60\u202f% reduction of shift supplements over 2024\u20112026 (20\u202f% per year), with \u20ac528 deducted from shift supplements each year to raise base salaries by \u20ac1.45 per day and \u20ac44 per month for all groups. These increases are paid in the 12 monthly payments and extra payments of the agreement. The agreement also introduces a professional classification model based on development and learning, and ties salary updates to the economic and social sustainability of the activity. Finsa reported \u20ac1.208\u202fbillion in revenue and employed 3,342 staff in the last fiscal year. The article quotes the agreement: 'El convenio colectivo de Finsa establece ocho d\u00edas de parada de fabricaci\u00f3n al a\u00f1o,' and notes the compensation range for night\u2011shift workers: 'los trabajadores que presten servicio en turnos en alguna de las cuatro jornadas navide\u00f1as rese\u00f1adas recibir\u00e1n compensaciones econ\u00f3micas, que van de 60,97 a 213,38 euros.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 05:10 PM\nSource:[La Voz de Galicia](https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/economia/2025/09/09/convenio-laboral-finsa-preve-rebajar-jornada-semanal-debajo-37-horas-ano-2027/0003_202509G9P32993.htm)\n\n**Poland Offers 20,000\u202fz\u0142 per Employee in Short\u2011Work Pilot \u2013 Final Days to Apply**\nThe Polish Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy (MRPiPS) launched a pilot program in August 2024 to test shortened working hours while keeping pay unchanged.  The program invites employers from all sectors to submit proposals for custom work\u2011time models, such as a four\u2011day week, shorter days, longer holidays or flexible start times.  For each employee participating, a company can receive up to 20\u202f000\u202fz\u0142, and the total grant per company can reach 1\u202f000\u202f000\u202fz\u0142.  The Ministry plans to allocate 50\u202f000\u202f000\u202fz\u0142 from the Labour Fund for the entire project, which will run in three phases: preparatory (until end\u20112025), test (full 2026) and summary (until May\u202f2027).  As of 4\u202fSeptember, almost 300 fully completed applications had been received and 1\u202f500 were still in progress, according to the ministry\u2019s head of the department, Agnieszka Dziemianowicz\u2011B\u0105k, who said, 'Te liczby pokazuj\u0105, \u017ce s\u0105 w Polsce pracodawcy, kt\u00f3rzy chc\u0105 skorzysta\u0107 z tej wyj\u0105tkowej szansy skr\u00f3cenia czasu pracy z zachowaniem wynagrodzenia.'  The deadline for submitting applications is 15\u202fSeptember, with results announced by 15\u202fOctober.  A survey by SWPS University found that 65\u202f% of women and 63\u202f% of men are interested in a shorter work week; 36\u202f% of women and 37\u202f% of men favour a four\u2011day week with eight\u2011hour days, while 29\u202f% of women and 19\u202f% of men prefer a five\u2011day week with six\u2011to\u2011seven\u2011hour days or a ten\u2011hour four\u2011day week, respectively.

The company has placed its Newcastle blast furnace into temporary care and maintenance and is preparing for a possible closure that would affect roughly 4,000 jobs, including about 2,000 local positions and 3,500 national positions. AMSA said it has worked with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), government and other stakeholders, but 'Unfortunately, no solution has been concluded yet.' The Newcastle Growth Coalition Chapter, chaired by Johan Pieters, has called for an urgent meeting with AMSA, IDC, provincial and national leaders, and local businesses to discuss the future of the long steel business. Matthew Shunmugam, chair of the Newcastle Residents Forum, warned that the loss of over 2,000 direct jobs and thousands more in the steel value chain would devastate the community, increase unemployment, and harm local GDP. Willie Venter of Solidarity said the retrenchments could trigger a broader industrial crisis. Minister Nomakhosazana Meth noted that a R416,838,844.46 allocation from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) under the Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS) had been secured for 2,982 employees, but the funding collapsed because AMSA could not provide a guarantee against retrenchments.

At the current pace of 20 institutions per week, the commission would need roughly a month to finish the reviews, and the major ministries of Education and Health\u2014whose complexity could extend the schedule to about five weeks\u2014remain pending.  \n\nIn mid\u2011year, Minister of Economy and Finance Felipe\u202fChapman ordered a $1.9\u202fbillion spending containment, forcing several agencies to halt investments and even review payrolls.  The MEF also issued an order to close the fiscal year early, further limiting execution capacity.  Consequently, most of the 18 entities report frozen or cut budgets, which could restrict their 2026 investment plans and may lead the commission to request increases that could push the total state budget above $35\u202f000\u202fmillion. \n\nOfficials attending the hearings often argue that more money will solve management inefficiencies, but the government\u2019s logic is that additional funds can actually amplify waste.  Historically, the state has provided money first and demanded efficiency later, resulting in a rising budget without clear improvements in education, health or security.  The MEF\u2019s containment strategy aims to force better fiscal discipline, though it creates turbulence for agencies that now face a \u201cnew round of increases\u201d to cover their needs. \n\nDuring the hearings, the Tribunal Electoral revealed that it pays private\u2011car insurance for its employees and provides special childcare and medical services.  Deputy Janine\u202fPrado asked, with justified concern, why the Tribunal\u2019s staff do not use the public health system.  The Tribunal replied that its employees work overtime and therefore require such support, a justification that places them above ordinary citizens who also work extra hours but lack comparable benefits. \n\nPrado is the only deputy who has attended and asked questions at all sessions; many colleagues are absent or only attend popular sessions, which hampers the commission\u2019s ability to make balanced cuts or increases.  The lack of participation is especially troubling given that the National Assembly itself has been criticized for its handling of public funds. \n\nThe hearings also highlighted that several institutions owe labor benefits for more than five years, exposing a contradiction: the state demands compliance from the private sector while failing to meet its own obligations.  \n\nKey metrics: \n- 18 institutions presented to the commission; \n- ~100 state institutions in total; \n- Current pace: 20 per week, requiring ~1 month; \n- Major ministries pending, extending schedule to ~5 weeks; \n- $1.9\u202fbillion spending containment; \n- Potential total budget >$35\u202f000\u202fmillion; \n- Housing deficit reported by the Ministry of Housing: ~150\u202f000 units; annual production: 1\u20132\u202fk units; \n- Proposed \u201cgovernment city\u201d at the Ministry of Public Works in Albrook. \n\nThe article presents a critical view of the current budget process, highlighting inefficiencies, privilege disparities, and the need for better fiscal discipline.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 01, 2025 11:56 AM\nSource:[TVN](https://www.tvn-2.com/contenido-exclusivo/presupuesto-2026-recortes-lamentos-ineficiencias_1_2204311.html)\n\n**Shorter Work Hours for Same Pay: High Interest from Companies**\nThe Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy announced a pilot programme for shortened working hours while keeping salaries unchanged.

The program, which will run from 2025 to 2027, will provide 50 million PLN in funding. According to Minister Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-B\u0105k, 'We work to live, not live to work.' The pilot program aims to answer the question of whether and how working time can be shortened while maintaining the same salary. Any employer, regardless of size or sector, can apply to participate in the program. The program will test different models of shortening working time, such as a four-day working week, reduced working hours, or flexible start times. The Ministry of Labor emphasizes the importance of diversity in approaches and the need to find the most effective models of shortening working time. 'Over 50% of Poles want to shorten working time,' said a survey by the SWPS University. The pilot program will be funded by the Labor Fund, with a maximum of 1 million PLN per project. Employers can propose their own projects, tailored to the needs of their employees or the company's conditions and possibilities. The application process is simple, with a electronic form available on the Ministry's website. The deadline for applications is September 15, and the list of selected projects will be published by October 15, 2025.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 03:42 PM\nSource:[Bankier.pl](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Rusza-pilotaz-skroconego-czasu-pracy-mozna-skladac-wnioski-Pracujemy-zeby-zyc-a-nie-zyjemy-zeby-pracowac-8993122.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a strong consensus that the probability of the Nonlinear Fund having more than eight full-time equivalent employees on January 1, 2026, is very low. Most experts\u2014spanning specialties in nonprofit operations, human resources, organizational sociology, nonprofit management, strategic philanthropy, and labor economics\u2014converge on probability estimates of 5% (No) or, in one case, 95% (Yes), though upon inspection, the reasoning in the latter case actually matches a high probability of 'No' (the probability given was interpreted as the chance of the answer being No). Experts cite several common factors: (1) base rates for early-stage AI safety/EA nonprofits indicate very slow staff growth and long periods below the 9-FTE threshold; (2) funding cycles in this field are conservative, with no public record of a major new grant or hiring push for Nonlinear Fund in late 2025; (3) the organization\u2019s structure and sector norms, emphasizing lean operations and project-based work, further decrease the likelihood of fast scaling; and (4) past reputational and sectoral shocks (notably the FTX collapse) have resulted in greater caution by donors and boards, sharply limiting aggressive hiring. While a major and sudden funding influx or sector-wide surge in AI safety concern could enable rapid hiring, no evidence supports this as of now. All experts describe plausible 'yes' scenarios involving unexpected grants or urgent program mandates, but view these as unlikely given current information. The overwhelming conclusion from all perspectives, grounded in sector base rates, funding realities, and resolution criteria requiring public verification, is that Nonlinear Fund will have eight or fewer full-time equivalent employees at the start of 2026.",
