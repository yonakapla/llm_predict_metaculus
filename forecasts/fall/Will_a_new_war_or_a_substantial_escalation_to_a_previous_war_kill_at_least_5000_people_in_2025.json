Other eligible theaters (Venezuela, Mozambique, Cameroon, etc.) show elevated risk but little to no direct evidence they meet the lethality bar as of October. On the other hand, none of the news indicates certainty or direct, globally recognized confirmation of 5,000+ deaths yet; ambiguity or undercounting remain possibilities.

Alternatively, a 'sleeper' conflict in Africa or Latin America erupts into high-intensity war due to coup, foreign intervention, or large, sudden massacre(s), and reports (from UCDP, ACLED, ICRC, or media) confirm death counts of at least 5,000 for the calendar year, pushing the answer to 'yes.'",

The M23 rebellion, with indirect Rwanda support and heavy fighting, is the most plausible ongoing candidate, though credible mass-dead lists are not yet published. The reporting surge in amputees, mass displacements (>7 million), and warnings from the UN and NGOs point to a risk. CrisisWatch and international trackers also highlight DRC, Sudan, and Yemen as acute risks, but as of early October no well-publicized death toll for any qualifying conflict crosses 5,000. There is a substantial 'fat tail' risk: given the fragility and escalatory signals, a surge in casualties is possible in the last quarter. Given the news and indicators, I believe the probability is considerably above the historic median year but still less than 50%, since the threshold remains high, and no conflict is definitively over the mark as of October.

The Democratic Republic of Congo is the leading contender\u2014a combination of news reports and humanitarian indicators (prosthetics demand, mass displacement, direct reports on surging violence since January 2025) strongly suggest escalation. Still, precise casualty estimates remain uncertain, and validation against the <1,000 prior deaths criterion for 2023/24 is essential. Other potential escalation zones (Sudan, Cameroon, Georgia, Venezuela maritime skirmishes) are on the radar but either have not crossed the death threshold or are lower risk given available reporting. Structurally, the base rate of such mass-lethality new wars is low, likely <10% per year even in active historical clusters.

The most plausible candidate is the DRC, where humanitarian reporting indicates extremely high recent violence, sharp increases in injuries/displacements since early 2025, and explicit warnings of military escalation by both rebels and the UN. While the verified death toll is not yet at 5,000, the scope of recent brutality (hundreds of amputees within months, large displacement events, UN and ICRC engagement with mass casualty management) suggests a non-trivial chance of crossing the threshold if present trends continue.

Commercial/prosthetics data (over 800 amputees treated, 7 million displaced) and aerial bombing/droning are suggestive of lethal escalation in 2025.

Other regions (Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria) show risk, but appear less likely to meet the strict eligibility.

Furthermore, there is still no clear, authoritative account of >5,000 conflict deaths in this sector for 2025 as of October, and fatality undercounting, while real, is not an automatic license to place probability near certainty in advance of such data. Structurally, your argument does not sufficiently hedge for the possibility of a late-year plateau or ambiguous resolution, nor for the procedural risk that post-hoc coding will find deaths distributed across multiple eligible/ineligible fronts, or that the escalation fails to fit the fine print. Therefore, your upper-bound forecast, while plausible if all the informants point unambiguously and deaths are ultimately as high as the humanitarian indicators suggest, seems oriented toward the best-case for Yes and insufficiently balanced by the considerable risk that one or more eligibility or evidence hurdles are not cleared by Metaculus or their adjudicated sources."

Several forecasters argue for bold upward adjustment, citing that when several such independent high-lethality proxies (prosthetics demand, rapid displacement, new offensive operations with cross-border/state involvement) converge, the chance of the deaths threshold being reached is likely above my earlier conservative estimate. The lead risk (DRC) now appears not just as a plausible candidate but as a highly probable one for mass-casualty escalation in 2025, and the correlation between amputee numbers, displacement, and eventual confirmed deaths in similar prior cases is strong.

Some forecasters argue for a much higher probability (60%\u201380%) based on these signals. However, the strict eligibility\u2014requiring fewer than 1,000 deaths in BOTH 2023 and 2024\u2014remains in doubt for the DRC based on public data: eastern DRC has skirted or slightly exceeded this line in alternating years according to UCDP and ACLED, leading to real risk of disqualification or post-hoc data corrections. Additionally, no direct, widely-accepted estimates confirm surpassing 5,000 deaths as of October, and battleground reporting and confirmation lags persist. The pro-high-probability cluster is persuasive about likely real-world deaths, but the contest should reward literal adherence to the resolution criteria, with negative weight placed on ambiguity. I therefore moderately revise upward to reflect the near-majority view that the proxy violence signals are very strong, but retain a substantial discount to hedge against data ambiguity and surprises in Metaculus final determination.",

The main upward critiques emphasize the humanitarian indicators in DRC as highly suggestive of mass fatalities, but the stronger, high-confidence (>65%) estimates do not resolve major ambiguities about death tallies and prior-year eligibility. Importantly, several forecasters note that historical fatality data in DRC are often ambiguous or just above/below eligibility\u2014raising the risk that Metaculus, when resolving, may decide the zone did not qualify or that deaths did not cross the 5,000 mark. The absence as of October of widespread recognition of a >5,000 deaths event is still significant, given how striking the indicators would be if they had. Thus, while the risk is elevated far above the long-term mean, both upside and downside uncertainties persist.

While the humanitarian response signals (prosthetics, displacement, etc.) remain very strong indicators of sharply increased violence, I am persuaded that the possibility of disqualification for either exceeding the prior-year threshold in the DRC, or undercounting/attribution ambiguity for the 2025 surge, is significant enough to warrant a downward revision. The underlying risk environment and crisis indicators remain much higher than average, and my view is still that a Yes is more likely than not, but the justified caution and resolution-specific technicalities highlighted by other experts are persuasive.",

Realist logic suggests a structurally elevated risk environment\u2014war-prone, weak state structures, and permeable borders\u2014especially in DRC. However, critiques highlight the legitimate risks of overestimating based on incomplete humanitarian signals: reporting lags, prior years' deaths perhaps sometimes exceeding 1,000, ambiguity over which 'war' counts, and post-fact Metaculus adjudication. While sympathetic to the argument that amputee/displacement stats often foreshadow high-fatality events, I recognize the contest's incentive to respect dataset ambiguity and Metaculus caution.

The most persuasive critiques of my initial, base-rate-focused forecast center on several factors: 1) the possibility that reporting lags and post-facto validation (especially in opaque theaters like DRC) could reveal 5,000+ deaths where current public data do not, 2) the argument that historical base rates are context-dependent and that the present extraordinary violence/displacement surge is meaningfully disconnected from recent median years, and 3) the risk that overly rigid application of base rates and Democratic Peace Theory can understate conflict risk in highly unstable, non-democratic regions experiencing multifaceted escalation. However, I maintain skepticism regarding the omission of hard evidence for a 5,000-death event as of October, plus the critical Metaculus eligibility test regarding deaths in both 2023 and 2024. Given these, I am persuaded by the argument for prudently raising my probability, but not to the high levels advocated by some, as too much uncertainty remains around eligibility and ultimate adjudication. Weighing the sharply elevated indicators, reporting lag, and the substantial, but not overwhelming, risk that evidence yet to be compiled will tip the final verdict, I adjust my probability upward to 28%.

The consensus in the group was that while verification and eligibility ambiguity remain non-trivial risks (especially in Congo, as per some conservative estimates), the convergence of cross-indicator signals in 2025 makes a qualifying event materially more probable than my original forecast. That said, I remain cautious in not moving all the way to the top quartile of peer forecasts due to the lingering risk that Metaculus ultimately rules the DRC escalation ineligible (due to above-threshold prior years, multi-front accounting, or ambiguous death totals).

However, other well-argued positions highlight the real risks of disqualification (due to slightly exceeding the prior year threshold, ambiguous event attribution, or deaths being spread across adjacent conflicts) and the possibility that reporting lags will delay or introduce ambiguity in resolution.

However, several critiques (and group consensus) underscore that (1) the DRC's 2023/24 annual death tolls straddled the eligibility line (i.e., not always <1,000 each year in all datasets), (2) no source has yet verified >=5,000 deaths for 2025 as of October, and (3) Metaculus\u2019s fine print and post-hoc data reconciliation can scuttle what looks like a 'clear Yes' with disqualification or ambiguity.

Critiques of the higher forecasts (70%+) and defenses of a somewhat lower band (35-45%) highlight these procedural uncertainties.

While these signals are unusually strong, the historic rarity of eligible wars crossing 5,000 deaths in a single year, combined with the demonstrable risk of Metaculus resolution ambiguity (prior-year deaths sometimes skirt the 1,000 cutoff in DRC, regional data is murky, and fatality attribution could be distributed across overlapping actors/theaters), compels a more moderate stance.

More than 7 million people have been displaced. The Shirika la Umoja orthopedic center in Goma, supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross since 2005, has seen a dramatic increase in demand for prosthetics, treating over 800 amputees and other severely injured patients since early 2025. Prosthetic production rose from 422 in all of 2024 to 326 in just the first half of 2025. The center\u2019s staff, including prosthetic technicians like Julienne Paypay\u2014who lost her own leg as a child\u2014craft limbs by hand, each individually molded and assembled. Patients like Jerome Jean Claude Amani, who lost his wife and four children in a rebel attack, and Faustin Amani, who lost both legs in a military vehicle accident, describe their journeys of trauma and resilience. Amani said, 'I don\u2019t see my prosthetic as a weakness but as a victory,' reflecting a broader narrative of survival and hope amid devastation.

It references high death tolls from drug use in the U.S. (97,231 in 2023), war casualties in Gaza (67,000 since 2023), Yemen (377,000 dead), and Ukraine (up to 1 million military and civilian deaths by 2024), while criticizing the UN for failing to act decisively. The author claims that the term 'genocide' is misused and diluted, pointing to historical oversights such as the UN's inaction during the Rwandan genocide (800,000 killed in 100 days) and the underreported violence in Venezuela (18,000 homicides in 2011), Nigeria (200 Christians killed in 2025), and Sri Lanka. The piece condemns the politicization of victimhood, accusing international actors of framing Israel as genocidal while ignoring Hamas\u2019s role in capturing Israeli civilians. It criticizes the UN\u2019s silence on global atrocities and accuses Western elites of using ideological polarization to justify violence. The author invokes Kofi Annan\u2019s 2005 UN report emphasizing that threats like terrorism, organized crime, and state violence are interconnected and that all people have a right to live without fear.

The data shows a 43% increase in protests between May and September 2025 compared to the previous five months, with 15% of all global demonstrations during this period being pro-Palestinian, occurring in 137 countries and territories. The largest concentrations of protests were in Yemen, Morocco, the United States, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, France, Italy, Spain, and Australia\u2014accounting for over 75% of the total. The vast majority of these demonstrations were peaceful, with only 1% resulting in violence. Regionally, 22,066 protests (46% of the total) occurred in the Middle East, followed by 8,298 in Europe and Central Asia (17%), 14% in Africa, 13% in the U.S. and Canada, 9% in Asia-Pacific, and 1% in Latin America and the Caribbean. ACLED attributes the surge in protests to ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza, which have led to over 67,000 Palestinian deaths according to Gaza authorities, widespread displacement, and severe humanitarian restrictions. The UN Human Rights Council\u2019s investigation concluded on September 16 that Israel committed acts of genocide in Gaza, citing at least four of the five acts defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention, including killings, severe physical and psychological harm, conditions aimed at destruction, and measures to prevent births. This conclusion was echoed by the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) on September 1. The report also notes a growing international backlash, including recognition of the State of Palestine by several Western allies of Israel\u2014such as the UK, France, Canada, and Australia\u2014drawing sharp criticism from Israel\u2019s government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the U.S. The offensive has also been marked by approximately 21,900 conflict events, second only to Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, with over 11,900 airstrikes and drone attacks. Gaza City (North) accounted for nearly 60% of Israeli military activity in September 2025, including extensive use of explosive robots\u2014over 110 since May 2024, with more than a third in Gaza City alone. ACLED reports that these robots, often repurposed armored vehicles loaded with explosives and remotely controlled, are used not only for attacks but also to intimidate civilians and force evacuations. Despite growing opposition within Israel\u2019s security apparatus, the political leadership continues to pursue a 'total victory' driven by ideological goals, aiming to degrade Hamas, block alternative Palestinian governance, and push Gaza toward uninhabitability to encourage migration and obstruct Palestinian sovereignty. Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that his government will not accept a Palestinian state, even after accepting a U.S. proposal from Donald Trump that envisions a credible path toward Palestinian self-determination and peaceful coexistence through dialogue.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:02 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-dos-anos-ofensiva-israel-contra-gaza-dejan-48000-movilizaciones-propalestinas-mundo-20251007010250.html)\n\n**Two Years of Genocide War in Gaza: Escalating Attacks on Palestinian Journalists**\nSince October 7, 2023, Palestinian journalists have faced escalating violence and systematic violations by Israeli forces and settlers, according to data from the Freedom Committee of the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate. The report documents 252 journalist fatalities in Gaza by October 2025, including 34 female journalists killed by Israeli military fire. The years 2023, 2024, and 2025 saw a sharp rise in attacks: 102 journalists killed in 2023, 91 in 2024, and 59 in early 2025. Over 1,000 journalists have been injured, with 63 in 2023, 86 in 2024, and 54 in 2025, including severe injuries such as amputations. Since the start of the conflict, 153 journalists have been arrested\u201448 in 2023, 69 in 2024, and 36 in early 2025. More than 150 media offices and institutions have been destroyed, including 90 in 2023, 30 in 2024, and 20 in 2025. Journalists have been targeted in homes, resulting in the deaths of family members, and 255 have been injured by gunfire. Settler violence increased from 27 incidents in 2023 to 36 in 2024 and 28 in early 2025. Digital threats include coordinated platform censorship by Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, X, and TikTok, often with Israeli government collaboration, involving account bans, content removal, and harassment. Over 500 journalists have been forced to flee their homes, with approximately 50 killed in shelters, schools, or tents near hospitals. The syndicate emphasized that attacks have evolved from harassment and detention to direct targeting of lives and property. It called for protective gear, emergency medical units, safe zones, psychological support, digital security training, and international legal action through the UN, the International Criminal Court, and the International Federation of Journalists. It also urged financial and technical support for independent media, emergency equipment storage, and training in conflict safety and risk management.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 09:04 PM\nSource:[Addustour newspaper (\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631)](https://www.addustour.com/articles/1522000)\n\n**War tears at heart of Congo**\nIn eastern Congo, ongoing conflict involving over 100 armed groups, including the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, has intensified since January 2025, leading to a surge in casualties and deepening one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced. The Shirika la Umoja orthopedic center in Goma, supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross since 2005, has seen a dramatic increase in demand for prosthetics, treating over 800 amputees and other severely injured patients since early 2025.

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that Israel has killed an average of more than one child per hour since the conflict began, equivalent to a full classroom of children per day. A Johns Hopkins University study published in The Lancet in December 2024 confirmed the Gaza authorities' figures as accurate, while a May 2024 Economist report concluded the numbers represent the 'lower bound' of casualties, with real figures possibly 40% higher. As of January 2025, a Lancet study estimated actual fatalities could be 40% above official reports. An Israeli military commander in August 2024 stated over 20% of Gaza\u2019s 2.2 million population\u2014more than 200,000 people\u2014were killed or injured in Israeli attacks. Over 1 million people have been internally displaced, with 1.168 million displaced as of April 2025, representing about 53% of Gaza\u2019s population. Israeli forces have destroyed 90% of Gaza\u2019s territory, and currently control 82% of the enclave. The blockade has caused a severe humanitarian crisis, with UNRWA reporting at least 1,000 deaths due to famine. More than 1,200 entire families have been wiped out in Israeli attacks. At least 543 humanitarian workers, including 370 UNRWA staff, have been killed in Israeli strikes. Over 210 Palestinian journalists have been killed, according to Reporters Without Borders, as Israel has blocked foreign journalists and independent investigators from entering Gaza. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, at least 994 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023, including 212 children, with 965 killed by Israeli soldiers and 19 by extremist settlers. Between January and September 2025, 1,384 homes and structures were demolished in the West Bank, adding to 1,768 demolitions in 2024. Peace Now and B'Tselem, two Israeli NGOs, reported that 41 Palestinian communities were expelled by settler violence supported by the Israeli military. In July 2025, they jointly accused Israel of committing genocide. The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) endorsed this view, with 86% of its 500 members supporting the conclusion. A UN-mandated independent commission concluded that Israel, particularly leaders including Benjamin Netanyahu, is committing four out of five acts of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The commission\u2019s chair, Navi Pillay, stated there is clear intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza. The report, published before the UN General Assembly in September 2025, was not binding but may inform future prosecutions at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. While the UK and France recognized Palestinian self-determination at the UN, neither labeled Israel\u2019s actions as genocide.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:36 AM\nSource:[TVI](https://tvi.iol.pt/noticias/faixa-de-gaza/israel/este-e-o-numero-inexato-de-mortos-em-dois-anos-exatos-de-guerra/20251007/68e3c969d34ee0c2fed0eee7)\n\n**The Pain Persists: Two Years After Hamas\u2019s Brutal Attack on Israel, War and Suffering Continue**\nTwo years have passed since the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered a major escalation in the Middle East conflict. The surprise assault resulted in nearly 1,200 deaths in Israel and the kidnapping of over 250 hostages. As of October 7, 2025, peace remains elusive, with ongoing suffering on both sides. Survivors continue to grapple with trauma from the massacre, and the central focus remains on hostage releases and a ceasefire to enable reconstruction. Israel\u2019s military response in the Gaza Strip has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, with over 67,000 Palestinians reported dead\u2014far exceeding the number of fatalities from the initial attack\u2014sparking global concern over civilian protection. Severe shortages of water, food, and shelter persist, with families like Iman Abdel Halim surviving in displacement tents, according to reports by Reuters and CNN. International civil society has responded with humanitarian flotillas attempting to deliver aid despite major logistical and security challenges. The conflict has fueled global polarization, with widespread protests in capitals supporting Palestinians and opposing Israeli policy. The war has also proven extremely dangerous for journalists, with more media personnel killed in this conflict than in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and Afghanistan combined, highlighting the extreme peril of reporting from the region. The only visible hope for the future is a potential peace agreement that could serve as a new roadmap to end the cycle of violence and suffering.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[TV Azteca](https://www.tvazteca.com/aztecanoticias/2-anos-ataque-hamas-israel-guerra-palestina-gaza-sufrimiento-siguen)\n\n**The World Is a Genocide: A Critique of Global Inaction and the Erosion of Human Rights**\nThe article titled 'El mundo es un genocidio' argues that global violence and systemic failures have reduced the world to a state resembling genocide. It references high death tolls from drug use in the U.S. (97,231 in 2023), war casualties in Gaza (67,000 since 2023), Yemen (377,000 dead), and Ukraine (up to 1 million military and civilian deaths by 2024), while criticizing the UN for failing to act decisively. The author claims that the term 'genocide' is misused and diluted, pointing to historical oversights such as the UN's inaction during the Rwandan genocide (800,000 killed in 100 days) and the underreported violence in Venezuela (18,000 homicides in 2011), Nigeria (200 Christians killed in 2025), and Sri Lanka. The piece condemns the politicization of victimhood, accusing international actors of framing Israel as genocidal while ignoring Hamas\u2019s role in capturing Israeli civilians. It criticizes the UN\u2019s silence on global atrocities and accuses Western elites of using ideological polarization to justify violence. The author invokes Kofi Annan\u2019s 2005 UN report emphasizing that threats like terrorism, organized crime, and state violence are interconnected and that all people have a right to live without fear. Despite the UN\u2019s 1998 resolution linking terrorism to human rights violations, the author asserts that current international law is ineffective. The article concludes by quoting UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 warning that 'the planet is on the brink,' criticizing the UN\u2019s focus on climate and gender issues while ignoring ongoing genocidal violence.

The attack, described by Hamas as a 'calculated gamble,' evolved into a protracted and devastating war, resulting in approximately 60,000 Palestinian deaths, hundreds of thousands of injuries, and near-total destruction of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure. While the conflict recentered the Palestinian issue on the global stage and exposed the limits of normalization with occupation, Hamas has suffered significant losses, including the erosion of its leadership and organizational capacity due to sustained Israeli bombing and blockade\u2014conditions some describe as genocide. By the end of the second year, Hamas accepted a U.S. presidential plan proposed by Donald Trump, involving disarmament, release of remaining hostages, and the establishment of an interim administration in Gaza, signaling a shift from seeking military victory to seeking a viable exit from the crisis. The war\u2019s impact extended beyond Gaza, spreading to Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, with direct Israeli strikes on Iran and a major realignment of regional power structures. The conflict has rewritten the regional map through violence and destruction. The article reflects on the broader political and humanitarian tragedy, questioning whether the immense cost was justified. It argues that political movements must be judged not by slogans or battlefield gains, but by their ability to build state institutions and serve their people. The true test of any movement is its capacity to govern and improve lives\u2014transforming Gaza from a battleground for factions into a space for citizens. For Israel, the lesson is that military force alone cannot extinguish the Palestinian national identity or end resistance, as demonstrated by the enduring symbolism of October 6. The central lesson is that lasting peace requires political vision, state-building, and a commitment to human dignity over perpetual conflict.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:17 PM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/3568269)\n\n**Global Pro-Palestinian Protests Surge Amid Escalating Gaza Conflict, UN Finds Genocide Evidence**\nAccording to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), nearly 48,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrations have taken place globally over the past two years since Israel's offensive in Gaza began on October 7, 2023.

M23\u2019s military coordinator, Sultani Makenga, accused President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi of destroying the country and called for the overthrow of his regime, promising a 'rapid liberation' of the nation. At Rumangabo, coordinator Bertrand Bisimwa declared the 'revolution' had reached its decisive phase, framing the movement\u2019s armed struggle as a quest for accountable governance. On September 19, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres released a report detailing severe abuses by the M23 and allies, including the arbitrary arrest of at least 1,454 people, forced recruitment into training camps, destruction of civilian property, and the massacre of 335 civilians between July 9 and 28. On October 4, President Tshisekedi addressed youth in M23-occupied territories, praising their courage and promising liberation and post-conflict reconstruction. The Washington follow-up committee met on October 1, confirming the resumption of peace talks in Doha starting October 6, with an agreement reached on a prisoner exchange mechanism involving the ICRC, and goals to neutralize the FDLR and withdraw Rwandan forces.

This represents a significant increase from previous years, with 11 conflicts reaching the level of war. Analysts define 'war' as a conflict resulting in at least 1,000 deaths per year. The number of wars in 2024 is the highest since 2016. Despite the increase in conflicts and wars, the total number of deaths in 2024 decreased slightly. Estimates suggest that around 160,000 people died as a result of conflicts in 2024. 'We see more wars and conflicts than before, but fewer people are dying than in the extremely violent year of 2022. 2024 was the fourth most violent year since the Rwandan genocide in 1994,' says co-author Sean Davis. The war in Ukraine remains the deadliest conflict in the world, with an estimated 76,000 deaths in 2024. 'It's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between civilians and members of armed groups, although the information situation has improved in many areas over the past 15 years. This is particularly challenging in situations where the distinction between civilians and combatants is blurred,' says co-author Theresa Pettersson. In 2024, there was a significant increase in cases of violence directed against civilians. The program recorded 13,900 cases of civilian deaths as a result of targeted attacks, a 31% increase from the previous year. The Islamic State (IS) terrorist group remains the deadliest, responsible for the deaths of around 3,800 civilians, mostly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since 2010, the number of conflicts involving states has nearly doubled, and the total number of deaths has increased fivefold. The 2024 statistics will be published in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Peace Research.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[newsru.co.il](https://www.newsru.co.il/science_hitech/16jun2025/conflict_vg.html)\n\n**UCDP: 61 Armed Conflicts in 2024, Record High Since 1946**\nAccording to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), there were 61 armed conflicts involving states in 2024, a record high since 1946.

A total of 61 armed conflicts were recorded, with 11 escalating into full-scale wars. This is the highest number of conflicts since the post-war period. According to Sean Davis, senior analyst at the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, '2024 was the fourth most violent year since 1994, when the Rwandan genocide occurred.' The study highlights major conflicts including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israeli strikes on Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, armed clashes in Nigeria, and fighting in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Researchers also noted an increase in armed conflicts over the past few years, with 56 recorded in 2022 and 59 in 2023. There are also reports that several European countries, including the UK, France, and some Nordic countries, are considering sending tens of thousands of troops to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, while Germany and other EU countries are opposed to this, fearing it could escalate the situation.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/prio-zafiksiroval-rekordnyj-uroven-mezhgosudarstvennyh-vojn-v-2024-641829.html)\n\n**Record Number of Inter-State Conflicts in 2024, Study Finds**\nAccording to a study by researchers from Uppsala University, Sweden, published in The Times on June 11, 2024, there were 61 inter-state conflicts recorded in 2024, the highest number since the end of World War II. Of these, 11 escalated into full-scale wars, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,000 people. The list includes the Russian-Ukrainian war, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon, battles against terrorist groups in Nigeria, and renewed violence in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. The researchers note that the number of conflicts is increasing, with 56 in 2022 and 59 in 2023. 2024 was the fourth most violent year since 1994, when the Rwandan genocide occurred, with approximately 160,000 people killed in organized violence last year. The study also highlights the rise in attacks on civilians, with 13,900 targeted killings of non-combatants in 2024, a 31% increase from 2023. The Islamic State (IS) was the leading perpetrator of such attacks, responsible for over 3,800 victims, mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 'We're seeing more wars and conflicts than before, although with slightly fewer casualties than in the particularly bloody 2022 year,' said Shon Davis, an analyst with the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:03 PM\nSource:[24.kg](https://24.kg/obschestvo/332377_v2024_godu_vmire_zafiksirovano_rekordnoe_chislo_mejgosudarstvennyih_konfliktov/)\n\n**2024 Sees Highest Number of Armed Conflicts Since World War II**\nThe year 2024 has seen the highest number of armed conflicts since World War II, according to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). The program reported 61 'state conflicts', with 11 escalating into full-scale wars resulting in over 1,000 deaths. Experts note that civilians are increasingly becoming targeted and not just collateral damage. The number of civilian casualties in attacks has risen by 31% to 13,900 in 2024, with the Islamic State's activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo being the main cause. The current level of violence is the fourth largest since 1994, the year of the Rwandan genocide. In total, nearly 160,000 people died as a result of organized violence in 2023, with the war in Ukraine being the deadliest conflict, resulting in almost 76,000 deaths. UCDP also warns of an increase in inter-state conflicts and cases of countries supporting armed groups outside their territory, creating a 'dangerous dynamic' that may lead to more casualties. As previously reported, Russia launched seven rockets and 315 drones at Ukraine on June 10, with most targeting Kiev. Ukraine's air defense systems shot down all the rockets and 277 drones. A woman was killed and the Svyato-Uspensky Cathedral in Kiev was damaged as a result of the attack.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442.net](https://korrespondent.net/world/4789591-eksperty-nazvaly-2024-hod-samym-konflyktnym-so-vremen-vtoroi-myrovoi)\n\n**2024 Year Marked as Most Conflict-Ridden Since World War II**\nThe world has reached a new record for the number of armed conflicts since World War II, with 61 'state conflicts' reported in 2024, according to The Times, citing information from the Swedish project Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP).

The war in Ukraine remains the most deadly, with over 76,000 people killed in combat, the highest number among all modern wars. Ukraine's theater of conflict surpasses conflicts in the Middle East and Africa in terms of casualties. A total of around 160,000 people died from organized violence in 2024, making it the fourth deadliest year since the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and the second most active year after 2022. The situation is particularly concerning for civilians, with at least 13,900 civilians intentionally killed, a 31% increase from 2023. In some conflicts, such as the Gaza Strip, civilians make up to 98% of all casualties. 'We are seeing a rapid increase in inter-state conflicts and cases where governments support armed groups outside their territory,' said UCDP senior analyst Sean Davis. He noted that this trend exacerbates the number of civilian casualties. It is worth noting that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, making it the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II. According to international analysts, over 76,000 people died in combat in 2024 alone. The total number of deaths, including both military and civilian casualties, is already in the hundreds of thousands. The war has resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure, deportations, torture, attacks on residential areas, and massive losses among the civilian population, making it one of the most documented conflicts of the 21st century. Destroyed cities, millions of refugees, and the constant threat of nuclear escalation are the harsh realities of this war.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 08:05 AM\nSource:[\"Insan Haqlar\u0131 U\u011frunda\" \u0130ctimai Birlik](https://haqqin.az/news/350904)\n\n**2024 Saw Record Number of Conflicts Since World War II, Ukraine's War Tops the List**\nAccording to a new study by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), 2024 was the most unstable year in terms of the number of armed conflicts since 1945.

The war between Russia and Ukraine was the deadliest conflict of the year, with over 76,000 deaths in combat, the highest number of any war in the world. Ukraine's theater of war has the highest mortality rate, surpassing conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. The total number of deaths from 'organized violence' in 2024 was around 160,000, making it the fourth deadliest year since the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and the second most active year after 2022.

In some conflicts, such as the Gaza Strip, civilians make up to 98% of the dead. 'We are seeing a rapid increase in interstate conflicts and situations where governments support armed groups outside their own country,' said UCDP's senior analyst, Sean Davis. He notes that this is a 'disturbing trend' that contributes to the growing number of victims among the civilian population. 'It is a war that has caused immense destruction, displacement, torture, and massive losses among the civilian population,' said Sean Davis.

    "summary": "Experts broadly agree that the global environment in 2025 is experiencing record-high levels of armed conflicts, but the majority of mass-fatality wars (Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, Yemen) are excluded from this question due to the requirement that eligible conflicts must have had fewer than 1,000 deaths in each of 2023 and 2024 and then escalate to at least 5,000 deaths in 2025. Nearly all forecasts identify the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)\u2014specifically, intensified fighting between M23 rebels, Rwandan-backed forces, and the Congolese military in eastern DRC\u2014as the leading candidate for a qualifying escalation, noting dramatic increases in violence, displacement (7 million+), and severe injuries (surge in prosthesis demand). However, the main uncertainty is whether prior-year deaths in DRC were below the threshold and if the 2025 toll will be credibly confirmed above 5,000. Most other potential flashpoints (Sudan, Cameroon, Venezuela, Yemen, etc.) are either ineligible due to previous high death tolls or lack clear evidence of mass-casualty escalation so far.\n\nForecast probabilities vary: Military and humanitarian experts with an eye toward escalation dynamics and recent news signal high to very high probabilities (ranging from ~68% to 87%), arguing that the DRC events and the high conflict base rate make a qualifying mass-fatality event more likely than not. Security studies, ethnic conflict, and offense-defense perspectives also see DRC as a plausible candidate, with moderately high probabilities (68%\u201376%). In contrast, forecasters emphasizing base rates, democratic peace theory, or stricter conflict coding are more skeptical, with probabilities from 13% to 40%, arguing that sudden spikes exceeding 5,000 deaths post\u2013two quiet years remain rare and, as of October, no conflict has been widely reported to have crossed the threshold.\n\nCommon threads across all perspectives are: (1) the DRC is the standout case; (2) reporting/verification lag and ambiguity, especially in Africa, could delay or complicate resolution; (3) a fat-tailed risk exists for late-year surprises or information emerging that tips the outcome; and (4) the upward trend in global conflict and state-on-state violence slightly increases the base risk for qualifying escalations compared to past decades.\n\nIn summary, there is a split but modestly bullish consensus: most experts highlight eastern DRC as an unusually strong candidate for a lethal escalation to over 5,000 deaths in 2025, making a 'Yes' outcome substantially more likely this year than in most prior years, though uncertainty and data ambiguities remain significant. Forecasts cluster at 32\u201376% (median near 40\u201368%), with high-end outliers above 80% and low-end outliers near 13%\u2014all hinging primarily on the escalation and death toll in eastern Congo.",
