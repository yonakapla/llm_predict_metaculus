SEC and press disclosures show no signs of revived negotiations or deal machinery. Further, all major competitors have said they will not acquire Spirit, and instead are capturing its market share organically. Antitrust precedent is strongly against such a merger, with judicial and DOJ opposition specifically addressing this deal just over a year ago, and no policy shift visible. As a result, even with bankruptcy presenting some theoretical pathway to acquisition, the timelines and deal protocols make any JetBlue-Spirit acquisition announcement by the deadline virtually impossible.

Industry rivals are moving in to capture Spirit's market, rather than bidding. Key new facts: JetBlue and United have inked a new partnership ('Blue Sky'), suggesting JetBlue is moving on from speculative M&A toward alliances and organic routes. There is zero sign of a live or proposed acquisition bid from JetBlue, and Hostile U.S. antitrust enforcement persists; even if the White House shifted, courts would still need to be convinced after the high-profile block. No evidence in reporting or regulatory filings indicate surprise movement on revising or reviving a JetBlue-Spirit M&A.

On top of that, the practical mechanics of reinitiating negotiations, conducting due diligence for an asset whose value is deteriorating and where routes, slots, and crews are being shed, combined with the necessity for bankruptcy court approval and new regulatory review, are insurmountable within the remaining timeframe. The 8% probability implies a material chance of a reversal not supported by legal precedent, news flow, or procedural realities.

They appropriately weight the base rate for blocked mergers being revived and closed (which is vanishingly small), demonstrate clear awareness of the current actions (or lack thereof) by both parties, and correctly anticipate that Spirit\u2019s distress is far more likely to yield piecemeal asset divestiture rather than a wholesale sale to JetBlue.

Their analysis of workflows\u2014regulatory, legal, and strategic\u2014is highly consistent with the findings of a Porter Five Forces analysis, particularly the force of government/regulatory barriers to entry/consolidation. The likelihood of a sudden turnaround in both regulatory attitude and deal mechanics in the last months of 2025 is near-zero, further reinforced by current operational strategies (downscaling, asset selling, pivot to alliances). The clear, multifactor approach in their argument justifies the extremely low probability assigned and aligns with industry rivalry outcomes and the unlikelihood of value creation via a last-minute acquisition scenario."

Furthermore, the assertion that rivals are expanding organically rather than pursuing troubled merger/buyout opportunities is a strong business indicator against full-scale acquisition scenarios.

By emphasizing that the obstacles to deal closure are compounding (ongoing regulatory hostility, succession of bankruptcies, rivals' predatory market behavior, and lack of corporate movement toward M&A), they effectively demonstrate why the probability should be at the practical minimum absent a written, formal termination notice. Their evaluation is appropriately conservative, rooted in empirical data and accurately reflects the persistent antitrust impediments.

Considering the advanced state of Spirit's bankruptcy proceedings, absence of signaling from either management about revisiting the deal, JetBlue's pivot toward United, and the normal timeline for reinitiating and closing a deal (which is itself longer than the time remaining), a 1-2% probability, in line with both legal precedent and industry base rates, would be more accurate and defensible."

While I would calibrate the tail risk closer to 2% than 8%, their recognition that only an extraordinary legal or political shift could enable such a transaction preserves logical consistency.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn July 28, 2022, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1158463/000119312522204208/d319514dex991.htm) that their boards of directors had approved a merger between the two companies through which JetBlue would acquire Spirit for $33.50 a share, at an enterprise value of $7.6 billion, and following the merger would eventually operate as a single airline under the JetBlue name and be the 5th largest airline in the United States. The airlines [planned](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/business/jetblue-spirit-merger.html) to complete the transaction in the first half of 2024.  On October 19, 2022 Spirit's shareholders [approved](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1498710/000149871022000336/a221019stockholderapprov.htm) the deal. \n\nOn March 7, 2023, the US Department of Justice [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-jetblue-s-proposed-acquisition-spirit) an antitrust lawsuit to block the acquisition on the grounds that it would harm consumers by eliminating an ultra-low-cost carrier, which would result in, according to the DOJ, \"raising costs for the flying public and harming cost-conscious fliers most acutely.\" JetBlue and Spirit [announced](https://investor.jetblue.com/news/news-details/2023/JetBlue-and-Spirit-Will-Continue-to-Advance-Plan-to-Create-Compelling-National-Low-Fare-Challenger-to-the-Dominant-U.S.-Carriers/default.aspx) that they would \"vigorously defend\"  against the DOJ's suit, arguing that the post-merger JetBlue would be a stronger and more competitive airline against the legacy carriers.\n\nAccording to [research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/done-deal-why-many-large-transactions-fail-to-cross-the-finish-line) by McKinsey, in any given year about 10% of large M&A transactions are cancelled, with larger combinations being more likely to be cancelled. The 2nd most common reason for mergers to be terminated is for regulatory or antitrust concerns.

Chief Executive Dave Davis explained that the changes aim to 'optimize' the carrier\u2019s network by concentrating on stronger markets, but acknowledged that the evaluations will inevitably affect staffing levels, with union leaders to be consulted in the coming weeks. The move follows earlier capacity reductions from March to June and follows the airline\u2019s exit from its first bankruptcy.

Financially, the airline reported a $257\u202fmillion loss for the March\u2011June period, amid higher operating costs, softer U.S. travel demand, and increased competition, especially after a failed merger with JetBlue Airways.

United has begun operating new flights in markets where Spirit previously flew, giving customers alternatives if Spirit ceases service.  In late August\u202f2025, Frontier Airlines announced a similar strategy, adding 20 new routes in former Spirit markets; Deutsche Bank analysts said Frontier profited from Spirit's bankruptcy.  Both United and Frontier face challenges from customer preference for premium options, an oversupply of domestic flights, and rising labor costs.

Earlier in September, the airline cut 11 routes and cancelled a 12th; United, Frontier and JetBlue have launched new services to attract Spirit passengers. The American Federation of Airworkers said the latest bankruptcy poses greater challenges than the first. Spirit has historically relied on high\u2011density seating and low operating costs.

DOT cited concerns that the partnership violated the U.S.\u2013Mexico 'open skies' agreement by limiting access to Mexico City\u2019s airport.  The decision follows a tentative non\u2011renewal in January\u202f2024 and formally sets an official end date for the collaboration.  The joint venture had allowed the two SkyTeam carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing and revenue sharing as if they were a single airline, offering reciprocal frequent\u2011flyer benefits and seamless transfers for passengers traveling between the United States and Mexico.  With the partnership dissolved, passengers may face longer connection times and fewer flight options, and fares could vary depending on which carrier sells the ticket.  Delta\u2019s spokesperson said, 'We are disappointed that the Department of Transportation has chosen to terminate its approval of the strategic and pro\u2011competitive partnership between Delta and Aeromexico, a decision that will cause significant harm to U.S. jobs, communities and consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico.'

The warning follows Spirit\u2019s Chapter\u202f11 bankruptcy filing in November\u202f2024 and its emergence on March\u202f13,\u202f2025, after a debt\u2011restructuring plan that projected a consolidated net profit of $252\u202fmillion for 2025. The airline has also been hit by a decline in U.S. travel demand after February\u202f2025 tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which, combined with rising inflation, led to cancellations and a flat profit outlook for U.S. majors. Spirit\u2019s stock price fell 47\u202f% on the day the JetBlue acquisition lawsuit was decided. The carrier is reportedly considering selling spare engines or gate rights to raise cash in the short\u2011to\u2011medium term.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 12, 2025 11:46 AM\nSource:[aerotime.aero](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/spirit-airlines-warning-investors-finances)\n\n**JetBlue, United partnership gets go-ahead from U.S. Transportation...**\nJetBlue and United Airlines have received approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation to proceed with their partnership, dubbed 'Blue Sky', which will allow travelers to book flights on both carriers' websites and earn points in their frequent flyer programs.

JetBlue and United plan to introduce new customer benefits starting in fall 2025, with the partnership set to begin in 2027. This approval marks a shift in the U.S. transportation body's approach to corporate deals, with antitrust officials under the Trump administration taking a more lenient stance.

The partnership, which would have allowed the two airlines to coordinate flights and share revenue, was terminated after the lower court ruling. American Airlines expressed disappointment with the decision, arguing that it unfairly annulled a joint venture and demonstrated a hostile stance towards business cooperation. According to American Airlines, the 'Northeast Alliance' would have increased competition and expanded customer options in the Northeast. However, the US Department of Justice, under the Biden administration, argued that the partnership would harm consumers by eliminating incentives for American Airlines to lower prices to attract customers from Jetblue, a competing airline with often lower fares. A Boston district court ruled in favor of the Department of Justice in 2023, finding that the partnership violated antitrust law. As a result, Jetblue ended the partnership to pursue the acquisition of Spirit Airlines, which was also challenged by the Department of Justice under Biden.\nOriginal language: eo\nPublish date: July 01, 2025 11:16 AM\nSource:[airliners.de](https://www.airliners.de/us-gerichtshof-bestaetigt-verbot-allianz-american-jetblue/81653)\n\n**JetBlue to Suspend Flights from Miami International Airport**\nJetBlue Airways, a major low-cost airline in the United States, has announced that it will suspend all flights from the Miami International Airport (MIA) starting from September 3, 2025. This decision comes after years of economic losses and a complex landscape for the aviation sector following the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Derek Dombrowski, JetBlue's Director of Corporate Communications, 'This measure responds to a consolidation strategy to focus resources on more profitable routes.' The airline had operated up to 14 daily flights to MIA, but its presence has been reduced to one or two daily flights between Miami and Boston. JetBlue has reported significant losses, including a net loss of $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $208 million in the first quarter of 2025. The airline's attempt to expand through a merger with Spirit Airlines was also blocked by the US government due to antitrust concerns. Passengers with flights scheduled from or to MIA after September 3 will have two options: 'We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible experience, and we will continue to operate from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL), where we have a strong presence,' said a JetBlue spokesperson.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 25, 2025 02:05 AM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/respuestas/us/esta-famosa-aerolinea-le-dice-adios-al-aeropuerto-de-miami-lo-que-pasara-desde-el-3-de-septiembre-estados-unidos-nnda-nnlt-noticia/)\n\n**United Airlines and JetBlue Launch 'Blue Sky' Partnership**\nUnited Airlines and JetBlue Airways have announced a strategic partnership called 'Blue Sky' to offer passengers greater flexibility in booking and access to a wider network. This collaboration allows travelers to book flights on both airlines' websites and accumulate or redeem loyalty points interchangeably. Subject to regulatory approval, some aspects of the partnership may begin as early as autumn 2025. United Airlines will have up to seven daily slots at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) starting from 2027, marking its return to JFK after leaving in 2022. JetBlue will receive additional time slots at Newark Liberty International Airport, strengthening its presence at United's East Coast hub. United Airlines' CEO, Scott Kirby, has described the move as a mistake. The airline briefly returned to JFK in 2021 due to a decrease in traffic at the airport caused by COVID-19. United had to leave JFK in 2022 because it was unable to secure long-term slot allocations. The partnership highlights the integration of loyalty programs, allowing members of United's MileagePlus and JetBlue's TrueBlue to accumulate and redeem points on both airlines. Passengers with elite status can enjoy reciprocal benefits, including upgrades and flexibility in changing flights. The loyalty programs of airlines are becoming increasingly important revenue streams. During the COVID-19 pandemic, US airlines used these programs to generate revenue and raise funds. In 2023, United Airlines' loyalty program revenue reached $3.49 billion, a 10% increase from the previous year. The airline will increase lounge access fees to $1,400 starting from March 2025. Both airlines will maintain independent control over their flight operations, including schedules and prices. This approach distinguishes the 'Blue Sky' alliance from JetBlue's previous Northeast Alliance with American Airlines, which was dissolved in 2023 due to antitrust concerns. This is not the only setback United Airlines has faced regarding a collaboration. In 2024, a US federal judge blocked United Airlines' proposal to acquire low-cost carrier Spirit, citing that the deal would remove a low-cost carrier from the market. The implications of this partnership are strategic for both airlines. For United Airlines, it facilitates a strategic return to JFK, resolving previous operational issues at Newark and expanding its presence in the competitive New York market. JetBlue, on the other hand, gains greater access to Newark, aligning with its focus on leisure travel on the East Coast and efforts to overcome post-pandemic profitability challenges. In the last nine quarters, JetBlue has reported a profit only in two of them. The 'Blue Sky' alliance represents a significant step towards improving passenger comfort and expanding network connectivity for both United Airlines and JetBlue. While the partnership awaits regulatory approval, travelers can expect a more integrated and flexible flying experience in the future.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 01:18 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/it/notizie/2025/05/29/united-airlines-e-jetblue-lanciano-la-collaborazione-blue-sky/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of JetBlue announcing that it has acquired Spirit Airlines before 2026 is extremely low\u2014predictions range from 1% to 8%. The overarching consensus is rooted in several recurring themes:\n\n- The original merger was definitively blocked on antitrust grounds by the DOJ and a federal judge in early 2024; since then, there has been no regulatory reversal or legal development suggesting this could be undone in time.\n- JetBlue has formally abandoned the proposed acquisition and has shifted its strategic focus toward partnerships (notably with United via the 'Blue Sky' venture), further signaling a lack of intent to revive the Spirit deal.\n- Spirit Airlines' financial distress\u2014involving multiple bankruptcies and severe operational contractions\u2014does make asset sales or some form of liquidation likely, but not an outright acquisition by JetBlue, mainly due to persistent regulatory barriers and the complexity of securing court, regulatory, and bankruptcy approvals within the tight deadline.\n- No other major airlines are interested in acquiring Spirit in its entirety (United and Frontier explicitly declined), with competitors instead absorbing Spirit's market share through expanded services.\n- The historical base rate for large, blocked airline mergers being reversed and completed within a compressed timeframe is nearly zero.\n- Any 'Yes' scenario described by experts involves an extreme black swan event: a sudden, dramatic regulatory reversal or a bankruptcy-triggered 'failing firm' defense compelling approval, all executed within an unusually fast timeline\u2014possibilities the experts uniformly characterize as highly implausible given present industry signals and legal norms.\n\nIn summary, the combined expert forecast is that the probability of JetBlue announcing an acquisition of Spirit Airlines before 2026 is essentially negligible, with the tail risk only fractionally above zero to account for truly extraordinary, unforeseen developments.",
