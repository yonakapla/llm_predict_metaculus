The event is framed as recognition of 'peace through football and international leadership,' despite or even leveraging the controversy. There may be attempts to dilute criticism by making the award a multi-recipient honor (e.g., co-winning with a famous footballer or activist), but with Trump the headline honoree.

The preponderance of reporting, Infantino's comments, and the event planning underscore the political payoff. While there is meaningful reputational risk for FIFA and active investigations could, in theory, prompt a last-minute shift, the historical base rate for FIFA reversing such decisions under scandal is low\u2014especially with Infantino personally invested. Minimal ambiguity in decision-makers\u2019 public signals and the alignment of event, location, and purpose create a strong expectation of Trump\u2019s selection. Given my expertise, I assess the risk of reversal or surprise as minor but non-negligible (e.g., ~10-12%). Therefore, I assign a very high but not absolute probability.",

The degree of publicized speculation, including direct quotes and leaks (e.g., Infantino\u2019s on-the-record advocacy, the timing after a Nobel snub, absence of any alternative candidates, and Trump\u2019s outsized role in the event), is highly atypical unless the outcome is already substantially decided. While the backlash and Senate investigation create a non-zero risk for a last-minute reversal, FIFA has a long track record of political resilience and reputation for weathering controversy. The biggest uncertainty would be internal FIFA board revolt or emergent new scandal in the immediate days before the ceremony\u2014a possibility, but not the base expectation given current reporting and historic patterns. Thus, the probability that Trump wins the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize is extremely high, but not fully certain due to potential late-stage political calculation shifts.",

The newness of the award (no base rate), lack of transparent process, and strong circumstantial evidence all point toward a strong intent to give Trump this prize\u2014particularly as a form of symbolic compensation after being passed over for the Nobel, and as mutual back-scratching for the Kennedy Center and World Cup hosting. HOWEVER, two strong countervailing risks weigh against certainty: 1) the scale of the backlash, ethical probes, and potential for sponsor revolt and international embarrassment; 2) FIFA\u2019s tradition of last-minute narrative pivots and the possibility of sharing/deferring the award to absorb criticism. Balancing these, and given extremely high media and political signaling, I assess that the chance is substantially above 50%, but not extreme, as true certainty is lacking in an evolving crisis with high reputational risk for all parties.",

However, the level of political and public blowback\u2014evident in a Senate probe, consistent media criticism, and allegations of misuse of non-profit status\u2014makes it possible that either Infantino or the wider FIFA leadership will rethink such a high-profile move or dilute it at the last instance. No strong indications have emerged of any organized internal resistance within FIFA that has successfully derailed such plans in the past, nor is there a historical precedent for Infantino backing down under external pressure. The risk that sponsors or the U.S. soccer establishment could intervene is real, but at this late stage, the event looks too personalized and stage-managed to derail. The base rate of FIFA making such a politicized award is essentially zero, but nearly all circumstantial evidence points in the direction that if it was ever going to happen, this is the context\u2014even judging by FIFA and Infantino's chequered ethical track record. Therefore, base rates argue for caution, but the convergence of extraordinary personal, organizational, and event circumstances makes a Yes outcome more likely than not.

The absence of any leak or pushback from within FIFA suggests the decision is likely made, or at least that alternatives are marginalized. However, elite organizations have in rare cases changed course at the last moment due to external pressure: if the PR/legitimacy cost calculation flips between now and December 5, a non-Trump awardee is possible. Given all factors, the base rate for overtly political sports-prizes awarded to sitting leaders is very low, but the tailored context here (Infantino-Trump-FIFA, venue, prize creation) justifies a high, but not certain, probability.

When organizations hit the wall of legitimacy collapse (think IOC's Salt Lake scandal, or FIFA's own 2015 implosion), reversals do happen\u2014especially if the scandal becomes existential or sponsors rebel. Your dismissal of reputational risk as irrelevant ignores that even authoritarian-leaning, elite-driven international bodies have red lines, and the current US political/media system is uniquely skilled at imposing reputational and financial costs. Furthermore, you overestimate Infantino's autonomy: FIFA's exco, sponsors, and federation interests retain a contingency veto if Trump-award optics were to imperil commercial deals or 2026 tournament branding. Forecast extremism for its own sake is risky\u2014after all, if every social fact says norms are dead, why hasn't the prize already been formally announced? Even in exceptional spaces, social construction means countervailing pressure matters, and my 70% accounts for both the tailored Trump-favoritism AND the remaining, very real risk of backlash derailing a too-obvious political stunt."

The problem is you treat FIFA as a rational actor in the brand sense, like Nike or the IOC, highly sensitive to mainstream reputational harm. In reality, FIFA's risk appetite is closer to a petrostate dictatorship than a Fortune 500 brand\u2014they survive repeated systemic scandals because their power, revenue streams, and leadership selection are insulated by deeply entrenched patronage and political alliances. Infantino isn't just PR-managing; he's performing a transaction in broad daylight, knowing full well the blowback is already priced in\u2014a trade-off for symbolic dominance at the World Cup's US launch and solidifying the Trump-FIFA alliance. When FIFA shovels up scandals of this size, their 'crisis management' is to ride out the news cycle, not to reverse or mitigate. Thinking anything but a truly late-stage, existential shock (which is absent from all the reporting) will interrupt that trajectory is to misunderstand the organization's institutional DNA. This is reputation management by audacious, engineered spectacle, not careful retreat."

There is still a slim chance of a last-minute reversal due to unforeseen sponsor/board revolt or scandal (so 100% remains unjustified), but the aggregation of institutional signals, the prize's apparent creation as a Trump consolation, and the essentially unchecked autonomy of Infantino and his executive make this outcome all but inevitable.

While my initial caution regarding reputational risk and multi-stakeholder interests (e.g., sponsors, exco, federations) is not without merit, in this specific, highly personalized and controlled context, the risk of a late-stage reversal is likely lower than I first judged.

My own expertise in reputation management aligns with these arguments; on review, my Phase 1 estimate slightly underestimated the strength and overt nature of the elite pact (Infantino-Trump) and overestimated the likelihood of last-minute risk-avoidant behavior by FIFA.

The FIFA World Cup draw will take place in Washington, D.C., USA, on Friday, December 5, 2025. The event will be hosted at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a prominent cultural venue designed by architect Edward Durell Stone, located along the Potomac River. The center, which includes the 2,400-seat Concert Hall, the 2,400-seat Opera House, and the 1,100-seat Eisenhower Theater, will be fully taken over by FIFA from November 24 to December 12, 2025. According to the Associated Press, the Kennedy Center will receive $7.4 million (approximately 85.1 million Norwegian kroner) for hosting the draw. Additionally, FIFA will donate $2.4 million to the center and provide separate sponsorship deals worth an extra $5 million, as confirmed by Roma Daravi, the center\u2019s communications director. During the event, FIFA is expected to award a new peace prize, widely speculated to be given to U.S. President Donald Trump. This has sparked criticism, with Rutgers University professor Ross Baker calling it 'a form of bribery and flattery,' and accusing FIFA of creating a 'fake peace prize' to boost Trump\u2019s ego, calling the act 'shameful.' FIFA President Gianni Infantino has maintained a close relationship with Trump, including opening an office in Trump Tower, attending events with Trump such as the Club World Cup final, and meeting with him in the Oval Office, where Trump held the iconic World Cup trophy.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 01:48 PM\nSource:[dagbladet.no](https://www.dagbladet.no/sport/mottar-85-millioner-kroner/83893410)\n\n**After Visiting White House, Ronaldo Gets Suspension Cut By FIFA**\nCristiano Ronaldo received a reduced suspension from FIFA after being given a three-game ban for a violent conduct red card on November 13, 2024, during Portugal\u2019s 2-0 loss to the Republic of Ireland. FIFA reduced the suspension by two matches, citing Article 27 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, which allows for the remaining two games to be suspended under a one-year probation period. If Ronaldo commits another offense of similar nature and gravity during this period, the suspension will be automatically reinstated and must be served immediately at the next official match. Ronaldo had already served one match, Portugal\u2019s final qualifier against Armenia, a 9-1 win. The suspension reduction followed Ronaldo\u2019s visit to the White House on November 19, 2024, where he met with President Donald Trump, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other business leaders.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., is at the center of a political and ethical controversy over its zero-dollar rental agreement with FIFA for hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw on November 6, 2025. According to documents obtained by the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, FIFA used the Center\u2019s concert hall and major facilities from November 24 to December 12, 2025, without paying any rental fee. In exchange, FIFA reportedly provided a $7.4 million donation or sponsorship, though the exact structure and rationale for this arrangement remain undisclosed. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the deal, stating that the Center\u2019s decision to forgo millions in revenue and reduce arts programs constitutes serious mismanagement and violates its statutory mission as a national arts institution. Whitehouse demanded full documentation\u2014including the justification for the donation-based model, whether existing performances were canceled or rescheduled, and whether the Center\u2019s board approved the agreement\u2014by December 4, 2025. The Kennedy Center, led by CEO Rick Greene, dismissed the criticism as a 'political attack,' asserting that FIFA covered all costs and that comparing the arrangement solely to rental fees reflects a misunderstanding of the Center\u2019s operational model. However, the Center has not released the specific financial or legal basis for the donation structure. The controversy is further fueled by the Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of the Center\u2019s board earlier in 2025, with former President Donald Trump claiming to have 'taken control' of the institution and actively promoting conservative events. The World Cup draw was reportedly secured through Trump\u2019s recommendation, and there are unconfirmed reports that FIFA plans to award Trump its newly created 'Peace Award' during the event. The close relationship between FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Trump\u2014longstanding personal ties and public collaboration on international events\u2014has intensified scrutiny. FIFA has even established an office in Trump Tower, further signaling a deepening alliance.

The FIFA World Cup draw will take place in Washington, D.C., USA, on Friday, December 5, 2025. The event will be hosted at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a prominent cultural venue designed by architect Edward Durell Stone, located along the Potomac River. The center, which includes the 2,400-seat Concert Hall, the 2,400-seat Opera House, and the 1,100-seat Eisenhower Theater, will be fully taken over by FIFA from November 24 to December 12, 2025. According to the Associated Press, the Kennedy Center will receive $7.4 million (approximately 85.1 million Norwegian kroner) for hosting the draw. Additionally, FIFA will donate $2.4 million to the center and provide separate sponsorship deals worth an extra $5 million, as confirmed by Roma Daravi, the center\u2019s communications director. During the event, FIFA is expected to award a new peace prize, widely speculated to be given to U.S. President Donald Trump. This has sparked criticism, with Rutgers University professor Ross Baker calling it 'a form of bribery and flattery,' and accusing FIFA of creating a 'fake peace prize' to boost Trump\u2019s ego, calling the act 'shameful.' FIFA President Gianni Infantino has maintained a close relationship with Trump, including opening an office in Trump Tower, attending events with Trump such as the Club World Cup final, and meeting with him in the Oval Office, where Trump held the iconic World Cup trophy.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 01:48 PM\nSource:[dagbladet.no](https://www.dagbladet.no/sport/mottar-85-millioner-kroner/83893410)\n\n**'FIFA's leniency toward Ronaldo' crosses the line, critics say**\nFIFA has sparked controversy by suspending the full disciplinary action against Cristiano Ronaldo (40, Portugal), who received his first red card in 226 A-international matches after striking an opponent with his elbow during a World Cup European qualifier against Ireland on November 13. The incident, confirmed via VAR, led to a red card, and under FIFA regulations, elbow strikes are classified as violent conduct, typically resulting in a three-match ban. However, FIFA announced on November 26 that the incident did not constitute 'serious violence' and that the remaining suspension would be deferred\u2014enforcing it only if Ronaldo commits a similar offense within the next year. This decision allows Ronaldo to participate in the next World Cup's opening match in 2026. The move has drawn criticism, particularly due to Ronaldo's recent visit to the White House in Washington, D.C., where he met with U.S. President Donald Trump, who gifted him a golden key to the residence. The timing of the decision, following a high-profile meeting with Trump and amid the strategic alliance between Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino over the 2026 World Cup hosted in the U.S., has raised suspicions of political influence. Media outlet The Athletic condemned the decision as lacking precedent, logic, and consistency, calling it a 'symbolic' punishment that undermines FIFA's credibility by prioritizing star power and commercial appeal over rule enforcement. The Athletic stated that the decision 'undermines the organization\u2019s integrity' by failing to establish a clear precedent while exempting a global star.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 11:05 AM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202511261954005)\n\n**Ronaldo can play in 2026 World Cup opener as FIFA 'suspend' ban**\nCristiano Ronaldo, the 40-year-old Portuguese football star and men's all-time top international goalscorer with 143 goals, is eligible to play in the opening matches of the 2026 World Cup after FIFA imposed a partially 'suspended' ban. The ban followed a red card Ronaldo received in November during a 2-0 loss to Ireland, marking his first dismissal in 226 international appearances after elbowing Dara O'Shea. FIFA originally suspended him for three matches, but two of those are suspended under a one-year probation period. According to FIFA\u2019s Disciplinary Code, Article 27, if Ronaldo commits another offense of similar severity during this probation, the suspended matches will be enforced immediately.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has sparked a major controversy and a U.S. Senate investigation into alleged cronyism and mismanagement. The Kennedy Center\u2019s contract with FIFA, obtained by Senate staff, shows FIFA is granted exclusive use of the Concert Hall and other facilities for a $0.00 rental fee. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the arrangement in a letter to Kennedy Center President Ric Grenell, accusing the Center of being 'looted' and deviating from its statutory mission to promote American performing arts. Whitehouse demanded explanations by December 4, including internal cost estimates, scheduling impacts, and board approvals, and questioned whether FIFA\u2019s creation of a 'Peace Prize'\u2014with speculation that it would be awarded to Donald Trump during the event\u2014factored into the decision. Grenell denied the allegations, claiming FIFA paid millions and covered all event costs through donations and sponsorship opportunities, totaling $7.4 million according to a Center spokeswoman. However, no written evidence was provided, and the structure of payments\u2014donations instead of rental fees\u2014raises questions among tax and nonprofit experts, especially given FIFA\u2019s Swiss nonprofit status and its U.S.-registered subsidiary, FWC2026 US, Inc. The event, scheduled for December 5, will occupy multiple venues at the Center, including the Concert Hall, Eisenhower Theatre, and rooftop spaces, displacing scheduled performances. The move follows the Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of the Center\u2019s leadership in February 2024, replacing Biden-appointed officials with Trump allies. Since then, the Center has hosted non-art events such as the Christian Persecution Summit and a vigil for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, while ticket sales have reportedly declined. FIFA\u2019s choice of the Kennedy Center reportedly came at Trump\u2019s suggestion, with Trump stating, 'We will lay out the red carpet.' The event has drawn scrutiny due to its political undertones, the lack of transparency around payments, and concerns over the Center\u2019s mission being compromised. FIFA has not confirmed whether it is sponsoring the Center or if the 'Peace Prize' will be awarded to Trump, though Infantino has publicly praised Trump and maintained a close relationship with him since the 2026 World Cup bid.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 03:25 PM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6835424/2025/11/25/world-cup-draw-kennedy-center-controversy-fifa-washington-dc/)\n\n**FIFA announces new peace prize to be awarded during World Cup draw**\nFIFA has announced the creation of a new annual award, the FIFA Peace Prize, to be first awarded during the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., on December 5, 2025, at the Kennedy Center.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has publicly praised Trump as a 'champion of world peace' and stated on October 9, 2024, that Trump 'definitely deserves' the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in Gaza. However, the Nobel was awarded to Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a pro-democracy activist in Venezuela, on that day. Infantino responded to questions about Trump winning the FIFA prize by laughing and saying, 'On the 5th of December, you will see.' The announcement coincides with a growing alliance between Infantino and Trump, who are jointly hosting the 2026 World Cup across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. FIFA has not disclosed the selection process, criteria, or who will decide the winner. The prize marks a departure from tradition, as the World Cup draw has historically focused solely on soccer. The move is widely perceived as a symbolic response to Trump\u2019s snub by the Nobel committee, though no FIFA officials have publicly confirmed this.

The inaugural award will be presented on December 5, 2025, during the World Cup 2026 group stage draw in Washington DC. FIFA President Gianni Infantino emphasized that the prize recognizes those who work to end conflicts and bring people together in peace. The timing and context have sparked speculation that the award may be intended as a symbolic gesture toward former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a global peacemaker and previously sought the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014though he did not receive it. Infantino has publicly praised Trump\u2019s role in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiations, stating that 'without president Trump, there would be no peace' and that Trump 'has broken barriers, built bridges, and brought people together.' The award ceremony coincides with the World Cup 2026 draw, which will determine the group stage matchups for the tournament hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 04:23 PM\nSource:[Brabants Dagblad](https://www.bd.nl/voetbal/cadeautje-voor-donald-trump-fifa-baas-gianni-infantino-verzint-jaarlijkse-vredesprijs~a893f5d5/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse set of expert domains\u2014including FIFA institutional governance, international sports diplomacy, public relations, political science, international relations, and sociology\u2014there is a consistent, strong expectation that Donald Trump will win the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize at the December 5, 2025, World Cup draw. Experts cite as primary factors the unprecedented personal relationship and overt alliance between FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Donald Trump, the deliberate choice of event location (Washington D.C., at the Kennedy Center, which Trump now influences), and widespread media and internal speculation pointing directly to Trump as the intended recipient. Secondary factors increasing the likelihood include a lack of transparent award criteria, FIFA's history of transactional/pragmatic awards, and the contextual narrative of the prize as a symbolic compensation for Trump's Nobel Peace Prize snub. \n\nWhile every forecast acknowledges significant risks\u2014including severe reputational backlash, active U.S. Senate investigation, negative global media coverage, and possible sponsor pressure\u2014most conclude that FIFA and Infantino's established tolerance for controversy and focus on consolidating elite political alliances outweigh the downsides, barring a dramatic late-stage intervention. Probability forecasts among experts range from 68% to 93%, with most clustered between 80% and 90%. The main caveats highlighted are the potential for a last-minute reversal under unprecedented external pressure or a tactical move to share or dilute the prize among less controversial recipients, but such scenarios are deemed unlikely given the current evidence and FIFA's leadership style. In sum, the consensus is that Trump remains the overwhelming favorite to receive the prize, with a small but real chance of FIFA pivoting at the last moment if reputational risks are suddenly judged unmanageable.",
