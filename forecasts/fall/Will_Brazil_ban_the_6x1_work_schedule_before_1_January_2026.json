Both statutory and constitutional efforts have repeatedly stalled, and the required legislative steps (report, committee, floor votes in two chambers) make passage before the end of 2025 logistically challenging. Though social mobilization has, in rare cases, tipped Congressional outcomes, the scale here (e.g. 10,000s to 100,000s in protest vs. millions needed, with election distractions looming) appears insufficient to force a true legislative reversal by 1 January 2026. The strongest base rate is that major changes to national labor standards in Brazil have not happened on this fast a timetable since the 1988 constitution. Thus, the likelihood of a ban on the 6x1 schedule for most CLT jobs before the deadline\u2014which would require an accelerated, unprecedented legislative about-face\u2014is quite low.",

News reports show strong union mobilization, some public and executive momentum, and a parallel with past successful mobilizations (e.g., against the PEC da Blindagem). However, a majority of deputies remain opposed (~70%), and business resistance and economic uncertainty further dampen prospects. While union and civil society activism could erode opposition given the right conditions, there is scant evidence of the kind of seismic political transformation needed within the narrow window left in 2025. In sum: significant public agitation and executive alignment are not yet sufficient to overcome entrenched legislative and employer opposition, especially given the legislative calendar, electoral incentives, and absence of a breakthrough coalition. I therefore estimate the chance of a Brazil-wide 6x1 ban for CLT workers passing before 1 January 2026 at 14% (rounded down slightly from the initial 86% for a 'No' outcome).",

The recent defeat of the 'PEC da Blindagem' under mass protest offers a recent instance where elite calculations were shifted by public pressure, but that was a defensive, nonpartisan response; labor reform is intrinsically more divisive. Given the very high level of reported legislative opposition, divided business and party interests, and the increasingly tight deadline for the parliamentary calendar (including required committee hearings and plenaries), the odds remain against passage pre-2026, but the existence of alternative legislative vehicles (ordinary law), growing salience, and high-profile government support means the possibility cannot be dismissed.

The analysis links both the slow, veto-heavy process (especially for constitutional amendments) and entrenched center/right opposition, which are critical factors in Brazilian labor law reform. The recognition that there is a real disconnect between high-profile executive or societal support and the mechanics of successful legal passage is accurate\u2014most reforms that shift labor time or established models in Brazil have historically taken years and either been diluted, delayed, or derailed by party discipline and committee bottlenecks. This reasoning is consistent both with the letter and spirit of the Brazilian legislative process, appropriately focusing skepticism on scenario probabilities in the absence of historic levels of mobilization or coalition shifts. While the forecast could further discuss the possibility of a statutory route, its emphasis on the legislative bottlenecks and the requirements for covering 'most CLT jobs' aligns with CLT-specific legal complexities and gives the scenario sound plausibility weighting."

However, from a public policy process angle, I think their estimate underweights two factors: (1) the increasing tactical considerations being observed on the ground\u2014namely, the strategic push to pivot from a PEC to an ordinary legislative bill (PL), for which both government and union leadership are now openly advocating; and (2) the precedent for rapid legal changes under acute pressure, particularly when the executive is aligned and faced with organized street protest. While such pivots don't guarantee success (especially as legislative inertia is strong), history shows that, when policy entrepreneurs capitalize on moments of high salience, a fast-tracked bill is not out of the question\u2014especially if opposition sees risk in being seen as anti-worker before an election year. In short, the base rate for full constitutional change justifies skepticism, but the alternative (statutory) legislative path deserves greater weight as it has become more salient in current political strategy and communication, potentially nudging probabilities a bit higher."

As procedural discussions and political actors increasingly signal interest in statutory, not just constitutional, shifts, this should be incorporated more fully into the scenario analysis. While my own institutionalist perspective holds that path dependency and veto points remain dominant, I acknowledge that legislative pivots in Brazil under mass mobilization are not unheard of. Hence, the probability range (18%) could plausibly be accepted, if more clearly grounded in a dual-path (PEC vs. PL) risk assessment; as it stands, this dimension is somewhat muted, and updating the reasoning to weigh near-term statutory maneuvers more explicitly would sharpen calibration."

However, as a specialist in Brazilian Political Economy, I note that the forecast underappreciates both the present tactical focus on statutory (PL) routes and the empirical evidence that, under sustained executive direction and mass mobilization, the Brazilian Congress has occasionally accelerated action on urgent labor or social measures\u2014particularly when there is visible electoral or parliamentary risk in appearing out of step with mass sentiment. The ongoing pivot by PT and union leaders to ordinary law, rather than solely constitutional amendment, reveals a pragmatic understanding of procedural obstacles, making rapid passage\u2014though still unlikely\u2014less improbable than the traditional base rate for a PEC. Since the question resolves Yes for *any* ban covering most CLT jobs, this scenario should be addressed more centrally in the probability estimate and scenario mapping.

In particular, defenses of the statutory bill route underscore that while still unlikely, the probability of rapid passage via a PL is not negligible if a late political or social surge occurs. This nuance slightly widens the probability distribution toward a 'Yes' outcome, especially as even a narrowly-constructed ordinary law could fulfill the question's criteria. Nonetheless, all deliberation converges on the exceptional difficulty of overcoming opposition in the final quarter of 2025.

Nevertheless, there is still no evidence of a breakthrough coalition or a fast-moving bill nearing success. The likelihood of such a rapid legislative pivot, historically rare for labor reforms of this magnitude in Brazil, remains low. The deliberation marginally increased my sensitivity to late-stage legislative pivots but not enough to significantly shift the probability upwards.

The critique of some forecasts for underappreciating the statutory (PL) avenue is valid, but the strongest consensus is that, even with this, success is rare absent historic and immediate political realignment. No new evidence has emerged to raise my estimate above my initial 18%; if anything, the continued weight of base rates and practical barriers could argue for a slight reduction.

The group made a compelling case that, while base rates are low, current conditions (plebiscite, organized labor push, and executive signaling) create a policy window, albeit a narrow one.

This tactical adaptation moderately increases the plausibility of rapid, non-constitutional legislative change\u2014especially if public mobilization and executive alignment hit a new crescendo in October-November.

The campaign, led by groups such as the MST, MTST, CUT, CTB, Sinteal, and left\u2011wing parties PT, PCdoB and PSOL, has been collecting votes and signatures since July, extending the period by a month to pressure the National Congress.  In Alagoas, physical ballot boxes were moved through schools, markets and other public spaces, while online voting codes were also distributed.  Organizers estimate that the plebiscite will exceed 10\u202f000 votes, though the exact total is not yet known.  The campaign\u2019s president, Izael\u202fRibeiro of Sinteal, said the widespread participation \u201cwas very large\u201d and that the proposal \u201chas a very positive reaction\u201d (Izael\u202fRibeiro, quoted).  He added that the results will be presented to President Lula next week to push for the reform of the income\u2011tax table, which is already in Congress under the sponsorship of Senator Renan\u202fCalheiros and Deputy Arthur\u202fLira.  The article notes that the plebiscite is a constitutional instrument (Art.\u202f14 of the Constitution, Lei\u202f9.709/98) that allows citizens to be consulted before a law is enacted.  The campaign\u2019s goal is to secure a tax\u2011justice measure that exempts those earning below R$5\u202f000 while increasing taxes on those earning above R$50\u202f000.

He said that without popular pressure the PEC would not advance, noting that the topic \"has great difficulty tramitar no Congresso Nacional\" and that a \"livre, leve, solto\" parliament would only harm workers. Marinho made the remarks on the \"Bom Dia Ministro\" program on the federal government channel. The PEC, introduced by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL\u2011SP) in February, proposes moving to a 4\u00d73 or 5\u00d72 schedule, arguing that 6\u00d71 \"escravizes workers\" by limiting family time.

The campaign, led by groups such as the MST, MTST, CUT, CTB, Sinteal, and left\u2011wing parties PT, PCdoB and PSOL, has been collecting votes and signatures since July, extending the period by a month to pressure the National Congress.  In Alagoas, physical ballot boxes were moved through schools, markets and other public spaces, while online voting codes were also distributed.  Organizers estimate that the plebiscite will exceed 10\u202f000 votes, though the exact total is not yet known.  The campaign\u2019s president, Izael\u202fRibeiro of Sinteal, said the widespread participation \u201cwas very large\u201d and that the proposal \u201chas a very positive reaction\u201d (Izael\u202fRibeiro, quoted).  He added that the results will be presented to President Lula next week to push for the reform of the income\u2011tax table, which is already in Congress under the sponsorship of Senator Renan\u202fCalheiros and Deputy Arthur\u202fLira.  The article notes that the plebiscite is a constitutional instrument (Art.\u202f14 of the Constitution, Lei\u202f9.709/98) that allows citizens to be consulted before a law is enacted.  The campaign\u2019s goal is to secure a tax\u2011justice measure that exempts those earning below R$5\u202f000 while increasing taxes on those earning above R$50\u202f000.

The proposal would require the pension to be paid within 30 days, the period allowed by current law, and if the payment is not resolved in that time, a provisional payment would be made. If the institution fails to comply, a 5\u202f% compensation on the unpaid amount would be granted. The bill preserves the existing exceptions in the Social Security Law for state and municipal public servants, such as incompatibility of pensions, suspension upon re\u2011entry to public service, verification or doubt of documents, revocation for acts affecting granted rights, and restitution of improper payments.\n\nThe proponent, Deputy Maricela Beltr\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez (MC), emphasized that the goal is to protect retirees from administrative inefficiency and financial disorder. She noted that while the law allows a maximum of 30 working days to resolve requests, in practice the processes are taking more than a year.\n\nAccording to the proposal, official data show that 59\u202f% of ISSEMyM\u2019s total spending in 2024 was allocated to pensions and retirements. The document also states that \"no obstante, se han documentado inmensos rezagos administrativos y retrasos de meses o incluso a\u00f1os para que los beneficiarios reciban lo que en justicia les corresponde\". The institute faces a severe budget contingency; in 2023 its expenditures totaled 38\u202f846\u202fmillion pesos, exceeding its revenues of 37\u202f832.98\u202fmillion pesos, confirming an operating deficit.\n\nThe bill would therefore ensure timely pension payments, provide provisional coverage if delays occur, and impose a penalty for non\u2011compliance, aiming to safeguard retirees from prolonged administrative delays.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 05:43 PM\nSource:[Portal Diario](https://diarioportal.com/legislatura/proponen-impedir-por-ley-retraso-en-pago-de-pensiones-del-issemym)\n\n**STF Validates Loss of Mandate if Politician Leaves Party to Create New Party**\nOn September 26\u202f2025, the Supreme Federal Court (STF) confirmed that a politician who leaves a party to create a new one will lose their mandate, a decision that relies on a 30\u2011day window for new parties to receive parliamentarians without risk of revocation. The ruling was supported by six ministers following rapporteur Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso, who argued that the change, enacted by law\u202f13.165/15, aims to reduce party fragmentation and frequent defections. The case was brought by Rede Sustentabilidade, whose party was registered with the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) in September\u202f2015 and would have had a 30\u2011day period to accept new members under the old rules. Barroso said, 'A migra\u00e7\u00e3o constante de parlamentares entre partidos esvazia a escolha feita nas urnas e enfraquece o papel dos partidos como express\u00e3o de projetos pol\u00edticos duradouros.'

He said that without popular pressure the PEC would not advance, noting that the topic \"has great difficulty tramitar no Congresso Nacional\" and that a \"livre, leve, solto\" parliament would only harm workers. Marinho made the remarks on the \"Bom Dia Ministro\" program on the federal government channel. The PEC, introduced by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL\u2011SP) in February, proposes moving to a 4\u00d73 or 5\u00d72 schedule, arguing that 6\u00d71 \"escravizes workers\" by limiting family time.

Under the new rule, a customer must authorize the debit in the app of their financial institution before the money leaves their account. The BC says the mandatory use of Pix automatic brings greater convenience and control to customers and prevents unauthorized charges. The measures take effect on 13 October 2025, with a deadline of 1 January 2026 for institutions to adjust contracts and authorizations. The BC claims that Pix automatic can increase competition, reduce delinquency, improve operational efficiency and lower collection costs. The rule does not apply when the institution that holds the payer\u2019s account is also the recipient of the funds. The article explains how Pix automatic works for recurring payments and outlines additional security measures the BC is implementing after a series of cyber attacks, such as limiting Pix access for institutions using PSTIs, tightening transaction value limits, and extending the block period for large transfers. The BC says, 'O BC diz que a ado\u00e7\u00e3o do Pix autom\u00e1tico tem o potencial de aumentar a competi\u00e7\u00e3o, reduzir a inadimpl\u00eancia, elevar a efici\u00eancia de processos operacionais e diminuir os custos dos procedimentos de cobran\u00e7a.'

The rejection was unanimous, with the Senate\u2019s Constitution and Justice Committee and President Davi Alcolumbre voting against it. The author frames this decision as evidence that the \"ronco das ruas\" (the roar of the streets) still holds power over the Congress.\n\nThe piece traces the history of the \"ronco das ruas\" from the early 1960s, when President Jo\u00e3o Goulart relied on popular mobilisations to defend his reforms, through the 1968 \"Passeata dos 100 Mil\" in Rio de Janeiro, where more than 100,000 students, artists, intellectuals and workers protested the military regime. The protest was followed on 13\u202fDecember\u202f1968 by the decree of AI\u20115, which closed Congress, suspended civil liberties and granted absolute power to the executive, ushering in the most brutal phase of the dictatorship.\n\nAfter two decades of silence, the \"ronco das ruas\" re\u2011emerged during the Diretas J\u00e1 movement (1983\u20111984). Leaders such as Ulysses Guimar\u00e3es, Leonel Brizola and Tancredo Neves used the popular pressure\u2014\"mais de um milh\u00e3o\" attended the Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9 rally\u2014to push Congress toward redemocratization, culminating in the 1988 Constitution.\n\nThe article then highlights the 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2023 inauguration of President Lula, where \"centenas de milhares\" of Brazilians gathered in Bras\u00edlia, a democratic celebration that forced the Bolsonaro\u2011led coup plotters to postpone their attempt. The failed coup on 8\u202fJanuary\u202f2024 is described as a \"golpe dentro do golpe\" that was thwarted by institutional resistance and international pressure.\n\nFinally, the author notes that on 21\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 the \"ronco das ruas\" again echoed strongly, threatening to halt attempts at amnesty, shielding and fa\u00e7ade pacification that would absolve former coup plotters. The narrative concludes that Congress moves not by virtue but by calculation, and the roar of the streets is decisive.\n\nKey metrics cited: 100\u202f000 protesters in 1968; more than 1\u202fmillion at the Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9 rally; 21\u202fyears of dictatorship (1964\u20111985); 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2023 inauguration; 8\u202fJanuary\u202f2024 coup attempt; 21\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 protests.\n\nNotable quotes from the article (single\u2011quoted as requested): 'o ronco das ruas', 'PEC da Bandidagem', 'PEC da Blindagem', 'AI\u20115', 'golpe dentro do golpe', 'Diretas J\u00e1', 'Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o Cidad\u00e3', 'ronco das ruas', 'Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o Cidad\u00e3', 'ronco das ruas', 'ronco das ruas', 'ronco das ruas'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 11:27 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/blog/o-ronco-das-ruas-o-enterro-da-pec-da-blindagem-e-o-8-de-janeiro)\n\n**Minister of Labor says government supports ending 6x1 schedule and defends 'pressure' on Congress**\nThe Brazilian Minister of Labor, Luiz Marinho, said on September 25, 2025 that ending the 6\u2011day work schedule (6x1) will only succeed if the National Congress is subjected to 'muita press\u00e3o' (heavy pressure).

The article notes that this issue was part of the Livre party\u2019s electoral platform and had already been on the agenda of the XXIII Constitutional Government led by Ant\u00f3nio Costa in 2023. It also highlights that Portuguese workers often exceed the 40\u2011hour limit set by Law No. 7/2009 of the Labor Code, with the article explicitly mentioning \"acima das 40 horas permitidas pela Lei n\u00ba 7/2009 do C\u00f3digo do Trabalho.\" These points illustrate the broader context of labor reforms and the push for more flexible working arrangements.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 04:14 PM\nSource:[Jornal Expresso](https://expresso.pt/revista/fisga/2025-09-09-trabalhar-menos-e-melhor--poucas-empresas-experimentam-a-semana-de-quatro-dias-mas-quando-o-fazem-a-maior-parte-nao-quer-voltar-atras-398d5ec2)\n\n**Life Beyond Work: Ending the 6\u00d71 Schedule Revives Brazil's Historical Struggle**\nThe article discusses the Brazilian proposal to abolish the 6\u00d71 work schedule, a system that has been criticized for overworking employees.

The article also reports that Dieese\u2019s April bulletin found the 2017 reform spread the 12\u00d736 schedule and promoted intermittent work, which disrupts social life and professional development. Workers such as Lucas\u202fSidrach of the Vida\u202fAl\u00e9m\u202fdo\u202fTrabalho movement argue that the current schedule hampers family life and mental health, while deputy Beatriz\u202fCerqueira (PT) posted on social media: 'Sim, existe vida al\u00e9m do trabalho\u2026 a luta de classes \u00e9 a matriz de todas as demais lutas'.

The committee was installed on Tuesday (19) and will be linked to the Labor Committee of the Chamber. The plan includes public hearings to hear from entrepreneurs, workers, university professors, and government representatives before the elaboration of the opinion. The intention is for the text to be later discussed in the Constitutional and Justice Commission (CCJ). 'We will evaluate which sectors still adopt the 6\u00d71 scale and what effects this change would have,' Gast\u00e3o said. The proposal also provides for the adoption of a 4\u00d73 schedule (four days of work and three days of rest) and the limitation of weekly working hours to 36 hours, without exceeding eight hours a day. Currently, the Constitution allows up to 44 hours a week. According to the work plan disclosed by the parliamentarian, the subcommittee seeks to consolidate a consensual text that guarantees balance between worker protection, business viability, and public account sustainability. The initiative of the PEC came from the Vida Al\u00e9m do Trabalho movement and has popular support from over 3 million signatures. The proposal had been postponed in 2024, when it depended on analysis by the CCJ, then led by the PL. Now, with the protocol effective, it will be up to the collegiate to evaluate the constitutionality of the measure.

The mobilization, which started spontaneously and gained strength among workers and experts, resulted in the Proposed Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) 8/2025, which proposes to prohibit this model of shift and establish a four-day workweek. However, the discussion about the shift schedule should not be seen as a simple dilemma between maintaining or abolishing the 6x1 schedule. It is necessary to evaluate the possibility of flexibility and negotiation between employers and employees, seeking solutions that respect workers' rights and the need for the labor market to adapt. According to historian data, reducing the work hours does not generate jobs, and in fact, the Brazilian productivity is one of the worst in the world, which would make it difficult for the country to compete externally. The justification that reducing work hours without reducing salaries would boost the Brazilian economy and reduce inequalities is an utopia. The data shows that no reduction in work hours has generated jobs, and the reduction of work hours does not guarantee an increase in quality of life. The approval of the PEC 8/2025 could lead to a wave of judicializations, with relevant impacts on labor law, economy and society.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 05, 2025 11:35 AM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/opiniao/artigos/reduzir-jornada-por-lei-nao-garante-emprego-nem-qualidade-de-vida/)\n\n**Redu\u00e7\u00e3o da jornada e fim da escala 6\u00d71 ser\u00e3o debatidos em evento das centrais sindicais em Porto Alegre**\nThe central unions are promoting an event in Porto Alegre on Monday (4) to discuss the proposal to reduce the working day without cutting salaries and the end of the 6\u00d71 schedule. The activity is part of the national mobilization in support of the Proposal of Constitutional Amendment (PEC) 148/2015, authored by Senator Paulo Paim (PT/RS), which proposes a gradual reduction of the weekly workload from 44 to 36 hours. According to Paim, the measure can generate millions of jobs and improve the quality of life of the working class. A study by the Dieese points out that the change can create around 3 million new jobs immediately. Paim also states that in 19 companies that tested the new model, one of them recorded a growth of almost 15% in revenue and productivity in 2024. 'This measure is fundamental, not only to increase free time and the quality of life of workers, but also to create jobs and promote better living conditions,' Paim explains. The deputy federal Daiana Santos (PCdoB) will also bring her Project of Law n\u00ba 67/2025 to the debate, which proposes a reduction of the weekly working day to 40 hours and the end of the 6\u00d71 schedule, with the guarantee of two consecutive days of remunerated rest per week. Santos defends that the reduction of the working day is a social justice and valuation of the working people agenda. She cites the example of developed countries like Belgium, Germany and Norway, which have adopted shorter working hours for years, understanding that rested and healthy workers are also more productive and contribute to economic growth. 'This is exactly the differential of our PL 67/2025, a possible project to be applied in the short term, with responsibility,' she highlights, recalling that the proposal has already received support from the Minister of Labor, Luiz Marinho, who recognized its viability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 07:54 PM\nSource:[Brasil de Fato](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2025/08/01/reducao-da-jornada-e-fim-da-escala-6x1-serao-debatidos-em-evento-das-centrais-sindicais-em-porto-alegre/)\n\n**Lula Defends Proposal to End 6x1 Work Schedule in Brazil**\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has defended the proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule in Brazil, which has been criticized by some for being too rigid. Lula stated, 'The humanity does not want 6x1 anymore, we need to find a way to have a more flexible work schedule. This was an extraordinary thing in my time, but today's youth does not want this anymore. We will try to present a new way of working in this country, so that we can guarantee more mobility for people.' A survey by the Instituto de Economia da Unicamp found that 37% of workers with a formal contract would benefit directly from the reduction of the work schedule, while 38% of the occupied population, mostly informal workers with a work schedule above 36 hours a week, would be indirectly affected. The proposal to end the 6x1 schedule is supported by 64% of Brazilians, according to a Datafolha survey from December 2024. However, some business entities and trade unions have expressed concerns that the reduction of the work schedule could lead to increased costs for companies, higher prices for products and services, and negative effects on the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 08:48 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2025/07/lula-critica-jornada-6x1-e-diz-que-quer-discutir-assunto-com-empresarios-e-sindicalistas.shtml)\n\n**PT Proposes New Bill to End 6\u00d71 Work Schedule and Reduce Working Hours**\nThe Workers' Party (PT) has submitted a new bill (PL) to the Brazilian Congress, aiming to abolish the 6\u00d71 work schedule and reduce the weekly working hours from 44 to 36 hours without any salary reduction. According to PT members, a quorum of votes for a bill is easier to achieve than the 308 votes required to pass a Constitutional Amendment (PEC). A similar proposal was previously presented by \u00c9rika Hilton (PSol-SP) and Reginaldo Lopes (PT-MG), but none of them have advanced in the Chamber of Deputies due to strong resistance from parliamentarians who believe that reducing working hours would harm employers and the economy. The PT's proposal includes the following points: the inclusion of travel time as part of the working hours for jobs with difficult access or no public transportation; flexibility in negotiating time off for small and micro businesses; a maximum of two hours of overtime per day with special protection for pregnant and breastfeeding women; and the possibility of 12-hour shifts followed by 36 hours of rest for security and health professionals, as long as it is negotiated through a collective labor agreement. The PT justifies the measure by citing a survey that found 72% of Brazilians are stressed at work, and that in 2022, over 209,000 people were absent from work due to mental health issues. As stated by the PT, 'the time has come to rethink the way we work and prioritize the well-being of workers.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[A Rede](https://arede.info/cotidiano/581419/bancada-do-pt-propoe-novo-projeto-pelo-fim-da-escala-de-trabalho-61)\n\n**PT Proposes Bill to End 6x1 Work Schedule and Reduce Work Hours**\nThe Workers' Party (PT) has submitted a bill (PL) to the Brazilian Congress, proposing to end the 6x1 work schedule and reduce the weekly work hours from 44 to 36 hours without reducing salaries.

The proposal also includes changes to the calculation of overtime, the definition of intraday breaks, and the treatment of travel time for workers with difficult access to their workplaces or no public transportation. According to the faction's press office, the initiative will be accompanied by a dialogue with the federal government to discuss the possibility of sending a similar bill to Congress in an urgent constitutional manner. The PT faction argues that, from a legal standpoint, it is not necessary to amend the Constitution to modify the 6\u00d71 shift schedule, as the article 7 of the Constitution only establishes a minimum of labor rights, and the 6\u00d71 schedule is established in the Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT), not in the Constitution. As such, a regular law can modify this regime, as long as it benefits the worker. There are two other initiatives in the works that address the same topic: PEC 221/2019, proposed by Reginaldo Lopes (PT-MG), and PEC 08/2025, proposed by Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 06:33 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/brasil/pt-protocola-projeto-para-reduzir-jornada-de-trabalho-para-36-horas-e-acabar-com-escala-6-1-tqu4avnm)\n\n**Goi\u00e1s Divided: Politicians, Workers, and Businessmen Weigh In on the 6x1 Work Schedule**\nA proposed amendment to the Brazilian Constitution, PEC 8/2025, aims to end the traditional 6x1 work schedule, which requires workers to work six consecutive days and rest only one. The proposal, presented by federal deputy Erika Hilton, seeks to guarantee at least two days of weekly rest to improve the physical and mental health of millions of Brazilians. According to a survey by the Instituto Locomotiva, 57% of the population supports the end of the 6x1 schedule. In Goi\u00e1s, the debate has also moved to local politics. State deputy Bia de Lima is in favor of the change, emphasizing that more rest time is essential, especially for women who work double shifts with domestic work and family care. On the other hand, state deputy Amauri Ribeiro is against the change, arguing that it may harm the economy. This concern is shared by the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Comercial, Industrial e de Servi\u00e7os do Estado de Goi\u00e1s (Acieg), which sees the proposal as a risk of increased costs and loss of competitiveness for companies. The Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores (CUT) defends that a rested worker produces more, gets sick less, and that the change would be positive for health and productivity in general, as said, 'um trabalhador descansado rende mais, adoece menos e que a mudan\u00e7a seria positiva para a sa\u00fade e a produtividade no geral'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 30, 2025 09:19 PM\nSource:[Jornal Op\u00e7\u00e3o](https://www.jornalopcao.com.br/ultimas-noticias/politicos-trabalhadores-e-empresarios-escala-6x1-divide-opinioes-em-goias-721345/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts assign a low probability to Brazil banning the 6x1 work schedule for most CLT workers before 1 January 2026, with final probabilities tightly clustered between 14% and 18%. Despite unprecedented public mobilization\u2014including a plebiscite, union activity, and explicit support from President Lula and the Labor Minister\u2014there is persistent skepticism that this momentum can be converted into legislative success within the short, three-month timeframe left before the deadline. The major obstacles cited include entrenched congressional resistance (about 70% of federal deputies reportedly oppose a ban), strong business and employer lobbying, Brazil\u2019s complex and slow-moving legislative process\u2014especially for constitutional amendments, which require a supermajority\u2014and the imminent electoral calendar, which historically discourages controversial reforms. Several experts acknowledge the slim possibility that extraordinary public pressure or a procedural shortcut (e.g., passage of an ordinary bill rather than a constitutional amendment) could result in a surprise, rapid ban, mirroring rare precedent like the defeat of PEC da Blindagem under mass protest. However, such scenarios are seen as both exceptional and unlikely to materialize quickly enough. Overall, consensus emerges that, while public and union mobilization has made the issue more visible and signaled future momentum, existing legislative dynamics and institutional barriers render a ban on the 6x1 schedule by January 2026 highly improbable.",
