Recovery in international numbers for late arrivals or OPT/carryover is unlikely to fully offset the 2025 disruption, as data show numbers down in both India and China. Numerous schools reported financial strain and open seats. While some resilience is provided by policy flexibility (no test, fee waivers, direct admit), and by the slow year-on-year nature of reporting, the combined magnitude of these negative shocks is high. My best estimate is that the enrollment rate in 2025 will slide to or just below the 26.6% cutoff\u2014close, but more likely under than over, as this represents a compound exogenous shock on top of structural decline.

However, the drop in international undergrads\u2014especially from India and China, who together are a disproportionate share of four-year enrollees\u2014suggests a sharper short-term drop than linear projection.

Critiques of the more optimistic or inertia-based forecasts universally stress the magnitude, abruptness, and one-off nature of the current year\u2019s disruption, as well as the limitations of denominator shrinkage given a collapsing numerator. No substantive argument suggests an overlooked mitigating factor that would substantially increase Caplan\u2019s chances. If anything, the consensus has moved even further toward downside risk, with the modal forecast for a 'Yes' outcome (Caplan wins) now at or below my initial 35%, and several credible models pitched closer to 30%. Given this, it would be reasonable\u2014indeed, prudent\u2014to slightly lower my forecast to 30% to better reflect the intensified, argued consensus regarding the negative shocks' likely dominance. This fine-tunes my probability to more closely track the updated community view, while preserving the recognition of residual uncertainty.",

I win if it\u2019s fallen less.  Since the current rate is 29.9%, he wins if the rate is 26.6% or less.

Only Some**\nWall Street expects a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, with a 90% probability according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. However, the article questions whether this traditional monetary policy will be effective in today's economy, which is marked by structural shifts. Recent data shows a 32,000-job decline in private payrolls, 1.17 million layoff announcements for 2025 (54% higher than the same period last year), cooling wage growth, falling consumer confidence, and rising delinquencies across credit cards, car loans, and student debt. The labor market is showing significant cracks. Historically, rate cuts stimulate the economy by lowering borrowing costs, encouraging investment, hiring, income growth, and consumer spending. However, in today\u2019s K-shaped economy, where wealth concentration is increasing, rate cuts disproportionately benefit higher-income 'Upper-K' Americans who own assets, while lower-income 'Lower-K' Americans\u2014whose purchasing power is eroding\u2014see limited relief. The article argues that automation, AI, and robotics are driving a non-cyclical, structural shift that rate cuts cannot reverse. Even as rate cuts may slightly reduce financial pressure for lower-income households, they do not address job displacement caused by automation. The article concludes that rate cuts will likely boost asset prices and benefit investors more than workers, accelerating wealth concentration. It advocates for a strategic shift toward asset ownership\u2014particularly in AI and automation-driven sectors\u2014as the new path to financial security, framing this as 'American Dream 2.0.' The article promotes a private investor summit where experts will present a portfolio targeting tech and AI stocks, citing a prior portfolio\u2019s 32% return\u2014nearly triple the Dow and more than double the S&P 500\u2014suggesting strong potential for future gains in this new economic paradigm.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 11:15 PM\nSource:[InvestorPlace](https://investorplace.com/2025/12/will-a-rate-cut-really-help-only-some/)\n\n**96% of US Colleges Say Visa Delays Are Killing Enrollment: Inside the State Department's Catastrophic Failure**\nA catastrophic breakdown in the U.S. student visa processing system in 2025 has led to a 17% decline in new international student enrollment, the first drop after four years of post-COVID recovery, costing the U.S. economy $1.1 billion and nearly 23,000 jobs. According to a survey of 828 U.S. institutions, 96% reported that visa delays were a key factor in enrollment declines, and 91% reported visa denials affecting admitted students\u2014many of whom had already paid deposits and received Form I-20s. The crisis intensified after a three-week visa processing pause from May 27 to June 18, which disrupted the peak application window for fall enrollment and created a cascading backlog. Wait times varied dramatically by location, with students in India, China, Nigeria, and Vietnam facing months-long delays, turning the process into a geographic lottery. Denial rates rose sharply, with Section 214(b), administrative processing, and documentation issues cited as common reasons\u2014despite applicants being academically qualified. In contrast, competitor countries like Canada, the UK, Australia, and Germany have streamlined, reliable systems with faster processing, clear timelines, and post-study work rights, leading many students to choose alternatives. The State Department\u2019s October 2025 improvements\u201492% of locations offering appointments within two months\u2014came too late to prevent the damage. Chronic understaffing, budget constraints, pandemic-era backlogs, and poor coordination with academic calendars have undermined the system.

Experts call for immediate staffing surges, technology upgrades, standardized adjudication, and long-term structural reforms to restore trust. As Priya Sharma, who transferred to the University of Toronto, said: 'I wanted America first. But America told me no. Canada said yes in four weeks. I'm not looking back.'

Research universities, such as Johns Hopkins and MIT, rely heavily on federal research funding, which accounted for 40% of their total revenue in 2022-23. However, financial strain also stems from declining enrollment\u20148.4% fewer students in 2024 compared to the 2010 peak of 21 million\u2014and reduced demand for certain academic programs. Many institutions, especially private nonprofits, operate like businesses, seeking revenue by admitting students with minimal academic requirements when seats are available, though fixed costs like faculty salaries and maintenance limit flexibility. Schools are increasingly competing through price discrimination, offering financial aid and scholarships\u2014Harvard\u2019s average net price in 2023-24 was $17,900\u2014while relying on international students, who historically paid full tuition. However, foreign enrollment dropped 17% from fall 2024 to 2025, with Chinese student numbers falling from 317,299 in 2019 to 265,919 in 2024-25 due to stricter U.S. visa policies, geopolitical tensions, and increased competition from universities in Australia, Canada, and the UK. Additionally, the perceived value of a college degree is under scrutiny: only 22% of Americans believe a degree is worth the cost if financed through loans. Data from the University of Texas at Arlington shows stark disparities in return on investment\u2014drama majors earned $14,933 one year post-graduation, with a negative $324,210 return over a decade, while civil engineering graduates earned $105,377 after 10 years, yielding a positive return of $1.15 million. The authors urge students and parents to treat college selection like a major financial decision, demanding transparency on graduate earnings and employment outcomes to drive institutional reform.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 03, 2025 01:25 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/federal-funding-cuts-are-only-one-problem-facing-americas-colleges-and-universities-268974)\n\n**Should College Come With a Money-Back Guarantee?**\nThe U.S. Department of Education has proposed new rules allowing students to sue universities for tuition reimbursement if the institution substantially misrepresents key aspects of education, such as graduate employability or program content. Unlike traditional fraud law (mens rea), which requires proof of intent, this new standard permits lawsuits even if the misrepresentation was unintentional\u2014such as a clerical error. This could expose universities, including public institutions like the University of Colorado at Boulder, to liability, potentially requiring taxpayer funding for refunds. The proposal arises amid concerns over rising student debt\u2014$1.2 trillion in 2015\u2014and low graduation rates, with less than 20% of full-time students at public four-year colleges earning degrees within four years. The article draws a parallel between education and consumer goods: just as consumers can return defective products like cars, TVs, or spoiled milk for refunds, students might reasonably expect a similar recourse if their degree fails to deliver promised outcomes, such as job placement in their field. The central question posed is whether college should come with a money-back guarantee, reflecting a broader debate about accountability, value, and consumer protection in higher education.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2016 08:34 AM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/08/26/should-college-come-with-a-money-back-guarantee.html)\n\n**Will a Rate Cut Really Help?

Ohio State (12-0 SU, 10-1-1 ATS) is favored, with the spread moving from -5.5 to -4.5 and then to -4 by Wednesday, despite sharp betting activity on Indiana +5.5 and public preference for Ohio State. Caesars Sports' Joey Feazel notes the game has major Heisman implications, with Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza a favorite over Ohio State\u2019s Julian Sayin. College football expert Paul Stone sees more significance for Indiana, as a win would be monumental for the program, while Ohio State remains in playoff contention regardless. In the SEC Championship, Georgia (11-1 SU/5-7 ATS) is a 1.5-point favorite over Alabama (10-2 SU/7-4-1 ATS), with strong early action on Georgia and concerns about Alabama\u2019s playoff chances if they lose. The total remains stable at 47.5. In the ACC Championship, Duke (7-5 SU/5-6-1 ATS) faces Virginia (10-2 SU/8-4 ATS), with Virginia moving from a 2.5-point favorite to -3.5 despite the record gap. Feazel warns that a Duke upset could lead to two non-Power 5 teams in the College Football Playoff, with James Madison, Tulane, or North Texas likely to be ranked ahead of Duke. In the Big 12 Championship, Texas Tech (11-1 SU/10-2 ATS) is a 12.5-point favorite over BYU (11-1 SU/9-3 ATS), with heavy betting on Texas Tech and a need on BYU and the Under. A $40,000 BetMGM wager on Georgia +1000 to win the national title would net $400,000 if successful. Conversely, a $615,000 multi-bet on Texas, Penn State, and Clemson all lost after those teams were eliminated, underscoring the importance of responsible betting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 06:41 PM\nSource:[FOX Sports](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-football/college-football-week-15-betting-report)\n\n**96% of US Colleges Say Visa Delays Are Killing Enrollment: Inside the State Department's Catastrophic Failure**\nA catastrophic breakdown in the U.S. student visa processing system in 2025 has led to a 17% decline in new international student enrollment, the first drop after four years of post-COVID recovery, costing the U.S. economy $1.1 billion and nearly 23,000 jobs.

The Power Four title games on Saturday will determine College Football Playoff participants and seeding. The latest odds include Texas Tech as a -12.5 favorite over BYU in the Big 12, Georgia favored by -2.5 over Alabama in the SEC, Ohio State at -4.5 against Indiana in the Big Ten, and Virginia as a -3.5 favorite over Duke in the ACC. Legendary Vegas handicapper Bruce Marshall, who has a 64-43 record and over 16 units return in 2024, recommends backing Virginia (-3.5) against Duke in the ACC Championship, citing the Cavaliers' 7-3 record against the spread in their last 10 games and a 7-0 run under the total. He also supports the Under (57.5) in the 8 p.m. ET nightcap, noting that the teams previously met in November with Virginia winning 34-17, and the game hit the Under (60.5). Marshall also highlights a team on a 14-2 spread run dating back to the previous year.

Research universities, such as Johns Hopkins and MIT, rely heavily on federal research funding, which accounted for 40% of their total revenue in 2022-23. However, financial strain also stems from declining enrollment\u20148.4% fewer students in 2024 compared to the 2010 peak of 21 million\u2014and reduced demand for certain academic programs. Many institutions, especially private nonprofits, operate like businesses, seeking revenue by admitting students with minimal academic requirements when seats are available, though fixed costs like faculty salaries and maintenance limit flexibility. Schools are increasingly competing through price discrimination, offering financial aid and scholarships\u2014Harvard\u2019s average net price in 2023-24 was $17,900\u2014while relying on international students, who historically paid full tuition. However, foreign enrollment dropped 17% from fall 2024 to 2025, with Chinese student numbers falling from 317,299 in 2019 to 265,919 in 2024-25 due to stricter U.S. visa policies, geopolitical tensions, and increased competition from universities in Australia, Canada, and the UK. Additionally, the perceived value of a college degree is under scrutiny: only 22% of Americans believe a degree is worth the cost if financed through loans. Data from the University of Texas at Arlington shows stark disparities in return on investment\u2014drama majors earned $14,933 one year post-graduation, with a negative $324,210 return over a decade, while civil engineering graduates earned $105,377 after 10 years, yielding a positive return of $1.15 million. The authors urge students and parents to treat college selection like a major financial decision, demanding transparency on graduate earnings and employment outcomes to drive institutional reform.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 03, 2025 01:25 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/federal-funding-cuts-are-only-one-problem-facing-americas-colleges-and-universities-268974)\n\n**Lipscomb vs. Tennessee Tech prediction, odds: 2025 college basketball picks from proven model - CBS Sports**\nOn December 3, 2025, the Lipscomb Bison hosted the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles in a men's college basketball game at Allen Arena in Nashville, with tipoff at noon ET. Lipscomb entered the game with a 4-4 record, while Tennessee Tech had a 3-5 record but had recently faced stronger competition, including losses to Georgia and Kentucky. The betting line favored Tennessee Tech by 10.5 points, with an over/under set at 151.5 points. According to the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulated the game 10,000 times, the model predicts the game will go Over the total of 151.5 points. Both teams had gone Over in their previous games, and the model projects four players to score at least 10 points.

Federal data show that overall college acceptance rates have risen from about 5 in 10 applicants a decade ago to 6 in 10 today. To attract students, colleges are implementing one-click applications, waiving application fees (e.g., 130 New York state colleges waived $50\u2013$90 fees in October), offering automatic admission to students who meet high school benchmarks (e.g., California State University accepts students with a C or higher in required courses), and extending unsolicited offers through the Common App\u2014210 institutions made such offers in the 2025 cycle, nearly double the previous year. Pace University offers $1,000 annual financial aid to campus visitors, as research shows visitation doubles enrollment likelihood. Despite these efforts, perceptions persist: a Pew Research Center survey found 45% of Americans ages 18\u201329 believe college admissions is harder than for their parents\u2019 generation, and over 75% find the process complex, with more than half calling it the most stressful experience in school. However, students who have already applied report lower stress levels than those preparing to apply. While direct admission and fee waivers increase applications\u2014NY state saw a 41% rise in SUNY applications during a fee-waiver month\u2014experts like James Murphy of Education Reform Now caution that such reforms primarily benefit colleges by boosting enrollment, not students, unless paired with financial aid and support. Additionally, colleges are extending deadlines, recruiting after May 1, and making standardized test scores optional (over 2,000 institutions now do so). A lawsuit has been filed against 32 schools practicing early decision, which binds students to enroll if accepted, arguing it limits financial aid negotiation. Experts like Kevin Krebs of HelloCollege emphasize that 'if you have the grades, you're going to get in' at many schools, asserting that students now hold more control over the process.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-25/college-admission-process-easier-less-stressful-as-applicant-pool-declines)\n\n**Colleges say foreign students feel 'unwelcome' in the U.S. amid big drop in international enrollment, new survey finds**\nA new survey by the Institute of International Education, based on responses from 828 U.S. colleges and universities, reveals a 17% drop in new international student enrollment for the fall 2025 semester, continuing a trend that saw a 7% decline in 2024. The decline is largely attributed to policies under the Trump administration, which targeted international education and immigration, including revoking visas of at least 1,800 foreign students (later reversed), pausing all new student visa interviews, proposing social media screening for applicants, and attempting to revoke Harvard University\u2019s ability to host international students\u2014a move blocked by a court. Nearly all institutions reporting decreased enrollment cited visa issues as a major obstacle, up from 64% during the first year of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Additionally, two-thirds of schools said foreign students now feel 'unwelcome' in the U.S., a significant increase from 25% four years ago, with a similar proportion citing America\u2019s 'social and political environment' as a deterrent. Although overall international enrollment declined by only 1%, this marks a reversal from post-pandemic growth. International students, who typically pay higher tuition and contribute $42.9 billion to the U.S. economy annually, supported over 355,000 American jobs in 2024\u201325; the current decline is projected to cost $1.1 billion and 23,000 jobs. Most international students are in graduate programs and concentrated in elite institutions on the East Coast and in California. Despite earlier hardline policies, President Trump recently adopted a softer tone, stating during a Fox News interview that reducing international enrollment too much would 'destroy our entire university and college system' and defending a plan to offer 600,000 visas to Chinese students, saying, 'It's not that I want them, but I view it as a business.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 09:48 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/colleges-say-foreign-students-feel-unwelcome-in-the-us-amid-big-drop-in-international-enrollment-new-survey-finds-214812113.html)\n\n**Trump Policies Blamed as U.S. Colleges See Sharp Drop in New International Students - Inquisitr News**\nUniversities across the United States are experiencing their steepest decline in new international student enrollment in years, with a 17% drop in new international students for the fall 2025 semester, following a 7% decline in the 2024\u20132025 academic year, according to the Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education. Campus officials attribute the downturn largely to policies under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, including a month-long pause in visa interviews over the summer, stricter vetting, and fewer available appointments, which left many admitted students unable to secure visas or arrive on time. More than half of surveyed institutions reported allowing students to defer enrollment, while a large majority said they continue to value international students for their academic and cultural contributions and financial importance\u2014nearly 60% acknowledged their role in stabilizing institutional budgets. Despite the drop in new arrivals, overall foreign student enrollment is rising due to increased participation in Optional Practical Training (OPT), which grew by 21%, and longer stays in graduate and doctoral programs. India has become the top sending country for U.S. students for the second consecutive year, with over 363,000 Indian students enrolled in 2024\u20132025, a 10% increase, while China\u2019s enrollment declined by 4% to about 266,000. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s top destination for international students, hosting roughly 1.2 million in 2024\u20132025 and contributing nearly $55 billion to the economy. However, Trump has issued mixed signals: while he recently stated that foreign students are 'good for business' and beneficial for U.S. competitiveness, his administration has enforced strict visa crackdowns and high-profile enforcement actions. University recruiters are now working to reassure prospective international students, but concerns remain over whether the decline in new enrollment\u2014falling at a double-digit rate\u2014is a temporary dip or the beginning of a long-term shift.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[The Inquisitr](https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-policies-blamed-as-u-s-colleges-see-sharp-drop-in-new-international-students)\n\n**2025 Big Bets Report: Bettor Wins Nearly $850k on $15, 17-Leg Parlay**\nA Hard Rock Bet customer won $843,475.72 on a $15, 17-leg parlay involving college football point spreads and totals across multiple conferences, including the Big Ten, SEC, ACC, Big 12, Mountain West, and Sun Belt. The bet, placed at 7:06 a.m. ET on Saturday, had odds of +5623171 (over 56,000/1), and succeeded despite close calls, including Syracuse covering +28.5 by half a point and Vanderbilt covering -6.5 by half a point in a game that went to overtime. At DraftKings, a $10 bonus bet on a 13-leg parlay of anytime touchdown scorers and Daniel Jones exceeding 250 passing yards paid out $200,982.66, with Jones reaching 255 yards in overtime. On FanDuel, a $10 two-leg parlay on Jonathan Taylor and Jahmyr Gibbs each scoring three or more touchdowns returned $1,590 profit. Another FanDuel bettor placed $3.06 on a five-leg parlay for first touchdown scorers, with four legs covered Sunday; if Saquon Barkley scores the first TD in the Eagles-Packers game, the bet will pay $25,777.44. A $50 bet on five first-half touchdown scorers at FanDuel, boosted by a 25% profit boost, returned $30,395.69. A $250,000 moneyline bet on Notre Dame to beat Navy at -5000 odds paid $5,000 in profit. In a dramatic finish, a Jacksonville Jaguars +1.5 spread bet was lost after a fumble and a 32-yard defensive touchdown by Houston\u2019s Sheldon Rankins.

According to bet365, the Dodgers were -120 money line favorites, with an over/under of 7.5 total runs. SportsLine's projection model favored the Brewers (+105) to win in 56% of 10,000 simulations, significantly higher than the implied 48.1% probability from consensus odds. The model also predicted South Alabama (-7) would cover the spread against Arkansas State in 55% of simulations and Western Kentucky (-7.5) would cover against FIU 63% of the time. The model had a profitable record in 2025, with a 35-29 win rate on MLB money-line picks, nearly 30 units of profit on home run props, and over $2,000 in returns for $100 players on college football spreads since 2024. A three-leg parlay combining these picks would yield +647 odds ($100 to win $647). The Dodgers had won Game 1 2-1, but Los Angeles was just 1-9 in its past 10 meetings with Milwaukee. Freddy Peralta was set to start for the Brewers, having allowed two earned runs or fewer in four of his last five outings. Arkansas State had lost four of its past five games and nine of its last 11 road games, while Western Kentucky was 8-2 in its past 10 meetings with FIU and 9-1 in its last 10 home games. Western Kentucky ranked 34th nationally in red zone offense and was projected to score 35 points.

This decline, part of a broader 27% drop in visas issued to Indian students between March and May 2025 compared to 2024, is attributed to stricter visa policies under the Trump administration, including suspended interview slots, enhanced background checks (including social media scrutiny), rising processing fees, and tighter H-1B visa rules favoring higher-wage applicants. Indian students, who accounted for 27% of all international enrolments in U.S. universities in 2024, view the Optional Practical Training (OPT) and H-1B visa pathways as essential to their decision to study in the U.S., with a Forbes survey indicating that over half would not have enrolled if OPT were unavailable and 53% would not have applied if H-1B selection were based on wage levels. The decline threatens academic diversity and the financial stability of American universities, which rely heavily on international enrolments to offset stagnant domestic enrollment. Meanwhile, Canada, Australia, and the UK are gaining traction by offering clearer post-study work options and more predictable visa regimes. The article warns that unless current policies are reversed, the U.S. risks losing its status as the top destination for Indian students, with long-term consequences for higher education and the labor market. 'The dream of thousands of Indian students to study in the United States is losing its shine,' the article states, linking the downturn directly to 'tougher rules under the Trump administration.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 06:14 PM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/world/july-august-witness-50-drop-in-indian-students-heading-to-us-colleges-trump-s-visa-rules-to-blame-article-13596653.html)\n\n**I just won \u00a3550 on Premium\u00a0Bonds \u2014 but I\u2019m still ditching them**\nOn 23 September 2025 a 46\u2011year\u2011old mother of two recounts winning \u00a3550 on Premium Bonds, her biggest prize to date, but explains why she is considering ending her \u00a340,000 stake. She notes that the National Savings & Investments (NS&I) prize rate fell from 4.65\u202f% in September\u202f2023 to 3.6\u202f% in August\u202f2024, raising the odds of any prize to 22,000\u202fto\u202f1 versus 21,000\u202fto\u202f1, according to analyst Alice Haine. The article cites that a \u00a310,000 holding would earn an average of \u00a3360 per year, but offers no interest when no prize is won, meaning inflation erodes real value. It also reports that in September\u202f2024 more than 6\u202fmillion prizes worth over \u00a3397\u202fmillion were paid out, while the total number of bonds stood at 132,593,956,732. The author compares the \u00a34,300 won since 2020 with potential returns from fixed\u2011rate savings accounts, noting that a \u00a345,000 deposit in a 5\u2011year account at 1.55\u202f% would yield \u00a33,597, whereas a 2\u2011year account at 6.13\u202f% would yield \u00a35,686. She concludes that the lower prize rate and the lack of guaranteed interest make Premium Bonds less attractive, and she may move her money to a competitive savings account. \n\nQuotes: \n- 'The prize rate has fallen from 4.65 per cent in September 2023 to 3.6 per cent, with the odds of winning now at 22,000 to 1 vs 21,000 to 1.'\n- 'While savers wait for a win, they get no interest on their savings, so, without a prize, their cash loses value in real terms once inflation has been factored in.'\n- 'There\u2019s no escaping it: Premium Bonds don\u2019t pay interest.

Private colleges make up about 31% of all Chinese universities, including 388 ordinary undergraduate schools and 23 vocational schools.  In Guangdong, a private college reported a 5626\u2011person deficit after a second round of applications, and the Zhanjiang Technology Institute\u2019s 2025 plan of 9,086 undergraduates fell short by 2,150 (\u224824%) despite three rounds of recruitment that ultimately filled 76% of seats.  Fourteen of the 24 private undergrad schools in Guangdong had to hold supplemental enrollment to reach capacity.  The article notes that each round of recruitment in Guangdong saw score cuts of 10, 15, and 11 points, a practice mainly affecting private schools.  In Guangxi, some institutions announced a \u201cfourth round\u201d with no score cutoff, while Heilongjiang and Yunnan conducted five and six rounds, respectively.  Tuition for private colleges typically ranges from 30,000 to 50,000 yuan (\u22484,200\u20137,000 USD), higher than public institutions, and the total cost of a four\u2011year degree can reach 100,000\u2013200,000 yuan (\u224814,000\u201328,000 USD).  The article cites a 2025 nationwide high\u2011school enrollment of 13.35\u202fmillion, a decline of 70,000 from 2024, and a 2025 graduate cohort of 12.22\u202fmillion, up 430,000 from the previous year, highlighting a mismatch between supply and employment opportunities.  It also references the 1999 expansion of enrollment, which increased the number of students from 1.08\u202fmillion to 1.59\u202fmillion, and the subsequent rise in the gross enrollment rate to 60.8% in 2024, surpassing the 60% target set for the 14th Five\u2011Year Plan.  The piece concludes that the rapid expansion has led to a decline in the perceived value of university degrees and a growing \u201cundergraduate\u2011graduate imbalance.\u201d  Key quotes from the article include: \u201c'\u96f6\u6295\u6a94'\u201d, \u201c'\u53d6\u6d88\u5206\u6578\u7dda'\u201d, and \u201c'\u56db\u8f2a\u5fb5\u96c6'\u201d.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/8/28/n14582739.htm)\n\n**College World Series Odds: Track the Favorites to Win the 2025 CWS**\nThe 2025 College World Series (CWS) began on June 13 and will conclude by June 23, with the championship series between Coastal Carolina and LSU starting on June 21.

Unlike traditional fraud law (mens rea), which requires proof of intent, this new standard permits lawsuits even if the misrepresentation was unintentional\u2014such as a clerical error. This could expose universities, including public institutions like the University of Colorado at Boulder, to liability, potentially requiring taxpayer funding for refunds. The proposal arises amid concerns over rising student debt\u2014$1.2 trillion in 2015\u2014and low graduation rates, with less than 20% of full-time students at public four-year colleges earning degrees within four years. The article draws a parallel between education and consumer goods: just as consumers can return defective products like cars, TVs, or spoiled milk for refunds, students might reasonably expect a similar recourse if their degree fails to deliver promised outcomes, such as job placement in their field. The central question posed is whether college should come with a money-back guarantee, reflecting a broader debate about accountability, value, and consumer protection in higher education.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2016 08:34 AM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/08/26/should-college-come-with-a-money-back-guarantee.html)\n\n",

This exogenous shock is considered the most significant negative development, heavily weighing against Caplan's win.\n- Ongoing demographic headwinds\u2014fewer U.S. high school graduates reaching college age as the demographic 'cliff' arrives, further shrinking the pool of potential enrollees.\n- Perceived declining value of four-year college, with only 22% of Americans thinking a degree is worth it if financed with loans, potentially leading more domestic students to opt out.\n- Aggressive institutional countermeasures: Most analysts agree that U.S. four-year colleges have responded with extreme admissions flexibility\u2014including waivers, auto-admit, direct admission, financial aid expansion, and extended deadlines\u2014but generally doubt that these efforts can fully counterbalance both the international and demographic hits in a single year.\n\nA minority of experts (notably in Demographic Transition, Signaling Theory, and Status Attainment approaches) are more optimistic. They emphasize historical base-rate inertia, institutional adaptability, and possible overstatement of the impact of the international drop on the relevant 18-24 undergrad figures. Their projections (62-74% Caplan win) stress that four-year rates have typically proven resilient even in the face of shocks (e.g., COVID years) and that the denominator (total 18-24 year-olds) is also contracting.\n\nMost experts (from Education Studies, Sociology, Economics, US Social Policy, IPEDS/Data, and Demographic Analysis) judge the confluence of 2025's international shock with structural declines to be sufficiently powerful to put the enrollment rate at or just below the critical 26.6% line. They see Caplan's win probability as 22-40%. Only one forecast (Signaling Theory) places the win likelihood substantially above 50% (at 68%), with the others clustering between 22% and 40%.\n\nCommonly described No-outcome (Caplan loses) scenarios involve the 18-24 four-year rate dipping just below 26.6%, driven by a confluence of international collapse and weak domestic intake, with recruitment efforts unable to fully compensate. Yes-outcome (Caplan wins) scenarios posit unprecedented institutional adaptability, last-minute policy recovery on visas, or denominator shrinkage outpacing the loss of enrollees, keeping the rate just above the threshold.\n\nIn sum, while there is no unanimity, the weight of informed expert opinion, grounded in base rates and reactive institutional behavior, now favors Caplan losing his bet, with the probability of a win judged notably below 50% but not vanishingly small\u2014a near coin flip, but with odds now clearly against him due to the unique 2025 international student collapse.",
