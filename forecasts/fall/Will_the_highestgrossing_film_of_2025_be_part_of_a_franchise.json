Too often, analysts get bogged down in whether a film\u2019s narrative is part of a strict story universe, but the fine print here recognizes the reality: video game IP and remakes are essentially designed to be extensible brands. Your logic correctly elevates this to the operational level\u2014Ne Zha 2, Minecraft, Lilo & Stitch, and every other actual contender are undeniably franchise entries, whether by history or by intent. Moreover, your identification of the brand extension loop (studio incentive to pre-announce sequels, market as a brand, etc.) matches up perfectly with how actual Hollywood and international studio portfolios are being managed and why breakthrough originals are almost systematically out-funded and out-marketed at the global apex. The only aspect I would add is even more skepticism about the 'franchise fatigue' offset: as the year shows, even with genre rotation or temporary fatigue, top-grossers are structurally engineered as franchises now."

More importantly, your genre-based framework doesn't sufficiently account for the internationalization of the blockbuster\u2014the dominance of a Chinese sequel is not just a genre pivot but an industrial reconfiguration. Simply put: it's not merely genre resilience, it's a new global box office architecture anchored almost entirely in cross-category franchises, irrespective of the genre. Without this additional industrial insight, your theory risks sounding dated as the entire blockbuster mechanism has shifted from genre cycles to franchise cycles on a planetary scale."

Your theory underestimates just how rapidly the market replaces one franchise cohort with another, keeping original top-grossers rare. Moreover, with current data, there are zero credible mid- or late-cycle originals in the running. 'Maturation' and 'decline' phases in the life cycle of individual Hollywood properties mean little when the overall market pivots to a constantly renewing slate of international and cross-media franchises. The product cycle is now a perpetually self-replenishing machine for IP, not a cycle with meaningful disruption from originals."

Ne Zha 2 succeeded not only as a franchise, but because it activated Chinese domestic demand at a scale that neither Hollywood nor Bollywood nor any Western market could counter this year\u2014a clear informational advantage that could, in principle, bootstrap an original domestic hit elsewhere if the global cultural tide shifted. While unlikely, this is a more plausible 'No' scenario than your argument allows and does dock your conclusion some probabilistic nuance. You also underappreciate how digital marketing and global streaming have dropped the investment threshold for viral distribution\u2014making a true out-of-nowhere original slightly less impossible than during the vertically integrated, pre-pandemic box office era.

The article attributes the downturn to over\u2011extension of the franchise\u201411 superhero TV seasons between 2020\u20112024, a shift to a multiverse narrative mid\u2011Phase\u202f4, and a corporate push for Disney+ content\u2014leading to diluted brand quality. It cites Kevin Feige\u2019s admission that the 2014 announcement of the entire Phase\u202f3 slate backfired, drawing attention away from individual films: 'I think there was a slight notion of -- Ultron hadn't come out at that point and I felt a tiny little sense of, 'Well, gosh, we've gotta talk about the movies we have coming out next because that's what we've been working so hard on and that's what's next available for our audience to see,' but when we talk that far ahead, that took a lot of attention out.' The piece also notes that the MCU\u2019s decline is mirrored by a broader industry shift toward fresh, original content, as seen in 2025\u2019s hits like Sinners and Weapons. Despite the slump, the MCU remains culturally influential; upcoming releases such as Spider\u2011Man: Brand New Day and Avengers: Doomsday are expected to each break $1\u202fbillion, suggesting a \"less is more\" strategy could preserve profitability even if the franchise will not return to $5\u202fbillion\u2011year peaks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 05:33 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/why-marvel-cinematic-universe-still-matters/)\n\n**Ne\u202fZha\u202f2, the Most Box\u2011Office\u2011Successful Chinese Film, Debuts in Peru: Milestones of a Magical Cinema**\nThe article reports that the Chinese animated sequel \"Ne\u202fZha\u202f2: The Rebirth of the Soul\" (\u54ea\u5412\u4e4b\u9b54\u7ae5\u95f9\u6d77) has become the highest\u2011grossing Chinese film ever, surpassing the 2\u202fbillion\u2011dollar mark worldwide and overtaking titles such as \"Star\u202fWars: Episode\u202fVII\" and \"Frozen\u202fII\".

The change follows a record\u2011breaking red\u2011band trailer that became the most\u2011viewed of all time and placed the film as the second most anticipated movie of the fall, according to Fandango. The article notes that the original window would have positioned the film as the top\u2011grossing release on its opening weekend, with a two\u2011week run before the November\u202f7 release of Predator:\u202fBadlands, and that it would have likely topped the box office in its second week.

Titles released in 2025 such as 'Captain America: Brave New World', 'Thunderbolts', 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps', 'Superman', 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness', and 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.' all fell short of the $700\u202fmillion threshold, signaling a potential shift in the comic\u2011book movie machine.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[fortressofsolitude.co.za](https://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/2025-breaks-the-superhero-movie-box-office-streak/)\n\n**It Ruled The Box Office With $32B - Now Audiences Think It's Dead**\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has experienced a steep decline in box\u2011office revenue since the end of Phase\u202f3, with yearly grosses falling from $5.06\u202fbillion in 2019 to $1.31\u202fbillion in 2025, the lowest since 2019. The article attributes the downturn to over\u2011extension of the franchise\u201411 superhero TV seasons between 2020\u20112024, a shift to a multiverse narrative mid\u2011Phase\u202f4, and a corporate push for Disney+ content\u2014leading to diluted brand quality. It cites Kevin Feige\u2019s admission that the 2014 announcement of the entire Phase\u202f3 slate backfired, drawing attention away from individual films: 'I think there was a slight notion of -- Ultron hadn't come out at that point and I felt a tiny little sense of, 'Well, gosh, we've gotta talk about the movies we have coming out next because that's what we've been working so hard on and that's what's next available for our audience to see,' but when we talk that far ahead, that took a lot of attention out.' The piece also notes that the MCU\u2019s decline is mirrored by a broader industry shift toward fresh, original content, as seen in 2025\u2019s hits like Sinners and Weapons. Despite the slump, the MCU remains culturally influential; upcoming releases such as Spider\u2011Man: Brand New Day and Avengers: Doomsday are expected to each break $1\u202fbillion, suggesting a \"less is more\" strategy could preserve profitability even if the franchise will not return to $5\u202fbillion\u2011year peaks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 05:33 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/why-marvel-cinematic-universe-still-matters/)\n\n**Ne\u202fZha\u202f2, the Most Box\u2011Office\u2011Successful Chinese Film, Debuts in Peru: Milestones of a Magical Cinema**\nThe article reports that the Chinese animated sequel \"Ne\u202fZha\u202f2: The Rebirth of the Soul\" (\u54ea\u5412\u4e4b\u9b54\u7ae5\u95f9\u6d77) has become the highest\u2011grossing Chinese film ever, surpassing the 2\u202fbillion\u2011dollar mark worldwide and overtaking titles such as \"Star\u202fWars: Episode\u202fVII\" and \"Frozen\u202fII\".

Studios are increasingly relying on franchise films: 26 titles earned at least $20\u202fmillion in North America, 20 of which were part of established series.  However, many franchises performed worse than previous installments, with the *John\u202fWick* sequel starring Anna De\u202fArmas and Keanu Reeves cited as an example.  Disney\u2019s revival of *Lilo &\u202fStitch* and the *Fantastic\u202fFour* reboot are highlighted as successful franchise resurgences.

With a production budget of roughly $200\u202fmillion, the film is expected to have broken even and likely turned a modest profit once digital and streaming revenue are added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 31, 2025 05:24 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-500-million-global-box-office-milestone/)\n\n**The MCU Is About To Have an Unwanted Box Office Record for the First Time in 14 Years**\nAccording to the article, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has historically dominated the worldwide box office, with each new film after The Avengers breaking records and often surpassing $1\u202fbillion. However, the pandemic disrupted this trend. In 2025, the MCU released three films: Captain America: Brave New World ($415\u202fmillion worldwide), Thunderbolts ($382.4\u202fmillion worldwide), and Fantastic\u202fFour: The First Steps ($491\u202fmillion worldwide). None of these titles entered the worldwide top\u201110, marking the first time since 2011 that the MCU had no film in that bracket. The article notes that Brave New World and Fantastic\u202fFour are currently ranked 9th and 10th but will likely be overtaken by upcoming releases such as Wicked: For Good and Avatar: Fire and Ash. The author describes the situation as a 'hard fall' for the franchise, suggesting that the MCU may now be 'just another comic\u2011book franchise on the big screen.' Despite this downturn, the article remains optimistic, noting that future releases like Avengers: Doomsday could restore the MCU's former dominance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 31, 2025 01:36 PM\nSource:[Comicbook](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/marvel-cinematic-universe-box-office-record-2025-worldwide-top-10/)\n\n**2025 Breaks the Superhero Movie Box Office Streak**\nIn 2025, for the first time since 2011, no superhero film achieved a global box\u2011office gross of $700\u202fmillion or more, ending a 14\u2011year streak of blockbuster paydays. The article states that even major studios Marvel and DC \"couldn\u2019t hit the high\u2011water mark\" that had defined the genre. Titles released in 2025 such as 'Captain America: Brave New World', 'Thunderbolts', 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps', 'Superman', 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness', and 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.' all fell short of the $700\u202fmillion threshold, signaling a potential shift in the comic\u2011book movie machine.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[fortressofsolitude.co.za](https://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/2025-breaks-the-superhero-movie-box-office-streak/)\n\n**Highest Grossing Hollywood Movies Of 2025 On OTT: Where To Watch F1, Superman, Mission Impossible The Final Reckoning, Thunderbolts, A Minecraft Movie And More**\nThe article lists the highest\u2011grossing Hollywood releases of 2025 that are now available on OTT platforms, noting their box\u2011office performance and digital release details.

According to Scott Mendelson, a box office analyst, studios are focusing on sequels because a large segment of moviegoers have stopped attending, and sequels are an easy way to get their attention. However, massive budgets have led to mixed returns for films like 'Superman' and 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps.' Mendelson suggests that studios should prioritize original releases, citing Warner Bros.' 'Sinners' as an example, which has earned over $365 million. He also expressed concerns about the impact of shareholder expectations on creativity and artistic freedom.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 06:49 PM\nSource:[KYMA](https://kyma.com/news/2025/08/18/sequels-and-remakes-highlight-2025-summer-blockbuster-season/)\n\n**Hollywood box office 2025: Top 10 global hits smashing records -- from Ne Zha 2's rise to Fantastic Four's game-changing debut**\nThe top 10 global Hollywood box office hits of 2025 showcase a strong return to familiar franchises. Ne Zha 2 leads the pack with nearly $1.9 billion worldwide, followed by Lilo & Stitch with $1.025 billion.

Other notable films include How to Train Your Dragon, Mission: Impossible- The Final Reckoning, Superman, F1: The Movie, Fantastic Four, and Captain America: Brave New World. According to Box Office Mojo, these films demonstrate that audiences still love well-known stories, whether they come as sequels, reboots, or animated adventures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 12, 2025 06:17 PM\nSource:[IndiaTimes](https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hollywood-box-office-2025-top-10-global-hits-smashing-recordsfrom-ne-zha-2s-rise-to-fantastic-fours-game-changing-debut/articleshow/123263111.html)\n\n**Jurassic World Rebirth Outgrosses Two Superhero Blockbusters With Huge Global Box Office Milestone**\nJurassic World Rebirth has outperformed two major superhero movies, Thunderbolts* and Captain America: Brave New World, with a cumulative worldwide box office gross of $529 million as of Sunday morning. This is a huge boost from its global total as of Friday, which was $378.5 million. According to Variety, this makes it the sixth movie of 2025 to pass the $500 million global milestone. The reported budget of Jurassic World Rebirth is $180 million, the same as both Thunderbolts* and Captain America: Brave New World. While it remains to be seen how much higher it can climb up the worldwide box office chart for the year, it should quickly surge past How to Train Your Dragon and Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning. However, it is unlikely to beat the record-breaking $1.899 billion haul of Ne Zha 2 or reach the level of Lilo & Stitch or A Minecraft Movie. 'It should be able to keep climbing,' says the article, highlighting its current trajectory. Nevertheless, its current success will likely be quickly surpassed by newer summer movies such as Superman and Marvel's upcoming The Fantastic Four: First Steps.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 13, 2025 06:48 PM\nSource:[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-500-million-global-box-office-milestone/)\n\n**Hollywood Revives Iconic Films with New Installments**\nHollywood is revisiting its archives to produce new parts of successful films, a trend that has become common in recent years. This approach is driven by the need to reduce financial risks while capitalizing on the popularity of previous parts. Several iconic films are being revived, including 'The Devil Wears Prada' and 'The Princess Diaries'. The sequel to 'Face/Off' has been announced, with Nicolas Cage and John Travolta set to reprise their roles. Adam Wingard will direct and write the script, following his work on 'Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire'. Disney has confirmed plans to release a third installment of 'The Princess Diaries', with Anne Hathaway set to return as Mia Thermopolis. A new part of 'The Devil Wears Prada' is also in the works, with Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt set to reprise their roles. The film will focus on Miranda Priestly's struggles with declining magazine sales due to the rise of digital platforms and changing consumer behavior. Since 2020, superhero films have seen a decline in box office performance and critical acclaim, leading producers to rely on successful franchises. Marvel has announced two new Avengers films, 'Avengers: Doomsday' and 'Avengers: Secret Wars', with a release date of 2026 and 2027, respectively. Tom Cruise is set to return as Ethan Hunt in 'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning', the eighth installment of the franchise. Robert Downey Jr. will reprise his role as Sherlock Holmes after a 13-year hiatus, with a new film set to be released in the near future. 'Captain America: Brave New World' has been released, with a worldwide box office gross of over $415 million. Warner Bros. is set to release the sequel to 'The Batman', with Robert Pattinson set to reprise his role as the Caped Crusader. The third installment of 'Avatar' is set to be released in 2025, with a planned release date for the fourth and fifth installments in 2029 and 2031, respectively. 'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning' has been released, with a planned sequel to be released in the near future. 'Sherlock Holmes' is set to be released, with Robert Downey Jr. set to reprise his role after a 13-year hiatus.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 19, 2025 01:36 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/arts/2025/6/19/%d9%87%d9%88%d9%84%d9%8a%d9%88%d8%af-%d8%aa%d9%86%d8%a8%d8%b4-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%a3%d8%b1%d8%b4%d9%8a%d9%81%d9%87%d8%a7-%d8%a3%d8%ac%d8%b2%d8%a7%d8%a1-%d8%ac%d8%af%d9%8a%d8%af%d8%a9)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts unanimously forecast an extremely high probability that the highest-grossing film of 2025 will be part of a franchise. Their consensus is grounded in several core observations:\n\n1. Base Rate Dominance: Historically, franchise films have frequently topped the annual global box office, with roughly 75-80% of top-grossers in recent years being franchise entries. The only clear exceptions (e.g., 'Barbie') are rare and not poised for repetition in 2025.\n\n2. 2025 Box Office Data: As of early September, every top-earning film\u2014'Ne Zha 2' (a direct sequel and franchise film, with $2B+ gross), 'Lilo & Stitch' (remake/franchise, $1B+), 'Jurassic World Rebirth', 'A Minecraft Movie', and 'Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning'\u2014is franchise-based per the resolution criteria. No original/non-franchise film comes close to matching their grosses, with the leading original ('Sinners') well below $400M.\n\n3. Imminent Contenders: All remaining late-2025 films with plausible blockbuster potential (e.g., 'Avatar: Fire and Ash', 'Zootopia 2', 'Wicked: For Good', 'Toy Story 5') are also franchise entries. Thus, even if the current leader is overtaken, it will almost certainly be by another franchise film.\n\n4. Global Trends and Franchising Economics: Studios increasingly concentrate investments and marketing on franchise properties due to risk reduction, brand equity, and reliable international appeal, a trend that is now as prevalent in China as in Hollywood. The box office structure favors incumbent IP dominance\u2014blockbuster resources flow overwhelmingly to established brands.\n\n5. Franchise Fatigue Caveat: Although several experts acknowledge fatigue with some specific genres (notably superheroes), they note that this has not benefitted original films, but rather redistributed box office dominance to other franchise genres (animation, video game adaptations, Chinese epics, remakes).\n\n6. Possibility of Upset: All experts regard a non-franchise upset as a 'black swan'\u2014the only credible path to a 'No' is a totally unforeseen, original film achieving an extraordinary global phenomenon, overtaking $2B in a single quarter, for which there is no evidence in current tracking or news.\n\n7. Resolution Criteria: The broad definition of 'franchise' (including remakes, adaptations with announced sequels, cinematic universes) ensures that nearly all possible leaders qualify as franchise entries.\n\nForecasted probabilities reflect near-unanimous confidence, ranging from 97% to 99% ('Ne Zha 2' or another franchise film essentially locked in as victor barring unprecedented events). Experts cite empirical data, industry logic, and current earnings to justify this near-certainty. There is virtually no signal supporting an original film break-out of sufficient scale. \n\nIn summary, the expert group converges on a highly confident prediction: The highest-grossing film of 2025 will almost certainly be part of a franchise."
