The ICC warrant, while diplomatically embarrassing, has zero direct legal consequence and, if anything, strengthens his argument to loyalists of being unfairly targeted. The coalition shows little sign of imminent collapse; hard-right partners are deeply invested in his tenure, and elite alternatives are weak and fragmented. While a sudden health incident or black swan could upend this, all major indicators suggest survival through the end of 2025 is more likely than not, though with much instability and noise. Public/elite moves for early elections are possible late this year, but would almost certainly not result in removal before January. Base rates of mid-year PM removals in Israel are low.

            "yes_scenario": "Despite constant legal and political turbulence, Netanyahu's government holds together through the end of 2025; coalition partners remain too divided or fearful of elections to break ranks. Early elections are either not held, or (less likely) held late enough that formation of a new government bleeds into 2026. Alternatively, Netanyahu survives as caretaker/transition PM until a successor can be appointed in January 2026, or wins elections despite negative polls due to opposition fragmentation.",
            "final_reasoning": "From the perspective of legitimacy theory, Netanyahu is operating under a dual crisis: his legal-institutional legitimacy is damaged (but not terminal, given Israeli legal timelines and the difficulty of conviction and appeal within months), and his sociopolitical legitimacy is severely depleted (public trust is exceedingly low, coalition is brittle, and regime stability depends on constant crisis management). The primary mechanism for removal remains domestic: early elections or coalition revolt. Historically, embattled Israeli PMs can survive immense scandals and international pressure if skilled in coalition management (see Olmert, Barak, Begin), but when elite and public legitimacy evaporates simultaneously\u2014as reflected in elite predictions, polling, and widespread protest\u2014removal or forced resignation becomes highly probable, especially after the acute phase of existential threat fades. Multiple recent news articles reference widespread elite and public consensus that Netanyahu 'cannot and should not survive' as PM, and credible predictions from established analysts (e.g., Benny Morris) expect elections by October\u2013November 2025. Empirically, the base rate for PMs staying a full year after this degree of sustained crisis is quite low. The only strong counterweight is the tendency of Israeli politics to stall; elections could arrive late enough that transition to a new PM occurs in early January. Given the balance of legal delays, coalition inertia, and the overwhelming sociopolitical pressure for change, the most likely scenario is that Netanyahu ceases to be Prime Minister at some point before Dec 31, 2025\u2014probability is thus below even odds, but not drastically so, reflecting both elite fractiousness and Israeli institutional inertia. I forecast a 40% probability Netanyahu remains PM for all of 2025.",

Likud inertia, the transaction costs of coalition betrayal, and the self-preservation instinct among far-right and ultra-Orthodox factions facing bleak polls create a high status-quo bias. Even elite consensus that 'Netanyahu\u2019s time is ending' does not translate into rapid collective action\u2014especially before transition periods like Hanukkah and with the divisive war semi-frozen in place. Yes, this is a uniquely volatile and illegitimate period, but Israeli history is replete with PMs stumbling onward after being widely written off.

Your own base rate analysis admits Israeli parties and PMs ride out much deeper legitimacy crises when expulsion means losing leverage or risking electoral disaster, as is the case for Netanyahu's partners.

The original question opened on 2024-12-20 21:01:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/31118). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n[Benjamin Netanyahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu) is the Prime Minister of Israel as of December 2024, since the end of 2022, having previously held the office from 1996 to 1999 and again from 2009 to 2021. Netanyahu is the longest-tenured prime minister in the country's history, having served for a total of over 17 years.\n\nThroughout 2024, Netanyahu's leadership has faced significant challenges, including [ongoing corruption trials](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g30271wxwo) and international legal actions. In November 2024, the International Criminal Court [issued an arrest warrant](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges) for Netanyahu, alleging war crimes committed during the Israel\u2013Hamas conflict. Despite these legal issues, Netanyahu has maintained his position as Prime Minister. Israeli law [permits a prime minister](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-corruption-trial-divides-israeli-public-2024-12-09/) to remain in office unless convicted and after all appeals are exhausted.\n\nPublic opinion has been divided regarding Netanyahu's tenure. In July 2024, [a poll showed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-finds-72-of-israelis-think-netanyahu-should-quit-over-oct-7-failures/) that 72% of Israelis think Netanyahu should quit over the security failures that led to the Hamas attacks in October 2023.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

He faces three separate charges: accepting over $260,000 in luxury goods\u2014including champagne, cigars, and jewelry\u2014from billionaires in exchange for political favors; and attempting to secure favorable media coverage from two Israeli outlets. Netanyahu denies all allegations, claiming he is the victim of a political conspiracy. His appearance followed the return of hostages taken by Hamas under a U.S.-brokered plan and came amid U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s public suggestion on October 13, 2025, that Netanyahu should be pardoned, joking, 'Cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?' Trump also urged Israeli President Isaac Herzog to grant a pardon. Netanyahu is also subject to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on suspicion of ordering war crimes during Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. The prime minister, who has served 18 years in total across multiple terms since 1996, has proposed sweeping judicial reforms during his current term (starting late 2022), which triggered large-scale protests that subsided after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

Despite a lighthearted suggestion by former U.S. President Donald Trump during his address to the Knesset for Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, Morris emphasized that public sentiment remains overwhelmingly negative, with most Israelis believing Netanyahu should not be prime minister, lacks honesty, and is ineffective. Morris criticized Netanyahu for failing to prevent the October 7 attacks and for blaming Israel\u2019s military and intelligence agencies afterward, calling his conduct 'total incompetence.' He predicted that Israel will hold elections by October 2025, with opinion polls indicating Netanyahu would lose if he leads Likud. Netanyahu is currently on trial in three corruption cases\u2014Cases 1000, 2000, and 4000\u2014accused of bribery, fraud, breach of trust, receiving expensive gifts, and offering regulatory favors, which he denies as politically motivated.

The trial unfolded amid heightened tensions, with supporters from his Likud party applauding him and angry protesters chanting slogans against him. The proceedings coincided with efforts by former U.S. President Donald Trump to grant Netanyahu a pardon, following a ceasefire agreement brokered by Trump that facilitated the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The first case centers on Netanyahu and his wife Sara receiving luxury gifts valued at over $260,000\u2014such as champagne, cigars, and jewelry\u2014from wealthy individuals in exchange for political favors. The other two cases involve allegations that Netanyahu sought favorable media coverage through two Israeli media outlets, raising charges of corruption and influence over public opinion. In parallel, Netanyahu has pushed for sweeping judicial reforms since returning to power in late 2022, a move critics argue aims to weaken the judiciary, while he claims it is necessary for judicial efficiency. Public protests against these reforms temporarily subsided after Hamas\u2019s October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the Gaza war, effectively pausing domestic debate. Trump, in a speech at the Israeli Knesset, gave Netanyahu a temporary approval to oversee security in Gaza post-ceasefire and humorously remarked, 'Who cares about cigars and champagne?' before urging Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu.

The charges include fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate cases, one of which involves allegations that Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, accepted over $260,000 in luxury goods\u2014including champagne, cigars, and jewellery\u2014from billionaires in exchange for political favours. He is also accused of attempting to secure favourable media coverage from two Israeli outlets. Netanyahu denies all charges, claiming he is the victim of a political plot to remove an elected right-wing leader. The trial has been repeatedly interrupted due to two years of war and regional upheaval, including the Israel-Hamas war that began on October 7, 2023, after a Hamas attack killed 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostages. In response, Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza, during which over 67,000 Palestinians have been reported killed, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry, which includes both civilians and combatants, with about half being women and children. The trial is ongoing, with no ruling yet issued. U.S. President Donald Trump, during a speech to the Knesset on October 13, 2025, jokingly suggested that Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog pardon Netanyahu, saying, 'Cigars and some champagne \u2014 who the hell cares?' Trump referred to Netanyahu as 'one of the great wartime presidents' and emphasized his popularity, adding, 'You know how to win.' Trump had previously called for the trial to be cancelled in June 2025. Netanyahu also faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Netanyahu holds the record for the most time served as Israel\u2019s prime minister, with 18 years across multiple terms since 1996.

The session was attended by several members of the ruling Likud party, including ministers and Knesset members, showing public support. During the session, Netanyahu briefly left the courtroom after receiving an envelope from an aide. Outside, his motorcade was met with protests from angry demonstrators, though he remained calm and composed. The resumption of the trial coincided with growing political calls for his pardon, following a public appeal by former U.S. President Donald Trump to Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday. Under Israeli law, the president has the authority to grant pardons or reduce sentences based on recommendations from relevant bodies. Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Education Minister Yoav Kisch, both from Likud, supported the calls, calling the trial 'unfair' and harmful to national interests, with Kisch arguing that 'the country faces existential security threats that warrant dropping the case.' Netanyahu faces three corruption cases known as 'Cases 1000, 2000, and 4000.' Case 1000 involves allegations that Netanyahu and his wife Sara received luxury gifts worth over $260,000 from businessmen in exchange for political favors. Case 2000 concerns alleged collusion with the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth for favorable media coverage. Case 4000, considered the most serious, accuses Netanyahu of granting regulatory benefits to businessman Shaul Elovitch, owner of Bezeq and news site Walla, in exchange for positive media coverage. The trial began in May 2020 and is the first in Israel\u2019s history to involve a sitting prime minister. In addition, Netanyahu is under an ICC arrest warrant for alleged war crimes during Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, which resulted in approximately 68,000 Palestinian deaths since October 2023\u2014mostly women and children. The ICC issued arrest warrants in November 2024 against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for 'committing atrocities against civilians' in Gaza. Netanyahu is Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, with a total of 18 years in office across non-consecutive terms since 1996.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:29 PM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5264981)\n\n**Netanyahu in court for graft trial appearance | Macau Business**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared in a Tel Aviv court on October 15, 2025, for the latest hearing in his ongoing corruption trial, which began in May 2020.

The charges include fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate cases, one of which involves allegations that Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, accepted over $260,000 in luxury goods\u2014including champagne, cigars, and jewellery\u2014from billionaires in exchange for political favours. He is also accused of attempting to secure favourable media coverage from two Israeli outlets. Netanyahu denies all charges, claiming he is the victim of a political plot to remove an elected right-wing leader. The trial has been repeatedly interrupted due to two years of war and regional upheaval, including the Israel-Hamas war that began on October 7, 2023, after a Hamas attack killed 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostages. In response, Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza, during which over 67,000 Palestinians have been reported killed, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry, which includes both civilians and combatants, with about half being women and children. The trial is ongoing, with no ruling yet issued. U.S. President Donald Trump, during a speech to the Knesset on October 13, 2025, jokingly suggested that Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog pardon Netanyahu, saying, 'Cigars and some champagne \u2014 who the hell cares?' Trump referred to Netanyahu as 'one of the great wartime presidents' and emphasized his popularity, adding, 'You know how to win.' Trump had previously called for the trial to be cancelled in June 2025. Netanyahu also faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Netanyahu holds the record for the most time served as Israel\u2019s prime minister, with 18 years across multiple terms since 1996. His current government is also under scrutiny for judicial reforms proposed during his term, which sparked massive protests before the war began.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15194259/Benjamin-Netanyahu-appears-court-face-corruption-charges-Trump-told-Knesset-Cigars-champagne-hell-cares-dont-you-pardon.html)\n\n**Netanyahu arrives in court for graft trial**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared in a Tel Aviv court on October 15, 2025, for the latest hearing in his ongoing corruption trial, which began in May 2020. He was greeted by protesters during his arrival, despite maintaining a smiling demeanor alongside several Likud party ministers. The trial involves three separate cases: one alleging that Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, accepted over $260,000 in luxury goods\u2014such as champagne, cigars, and jewelry\u2014from billionaires in exchange for political favors; two others accusing him of attempting to secure favorable media coverage from Israeli outlets. Netanyahu denies all charges, claiming he is the victim of a political conspiracy. The court appearance followed the return of hostages taken by Hamas under a U.S.-brokered plan facilitated by former President Donald Trump. Trump, during a recent address to the Israeli Knesset, jokingly dismissed the luxury goods allegations\u2014'Cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?'\u2014and urged Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu. Netanyahu also faces an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant over alleged war crimes during Israel\u2019s military operations against Hamas in Gaza. He holds the record for the most cumulative years as Israel\u2019s prime minister, with 18 years across multiple terms since 1996. His current term, beginning in late 2022, has been marked by controversial judicial reforms that triggered large-scale protests, which subsided only after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2025/10/15/netanyahu-arrives-in-court-for-graft-trial)\n\n**Israel Resumes Netanyahu's Trial Amid Diplomatic and Legal Developments**\nThe trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will resume on Wednesday, October 15, 2025, with Netanyahu set to testify before the Jerusalem District Court between 12:30 PM and 5:00 PM, as confirmed by a court ruling issued on Monday. The session was previously postponed due to diplomatic meetings, including one with Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and another with an undisclosed individual, which Netanyahu\u2019s legal team requested be accommodated.

The flight path was reportedly chosen to sidestep the airspace of countries that are signatories to the Rome Statute and could enforce an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant issued in November\u202f2024 for Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav\u202fGallant on allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity related to Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza.

The session was temporarily halted for 40 minutes after Netanyahu received a \"security\u2011related memorandum\" from his office, according to the Israeli Channel 12, before he resumed the hearing. He faces charges of corruption, bribery and abuse of office in three high\u2011profile cases, known as files \"1000\", \"2000\" and \"4000\". File 1000 alleges that Netanyahu and family members accepted valuable gifts from businessmen in exchange for facilitation; file 2000 accuses him of negotiating with the Hebrew newspaper publisher Aron Mosess for favorable coverage; and file 4000 involves providing facilitation to former owner of the Israeli news site \"Walla\" for positive media treatment. The trial began in 2020, and Netanyahu denies the allegations, claiming they are a \"political campaign to overthrow him\". In addition, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on November 21, 2024, charging Netanyahu with war crimes and crimes against humanity for actions in Gaza. The article reports that since the Israeli offensive began on October 7, 2023, Israel has killed 64,656 Palestinians, injured 163,503, and displaced hundreds of thousands, with 404 Palestinians, including 141 children, reported dead from starvation.

The court session was temporarily suspended for 40 minutes after Netanyahu received a security\u2011related memorandum from his office, after which he returned to testify. This is the second consecutive day that Netanyahu appears before the court following a month\u2011long break due to the summer recess. He faces accusations in three major corruption files: the \"1000 file\" involves gifts received by Netanyahu and family members from businessmen in exchange for facilitation; the \"2000 file\" alleges negotiations with a Hebrew newspaper publisher for favorable coverage; and the \"4000 file\" concerns facilitation for a former owner of an Israeli news site in return for positive media. The trial began in 2020, and Netanyahu denies the allegations, claiming they are a political campaign to oust him.\n\nIn addition, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on 21 November 2024 for Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the Gaza conflict. The article notes that Israel, with U.S. support, has been conducting a genocide in Gaza since 7 October 2023, involving killing, starvation, destruction, and forced displacement, despite international calls and ICC orders to halt. The alleged genocide has resulted in 64,656 deaths, 163,503 injuries, and 404 Palestinians killed, of whom 141 were children.\n\nQuotes from the article include: '\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641 1000', '\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641 2000', and '\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641 4000'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 01:10 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/9/10/%d9%86%d8%aa%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a7%d9%87%d9%88-%d9%8a%d9%85%d8%ab%d9%84-%d8%a3%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%85%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b1%d9%83%d8%b2%d9%8a%d8%a9)\n\n**With eyes on re-election, Netanyahu's fights with world leaders aim to distract from his many political problems**\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest\u2011serving prime minister for 17 years, has used a mix of political manoeuvring and public posturing to keep his far\u2011right coalition intact while preparing for the 2026 elections.  The article notes that he has \"managed to neutralise almost all immediate domestic threats to his power\" (article) and that he has \"clashed with Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, who argued against the plan to expand the war into Gaza City\" (article).  Zamir received clear messages to fold or resign, yet \"chose to stay\" (article).  Netanyahu has faced \"hundreds of thousands of people taking part in marches in support of a hostage deal\" and criticism from former senior politicians and ex\u2011security officials (article).  He has acceded to hard\u2011right ministers Ben\u202fGvir and Smotrich, rejecting ceasefire agreements with Hamas and ordering increased military action to achieve what he has called a \"total victory\" (article).  He has also \"indulged Ben\u202fGvir and Smotrich\u2019s talk of resettling Gaza\" and \"enabled their moves to gradually expand Israeli settlements deeper into the West Bank\" (article).  The article reports that Netanyahu has \"angrily rebuked the wave of Western countries recognising, or preparing to recognise, a Palestinian state\" (article) and that his defiant letters to French President Emmanuel Macron and social media outbursts about Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese are aimed at cultivating his image as \"a strong leader for Israel\" among his base (article).  He has also \"felt confident attacking the ICC for issuing warrants against him\" (article).  Netanyahu\u2019s strategy is framed as a distraction from his ongoing trial on bribery and breach of trust charges and from the question of whether to accept a ceasefire that could risk losing his coalition (article).  The article concludes that he is weighing three options: a ceasefire that could win public approval but risk coalition collapse, a continued military operation that could endanger hostages, or a hybrid approach that escalates while negotiating (article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 04:52 AM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/with-eyes-on-re-election-netanyahus-fights-with-world-leaders-aim-to-distract-from-his-many-political-problems-263523)\n\n**Trump Calls Netanyahu a 'War Hero' Amid ICC Arrest Warrant**\nUS President Donald Trump has referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a 'war hero' after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Trump stated in a radio interview with Mark Levin, 'He's a good man. He's fighting. He's a war hero because we worked together. He's a war hero. I think I am too.' Trump did not clarify whether he was referring to the ICC's arrest warrant or Netanyahu's corruption trial in Israel. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on November 21, 2024, for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu is also facing corruption charges in Israel, which Trump had previously called for to be dropped. The Israeli military has launched attacks on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, resulting in the deaths of at least 62,644 Palestinians and injuring 156,573 others. Israel's Security Cabinet approved a plan to occupy the Gaza Strip on August 8, with Netanyahu stating that they aim to occupy the entire territory. However, reports prior to the cabinet meeting suggested that the occupation would be carried out in stages, starting with the city of Gaza and then expanding to the refugee camps in the middle of the territory.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 05:42 AM\nSource:[H\u00fcrriyet](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/trumptan-savas-suclarindan-hakkinda-tutuklama-karari-cikarilan-netanyahu-icin-kahraman-nitelemesi-42920154)\n\n**Netanyahu Begins Security Consultations Ahead of 'Crucial Decisions' on Gaza**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has begun security consultations in preparation for 'crucial decisions' regarding the ongoing war in Gaza. According to Israeli Channel 12, Netanyahu has started intensive security meetings to make 'crucial decisions' about Gaza, with a limited number of ministers in attendance. The meetings come amid reports of Israel's intention to reoccupy Gaza in its entirety, which it previously occupied for 38 years from 1967 to 2005. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been waging a genocidal war in Gaza, including killing, starving, destroying, and forcibly displacing Palestinians, ignoring international calls and orders from the International Criminal Court to stop. The war has resulted in over 211,000 Palestinian casualties, with most being children and women, and over 9,000 missing, in addition to hundreds of thousands of displaced people and a famine that has killed many, including dozens of children. In a previous statement, Netanyahu was quoted as saying, 'It was a great day.' However, it is unclear what he meant by this statement. The Israeli government has been criticized for its handling of the war, with 52% of Israelis holding the government responsible for not reaching an agreement with Hamas, according to a recent poll. Hamas has repeatedly offered to release Israeli prisoners in exchange for an end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The Israeli opposition and families of prisoners have accused Netanyahu of seeking partial deals that would allow the war to continue, ensuring his stay in power. Netanyahu is facing corruption charges that could lead to his imprisonment, and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel has occupied Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon for decades, refusing to withdraw and establish a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem, on the pre-1967 borders.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 05, 2025 04:31 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84/%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A3-%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%80%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A3%D9%86-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9/3651335)\n\n**Netanyahu's Leadership Under Fire as War in Gaza Continues**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been facing a significant challenge to his leadership after his decision to resume military operations in Gaza, which has led to a decline in his popularity. Despite his recent military success against Iran, Netanyahu's approval ratings have not recovered, and he is now considering calling for early elections to secure another term as Prime Minister. However, this move could be a risk, as many Israelis are calling for an end to the war in Gaza and the release of the remaining Israeli prisoners. A recent poll showed that 59% of Israelis want to stop the war in Gaza now, and 49% believe that Netanyahu's continued involvement in the war is due to his own political interests. Professor Tamar Hermann, a leading Israeli democracy researcher, says that Netanyahu is a skilled politician, but his lack of trust among the Israeli public is a major issue. A new poll is expected to show that less than 50% of Israelis trust Netanyahu completely or partially. The professor warns that calling for early elections could be a greater risk for Netanyahu than attacking Iran, as the Middle East is unpredictable. Netanyahu is also facing a major challenge in the form of a high-profile corruption trial, which is set to begin next week. The trial is related to allegations of bribery and fraud, and many Israelis are calling for Netanyahu's removal from office. The US President Donald Trump has weighed in on the issue, calling Netanyahu a 'great hero' and 'warrior', and urging the Israeli court to drop the charges against him. However, many Israelis have criticized Trump's intervention as 'unwise and unjust'. The professor Hermann has described Trump's move as 'treating us like banana republics'. The Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has also criticized Trump's intervention, saying that the US President should not interfere in Israel's internal affairs. The international community is also critical of Netanyahu's handling of the war in Gaza, with many accusing him of damaging Israel's international reputation and economic prospects. The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, charging them with war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The Israeli government has rejected these charges, but the ICC is still pursuing the case.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 09:41 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_publicaffairs/details/2025/6/29/2812234/%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%8A%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%B4%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A3%D9%8A-)\n\n**Will the War with Iran Save Netanyahu Politically?**\nIn November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including using hunger as a weapon against civilian populations in Gaza in response to Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. In April, the execution of the warrant was suspended due to Israel's raised concerns about the ICC's jurisdiction in the case, although it was not formally withdrawn.

    "summary": "Across diverse expert perspectives, most forecasters assess Benjamin Netanyahu is more likely than not to remain Prime Minister of Israel throughout all of 2025, but with non-trivial risk of removal before year\u2019s end. Those forecasting continued tenure (final probabilities: 83%, 91%, 68%, 88%, 85%, 92%, 85%) emphasize Israel\u2019s slow legal process (Netanyahu can only be forced out if convicted and all appeals exhausted, which is highly unlikely by December), formidable coalition logic (partners are incentivized to delay elections, which polls say they\u2019d lose), Netanyahu\u2019s mastery of coalition management, and an absence of immediate health crises or internal Likud revolt. While legal proceedings, ICC warrants, severe unpopularity, and ongoing mass protests are noted as destabilizing, historical precedence and current coalition incentives make ouster improbable in the short window remaining.\n\nConversely, a minority of experts (two at 40%) judge removal slightly more likely than survival, citing the unprecedented scale of public antipathy, deep coalition fragility, credible speculation or precedent for snap elections in late 2025, and a 'crisis of legitimacy'\u2014all potentially triggering elite defection, coalition collapse, or pre-election ouster, especially if new shocks emerge. Their analyses point to Israeli base rates of PM turnover after scandals or legitimacy collapses, and the real possibility that elections are called, resulting in Netanyahu\u2019s loss or replacement before year\u2019s end. Even among these skeptics, the probability Netanyahu survives is not much lower than 50%.\n\nAll experts agree: the legal avenue for removal is glacial; the main risks are sudden coalition fracture, elite repositioning ahead of likely electoral defeat, unexpected health crisis, or an extraordinary political shock. ICC and international pressure have little direct effect. The consensus (apart from two dissenters) is that inertia, legal protection, coalition interest, and Netanyahu's own tactical skill make his survival into 2026 somewhat more likely\u2014but with historic instability, this is far from certain as 2025 draws to a close.",
