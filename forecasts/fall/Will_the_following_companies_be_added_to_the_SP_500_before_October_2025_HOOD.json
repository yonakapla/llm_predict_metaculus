The question hinges solely on the formal announcement, not on underlying competitive forces or business model fitness\u2014both of which, while helpful in justifying an inclusion decision at the index committee level, are irrelevant to whether the inclusion has actually been announced and thus satisfies the forecast's resolution criteria.

Streamlining the rationale to focus exclusively on the public, official nature of the announcement and the historical base rate of post-announcement reversals (near zero) would further strengthen this forecast\u2019s explanatory power."

Even though such cases have not arisen for blue-chip additions and almost never after multi-channel dissemination, a full process audit sometimes unearths overlooked edge cases (for example, the brief post-announcement reversals occurring due to late-breaking SEC or audit flags). Including a short nod to how such changes would not impact this question, due to the fine print, would emphasize that the 'Yes' outcome is robust to any conceivable non-catastrophic scenario.

The resolution is strictly procedural: it is satisfied by a public and official announcement by S&P Dow Jones Indices; underlying firm competitiveness, threat of entrants, supply chain dynamics, and sector rivalry are not germane to resolving this subquestion. Introducing such strategic business analysis, while academically interesting, risks diluting the clarity of the forecast and could give undue weight to factors that are irrelevant for determining the presence or absence of the qualifying announcement. A sharper focus on announcement documentation, historical reversal base rates (near zero), and exclusion of post-announcement business developments would result in an even more compelling and defensible prediction."

Instead, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP), Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) and Emcor Group (NYSE:EME) would join the index. Analysts cited heavy reliance on Bitcoin, the fact that Strategy had only one full year of GAAP profitability, and the committee\u2019s cautious history as possible reasons for the exclusion. Benchmark\u2019s Mark Palmer said 'the exclusion reflected the committee\u2019s cautious stance rather than Strategy\u2019s balance sheet', adding that the company remains a strong contender for future inclusion if profits hold. Jeff Walton of Strive Funds noted that Strategy\u2019s Q2 profits were 6.6 times higher than the three added firms combined and 2.5 times greater over the past year, making its exclusion difficult to justify. After the announcement, MSTR fell 1.78% to $329.90, while Robinhood surged 15.8% to $117.28.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 07:05 PM\nSource:[ValueWalk](https://www.valuewalk.com/news/strategy-snubbed-as-robinhood-emcor-applovin-join-sp-500/)\n\n**Strategy Misses S&P 500 Inclusion This Month: Will It Ever Make the Cut?**\nThe article reports that Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) was omitted from the S&P 500 during the latest index rebalancing, while AppLovin (APP), Robinhood (HOOD), and Emcor (EME) were added.

The committee\u2019s decision is confidential, and the article notes that the committee added several bitcoin\u2011owning firms to the index this year, suggesting Strategy could be included in a future rebalancing if a spot opens. The piece cites Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who estimates $22\u202ftrillion is tied to S&P\u2011500\u2011based products, and Stephens, which projected that fund managers would need to purchase about 50\u202fmillion Strategy shares worth roughly $16\u202fbillion if the company were added. Strategy\u2019s $10\u202fbillion profit from bitcoin price gains in the last quarter is highlighted as evidence of its eligibility.

According to CME FedWatch, the probability of a 75\u2011basis\u2011point cut by December rose to 69.3% from 65.3% the previous day.\n\nInvestors are now focused on the upcoming August Producer Price Index (PPI) on the 11th and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 12th, as a sharp inflation rebound could slow the pace of cuts. \"If inflation does not rise sharply this week, the Fed\u2019s cut is essentially confirmed,\" said Chris Larkin of iTrade, adding that the market will likely remain cautious until the CPI release.\n\nTech stocks showed mixed performance: Nvidia (+0.77%), Amazon (+1.51%), and Microsoft (+0.65%) gained modestly, while Apple (\u20110.76%), Meta (\u20110.02%), Alphabet (\u20110.34%), and Tesla (\u20111.27%) fell. Broadcom (+3.21%) and Palantir (+1.95%) continued to rally.\n\nIndividual stocks surged on index\u2011inclusion news: Robinhood jumped 15.83% and Apple\u2011Robinhood 11.59% after being added to the S&P\u202f500.

The committee\u2019s decision is confidential, and the article notes that the committee added several bitcoin\u2011owning firms to the index this year, suggesting Strategy could be included in a future rebalancing if a spot opens. The piece cites Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who estimates $22\u202ftrillion is tied to S&P\u2011500\u2011based products, and Stephens, which projected that fund managers would need to purchase about 50\u202fmillion Strategy shares worth roughly $16\u202fbillion if the company were added. Strategy\u2019s $10\u202fbillion profit from bitcoin price gains in the last quarter is highlighted as evidence of its eligibility.

The update adds AppLovin Corp. (APP), Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), and Emcor Group Inc. (EME) to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), and Enphase Energy (ENPH), which will move to smaller\u2011cap indexes.

If the company were accepted, passive index\u2011tracking funds would need to purchase roughly 50\u202fmillion shares, creating an estimated $16\u202fbillion inflow at current market prices.  The S&P\u202f500 committee evaluates liquidity, profitability, trading history, and sector balance; it requires a minimum market capitalization of $22.7\u202fbillion and positive income for the current and past four quarters.  Strategy\u2019s market cap exceeds $90\u202fbillion, comfortably above the threshold.  The technology sector dominates the index, and recent additions such as Coinbase Global and Block (founded by Jack\u202fDorsey) signal growing recognition of digital assets.  Melissa Roberts, managing director at Stephens, noted that \u2018If someone is a big player in the space, it\u2019s hard to ignore them.\u2019  Nonetheless, skepticism remains about the sustainability of Strategy\u2019s corporate\u2011treasury model, which raises capital through debt and equity to acquire Bitcoin.  Shares fell 17\u202f% in August, eroding the premium over Bitcoin holdings, and the 30\u2011day price volatility reached 96\u202f%, higher than that of Nvidia or Tesla, potentially raising red flags for the committee.  Although Strategy was included in the Nasdaq\u202f100 last December, the S&P\u202f500 is larger, with nearly $10\u202ftrillion tied to passive strategies.

No changes were made during the quarterly rebalancing in June, despite speculation that online brokerage Robinhood (HOOD) could be added. The S&P 500 is managed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which sets the criteria for inclusion. Key criteria include market value, with the most valuable companies accounting for the largest percentage of the index. Currently, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) account for roughly 20% of the S&P 500.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 01:37 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

    "summary": "All forecasting experts unanimously agree, with near-total confidence, that Robinhood (HOOD) will be resolved as a 'Yes' to having been announced for addition to the S&P 500 before October 1, 2025. Every expert\u2014regardless of disciplinary lens (index eligibility, investment banking, capital markets, finance, economics, or business strategy)\u2014notes that multiple reputable sources, including direct announcements from S&P Dow Jones Indices and top financial news outlets (Bloomberg, Benzinga, Yahoo! Finance, CoinDesk, ValueWalk, Seeking Alpha, etc.), confirm the official announcement of HOOD's inclusion as of September 22, 2025. The experts carefully examine the resolution criteria and fine print, which specify that only an official announcement (not the actual, effective addition nor any subsequent retraction) is needed to resolve 'Yes.' Several scenarios for a 'No' outcome are dismissed as virtually impossible, requiring either a complete collapse of reliable financial news reporting or an unprecedented pre-deadline retraction (with the fine print explicitly stating that such retractions post-announcement do not affect resolution). The probability assigned by all forecasters is either 99% or 100%, reflecting this overwhelming evidence and total absence of contrary information. In sum, the consensus is that, barring the highly implausible, the outcome is as close to certain as possible: HOOD has been officially announced for S&P 500 inclusion and will resolve 'Yes' per the question's rules.",
