Motions to dismiss have only just been denied; discovery is outstanding, class certification (if pursued) has not been resolved, and damages calculation would require significant further proceedings. Historically, massive technology copyright cases take years from filing to final judgment. While settlement pressure is high, the question demands a judicially ordered payout or fine, not a negotiated agreement.

OpenAI/Microsoft) is post-motion to dismiss but nowhere near trial or substantive damages phase, with all signs (from docket history, standard timelines, and strategic interests on both sides) favoring continued litigation or a pre-final-judgment settlement. Judges almost never issue enormous damage awards before completing discovery, class certification, and expert analysis, and appeals often stay or shrink such awards for years\u2014especially in new, unsettled areas like AI/copyright. No news indicates a case remotely close to a final, court-imposed $100M+ payout before the deadline.

However, the overwhelming pattern in US legal (particularly copyright) history\u2014and especially in high-value, high-stakes tech IP lawsuits in the last decade\u2014is that major companies settle before final damages/judgment almost every time, to control liability and avoid precedent. Even after motions to dismiss are denied and discovery proceeds apace, it remains rare for a marquee case to complete class certification, discovery, summary judgment, trial, and post-trial motions to a $100M+ direct court order within a matter of months. Notably, even in supportive venues with high plaintiff success rates and activist judges, the system heavily biases settlement for systemic reasons: risk aversion by boards/investors, the appealability of massive damages, and the uncertainty in measuring 'actual harm' from training data. With only two months remaining in the period, and absent acceleration via a particularly egregious smoking gun or a judge eager for a headline-making precedent (despite earlier signs, no actual judicial intent for such a punitive order is visible yet), the base rate of nine-figure court-ordered AI copyright fines remains close to zero. Recent cases (Anthropic, Meta) reinforce that settlements\u2014not judgments\u2014dominate. My compliance perspective suggests that AI companies are presently in full legal risk-avoidance mode.

In contract law terms, the market for settlements and the threat of enormous statutory damages are driving companies toward deals, which courts are likely to approve. However, the short time to resolution is critical: class actions of this magnitude rarely reach final, court-ordered resolution\u2014including approval of settlements, not just private agreements\u2014within a two-month window, especially if there is no announced settlement as of now. While high base rates of multi-hundred-million copyright verdicts exist in egregious cases (esp. music/file sharing), legal uncertainty remains regarding fair use for AI training, and case posture (even OpenAI's) is only at post-motion-to-dismiss/discovery. Anthropic's out-of-court settlement was swift, but that was after years of litigation\u2014and the crucial, court-ordered piece happened within months of public announcement. An extremely rapid settlement and court approval is conceivable if OpenAI decides to mirror Anthropic\u2019s strategy in the shadow of tremendous risk, but there's no concrete sign such a move is imminent. Given these competing factors, and weighing the strong financial and normative incentives for rapid (court-entered) settlement against the procedural realities of federal court, the probability is elevated but clearly sub-50%.

The main limiting factor is timing\u2014while only ~2 months remain, courts have shown awareness of the scale and urgency, and AI companies have strong incentives to press for resolution (or force a court order, hoping for rapid appeal).

Given mounting technical evidence, motivated claimants, and judicial mood, with the only substantial risk being timeline creep past the cutoff date, I forecast a high probability.

OpenAI/Microsoft litigation), rules before Dec 31, 2025 that a defendant must pay $100M+ in statutory or actual damages, or levies a fine exceeding $100M for willful copyright infringement based on training data, and issues a binding judgment (possibly subject to appeal). This could also occur if the court converts a tentative settlement into an official order for the company to pay claimants, rather than a voluntary agreement.",

OpenAI case) have convinced skeptical judges. Most importantly, the Anthropic $1.5B settlement established both the legal, factual, and financial plausibility of $100M+ outcomes. However, the critical nuance is that this\u2014like nearly all previous large US IP payouts\u2014was the result of a negotiated settlement, not a formal court order or fine. The resolution criteria for this forecast require a US court to specifically order or fine a company >=$100M for its AI training conduct, not just approve a settlement. Case law in US IP (including copyright class actions and patent mega-cases) shows defendants almost always settle before a court can issue such a catastrophic, unbonded financial penalty, and even when courts do award large sums, payments are routinely stayed pending appeal. While it is highly likely that at least one AI company will shell out $100M+ for unauthorized data use, it is still moderately unlikely (given limited time and litigation incentives) that a US court will issue a qualifying order or fine before the end of 2025. The window is tight. Granting the surge in judicial willingness and legal clarity post-Anthropic, and the explicit threat to OpenAI/Microsoft and others, I raise the probability relative to long-term historical base rates\u2014but temper it considering the inherent inertia in US federal litigation. I also note that settlement amounts (even when court-approved) are not strictly fines or enforced payments unless structured by the court as such in consent decrees (not indicated here). Therefore, the most likely outcome is ongoing settlements, with qualifying court orders likely to land in 2026 or later.",

Sure, judicial skepticism toward fair use and the string of author victories getting past the pleading stage are meaningful, but those signals create settlement leverage, not a turbocharged litigation calendar.

We are chal\u00adleng\u00ading the legal\u00adity of GitHub Copi\u00adlot (and a related prod\u00aduct, OpenAI Codex, which pow\u00aders Copi\u00adlot).\" They contend that \"By train\u00ading their AI sys\u00adtems on pub\u00adlic GitHub repos\u00adi\u00adto\u00adries (though based on their pub\u00adlic state\u00adments, pos\u00adsi\u00adbly much more) we con\u00adtend that the defen\u00addants have vio\u00adlated the legal rights of a vast num\u00adber of cre\u00adators who posted code or other work under cer\u00adtain open-source licenses on GitHub.\"\n\nLawsuits about this might have a major effect on the ability or willingness of Frontier Labs to train large models, or the cost of doing so if they have to pay providers of the data (somehow).

The lawsuit, consolidated by authors including George R.R. Martin, Michael Chabon, and Sarah Silverman, alleges that OpenAI and Microsoft used their copyrighted works without permission to train large language models, resulting in AI outputs substantially similar to original material. Judge Stein ruled that a reasonable jury could find that ChatGPT\u2019s response\u2014suggesting a sequel titled 'A Dance with Shadows' with elements like 'ancient dragon-related magic,' a new Targaryen claimant named Lady Elara, and a rogue sect of Children of the Forest\u2014resembled protected works. The judge\u2019s decision allows the case to move forward, though OpenAI and Microsoft claim protection under the 'fair use' defense. This contrasts with a prior San Francisco ruling that deemed Anthropic\u2019s use of copyrighted books for AI training as fair use, which led to a $1.5 billion settlement. The case underscores growing legal tensions over AI training data and intellectual property rights.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:11 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-is-facing-a-game-of-thrones-problem/articleshow/124902443.cms)\n\n**Authors' Copyright Lawsuit Against OpenAI Allowed to Proceed, Court Rules**\nOn October 27, 2025, U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein of the Southern District of New York ruled that OpenAI must face a class-action copyright infringement lawsuit filed by multiple authors, rejecting OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss the case. The lawsuit, filed on June 13, 2025, accuses OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, of 'willfully and harmfully infringing' on authors' copyrights by training their large language models (LLMs) on copyrighted works without permission. The plaintiffs argue that OpenAI systematically copied protected texts to power its AI systems, which generate human-like responses based on user prompts. Judge Stein found that the allegations met the threshold for a prima facie claim of infringement, particularly regarding ChatGPT\u2019s ability to produce accurate summaries of authors\u2019 books. OpenAI had argued that summarizing content\u2014such as stating 'the murderer is the butler' from Mary Roberts Rinehart\u2019s novel *The Door*\u2014does not constitute infringement and that the plaintiffs failed to provide specific examples of infringing outputs. However, Judge Stein rejected this, noting that the complaint sufficiently demonstrated that OpenAI accessed the authors\u2019 works and that ChatGPT\u2019s outputs were substantially similar to the originals, especially in capturing plot, characters, themes, and overall tone. The judge cited a detailed summary of George R. R. Martin\u2019s *A Game of Thrones* as evidence of substantial similarity. Martin, along with John Grisham and David Baldacci, is among the plaintiffs. The case is significant as it follows a similar $1.5 billion settlement by Anthropic in September 2025, which agreed to pay after being accused of training its AI on approximately 500,000 copyrighted works. The Authors Guild praised the Anthropic settlement as a landmark moment, signaling that copyright infringement by AI companies will carry high financial costs and encouraging legal licensing. Other lawsuits are ongoing against Salesforce and Meta, though Meta won its case in June 2025, with the court ruling that plaintiffs failed to prove that Meta\u2019s AI models would harm their market. OpenAI has not responded to requests for comment as of October 28, 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 10:34 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/10/28/n14625271.htm)\n\n**AI News Roundup - Reddit sues Perplexity AI for unauthorized web scraping, OpenAI releases AI-powered web browser, AI data center backlash grows, and more**\nReddit has filed a federal lawsuit in New York City against Perplexity AI, alleging unauthorized web scraping of Reddit posts for AI training, citing unfair competition, unjust enrichment, and copyright infringement. The lawsuit claims Perplexity and other companies circumvented Reddit\u2019s anti-scraping measures by masking bot identities, and notes that Reddit has previously sued Anthropic in June 2024, with a hearing scheduled for January 2026. OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser for macOS with 'agent mode' that enables the AI to assist users in real time while browsing, including booking flights, making reservations, and shopping, using personalized memory. Windows, iOS, and Android versions are forthcoming. Meanwhile, global backlash is growing over the environmental impact of AI data centers, which consume massive amounts of electricity and water; in Ireland, over one-fifth of national electricity is used by data centers, sparking protests over farmland use and energy supply. Despite this, construction continues due to economic incentives. Anthropic has secured a multibillion-dollar deal with Google Cloud to access Google\u2019s custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training its Claude AI, with the new chips expected to come online in 2026. This follows similar deals by OpenAI with Nvidia and AMD. Additionally, OpenAI is developing a project codenamed Mercury, where former investment bankers from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are creating financial prompts and models to train AI for entry-level tasks in investment banking, such as analyzing spreadsheets and presentations, with human-reviewed inputs to ensure accuracy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 07:48 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ai-news-roundup-reddit-sues-perplexity-8129472/)\n\n**ChatGPT came up with a 'Game of Thrones' sequel idea. Now, a judge is letting George RR Martin sue for copyright infringement.**\nA U.S. District Judge in Manhattan, Sidney Stein, ruled that a class-action lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft over copyright infringement can proceed, citing a ChatGPT-generated sequel idea for George R.R. Martin\u2019s 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series as potentially infringing. The AI responded to a prompt asking for an alternative sequel to 'A Clash of Kings' different from 'A Storm of Swords' by proposing 'A Dance with Shadows,' featuring original plot elements such as 'ancient dragon-related magic,' a new claimant to the Iron Throne named Lady Elara (a distant Targaryen relative), and a 'rogue sect of Children of the Forest.' Judge Stein concluded that 'a reasonable jury could find that the allegedly infringing outputs are substantially similar to plaintiffs' works,' allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit consolidates claims from multiple authors, including Martin, Michael Chabon, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jia Tolentino, and Sarah Silverman, who allege that OpenAI and Microsoft used their copyrighted works without permission to train large language models. The judge deferred ruling on whether OpenAI and Microsoft are protected by the 'fair use' defense. This decision contrasts with a prior San Francisco ruling that found Anthropic\u2019s use of copyrighted books for training models was protected under fair use, though Anthropic later settled that case by agreeing to pay $1.5 billion to affected authors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 07:07 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/open-ai-chatgpt-microsoft-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-authors-rr-martin-2025-10)\n\n**Reddit Sues Perplexity and Other AI Firms Over Mass Extraction of User Comments**\nReddit filed a federal lawsuit in New York on October 28, 2025, against Perplexity AI, Oxylabs UAB, AWMProxy, and SerpApi, accusing them of participating in an 'illegal industrial-scale economy' to extract millions of user comments for commercial AI training purposes. The lawsuit alleges that these companies bypass Reddit\u2019s technical protections and use deceptive methods\u2014such as masking identities, hiding locations, and disguising web scrapers\u2014to harvest content directly from Google search results, circumventing direct access to Reddit\u2019s platform. Perplexity AI, based in San Francisco and known for its AI chatbot and search engine, is accused of being a willing client of these data extractors, purchasing stolen data instead of negotiating legal licensing agreements. Reddit\u2019s legal director, Ben Lee, compared the companies to 'bank robbers' who cannot break into the vault but instead hijack the armored truck. The case marks Reddit\u2019s second legal action of this nature, following a prior lawsuit against Anthropic in June 2025. Unlike the Anthropic case, this one targets not only an AI company but also the lesser-known data extraction services that enable AI training. Reddit has previously secured licensing deals with Google, OpenAI, and others, generating revenue from its over 100 million daily users.

Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series constitutes a copyright infringement, paving the way for a class-action lawsuit against OpenAI. The case, filed in September 2023 by 17 authors including Martin, John Grisham, and Jodi Picoult, accused OpenAI of 'systematic theft' of copyrighted material. The court found that a ChatGPT-generated continuation titled 'Dance with Shadows' \u2014 featuring plotlines involving 'a new ancient magic tied to dragons,' 'a distant relative of House Targaryen named Lady Elara,' and 'a rogue sect of the Children of the Forest' \u2014 bore sufficient similarity to Martin\u2019s copyrighted works to allow a reasonable jury to conclude infringement. The ruling supports the authors' claim that AI models are trained on protected texts without permission. The controversy intensified after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced development of a new creative writing AI, stating he was 'genuinely impressed' by AI-generated text, raising concerns about unauthorized use of copyrighted works. Critics also noted stylistic similarities between OpenAI's promotional content and the works of Japanese author Haruki Murakami. The Authors Guild coordinated the lawsuit, which is part of a broader movement by writers alarmed by AI's use of their protected content without consent or compensation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/entertainment_media/%D9%83%D8%AA%D9%91%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**Judge Allows George R.R. Martin to Sue OpenAI Over AI-Generated 'Game of Thrones' Sequel**\nA federal judge in New York, Sidney Stein, has allowed a class-action lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft to proceed, ruling that a jury could conclude that certain outputs from ChatGPT are 'substantially similar' to copyrighted works of authors, including George R.R. Martin. The decision, issued on October 28, 2025, was based on a specific example: a ChatGPT-generated alternative sequel to Martin\u2019s 'A Clash of Kings' titled 'A Dance with Shadows,' featuring original elements such as ancestral dragon magic, a distant Lady Elara Targaryen, and a dissenting sect of the Children of the Forest. The case consolidates claims from prominent authors\u2014Martin, Michael Chabon, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jia Tolentino, and Sarah Silverman\u2014alleging that their works were used without permission to train AI models and that the AI can generate content that protectsably resembles their plots, characters, and passages. Judge Stein did not rule on the defense of 'fair use' at this stage, deferring that issue to later proceedings. The ruling confirms that the claims are plausible enough to move forward, requiring discovery, expert testimony on substantial similarity, and potential future motions on fair use and how similarity should be measured (e.g., idea vs. expression, fantasy tropes vs. event sequences). The decision does not resolve the broader conflict but ensures a legal battle over AI-generated content, innovation, and copyright. This process follows a similar case in San Francisco involving Anthropic, where a preliminary settlement of $1.5 billion was approved in September 2025. The outcome in New York may influence whether such cases are settled or go to trial.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 11:05 AM\nSource:[Vandal](https://vandal.elespanol.com/random/un-juez-da-luz-verde-a-george-rr-martin-77-para-demandar-a-openai-por-una-secuela-de-juego-de-tronos-escrita-por-chatgpt/37810.html)\n\n**George R.R. Martin Wins First Legal Battle Against AI Company Over Copyright Infringement**\nGeorge R.R. Martin, the author of the acclaimed 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series that inspired the TV show 'Game of Thrones', achieved a significant legal victory in his class-action lawsuit against OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. On October 29, 2025, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein in Manhattan ruled that the case can proceed, determining that AI-generated texts could infringe on the copyrights of Martin and other authors. The lawsuit, filed in September 2023, was brought by Martin, Michael Chabon, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jia Tolentino, and Sarah Silverman, who accuse OpenAI and Microsoft of training their language models on copyrighted books without permission. In a key example, the plaintiffs asked ChatGPT to generate a detailed sequel to 'A Clash of Kings' diverging from 'A Storm of Swords'. The AI responded with a creative outline titled 'A Dance with Shadows', featuring original elements such as ancestral dragon magic, a new claimant to the Iron Throne named Lady Elara (a distant Targaryen descendant), and a rebel sect of Children of the Forest. Judge Stein found that the level of detail, thematic similarity, and stylistic resemblance to Martin\u2019s work were sufficient to allow the case to move forward as a class action. He stated that 'a reasonable jury could find that the allegedly infringing outputs are substantially similar to the plaintiffs' works.' While the ruling does not decide the case on its merits, it rejects OpenAI\u2019s defense based on the 'fair use' doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material for innovation and research\u2014a principle currently under intense legal debate. This case is part of a broader wave of lawsuits challenging AI companies\u2019 use of copyrighted content. Earlier in 2025, a similar case against Anthropic ended in a $1.5 billion settlement, despite a San Francisco judge previously ruling that the use might qualify as 'fair use'. The decision sets a critical precedent for creators asserting harm from AI training practices.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 10:54 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/entretenimiento/2025/10/29/el-autor-de-game-of-thrones-gano-la-primera-batalla-en-contra-de-una-empresa-de-ia-por-derechos-de-autor/)\n\n**ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is facing a 'Game of Thrones' problem - The Times of India**\nA U.S. judge, Sidney Stein, has allowed a major class-action lawsuit against OpenAI to proceed, citing a ChatGPT-generated outline for a 'Game of Thrones' sequel as a potential copyright violation. The lawsuit, consolidated by authors including George R.R. Martin, Michael Chabon, and Sarah Silverman, alleges that OpenAI and Microsoft used their copyrighted works without permission to train large language models, resulting in AI outputs substantially similar to original material.

Stein of the Southern District of New York ruled that OpenAI must face a class-action copyright infringement lawsuit filed by multiple authors, rejecting OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss the case. The lawsuit, filed on June 13, 2025, accuses OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, of 'willfully and harmfully infringing' on authors' copyrights by training their large language models (LLMs) on copyrighted works without permission. The plaintiffs argue that OpenAI systematically copied protected texts to power its AI systems, which generate human-like responses based on user prompts. Judge Stein found that the allegations met the threshold for a prima facie claim of infringement, particularly regarding ChatGPT\u2019s ability to produce accurate summaries of authors\u2019 books. OpenAI had argued that summarizing content\u2014such as stating 'the murderer is the butler' from Mary Roberts Rinehart\u2019s novel *The Door*\u2014does not constitute infringement and that the plaintiffs failed to provide specific examples of infringing outputs. However, Judge Stein rejected this, noting that the complaint sufficiently demonstrated that OpenAI accessed the authors\u2019 works and that ChatGPT\u2019s outputs were substantially similar to the originals, especially in capturing plot, characters, themes, and overall tone. The judge cited a detailed summary of George R. R. Martin\u2019s *A Game of Thrones* as evidence of substantial similarity. Martin, along with John Grisham and David Baldacci, is among the plaintiffs. The case is significant as it follows a similar $1.5 billion settlement by Anthropic in September 2025, which agreed to pay after being accused of training its AI on approximately 500,000 copyrighted works. The Authors Guild praised the Anthropic settlement as a landmark moment, signaling that copyright infringement by AI companies will carry high financial costs and encouraging legal licensing. Other lawsuits are ongoing against Salesforce and Meta, though Meta won its case in June 2025, with the court ruling that plaintiffs failed to prove that Meta\u2019s AI models would harm their market.

The lawsuit claims Perplexity and other companies circumvented Reddit\u2019s anti-scraping measures by masking bot identities, and notes that Reddit has previously sued Anthropic in June 2024, with a hearing scheduled for January 2026. OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser for macOS with 'agent mode' that enables the AI to assist users in real time while browsing, including booking flights, making reservations, and shopping, using personalized memory. Windows, iOS, and Android versions are forthcoming. Meanwhile, global backlash is growing over the environmental impact of AI data centers, which consume massive amounts of electricity and water; in Ireland, over one-fifth of national electricity is used by data centers, sparking protests over farmland use and energy supply. Despite this, construction continues due to economic incentives. Anthropic has secured a multibillion-dollar deal with Google Cloud to access Google\u2019s custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training its Claude AI, with the new chips expected to come online in 2026. This follows similar deals by OpenAI with Nvidia and AMD.

Stein of the Southern District of New York ruled that OpenAI must face a consolidated class action lawsuit alleging copyright infringement by authors, including George R. R. Martin, John Grisham, and David Baldacci. The plaintiffs accuse OpenAI and its funder Microsoft of systematically copying their copyrighted works to train large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which then generate outputs substantially similar to the original texts. Judge Stein denied OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss, stating the allegations satisfy the legal threshold for a prima facie claim of infringement, particularly citing a detailed AI-generated summary of 'A Game of Thrones' that mirrored the book\u2019s plot, characters, themes, and tone. OpenAI argued that summaries like 'the butler did it' for 'The Door' by Mary Roberts Rinehart do not constitute infringement and that the complaint failed to provide specific examples of infringing outputs. Judge Stein rejected this, emphasizing that the complaint adequately alleges 'actual copying' and that the outputs are derived from the plaintiffs\u2019 works. The ruling follows Anthropic\u2019s $1.5 billion settlement over similar claims, which the Authors Guild hailed as a milestone, signaling that AI companies will face significant consequences for unauthorized use of copyrighted material. The Authors Guild also noted that class actions are proving effective in addressing mass copyright infringement. Other ongoing cases include a lawsuit against Salesforce for allegedly using hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books to train its XGen models, and a prior case against Meta, which was dismissed due to lack of evidence showing market dilution.

This marks a significant evolution in AI-assisted software development, enabling developers to assign asynchronous tasks to different AI agents from a single interface, track progress, and manage AI-generated code with branch controls, identity features, and policy management. According to GitHub, this integration is only possible because of its unique combination of code context, community, and workflow infrastructure. OpenAI\u2019s Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos affirmed that Codex will now be available through the paid GitHub Copilot Pro+ subscription, extending its reach to millions of developers. Anthropic\u2019s Mike Krieger emphasized that Claude can now act as a native team member by creating branches, committing code, and responding to pull requests. Google\u2019s Kathy Korevec highlighted that Agent HQ reduces friction by making AI agents 'native assignees' in the development process. The platform also introduces 'Mission Control'\u2014a unified interface for managing agentic work\u2014though its name has drawn criticism due to its overlap with Apple\u2019s macOS feature. While concerns remain about AI 'memories' and potential lock-in, GitHub\u2019s agent-agnostic approach aims to prevent vendor lock-in by allowing multiple AI models to coexist. The move is widely seen as a major step toward collaborative AI development, with potential for substantial productivity gains.

The lawsuit alleges that these companies bypass Reddit\u2019s technical protections and use deceptive methods\u2014such as masking identities, hiding locations, and disguising web scrapers\u2014to harvest content directly from Google search results, circumventing direct access to Reddit\u2019s platform. Perplexity AI, based in San Francisco and known for its AI chatbot and search engine, is accused of being a willing client of these data extractors, purchasing stolen data instead of negotiating legal licensing agreements. Reddit\u2019s legal director, Ben Lee, compared the companies to 'bank robbers' who cannot break into the vault but instead hijack the armored truck. The case marks Reddit\u2019s second legal action of this nature, following a prior lawsuit against Anthropic in June 2025. Unlike the Anthropic case, this one targets not only an AI company but also the lesser-known data extraction services that enable AI training. Reddit has previously secured licensing deals with Google, OpenAI, and others, generating revenue from its over 100 million daily users. As of October 28, 2025, Oxylabs and SerpApi had not responded to requests for comment, and AWMProxy could not be contacted.

The lawsuit accuses the defendants of bypassing Reddit\u2019s anti-scraping protections, circumventing Google\u2019s controls, and stealing content directly from Google\u2019s search results by masking identities and disguising scrapers. Reddit claims Perplexity, a San Francisco-based AI chatbot developer, is a willing customer of at least one scraper, choosing to buy stolen data instead of entering a lawful licensing agreement. Oxylabs expressed shock and stated that no company should claim ownership of public data, suggesting Reddit\u2019s action may be an attempt to resell public data at inflated prices. SerpApi\u2019s director stated they strongly disagree with the allegations and will defend themselves vigorously. AWMProxy could not be reached for comment.

Molly Tanzer and Jennifer Gilmore, who accuse the company of illegally using hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books to train its AI models, including XGen and CodeGen. The lawsuit, filed under U.S. Copyright Law, alleges that Salesforce used datasets such as RedPajama, The Pile, and Books3\u2014containing over 196,000 books sourced from the private tracker Bibliotik\u2014for model development. Initially, Salesforce listed RedPajama-Books as a training source in GitHub repositories, but removed these references by September 2023, replacing them with vague mentions of 'publicly available language data.' The company\u2019s CEO, Marc Benioff, acknowledged in a January 2024 Bloomberg interview that 'all training data has been stolen,' reinforcing the controversy. Hugging Face, which hosted Books3, removed the dataset in October 2023 after copyright complaints. The lawsuit claims Salesforce commercialized AI services like XGen-Sales after erasing evidence of its data sources and only in December 2023 asserted its models were trained on 'legally compliant' data. The case aligns with broader litigation against tech firms over AI training data, but faces hurdles: plaintiffs must prove actual financial harm, not just unauthorized use. Previous rulings have dismissed similar claims against Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic, citing insufficient market damage. However, legal expert Ishita Sharma warns that using public datasets like RedPajama or The Pile does not absolve liability if companies knew or ignored copyright violations. The authors seek class certification for U.S. copyright holders whose works were used since October 2022, demanding statutory damages, destruction of infringing copies, seizure of profits, a formal declaration of intentional infringement, and legal fees.

The lawsuit, brought by authors E. Molly Tanzer and Jennifer Gilmore under the Copyright Act, alleges ongoing infringement, claiming Salesforce continues to store, copy, use, and process datasets containing unauthorized copies of plaintiffs' works. Salesforce initially acknowledged using 'RedPajama-Books' in June 2023, linking to the datasets on GitHub, but by September 2023, it removed those references, replacing them with vague descriptions of 'natural language data' from 'publicly available sources.' Hugging Face removed Books3 the following month due to copyright complaints. The suit also alleges Salesforce used The Pile to train its CodeGen models in 2022 and commercialized the technology via its Agentforce AI platform, including the XGen-Sales model launched in October 2024. By December 2023, Salesforce claimed its models used a 'legally compliant dataset' with no mention of RedPajama. Legal expert Ishita Sharma of Fathom Legal noted that authors must prove real financial harm, not just unauthorized use, citing recent dismissals of similar claims against Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic\u2014though one judge criticized Anthropic for maintaining a 'permanent library of pirated books.' Sharma emphasized that using public datasets does not automatically absolve liability if companies knew or ignored copyright violations. The complaint references Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's January 2024 statement to Bloomberg, where he said AI companies 'ripped off' training data and that 'all the training data has been stolen.'

Two neuroscientists, Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen Macknik, professors at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, claim Apple accessed and utilized illicit libraries of pirated books, violating copyright law. They demand financial compensation\u2014though specific amounts are not detailed\u2014and an injunction to stop Apple from using their works and other copyrighted materials without authorization. The lawsuit specifically cites two of their publications, 'Champions of Illusion: The Science Behind Mind-Boggling Images and Mystifying Brain Puzzles' and 'Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals About Our Everyday Deceptions,' as being used in training. The plaintiffs argue that Apple's use of 'shadow libraries' of pirated texts constitutes a direct infringement of copyright and reflects a widespread industry practice. The lawsuit highlights that Apple's market capitalization increased by over $200 billion the day after the official launch of Apple Intelligence, underscoring the economic benefit derived from the AI system. This case is part of a broader wave of legal actions against tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Anthropic, involving authors, media representatives, and record labels. A notable precedent was Anthropic\u2019s $1.5 billion settlement in September 2024 to resolve a similar lawsuit. The core issue across these cases is the right of creators to control and be compensated for the use of their works in AI training, especially when such use generates massive corporate profits.

The plaintiffs, Susana Mart\u00ednez-Conde and Stephen Macknik, professors at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, allege their books, 'Champions of Illusion' and 'Sleights of Mind,' were included in these datasets, which reportedly contain pirated copies. The complaint seeks damages, an injunction to stop unauthorized use of copyrighted works, and potential retraining of models or retroactive licensing if the claims are proven. The case comes amid a wave of similar lawsuits against OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic, with the latter settling for $1.5 billion. Apple has not issued a public statement. The lawsuit highlights the growing legal and ethical debate over 'fair use' in AI training, especially as Apple Intelligence\u2014integrated into iOS devices\u2014has driven over $200 billion in market capitalization growth following its announcement. The case may set a precedent for how AI developers source data, balancing innovation with copyright protection.

The outcome could determine whether AI companies must obtain licenses or retrain models using legally sourced data.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 12:54 AM\nSource:[Actualidad Literatura](https://www.actualidadliteratura.com/demandan-a-apple-por-usar-libros-con-copyright-para-entrenar-apple-intelligence/)\n\n**Copyright On Trial: Major Studios Challenge AI Training Practices In Midjourney Lawsuit**\nOn June 11, 2025, The Walt Disney Company and Universal Studios filed a landmark federal lawsuit against Midjourney in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, accusing the AI company of 'massive and deliberate copyright infringement' by training its image-generation models on tens of thousands of copyrighted images without authorization. The plaintiffs allege that Midjourney's AI produces outputs that are 'virtually indistinguishable' from original characters such as Elsa, Shrek, Darth Vader, and Homer Simpson, violating both U.S. copyright law and the spirit of intellectual property protection. The studios claim that prior cease-and-desist letters were ignored and seek injunctive relief, including a halt to training on their content and the implementation of proactive copyright filters. This case emerges amid a growing legal landscape involving AI and intellectual property, including Getty Images v. Stability AI (2023), The New York Times v. OpenAI & Microsoft (2023), and Andersen v. Stability AI (2023), all of which challenge the boundaries of fair use in AI training. The lawsuit raises critical questions about whether training AI on copyrighted material constitutes infringement, especially when the outputs closely replicate original works. If successful, the studios could force AI companies to license training data, adopt technical safeguards like Content ID, or establish industry-wide licensing frameworks. A ruling in Midjourney\u2019s favor could allow broader AI training on public content, reshaping innovation and authorship. The outcome will likely set a precedent influencing future legislation, AI development practices, and the relationship between artificial intelligence and creative ownership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 10:16 AM\nSource:[Mondaq Business Briefing](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/copyright/1688718/copyright-on-trial-major-studios-challenge-ai-training-practices-in-midjourney-lawsuit)\n\n**Neuroscientists Sue Apple, Claim \u2018Apple Intelligence\u2019 Trained on Stolen Works**\nTwo neuroscientists, Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen Macknik, filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against Apple on October 9, 2025, alleging that Apple\u2019s \u2018Apple Intelligence\u2019 AI model was trained using pirated digital copies of their books, \u2018Champions of Illusion\u2019 and \u2018Sleights of Mind,\u2019 obtained from shadow libraries such as Z-Library and LibGen. The plaintiffs claim Apple failed to adequately filter unauthorized content from its training datasets, despite Apple\u2019s public assertion that its AI systems are trained on licensed data, publicly available web content, and user interactions with opt-out provisions via AppleBot. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and a court order to prevent future use of copyrighted material in AI training. The case raises broader concerns about AI data sourcing, particularly the use of pirated content from shadow libraries, which operate in legal gray zones. A U.S. Copyright Office report warns that using pirated material may undermine fair use defenses and that AI outputs substantially similar to copyrighted inputs could constitute infringement. Apple\u2019s market capitalization rose over $200 billion following the launch of Apple Intelligence, increasing the financial stakes. The lawsuit joins similar cases against Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic, collectively challenging the transparency and legality of AI training data. In response, demand is growing for provenance-verified datasets\u2014collections with documented licensing and origin. Companies like 273 Ventures, Common Corpus, and Fairly Trained are developing legally compliant data repositories and certification tools. Legal experts predict that regulatory scrutiny and investor interest will increasingly favor firms offering data curation and verification services, signaling a potential turning point for the AI industry toward lawful and transparent data sourcing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[CoinCentral](https://coincentral.com/neuroscientists-sue-apple-claim-apple-intelligence-trained-on-stolen-works/)\n\n**OpenAI, Anthropic Weigh Using Investor Funds to Cover Billions in AI Copyright Lawsuits \u2014 FT - Tekedia**\nOpenAI and Anthropic, leading artificial intelligence developers, are reportedly considering using investor funds to cover potential multibillion-dollar legal settlements from ongoing copyright infringement lawsuits. According to a Financial Times report published on October 9, 2025, the companies are exploring the use of venture capital and corporate funding to offset liabilities if courts rule that their AI models unlawfully used copyrighted materials during training. The lawsuits, filed by authors, media organizations, and entertainment companies, allege that generative AI systems like OpenAI\u2019s GPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude copied vast amounts of text, books, and visual content from the internet without authorization. These class actions, primarily in U.S. federal courts, claim that AI outputs constitute derivative works, challenging the legality of the training data. Industry lawyers estimate potential liabilities across the AI sector could exceed tens of billions of dollars, depending on court interpretations of 'fair use' and derivative work status. OpenAI has purchased insurance coverage through Aon, reportedly up to $300 million, though insiders suggest the actual amount is significantly lower. Given the mismatch between insurance limits and potential exposure, OpenAI is reportedly considering a 'self-insurance' strategy by setting aside funds in a ring-fenced 'captive' vehicle, a mechanism used by large corporations to manage unique risks. This would require approval from major investors such as Microsoft, Thrive Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. Anthropic, backed by Amazon and Google, is similarly facing legal exposure and has already begun using its capital reserves to fund a preliminary $1.5 billion settlement in a California-based copyright class action, a landmark deal in AI litigation history. The report highlights a growing legal and financial reckoning for the AI industry, as the legality of training on publicly available copyrighted data remains unresolved. While AI developers argue their practices fall under 'fair use' for research and innovation, creators contend that the scale of data use constitutes industrial-scale copying without compensation. Traditional insurers lack historical data to model AI-related risks, limiting coverage capacity. If OpenAI and Anthropic proceed with self-insurance, it could divert investor capital from product development to legal defense, potentially slowing innovation and signaling financial strain. Analysts warn this legal uncertainty poses a fundamental challenge to the AI business model, with courts' decisions on data use potentially forcing a complete reevaluation of how AI systems are trained and built. For investors, the rising legal risks may impact the long-term attractiveness of AI ventures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 09:44 AM\nSource:[tekedia.com](https://www.tekedia.com/openai-anthropic-weigh-using-investor-funds-to-cover-billions-in-ai-copyright-lawsuits-ft/)\n\n**AI Copyright Lawsuits: After Anthropic's $1.5B Payout, Who's Next?**\nThe article reports that Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5\u202fbillion to settle a class\u2011action lawsuit from authors who alleged the company used pirated book libraries to train its Claude AI. The settlement, the first of its kind, also requires Anthropic to destroy the pirated datasets, underscoring that the source of training data matters. A federal judge had suggested that training on legally acquired copyrighted works could be fair use, but drew a hard line at Anthropic\u2019s downloading of millions of books from pirate sites such as LibGen, which the court deemed unlawful. The piece notes that OpenAI faces a high\u2011profile lawsuit from the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes, which claims the company used millions of its articles without permission, and that authors like George\u202fR.R.\u202fMartin, John\u202fGrisham and Michael\u202fConnelly have joined a class\u2011action alleging systematic theft. Meta recently won a lawsuit dismissal, but the judge warned that the ruling does not establish the legality of using copyrighted material to train language models. Google\u2019s history of settlements over privacy and patent issues suggests it could face similar pressure. The article concludes that the Anthropic settlement signals the end of the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d era, prompting a shift toward licensing agreements with news organizations such as the Associated Press and Axel Springer. It emphasizes that future AI development will likely rely on legally sourced data and compensation for creators. The article contains the following quoted statements: 'scrape first, ask questions later', 'This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta's use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful.', and 'The settlement, resolving claims that Anthropic knowingly used pirated book libraries to train its Claude AI, is the first of its kind and sets a powerful precedent.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 06:04 PM\nSource:[StartupHub.ai](https://www.startuphub.ai/ai-news/startup-news/2025/ai-copyright-lawsuits-after-anthropics-1-5b-payout-whos-next/)\n\n**Anthropic Reaches US$1.5\u202fBillion Settlement with Authors Over Unauthorized Use of Books**\nAnthropic, an artificial\u2011intelligence startup, agreed to pay US$ 1.5\u202fbillion (R$\u202f8.1\u202fbillion) to settle a class action brought by authors who alleged that the company used their books to train the chatbot Claude without permission. The settlement, approved by a federal court in San\u202fFrancisco, was described by the authors\u2019 lawyers as 'a maior recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de direitos autorais da hist\u00f3ria' and the first major win of the generative\u2011AI era. Anthropic will also destroy millions of pirated books stored on its servers; the initial indemnity amounts to about US$\u202f3,000 per title for the 500,000 titles identified, with the possibility of additional payments if more works are found. The case is part of a wave of lawsuits against tech giants such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta, all accused of using copyrighted material to train AI models. Anthropic did not admit liability but pledged to develop 'safe and responsible' systems. The settlement avoided a December trial that could have resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in damages. The lawsuit was filed in 2023 by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who claimed that Anthropic\u2014backed by Amazon and Alphabet\u2014used millions of pirated books to train Claude. Judge William Alsup had earlier allowed Anthropic to invoke fair use for training but found that the company violated authors\u2019 rights by maintaining a 'central library' of more than 7\u202fmillion pirated books. Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the outcome 'a vital step to recognize that AI companies cannot simply appropriate authors\u2019 creative work'. The fair\u2011use question remains contested, with another San\u202fFrancisco judge recently ruling that using protected material to train AI is illegal in 'many circumstances'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 10:40 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/tec/2025/09/anthropic-fecha-acordo-de-us-15-bi-com-escritores-em-processo-de-direitos-autorais.shtml)\n\n",

    "summary": "The expert forecasts on whether a US court will fine, or order a company to pay to claimants, $100M or more because of how they used data to train a large AI model before 2026, indicate a strong consensus that the probability is low, though not zero, primarily due to timing and litigation process factors. Most experts (across law, corporate compliance, economics, and computer science) point out that while there is escalating legal and financial risk for AI firms\u2014evidenced by major settlements like Anthropic's $1.5B\u2014these outcomes have so far occurred via settlement rather than a court-ordered judgment or fine. Procedurally, even fast-moving cases (such as those against OpenAI, Apple, Salesforce, and others) have only recently passed motions to dismiss and are now entering discovery, with trial, class certification, and damages or fine determination unlikely to conclude before the December 31, 2025 deadline. Historical precedent in US mass tort, copyright, and class action cases shows that such large court-ordered awards usually take years, not months, to materialize, and are almost always preceded by settlements. Several factors that could slightly raise the probability\u2014such as increased judicial willingness to allow cases to proceed, higher financial benchmarks established by recent settlements, and mounting technical evidence of copyright infringement\u2014are offset by persistent incentives to settle before judgment, as well as procedural and appellate delays. A minority of experts assign somewhat higher probabilities, citing the rapid pace and heightened momentum for litigation and the potential for a landmark, expedited court order following an egregious finding. However, most see the likelihood as materially under 50%, with the bulk of forecasts clustered under 30% and some as low as 2%. Only one forecast gives a slightly above-even chance (55%) and one other (81%) is notably bullish based on current legal trends and urgent case posture, but these are outliers. The central scenario remains that, while the legal and compliance risk facing AI firms is unprecedented, it is highly unlikely a final, qualifying US court order or fine at or above $100M will be issued specifically for AI training data by the end of 2025; settlements, not judgments, will dominate, and the window is probably too short for an exceptional final court ruling.",
