Though governing coalitions can theoretically fail, in practice, reputational and legitimation costs bind both opposition and supporting parties to the status quo during the early post-election window. Additionally, public perception of Poilievre as too polarizing further reduces any chance that parties would risk government formation with him at the helm, even amidst instability.

While reputational and legitimation costs for destabilizing a new government are real, the actual mechanism for leadership change requires both a no-confidence event and the time-consuming logistics of an election or, even more implausibly, a major cross-party agreement for a government led by the recent opposition loser. Even factoring in negative perceptions of Poilievre, the pathway is doubly blocked\u2014by party dynamics and institutional timelines.

Notably, debate between experts in polling, Canadian party systems, journalism, and leadership change repeatedly emphasized (1) the logistical impossibility of Poilievre's ascension prior to 2026 even in the event of a Liberal collapse post-budget, and (2) the lack of even minimal real-world precursors to such an event. Given these factors, and the clear absence of new risk factors since Phase I, I am marginally lowering my probability to align with the 5% single-digit range, which best reflects both the micro and macro-political constraints and the collective expert consensus.",

Several forecasters made persuasive arguments for probabilities well below 10%, highlighting the tight parliamentary arithmetic, lack of credible collapse signals, intra-Conservative challenges, and the steep legitimation cost of overturning an election so soon after it occurred. Revisiting my own prior forecast, I recognize that my original probability of 23% inadequately discounted the strong stabilizing effect of recent electoral legitimation and the minimal window left for any plausible pathway to a Poilievre premiership. Incorporating deliberative insights and cross-disciplinary base rate evidence, a more defensible and well-calibrated probability is 8%.",

Arguments for probabilities in the 20%+ range were consistently critiqued as overestimating tail risk and underweighting both the extreme rarity of post-election turnover and the almost total absence of news-cycle indicators for imminent instability. Furthermore, additional insights from voter behavior, election timing, and legitimacy norms reinforce that even in minority situations, Canadian governments are notably robust in their early months following a fresh mandate. No new evidence or parliamentary dynamics suggest pathways for a snap election or Poilievre premiership before 2026. In light of this, I now judge that the most honest and evidence-based probability falls between 1% and 3%. I therefore revise my probability downward to 2%.",

Critiques of higher probabilities emphasized the convergence of empirical base rates, the extreme rarity of opposition leaders assuming power so soon after an election, parliamentary procedures that would prevent a snap election and government change within the remaining timeline, and the powerful stabilizing effects of post-election legitimacy on governing and opposition parties alike. The more persuasive points from both the defenses and critiques indicate that even accounting for black swan risks and the fragility of minority governments, the true risk is best captured by a prediction in the 5\u20138% range, reflecting both the low base rate and the possibility of extreme but historically unprecedented events.",

Deliberation highlighted the extremely short window, the near-majority possessed by the Liberals, procedural constraints relating to the timing of elections and parliamentary sessions, and the logistical near-impossibility of calling, holding, and resolving a snap election before 2026. While some argue for slightly higher probabilities to capture low-frequency 'black swan' risks, the majority of compelling, evidence-based arguments clearly cluster in the low single digits.

Analysts estimate the deficit could approach $100\u202fbillion, and Carney acknowledged that $40\u202fbillion of additional spending had already been announced six months into the fiscal year. Poilievre warned that deficits drive up inflation, grocery prices, housing costs and interest rates, and that the government\u2019s fiscal anchors\u2014capping the annual deficit at 1\u202f% of GDP and maintaining a declining debt\u2011to\u2011GDP ratio\u2014are under scrutiny.

Poilievre said, 'When I left, there was a Liberal prime minister who was making excuses about breaking promises, running massive deficits. Costs, crime, chaos were all out of control,' and repeated the criticism when Carney replied, 'I understand the leader of the opposition was busy,' referring to Poilievre\u2019s loss of a seat and missed tax cuts. Conservative MPs shouted across the aisle. Government House Leader Steven MacKinnon admitted he had \u2018no illusion\u2019 about cooperation but warned Poilievre could choose to work with Liberals. Poilievre promised his MPs would work with any party, yet attacked Carney\u2019s record, saying, 'That is not what Canadians voted for. What we are getting from Mark Carney is the same Liberal bait\u2011and\u2011switch.' MacKinnon outlined the Liberal agenda: an austerity budget with a \u2018substantial\u2019 deficit, a controversial border\u2011security bill, and a willingness to listen to \u2018constructive criticism\u2019 and \u2018responsible alternative policies.\u2019 The Liberals and Conservatives had previously cooperated on major\u2011projects legislation, but remain divided on criminal\u2011justice matters; Conservative justice critic Larry Brock called for stricter bail, while Justice Minister Sean Fraser promised bills on hate crimes and violence. The Liberals hold 169 of the 343 seats in the House, needing only three more votes to pass legislation. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves\u2011Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet suggested MacKinnon might need to explain contradictory statements, and NDP MP Alexandre Boulerice said his caucus is ready to collaborate if results are delivered.

Jacques told a House of Commons committee that he was unsure whether the government still has its fiscal anchors, saying this causes 'a considerable degree of concern at this point.' Carney responded during a question period with Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre that the government does indeed have fiscal anchors guiding the budgeting process. He declined to answer Poilievre\u2019s question about the size of the federal deficit ahead of the federal budget slated for Nov. 4, but reaffirmed a commitment to balance the operating side of the budget within three years. Carney also said the country will see a declining level of debt and that the government is building the strongest economy in the G7.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 07:07 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/carney-argues-his-government-has-fiscal-anchors-after-pbo-raises-concerns/article_188aebc2-cda8-5222-a1ef-c8b722b6cb34.html)\n\n**Former federal Conservative minister to steer B.C. municipal party - BC News**\nA former Conservative cabinet minister, Kerry\u2011Lynne Findlay, has been appointed advisory board chair of the Conservative Electors Association (CEA), a new municipal political party that will contest the 2026 B.C. local\u2011government elections.

It recounts that in the April federal election the Conservatives lost to Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, with Poilievre even losing his Ottawa\u2011area riding. A Conservative MP in Alberta later stepped aside to allow Poilievre a by\u2011election, which he won in a Conservative stronghold after donning a giant cowboy hat. Poilievre is quoted as saying, 'I have to admit, Mark Carney has looked really busy this summer \u2013 he\u2019s almost as busy and as useless as George Costanza.'

Poilievre said, 'When I left, there was a Liberal prime minister who was making excuses about breaking promises, running massive deficits. Costs, crime, chaos were all out of control,' and repeated the criticism when Carney replied, 'I understand the leader of the opposition was busy,' referring to Poilievre\u2019s loss of a seat and missed tax cuts. Conservative MPs shouted across the aisle. Government House Leader Steven MacKinnon admitted he had \u2018no illusion\u2019 about cooperation but warned Poilievre could choose to work with Liberals. Poilievre promised his MPs would work with any party, yet attacked Carney\u2019s record, saying, 'That is not what Canadians voted for. What we are getting from Mark Carney is the same Liberal bait\u2011and\u2011switch.' MacKinnon outlined the Liberal agenda: an austerity budget with a \u2018substantial\u2019 deficit, a controversial border\u2011security bill, and a willingness to listen to \u2018constructive criticism\u2019 and \u2018responsible alternative policies.\u2019 The Liberals and Conservatives had previously cooperated on major\u2011projects legislation, but remain divided on criminal\u2011justice matters; Conservative justice critic Larry Brock called for stricter bail, while Justice Minister Sean Fraser promised bills on hate crimes and violence. The Liberals hold 169 of the 343 seats in the House, needing only three more votes to pass legislation. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves\u2011Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet suggested MacKinnon might need to explain contradictory statements, and NDP MP Alexandre Boulerice said his caucus is ready to collaborate if results are delivered.

New Prime Minister Mark Carney and opposition leader Pierre Poilievre will stand two sword\u2011lengths apart on the Commons aisle, reflecting the narrow two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011percentage\u2011point margin that separated the Liberal and Conservative parties in the federal election. Poilievre, who led the Conservatives to 144 seats \u2013 the party\u2019s best popular\u2011vote share in more than three decades \u2013 must now demonstrate a convincing, confidence\u2011inspiring performance before the January vote of Conservative members tests his leadership. He has warned that 'things are getting worse' in Canada under Carney\u2019s leadership and that the Conservatives are ready to 'propose solutions' to the country\u2019s economic woes. Poilievre has also used the metaphors 'housing hell' and 'hell on earth' to criticize Liberal policies, and his favourite refrain is 'Hell, hell, hell.' Yves\u2011Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, has pledged to advance separatism and oppose Carney\u2019s 'centralising' agenda, while Don Davies, interim leader of the New Democrats, will likely support Carney on some measures but remains wary of aligning too closely with the Liberals.

It notes that Prime Minister Mark\u202fCarney and Opposition Leader Pierre\u202fPoilievre will sit two sword\u2011lengths apart in the House of Commons, reflecting the narrow two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011percentage\u2011point margin between the Liberals and Conservatives in the federal election. Carney faces a 169\u2011of\u2011172 vote majority requirement to pass key legislation, including the October federal budget, and must keep his cabinet and backbenchers aligned amid criticism over his handling of trade threats and climate policy. Poilievre, who has regained the Official Opposition leadership, is expected to balance attack rhetoric with proposals to address economic woes, ahead of a January leadership vote. The piece also discusses potential allies: the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, led by Yves\u2011Fran\u00e7ois\u202fBlanchet, may oppose Carney\u2019s centralising agenda; the New Democratic Party, under interim leader Don\u202fDavies, could support selective measures while distancing itself from the Liberals. Committees and caucus dynamics are highlighted, noting the Green Party\u2019s single MP and the NDP\u2019s lack of official status. Hot topics include Quebec sovereignty, the oil\u2011gas sector, unemployment (7.1\u202f%), inflation, housing affordability, and immigration. The article quotes Carney\u2019s advisers, former leaders, and political commentators, and uses metaphors such as \u201cPolitics is like hockey\u201d to illustrate his style.

The by\u2011election is described as the first and easiest step on Poilievre\u2019s road to political recovery, following his defeat in the 2025 general election and loss of his Carleton seat.  According to the Conservative Party constitution, a leader defeated in a general election must face a confidence vote at the next national convention in January\u202f2026, which will be held in Calgary.\n\nThe Angus Reid Institute (ARI) released post\u2011election polling that shows a significant portion of Canadians, including Conservatives, view Poilievre as too similar to U.S. President Donald Trump.  The survey found 59\u202f% of respondents agreed with the statement \u2018Pierre Poilievre sounded too much like Donald Trump\u2019 during the 2025 campaign, versus 35\u202f% who disagreed.  Regionally, majorities in Quebec (64\u202f%), Atlantic Canada (63\u202f%), Ontario (60\u202f%) and British Columbia (58\u202f%) agreed, and even in Alberta and Saskatchewan the agreement and disagreement rates were similar.\n\nAmong all voters, 55\u202f% of men and 64\u202f% of women agreed with the Trump comparison, and 19\u202f% of Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) voters held the same view, representing one in five Conservatives.  Additional dissatisfaction was noted: 29\u202f% of Conservatives said the campaign slogan \u2018Bring it Home\u2019 made no sense, and 27\u202f% felt the campaign was too negative.\n\nARI\u2019s final question asked whether Poilievre should remain leader or be replaced.  Overall, 64\u202f% of respondents favored Poilievre staying on, while 22\u202f% wanted him voted out, a nearly 3\u2011to\u20111 ratio in his favour.  The majority of respondents across all provinces, age groups, and genders supported his continued leadership.\n\nThese numbers suggest that while Poilievre retains a majority of support among Canadians and Conservatives, a notable minority\u2014especially within his own party\u2014expresses criticism that could surface at the upcoming convention.\n\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[The Walrus](https://thewalrus.ca/pierre-poilievres-hardest-test-yet-his-own-party/)\n\n**Pierre Poilievre Wins By-Election, Returns to Ottawa as Conservative MP**\nPierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, won the by-election on Monday with over 80% of the vote.

He spent several weeks in the new riding meeting with voters, attending events, and visiting local businesses. 'In fact, the whole process has been very effective,' he said. Poilievre's campaign focused on door-to-door canvassing and community events, a strategy he used in his first election in 2004. He will return to the House of Commons on September 15 and will face off against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Poilievre has promised to introduce a bill called the 'Canada Sovereignty Act' and has pledged to support the construction of several major infrastructure projects, including pipelines and a highway.

Poilievre has mastered the art of parliamentary jousting, as he has demonstrated during Justin Trudeau's tenure. However, his return to the Commons does not mean that his ordeal is over, as he will now face even more daunting challenges in the next five months. He will have to convince Canadians that he is the best leader to lead the country, while also convincing his own party members that he is the right person to lead them into the next election. The Conservative Party's support has been declining in recent months, and Poilievre will have to work hard to regain the ground lost to the Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney. The Liberal Party has been adopting some of the Conservative Party's policies, making it harder for Poilievre to differentiate himself.

According to a report by the National Post, a source close to Trudeau revealed that voters will choose a new MP on August 11 or 18. The source, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that Trudeau will fulfill his promise to quickly announce the by-election results and avoid 'political games' so that the by-election can be completed before the House of Commons reconvenes in mid-September, rather than being delayed until December or January. The source added that the election will be held on August 11 or 18, as the first Monday in August is Alberta Heritage Day and it is a principle not to disturb that day. Pierre Poilievre lost his seat in the Carleton riding in Ottawa in the federal election on April 28 and therefore cannot enter Parliament to ask questions.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014ranging from election modeling and political consulting to journalism, political science, sociology, and Canadian studies\u2014there is a strong consensus that Pierre Poilievre is highly unlikely to become Prime Minister of Canada before January 1, 2026. All experts cite the recent April 2025 federal election, which returned a Liberal minority government under Mark Carney with 169 of 343 seats, as a major stabilizing factor. The status quo is reinforced by the Liberals' ability to gain ad hoc support from smaller parties (NDP, Bloc), the lack of indication of government collapse or imminent snap election, and historically low base rates for opposition leaders becoming PM mid-term, especially immediately after losing a general election and personal seat. Poilievre faces additional headwinds: an imminent Conservative leadership review in January 2026 and internal dissent over his leadership style. While acknowledging the inherent (if small) instability of minority governments and the slim possibility of a destabilizing event (e.g., major scandal or confidence vote loss), nearly all experts agree the timeline is too tight for these to realistically result in Poilievre's ascension given electoral and parliamentary logistics. The only plausible scenarios for a 'yes' outcome require highly improbable combinations of government crisis, rapid election, and immediate Conservative victory or an unprecedented cross-party accord. Individual probability estimates by experts mostly fall in the 1-8% range, with some higher (around 23%) to account for extreme black swan events, but the dominant rationale remains that structural, historical, and procedural barriers make a Poilievre premiership before 2026 extraordinarily unlikely.",
