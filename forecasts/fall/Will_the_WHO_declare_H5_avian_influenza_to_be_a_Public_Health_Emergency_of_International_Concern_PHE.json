In 2023\u20132025, despite large animal outbreaks and some spillover events (notably U.S. cattle), WHO consistently rated risk as low for the public. The PHEIC is reserved for events with clear international spread or potential for such, and with significant risk to human health. The IHR update in September 2025 elevates the required threshold for emergencies and may marginally decrease use of the PHEIC for warning purposes given the new upper 'pandemic emergency' category. The current context includes heightened One Health surveillance and pandemic preparedness, but also no sign at present (based on available news, docs, and surveillance) that H5 has moved meaningfully closer to efficient human-to-human transmission. Nevertheless, post-COVID, the threshold for invoking a PHEIC if concerning clusters or international spread do arise may be somewhat lower, and there is global political sensitivity about underreacting. Taking these factors together, and noting that the most likely 'Yes' scenario (mutation leading to limited human-to-human transmission, perhaps in poultry workers or in a mammal-to-mammal cluster, followed by international spread) has not materialized, the base rate still heavily favors 'No.' However, the nontrivial risk of surprise viral evolution means this probability cannot be placed very close to zero\u2014especially with about 15 months to go. My overall estimate is thus slightly above the historical base rate (which is in the 5\u201310% range for past years):",

The WHO's own risk assessments remain conservative, and the base rate for escalating animal influenza to PHEIC is near zero in the absence of dramatic human epidemiological developments. The newly available 'pandemic emergency' category above PHEIC may slightly reduce the propensity to use PHEIC for 'near-miss' zoonoses with pandemic potential. However, the situation is being closely watched and global pandemic preparedness workflows are on alert, so if a threshold event (such as human clusters) emerges, the probability would change rapidly. Given about three months remaining and the absence of evidence for a decisive epidemiological shift, the likelihood of a PHEIC declaration on H5 before 2026 is low but non-negligible and higher than in a totally quiescent period due to extraordinary surveillance focus and rapid international communication.

Second, the acknowledgment of potential for rapid, unforeseen viral evolution\u2014especially with elevated One Health surveillance and high-impact spillover events in animals\u2014captures the dual biological and governance domains where surprises could force a swift WHO emergency response.

For example, the forecaster correctly notes the lack of precedent for a PHEIC for H5, but recent months have featured epizootic outbreaks with mammalian spillover (notably in cattle in the US, which is unprecedented in scale), raising the global baseline risk above what was present in prior years. In addition, the increase in international multi-sectoral workshops, One Health surveillance, and public risk communications is not merely 'preparedness signaling,' but also creates an environment where institutional overreaction is somewhat more likely if events escalate. Thus, by pegging only a minimal adjustment above the historical base rate, the forecaster may underweight the current window's elevated tail risks and the changed global governance climate.

Their reasoning is further strengthened by recognizing that the introduction of a 'pandemic emergency' category above PHEIC, while new, likely further dampens pressure to declare for borderline events\u2014thus reinforcing the practical conservatism with which the WHO handles PHEIC for influenza viruses. They also appropriately caution about tail risks due to mutation, but correctly keep the baseline estimate low given the time remaining and the nature of typical WHO escalations. This is a well-justified, evidence-based approach from the bench science perspective."

Pre-pandemic workshops and cross-sectoral collaborations do often serve as preparedness, but they also prime both public health systems and the WHO to spot and respond to weak signals or novel events quicker than in the past. If, for example, a novel mammalian cluster or a credible international animal-to-human transmission event were reported even late in 2025, these integrated systems could mobilize unprecedentedly fast pressure for a PHEIC\u2014especially if geopolitical or media pressure grows. The reasoning in this forecast somewhat overstates preparedness as a dampening factor, rather than recognizing its dual potential to hasten policy action in high-alert periods. Therefore, a slightly higher probability could be justified\u2014not because the fundamental base rate is wrong, but because the evolving international context arguably makes even a short, closing window less inert than the pre-COVID era."

Their observation that global alert levels and surveillance create awareness but not necessarily triggers for declaration is consistent with WHO\u2019s behavior even when under external pressure. They also judiciously note the short time window and the very low likelihood of both emergence and detection of a transmissible human H5 event before 2026.

Importantly, they do not discount the tail risk of sudden viral evolution, but correctly weight these as unlikely against the backdrop of the upcoming short time window. Their use of a probability band (5\u201315%) incorporates scenario uncertainty without inflating the forecast, demonstrating prudent calibration grounded in both epidemiological precedent and recent public health governance changes.

From the virology (pathogenicity) perspective, this distinction is critical: WHO analytically separates zoonotic epizootics from true pandemic threats, and history underscores that PHEICs are only declared when there is credible, contemporaneous evidence of immediate human health risk across borders. Their explanation also astutely incorporates the context of the new 'pandemic emergency' category, which further diminishes the odds of a 'borderline' event being upgraded to a PHEIC. Moreover, their approach acknowledges that should a compelling cluster emerge, the assessment could rapidly change, yet they calibrate their probability (8%) appropriately for the absence of any such events as of October 2025. This synthesis of evolving governance structure and biological realism is methodologically strong and aligns well with evidence-based risk assessment."

From my virology (zoonotic spillover) perspective, the strength here lies in the understanding that, even with severe epizootic events and occasional alarming animal-to-mammal spillovers, the bar set by the WHO Emergency Committee for a PHEIC\u2014namely, clear, present, and cross-border human risk\u2014has not been met for H5, and procedural conservatism strongly supports caution. Their emphasis that \"all relevant news sources emphasize preparedness rather than crisis\" is especially apt: even increased animal outbreaks and mammalian events have so far only galvanized preparedness, not crisis-level international health coordination. The argument's tail-risk caveat is appropriately sized: while the short window leaves some room for surprise, the core institutional, epidemiological, and virological conditions for a PHEIC remain absent.

The deliberations largely agree on the fundamental factors: lack of human transmission, new IHR category possibly raising the PHEIC bar, strong global attention, but minimal concrete escalation.

Precedent in recent years shows that WHO is somewhat more sensitive to escalation in a context of increased attention and ambiguity, especially when facing mounting international concern\u2014a lesson from mpox and other recent PHEICs. While the base rate remains low and no evidence of sustained human-human transmission yet exists, the convergence of high-impact mammalian spillover events, increased surveillance, and institutional alertness marginally raises the tail risk of a PHEIC before 2026.

Critiques raised of the lowest forecasts argue that a slightly higher probability is justified by the unique animal-to-mammal H5 events and the elevated institutional and media sensitivity since COVID-19, which could lead to more rapid escalation if a risk signal appears. At the same time, the base rate for PHEIC for H5 is effectively zero, and despite global concern, there is still no sign of efficient human-to-human transmission. The new 'pandemic emergency' tier above PHEIC is likely a moderating influence but does not eliminate the possibility of a PHEIC for an equivocal or precautionary signal, especially given a compressed news cycle.

Slight upward adjustments are advocated by a few for heightened tail risk due to expanded One Health surveillance and incremental increases in mammalian spillover, with some noting that post-COVID institutional and political dynamics could accelerate action if an unexpected cluster emerged. However, even the highest group forecasts (13%) only marginally exceed the historical base rate. Having re-examined my original rationale in light of critiques and defenses, I remain convinced that the probability should be above the absolute base rate, but not materially higher, given that no new epidemiological signal has emerged and time is very short before the question resolves.

Critiques suggested that One Health networks could, in theory, accelerate escalation in case of weak signals, but this is offset by the strong inertia shown by the WHO to avoid over-declaring. The short time window (<3 months) and current absence of triggering events further strengthens the case for a very low, but not zero, probability\u2014especially as no plausible Yes pathway was identified outside highly unlikely tail-risk scenarios.

Some participants justified slightly higher forecasts to hedge against institutional 'hair-trigger' response post-COVID and increased mammalian spillover, but these effects are marginal over such a short horizon and, if anything, reinforce the importance of waiting for hard human-case evidence.

The original question opened on 2024-12-12 17:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/30763). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAccording to the WHO, the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations (IHR) [consists](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/emergencies-international-health-regulations-and-emergency-committees) \"of international experts who provide technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a 'public health emergency of international concern' (PHEIC).\" Important factors the Emergency Committee weighs in its deliberation process are:\n\n1. risks to human health\n2. international spread of the outbreak, and\n3. interference with international travel.\n\nThe final determination of a PHEIC is made by the Director-General of the WHO.\n\nIn recent years, the WHO has declared a PHEIC for the [2022-2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_mpox_outbreak) and [2023-2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%932024_mpox_epidemic) mpox outbreaks, the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), the 2018-2020 [ebola outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivu_Ebola_epidemic), and the 2015-2016 [Zika epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Zika_virus_epidemic).\n\nWith respect to H5, at the time of this question the WHO [assesses the risk](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON512) as follows:\n\n> Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in birds, there is a risk for sporadic infections in mammals and humans due to exposure to infected animals (including livestock), or contaminated environments and thus, further human cases are not unexpected.  Influenza A infection has been rarely reported in bovine species and spread among dairy cattle herds in four U.S. States is being assessed. Previously, there have been human infections with other avian influenza subtypes following exposure to infected mammals.\n\n> Since the virus has not acquired mutations that facilitate transmission among humans and based on available information, WHO assesses the public health risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons the risk of infection is considered low-to-moderate.\n\n> There are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5 infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (from human cases and animal) and comprehensive investigations around human cases are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.\n\nFor more information please see:\n\n* US Centers for Disease Control [H5 Bird Flu: Current Situation](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html)\n* WHO [Risk assessments and summaries of influenza at the human-animal interface](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/avian-influenza/monthly-risk-assessment-summary)\n* Pan American Health Organization [Epidemiological alerts and updates](https://www.paho.org/en/epidemiological-alerts-and-updates)\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

Three deaths have been reported since the outbreak began on May 15, 2025, with one person currently hospitalized. Cases have been confirmed in all 16 regions and approximately 100 districts across the country. The GHS emphasized it remains vigilant, actively monitoring the outbreak through its surveillance system and coordinating with the Ministry of Health to implement public health measures, including contact tracing. Director General Prof. Samuel Kaba Akoriyea urged the public to remain calm, stating that existing protocols for detecting, managing, and controlling infectious diseases are being rigorously followed. The GHS advised the public to practice good hygiene, avoid close contact with symptomatic individuals, refrain from touching rashes or body fluids, use protective gear when caring for the sick, and report suspected cases. Symptoms of Mpox include rash, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. The GHS recommended frequent handwashing, wearing masks, covering lesions, keeping skin dry, avoiding shared items, disinfecting shared spaces, and using saltwater rinses for mouth sores. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Mpox a public health emergency of international concern in August 2024 due to a new variant spreading across Africa. Over 13 African countries have reported cases, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and 517 deaths recorded on the continent by the end of 2024.

In October 2025, a new wave of infections\u2014designated the 15th\u2014has emerged in Europe and the United States, driven by the XFG variant, a descendant of Omicron labeled 'Frankenstein.' In France, there has been a 16% weekly increase in suspected adult cases and a 17% rise among children aged 2 to 14 since September. The XFG variant now dominates viral circulation in Europe and the U.S., contributing to this resurgence. Experts from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (Cidrap) had previously predicted a pattern of recurring peaks and troughs in infections, confirming that the virus continues to follow this cyclical trend. In France, the 2025 vaccination campaign for vulnerable populations begins on October 14, with continued recommendations for the elderly and high-risk individuals due to the vaccine\u2019s proven protection against severe illness and long Covid. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Robert Kennedy Jr., a known anti-vaccine figure appointed by the administration, has led experts to question the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, rejecting official recommendations. Globally, the persistence of Covid-19 underscores the urgent need for pandemic preparedness. The World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) pandemic agreement, adopted in May 2025, aims to improve global coordination by ensuring equitable access to vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics, strengthening national health systems, enhancing surveillance and data sharing, and establishing mechanisms for international response during health emergencies.

The funds, requested to support efforts until June 2016, will be used to fast-track vaccine development, improve diagnostics, and study virus transmission and control. WHO declared a global public health emergency in February 2016, noting the virus's shift from a minor threat to a serious concern due to its association with severe complications. The requested funds include $25 million for WHO and its regional offices, with the rest allocated to partners like UNICEF. Initially, WHO used a $2 million emergency contingency fund to launch operations. Georgetown University professor Lawrence Gostin criticized the limited emergency fund, citing the slow WHO response during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak, which killed over 11,300 people. Brazil, the hardest-hit country, reported over 4,442 suspected microcephaly cases, with 508 confirmed and 41 linked to Zika infection. No treatment exists for Zika, which was previously considered a mild illness. However, research progress is underway: 15 companies and academic groups are developing vaccines, and Inovio Pharmaceuticals reported a robust immune response in mice, causing its shares to rise 7% on the news. The company plans to begin human trials by year-end.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2016 08:56 PM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/02/17/who-seeking-56-million-to-help-fight-zika-hope-of-vaccine-moves-forward.html)\n\n**Ghana's Mpox cases rise to 670 with three deaths**\nAs of October 8, 2025, Ghana has recorded 670 cases of Mpox, including 13 new infections, according to the Ghana Health Service (GHS). Three deaths have been reported since the outbreak began on May 15, 2025, with one person currently hospitalized. Cases have been confirmed in all 16 regions and approximately 100 districts across the country. The GHS emphasized it remains vigilant, actively monitoring the outbreak through its surveillance system and coordinating with the Ministry of Health to implement public health measures, including contact tracing. Director General Prof. Samuel Kaba Akoriyea urged the public to remain calm, stating that existing protocols for detecting, managing, and controlling infectious diseases are being rigorously followed. The GHS advised the public to practice good hygiene, avoid close contact with symptomatic individuals, refrain from touching rashes or body fluids, use protective gear when caring for the sick, and report suspected cases. Symptoms of Mpox include rash, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. The GHS recommended frequent handwashing, wearing masks, covering lesions, keeping skin dry, avoiding shared items, disinfecting shared spaces, and using saltwater rinses for mouth sores. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Mpox a public health emergency of international concern in August 2024 due to a new variant spreading across Africa. Over 13 African countries have reported cases, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and 517 deaths recorded on the continent by the end of 2024. The WHO approved an Mpox vaccine in 2024 to improve access for millions at risk, as the outbreak has now infected over 20,000 people in Africa.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 09:23 PM\nSource:[Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd.](https://www.modernghana.com/news/1438780/ghanas-mpox-cases-rise-to-670-with-three-deaths.html)\n\n**Covid-19: Still Present After Five Years**\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, though no longer dominating media headlines due to competing global crises, remains active five years after the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In October 2025, a new wave of infections\u2014designated the 15th\u2014has emerged in Europe and the United States, driven by the XFG variant, a descendant of Omicron labeled 'Frankenstein.' In France, there has been a 16% weekly increase in suspected adult cases and a 17% rise among children aged 2 to 14 since September. The XFG variant now dominates viral circulation in Europe and the U.S., contributing to this resurgence. Experts from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (Cidrap) had previously predicted a pattern of recurring peaks and troughs in infections, confirming that the virus continues to follow this cyclical trend. In France, the 2025 vaccination campaign for vulnerable populations begins on October 14, with continued recommendations for the elderly and high-risk individuals due to the vaccine\u2019s proven protection against severe illness and long Covid. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Robert Kennedy Jr., a known anti-vaccine figure appointed by the administration, has led experts to question the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, rejecting official recommendations.

Experts warn that respiratory disease outbreaks have surged two months earlier than usual, highlighting ongoing threats from respiratory infections. According to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC), reported cases of COVID-19 and influenza have reached the highest levels in three years, with continued increases in influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection rates. Dr. Zhang Fengyi, President of the Taiwan Society of Infectious Diseases, emphasized that while COVID-19 has transitioned from a global acute pandemic to a\u5e38\u6001\u5316 (\u5e38\u6001\u5316 means 'normalization') endemic disease, it remains a serious threat. Multiple respiratory pathogens\u2014including influenza, RSV, and Streptococcus pneumoniae\u2014are now co-circulating, posing a heightened risk to individuals aged 65 and older, with co-infections potentially doubling mortality rates and increasing severe cases, thereby straining healthcare capacity. To mitigate risks, Dr. Zhang advocates for a 'three-line defense' strategy: widespread vaccination, routine rapid antigen testing, and early use of antiviral medications. Dr. Hsieh Hsien-sen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Taiwan Society of Infectious Diseases, reported that vaccination rates among high-risk groups remain low: only 20.3% of those aged 65+ received the JN.1 booster, 43.9% received the 2024 seasonal flu vaccine, and only 24.9% completed the two-dose pneumococcal vaccine series by April 2025.

The guidance emphasizes that travelers must undergo temperature checks and medical inspections at entry points, and cooperate with customs on epidemiological investigations and medical examinations if needed, to determine potential infectious disease exposure and enable early treatment while reducing transmission risks. During travel, passengers are advised to wear masks properly in prolonged, enclosed, crowded public transport settings to reduce the risk of respiratory infections. Upon returning home, individuals should conduct self-health monitoring; if symptoms such as cough, fever, rash, or diarrhea occur, they should seek medical care promptly and inform healthcare providers of their travel history. This guidance aligns with the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism\u2019s recent notice, 'On Doing a Good Job in the Prevention and Control of Key Infectious Diseases, Including COVID-19, During and After the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival and in the Autumn-Winter Season,' which calls for unified thinking, heightened awareness, and proactive planning to ensure the overall stability of the national epidemic situation, supporting a favorable environment for socioeconomic development.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 09:36 AM\nSource:[news.cn](http://www.news.cn/politics/20251007/2c83e400d7c24a46b3a40ab872faac81/c.html)\n\n**Avian Influenza Outbreak Sparks Global Alarm: Spain Activates Emergency Protocol, Brazil Becomes Hotspot with 17,000 Chickens Dead**\nThe avian influenza virus has caused widespread fear and concern globally, particularly in Europe and Latin America. Spain activated a health emergency protocol after detecting a new outbreak in Alcobendas, following multiple cases in Andalusia, and ordered the culling of over 850 birds. Experts, including Spanish immunologist Alfredo Correl, emphasize that while human transmission remains rare\u2014only around 900 cases recorded globally since 1997\u2014the virus is highly lethal in poultry, causing 100% mortality among infected birds, and has a 30% to 50% fatality rate in confirmed human cases. Crucially, the virus currently does not spread from person to person, and experts believe it is unlikely to mutate for human-to-human transmission in the near future, as it benefits from host survival. Authorities stress that infected birds and all nearby poultry must be destroyed to prevent spread, and the public is advised not to touch dead birds and to wash hands thoroughly if contact occurs. Spain has identified nine outbreak sites, including in Seville\u2019s Parque Mar\u00eda Luisa and La Puerta del R\u00edo, with fears of further spread. In Brazil, the virus has become a major outbreak hotspot, with approximately 17,000 chickens dying in Rio Grande do Sul and preventive culling of remaining birds. Brazil has suspended poultry exports to the European Union, Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay; the EU partially lifted the ban after stabilization. Multiple Brazilian states have reported outbreaks, raising alarms over potential spread to large farms if preventive measures are not improved. Although human cases remain rare, experts from Spain and Latin America warn of 'shared risks' if the virus mutates to spread between species or appears in mammals.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:32 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/10/7/%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A5%D9%86%D9%81%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B2%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87/7146691)\n\n**Suriname Prepares for Bird Flu with International One Health Workshop**\nSuriname has launched a three-day One Health Workshop on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Utopia Heritage, running from October 6 to October 9, 2025.

According to a LocalCircles survey, 69% of households in the area report at least one person with flu-like symptoms. Dr. Rituja Ugalmugle of Wockhardt Hospitals confirms H3N2 is the predominant variant, noting widespread circulation. Symptoms include sudden high fever, chills, sore throat, runny nose, dry or productive cough, severe fatigue, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal issues, especially in children. High-risk groups\u2014children, the elderly, pregnant individuals, and those with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease\u2014are most vulnerable. While most cases resolve within a week, complications such as bronchitis, pneumonia, or worsening of pre-existing conditions can occur, with some patients requiring hospitalization. Dr. Mayanka Lodha Seth of Redcliffe Labs emphasizes that H3N2 is typically more severe and longer-lasting than common flu or colds. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, blue lips or nails, confusion, and severe dehydration, requiring immediate medical attention. Preventive measures include handwashing, masking, avoiding crowds, healthy eating, and annual flu vaccination. There is no specific antiviral treatment; care focuses on symptom relief, with antivirals reserved for severe or high-risk cases. H3N2 originated from the 1968 pandemic, combining with an avian H3 virus, and has since evolved through human adaptation. A 2024 study found that receptor-binding changes in H3N2 have increased transmissibility and immune evasion. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently assesses the pandemic risk as low, but vigilance is ongoing due to H3N2\u2019s rapid mutation potential. Scientists monitor the virus closely, as significant mutations could lead to a sudden epidemic or pandemic.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 02:27 PM\nSource:[taiwannews.com.tw](https://taiwannews.com.tw/news/6209513)\n\n**WHO Enacts New Regulations**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) announced that on Friday the new International Health Regulations (IHR) went into force, allowing the declaration of 'pandemic emergencies' for severe global health crises such as the COVID\u201119 pandemic.

WHO Director\u2011General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the threat remains and that global vigilance must continue, saying, 'This decision is based on sustained declines in cases -- as seen in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in other affected countries including Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda.' The emergency committee, which reviews Mpox status quarterly, lifted the PHEIC based on consistent evidence of falling infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda. The designation was first declared in August 2024 due to a more virulent Clade Ib strain. WHO clarified that lifting the emergency tag does not mean the virus is eradicated; high\u2011risk groups such as children, pregnant women and people living with HIV remain at higher risk of severe illness.\n\nWHO\u2019s latest surveillance update up to 31 March 2025 reports 137,892 confirmed cases (Jan\u202f2022\u2011Mar\u202f2025) and 317 deaths. The African Region accounts for 84.8\u202f% of cases, Europe 8.6\u202f%, and the Americas 5.6\u202f%. Notably, the African Region saw a 14\u202f% decline in cases in March\u202f2025 alone.\n\nIndia has reported about 40 confirmed Mpox cases and one death over the past five years, with the first case detected in Kerala in July\u202f2022. In late\u202f2024 to early\u202f2025, 10 cases of a newer Mpox strain were identified, mostly linked to travel or close contact with travellers. While India\u2019s caseload remains low compared to global figures, health officials emphasize continued vigilance and contact tracing.\n\nMpox is caused by the Monkeypox virus, part of the Orthopoxvirus family. The illness typically lasts two to four weeks, beginning with fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a rash that develops into blisters and scabs, often affecting the face, hands, feet or genital area.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 07:49 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/health/mpox-no-longer-a-global-emergency-but-who-warns-against-complacency-125090800441_1.html)\n\n**WHO: Mpox no longer an international health emergency**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

The Director\u2011General noted a sustained decline in cases and deaths in heavily affected countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, but emphasized that the removal of the emergency label does not mean the disease has been eradicated. He added, 'Mpox is still present, and countries must not let their guard down.'\n\nIn Kenya, mpox remains a growing concern. Ministry of Health data reported more than 314 confirmed cases by early August 2025, spread across 22 counties. Later humanitarian health updates indicated the tally had surpassed 330 cases in at least 24 counties, with Mombasa accounting for nearly half of the total. The coastal city and the Mombasa\u2011Malaba transport corridor have become epicentres of transmission, with many cases traced to truck drivers, sex workers, and their close contacts. The nation has reported several fatalities linked to the disease, underscoring the continued threat despite the WHO's declaration.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) confirmed that new surges were observed in Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania, even as weekly confirmed cases fell by 52\u202f%. The WHO declared the outbreak a PHEIC in August 2024; since May\u202f2022, more than 100 countries and regions worldwide have reported mpox cases. The article stresses that flare\u2011ups may still occur and that ongoing surveillance and response capacity are essential, especially for vulnerable groups such as young children and people living with HIV. Mpox is a viral zoonotic disease with initial symptoms of fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain and swollen lymph nodes, which can progress to widespread rashes; most infected individuals recover within weeks, though severe illness or death can occur.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 01:17 AM\nSource:[Social News XYZ](https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/09/05/who-says-mpox-no-longer-a-global-public-health-emergency/)\n\n**Mpox no longer a global health emergency, WHO says**\nOn September\u202f5\u202f2025, the World Health Organization announced that mpox is no longer a global public health emergency. The agency had declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in August\u202f2024 after a mutant clade\u202f1b strain spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to neighbouring countries. A panel concluded that the situation no longer meets the criteria for a PHEIC, citing declining case numbers and deaths in the DRC, Burundi, Sierra\u202fLeone, and Uganda. WHO Director\u2011General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference that 'This is based on case numbers and deaths steadily declining in the DRC and other affected countries, including Burundi, Sierra\u202fLeone, and Uganda,' and that 'We also have a better understanding of the drivers of transmission, the risk factors for severity, and the most affected countries have developed a sustained response capacity.' He added that lifting the declaration does not mean the threat is over. Globally, more than 34,000 mpox cases have been confirmed since the start of the year, with 138 deaths. The DRC and Sierra\u202fLeone have been hardest hit. Case numbers have dropped 76\u202f% since the epidemic peak, but sporadic outbreaks continue in West, East, and Central Africa. Kenya has begun a vaccination campaign after a recent rise in cases. The WHO and Africa CDC will continue coordination of vaccination and surveillance, focusing on high\u2011risk groups such as young children and people living with HIV. Mpox spreads mainly through close contact, and the case fatality rate in the DRC is about 3\u202f%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 03:51 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mpox-no-longer-global-health-155111733.html)\n\n**WHO Holds Fourth Emergency Meeting on Mpox Outbreak**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) held its fourth emergency meeting on the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) concerning the resurgence of mpox (monkeypox) in 2024. The meeting was held on June 5, 2025, and was attended by 16 members and 2 advisors of the IHR Committee. The WHO Director-General welcomed the participants and presented the objectives of the meeting, which were to determine whether the mpox outbreak still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and to formulate recommendations for temporary measures for States Parties. The WHO presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, including the circulation of all clades of the monkeypox virus (MPXV). The meeting discussed the recent developments in the mpox outbreak, including the stabilization or decline of cases in most provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the decrease in cases in Burundi, and the recent surge in cases in Sierra Leone. The WHO also presented its evaluation of the risk for different clades of MPXV, which includes a high risk for the DRC and neighboring countries, a moderate risk for the DRC, a moderate risk for Nigeria and countries in West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic, and a moderate risk for the world. The meeting also discussed the progress made in the fight against mpox, including the launch of vaccination campaigns in seven countries and the upcoming launch in four other countries. However, the WHO emphasized that the current progress is threatened by a growing funding deficit, which compromises not only the response efforts but also global health programs that support mpox prevention and control activities.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 10:04 AM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/quatrieme-reunion-du-comite-durgence-du-reglement-sanitaire-international-2005-concernant-la-recrudescence-de-la-mpox-variole-simienne-en-2024)\n\n**Global Health Alert: WHO Declares) Mpox a Public Health Emergency | Per Second News**\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the ongoing rise in cases, including a recent increase in West Africa, and likely ongoing undetected transmission in some countries beyond the African continent. According to WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the decision was made after the fourth meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee, which advised that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC. Ghebreyesus stated, 'Ongoing operational challenges in responding to the event, including concerning surveillance and diagnostics, as well as a lack of funding, make prioritising response interventions challenging and require continued international support.' The WHO has issued revised temporary recommendations to member states experiencing Mpox outbreaks to guide countries' efforts to prevent and control the spread of the disease.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 10, 2025 11:58 AM\nSource:[persecondnews.com](https://persecondnews.com/2025/06/10/global-health-alert-who-declares-mpox-a-public-health-emergency/)\n\n**Meet The Scientist Warning The World About The Next Pandemic - Health Policy Watch**\nDr. Tulio de Oliveira, leader of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation at Stellenbosch University and a key figure in identifying the Beta and Omicron variants of COVID-19, warns that global health preparedness must remain a top priority despite the world's shift in focus away from the pandemic. In an interview with Dr. Garry Aslanyan, Oliveira emphasized that global health is a moral responsibility requiring constant vigilance, collaboration, and investment. He highlighted how climate change is exacerbating health crises\u2014such as dengue outbreaks in Ethiopia and cholera in Malawi\u2014due to extreme weather, flooding, and increased human mobility, which heighten the risk and severity of epidemics. Oliveira stressed that pathogens do not respect borders and that cutting global health funding is short-sighted and dangerous. His advice to the global health community is to stay focused, deliver results, and never underestimate the power of preparedness. The interview was published on February 5, 2025, by Health Policy Watch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[healthpolicy-watch.news](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/meet-the-scientist-warning-the-world-about-the-next-pandemic/)\n\n**New Mpox strain sparks global health emergency**\nOn August 13, 2024, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention declared the Mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a public health emergency of continental security, and the World Health Organization followed on August 14, declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak, which may have begun in September 2023, is driven by a newly identified lineage, 'clade Ib', that is more efficient at human\u2011to\u2011human transmission than the previously known 'clade II' strains. The virus has spread across most DRC provinces and crossed national borders, overwhelming a health system already strained by Ebola, cholera and limited resources. Africa CDC estimates the continent needs about 10\u202fmillion doses of the Mpox vaccine, yet only roughly 200\u202f000 are currently available. The only approved vaccine, MVA\u2011BN (Modified Vaccinia Ankara\u2011Bavarian Nordic), is costly and largely unaffordable for many African countries. WHO has called for international solidarity, noting that Europe has the capacity to help but the supply gap remains a critical barrier. In June 2024, the World Health Assembly adopted amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) to improve global preparedness, though they have not yet taken effect. WHO has identified an immediate funding need of $15\u202fmillion for surveillance, preparedness and response, but has released only $1.45\u202fmillion from its contingency fund. The article stresses that addressing Mpox requires coordinated vaccine access, strengthened testing and monitoring, health\u2011care service improvement, public\u2011health education, behavioral change promotion, and economic support for affected communities. It concludes that global health security depends on collective action and sustained investment to prevent future outbreaks from escalating into worldwide crises.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 24, 2024 06:07 PM\nSource:[weeklyblitz.net](https://weeklyblitz.net/2024/08/25/new-mpox-strain-sparks-global-health-emergency/)\n\n**WHO Seeking $56 Million to Help Fight Zika, Hope of Vaccine Moves Forward**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called for $56 million to combat the rapidly spreading Zika virus, which has been confirmed in 39 countries and linked to birth defects such as microcephaly and neurological disorders like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The funds, requested to support efforts until June 2016, will be used to fast-track vaccine development, improve diagnostics, and study virus transmission and control. WHO declared a global public health emergency in February 2016, noting the virus's shift from a minor threat to a serious concern due to its association with severe complications. The requested funds include $25 million for WHO and its regional offices, with the rest allocated to partners like UNICEF. Initially, WHO used a $2 million emergency contingency fund to launch operations. Georgetown University professor Lawrence Gostin criticized the limited emergency fund, citing the slow WHO response during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak, which killed over 11,300 people. Brazil, the hardest-hit country, reported over 4,442 suspected microcephaly cases, with 508 confirmed and 41 linked to Zika infection. No treatment exists for Zika, which was previously considered a mild illness. However, research progress is underway: 15 companies and academic groups are developing vaccines, and Inovio Pharmaceuticals reported a robust immune response in mice, causing its shares to rise 7% on the news. The company plans to begin human trials by year-end.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2016 08:56 PM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/02/17/who-seeking-56-million-to-help-fight-zika-hope-of-vaccine-moves-forward.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts assign a low but non-zero probability to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring H5 avian influenza a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) before 2026. Consensus reasoning emphasizes that, as of October 2025, H5 avian influenza is causing major outbreaks in poultry and occasional mammalian infections, but sustained human-to-human transmission\u2014the principal historical trigger for a PHEIC\u2014has not occurred. WHO and global surveillance maintain that public risk remains low, particularly for the general populace; spillover to humans remains rare and occupational. Experts agree that the base rate for a PHEIC declaration in similar circumstances is extremely low: despite decades of H5 outbreaks and periodic animal-to-human spillover, WHO has never declared a PHEIC for avian influenza. The recent amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR)\u2014which now create a higher 'pandemic emergency' category above PHEIC\u2014may raise the bar further, implying a more conservative approach to the PHEIC tool absent clear evidence of increased human threat. \n\nSeveral factors could plausibly increase the probability, such as a sudden mutation enabling efficient human-to-human spread, new clusters of unexplained human cases, or major disruptions to international health or trade. Experts note post-COVID political sensitivities might make WHO react faster to ambiguous but concerning signals, yet assert that without clear, extraordinary developments (like a dramatic jump in human cases), the probability remains anchored by precedent and current assessments. Some note that increased One Health preparedness and surveillance reduce the likelihood of an emergency surprise. Probability estimates among forecasters range from 6% to 13%, with all emphasizing that\u2014for a PHEIC to occur\u2014the virus must show new, imminent threats to human health, which so far is not supported by surveillance or WHO statements. The dominant scenario resulting in a PHEIC would involve sudden epidemiological or virological shifts; in their absence, the base case (no declaration) is strongly favored.",
