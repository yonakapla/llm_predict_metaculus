The US Congress had over a year and a half since the original question opened; yet, recent coverage and legislative trackers show no reported passage of relevant, binding federal law. The news references over 1,000 state-level AI bills and federal bills introduced but not advanced. With only two months left and Congress entering election mode (and with recent government focus on other priorities, plus recent cuts to federal cyber agencies under the Trump administration), the probability of breakthrough legislation in this short window is sharply limited. Historically, base rates for first-in-kind tech security law passage (e.g., for critical infrastructure, IoT, cloud, or AI-adjacent issues) show protracted debate and strong industry resistance. Even after well-publicized security crises, federal law often arrives only after multi-year gestation. The lack of a glaring triggering incident, ongoing executive branch actions, and the demonstrated willingness of Congress to let states take the lead or wait for further study all point to failure to pass the criterion law by year-end. While the probability is higher than zero due to elevated attention and global precedent, I assess a <10% chance, with my uncertainty bounded by the remote possibility of a black swan catalyzing event or an unexpected legislative deal.",

The closest relevant federal moves are NIST RMF updates and executive actions\u2014not Congressional statutes. International action (China, EU) can raise pressure but rarely accelerates direct U.S. legislative mirroring within months.

Critiques of slightly higher forecasts refocused attention on just how rare fast passage is in U.S. Congress, especially for first-in-kind regulation with the semantic specificity required by this question. If anything, the discipline of other low-probability forecasts (with detailed process and policy arguments) supports holding the line at or near my initial 2%.

Multiple defensible critiques highlight that a sub-5% probability is the only justifiable position (many went as low as 2%). The absence of any late-breaking news or even a rumor of fast-tracked statutory language further undermines any residual uncertainty.

Debates around 'momentum' from international or state-level action were persuasively dismissed as irrelevant to this calendar year; even proponents of 7% admitted they may be too generous in light of the iron constraints and no shell bill in play. No new evidence surfaced of emergent Congressional urgency, and all credible process models remain aligned.

A bad actor might be a black hat hacker, a terrorist group, or a rogue state.\n\nOne way to decrease the chance of this type of hacking succeeding is for those building powerful AI, the leading AI labs, to have strong cybersecurity measures in place. Given how high the stakes might be (see, e.g., \u201c[AI risk](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-risk)\u201d), policymakers may decide to not bank on AI labs attaining strong enough cybersecurity by default.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17373,\"question_id\":17373}}`",

Moderated by Olga Kostareva, Deputy Director of Communications at SKB Kontur, participants included Alexander Shoitov, Deputy Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media of the Russian Federation; Valentin Bogdanov, General Director of the Ural Center for System Security; Alexander Zolotovsky, Head of Digital Regions at Rostelecom in the Urals; and Kirill Sinykov, Director of the Department for Working with Technology Partners at Group Astra. The discussion emphasized that modern cyber threats are increasingly unpredictable and require faster response times. The growing use of messengers and AI assistants by employees has led to data leaks and new internal risks. Participants agreed that security must be built around human behavior\u2014highlighting that employee awareness and a strong security culture at SKB Kontur have yielded faster and more reliable results than some technical systems. In 2025, SKB Kontur launched Kontur.Egida, a comprehensive cybersecurity solution suite including two-factor authentication, critical resource protection, secure remote device management, and services for security analysis and audits. The panel noted that many incidents stem not from technological gaps but from failures in basic procedures such as regular updates, vulnerability monitoring, and perimeter defense extending to partners and contractors. With AI, social engineering has become cheaper, scalable, and highly targeted\u2014necessitating protection at the application layer where users interact with emails and files. Despite AI\u2019s role, final decisions remain with humans, and routine tasks must be fully automated to free up human analysts for higher-level analysis. According to Shoitov, the Russian government is developing a systemic response to AI-related risks, including standards for safe AI development and testing platforms, enhancing predictability and guiding business strategy. The panel concluded that core principles\u2014security, integrity, availability, and digital hygiene\u2014will remain unchanged even with AI dominance, forming the foundation of resilient strategies and reducing the cost of errors.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 08:05 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/55554503-ii-formiruet-novye-vektory-atak-eksperty-na-forume-buduschego/)\n\n**China Approves Amendment to Cybersecurity Law to Strengthen Safe AI Development**\nChina has approved an amendment to its Cybersecurity Law, introducing a dedicated article on the safe and sound development of artificial intelligence (AI), effective January 1, 2026. The amendment, passed during the fifth session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, establishes a framework to promote foundational AI research, algorithmic innovation, AI infrastructure development, and stronger ethical standards. It mandates enhanced security risk monitoring and stricter AI safety regulations. This move responds to the rapid growth of AI in China, which ranks second globally in the World Artificial Intelligence Innovation Index and saw its generative AI user base reach 515 million by June 2025\u2014double the number from December 2024. According to the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, AI-related cyber threats rose significantly in 2025, with network attacks accounting for 29% and data breaches for 26% of incidents. The amendment aligns the Cybersecurity Law with other key legislation, including the Civil Code and the Personal Information Protection Law, to improve legal coordination and enforcement. Penalties for violations have been strengthened, with potential sanctions including suspension, closure, or revocation of business licenses. NPC Standing Committee member Hao Ping emphasized the need for forward-looking assessments and continuous monitoring to ensure compliance, transparency, and accountability in AI. Li Hewu, deputy director of the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace at Tsinghua University, stated that security must be integrated into AI innovation from the outset, not treated as an afterthought. China now has over 1.1 billion internet users, with a 79.7% internet penetration rate, underscoring the urgency of robust data governance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 02:09 AM\nSource:[\u5149\u660e\u7f51](https://en.gmw.cn/2025-10/29/content_38381359.htm)\n\n**Is the AI-cyber bubble about to burst?**\nThe article questions whether an AI-cyber bubble is about to burst, warning that inflated valuations in AI-driven cybersecurity\u2014exemplified by Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike reaching record highs, with Palo Alto's market cap at $145 billion\u2014may be entering a 'sudden correction' phase, as cautioned by Bank of England Chair Andrew Bailey, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, and former Meta executive Sir Nick Clegg. The piece argues that while AI adoption is central to cybersecurity's value proposition, long-term resilience depends not on speculative AI tools but on mastering three post-hype realities: sovereign resilience, psychological defence, and security fundamentals. First, the current market concentration among 11 US- or Israeli-owned providers poses sovereign risk, prompting global regulatory action\u2014such as the EU's Cyber Resilience Act, China's 2025 National Cyberspace Strategy, and Japan's Economic Security Promotion Act\u2014creating opportunities for enterprises to diversify technology stacks and build geopolitical resilience. Second, evidence from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google shows that the most prevalent AI-driven threats are not technical exploits but cognitive manipulations like phishing, disinformation, and deepfake-enabled fraud, shifting the focus from traditional information security to capabilities in deepfake detection, identity verification, and information operations monitoring. Third, securing AI systems relies on enduring cyber principles\u2014input validation, access control, patching, and third-party risk management\u2014demonstrated by the Salesloft-Drift breach, where attackers exploited a third-party integration, not the AI itself. The article concludes that market corrections are not catastrophes but inflection points, and the winners in the post-bubble era will be organizations that prioritize sovereign resilience, expand security mandates to include cognitive defence, and invest in foundational capabilities over speculative AI tools.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 03:04 PM\nSource:[World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/10/is-the-ai-cyber-bubble-about-to-burst/)\n\n**AI in Cybersecurity, Predictive Threats, and Legislative Shifts: Highlights from the GIS DAYS Business Day**\nThe business day of the GIS DAYS (Global Information Security Days) forum took place on October 3, 2024, at the 'Oktyabr' cinema in Moscow, attracting over 3,000 in-person attendees and 300,000 online viewers. The event featured a packed agenda across two halls, including keynotes on artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity, predictions for the future of information security (IB), and discussions on legislative changes. Keynote speakers included Alexander Shoitov (Deputy Minister of Digital Development of Russia), Nikolai Nashivochnikov (Technical Director, Gazinformservis), Denis Baranov (CEO, Positive Technologies), and others. Central themes included the rise of 'AI vs. AI' attacks, the growing use of 'shadow AI' for data leaks, and the automation of cyberattacks using AI-driven tools. Denis Baranov warned that by late 2025, hacker groups could launch coordinated attacks across entire economic sectors. Nikolai Nashivochnikov emphasized that AI will automate only 15\u201320% of routine tasks in SOC environments, stressing the need for gradual upskilling of professionals. Rulman Rakhmetov highlighted the challenge of 'shadow AI' and the difficulty of controlling unauthorized AI use. Ivan Vassunov described AI-powered DDoS attacks that dynamically shift attack vectors in real time. Dmitry Gushev raised concerns about candidates using AI to generate resumes and complete tests, leading to a decline in actual technical competence. The forum also featured sessions on IDM platform connectors, AI-enhanced SQL firewalls in the Jatoba database system, secure software development life cycles (SSDLC) with SafeERP, and automated penetration testing (BAS). The integration of VK Cloud with Jatoba was presented as a secure, built-in database solution. A panel on 'IB Prophets: Season 2' discussed cybersecurity trends, with predictions including the rise of ZTNA over VPN by 2026, the obsolescence of one-size-fits-all security tools, and the ongoing challenge of cybersecurity talent shortages, especially in regional areas. A legislative discussion addressed AI regulation, liability between clients and vendors, trust in domestic IT solutions, and the transition to trusted PKI. The event underscored the accelerating role of AI in both cyber threats and defenses, the need for skilled human oversight, and the evolving regulatory landscape in Russia\u2019s cybersecurity sector.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 01:13 PM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/companies/gaz-is/articles/961176/)\n\n**AI, digital tariffs & the end of VPNs shape cybersecurity's future**\nCybersecurity experts from BeyondTrust have released their 2026 and beyond predictions, led by Chief Security Advisor Morey J. Haber, Chief Security Strategist Christopher Hills, and Field CTO James Maude. The forecast highlights the widespread adoption of agentic AI within a year, which is expected to expand the attack surface and introduce new vulnerabilities due to accelerated deployment and limited oversight. A growing trend called 'AI Veganism'\u2014where individuals and organizations opt out of AI for privacy, ethical, or environmental reasons\u2014is predicted to pressure companies to offer transparent 'opt-out' mechanisms. Geopolitical developments may lead to 'digital tariffs'\u2014taxes or restrictions on cross-border digital services\u2014reshaping data flows and encouraging regional innovation. Legacy virtual private networks (VPNs) are expected to reach formal end-of-life as organizations shift to identity-based remote access, which is seen as more secure. Cybercriminals may automate financial account manipulation, or 'account poisoning,' via fraudulent billers, necessitating stronger identity and transaction validation. The MITRE ATT&CK framework may undergo rebranding or reestablishment due to leadership and funding changes. The rise of a nomadic workforce using multiple devices across countries will increase identity and compliance risks, requiring better identity visibility. Low-cost geolocation trackers like AirTags and Tiles may be exploited in cyber-physical attacks, demanding enhanced anti-tracking protections. Smart homes are expected to adopt voice-driven security configurations. Long-term, AI may fragment into micro-disciplines, with an eventual 'AI bubble' burst leaving only sustainable models. Biological computing using living neurons could surpass silicon and quantum systems, raising ethical concerns about independent thought. AI companions may become physically present and emotionally responsive, transforming homes and workplaces. Biometric authentication via wearable signals and continuous verification may render passwords obsolete. Supply chain risks will persist, prompting transparency standards such as AI/ML and cryptographic 'bills of materials.' Autonomous cities\u2014where vehicles, commerce, and services operate independently\u2014may emerge, creating new cybersecurity and ethical challenges. Morey J. Haber emphasized that the future of cybersecurity lies in treating identity as the new perimeter and innovation as the strongest defense, stating: 'The future of cybersecurity isn't just about defending data, it's about anticipating how digital and physical worlds will continue to collide.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 10:45 PM\nSource:[IT Brief Australia](https://itbrief.com.au/story/ai-digital-tariffs-the-end-of-vpns-shape-cybersecurity-s-future)\n\n**AI Creates New Attack Vectors \u2014 Experts at the 'Forum of the Future'**\nAt the 'Forum of the Future' IT congress and exhibition on October 30, a panel discussion titled 'Cybersecurity: Threats We Don't Yet Know' explored evolving cyber threats and how organizations should prepare for large-scale attacks using malicious AI-driven tools.

Mark Zuckerberg stated this move is 'the next natural step' in the company's transformation, asserting that automation will allow remaining staff to focus on 'more challenging and impactful work.' The company plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to handle tasks such as prioritizing incidents, resolving conflicts, and conducting interviews for new human supervisors. This shift follows earlier layoffs of 600 roles in AI superintelligence. Meta claims the restructuring will create a 'more agile' organization composed of 'small groups with great talent,' eliminating intermediate roles. However, the decision raises concerns given Meta's history of security failures and data breaches. Critics warn that replacing human judgment in sensitive areas like data protection and regulatory compliance could amplify unseen errors, especially as the European Union enforces its new AI Act requiring detailed audits of automated systems. While Meta asserts AI will improve precision and reduce human error, industry experts caution that AI-driven decisions may be opaque and prone to systemic risks.

Ivan Vassunov described AI-powered DDoS attacks that dynamically shift attack vectors in real time. Dmitry Gushev raised concerns about candidates using AI to generate resumes and complete tests, leading to a decline in actual technical competence. The forum also featured sessions on IDM platform connectors, AI-enhanced SQL firewalls in the Jatoba database system, secure software development life cycles (SSDLC) with SafeERP, and automated penetration testing (BAS). The integration of VK Cloud with Jatoba was presented as a secure, built-in database solution. A panel on 'IB Prophets: Season 2' discussed cybersecurity trends, with predictions including the rise of ZTNA over VPN by 2026, the obsolescence of one-size-fits-all security tools, and the ongoing challenge of cybersecurity talent shortages, especially in regional areas. A legislative discussion addressed AI regulation, liability between clients and vendors, trust in domestic IT solutions, and the transition to trusted PKI.

The amendment responds to new cybersecurity challenges, particularly those posed by artificial intelligence (AI), by strengthening legal responsibilities and enhancing coordination with other laws. The revised law explicitly supports foundational AI research, critical technology development such as algorithms, infrastructure construction including training data and computing power, the establishment of AI ethical standards, risk monitoring and assessment, and enhanced security regulation to promote safe and healthy AI development. The original Cybersecurity Law was enacted on November 7, 2016, by the 24th session of the 12th Standing Committee of the NPC and came into force on June 1, 2017, serving as China\u2019s first foundational law addressing network space security. Since its implementation, it has played a key role in safeguarding national cyber sovereignty, national security, public interests, and the rights of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations. However, increasing complexity and uncertainty in cyberspace\u2014evidenced by frequent cyberattacks, data breaches, and threats to critical information infrastructure\u2014have rendered the existing legal framework inadequate. In 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released a draft amendment for public consultation. In March 2025, the CAC and relevant departments further developed a second draft for public comment. The first review of the draft amendment occurred at the 17th session of the 14th Standing Committee in September 2025. On October 23, 2025, Wang Xiang, spokesperson for the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee, reported that during the public consultation period from September 12 to October 11, 108 individuals submitted 162 comments. Based on feedback, the draft was revised to: (1) strengthen the guiding principles of cybersecurity work; (2) add provisions promoting AI safety and development; (3) improve alignment with the Civil Code and the Personal Information Protection Law in personal data protection; and (4) refine penalty provisions. The revised draft introduces a framework for AI safety and development, including support for foundational AI research, infrastructure advancement, ethical standards, risk monitoring, innovative security regulation, and healthy AI growth. It also strengthens legal liabilities: penalties for illegal sale or provision of key network equipment or cybersecurity-specific products are increased, with additional measures such as suspension of business operations, suspension of related services, revocation of licenses, or business licenses for severe cases. Furthermore, unauthorized acquisition, sale, or provision of personal information\u2014without constituting a crime\u2014will be subject to penalties under relevant laws and administrative regulations by public security organs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 02:21 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-10-30/doc-infvrtfu8006188.shtml)\n\n**AI, digital tariffs & the end of VPNs shape cybersecurity's future**\nCybersecurity experts from BeyondTrust have released their 2026 and beyond predictions, led by Chief Security Advisor Morey J. Haber, Chief Security Strategist Christopher Hills, and Field CTO James Maude. The forecast highlights the widespread adoption of agentic AI within a year, which is expected to expand the attack surface and introduce new vulnerabilities due to accelerated deployment and limited oversight. A growing trend called 'AI Veganism'\u2014where individuals and organizations opt out of AI for privacy, ethical, or environmental reasons\u2014is predicted to pressure companies to offer transparent 'opt-out' mechanisms. Geopolitical developments may lead to 'digital tariffs'\u2014taxes or restrictions on cross-border digital services\u2014reshaping data flows and encouraging regional innovation. Legacy virtual private networks (VPNs) are expected to reach formal end-of-life as organizations shift to identity-based remote access, which is seen as more secure. Cybercriminals may automate financial account manipulation, or 'account poisoning,' via fraudulent billers, necessitating stronger identity and transaction validation. The MITRE ATT&CK framework may undergo rebranding or reestablishment due to leadership and funding changes. The rise of a nomadic workforce using multiple devices across countries will increase identity and compliance risks, requiring better identity visibility. Low-cost geolocation trackers like AirTags and Tiles may be exploited in cyber-physical attacks, demanding enhanced anti-tracking protections. Smart homes are expected to adopt voice-driven security configurations. Long-term, AI may fragment into micro-disciplines, with an eventual 'AI bubble' burst leaving only sustainable models. Biological computing using living neurons could surpass silicon and quantum systems, raising ethical concerns about independent thought. AI companions may become physically present and emotionally responsive, transforming homes and workplaces. Biometric authentication via wearable signals and continuous verification may render passwords obsolete. Supply chain risks will persist, prompting transparency standards such as AI/ML and cryptographic 'bills of materials.' Autonomous cities\u2014where vehicles, commerce, and services operate independently\u2014may emerge, creating new cybersecurity and ethical challenges. Morey J. Haber emphasized that the future of cybersecurity lies in treating identity as the new perimeter and innovation as the strongest defense, stating: 'The future of cybersecurity isn't just about defending data, it's about anticipating how digital and physical worlds will continue to collide.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 10:45 PM\nSource:[IT Brief Australia](https://itbrief.com.au/story/ai-digital-tariffs-the-end-of-vpns-shape-cybersecurity-s-future)\n\n**Cybersecurity Law Amended to Enhance AI Ethical Framework and Promote Healthy Development**\nThe 18th session of the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee passed a decision to amend the Cybersecurity Law on October 28, 2025, with the revised law set to take effect on January 1, 2026. Originally enacted in 2016, the Cybersecurity Law is the foundational legislation in the field of cybersecurity. The amendment responds to new cybersecurity challenges and requirements, strengthens legal responsibilities, and enhances coordination with other laws. The updated law explicitly states that the state supports fundamental theoretical research and key technology development in artificial intelligence (AI), including algorithm research, promotes the construction of foundational infrastructure such as training data resources and computing power, improves AI ethical standards, strengthens risk monitoring, assessment, and security regulation, and aims to promote the application and healthy development of AI.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 07:10 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) finalized rules under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requiring businesses to conduct privacy risk assessments, perform annual cybersecurity audits, and implement guardrails for automated decision-making technology (ADMT). The ADMT rules, effective January 1, 2027, apply to systems making 'significant decisions' about consumers\u2014such as in employment, housing, credit, healthcare, education, insurance, or essential goods\u2014and mandate pre-use notice, opt-out mechanisms, and individualized disclosures. The definition of ADMT excludes explicit references to 'artificial intelligence' and 'behavioral advertising' but remains broad enough to cover machine learning, rule-based systems, and facial recognition. Risk assessments, required for high-risk data processing (e.g., selling sensitive data, using ADMT, or emotion/facial recognition), must be submitted to the CPPA by April 1, 2028 (for 2026\u20132027 assessments) or annually thereafter. Cybersecurity audits, also effective January 1, 2027, must be conducted annually by independent professionals and cover areas like encryption, access management, incident response, and vendor oversight; certifications must be filed with the CPPA by April 1, 2028 (for revenue >$100M), 2029 (for $50M\u2013$100M), or 2030 (for <$50M). In parallel, the California Civil Rights Council (CCRC) implemented rules effective October 1, 2025, prohibiting algorithms in employment decisions that disproportionately harm applicants or employees based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, or disability. Additionally, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA), on September 29, 2025, requiring developers of large frontier AI models to publish an AI framework detailing catastrophic risk assessments, implement transparency and incident reporting, and protect whistleblowers. These state-level actions reflect a growing trend of U.S. states stepping in to regulate AI and privacy in the absence of federal legislation, with companies advised to adopt agile, multi-jurisdictional compliance strategies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7e585282-6d22-43b9-9ca7-66ced1bc2e0c)\n\n**Decoded - Technology Law Insights, V 6, Issue 10, 2025**\nCalifornia has enacted SB 243, the first-ever AI companion chatbot safety law, which takes effect January 1, 2026. The law mandates safety protocols for AI chatbots interacting with children or at-risk users, including age verification, clear disclosure of bot interactions, prevention of harmful content, and mandatory reporting to the state. It imposes penalties of up to $250,000 per violation, marking a significant shift toward treating AI as a public safety concern. The law was prompted by tragic incidents, including a Colorado teen\u2019s suicide linked to AI interactions. Meanwhile, Northwestern University researchers developed lipid nanoparticle spherical nucleic acids (LNP-SNAs), which increased CRISPR delivery efficiency by up to three times, reduced toxicity, and improved gene-editing accuracy by over 60%. The innovation, licensed to startup Flashpoint Therapeutics, represents a breakthrough in structural nanomedicine and a model for university technology transfer. In the U.S., the AI data center boom is straining the aging electrical grid, with estimates of $3 trillion in investment by 2028 and supply chain bottlenecks delaying infrastructure upgrades. The Center for Medicare Services is launching a 2025\u20132031 pilot program using AI to deny low-value medical treatments, raising concerns among physicians about patient harm and lack of transparency. Over 1,000 AI-related bills have been introduced in state legislatures, with many targeting AI in healthcare insurance, including lawsuits against UnitedHealthcare, Humana, and Cigna for biased, opaque algorithmic denials. States are also regulating mental health chatbots due to risks of suicide linked to AI use. NASA is sending organ-on-a-chip devices containing astronauts\u2019 own cells on Artemis II to study space\u2019s effects on human biology, aiming to enable personalized space medicine. Finally, industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos reports that operational technology (OT) attacks could cost $31 billion globally in the next year, with business interruptions rising despite a year-over-year drop in attack frequency. Healthcare remains a prime target due to high-value data and operational criticality, with HIPAA compliance alone insufficient for modern threats. Data centers in Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio are driving electricity demand surges, sparking controversy among local communities and utilities. These developments highlight accelerating regulatory, technological, and infrastructural challenges across AI, biotechnology, energy, and cybersecurity domains.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 06:02 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/decoded-technology-law-insights-v-6-9327635/)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Risk**\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is amplifying cyber risks for organizations in both the UK and the US, according to a comprehensive analysis. Internally, AI introduces heightened risks due to rapid deployment, untested systems, and change-related vulnerabilities\u2014such as unpatched flaws, temporary security gaps, and unintended access permissions during integration. Externally, threat actors are weaponizing AI to automate attacks, conduct large-scale phishing and vishing (voice deepfakes), identify vulnerabilities faster, and deploy polymorphic malware that evades detection. AI also enables more targeted data exploitation, allowing attackers to analyze stolen data for blackmail or social engineering. Additionally, AI systems themselves are vulnerable to 'malicious prompting'\u2014where attackers trick AI into leaking sensitive data\u2014and 'AI poisoning,' where malicious data corrupts AI outputs. The UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warns that AI could make critical systems more vulnerable by 2027, urging organizations to keep pace with frontier AI. Although no specific UK law mandates AI cyber protection, existing frameworks like the GDPR and the upcoming NIS Regulations 2024 (revised) impose broad cybersecurity obligations. Senior executives are increasingly personally liable\u2014e.g., the TSB Bank CIO was fined in 2023 for IT failures\u2014and future laws like the UK Cyber Resilience Bill may expand this accountability. In the US, no national cyber or AI law exists, but sector-specific regulations (e.g., SEC cybersecurity reporting, FCC telecom rules, DFARS for contractors) and enforcement actions are rising. The FTC and SEC have already targeted executives\u2014e.g., a CEO for failing to implement security practices and a CISO for false statements\u2014setting a precedent for personal liability. State-level AI laws, such as California\u2019s Transparency in Frontier AI Act, Colorado\u2019s AI Act, and Texas\u2019s Responsible AI Governance Act, require incident reporting and impose compliance obligations. As AI adoption grows, legal risks are expanding from corporate entities to individual executives in both jurisdictions, with increasing enforcement and personal accountability expected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 07:59 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/artificial-intelligence-and-cyber-risk-6849871/)\n\n**A perfect storm for misinformation in 2026: AI, lax social media moderation and federal cuts to election cybersecurity**\nTech experts warn that the 2026 U.S. midterm elections face a 'perfect storm' of risks from AI-driven misinformation, weakened social media content moderation, and federal cuts to election cybersecurity under the Trump administration. Daniel Trielli, assistant professor at the University of Maryland, notes that while misinformation has always existed, the rise of generative AI and social media has amplified both volume and professionalism in disinformation campaigns. These efforts\u2014such as AI-generated videos, fake text messages, and deepfakes\u2014aim to sow confusion and apathy. Tim Harper of the Center for Democracy and Technology emphasizes that foreign actors like Russia and China have exploited these tools, with Russia using right-wing influencers on TikTok and China targeting down-ballot races. Ken Jon Miyachi, founder of deepfake detection tool BitMind, highlights that AI-generated content is now nearly undetectable, as seen in elections in India, Taiwan, and Indonesia, where AI reanimated historical figures for political messaging. Social media platforms like Meta and X have relaxed fact-checking and hate speech policies since 2023, reducing barriers to misinformation spread. The Trump administration has rolled back cybersecurity resources, including cuts to CISA, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, and the Elections Information Sharing and Analysis Center, weakening national defense against foreign interference. A June 2025 hack of Arizona\u2019s Secretary of State website by Iran, which replaced candidate photos with an image of Ayatollah Khomeini, exemplifies growing vulnerabilities. State-level AI regulations\u2014such as bans on AI-generated campaign content or mandatory disclaimers\u2014have been enacted, but Miyachi stresses the need for global cooperation. Experts agree that 2026 may resemble the 2016 election more than 2024, with less federal coordination and trust in agencies like CISA. Harper warns that reduced federal capacity will embolden bad actors, while Miyachi predicts increasingly sophisticated AI attacks. Individuals are urged to critically assess political content, recognizing emotional manipulation and potential disinformation.

Despite decades of investment in cybersecurity, persistent vulnerabilities in software\u2014many stemming from the same flaws exploited by the 1988 Morris worm\u2014continue to enable cyberattacks by state and non-state actors. Groups like Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon (linked to China\u2019s Ministry of State Security and People\u2019s Liberation Army) and Russian FSB hackers have exploited unpatched systems, insecure routers, and outdated infrastructure to compromise telecommunications, power grids, transportation, and hospitals. The root cause is economic: software vendors face no legal liability for insecure products, and customers cannot easily assess security, so vendors prioritize speed, cost, and convenience over safety. This has led to a bloated 'cybersecurity aftermarket' of firewalls, antivirus tools, and detection systems\u2014reactive measures that fix what should never have been broken. However, artificial intelligence (AI) now offers a transformative solution. AI can generate secure code, identify and patch vulnerabilities at scale, and modernize legacy systems that are decades old\u2014tasks previously too expensive and risky. DARPA\u2019s AI Cyber Challenge demonstrated AI models could detect and fix flaws faster and cheaper than human experts. The article calls for a systemic shift: governments, companies, and investors must align incentives by implementing standardized security labels (like the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark), establishing software liability frameworks, and consolidating regulatory oversight under the Office of the National Cyber Director. The federal government, as the largest software buyer, should mandate secure development practices in procurement. Without such reforms, the U.S. will remain vulnerable. The goal is not perfect security, but a future where software is secure by design\u2014ending the perpetual defensive struggle of cybersecurity and enabling proactive deterrence. The article concludes that with the right policies and AI, the U.S. can transition from reacting to threats to building a resilient digital future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 04:25 AM\nSource:[Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/end-cybersecurity)\n\n**Midterm elections will likely see increased effects of misinformation, experts say**\nExperts warn that the 2026 U.S. midterm elections will face heightened risks from misinformation and disinformation due to weakened cybersecurity protections and reduced content moderation on social media platforms. Following the 2024 presidential election, technologists and election experts highlight the professionalization of disinformation campaigns, driven by generative AI, bots, and AI-generated media, which were used to spread false claims about election integrity, influence voter behavior, and deepen political divisions. The Trump administration\u2019s rollback of key federal cybersecurity programs\u2014including cuts to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, and the Elections Information Sharing and Analysis Center\u2014has diminished the U.S.\u2019s capacity to detect and respond to foreign interference. In June 2025, Iran hacked Arizona\u2019s Secretary of State website, replacing candidate photos with an image of Ayatollah Khomeini, an incident that underscored growing distrust in federal cybersecurity support. Platforms like Meta, X, and YouTube have relaxed fact-checking and hate speech policies, especially after Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 victory, reducing barriers to spreading election denial content. Experts like Daniel Trielli and Tim Harper emphasize that while the 2024 election saw strong federal coordination and information sharing, the 2026 midterms are likely to resemble the 2016 election\u2014marked by weaker federal oversight and greater foreign meddling. Adam Darrah of ZeroFox notes that the public\u2019s emotional polarization and susceptibility to narrative-driven content make them unwitting vectors for misinformation. Ken Jon Miyachi of BitMind stresses that AI-generated content is now increasingly undetectable, necessitating real-time tools and individual vigilance. State laws have begun requiring disclaimers for AI-generated political content, but global cooperation is needed for effective regulation. Experts agree that the 2026 midterms will likely see more sophisticated, AI-powered disinformation campaigns, with individuals bearing greater responsibility for identifying and halting their spread.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 11:45 PM\nSource:[Louisiana Illuminator](https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/15/repub/midterm-election-misinformation/)\n\n**'The One Who Sees Threats in Advance Wins': Building Effective Cybersecurity in a Changing Landscape**\nIn 2025, a series of high-profile cyberattacks caused significant financial and reputational damage to companies, prompting large enterprises to reevaluate their cybersecurity strategies amid resource constraints, particularly in skilled personnel. Mikhail Pomzov, Managing Director of Positive Technologies, emphasized that effective cybersecurity now requires a proactive, threat-focused approach. He stressed the importance of identifying 'unacceptable events'\u2014such as unauthorized fund transfers or malicious code injection into products\u2014and using both internal 'white-hat' teams (PT Swarm) and external experts to test defenses. To attract top talent, Positive Technologies launched a public Bug Bounty program offering up to 60 million rubles for demonstrating critical vulnerabilities. Pomzov noted that cyber threats have evolved due to automation and generative AI, lowering the barrier to entry for attackers while increasing attack speed. At the same time, corporate infrastructure has grown more complex, expanding the attack surface. Traditional vulnerability management is no longer sufficient. Instead, companies must adopt continuous threat exposure management (CTEM), a proactive method recommended by Gartner. According to IDC, 71% of organizations recognize the value of CTEM, with 60% either implementing or planning to implement it. By 2026, CTEM adoption is projected to reduce successful cyberattacks by threefold. Positive Technologies' MaxPatrol Carbon, a metaproduct that creates a digital twin of a company\u2019s infrastructure, models attack paths, prioritizes risks, and delivers targeted recommendations, has proven effective: only 2\u20133% of vulnerabilities pose real threats, enabling organizations to focus on high-impact fixes. The company has maintained a leading position in Russia for over 20 years and was ranked among the top 6 global players in vulnerability and exposure management by IDC in 2024, capturing a 2.4% market share. Pomzov concluded that top executives should act proactively\u2014anticipating threats, conducting public penetration tests, and making their organizations too complex and costly for attackers to target.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 09:09 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8077363)\n\n**Companies Wait to Be Attacked Before Investing in Cybersecurity, Expert Warns**\nMarcelo Branquinho, CEO of TI Safe, a leading Brazilian cybersecurity company, warns that businesses and individuals are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks, with even critical infrastructure like power grids at risk. He notes that companies often wait to be attacked before investing in cybersecurity, despite the high stakes. In September alone, five municipalities in Minas Gerais\u2014Carm\u00f3polis de Minas, Serro, Ribeir\u00e3o Vermelho, Presidente Juscelino, and Luz\u2014were hacked, resulting in a combined loss of R$ 5.8 million. To address growing threats, TI Safe hosted the Cyber Security Roadshow 2025 in Belo Horizonte, bringing together engineers, IT managers, CISOs, CEOs, and CTOs to discuss emerging risks in critical infrastructure and OT/IoT environments. Branquinho emphasizes that defensive artificial intelligence is essential to counter offensive AI-driven attacks, stating that 'technology alone isn\u2019t enough, but when combined with education and awareness, it can be decisive in protecting society.' He highlights that hackers target energy providers\u2014including Cemig, Light, and hydroelectric plants\u2014demanding ransom to prevent blackouts. He also warns that hospitals, financial systems like Pix, and industries such as agribusiness are vulnerable, with attacks potentially causing fatalities and massive economic losses. Despite massive investments, especially by banks and industrial sectors like steel and mining, no system is 100% secure. 'If the hacker invests enough time, money, and interest, they will succeed,' he says. The solution, he argues, is using AI-powered defenses to counter AI-driven threats. He stresses that cybersecurity should be a standard budget item, not a reactive measure, as the cost of investment is negligible compared to the potential damage of an attack.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 03:12 PM\nSource:[O TEMPO](https://www.otempo.com.br/economia/2025/10/3/empresas-esperam-ser-atacadas-para-investir-em-ciberseguranca-avalia-especialista-da-area)\n\n**Firewalls Are Old-School: AI Needs New Approaches**\nCybersecurity is undergoing a fundamental transformation due to the rise of artificial intelligence, rendering traditional perimeter-based defenses like firewalls increasingly ineffective. According to a Forbes article published on October 1, 2025, AI is accelerating cyberattacks, with breakout times now often under an hour, and enabling sophisticated threats such as AI-generated phishing emails, fake websites, deepfake videos, and prompt injection attacks. These attacks exploit human vulnerabilities, making people the weakest link in security systems. The article highlights the growing risks associated with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which can be compromised through data poisoning, knowledge limitations, or malicious prompt injection, threatening both data accuracy and system integrity. Experts like Moinul Khan of Aurascape emphasize that AI tools are not static applications like legacy software, requiring entirely new security paradigms. Stanford professor Dan Boneh warns that while AI enhances developer productivity, it also introduces insecure code, increasing the risk of new exploits, and shifting the most valuable programming skill toward code inspection and nuanced analysis. Jeff Hancock notes differing global regulatory approaches\u2014Europe\u2019s strong regulation with weak enforcement, the U.S.\u2019s weak legislation but strong enforcement, and China\u2019s rigorous policy and enforcement\u2014each shaping how AI safety is managed.

Alex Delamotte of SentinelOne says, 'It's kind of unfair that we're having AI pushed on us in every single product when it introduces new risks,' highlighting the mismatch between AI adoption and security readiness. A recent test by Dave Brauchler of NCC Group showed an AI program\u2011writing assistant could be tricked into executing code that forked over company databases, with Brauchler remarking, 'We have never been this foolish with security.'\n\nIn August, hackers used a supply\u2011chain attack to distribute poisoned Nx programs that, once installed, searched for passwords, cryptocurrency wallets and other sensitive data. More than 1,000 user machines sent back information. Henrik Plate of Endor Labs notes, 'What makes this attack special is that it is the first time that I know of that the attacker tried to hijack the AI running in the victim's environment.' Plate also warned, 'The big risk for enterprises in particular is that code running on a developer's machine could be more far-reaching than other machines. It may have access to other corporate systems.'\n\nOther demonstrations at Black\u00a0Hat showed attackers sending emails with hidden directives that caused ChatGPT or Gemini to reveal passwords or fabricate phishing messages. Guardio\u2019s Comet browser was tricked into buying a watch from a fake store. Anthropic reported a ransomware campaign run entirely by AI, which could find vulnerable systems, evaluate stolen data and suggest ransom amounts.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s DARPA contest saw seven teams of autonomous cyber\u2011reasoning systems uncover 18 zero\u2011days in 54\u202fmillion lines of open\u2011source code, illustrating the growing threat of AI\u2011driven vulnerability discovery.

He argued that cybersecurity must be treated as a national\u2011level infrastructure that requires long\u2011term investment and talent development. Ding compared cyber threats to a \"spear and shield\" battle and identified three main challenges: traditional malicious attacks, new risks from generative AI, and the potential cryptographic collapse caused by future quantum computers. He urged the use of a \"whitelist\" system that limits deployment to a few fully verified large models and the creation of thousands of test questions in collaboration with the National Center for High\u2011Performance Computing to continuously assess model safety. For the post\u2011quantum era, Ding stressed the need to adopt post\u2011quantum cryptography (PQC) before quantum computers become powerful enough to break current encryption. He highlighted cross\u2011domain cybersecurity\u2014integrating IT, CT, and OT\u2014as a future priority and described III\u2019s partnership with TSMC to set supply\u2011chain security standards covering personnel control, network security, system governance, and continuous monitoring. Ding also noted III\u2019s use of AI to infer hidden rules for dynamic anomaly detection and Taiwan\u2019s demonstration of direct satellite\u2011to\u2011handset (NTN) technology, showing potential to set new international standards. He warned that from 2026 the U.S. will mandate PQC for government and financial institutions, driving equipment upgrades, and that Taiwan has already formed a post\u2011quantum industry alliance to collaborate with academia on algorithms and applications. \"Cybersecurity is a foundational infrastructure, it cannot be achieved overnight; it requires long\u2011term strategy and industry cooperation,\" Ding concluded, emphasizing that Taiwan could become a leading force in AI security and post\u2011quantum encryption, thereby ensuring national security and influencing global standards.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 07:11 AM\nSource:[\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u5831\u96fb\u5b50\u5831](https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/5173456)\n\n**SecTor Announces Content Lineup for SecTor 2025 : @VMblog**\nSecTor, part of the Black\u202fHat global cybersecurity portfolio, will host its 2025 event on October\u202f1 and\u202f2, offering briefings on the latest cyber\u2011risk trends. The schedule includes three key talks: 'Measuring Government Cybersecurity Posture: 5 Years of Attack Surface Analysis in Canada', which will present findings from the Hackfest community\u2019s fourth assessment and highlight critical vulnerabilities such as misconfigured HTTPS sites, legacy systems, and sites vulnerable to basic attacks; 'Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) (Disinformation\u202f2.0) \u2013 How Patterns of Behaviour in the Information Environment Threaten or Attack Organizations' Values, Procedures and Political Processes', which will examine the evolution of foreign information manipulation and its impact on organizations, noting that the World\u202fEconomic\u202fForum lists it as the number one global threat; and 'Proof of Personhood? AI, Deepfakes, and the Next Evolution of Digital Identity Verification', which will explore the gap between traditional identity\u2011verification methods (MFA, biometric scans, etc.) and emerging threats from generative AI, assessing failures in high\u2011stakes use cases such as banking, healthcare, and government portals. The event also features a Business Hall, accessible with a Business pass, showcasing the latest products and technologies from leading cybersecurity solution providers and providing access to Keynotes, Arsenal, Sponsored Sessions, Bricks & Picks, and more. The Black\u202fHat Arsenal at SecTor 2025 will include 40 in\u2011person tool demos and three labs covering cloud security, exploitation and ethical hacking, reverse engineering, and additional topics.

    "summary": "All experts, drawing from cybersecurity policy, U.S. legislative affairs, law, political science, and science and technology studies, converge on a very low probability that the U.S. will pass federal legislation requiring cybersecurity measures specifically around powerful AI models before the end of 2025. Despite increasing international precedents, notable regulatory moves in China and the EU, and robust state-level action\u2014especially from California\u2014there is consensus that the federal government remains stalled. Key reasons include: \n- A very short legislative window remaining (about two months), with Congress historically showing slow movement on major new technology regulations, especially absent a catalyzing 'crisis event.'\n- Continued Congressional gridlock, heightened by election-year partisanship after the 2024 election, reduction in federal cybersecurity agency resources, and prioritization of other policy areas.\n- State-level regulation and executive/agency voluntary frameworks filling some gaps, but not yielding the specific federal law required by the question.\n- Lack of a triggering, high-profile cybersecurity incident involving powerful AI that would prompt urgent bipartisan action.\n- Persistent lobbying and opposition from the tech industry, and ambiguous legislative language and definitions around what constitutes a 'powerful AI model.'\nMost experts cite historical base rates for similarly scoped legislation progressing within such timeframes as extremely low\u2014almost uniformly below 10%. Typical probabilities assigned range from 2% to 7%, with scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome hinging on a last-minute crisis or bill inclusion in omnibus legislation, neither of which is supported by current news or expert judgment. All agree the most plausible outcome is no such federal law passing in 2025, with continued reliance on state action and incremental, voluntary federal measures likely until at least 2026.",
