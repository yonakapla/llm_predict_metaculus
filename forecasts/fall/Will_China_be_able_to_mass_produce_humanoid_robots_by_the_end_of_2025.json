Technical limitations and definitional squishiness are real, but you act as though China\u2019s history of 'achieving the metric, even if only nominally' will suddenly fail just because this is robotics, not trains or 5G. Overplaying the requirement for Western auditability underestimates the likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome being declared, even if the reality is fuzzy."

The original question opened on 2024-02-25 02:58:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/19878). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n#### From the [ Humanoid robot Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot)\n\nA humanoid robot is a robot resembling the human body in shape. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body, for example, from the waist up. Some humanoid robots also have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as eyes and mouths. Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble humans.\n\n![Chinese robots](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/03/48249435-6ad4-4b8a-bd02-c43ede74bce4_55bf4566.jpg?itok=cYZpFgtd&v=1699004362)\n\n\n####Current progress\n\nBy 2025, China aims to establish an initial humanoid robot innovation system, achieving breakthroughs in crucial components such as \u201cbrains, cerebellum, and limbs,\u201d while ensuring a safe and efficient supply of core components. The production level for these robots is expected to reach an advanced international standard, with mass production occurring. These robots are anticipated to demonstrate their effectiveness across various fields, from manufacturing to livelihood services.\n\nAmong China's most advanced projects are those by Xiaomi and Fourier Intelligence. Xiaomi is working on its CyberOne, a robot that is supposed to be capable not only of perceiving space in 3D, but also of recognising individuals and interpreting their gestures, expressions and emotions. Combined with artificial intelligence, it could one day interact directly with humans. For its part, Fourier Intelligence is preparing to launch its first humanoid robot, the GR-1, specialised in medical actions, capable of moving at 5 km/h and carrying loads of several dozen kilogrammes. Its first deliveries are scheduled for 2024.\n\n####For more details on China's progress see:\n\n* https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/china-ministry-pushes-for-humanoid-robot-mass-production-by-2025-and-100-billion-market-by-2030.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\n* https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2023/11/09/china-aims-to-mass-produce-humanoid-robots-by-2027\n* https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3240259/china-says-humanoid-robots-are-new-engine-growth-pushes-mass-production-2025-and-world-leadership\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":19878,\"question_id\":19878}}`",

Standing 180 centimeters tall and weighing 70 kilograms, the H2 exhibits near-robotic dance-like agility, performing fluid movements including kung fu sequences, backward jumps, and spins with remarkable balance\u2014features that suggest a 31 degrees of freedom, an upgrade from the previous H1 model\u2019s 23. The robot, showcased in a video with digital facial expressions and clothing, is designed not just for functionality but to be charismatic, signaling China\u2019s shift from manufacturing utilitarian robots to creating emotionally resonant ones. The H1, its predecessor, gained national recognition after dancing Yangko at the 2024 Spring Festival Gala and was capable of speeds up to 5 meters per second. Equipped with 360\u00b0 depth cameras and LiDAR sensors, the H2 aims to demonstrate China\u2019s progress in autonomy, balance, and mechanical design. While China leads globally in industrial robotics\u2014installing nearly 300,000 units in factories in 2024\u2014the humanoid market remains nascent. The H2 is not yet designed for specific tasks but serves as a technological showcase and a symbol of national technological sovereignty. Unitree also markets the smaller, more affordable R1 model for developers and universities, which TIME named one of the best inventions of 2025. Through a dual strategy targeting both industrial innovation and educational outreach, Unitree aims to build a global ecosystem. Despite the robot\u2019s impressive aesthetics and viral appeal\u2014driving millions of views\u2014practical applications remain limited. Unitree\u2019s CEO, Wang Xingxing, states the current phase is one of exploration: understanding how robotics can coexist with society. The H2 thus functions as both a technical marvel and a political statement, reflecting China\u2019s integration of AI, robotics, and hardware into state-level strategy. As the robot performs its choreographed routines, a deeper question lingers: who are these robots really dancing for?\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 02:27 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo en Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.gizmodo.com/donde-antes-solo-habia-maquinas-ahora-hay-bailarines-de-metal-unitree-presenta-al-h2-su-robot-mas-humano-y-china-se-prepara-para-vender-el-futuro-2000199469)\n\n**The Era of Humanoids is Upon Us: A Strategic Race for Technological Supremacy**\nThe article discusses the rising global competition in humanoid technology, driven by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, which are rooted in a deeper struggle for technological supremacy. China's upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan (starting 2026) is expected to prioritize artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor self-reliance, smart manufacturing, supply chain and energy security, with 'new quality production forces' as a central concept. This initiative aims to address challenges from population decline by advancing automation and high-efficiency production, including the integration of humanoid robots beyond mere smart manufacturing. China aims to establish a core technology and component innovation system for humanoids by 2025 and is rapidly advancing in hardware mass production and cost optimization, while also pursuing brain-computer interface technology and developing supercomputers at primate-level cognitive capacity. Humanoids are increasingly seen as solutions not only for declining labor forces in manufacturing but also for caregiving shortages due to rapid aging and high-risk public service tasks. South Korea is also actively preparing, with the government, major corporations, and universities forming the 'K-Humanoid Alliance' in 2025. The country is establishing dedicated R&D centers, building domestic and international academic partnerships, and developing a full-cycle system from research to production and deployment, aiming for mass production and large-scale deployment by 2028\u20132029 to establish an independent humanoid technology ecosystem and gain global market leadership. Humanoids represent the convergence of AI, robotics, semiconductors, and battery technologies, making them pivotal in future national competitiveness.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 08:32 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025102134811)\n\n**L\u00fc Peng of Horizon Robotics: Advancing 'Human-like' Autonomous Driving to Achieve Full-Scale L4 by 2030**\nAt the 2025 World Intelligent Connected Vehicles Conference, L\u00fc Peng of Horizon Robotics emphasized that 'human-like' driving behavior\u2014resembling that of an experienced driver\u2014is essential for achieving 'usability' in intelligent driving systems, stating that both physical and psychological safety are critical. He argued that inconsistent or unpredictable driving actions disrupt not only the driver but also surrounding traffic. L\u00fc predicted that L4-level autonomous driving could be achieved by 2030, with L3 deployment possible by 2028 based on L4 capabilities. While urban assisted driving has expanded from premium vehicles to models priced as low as 150,000 RMB, it has not yet reached 'usable' standards due to persistent challenges in consistency, safety, and cost. L\u00fc stressed that current systems still require human intervention every 600\u20131,000 km on highways, far short of the 'near-million-kilometer' reliability required for L3. To bridge this gap, Horizon Robotics advocates for a 'Scale Up and Scale Out' strategy: leveraging L2-level mass production to generate real-world data, which fuels iterative improvements toward L4. This data-driven approach enables the definition of clear Operational Design Domains (ODD), such as 'all Beijing ring roads and national highways under all weather conditions,' allowing safe L3 activation. Horizon\u2019s next-generation L2 system uses end-to-end and reinforcement learning to mimic human driving behavior, achieving scene-agnostic operation, smooth control, and strong defensive driving capabilities. These features enhance psychological safety by reducing jerky braking, minimizing steering jitter, and enabling naturalistic responses in complex traffic scenarios. L\u00fc concluded that intelligent driving is entering a pivotal phase akin to the 4G era for smartphones, and once standardized, it will unlock broader innovation in smart cockpits and intelligent spaces. He urged both ambition and caution, given the safety-critical nature of the technology.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_6248544856_174713a58020026nkq.html)\n\n**YuShu Unveils 180cm Humanoid Robot H2: Capable of Ballet and Martial Arts, Resembles Sci-Fi Icons**\nYuShu Robotics unveiled its fourth humanoid robot, the H2, standing 180cm tall and weighing approximately 70kg\u2014marking a significant increase from the H1 model's 47kg. The H2 features 31 joints (12 in the arms, 14 in the legs, 3 in the torso, and 2 undisclosed functional joints), a 19% improvement over the R1's 26 joints. This enhanced joint count, combined with advanced balance and motion control algorithms, enables fluid, human-like movements. The robot demonstrates advanced capabilities including performing ballet with graceful hand and foot movements, executing martial arts routines with precision, walking, running, and even walking alongside humans in a fashion show. Its facial design has drawn comparisons to the robots in the film 'I, Robot' and the TV series 'Westworld,' evoking themes of human-robot coexistence.

He argued that inconsistent or unpredictable driving actions disrupt not only the driver but also surrounding traffic. L\u00fc predicted that L4-level autonomous driving could be achieved by 2030, with L3 deployment possible by 2028 based on L4 capabilities. While urban assisted driving has expanded from premium vehicles to models priced as low as 150,000 RMB, it has not yet reached 'usable' standards due to persistent challenges in consistency, safety, and cost. L\u00fc stressed that current systems still require human intervention every 600\u20131,000 km on highways, far short of the 'near-million-kilometer' reliability required for L3. To bridge this gap, Horizon Robotics advocates for a 'Scale Up and Scale Out' strategy: leveraging L2-level mass production to generate real-world data, which fuels iterative improvements toward L4. This data-driven approach enables the definition of clear Operational Design Domains (ODD), such as 'all Beijing ring roads and national highways under all weather conditions,' allowing safe L3 activation. Horizon\u2019s next-generation L2 system uses end-to-end and reinforcement learning to mimic human driving behavior, achieving scene-agnostic operation, smooth control, and strong defensive driving capabilities. These features enhance psychological safety by reducing jerky braking, minimizing steering jitter, and enabling naturalistic responses in complex traffic scenarios. L\u00fc concluded that intelligent driving is entering a pivotal phase akin to the 4G era for smartphones, and once standardized, it will unlock broader innovation in smart cockpits and intelligent spaces. He urged both ambition and caution, given the safety-critical nature of the technology.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_6248544856_174713a58020026nkq.html)\n\n**YuShu Unveils 180cm Humanoid Robot H2: Capable of Ballet and Martial Arts, Resembles Sci-Fi Icons**\nYuShu Robotics unveiled its fourth humanoid robot, the H2, standing 180cm tall and weighing approximately 70kg\u2014marking a significant increase from the H1 model's 47kg.

Like humans, humanoid robots have a skeleton (robust, lightweight body), muscles (high-power-density actuators), hands and feet (dexterous hands/performance legs), a heart (battery), a brain (human-machine interaction), and a cerebellum (motion planning and control). Chen noted that while China's humanoid robot technology and industry have seen rapid development\u2014robots can now dance, communicate freely, perform basic actions, and even sell goods\u2014major hurdles remain before they can enter real-life applications. For instance, at the humanoid robot half-marathon in Yizhuang, Beijing, in April 2024, the completion rate was below 30%, with most robots struggling with unstable gaits and frequent falls. Chen emphasized that the primary weakness is the 'cerebellum,' particularly in motion stability, making it unsafe to deploy robots in high-risk environments such as high-voltage areas or hospital wards without supervision. He compared the core of humanoid robots to industrial mother machines in manufacturing, asserting that motion control is the fundamental layer, requiring advances in sensing and intelligent skin to enhance the precision and stability of hands and feet, especially in dynamic movement. Beyond walking and running, hand and facial movements are highly complex: human facial expressions and hand movements involve dozens of degrees of freedom, enabling nuanced expressions and fine motor tasks like embroidery or surgery\u2014significant challenges. Market forecasts predict 18 million humanoid robots globally by 2035 and a $5 trillion global market by 2050, with China expected to be the largest single market at around 30%. Chen affirmed that while the future of humanoid robots is promising, the path is challenging. Currently, over 50 humanoid robot-related enterprises operate in Wuhan and surrounding areas, covering whole machine R&D, core component manufacturing, multimodal large models, and training facilities. Of these, 13 companies are in the robot whole-machine supply chain, and 27 have product supply capabilities, with notable strengths in electronic skin, inertial sensors, and cerebellum models. Over 70% of these companies are located in Guanggu, including Haicun Technology, Huaweike, and Yuansheng Innovation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 08:38 AM\nSource:[\u79d1\u5b66\u7f51](https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2025/10/553261.shtm)\n\n**Humanoid Robotics Industry: Entering a New Era of Growth and Empowering Diverse Sectors**\nHumanoid robotics in China is experiencing rapid development, transitioning from technical validation to large-scale commercialization, particularly during the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holiday in October 2025.

For example, Walker\u00a0S1 has been deployed for training on BYD and Dongfeng Luying production lines. \n- Logistics and warehousing (handling and sorting) represent a large potential market, with future expansion into commercial services and home use.\n\n**Stack architecture**: \n- Humanoid robots typically use a \"'\u5927\u8111 - \u5c0f\u8111 - \u80a2\u4f53'\" full\u2011stack design.  The \"'\u5927\u8111'\" handles high\u2011level planning and decision\u2011making; the \"'\u5c0f\u8111'\" manages real\u2011time motion control and balance; the \"'\u80a2\u4f53'\" executes physical interaction.  This modular, decoupled design balances general task capability with high\u2011frequency, real\u2011time control.\n\n**Hardware challenges**: \n1. **Cost and standardisation** \u2013 BOM costs remain high because joint modules and dexterous hands lack standardisation. \n2. **Mass production** \u2013 Leading firms can deliver only a few hundred to a thousand units by 2025; breakthroughs such as Fourier Intelligent\u2019s harmonic reducer and Yushu Technology\u2019s M107 joint motor are expected to lift production limits.\n3. **Endurance** \u2013 Typical robots run only a few hours.  GAC GoMate uses a solid\u2011state battery for 6\u2011hour operation, while PUDU D7\u2019s >1\u202fkWh battery supports over 8\u202fhours.\n\n**Software challenges**: \n1. **Generalisation** \u2013 No \"ChatGPT\u2011style\" model exists; the field suffers from limited data and representation power.  Zhiyuan Robot\u2019s GO\u20111 base model (ViLLA architecture) raises task success by 32\u202f%.  Figure\u2019s Helix\u202fVLA uses a \"'\u6162\u7cfb\u7edf+\u5feb\u7cfb\u7edf'\" mix to balance generalisation and real\u2011time control.\n2. **Data scarcity** \u2013 Motion and manipulation data are costly to collect.  NVIDIA\u2019s Cosmos platform generates synthetic physics\u2011based video data, while Galaxy Universal\u2019s GraspVLA trains on large synthetic datasets.\n3. **Real\u2011time and compute limits** \u2013 Current models run at ~50\u202fHz (e.g., \u03c00), below the desired 100\u202fHz for complex scenes.  Helix raises control frequency to 200\u202fHz, enabling the \"'\u5c0f\u8111'\" to react quickly to sudden events.\n\n**Key metrics**: \n- Tesla Optimus uses harmonic reducers; \n- Walker\u00a0S1 deployed on BYD/Dongfeng lines; \n- GoMate 6\u2011hour solid\u2011state battery; \n- PUDU D7 >1\u202fkWh battery for >8\u202fhours; \n- GO\u20111 improves task success by 32\u202f%; \n- Helix VLA achieves 200\u202fHz control.\n\nThe article presents a balanced, fact\u2011based overview of the current state and challenges of humanoid robot industrialisation.\n\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 05:44 AM\nSource:[tmtpost.com](https://www.tmtpost.com/7701202.html)\n\n**The Final Link in Mass\u2011Production of Humanoid Robots: A List of A\u2011Share Companies in the Dexterous Hand Supply Chain**\nThe Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology minister Yinh\u00e9jun announced that key technologies for humanoid robots\u2014multimodal perception and a brain\u2011cerebellum model\u2014have achieved breakthroughs, accelerating deployment in automotive manufacturing, logistics, and power inspection. Zhiyuan Robot and Yushu Technology secured a 1.24\u2011billion\u2011yuan contract with China Mobile (Hangzhou) for a 2025\u20112027 humanoid bipedal robot contract, the largest domestic order to date. Analysts predict 2025 will be the first year of mass production for domestic humanoid robots.\n\nA critical component is the \"dexterous hand,\" which determines the learning efficiency of the robot\u2019s brain model. Musk highlighted at the All\u2011In summit that Gen3\u2019s core focus is on the hand and forearm, underscoring its strategic importance. Tesla\u2019s latest Optimus video shows the hand moving toward finer, biomimetic iterations.\n\nIn the supply chain, planetary screw and tactile sensor segments dominate, accounting for 43.32\u202f% and 25.27\u202f% of value, respectively.

According to the author, the industry must first address three major bottlenecks: technical breakthroughs, supply chain collaboration, and business model innovation. Firstly, humanoid robots need to transition from 'mechanical mimicry' to 'human-like evolution' in terms of technology. This requires breakthroughs in key components such as lightweight materials, biomimetic muscles, and spherical joints. Companies like Ubitus (Hangzhou) Intelligent Robot Co., Ltd. and Shengdeng Power Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing) have made progress in these areas. Secondly, the ecosystem needs to shift from 'single-point breakthroughs' to 'collaborative breakthroughs'. Humanoid robots are complex systems that require collaboration between multiple stakeholders to produce. The author suggests establishing a more collaborative development mechanism between manufacturers and core component suppliers to accelerate technological iteration and cost optimization. Thirdly, the business model needs to transition from 'capital accumulation' to 'cost control'. High costs are the biggest obstacle to mass production, and achieving a commercial closed loop requires precise positioning of application scenarios and reducing costs to a reasonable range. The author suggests adopting a dual-drive model of scale-down costs and technological iteration, similar to the new energy vehicle industry. This can be achieved through design optimization, supply chain management, and manufacturing process innovation. Additionally, exploring flexible business models such as leasing, service sharing, and functional module subscription can help reduce the initial cost barrier and accelerate market verification and feedback loops.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 14, 2025 02:25 AM\nSource:[\u5343\u9f99\u7f51](https://finance.qianlong.com/2025/0814/8538267.shtml)\n\n**From 'Mechanical Arm' to 'All-Rounder': The Silent Revolution in Robotics**\nThe 2025 World Robot Conference is witnessing a silent revolution in the field of robotics. Robots are transitioning from laboratory 'technological wonders' to factory floors, showcasing their capabilities in intelligent manufacturing, modern agriculture, and home services. The driving force behind this revolution is the breakthrough in large language models. The '\u5929\u5de5Ultra' robot, for example, completed a half-marathon in 2 hours and 40 minutes and 42 seconds, demonstrating its ability to adapt to complex environments. The exhibition features multiple '\u5929\u5de5' robots working together to complete complex tasks, such as power line maintenance, assembly line sorting, and quality inspection. This technological breakthrough is attributed to the construction of a complete 'perception -- decision -- execution' intelligent closed-loop system, which enables robots to understand their environment like humans and make real-time adjustments. According to Wang Tianmiao, honorary director of the Beijing Aerospace Automation Research Institute, 'the emergence of large language models in 2022, which can simulate human brains and possess generalization and transferability, has driven the development of humanoid robots.' The market prospects are promising, with 50 robot companies showcasing mature commercial solutions at the conference. According to a report released by PwC on April 3, the global humanoid robot market is expected to grow from $2.03 billion in 2024 to $13.25 billion in 2029, with a compound annual growth rate of 45.5%. In China, the industrialization process is accelerating. New Sun Industrial Robot's '\u673a\u5668\u624b' has achieved a precision of 0.02 millimeters and has been applied in mass production of advanced chips, providing a crucial support for breaking the 'lack of chips and lack of soul' bottleneck. This revolution has far-reaching implications beyond the technical level. Like the steam engine in the 18th century, which liberated human physical labor, the 21st-century embodiment of intelligence is liberating machine intelligence. The development of humanoid robots is not only a technological advancement but also a new exploration of human production power boundaries. As the world faces global challenges such as climate change and population aging, intelligent robots have shown unique value. However, it is also necessary to perfect relevant ethical norms and social governance systems simultaneously. The leading edge of robot technology means the competition for industrial voice, military security, and international rule-making power, becoming an important variable in reshaping global strategic power balances. China has elevated the development of robot industry to a national strategy and has published relevant policy documents, such as the '14th Five-Year Plan for Robot Industry Development' and the 'Guiding Opinions on the Development of Humanoid Robots.' China is driving the development of humanoid robots with a 'policy support + technology breakthrough + scene landing' multi-round driving mode, fully leveraging the advantages of the new-type national system, and building a highland of humanoid robot innovation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 12:48 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-08-13/doc-infkutxe7300295.shtml)\n\n**\u4f17\u64ce Unveils First Heavy-Duty Humanoid Robot T800 at 2025 World Robot Conference**\n\u4f17\u64ce, a Chinese robotics company, unveiled its first heavy-duty, full-size humanoid robot, T800, at the 2025 World Robot Conference in Beijing.

    "summary": "Across a range of experts in manufacturing engineering, robotics, technology market analysis, industrial engineering, and China studies, the consensus is that China has made rapid advances in humanoid robotics, with significant government policy support, state funding, and robust commercial orders. Several companies (e.g., UBTECH, Unitree, Zhiyuan/Yushu, Fourier) are pushing toward large-scale production, and there are notable contracts\u2014often involving hundreds or planned thousands of units. However, strict scrutiny under the question\u2019s criteria (over 1,000 identical, bipedal, fully autonomous, non-teleoperated humanoid robots, credibly reported as produced and delivered by a single company by end of 2025) finds substantial hurdles remaining. \n\nCommonly cited constraining factors include unresolved supply chain and component bottlenecks (especially in actuators, dexterous hands, and reducers), technical limitations in AI autonomy (reliability, motion stability, general-purpose capability), immature manufacturing standardization, and a historical base rate that sees mass production of complex robotics lagging optimistic timelines. While government and competitive pressures increase the likelihood of an aggressive push (possibly even to the point of outcome-claiming for political prestige), most experts doubt widespread deployment or credible public evidence of >1,000 such robots by the deadline.\n\nA few experts, especially those focused on policy acceleration and demonstration effects, see a moderate or even above-even odds possibility that state-backed efforts will force at least one company to announce mass production\u2014though the functional maturity and real-world deployment might lag, or definitions may be stretched in official claims.\n\nFinal probability estimates mostly range from about 13% to 45%, with most clustering in the 18\u201340% range, suggesting a low but non-negligible likelihood. The highest outlier (70%) is specifically grounded in China's past ability to deliver symbolic industrial triumphs in similar settings, but even this scenario acknowledges definitional ambiguity and report credibility risks. The grand median probability among all forecasts is roughly one-third.\n\nIn summary: While China is making remarkable progress and large-scale contracts exist, independent, verifiable evidence of >1,000 identical, fully autonomous humanoid robots produced and delivered by a single company before year-end 2025 is not yet present. Most experts judge the outcome as unlikely, though not impossible, primarily due to technical bottlenecks, late-stage manufacturing challenges, and the high bar set by the resolution criteria.",
