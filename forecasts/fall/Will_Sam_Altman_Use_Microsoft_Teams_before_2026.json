From an IT management/adoption lens, it is highly probable (90%+) that, in the ordinary course of events, Altman has used or will use Teams for at least one major meeting with Microsoft, given multi-billion dollar deals, co-investor calls, and the ingrained usage patterns of enterprise software. However, strict adherence to the resolution criteria (public, credible reporting) drags the probability downward: there is a genuine possibility that even if Altman used Teams, this detail never surfaces before the deadline. The recent precedent (Google Meet firing event) shows that minor details about high-profile meetings can leak and gain traction in the press\u2014particularly during moments of drama or public negotiation between Microsoft and OpenAI. With OpenAI and Microsoft currently embroiled in protracted, contentious, and highly public partnership negotiations, the next 2.5 months feature high odds of another such disclosure. Altman's repeated interviews and press coverage make a confirmed Teams usage plausible, though not inevitable. After weighting the high likelihood of use (from an IT management perspective) against moderate odds of confirmatory reporting, my calibrated forecast is 62%, reflecting mild optimism that public confirmation will emerge, likely in the wake of another headline event or mid-negotiation anecdote about company interactions.",

In a climate this tense, where every symbolic choice matters, Altman and his team may deliberately route around Teams except when there\u2019s no alternative, and both sides can be tight-lipped unless a leak drives a narrative.

Most ongoing exec interactions don't rise to that level of news pizazz, and absent another such bombshell or a deliberate PR maneuver, the reporting threshold remains a real, not theoretical, barrier. You're assuming participants see value in highlighting mundane operational details\u2014whereas, as stakeholders, both have incentives to control what signals get out. Without direct institutional or self-interested leaks, it's perfectly plausible all Teams usage occurs quietly or is redacted in retrospectives in preference for more sensational angles. The historical analogy isn't stale; it's a guardrail against over-extrapolation from outlier events. The base reporting rate on such granular technical choices remains low, even in adversarial settings, unless those choices acquire symbolic value *and* that symbolism is weaponized.

My critique stands: high-profile tech news regularly includes such details when relevant to a story. The recurring point of contention is the discoverability/reporting requirement, but I continue to believe that ongoing tensions and negotiations, leaks, and incentivized press reporting around OpenAI-Microsoft will prompt at least one credible report before the deadline. However, upon further consideration, and weighing the higher confidence reflected by some other experts (notably 'TechIndustryAnalysis' at 85%), I see a modest case to nudge my probability upward: the margin between real usage and credible reporting closes in contentious, media-saturated environments like this one.

The IT management perspective sets a slightly lower estimate (62%) by more conservatively blending use likelihood and reporting odds, but I still believe the combination of elevated media interest, ongoing negotiation drama, and base rates for cross-platform communication supports an elevated probability. I do, however, acknowledge that the requirement for explicit reporting (rather than just plausible usage) is enough of a friction that even my initial forecast may be flirting with overconfidence given no such report has surfaced thus far and the deadline is drawing close.

In the past year, OpenAI has secured major deals with Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Oracle, and SoftBank, collectively forming a global AI infrastructure network. A key agreement with Broadcom involves the joint development and production of a 10GW-scale AI chip, to be manufactured by Taiwan's TSMC and deployed in OpenAI data centers starting in second half 2025. Nvidia committed up to $100 billion and 10GW of computing capacity, while AMD agreed to supply 6GW of GPUs and a warrant allowing OpenAI to purchase 10% of AMD at $0.01 per share. Combined, these partnerships total 26GW of computing power. OpenAI's 'StarGate' project, a $500 billion, four-year AI infrastructure initiative with Oracle and SoftBank, is expanding globally: data center clusters are being built in Abu Dhabi (5GW), Norway (first in Europe), the UK (in partnership with Equinix), and South Korea (with Samsung and SK Group, including construction in Pohang and South Jeolla). Additional projects are underway in Canada. These efforts have brought OpenAI's total AI infrastructure procurement commitments close to $1 trillion. When combined with projected AI infrastructure investments from Big Tech companies\u2014Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta\u2014global AI investment is approaching Altman\u2019s predicted $7 trillion. This surge is driving up stock prices for companies like Nvidia, TSMC, and South Korean memory semiconductor firms. The strategy aims to position OpenAI as a 'hyperscaler'\u2014on par with major tech giants\u2014by leveraging global partnerships and public-private funding to rapidly scale infrastructure. An industry insider noted that OpenAI, as a startup, must attract massive investment and expand its platform to compete with Big Tech.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:51 PM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/11441543)\n\n**OpenAI taps Broadcom to build its first AI processor in latest chip deal By Reuters**\nOpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to design and deploy its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, marking a major step in its strategy to secure computing power amid surging demand for AI services. The custom chips, to be developed and rolled out starting in the second half of 2026, will deliver 10 gigawatts of capacity\u2014equivalent to the electricity needs of over 8 million U.S. households or five times the output of the Hoover Dam. The agreement, which includes deployment completion by the end of 2029, builds on existing co-development and supply ties between the companies. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the partnership 'a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential.' This move follows OpenAI\u2019s recent 6-gigawatt chip deal with AMD and a potential $100 billion investment from Nvidia. The custom chip initiative places OpenAI alongside tech giants like Google and Amazon, which are also developing proprietary AI hardware to reduce reliance on Nvidia\u2019s high-demand, limited-supply processors. While past efforts by Microsoft and Meta have faced delays or performance gaps, analysts believe custom chips won\u2019t challenge Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the short term. Nevertheless, Broadcom has emerged as a major beneficiary of the generative AI boom, with its stock rising nearly sixfold since late 2022. The new systems will be scaled using Broadcom\u2019s Ethernet and networking infrastructure, giving it a competitive edge over rivals like Marvell Technology and challenging Nvidia\u2019s InfiniBand solutions. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, and it remains unclear how OpenAI will fund the project.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 01:18 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openai-taps-broadcom-to-build-its-first-ai-processor-in-latest-chip-deal-4284098)\n\n**The Deal of the Century: Mark Zuckerberg Snatches AI Pioneer Andrew Tolok for $1.5 Billion**\nMeta Platforms Inc. announced the acquisition of Andrew Tolok, co-founder of 'Thinking Machines Lab' under Mirra Morati, in a move signaling CEO Mark Zuckerberg's intensified efforts to strengthen Meta's position in advanced artificial intelligence. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Tolok joined Meta after being offered a compensation package potentially reaching $1.5 billion over at least six years, including performance bonuses and stock incentives. A spokesperson for 'Thinking Machines Lab' confirmed Tolok's departure, citing personal reasons. This hire follows Meta's failed attempt to acquire Morati, prompting Zuckerberg to pursue alternative strategies to recruit top AI talent. Sources indicate Zuckerberg directly contacted more than twelve employees from the startup, including Tolok. The move is part of a broader Meta recruitment campaign targeting leading AI researchers from competitors such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously revealed Meta offered up to $100 million in incentives to lure employees. Industry reactions highlight the unprecedented competition for AI talent, with former Tesla and Nokia engineer Yun-Ta Tsai noting that few professionals are willing to risk personal finances for uncertain success. The deal underscores Meta\u2019s strategic push to close the technological gap and establish leadership in AI innovation, especially amid fierce competition with Google and OpenAI. Meta remains a top performer in growth, momentum, and quality indicators, reflecting strong long-term performance despite short- and medium-term challenges.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 10:15 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/economy/talent/683018)\n\n**In Big Tech's knotty game of AI Twister, what happens when a giant slips?**\nThe AI race among Big Tech giants has intensified competition while simultaneously fostering unprecedented collaboration, creating complex and interdependent relationships. Despite fierce rivalry, companies like OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and Amazon are forming strategic alliances: OpenAI secured a $300 billion deal with Oracle for compute power despite being backed by Microsoft, while Meta signed a $10 billion deal with Google Cloud. Microsoft now offers Anthropic\u2019s AI models, which run on Amazon and Google\u2019s clouds. These partnerships are driven by high stakes and the need to avoid missing the AI revolution, echoing past tech booms. Nvidia\u2019s $100 billion investment in OpenAI includes plans for 10 gigawatts of AI data centers using Nvidia chips, while OpenAI also purchased GPUs from AMD and Oracle, creating a web of cross-dependencies. Nvidia is also helping prop up competitors like Coreweave, which it invested in and later agreed to buy back unsold cloud capacity for $6.3 billion\u2014raising concerns about circular revenue and value destruction. Analysts like Gil Luria and Rishi Jaluria note that while some arrangements are pragmatic and necessary, others\u2014such as Nvidia\u2019s role in seeding and then buying from Coreweave\u2014are seen as unhealthy. Despite risks of overinvestment and financial entanglements, many believe the underlying demand for AI is real and sustainable. The future of this ecosystem hinges on continued customer demand and the ability of leaders like Sam Altman to steer the industry. As Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon noted, 'Sama has the power to crash the global economy for a decade or take us all to the promised land,' highlighting the immense systemic risk and potential at stake.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 08:11 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/big-techs-ai-love-fest-getting-messy-openai-oracle-2025-10)\n\n**Apple\u2019s Former CEO Warns: OpenAI Is Now Apple\u2019s Biggest AI Rival**\nJohn Sculley, former CEO of Apple, stated on October 13, 2025, that OpenAI has become Apple's first genuine competitor in decades, asserting that 'artificial intelligence is not a particular strength of Apple.' According to BUSINESS INSIDER, Apple has lagged in the AI race compared to companies like OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Meta, with its planned major Siri upgrade delayed earlier in the year. With speculation growing about Tim Cook\u2019s potential retirement, Sculley emphasized that Apple\u2019s next leader must transition the company from the app era to the agent era, where intelligent agents autonomously perform complex tasks, disrupting Apple\u2019s current product-centric business model. Sculley believes the agent era will drive a shift toward subscription-based models, offering more sustainable value than selling individual apps and tools. Notably, Apple\u2019s former design chief, Jony Ive, has joined OpenAI after his device startup was acquired by OpenAI for over $6 billion earlier in 2025.

A key agreement with Broadcom involves the joint development and production of a 10GW-scale AI chip, to be manufactured by Taiwan's TSMC and deployed in OpenAI data centers starting in second half 2025. Nvidia committed up to $100 billion and 10GW of computing capacity, while AMD agreed to supply 6GW of GPUs and a warrant allowing OpenAI to purchase 10% of AMD at $0.01 per share. Combined, these partnerships total 26GW of computing power. OpenAI's 'StarGate' project, a $500 billion, four-year AI infrastructure initiative with Oracle and SoftBank, is expanding globally: data center clusters are being built in Abu Dhabi (5GW), Norway (first in Europe), the UK (in partnership with Equinix), and South Korea (with Samsung and SK Group, including construction in Pohang and South Jeolla). Additional projects are underway in Canada. These efforts have brought OpenAI's total AI infrastructure procurement commitments close to $1 trillion. When combined with projected AI infrastructure investments from Big Tech companies\u2014Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta\u2014global AI investment is approaching Altman\u2019s predicted $7 trillion. This surge is driving up stock prices for companies like Nvidia, TSMC, and South Korean memory semiconductor firms. The strategy aims to position OpenAI as a 'hyperscaler'\u2014on par with major tech giants\u2014by leveraging global partnerships and public-private funding to rapidly scale infrastructure. An industry insider noted that OpenAI, as a startup, must attract massive investment and expand its platform to compete with Big Tech.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:51 PM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/11441543)\n\n**OpenAI to Develop AI Chips with Broadcom to Reduce Nvidia Dependence**\nOpenAI announced a strategic partnership with Broadcom to develop its own artificial intelligence (AI) chips, aiming to strengthen its AI infrastructure and reduce dependency on Nvidia. Under the agreement, OpenAI will design custom AI accelerators with a capacity of 10 gigawatts, while Broadcom will develop and begin deploying these chips from the second half of 2026, with full deployment planned by the end of 2029. This move follows OpenAI\u2019s previous agreements with AMD (6 gigawatts) and Nvidia (10 gigawatts), allowing the company to diversify its hardware suppliers, secure supply chains, and increase competition. The 10-gigawatt capacity is equivalent to the energy consumption of over 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity generated by the Hoover Dam. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the collaboration as a 'critical step' in building infrastructure to unlock AI's full potential. The company aims to integrate model development directly with custom hardware to create more powerful, efficient, and specialized AI systems. While financial details were not disclosed, analysts estimate a single gigawatt data center setup costs between $50 and $60 billion. To fund this project, OpenAI may combine support from Microsoft, new funding rounds, pre-orders, and credit options. The broader industry is witnessing a 'custom chip wave,' with Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft also developing their own AI chips to challenge Nvidia\u2019s market dominance. However, experts do not expect a short-term threat to Nvidia\u2019s performance advantage, leaving its response to this competition as a key question.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[Webrazzi](https://webrazzi.com/2025/10/14/openai-broadcom-ile-yapay-zeka-cipleri-uretecek/)\n\n**AI bubble fears grow**\nConcerns are growing that an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble may be forming, as companies tied to AI see their valuations surge. High-profile figures including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have warned that investors are becoming overly excited about AI, leading to inflated stock prices. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, AI has attracted massive investment, with Nvidia becoming the world\u2019s most valuable company, surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization in July 2025 and reaching $4.5 trillion by October 2025. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Meta have also experienced significant growth due to their AI ambitions. Oracle\u2019s stock rose 40% in a single day in September 2025 after announcing multibillion-dollar cloud contracts. James Angel, associate professor at Georgetown University, questioned whether current valuations are justified by future cash flows or driven by investor overexuberance. Altman acknowledged that investors are overexcited about AI, though he affirmed AI\u2019s transformative importance. Bezos echoed this, noting that excessive enthusiasm leads to funding for both strong and weak ideas, making it difficult for investors to distinguish between them. The article highlights the circular nature of AI spending, with companies like Nvidia, OpenAI, and AMD fueling each other\u2019s growth, raising concerns about sustainability. These developments suggest a potential disconnect between market valuations and underlying fundamentals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 09:59 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/newsletters/technology/5553693-ai-bubble-fears-grow/)\n\n**OpenAI and Broadcom team up on $10 billion custom AI chip deal**\nOpenAI and Broadcom have announced a $10 billion partnership to co-develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips and rack-scale computing systems over the next four years.

According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Tolok joined Meta after being offered a compensation package potentially reaching $1.5 billion over at least six years, including performance bonuses and stock incentives. A spokesperson for 'Thinking Machines Lab' confirmed Tolok's departure, citing personal reasons. This hire follows Meta's failed attempt to acquire Morati, prompting Zuckerberg to pursue alternative strategies to recruit top AI talent. Sources indicate Zuckerberg directly contacted more than twelve employees from the startup, including Tolok. The move is part of a broader Meta recruitment campaign targeting leading AI researchers from competitors such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously revealed Meta offered up to $100 million in incentives to lure employees. Industry reactions highlight the unprecedented competition for AI talent, with former Tesla and Nokia engineer Yun-Ta Tsai noting that few professionals are willing to risk personal finances for uncertain success. The deal underscores Meta\u2019s strategic push to close the technological gap and establish leadership in AI innovation, especially amid fierce competition with Google and OpenAI.

Despite fierce rivalry, companies like OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and Amazon are forming strategic alliances: OpenAI secured a $300 billion deal with Oracle for compute power despite being backed by Microsoft, while Meta signed a $10 billion deal with Google Cloud. Microsoft now offers Anthropic\u2019s AI models, which run on Amazon and Google\u2019s clouds. These partnerships are driven by high stakes and the need to avoid missing the AI revolution, echoing past tech booms. Nvidia\u2019s $100 billion investment in OpenAI includes plans for 10 gigawatts of AI data centers using Nvidia chips, while OpenAI also purchased GPUs from AMD and Oracle, creating a web of cross-dependencies. Nvidia is also helping prop up competitors like Coreweave, which it invested in and later agreed to buy back unsold cloud capacity for $6.3 billion\u2014raising concerns about circular revenue and value destruction. Analysts like Gil Luria and Rishi Jaluria note that while some arrangements are pragmatic and necessary, others\u2014such as Nvidia\u2019s role in seeding and then buying from Coreweave\u2014are seen as unhealthy. Despite risks of overinvestment and financial entanglements, many believe the underlying demand for AI is real and sustainable. The future of this ecosystem hinges on continued customer demand and the ability of leaders like Sam Altman to steer the industry.

It explains that the two first met in 2018 and that in 2019 Microsoft invested $1\u202fbillion in Open\u202fAI, acquiring a 49\u202f% stake and securing exclusive rights to run Open\u202fAI\u2019s models on Microsoft Azure.  The deal also obliges Open\u202fAI to use only Microsoft\u2019s cloud infrastructure.  In 2023, when Open\u202fAI\u2019s board unexpectedly fired Altman, Nadella intervened, protecting him and offering to lead a new research team at Microsoft, a move that the article quotes as \u201cEgal, wo Sam ist, er arbeitet mit Microsoft.\u201d  Altman has since pushed for a structural change that would allow Open\u202fAI to go public, proposing to reduce Microsoft\u2019s share of future profits to 10\u202f% by 2030, while Nadella seeks a larger share.  The article also notes Altman\u2019s announcement that Open\u202fAI would join the $500\u202fbillion Stargate infrastructure project.  Parallel to this, the piece outlines Google\u2019s strategy: it invested $400\u202fmillion in Anthropic in February\u202f2023, later adding $2\u202fbillion in October\u202f2023, bringing total investment to $3\u202fbillion and a 14\u202f% stake, with plans for another $750\u202fmillion.  Google\u2019s partnership with Anthropic is framed as a pragmatic response to the threat posed by generative AI to its advertising business.  Finally, the article covers Meta\u2019s aggressive talent\u2011acquisition campaign, claiming that Zuckerberg has lured more than 50 AI researchers from competitors with multi\u2011million\u2011dollar offers, though Meta later halted hiring to consolidate its new team.

In 2019 OpenAI, a nonprofit research lab, created a capped\u2011profit subsidiary and brought in Microsoft, which invested an initial $1\u202fbillion in cash and cloud credits and later added $12\u202fbillion in 2023.  In return, Microsoft received 20\u202f% of OpenAI\u2019s revenue, which had surpassed $10\u202fbillion annually, and a share of profits\u201475\u202f% until the investment was recouped, then 49\u202f% thereafter.\n\nThe partnership\u2019s friction began in November\u202f2023 when OpenAI\u2019s board fired CEO Sam\u202fAltman over alleged reckless pursuit of AGI.  Satya\u202fNadella intervened to reinstate Altman, exposing Microsoft\u2019s heavy reliance on OpenAI.  Microsoft subsequently poached Inflection AI staff in March\u202f2024 and launched its own competing models.\n\nFinancially, OpenAI has been burning cash: losses of $5\u202fbillion in 2024 and no profitability expected before 2029.  Altman raised $6.6\u202fbillion in late\u202f2024, only $750\u202fmillion of which came from Microsoft, and secured a $40\u202fbillion deal in April\u202f2025 (including $30\u202fbillion from SoftBank).  These deals require OpenAI to change its legal status, relinquishing profit distribution to Microsoft and its nonprofit board.\n\nNegotiations stalled when OpenAI offered Microsoft a 33\u202f% stake in a company valued at $100\u202fbillion, but Microsoft prefers to rely on the existing commercial agreement that runs until 2030.  OpenAI has also secured concessions, such as no longer being obligated to use Azure and signing deals with CoreWeave, Oracle, and Google, and plans a $500\u202fbillion data\u2011center project.\n\nThe rivalry now extends to product offerings: both sell access to OpenAI\u2019s APIs, and both provide competing business tools\u2014ChatGPT\u202fPlus (over 20\u202fmillion users) and Microsoft Copilot.  Microsoft also competes in coding assistants via GitHub, while OpenAI plans to acquire Windsurf for $3\u202fbillion but is withholding its technology.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s leverage lies in time: OpenAI must change its legal status before the end of 2026 or risk forfeiting $20\u202fbillion promised by SoftBank and repaying $6.6\u202fbillion raised in 2024.  OpenAI, meanwhile, holds a clause that could cut off Microsoft\u2019s access once AGI is achieved.\n\nKey metrics cited: $1\u202fbillion initial Microsoft investment, $12\u202fbillion in 2023, $10\u202fbillion annual revenue, 20\u202f% revenue share, 75\u202f% profit share until recoup, 49\u202f% thereafter, $5\u202fbillion losses, $6.6\u202fbillion raised, $750\u202fmillion from Microsoft, $40\u202fbillion deal, $30\u202fbillion SoftBank, $500\u202fbillion data\u2011center project, 20\u202fmillion ChatGPT\u202fPlus users.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 10:14 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@jerome_marin/how-openai-and-microsoft-turned-into-frenemies-8918bda814e6)\n\n**Microsoft and OpenAI's AI Alliance on the Brink of Collapse**\nMicrosoft is losing its advantage in AI to its own partner, OpenAI. OpenAI, which received $13.75 billion in investment, is now negotiating from a position of strength to weaken the most profitable relationship in the tech sector. A clause in the contract between the two companies could dynamite the alliance. If OpenAI declares that it has achieved General Artificial Intelligence (AGI), Microsoft would lose access to all future models. This would leave Microsoft anchored in outdated technology while its partner would conquer the market with superior tools. The situation began as a marriage of convenience but has turned into a battle for control. Each company is now trying to reduce its dependence on the other while renegotiating a relationship valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. The AGI clause works like a time bomb in three parts. When the agreement was signed, Microsoft thought AGI would take decades to arrive. However, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been shortening the timeline. The problems started in November 2023, when OpenAI's board fired Altman without warning Microsoft. Although they reinstated him a few days later, Microsoft lost trust in its partner. In March 2024, Microsoft hired Mustafa Suleyman, founder of DeepMind, to lead its internal AI division. OpenAI responded by diversifying its cloud providers with agreements with Oracle and Google. OpenAI's revenue has doubled, from $5.5 billion to $10 billion, in 2024, and is now at $12 billion. However, the company is still losing money, with losses of almost $5 billion in 2024. Microsoft generates $75 billion annually with Azure, and a significant part of it comes from OpenAI. OpenAI wants to restructure its business model to eliminate profit caps and allow investors and employees to have direct participation. Microsoft must approve this change, giving it bargaining power to review the entire relationship. The tensions have escalated beyond financial aspects. Both companies are still deeply interconnected. Negotiations are advancing towards an agreement that could be completed by the end of summer. However, if they fail to reach an agreement, Microsoft could be stuck with the current contract until 2030, risking losing access to the most important AI advancements. OpenAI, on the other hand, needs Microsoft's approval to complete its restructuring and access $40 billion in new funding. The question is whether OpenAI can survive one of the most powerful alliances in technology when both partners have become rivals. The answer will also determine who will control a significant part of the future of AI.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 05, 2025 03:16 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/empresas-y-economia/bomba-relojeria-amenaza-alianza-poderosa-tecnologia-clausula-agi-microsoft-openai)\n\n**Microsoft and OpenAI in Deep Negotiations Over Access to AI Technology**\nMicrosoft is in deep negotiations with OpenAI to secure a new agreement that would allow it to continue using OpenAI's key technology even after the company achieves general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI). The current contract between the two companies would expire if OpenAI reaches AGI, limiting Microsoft's access to the technology. The new agreement aims to eliminate this restriction, which is one of the main obstacles OpenAI faces in its transition to a for-profit company. According to sources, the negotiations are ongoing, and the deal may be reached within a few weeks. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella discussed the matter at the Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, earlier this month. The AGI clause has become a central issue in the negotiations. OpenAI defines AGI as 'a highly autonomous system that surpasses human performance in most economically valuable work.' The current contract includes a separate clause related to the AGI threshold, which can be triggered by technical or commercial milestones. In the technical aspect, OpenAI's board of directors has the authority to determine when the company has reached AGI, and once recognized, Microsoft would lose the right to use the technology developed after that point. The commercial milestone is triggered when OpenAI proves it can generate around $100 billion in total profits for investors, including Microsoft. In this case, Microsoft would lose the right to use all OpenAI technologies, including products developed before the trigger point. If the two parties disagree on the commercial milestone, they may resort to litigation to resolve the issue. The current contract also prohibits Microsoft from developing its own AGI technology, further highlighting the importance of maintaining access to OpenAI's technology for Microsoft. The partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI has been strained in recent times. Microsoft built a supercomputer for OpenAI to develop the ChatGPT language model, in exchange for the right to integrate the technology into its own software products. The event of OpenAI's board firing and rehiring Altman in November 2023 severely impacted Microsoft's confidence in its partner. As the two companies begin to compete for the same customer base - consumers using chatbots and businesses deploying AI assistants to boost efficiency - the competitive relationship has intensified. Despite public statements from executives emphasizing their close relationship, OpenAI has started to seek to reduce its dependence on Microsoft, obtaining permits to build data centers and other AI infrastructure with competitors. Recently, the two parties have also been negotiating Microsoft's stake in OpenAI after the company's restructuring, with the discussed equity ratio ranging from 30% to a low level. Microsoft's stance in the negotiations reflects the complexity of their relationship. In OpenAI's acquisition of the startup io, founded by iPhone designer Jony Ive, Microsoft showed flexibility, agreeing to waive some intellectual property rights. However, in OpenAI's planned acquisition of AI programming startup Windsurf, Microsoft took a harder stance. The deal was cancelled earlier this month, partly due to the tense relationship between the two companies. Windsurf's sales tools compete with Microsoft products, and the company did not want Microsoft to have the right to use its intellectual property. OpenAI was unable to persuade Microsoft to make concessions, and ultimately, Windsurf's co-founders and a few employees agreed to join Alphabet, the parent company of Google, for $2.4 billion. According to sources, if Microsoft believes the equity ratio and other changes to the contract are not sufficient, the company is willing to walk away from the negotiations and stick to the existing contract terms, showing Microsoft's bottom line in the negotiations.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 12:40 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5953466437_162dab04506708vo72.html)\n\n**Sam Altman and Satya Nadella Discuss Possible Future Collaboration**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been in talks with Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, about a possible future collaboration. The two tech giants have been working together since Microsoft became the largest investor in OpenAI, but now they are revising the terms of their investment, including Microsoft's stake in OpenAI. According to the Financial Times, if they don't agree on key issues, Microsoft may pause the negotiations. Altman said, 'We discussed serious things... but everything is fine.' He also mentioned having a 'productive conversation' with Donald Trump about the future of artificial intelligence. Trump has announced a private initiative, Stargate, with a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure, and OpenAI is reportedly involved. While Microsoft and OpenAI are adjusting the details of their partnership, Altman seems to have an international agenda with influential names. With so many tech giants involved, 2026 could be a crucial year to see how the AI landscape is reorganized.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 26, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[FayerWayer](https://www.fayerwayer.com/internet/2025/06/26/sam-altman-podria-asociarse-con-el-ceo-de-microsoft-esto-es-lo-que-se-sabe/)\n\n**Tech Giants Engage in AI Talent War**\nThe tech giants, including Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, are investing billions of dollars to ensure their artificial intelligence (AI) is the most advanced, useful, and popular. To achieve this, they are forming top-notch teams by offering lucrative salaries, 'stealing' top talent from other companies, or paying millions to former employees to return. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, has offered $100 million bonuses to OpenAI employees to join Meta and help the company develop 'superintelligence', a hypothetical AI system that surpasses human capabilities. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, stated that Meta considers OpenAI its biggest competitor and that none of its employees have accepted Zuckerberg's offer. However, Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, has joined Meta after the company acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion. Wang will lead a new AI lab at Meta, focused on developing a general intelligence AI (IAG), a machine that surpasses human intelligence. Zuckerberg has also attempted to acquire Safe Superintelligence for $32 billion, but its creator, Ilya Sutskever, rejected the offer. Meta has instead acquired a stake in NFDG, a venture capital firm co-founded by Daniel Gross, Safe Superintelligence's CEO, and Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO. Altman stated that Meta's efforts to advance AI have not been as successful as expected, leading the company to adopt a more 'aggressive' strategy. OpenAI has also made similar moves, paying $6.5 billion to acquire Jony Ive's company and $650 million to acquire Inflection AI. Microsoft has also acquired Inflection AI and hired Mustafa Suleyman, cofounder of DeepMind. Google has focused on recruiting former employees, including Noam Shazeer, a genius in AI who left the company to start his own business after Google refused to launch a chatbot he developed.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 21, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[elcaribe.com.do](https://www.elcaribe.com.do/gente/tecnologia/las-tecnologicas-en-guerra-por-los-cerebros-de-la-ia/)\n\n**OpenAI CEO Accuses Meta of Trying to Poach Talent with 'Crazy' Offers**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has accused Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg of trying to poach top talent from his company by offering 'crazy' amounts of money, reportedly up to $100 million. Altman said, 'It's crazy - I'm really glad that at least so far none of our best collaborators have decided to accept.' Meta has been making moves to compete in the AI space with OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, including a $60 billion investment in 2025 and a $10 million deal with Scale AI, a company specializing in data labeling for AI model training. Altman also commented, 'There are many things I appreciate about Meta as a company. But I don't think they're a particularly innovative company.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 19, 2025 11:01 AM\nSource:[Il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/06/19/guerra-talenti-ai-altman-zuckerberg-oggi/8032331/)\n\n**Meta's Aggressive Recruitment Strategy Sparks Competition in AI Development**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, accused Meta of trying to weaken his team with $100 million bonuses. The move is part of an intense competition to lead the development of artificial intelligence and 'superintelligence'. According to Altman, Meta considers OpenAI its main competitor in AI development, which explains its aggressive strategy to attract talent. None of OpenAI's key employees have accepted the offer so far, Altman said. However, this move reflects the intense competition between tech giants to lead the AI field. Meta is not only trying to hire OpenAI employees, but has also invested $14.3 billion to acquire 49% of Scale AI, a startup specializing in data for training AI models. Additionally, its CEO, Alexandr Wang, will join Meta to lead a new AI lab focused on developing 'superintelligence', a system that surpasses human brain capabilities. According to reports, Meta has offered multi-million dollar contracts to dozens of researchers from companies like OpenAI and Google, and some have already accepted to join the company. Altman acknowledged that he respects Meta as a company, but questioned its innovation capacity. He said that Meta's AI efforts 'haven't worked as well as they expected', which led them to adopt a more aggressive recruitment strategy. Despite Meta's attempts to attract talent, Altman assured that his team remains committed to OpenAI, at least for now.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 18, 2025 07:59 PM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/tecnologia/2025/06/18/sam-altman-ceo-de-openai-acusa-a-meta-de-querer-debilitar-a-su-equipo-con-bonos-de-100-millones-de-dolares-la-carrera-por-dominar-la-inteligencia-artificial-se-intensifica/)\n\n**Altman Accuses Meta of Trying to Poach OpenAI Talent with $100 Million Bonuses**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has accused Meta of trying to poach his company's talent by offering 'crazy' amounts of money. According to Altman, Meta offered OpenAI employees bonuses of up to $100 million to join their team of generative AI researchers. Altman also stated that Meta offered 'giganteschi' annual salaries, exceeding $100 million, to some of his top collaborators. 'It's crazy. I'm glad that so far none of our best colleagues have decided to accept,' Altman said. Meta has invested billions of dollars in AI technology, competing with OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft in the AI race. Zuckerberg has announced that Meta plans to invest at least $60 billion in AI this year, aiming to become a leader in the field. Meta has also signed a deal with Scale AI, reportedly worth over $10 billion, to acquire their data labeling technology. Altman concluded that while he appreciates some aspects of Meta as a company, he doesn't think they are particularly innovative.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 18, 2025 09:39 AM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/06/18/altman-accusa-meta-100-milioni-di-dollari-per-rubarci-talenti_31c571e7-9dfa-445e-bd74-749e64f8709b.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "The five forecasting experts generally agree that, while it is highly likely that Sam Altman has or will use Microsoft Teams in the ordinary course of business due to the deep, ongoing partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft, the key limiting factor is the requirement for credible public reporting or an official statement to confirm such usage before the end of 2025. Most experts cite strong structural and operational incentives for Altman to use Teams at least once, especially in formal meetings with Microsoft executives or board-level discussions. However, the intense and sometimes adversarial current relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft introduces motivations for Altman to avoid Teams or at least avoid publicizing such use. Historically, executive use of competitors' tools is rarely publicized unless it becomes newsworthy, as in Altman's firing over Google Meet. Thus, the experts' probability estimates range from 30% to 85%, with most clustering around 62%. They expect that unless a significant event or media leak occurs that draws public attention to Altman's platform choice, there is a real chance the required confirmation will not arise, even if Teams was used. Ultimately, the outcome hinges less on actual usage (which is probable) and more on the likelihood of public, credible reporting about that use by the resolution deadline.",
