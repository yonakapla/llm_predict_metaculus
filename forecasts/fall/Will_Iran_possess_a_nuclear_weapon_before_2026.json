Even if Iran had the technical means (HEU stockpile, missile capability), there are no credible signals of the full weaponization sequence: conversion to weapon-grade, core fabrication, weapon integration, and (especially) political decision for overt declaration/testing. With less than 3 months left and absent dramatic, public signals (which would likely be visible and have significant regional impact), the chance that Iran will meet the stringent resolution criteria by December 31, 2025, is very low.

The historical base rate (years-long lag between enrichment and public weaponization), the lack of authoritative reporting, and the strictness of resolution criteria (which require overt or credibly reported acquisition or test, not mere breakout potential) together point solidly against a YES. The only plausible routes to a YES would involve a sudden, risky, and highly escalatory move by Iran against a backdrop of existential threat/total collapse of regime restraint, all within a compressed time window.

The resolution criteria (not just threshold or intent, but confirmed public possession or credible declaration/test) remain the main bottleneck\u2014validated repeatedly by others. Most well-reasoned probabilities are in the 2\u20133% range, and both up- and down-critiques for higher/low-ball estimates reinforce my own analysis that 5% was perhaps slightly high given the recency, severity, and cumulative impact of the 2024 strikes, ongoing sanctions and supervision, and strong regime disincentives for a public move. Incorporating this consensus and the base-rate argument laid out by colleagues, I lower my forecast slightly to 3%.

Deliberators repeatedly highlight the base-rate of historical cases (zero for a sub-three-month jump from HEU stockpile to declared/tested nuclear weapon under maximal surveillance and sabotage), and the discussion further validated that deterrent threats, infrastructural setbacks, and regime preference for ambiguity in deterrence make overt weaponization extremely unlikely before 2026.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nIran\u2019s nuclear program has been a focal point of global attention for decades. Although the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) (JCPOA), signed in 2015, sought to limit Iran's nuclear activities, the United States' withdrawal from the agreement in 2018 and subsequent re-imposition of sanctions escalated tensions. Since then, Iran has [significantly increased](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20ee6qylwgo) its production of highly enriched uranium, despite it officially denying the existence of a nuclear program. In 2022 a [report](https://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/Current_Iranian_Breakout_Estimates_June_1_2022_Final.pdf) by the Institute for Science and International Security claimed that Iran's breakout time - the amount of time needed to produce enough weapons grade material for a nuclear weapon - was basically zero, a claim that was reiterated by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken [in July 2024](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/blinken-nuclear-weapon-breakout-time/index.html).\n\nHowever, estimates of breakout time do not account for the technological capability and time required to build a deliverable nuclear warhead ([which has been estimated by some at 1-2 years](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9870/)). In its [2024 Annual Threat Assessment](https://www.odni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf), the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence concluded that while Iran does not appear to be currently pursuing development of a nuclear device, the nuclear activities undertaken since 2020 \"better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so\".\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

He accused Israel of deceiving the United States into attacking three Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day war in June 2024, and claimed Israel is now attempting to portray Iran's defense capabilities as an imaginary threat. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that Iran is developing intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of 8,000 kilometers, capable of reaching the U.S. East Coast, including cities like New York, Boston, Washington, and Miami. U.S. President Donald Trump responded on Sunday, stating that if Iran attempts to restart its nuclear program, the United States 'will also deal with that,' implying potential military action. Iran possesses a robust missile program with ballistic missiles capable of reaching up to 2,000 kilometers, sufficient to strike Israel, as demonstrated during the June conflict when Tehran launched daily attacks. Araqch\u00ed emphasized that while buildings and machinery can be destroyed, 'our determination will NEVER be broken,' reaffirming that negotiation is the only viable path. Iran and the U.S. had held five rounds of indirect nuclear negotiations, but they stalled after the June war. As a result, the UN reinstated nuclear-related sanctions on Iran in late September 2024, initiated by Germany, the UK, and France\u2014European signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal. That agreement had limited Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, but the U.S. withdrew in 2018, prompting Iran to accelerate its nuclear program, now holding 440 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60%.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:44 PM\nSource:[RPP noticias](https://rpp.pe/mundo/medio-oriente/iran-dice-que-la-solucion-para-su-programa-nuclear-es-negociar-tras-amenazas-de-netanyahu-noticia-1658460)\n\n**Netanyahu Claims Iran Developing Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, Warns of Nuclear Threat**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a Tuesday interview with Ben Shapiro that Iran is developing intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of 8,000 kilometers, which could threaten major U.S. cities including New York, Washington, Boston, Miami, and Mar-a-Lago. He warned of the 'enormous danger' posed by Iran, emphasizing that the regime is 'not necessarily rational' and that it 'chants death to America.' According to Netanyahu, this development represents a significant escalation. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reaffirmed in September 2025 that Iran does not possess nuclear weapons and has no intention of developing them, while noting that Iran has increased uranium enrichment to 60%, a level close to the 90% required for weapons-grade material. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which limited Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, was undermined by the U.S. withdrawal under Donald Trump in 2018. Since then, Iran has resumed enriching uranium beyond the JCPOA limits. While Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes\u2014such as energy, medicine, agriculture, and scientific research\u2014Western nations remain concerned. Israel has conducted sabotage operations, cyberattacks, and assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists since 2010, including at least nine killings reported in June 2025.

According to Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, Iran is currently assessing the 'consequences and implications' of the renewed sanctions. While Iran emphasized that diplomatic contacts and consultations will continue, it reserved the right to act based on national interests when diplomacy is deemed effective. Western nations, led by the United States and supported by Israel, accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons, viewing uranium enrichment as a red line. Iran denies these allegations, asserting its nuclear program is exclusively for civilian use and legally permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirms Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed country enriching uranium to 60%, nearing the 90% threshold needed for weapons-grade material. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), involving the U.S., E3, Russia, and China, had lifted sanctions in exchange for nuclear restrictions. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, reinstating sanctions, prompting Iran to gradually scale back its commitments, particularly on enrichment. Iran has warned that renewed sanctions could lead to suspending cooperation with the IAEA. On October 6, 2025, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that cooperation with the IAEA 'is no longer relevant' under the new sanctions regime, though it remains unclear whether Iran intends to fully terminate its relationship with the agency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[newagebd.net](https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/278258/iran-wont-resume-nuclear-talks-with-europeans-at-this-stage)\n\n**Tehran Has No Plans to Resume Nuclear Talks with Europeans 'at This Stage'**\nIran has stated it has no plans to resume negotiations with European countries regarding its nuclear program 'at this stage,' according to a weekly press conference by Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei. The statement follows the UN Security Council's reimposition of sanctions in late September 2025, triggered by France, the UK, and Germany activating the 'snapback mechanism' under the 2015 nuclear deal, which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from in 2018. Baghaei emphasized that Iran's current focus is on assessing the consequences of actions taken by the three European nations and the United States. He noted that diplomatic communication and consultations will continue, adding that Iran will take decisions 'in the interest of the country and its priorities' whenever diplomacy proves beneficial. The nuclear program has long been a source of tension between Iran and Western powers, particularly the U.S. and Israel, who accuse Iran of seeking nuclear weapons. Iran insists its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, such as electricity generation. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed by Iran and the P5+1 (U.S., China, Russia, France, Germany, UK), limited Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of severe economic sanctions. After the U.S. withdrawal in 2018, Iran gradually reduced its commitments, notably increasing uranium enrichment levels. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed state in the world enriching uranium to 60%, close to the 90% level used for weapons. Iran suspended nuclear talks with the U.S. in June 2025 after Israel launched a large-scale attack targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites. The U.S. intervened in the 12-day conflict by striking three major nuclear facilities in Iran. Iran has warned it may suspend cooperation with the IAEA again if sanctions are reimposed, following a prior suspension after the Israeli strikes. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated on Sunday that cooperation with the UN-affiliated IAEA 'is no longer appropriate' under renewed sanctions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[thenationpress.net](https://thenationpress.net/news-270311.html)\n\n**Nuclear Negotiations on Iran Are Dangerously Stalled Amid Escalating Tensions**\nThe article by Scott Ritter discusses the dangerous stalemate in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, highlighting a deep division among JCPOA participants, with Russia and China opposing a UN resolution to reimpose snapback sanctions. The sanctions, if reinstated, would restrict sensitive nuclear activities (but not uranium enrichment entirely), ban ballistic missile development, block conventional arms imports, allow seizure of Iranian arms shipments, and impose travel bans and asset freezes on specific individuals. Iran has rejected the UN action, calling it illegal, and urged countries to abstain from recognizing it. Iranian officials acknowledged that sanctions harm the Iranian economy and people but argued that the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2024 has unified the country more than at any point since the 1979 revolution, reducing internal fractures and increasing resilience to external pressure. This claim, if true, undermines Western strategies relying on sanctions to force concessions. The article details the history of the JCPOA, noting the U.S. withdrawal in 2018 led to Iran reducing compliance, including enriching uranium to 60%\u2014a level close to weapons-grade, which the U.S. and EU view as unprecedented for a non-nuclear state. Iran claims this enrichment was a response to Israeli attacks on its Natanz facilities and that it is solely a negotiating tool, with a willingness to dilute the uranium to civilian levels in exchange for lifting all sanctions and recognition of its enrichment rights. Iran reaffirms its official stance\u2014through both government and religious leadership\u2014that it will not pursue nuclear weapons. However, relations with the IAEA are now irreparably damaged, with mutual accusations: Iran claims the IAEA leaked information to the U.S. and Israel, used in attacks during the June conflict, while the IAEA alleges Iran is violating its TNP obligations. Access to inspections has been repeatedly restricted and threatened, making monitoring fragile. Iran is believed to still hold enough 60% enriched uranium to produce several nuclear warheads if further enriched. The snapback sanctions have effectively blocked any negotiation window. While Iran is open to diplomacy, its demand to retain enrichment rights is unacceptable to the U.S., Israel, and their allies, increasing the risk of military conflict. Iranian authorities state they are not seeking war but will defend themselves with all available military capabilities, including advanced ballistic missiles capable of challenging U.S. and Israeli missile defenses. The U.S. and Israel retain significant strike capacity but face limitations due to improved Iranian defenses post-conflict.

Araghchi affirmed Iran's commitment to maintaining its uranium enrichment program and stated that Tehran would not enter any nuclear agreement that demands a halt to enrichment. He referenced a prior meeting with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff on May 23, stating, 'Zero nuclear weapons = we have an agreement... Zero enrichment = we don't have an agreement.' Araghchi claimed that if the U.S. reviewed the meeting transcripts, it would recognize how close Iran and the U.S. were to reaching a historic nuclear deal. He warned Washington to learn from the Iraq War, which he said was based on misleading intelligence and caused massive destruction, over 7 trillion dollars in costs, and significant American casualties. Araghchi also criticized U.S. involvement in Israel's 12-day June 2024 strike against Iranian targets, asserting that no intelligence proved Iran was months away from a nuclear bomb\u2014only that Israel misled the U.S. to attack Iran. He argued that Israel now attempts to manufacture a false threat from Iran\u2019s defensive capabilities, while Americans are weary of endless Israeli wars. The UN has reinstated arms embargoes and sanctions on Iran following European-led actions, and the UK, France, and Germany initiated the 'Snapback' mechanism at the UN Security Council, accusing Iran of violating the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Araghchi insisted that only diplomatic negotiation can resolve nuclear issues, stating, 'Buildings and machines may be destroyed, but our resolve will never waver. Persisting in this miscalculation will not solve anything.' According to The Washington Post, U.S. pressure aims to secure four strict conditions: meaningful and direct talks, a halt to uranium enrichment, limits on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and cessation of funding for proxy groups. These conditions were a major obstacle in previous negotiations and are likely deemed non-essential by Tehran. Araghchi stated that these demands were never formally communicated to Iran, and that recent talks have focused solely on the nuclear file, either directly or indirectly with the U.S. He emphasized that Iran\u2019s proposals were clear, and a diplomatic solution would not be unattainable if diplomacy were not restricted. U.S. officials recently reported that the missile issue was raised, with Washington seeking to cap Iranian missile range at 400 km. Netanyahu, in a podcast interview with conservative U.S. media figure Ben Shapiro, claimed Iran\u2019s missiles could reach the U.S. in the future and asserted Israel is effectively protecting America. He said Iran attempted to develop intercontinental nuclear-capable missiles, which Israel, with help from Trump, thwarted. Netanyahu added that Iran\u2019s missiles can reach 8,000 km, and with an additional 3,000 km, they could target New York, Washington, Boston, Miami, and Mar-a-Lago. In July, Iranian lawmaker and IRGC commander Amir Hoveida claimed all European countries are within range of Iranian missiles, noting Iran has developed capabilities over 20 years to target U.S. cities via ships sailing up to 2,000 km from U.S. shores.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 12:37 AM\nSource:[Almaghribtoday](https://www.almaghribtoday.net/451/003706-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%88%D9%87%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A4%D9%83%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%83-%D8%B7%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AC-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A8)\n\n**Araghchi Responds to Trump: Iran and U.S. Were Close to a Historic Nuclear Deal**\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi responded to former U.S. President Donald Trump's recent statements about Iran's nuclear program, asserting that Iran and the United States were close to reaching a historic nuclear agreement before talks collapsed over disputes regarding uranium enrichment. Araghchi emphasized that Iran and the U.S. were nearly at an agreement during their fifth round of negotiations in Rome on May 23, 2024, mediated by Oman, with Araghchi stating in a post on X: 'Nuclear weapon = zero means we have an agreement; uranium enrichment = zero does not mean no agreement.' The U.S. had insisted on zero enrichment capacity, which Iran rejected as violating international agreements, leading to the collapse of talks. The sixth round, scheduled for June 15, 2024, never took place after Israel launched a 12-day military campaign against Iran, followed by U.S. involvement in strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Araghchi claimed that if Israel had not misled the U.S., Iran would have been close to developing a nuclear weapon within one month. He criticized Israel for fabricating a false threat from Iran\u2019s defensive capabilities and accused the U.S. of being exhausted by endless wars on Israel\u2019s behalf. Araghchi stated that while infrastructure may be damaged, Iran\u2019s resolve remains unshaken. He directly addressed Trump, saying, 'Insisting on this miscalculation won\u2019t solve any problem. There is no solution except negotiation.' Trump, in a speech at the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Navy in Virginia on October 6, 2025, threatened to strike Iran again if it resumes its nuclear program, claiming the U.S. had already destroyed all targets with 30 Tomahawk missiles and B-2 bombers, and that Iran is now back at square one. He warned that the U.S. 'won\u2019t wait long' to respond.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 10:42 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/politics/%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AC%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%83%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%8A)\n\n**Iran Says Negotiation Is the Only Solution to Nuclear Program After Netanyahu's Threats**\nIran's Foreign Minister, Ab\u00e1s Araqch\u00ed, stated on X (formerly Twitter) that 'there is no other solution than a negotiated outcome' regarding Iran's nuclear program. He accused Israel of deceiving the United States into attacking three Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day war in June 2024, and claimed Israel is now attempting to portray Iran's defense capabilities as an imaginary threat. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that Iran is developing intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of 8,000 kilometers, capable of reaching the U.S. East Coast, including cities like New York, Boston, Washington, and Miami. U.S. President Donald Trump responded on Sunday, stating that if Iran attempts to restart its nuclear program, the United States 'will also deal with that,' implying potential military action. Iran possesses a robust missile program with ballistic missiles capable of reaching up to 2,000 kilometers, sufficient to strike Israel, as demonstrated during the June conflict when Tehran launched daily attacks. Araqch\u00ed emphasized that while buildings and machinery can be destroyed, 'our determination will NEVER be broken,' reaffirming that negotiation is the only viable path. Iran and the U.S. had held five rounds of indirect nuclear negotiations, but they stalled after the June war. As a result, the UN reinstated nuclear-related sanctions on Iran in late September 2024, initiated by Germany, the UK, and France\u2014European signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal. That agreement had limited Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, but the U.S. withdrew in 2018, prompting Iran to accelerate its nuclear program, now holding 440 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60%.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:44 PM\nSource:[RPP noticias](https://rpp.pe/mundo/medio-oriente/iran-dice-que-la-solucion-para-su-programa-nuclear-es-negociar-tras-amenazas-de-netanyahu-noticia-1658460)\n\n**Iran Says It 'Expects' World to Ignore U.N. Nuclear Sanctions**\nThe Iranian Foreign Ministry stated on October 7, 2025, during a press briefing that it 'expects' all United Nations member states to ignore the reimposition of U.N. nuclear sanctions against Iran, which were triggered by France, the United Kingdom, and Germany after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found Iran in breach of international nuclear law in June 2025. The snapback mechanism, activated under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was approved by the U.N. Security Council on September 29, 2025, despite opposition from China and Russia. China condemned the move as 'not constructive' and warned it would disrupt diplomatic efforts, while Russia declared it would 'not recognize the snapback as coming into force,' asserting a 'parallel reality' where the sanctions do not apply. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei echoed this stance, calling the sanctions 'irresponsible and destructive' and vowing to use all available tools to protect national interests. He claimed Iran has 'no plans for negotiations' with the European JCPOA countries and condemned Turkey's compliance, labeling it 'illegal' and 'unnecessary.' The reimposed sanctions, as outlined by the European Union, include bans on arms exports, technology related to enrichment and ballistic missiles, asset freezes on Iran's Central Bank, and restrictions on Iranian cargo flights. The EU also reported that Turkey has applied sanctions affecting 20 Iranian individuals and 18 entities linked to nuclear fuel production, uranium enrichment, shipping, and energy. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi dismissed the sanctions as weakening European influence, arguing they have diminished the EU\u2019s negotiating leverage. The IAEA\u2019s Director-General Rafael Grossi had previously testified that Iran was obstructing inspections, sanitizing uranium enrichment sites, and failing to provide credible responses to Agency inquiries, undermining verification efforts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:04 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/10/06/iran-says-it-expects-world-to-ignore-u-n-nuclear-sanctions/)\n\n**Iran declares nuclear deal \"defunct\" amid rising tensions with West   - NaturalNews.com**\nOn October 5, 2025, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared the Cairo agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 'defunct,' citing European 'snapback' sanctions and U.S.-backed Israeli military strikes as key reasons for the breakdown in diplomacy. The agreement, signed on September 9, had temporarily restored cooperation after Iran suspended inspections in response to Israeli airstrikes in June. However, the European Union\u2019s decision to reinstate sanctions on September 28\u2014backed by the U.S.\u2014effectively nullified the deal. Araghchi stated that Iran remains open to negotiations, but only if Western nations act in good faith and cease coercive measures. Iran has recalled its ambassadors from Germany, France, and Italy, accusing the EU of hypocrisy for enforcing sanctions while claiming to support the 2015 JCPOA, which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from in 2018. The diplomatic collapse follows Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June\u2014condemned by Tehran as 'grave war crimes'\u2014and subsequent U.S. involvement using bunker-buster bombs. Araghchi accused the U.S. of negotiating in bad faith, alleging American officials knew of Israel\u2019s planned strikes while still engaging in talks. He emphasized that Iran has exhausted all diplomatic avenues to prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear program, citing a 2007 U.S. intelligence assessment that Iran halted nuclear weapons development in 2002. Despite the setback, Araghchi reiterated Iran\u2019s commitment to IAEA oversight and warned that future negotiations may exclude European powers. The UN Security Council\u2019s rejection of a resolution to lift sanctions\u2014opposed by nine members, including the U.S.\u2014further strained relations. With Israel threatening renewed attacks and Iran vowing a 'harsher response,' analysts warn of a potential wider conflict, especially if Russia finalizes a defense pact with Iran, which would dramatically reshape regional alliances. The collapse of the Cairo agreement marks another failure in the decade-long diplomatic effort to resolve Iran\u2019s nuclear dispute, with trust severely eroded and the risk of escalation high.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 01:03 PM\nSource:[NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-10-07-iran-declares-nuclear-deal-defunct-tensions-with-west.html)\n\n**Netanyahu Claims Iran Developing Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, Warns of Nuclear Threat**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a Tuesday interview with Ben Shapiro that Iran is developing intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of 8,000 kilometers, which could threaten major U.S. cities including New York, Washington, Boston, Miami, and Mar-a-Lago. He warned of the 'enormous danger' posed by Iran, emphasizing that the regime is 'not necessarily rational' and that it 'chants death to America.' According to Netanyahu, this development represents a significant escalation. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reaffirmed in September 2025 that Iran does not possess nuclear weapons and has no intention of developing them, while noting that Iran has increased uranium enrichment to 60%, a level close to the 90% required for weapons-grade material. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which limited Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, was undermined by the U.S. withdrawal under Donald Trump in 2018. Since then, Iran has resumed enriching uranium beyond the JCPOA limits. While Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes\u2014such as energy, medicine, agriculture, and scientific research\u2014Western nations remain concerned. Israel has conducted sabotage operations, cyberattacks, and assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists since 2010, including at least nine killings reported in June 2025.

Speaking at a U.S. Navy event in Virginia, Trump emphasized that the U.S. would not wait long before acting if Iran resumes uranium enrichment, following joint U.S.-Israeli airstrikes in June 2025 that targeted key Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. Trump claimed these strikes 'obliterated' much of Iran's nuclear capability, asserting Iran had been 'within a month' of producing a nuclear weapon before the attacks. He affirmed that another round of bombing would be 'sure, without question, absolutely' if needed, though he believes Iran cannot 'go back into nuclear anytime soon.' In response, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared Iran's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 'no longer relevant,' accusing Western nations of violating agreements and citing the reimposition of U.S. sanctions as removing incentives for negotiations. He criticized the UK, Germany, and France for attempting to use 'snapback' sanctions, saying their efforts have diminished their influence. Intelligence reports indicate growing military activity in the Persian Gulf: the U.S. has deployed additional aircraft, including refueling planes, to a base in Qatar, while Russian military flights to Iran have increased, reportedly delivering weapons. Regional analysts warn that escalating tensions could rapidly involve Israel, which participated in the June strikes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 12:31 AM\nSource:[Worthy Christian News](https://www.worthynews.com/109241-trump-warns-iran-against-renewing-nuclear-program-says-u-s-will-take-care-of-it-if-necessary)\n\n**Iran won\u2019t resume nuclear talks with Europeans \u2018at this stage\u2019**\nIran has stated it has no plans to resume nuclear talks with European nations\u2014Britain, France, and Germany (the E3)\u2014at this stage, following their reimposition of sanctions on September 28, 2025, which triggered the UN's snapback mechanism. According to Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, Iran is currently assessing the 'consequences and implications' of the renewed sanctions. While Iran emphasized that diplomatic contacts and consultations will continue, it reserved the right to act based on national interests when diplomacy is deemed effective. Western nations, led by the United States and supported by Israel, accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons, viewing uranium enrichment as a red line. Iran denies these allegations, asserting its nuclear program is exclusively for civilian use and legally permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirms Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed country enriching uranium to 60%, nearing the 90% threshold needed for weapons-grade material. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), involving the U.S., E3, Russia, and China, had lifted sanctions in exchange for nuclear restrictions. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, reinstating sanctions, prompting Iran to gradually scale back its commitments, particularly on enrichment. Iran has warned that renewed sanctions could lead to suspending cooperation with the IAEA.

The statement follows the UN Security Council's reimposition of sanctions in late September 2025, triggered by France, the UK, and Germany activating the 'snapback mechanism' under the 2015 nuclear deal, which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from in 2018. Baghaei emphasized that Iran's current focus is on assessing the consequences of actions taken by the three European nations and the United States. He noted that diplomatic communication and consultations will continue, adding that Iran will take decisions 'in the interest of the country and its priorities' whenever diplomacy proves beneficial. The nuclear program has long been a source of tension between Iran and Western powers, particularly the U.S. and Israel, who accuse Iran of seeking nuclear weapons. Iran insists its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, such as electricity generation. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed by Iran and the P5+1 (U.S., China, Russia, France, Germany, UK), limited Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of severe economic sanctions. After the U.S. withdrawal in 2018, Iran gradually reduced its commitments, notably increasing uranium enrichment levels. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed state in the world enriching uranium to 60%, close to the 90% level used for weapons. Iran suspended nuclear talks with the U.S. in June 2025 after Israel launched a large-scale attack targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites. The U.S. intervened in the 12-day conflict by striking three major nuclear facilities in Iran. Iran has warned it may suspend cooperation with the IAEA again if sanctions are reimposed, following a prior suspension after the Israeli strikes.

The sanctions, if reinstated, would restrict sensitive nuclear activities (but not uranium enrichment entirely), ban ballistic missile development, block conventional arms imports, allow seizure of Iranian arms shipments, and impose travel bans and asset freezes on specific individuals. Iran has rejected the UN action, calling it illegal, and urged countries to abstain from recognizing it. Iranian officials acknowledged that sanctions harm the Iranian economy and people but argued that the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2024 has unified the country more than at any point since the 1979 revolution, reducing internal fractures and increasing resilience to external pressure.

The Natanz enrichment plant was hit, with about 15,000 centrifuges reportedly destroyed; the Fordow site was \u2018obliterated\u2019 by U.S. forces; and the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center was badly damaged by Israeli aircraft. The strikes also led to the assassination of more than ten Iranian nuclear scientists. Despite these losses, the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) says Iran still retains residual capabilities that could allow it to rebuild its nuclear program. Iran enriched uranium to 60\u202fpercent\u2014well above the 3.67\u202fpercent limit of the 2015 JCPOA\u2014producing 440.9\u202fkg of enriched material before the June\u202f13 Israel\u2011Iran war. The United Nations sanctions that were lifted under the JCPOA were re\u2011imposed on September\u202f27\u202f2025 by Germany, France and Britain under the \u2018snapback\u2019 mechanism, imposing financial restrictions, bans on enrichment and reprocessing, an arms embargo and limits on ballistic\u2011missile tests. A resolution sponsored by China and Russia to delay the sanctions for six months only received the support of four of the 15 Security Council members. Iran has rejected the sanctions as \u2018legally baseless and unjustifiable\u2019 and has suggested withdrawing from the Non\u2011Proliferation Treaty. Israel praised the sanctions as a \u2018major development\u2019 and said it would use \u2018every tool\u2019 to prevent a nuclear\u2011armed Iran. The article notes that Iran has not been a nuclear threshold state since the June war, but the INSS calculates that Iran could abandon its program, negotiate a new pact, gradually restore threshold status or covertly break out toward a weapon. President Masoud\u202fPezeshkian has said at the UN General Assembly that Iran will \u2018never seek to build a nuclear bomb\u2019, a claim that remains unverified.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 08:49 PM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/iran-may-try-to-rebuild-its-nuclear-program/)\n\n**Editorial: The Resurgence of Iran Sanctions and the Middle East Nuclear Domino Concerns**\nThe editorial argues that the United Nations Security Council\u2019s re\u2011imposition of sanctions on Iran after roughly ten years of suspension marks a critical moment in the Middle East\u2019s nuclear security. It explains that the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was a bargain between Iran and the P5+1 (U.S., U.K., France, Russia, China, and Germany) that would have lifted sanctions in exchange for limiting Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment to fuel\u2011grade levels. The first Trump administration withdrew unilaterally in 2018, re\u2011imposing sanctions and prompting Iran to raise enrichment levels. In June 2024 Israel and the United States carried out air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, after Iran halted IAEA inspections. The European Union then moved to reactivate sanctions, which now ban weapons exports to Iran and freeze the assets of nuclear\u2011related officials, with all UN member states required to enforce them. The piece warns that without enrichment limits Iran could secretly advance a nuclear weapon, potentially triggering a \u201cnuclear domino\u201d in the Gulf as Saudi Arabia and other adversarial states might pursue their own arsenals. It notes that such a scenario would undermine the NPT, which currently permits only the five P5+1 states to possess nuclear weapons. The editorial cites the UN Secretary\u2011General\u2019s repeated calls for continued diplomatic engagement and the U.S. Secretary of State\u2019s appeal for talks, stressing that if nuclear development is confirmed the U.S. and Israel would be prepared to retaliate.

A final UN Security Council vote is scheduled for later Friday on a resolution that would extend the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) for six months until 18\u202fApril\u202f2026, while the current JCPOA expires on 18\u202fOctober.  Sources say the Russian\u2011Chinese draft will fail to secure the required nine\u2011country majority in the Council, meaning the Council will have to activate the \u2018trigger mechanism\u2019 to re\u2011impose sanctions, which are expected to take effect by midnight Saturday\u2011Sunday GMT.  The JCPOA originally lifted sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities; the United States withdrew unilaterally in 2018 and re\u2011imposed sanctions, after which Iran gradually withdrew from many of its commitments.  High\u2011level talks have intensified at the UN General Assembly, notably a meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron and Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, in an attempt to reach a new agreement.  German, French and British diplomats have left New\u202fYork, claiming they have \"done everything possible\" to move the process forward, but the European side says the only way to avoid a return to sanctions is a surprise breakthrough.  Macron told a press conference that \"there is still a possibility of an agreement\" but that only a few hours remain.  Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas demanded full IAEA access to Iran\u2019s core nuclear facilities and the resumption of talks, especially with Washington, and the adoption of a safeguard mechanism for enriched uranium.  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Iran \"must never possess a nuclear weapon\" and that diplomatic solutions are \"extremely unlikely\".  The article quotes the Iranian president saying \"Iran has never sought and will never seek to produce a nuclear weapon\" and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declaring that Iran will \"not surrender\" to Western pressure.  Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for the elimination of Iran\u2019s enriched uranium stockpile and the re\u2011imposition of sanctions, while the United States has demanded the abandonment of enrichment.  The JCPOA capped enrichment at 3.67\u202f% and Iran had increased its enrichment to 60\u202f% after withdrawing from parts of the deal.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 03:48 PM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**Iran\u2019s IAEA Inspection Resumption: Nuclear Facility Concerns and Limits of Sanctions**\nThe New\u202fYork\u202fTimes article, dated\u202f27\u202fAugust\u202f2025, reports that Iran has agreed to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect the Bushehr nuclear power plant but has refused inspections of three uranium\u2011enrichment sites.  The United Kingdom, France and Germany have warned that if Iran does not comply, they will re\u2011impose broad sanctions before the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) expires on\u202f18\u202fOctober\u202f2025.  Israel and the United States claim that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is a weapons threat, a view that has intensified since the 12\u2011day war in June\u202f2024.  The IAEA has continued negotiations with Iran and has inspected Bushehr, a development that could restart monitoring of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.  Iran maintains that its programme is for peaceful purposes, yet it stores about\u202f400\u202fkm of highly enriched uranium, a quantity that the IAEA says is not required for civilian use.  IAEA Director\u2011General Gholi has stated that Iran is obliged to allow inspections of the three facilities bombed by the United States, though technical discussions continue; if the sites have collapsed, Iran is not required to excavate them, but the agency claims it has equipment capable of detecting nuclear material even without full access.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[WEDGE Infinity(\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30b8)](https://wedge.ismedia.jp/articles/-/38915)\n\n**Tehran Approves Resumption of Cooperation with IAEA**\nTehran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) announced that its nuclear committee approved earlier signed agreements to resume cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Resuming inspections could help Iran avoid new economic sanctions imposed by Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, China and Russia. In 2015 the three European states and the US, China and Russia signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In 2018 the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew and imposed sanctions. Since then Tehran has gradually abandoned its obligations and resumed uranium enrichment, reportedly exceeding the JCPOA limit fourfold, a claim Iran denies. Cooperation with the IAEA was suspended after a 12\u2011day war in June\u202f2025 when Israel and the US struck Iranian nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. IAEA inspectors were expelled on 2\u202fJuly by President Masoud Peshgheian. In June\u202f2025 Israel launched a massive attack on Iran, supported by the US, targeting mainly nuclear and military sites; Iran responded with missile and drone strikes. Rafael Grossi has repeatedly urged Tehran to allow inspections of the three damaged sites to assess damage and enriched uranium stockpiles, but the Iranian government has repeatedly refused.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/iran-odobril-soglasenie-o-vozobnovlenii-sotrudnicestva-s-magate/a-73989436)\n\n**Is the Agreement to Prevent an Iranian Nuclear Weapon Finally at Risk? A Step**\nOn 28 August 2025, Germany, France and the United Kingdom activated the UN Security Council\u2019s 'snapback mechanism' to reinstate sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme. The three countries sent a letter to the Council threatening to reactivate sanctions that had been lifted between 2006 and 2010 and to terminate the 2015 'Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action' (JCPOA). The snapback requires the Council to decide within 30 days whether to continue the sanctions lift; if no resolution is adopted or it is vetoed by a permanent member, the earlier sanctions automatically re\u2011enter. The article notes that Russia, which cooperates with Iran, may support a resolution, while Britain and France could veto. It also reports that Iran, with a population of about 90\u202fmillion, is already heavily hit by US sanctions and that re\u2011activated UN measures would target its economy and military. The piece cites that Iran had produced more than 400\u202fkg of 60\u202f% enriched uranium before the Israeli\u2011US attacks on its nuclear sites, and that the IAEA chief Rafael Grossi has said Iran is the only state producing near\u2011weapon\u2011grade material. The article concludes that the EU\u2019s move signals the end of its patience after Iran continued violations of the JCPOA and that the snapback could lead to a hardening of Iran\u2019s stance and potential escalation.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 10:01 PM\nSource:[ad-hoc-news.de](https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/ausland/steht-das-abkommen-zur-verhinderung-einer-iranischen-atombombe-endgueltig/68152958)\n\n**UK, France and Germany to Reimpose Sanctions on Iran Over Nuclear Program**\nThe United Kingdom, France and Germany announced on Thursday that they intend to restore the stringent sanctions regime against Iran that had been suspended after the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The three European states, which were co\u2011signatories of the deal along with the United States, the EU, China and Russia, say Tehran has been violating its commitments since 2019, exceeding limits on enriched uranium, heavy water and centrifuges, and restricting IAEA inspections. By invoking the JCPOA\u2019s automatic response mechanism, they have opened a 30\u2011day negotiation window before sanctions are re\u2011imposed. They are demanding that Iran resume talks with Washington, allow unrestricted IAEA access to its facilities, and reduce its stock of about 400\u202fkg of highly enriched uranium \u2013 enough to build up to ten nuclear weapons \u2013 in exchange for a six\u2011month extension of the suspension. The article notes that the JCPOA remains in force until 18\u202fOctober\u202f2025, after which all previous sanctions would lapse unless the pre\u2011warning period is activated. It also recounts that Iran claims its uranium production is for civilian purposes and threatens to withdraw from the Non\u2011Proliferation Treaty if sanctions are reinstated. The piece cites the European foreign ministers\u2019 statement that they will keep seeking a diplomatic solution, and quotes Iranian Foreign Minister Kazem\u202fGaribabadi saying Iran remains committed to a mutually beneficial solution. The article concludes that the UK, France and Germany will trigger the automatic mechanism in late August so that any reinstatement of sanctions occurs before Russia\u2019s rotating presidency of the UN Security Council, preventing veto\u2011driven delays.\n\nKey metrics: 400\u202fkg of highly enriched uranium, 10 potential nuclear weapons, 30\u2011day negotiation period, 6\u2011month suspension extension, JCPOA expiry on 18\u202fOctober\u202f2025.\n\nQuoted statements (single quotes):\n- 'Desde 2019, Ir\u00e1n ha sobrepasado los l\u00edmites [de producci\u00f3n] de uranio enriquecido que establec\u00eda el JCPOA, de agua pesada y de centrifugadores.'\n- 'La combinaci\u00f3n de esos pasos por parte de Ir\u00e1n, junto con una pr\u00f3rroga limitada [de la suspensi\u00f3n de las sanciones] habr\u00edan proporcionado una ruta cre\u00edble para alcanzar un nuevo acuerdo pol\u00edtico que reemplazara al vigente...'\n- 'Ir\u00e1n sigue comprometido con la b\u00fasqueda de una soluci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica que beneficie mutuamente a las partes', ha dicho el ministro de Exteriores, Kazem Garibabadi.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 03:57 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-08-28/el-reino-unido-francia-y-alemania-anuncian-que-reimpondran-sanciones-contra-iran-por-su-programa-nuclear.html)\n\n**UK, France and Germany to revive sanctions on Iran over its nuclear...**\nOn 28\u202fAugust\u202f2025 the United Kingdom, France and Germany announced plans to re\u2011impose United Nations\u2011backed sanctions on Iran, citing concerns that Tehran is developing nuclear weapons. The three European powers, known as the E3, will reactivate sanctions that were suspended when the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed. They have written to U.S. Secretary of State Marco\u202fRubio and notified the UN, and a 30\u2011day window has been set before the sanctions take effect, during which the E3 hopes to restart diplomatic talks and persuade Iran to curb its nuclear ambitions. The UK government said the move is driven by three factors: Iran is in 'significant non\u2011compliance' with the JCPOA; Iran is the 'only non\u2011nuclear\u2011weapon state producing highly\u2011enriched uranium', with a stockpile of over 400\u202fkg \u2013 the amount needed to build a bomb; and there has been 'no sufficient response on the Iranian side to reach an agreement' about scaling back its program, despite the E3 'making every effort to resolve this diplomatically, bending over backwards to do so'. The sanctions are expected to provoke a harsh reaction from Tehran, especially after Israel\u2019s 12\u2011day war earlier this year, during which Israeli forces targeted Iran\u2019s largest nuclear sites. IAEA inspectors have returned to Iran after the conflict but face movement restrictions. The E3 also said a six\u2011month extension to delay sanctions 'still remains' as a possibility.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 02:04 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-15043551/UK-France-Germany-revive-sanctions-Iran-nuclear-programme.html)\n\n**Escalation Threatens: Iran Warns European States After Nuclear Talks**\nAccording to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran now possesses a multiple of the enriched uranium that was stipulated in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). After the June bombings of Iranian nuclear facilities, Tehran resumed talks with European governments, but the negotiations ended without a breakthrough. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghai said on state television that the parties discussed their positions in Geneva, but no progress was made, and a political escalation over Iran\u2019s nuclear program now looms. Vice\u2011Foreign Minister Kasem Gharibabadi urged the so\u2011called E3 states\u2014Germany, France, and the United Kingdom\u2014and the UN Security Council to make the 'richtige Entscheidung' and to 'der Diplomatie Zeit und Raum geben', as he wrote on X. The ministry\u2019s spokesman Esmail Bakaei earlier affirmed Tehran\u2019s willingness to avert looming sanctions, saying 'Unser Fokus liegt darauf, Handlungen oder Vorf\u00e4lle zu verhindern, die dem Land teuer zu stehen kommen k\u00f6nnten', and that the Iranian leadership is negotiating 'mit aller Kraft'. The E3 states, which are co\u2011signatories of the 2015 JCPOA, warned they could trigger the snap\u2011back mechanism to re\u2011impose earlier sanctions. The United States withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, after which Iran gradually abandoned its commitments and increased uranium enrichment. The European states and the UN have not yet re\u2011imposed the 2015 sanctions and have been attempting to negotiate a new agreement, but these efforts have so far been unsuccessful. The June 12\u2011day war between Israel and Iran ended with a ceasefire on 24 June, after which Iran denied accusations of pursuing a nuclear weapon and reiterated that its enrichment activities are for civilian purposes.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 07:46 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Iran-warnt-europaeische-Staaten-nach-Atomgespraechen-article25989847.html)\n\n**The Fiction of a Clear Countdown to the Iranian Bomb**\nThe notion that Iran is 'five years' away from a nuclear bomb has been a repeated phrase in Western geopolitics for over three decades. However, despite numerous predictions, the country has yet to cross the nuclear threshold. The real issue is not what we know about Iran's nuclear program, but rather the vast amount of uncertainty surrounding it. This uncertainty has led to dangerous decisions, including Israel's war against Iran, which was sparked by Netanyahu's claim that the regime is 'on the verge of completing a nuclear bomb.' The US initially denied direct involvement in the attack, but has since provided political and military support. A message from former President Donald Trump, 'IRAN CANNOT HAVE A NUCLEAR ARMS!', has been used as a blank check for Israel. Despite 30 years of unfulfilled predictions, the 'imminent nuclear bomb' in Iran is not a new concept, but rather a political construct that has been gestating for decades, with Netanyahu as its primary architect. The CIA's 2007 National Intelligence Estimate concluded with 'high confidence' that Iran had halted its nuclear militarization program, the Plan Amad. The verification of this pause came in 2015 with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that limited Iran's uranium enrichment to 3.67% in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The US withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, driven by the same rhetoric of an 'imminent bomb,' triggered Iran's response, which has accelerated the current crisis. Despite this, there is no evidence beyond the expansion of enrichment plants that Iran has the necessary technology or is developing nuclear arms. The difference between enrichment and nuclear arms is a crucial distinction. Enriching uranium is the visible part of the process, increasing the concentration of the fissile isotope 235 from 0.7% natural to 90% (the armament grade). Iran has accumulated a large amount of uranium enriched to 60% since the US withdrawal from the JCPOA. However, having the fuel is not the same as having the 'weaponization,' a set of incredibly complex steps to convert the fissile material into a functional warhead. Iran's resiliency in the face of sanctions, sabotage, assassinations, and cyberattacks has made its nuclear program stronger and more autonomous. The country designs and produces its own advanced centrifuges and has developed the largest and most diverse ballistic missile program in the Middle East. This institutionalized knowledge in the regime has led Israel to eliminate key figures in the nuclear program and launch missile sites. The cycle of violence and rhetoric has accelerated the conviction in Tehran that a nuclear bomb is the only guarantee of survival. Iran's case is a hybrid of the survival logic of North Korea and the strategic ambitions of Pakistan. It shares the logic of survival with North Korea, but also has the strategic ambitions of Pakistan. This dual nature makes diplomacy complex and the 'red line' difficult to decipher. The narrative of a clear countdown to the Iranian bomb is a dangerous fiction. It fixes our attention on a single measurable metric, uranium enrichment, but it is unclear whether Iran has the necessary technology to develop nuclear arms. What seems to have accelerated things is that, now, if the Iranian regime survives, an Israeli attack can only push it towards a more determined nuclear program.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 17, 2025 05:01 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/energia/llevamos-decadas-creyendo-que-iran-esta-a-cinco-anos-bomba-nuclear-realidad-solo-sabemos-cuanto-uranio-enriquece)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasts converge on a very low probability that Iran will possess a nuclear weapon before 2026, with predicted probabilities clustering tightly between 2% and 8%. Almost every expert\u2014whether approaching from technical nonproliferation, intelligence, security policy, political science, or regional studies\u2014emphasizes that while Iran retains the technical knowledge and enough 60% enriched uranium for a bomb, actual weaponization (building, testing, and credibly announcing a usable device) remains a significant technical and political leap. The June 2024 US-Israeli military strikes are uniformly cited as a major setback, having destroyed critical enrichment capacity and delayed any potential breakout. Additional deterrents include the threat of overwhelming Israeli/US retaliation, intense surveillance, ongoing sabotage, and the high bar set by the question\u2019s resolution criteria, which requires overt declaration, a credible test, or acknowledgment by recognized arms control organizations.\n\nAll experts identify that: (1) the time remaining before 2026 is too short for technical recovery and full weaponization in the wake of recent sabotage; (2) Iran\u2019s political leadership continues to publicly reject nuclear weapons\u2014reinforced by religious doctrine and regime survival logic; (3) the resolution criteria exclude mere enrichment or covert advances; and (4) the historical base rate for states crossing from threshold capability to overt nuclear possession, especially under this level of scrutiny and threat, is near zero. A few experts allow for a very small chance of a 'black swan' event (such as regime desperation or an uncontrolled escalation triggering previously hidden weaponization), but even the highest probability estimate (8%) is low. In sum: the consensus across all disciplinary perspectives is that the likelihood Iran will possess\u2014by global authoritative recognition\u2014a nuclear weapon before 2026 is extremely low, largely precluded by technical, political, and military constraints within the tight remaining timeframe.",
