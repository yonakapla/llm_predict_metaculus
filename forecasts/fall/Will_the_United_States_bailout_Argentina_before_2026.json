However, direct, bilateral U.S.-to-Argentina government bailouts remain rare historically, and domestic opposition (especially given the election cycle) introduces real risk of delay or walk-back. The key variable is whether Argentina\u2019s financial/currency collapse before year-end will force utilization of already announced but unused tools (swap line drawn, disbursed loan, or bond purchase). Given the technical activation requirements of swap lines in crisis and the ongoing rapid drain on Argentina\u2019s reserves, it is more likely than not (though far from certain) that at least a partial drawdown or emergency disbursement will occur before 2026\u2014even if only in token volume as a political signal, to avoid immediate default or a much larger cataclysm.

The evidence as of October 1, 2025, points to repeated public announcements and pledges, but no confirmed execution of swap line drawdowns or direct cash transfers. The Trump administration has a greater-than-usual willingness for unconventional international financial support, especially for ideologically aligned regimes, and the ongoing Argentine crisis is genuinely acute. However, political cost for unilateral action is rising (explicit bipartisan opposition, farm lobby, legislative oversight), and the US administration itself has at times 'downplayed' prospects ('I don't think they need a bailout\u2026 we'll help them in some way'). The most likely short-term path is pre-electoral signaling to stabilize markets until the Argentine midterms, with implementation risk for a true US bailout after the elections if the crisis deepens. As of forecast date, there is high headline probability but moderate actualization risk. Given the fine print ('opens a dollar swap line AND the BCRA draws from it\u2026'), and barring new, confirmable evidence in the next several weeks, I assess the probability of a formal US bailout\u2014direct transfer, drawn swap line, or bond purchase\u2014occurring before 2026 as higher than the long-term historical base rate but still below even odds, reflecting the extraordinary (but perhaps not yet completely unprecedented) nature of the present support.",

Multiple reputable news sources and official US statements corroborate that concrete bailout proposals are under active consideration, with both swap lines and direct credit discussed. However, strong domestic backlash (from both parties), angry farmers, Congressional opposition, and concerns about the precedent and mechanism (i.e., bypassing Congress) are significant barriers. There is, at the same time, an unusually high degree of alignment between the US Executive branch and Milei ideologically, and a strong historic bias on the part of US foreign policy elites to shore up market-leaning partners in Latin America. With Argentina\u2019s situation worsening and the extent of public commitment by the US now greater than usual, my estimation is that\u2014while not a lock\u2014the odds are considerably above baseline (~15-20% for random large developing country in crisis), but not near-certainty due to high political risks and unresolved procedural details.

However, your estimated probability of 40% appears somewhat conservative when contextualizing the unique current alignment of diplomacy, financial urgency, and explicit and continuous high-level US signaling, which collectively increase the likelihood that at least a technical action (even a small swap draw) will materialize before year's end. The Trump administration\u2019s pattern of ideologically motivated, sometimes unconventional interventions lowers the relevance of historical precedent alone, and the threshold for YES resolution is relatively low\u2014any swap line draw, even minimal. Markets anticipate some formal action beyond hollow signaling, especially if post-election market crises escalate. Thus, recent actions and the political optics of 'standing by' Milei make a minimal technical disbursement more probable than your estimate suggests. In the context of bilateral negotiation dynamics, a face-saving, nominal intervention could satisfy both sides and trigger a 'yes' even in the face of domestic resistance."

While Realist logic does support bold action to stabilize a potential ally and hemispheric order, your 80% probability arguably underestimates persistent operational barriers in US financial decision-making\u2014especially the concrete procedural and reputational risks in deploying ESF resources or establishing/drawing on a Fed swap line with a high-default-risk borrower. The historical record includes rhetorical support that never translates into action, particularly absent acute systemic contagion risk. Partisan and bipartisan resistance, legal doubts, and the tradition of using the IMF as a shield for such interventions remain real constraints, not easily overridden by realism alone. While the ideological affinity and presidential-level commitment are extraordinary, there is a material risk that support will remain rhetorical, at least until events force a visible market panic post-election. The fine-print threshold (actual disbursement or swap draw) is not trivial, and your probability may overstate the ability of the administration to both overcome resistance and operationalize support in the remaining window."

The base rate for last-minute reversals or symbolic support\u2014especially when facing bipartisan opposition, angry farm lobbies, and heightened sensitivity around the misuse of the Exchange Stabilization Fund\u2014remains consequential. The technical requirements for a swap line draw or a direct Treasury transfer are not mere formalities: cross-institutional frictions (not least between Treasury, the Fed, and political appointees), as well as political calculations regarding the optics of 'bailing out' Argentina pre-US election, create plausible pathways where all the lining-up signals still fail to yield a qualifying action before New Year's Eve. Furthermore, Trump's own vacillation ('we're gonna help...I don't think they need a bailout') hints at ongoing caution, especially if market turmoil does not reach acute levels post-election. History is littered with robust US commitments to Latin American allies that stall at the final step when domestic or institutional interests push back. Thus, even with low barriers for YES as defined in the resolution, a near-certainty forecast in the 90s does not appropriately reflect these layers of operational, political, and procedural friction."

From a Realist lens, I concur that base rates for actual intervention are notably higher when clear US national and strategic interests are involved, especially with an ideologically aligned regime at risk and regional influence at stake. Furthermore, you appropriately recognize the tendency for US financial support to tip from words to action when crisis severity peaks, particularly in the presence of symbolic political value and public commitments. The blend of technical flexibility, strategic imperative, and high-stakes diplomatic signaling makes your probability well-calibrated to the likely interplay of power and interest\u2014particularly as 'minimal intervention' is enough for a YES.

You rightly highlight the base rate shift when stated US support is this explicit\u2014particularly with pre-existing institutional tools like swap lines or Treasury facilities\u2014and the unique motivation for action prior to pivotal elections. However, you prudently remain below an 'extreme' probability, reflecting the importance of institutional friction, partisan optics, and historical precedent of US support stalling at the final step.

By anchoring your forecast in historically rare direct US bailouts but then explicitly noting the shift induced by present-day Trump-Milei ideological alignment, acute market pressure, and the unusually public nature of current US Treasury signaling, you avoid both the trap of over-relying on historical precedent and the temptation to chase headline risk. You also correctly identify the main practical barrier as execution risk and domestic opposition, rather than mere stated intent. The reasoning that even a minor swap line draw or emergency loan qualifies under the broad resolution criteria is especially salient from a debt crisis theory perspective, which often focuses on threshold effects and non-linear triggers for policy intervention. Thus, your final 70% is well justified and shows appropriate humility: it is bold given the context but does not push to unwarranted certainty, and recognizes that US crisis response is frequently reactive, not preemptive."

You accurately identify that the base rate for a US-Argentina bailout markedly increases once public commitments are made via established frameworks such as swap lines, and that both institutional inertia and bureaucratic tools like the ESF enable action even in the face of domestic resistance. Your argument for a high probability reflects a nuanced understanding that, despite Congressional and farm lobby pushback, such opposition has rarely stopped the US Treasury or Federal Reserve from limited, technical interventions if the strategic stakes are deemed sufficient and the action can be justified as a stabilization measure. The recognition that the resolution bar is low (any transfer, loan, swap draw, or bond purchase) and that US institutional practice often moves from signaling to technical execution in pressured moments aligns with both the past record and the likely near-future pathway. This approach thoughtfully integrates both the power of public advance signaling and the pragmatic reality of Washington decision-making during international financial crises."

The explicitness and density of both bilateral bargaining and public signaling, combined with a unique ideational narrative of \"saving\" a free-market experiment, makes it less likely the current US administration would allow things to stall entirely. Moreover, the low bar for resolution (any swap draw, loan, or token transfer) means even small, technically-oriented disbursements\u2014often executed via backdoor, semi-obscure procedural pathways\u2014are more probable than not once the US executive is committed. Still, I agree that my 93% probability could overshoot the degree of caution warranted by historical walk-backs, and that a slightly lower, yet still bold, forecast (e.g., mid-to-high 80s) would more judiciously account for the possibility of end-stage failure to deliver in time."

The consensus, especially from those with IR and IPE perspectives, is that the bar for resolution is meaningfully low\u2014any actual draw or minor disbursement counts\u2014and the US administration has set mechanisms in motion making at least a token bailout far more likely than standard precedent. Critically, the distinctive combination of escalating Argentine distress, heightened political/ideological motivation in the White House, and explicit, repeated commitment signals make a technical (even symbolic) bailout before year-end highly plausible. The critique of the more conservative forecast (SovereignDebtAdvisory) highlighted that high-level US-Argentina negotiation dynamics create strong incentives for action, even amid opposition. The only significant retarding factors are US domestic backlash and the risk of delay if markets stabilize post-elections, but these appear outweighed by the convergence of ideological, diplomatic, and technical motivations and the established infrastructure for a swap. On balance, this supports a bolder, more confident forecast. I am therefore increasing my probability to reflect both the explicit low bar for YES and the weight of group expertise.",

However, some more process-oriented and sovereign-debt experts remain meaningfully below 50%, primarily because of the historical base rate and the persistent, meaningful domestic and institutional friction to actual execution. I am persuaded that my original estimate, positioned between these groups, adequately reflected both the unusually elevated probability due to political intent and market pressure, AND the real-world frictions that could still derail action even at the last moment. My critique of the most bullish forecast (DependencyTheory, 93%) highlighted ongoing, nontrivial barriers\u2014especially for an overt US bailout in an election year. I also appreciate group observations (e.g., DiplomacyBilateralnegotiationpractice) that even a token or technical swap draw could satisfy the criteria, suggesting firmness above 60% is justified.

These may plausibly delay or even block activation of a qualifying US bailout action before year-end, especially if market crisis does not visibly deepen post-election.

Helpful critiques offered caution on both sides: lower-probability forecasters (e.g., SovereignDebtAdvisory) questioned whether execution risk and domestic political friction could prevent a qualifying US action, while high-end forecasters (DependencyTheory) perhaps underestimated these hurdles. What stands out is strong consensus that a technical YES is highly probable unless late-stage political, operational, or institutional pushback blocks even a modest intervention. The best arguments for caution emphasized the risk of a last-minute walk-back in the face of domestic backlash and the incomplete handoff from intent to action in prior crises. However, the bar for YES is lower than for a typical full-blown bailout\u2014any swap draw, even small or symbolic, suffices\u2014and the repeated, bipartisan history of actual interventions (albeit often more indirectly) during acute market duress makes it likelier than not that the US will operationalize at least a token support. As an institutionalist, I also give weight to the design of the current US channels, which lower the barriers for execution without new Congressional appropriations. The higher forecasts in the group, especially from other IR perspectives, confirm my sense of unusually forward institutional momentum.

However, critiques from Debt Crisis and Sovereign Debt perspectives persuasively argue that significant operational, legal, and domestic barriers still exist, especially absent acute post-election financial or political panic in Argentina. There\u2019s also a credible risk that the currently announced US support remains symbolic or conditional through the end of 2025, particularly with both bipartisan opposition and ambiguous signaling from Trump himself ('I don't think they need a bailout').

Repeatedly receiving IMF loans, the crisis culminated at the [turn of the millennium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%932002_Argentine_great_depression) and resulted in a majority of the population living below the poverty line. Following the crisis, Argentina underwent [debt restructuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring) and economic reforms, however economic problems persisted and by 2023 inflation had once again [surpassed 100%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-64960385).\n\nIn the [2023 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Argentine_general_election), [Javier Milei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei) was elected President of Argentina. Milei campaign on a platform of [radical economic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei_2023_presidential_campaign) and free market policies, including dollarizing the economy, abolishing the Central Bank, and privatizing state-owned enterprises. Following the election, Milei faced political pressure and challenges and moderated his proposals, however significant economic reforms were still implemented.\n\nDuring Milei's tenure, Argentina's economy has continued to face significant challenges. Although poverty has dropped from its peak, many have lost access to basic needs programs, and although inflation declined following an initial spike, it remains far above normal levels.&#x20;\n\nPrior to Milei's presidency, Argentina had implemented significant currency controls, resulting in a split between the formal and informal rate of the Argentine Peso. Milei initially attempted to unify the exchange rate with a \u201ccrawling peg\u201d system before eventually allowing the peso to [float freely](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/04/12/argentina-to-lift-strict-currency-controls-on-monday_6740130_4.html).

This would allow Argentina to exchange pesos for U.S dollars with the U.S central bank, giving it the ability to defend the peso\u2019s exchange rate and receive short term funding. Following this, Trump [downplayed the plans](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250923-we-re-gonna-help-trump-to-the-rescue-of-struggling-argentina) saying \"I don't think they need a bailout\" but touted unspecified \"help\" to Argentina.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40031,\"question_id\":39572}}`",

The next day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced close coordination with Milei and pledged a 'large' financial intervention to stabilize Argentina\u2019s economy, including a potential $20 billion credit line, bond purchases, and central bank currency swaps. This support came amid a severe economic crisis: Argentina\u2019s peso fell 6% in a single day on October 1, 2025, its largest drop since September 8, forcing the government to sell $1 billion in foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. The central bank had already spent $1 billion by September 19 to keep the peso within its exchange-rate band, which limits daily fluctuations against the dollar. Milei, a far-right libertarian elected in November 2023, had implemented austerity measures\u2014cutting subsidies, slashing public payrolls, and reducing ministries\u2014leading inflation to drop from 211% to 37% in a year. However, economic activity stalled, unemployment rose, and public approval fell from 48% in July to 41% in mid-September. Political setbacks included a provincial election loss, a corruption scandal involving his sister, and Congress overturning his vetoes on health and education funding. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) launched its 23rd program in April 2024, underpinning the peso\u2019s floating exchange rate. Despite Bessent\u2019s announcement, the peso dropped again by 6% on October 1, closing at 1,380 per dollar. Analysts, including Andres Abadia of Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that U.S. support has strengthened Argentina\u2019s international reserves and eased default risk, but described the aid as a 'bridge to the election' rather than a long-term solution. The intervention is expected to delay a peso devaluation until after the October 26 mid-term elections, when Milei seeks to strengthen his Libertad Levanza Party\u2019s position in Congress. Experts warn that if Milei performs poorly, inflation risks will rise and financial instability could return. Bessent\u2019s pledge marks the second major U.S.-backed bailout for Argentina under Trump, following a $50 billion IMF deal for Mauricio Macri in 2018. According to Abadia, the aid is a 'lifeline, but not a panacea,' and the underlying economic and political challenges remain unresolved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/1/can-trump-save-argentinas-crisis-stricken-economy-as-he-hopes)\n\n**The U.S. Should Not Bail Out Argentina**\nArgentina is facing another financial crisis, having borrowed $20 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2024 with promises of reform, though the IMF's chief endorsed President Javier Milei's party without ensuring the implementation of his unstable economic plans. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the Trump administration was prepared to 'do what is needed' to support Argentina ahead of its October 2024 legislative elections, sparking bipartisan backlash. The move is controversial because U.S. soybean farmers face their worst financial outlook in decades after China shifted soybean purchases from the U.S. to Argentina, especially following a tax holiday in Argentina that boosted imports. Milei\u2019s radical austerity measures\u2014symbolized by a chainsaw gift to Elon Musk\u2014failed to resolve Argentina\u2019s deep economic issues, including a 33% poverty rate and a projected recession. His overvalued peso benefits the wealthy but harms exports, while Chinese imports surged 80% in the first half of 2024. Despite his ideological alignment with Trump, Milei\u2019s popularity is declining, with his party facing low poll numbers. A U.S. bailout via the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) would be unprecedented and unjustified, as Argentina\u2019s financial problems do not threaten U.S. dollar stability. Such a bailout would primarily benefit hedge funds and speculators who bet on Milei\u2019s failed reforms, inflating asset values without fostering long-term growth. The Treasury\u2019s use of the ESF for political or ideological reasons would bypass congressional oversight and risk public trust, especially after past overreach during the 2008 crisis. U.S. farmers, already suffering from inflation, worker shortages, and retaliatory tariffs, are protesting the bailout, with small-farm bankruptcies at a five-year high. Even some Republicans, like Senator Chuck Grassley, oppose the move. While Argentina produces critical minerals like lithium, the Treasury is not justifying intervention on that basis. The article argues the U.S. should reject the bailout, instead focusing on aiding struggling American farmers and consumers, reforming the misuse of the ESF, and pursuing strategic economic partnerships in Latin America through trade, development finance, and supply chain investments\u2014not bailouts for politically connected leaders. The IMF is also criticized for promoting austerity that benefits global investors over local populations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:51 AM\nSource:[Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/01/the-u-s-should-not-bail-out-argentina/)\n\n**Milei\u2019s Dollar Crisis: A Fragile Economy on the Brink of Collapse**\nArgentina's economy under President Javier Milei is facing a severe dollar shortage, with nearly $18 billion in dollar purchases since mid-April 2024 following the relaxation of the 'cepo' (currency controls) for individuals. Despite a $14 billion disbursement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a $20 billion agreement\u2014only five months after the initial bailout\u2014reserves continue to decline. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, issued three supportive posts on X (formerly Twitter) to stabilize confidence, but these have not attracted sufficient foreign investment. The upcoming meeting between Milei and Donald Trump on October 14, 2025, just before U.S. midterm elections, is seen as a political gesture rather than a financial commitment. The Central Bank of Argentina, led by Santiago Bausili, has taken emergency measures, including banning banks from acting as intermediaries for dollar transactions via digital wallets (Ual\u00e1, Mercado Pago) and brokerage firms (Cocos), citing regulatory authority. These actions reflect desperation amid accelerating dollar demand and dwindling reserves. The government\u2019s economic strategy, led by Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank President Bausili, has failed to build a dollar buffer ahead of the October 26 election. Despite transferring $1.5 billion in agricultural export gains to agribusinesses, the Treasury only retained $2.5 billion of $7 billion in declared foreign sales, with the rest absorbed by speculative demand. As a result, bond yields have fallen and the risk premium rose to 1,230 points. The IMF is expected to demand structural reforms and devaluation post-election. The article argues that Milei\u2019s government lacks political anchoring, with its economic model relying on unsustainable financial speculation and external support. Without a credible political foundation, the government\u2019s stability\u2014and the viability of its economic program\u2014remains in question.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:45 AM\nSource:[El Destape](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/economia/donald-trump/milei-baila-en-la-cornisa-cambiaria-20251010552)\n\n**Argentina's Milei Grapples with Turmoil Ahead of Crucial Parliamentary Elections**\nJavier Milei, the libertarian president of Argentina, is facing growing political turbulence ahead of the October 26, 2025 parliamentary elections. Despite a significant drop in poverty\u2014from 52.9% in early 2024 to 31.6% a year later, according to Argentina\u2019s National Institute of Statistics (Indec)\u2014and a sharp decline in inflation\u2014from 211% in 2023 to 117.8% in 2024, with the monthly rate falling to 1.9% in August 2025, his popularity has declined from 55% approval in July to 58% disapproval in September, according to a Universidad de San Andr\u00e9s survey. Milei\u2019s party, La Libertad Avanza, suffered a major setback in the Buenos Aires provincial elections, losing by 14 points to the Peronist opposition, a strategic blow just one month before the national vote. His economic reforms, which include slashing public spending, eliminating export taxes on agricultural products, and securing a potential $20 billion swap agreement with the U.S. Treasury, are under strain due to a 17% depreciation of the peso over three months and a $1 billion loss in central bank reserves. The government has also faced a credibility crisis after audio recordings revealed a suspected bribery scheme involving Karina Milei, the president\u2019s sister and secretary general of the presidency, at the National Disability Agency. Milei has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated. Despite these challenges, Milei continues to promote his vision of economic freedom, declaring on X: 'Vive la libert\u00e9, bordel!' and asserting that 'the worst is behind us.' However, analysts like Ignacio Labaqui warn that if the campaign is led by the same figures responsible for the provincial defeat, the government could face serious legislative obstacles. With $28 billion in debt due by mid-2026 and foreign direct investment down 90% in Q1 2025 to just over \u20ac500 million, the sustainability of Milei\u2019s 'liberal revolution' remains uncertain.

Canada and the United States lead the regional ranking, followed by Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica\u2014three Latin American countries that combine political stability with economic openness, representing the exception that confirms the rule of fragile institutional quality in the region. At the bottom are Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti, trapped in authoritarianism and institutional collapse. The rest of Latin America shows uneven progress: Peru and Panama occupy mid-tier positions, while Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina\u2014despite their size and influence\u2014face persistent issues such as weak justice systems, unstable economic rules, and political power eroding checks and balances. Brazil is undergoing a significant institutional moment, with former President Jair Bolsonaro recently sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison for conspiracy against democratic order, making him the third former Brazilian president to be convicted by the judiciary\u2014a development highlighting the functioning of legal mechanisms in a democracy. Argentina is seen as a country in transition: under President Javier Milei, the economy has seen inflation drop from 200% to around 40%, fiscal balance restored, and growth near 5%. However, the ICI data still reflect conditions prior to Milei\u2019s reforms. The Buenos Aires provincial elections served as a political thermometer: La Libertad Avanza won 34% of the vote, compared to 47% for Peronism\u2014a surprising defeat that triggered a market reaction: a two-digit stock market drop, a surge in country risk, and the peso pushed to the edge of its exchange rate band. However, following Milei\u2019s U.S. visit and endorsements from the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Donald Trump, markets rebounded: bonds and stocks rose, country risk declined sharply, and the dollar fell further, aided by a $7 billion tax relief package implemented in three days. These market signals tempered the initial electoral shock and provided political breathing room ahead of October\u2019s crucial congressional elections. More than economic performance, the Buenos Aires vote appeared to penalize the government\u2019s credibility, particularly due to corruption allegations involving Milei\u2019s sister and chief advisor, Karina Milei, and a perceived tepid presidential response\u2014contrasting with Milei\u2019s promise to 'cleanse the elite.' October\u2019s elections, which will renew half the Congress, are decisive: Milei needs to expand his parliamentary base to advance deep reforms in fiscal, labor, and pension policy. The ICI\u2019s central lesson is clear: prosperity does not come by decree or rhetoric, but through rules that limit power, protect property, enforce contracts, and promote economic freedom\u2014exemplified by Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico now face the opportunity\u2014and test\u2014of following that path, while Nicaragua and Venezuela serve as warnings of what happens when institutions are abandoned. For liberalism, this is a moment of both opportunity and challenge: Argentina must transform its current economic momentum into real institutional strengthening capable of resisting the cycle of hope and disappointment that plagues much of Latin America.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/america-latina-frente-al-espejo-de-sus-instituciones-nid01102025/)\n\n**Milei Government Sells Dollars Amid Argentine Peso Decline After U.S. Financial Rescue Ambiguity**\nThe Argentine peso faced renewed pressure, falling over 6% intraday on September 30, 2025\u2014the largest single-day drop since September 8\u2014prompting the government of President Javier Milei to intervene by selling dollars in the spot market. By 13:50 Buenos Aires time, the peso had declined 1.3% for the day, though the exact volume sold was not disclosed, as the Central Bank declined to comment and the Ministry of Economy did not respond to inquiries. This marked a sharp reversal from a previous rally of over 10% following U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s announcement of a $20 billion financial rescue package. Despite earlier gains fueled by a temporary tax reduction on exports that generated $7 billion in revenue and the re-imposition of some capital controls, the peso\u2019s decline resumed due to uncertainty over Milei\u2019s political stability ahead of the October 26 midterm elections and ambiguity about the future of his exchange rate policy. The lack of clarity on the U.S. bailout\u2019s terms continued to weigh on assets. Argentine dollar-denominated bonds maturing in 2035 dropped more than 1.3 cents to 54 cents on the dollar, among the worst performances in emerging markets. BBVA strategist Alejandro Cuadrado noted that while the U.S. gesture calmed markets, it did not resolve underlying imbalances or reverse the peso\u2019s medium-term upward trend. Milei, in his first public appearance since Bessent\u2019s announcement, stated that Argentina would maintain its swap agreement with China while negotiating a financial rescue with Washington, confirmed that financing is secured through the end of next year, and announced planned cabinet changes after the October 26 elections.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 10:33 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/bloomberg/bc-gobierno-de-milei-sale-a-vender-dolares-tras-nueva-baja-en-peso-argentino.phtml)\n\n**Argentina's Milei Grapples with Turmoil Ahead of Crucial Parliamentary Elections**\nJavier Milei, the libertarian president of Argentina, is facing growing political turbulence ahead of the October 26, 2025 parliamentary elections.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Milei cut subsidies, regulations and public payrolls, producing a fiscal surplus (excluding interest) and stopping the Central Bank from financing deficits. The first results show monthly inflation fell from 12.8\u202f% in December, when Milei was elected, to 1.9\u202f% in August. However, Argentina remains tied to a rigid exchange regime that keeps the peso artificially stable at the cost of foreign reserves and competitiveness. The WSJ warned: 'No es gratis, no es un regalo. Es deuda y Argentina tendr\u00e1 que pagarla', highlighting that Mexico faced a similar crisis in 1994. Economists say the real problem is structural: inequality, poverty, lack of decent jobs, health and education crises, and dependence on primary sectors. The peso collapsed after the official party\u2019s electoral defeat, forcing the Central Bank to spend billions to maintain parity. Milei promised 'dolarizaci\u00f3n' but lacks the political and financial space to implement it. Former IMF chief Gita Gopinath recommends devaluation and a floating currency, but the president fears the political cost. Price controls have temporarily curbed inflation, but rising internal costs have hurt competitiveness and spiked imports. The WSJ argues a lasting solution requires a more flexible currency and a stronger export sector. Argentina still has high protectionism and heavy tax burdens that limit industry. Although Milei suspended some export taxes, the US is pressuring to reactivate them as part of the rescue conditions. The Trump administration could negotiate a trade deal with Argentina, opening new markets and reducing China\u2019s influence, but such support would depend on deep structural reforms and fiscal discipline. Beyond economic aid, analysts note the rescue is part of the global contest for leadership in Latin America.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 12:45 AM\nSource:[Periodico Correo](https://periodicocorreo.com.mx/internacional/2025/sep/25/milei-recibe-20-mil-mdd-de-eu-el-rescate-no-alcanza-para-frenar-la-crisis-en-argentina-139033.html)\n\n**Milei\u2019s Chainsaw Falls: Argentina\u2019s \u2018Miracle\u2019 Economy Threatened to End in Nightmare**\nThe article chronicles the rise and fall of President Javier\u202fMilei\u2019s so\u2011called \"economic miracle\" in Argentina.  Milei\u2019s shock\u2011therapy\u2014dropping the exchange\u2011rate peg, tightening fiscal policy, cutting state financing and launching a \"cultural war\" against the \"casta\"\u2014initially lowered inflation from 20\u202f% monthly in January 2024 to below 5\u202f% in June and pushed the risk\u2011country spread from 2,500 points in 2023 to about 500 points in January\u202f2025.  However, the over\u2011valued peso and the need for dollar inflows created a crisis when the government removed the currency controls in April\u202f2025.  The Central Bank raised bank reserve requirements to 53\u202f% and paid interest in pesos of almost 80\u202f% to curb the dollar, which led to a sharp contraction in economic activity.  The Centro de Econom\u00eda Pol\u00edtica Argentina (Cepa) reported a real current\u2011account surplus of 49.8\u202f% and an additional financing cost of roughly US\u202f100\u202fmillion for firms.  The Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos (Indec) showed that GDP grew 6\u202f% YoY in Q2\u202f2025 but fell 0.1\u202f% from Q1, while consumption dropped 1.1\u202f%.  The article cites Marina\u202fDal\u202fPoggetto, director of EcoGo, who notes that Milei secured US\u202f22\u202fbillion from a fiscal moratorium and another US\u202f20\u202fbillion from the IMF, yet never re\u2011accessed international credit.  It also quotes sociologist Ariel\u202fWilkis: 'El milagro de Milei fue hacer un ajuste con apoyo popular.'  The piece highlights the political fallout: Milei\u2019s approval slipped to just under 50\u202f% after raising utilities and cutting public pensions, and he lost the Buenos\u202fAires legislative race by about 14\u202fpercentage points.  Credit\u2011card delinquency rose from 1.9\u202f% in June to 4.4\u202f% in July, and personal\u2011loan delinquency climbed from 4.1\u202f% to 6.4\u202f%.  The article concludes that the economic slowdown, high inflation, and political defeats threaten Milei\u2019s agenda, while foreign investors remain wary, citing the need for a stable macro\u2011environment and reforms that cannot be enacted by decree.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/negocios/2025-09-20/la-motosierra-de-milei-se-cala-el-milagro-economico-de-argentina-amenaza-con-acabar-en-pesadilla.html)\n\n**Argentina\u2019s Milei Government Intervenes in Currency Market, Selling $53\u202fMillion to Stabilize Peso**\nThe Argentine government, under President Javier\u202fMilei, intervened in the foreign\u2011exchange market on 17\u202fApril\u202f2025, selling US$\u202f53\u202fmillion (\u2248R$\u202f280\u202fmillion) from the Central Bank\u2019s reserves to curb the peso\u2019s rapid depreciation.  This was the first such intervention since the country adopted a floating exchange regime in April\u202f2024.  After the sale, the Central Bank\u2019s dollar reserves fell by US$\u202f98\u202fmillion, leaving a balance of US$\u202f3.977\u202fbillion.  The move followed a sharp rise in the wholesale dollar rate to 1.474\u202f50 pesos, the upper limit of the currency band, and a retail rate of 1.485\u202fpesos, with some private banks reporting 1.490\u202fpesos.  The intervention was authorised under the IMF\u2011approved rule that allows the Central Bank to sell reserves when the wholesale rate exceeds the band\u2019s ceiling, which was set at 1.474\u202f40 pesos the day before.  \n\nMilei\u2019s administration has struggled to build confidence and attract foreign investment despite cutting inflation from over 200\u202f% to a lower level.  The government\u2019s liberal policy of ending the \u201ccepo\u201d (a cap on dollar purchases) in April led to a freer but weaker peso, increasing demand for dollars and pressuring the currency.  According to Carlos\u202fHenrique, director of operations at Frente\u202fCorretora, the intervention is a \u201ccrisis containment\u201d and a \u201cdrastic change\u201d from Milei\u2019s previously liberal stance: \n\n'The government had been trying to reduce volatility with higher interest rates and banking restrictions, but the pressure on the peso made direct intervention inevitable, reflecting problems that had been building up since before the current political crisis and the inability to resolve the fiscal crisis,' he said.\n\nThe article also notes political turmoil, including a corruption scandal involving the president\u2019s sister Karina\u202fMilei and a poor showing for Milei\u2019s party in the September\u202f7 provincial elections, where the party received 33.7\u202f% of the vote compared with 47.3\u202f% for the Peronists.  These events are portrayed as contributing to the peso\u2019s weakness and the need for intervention.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 01:51 PM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2025/09/18/argentina-intervencao-cambio-53-milhoes-dolar.ghtml)\n\n**How Is Milei Performing in Argentina?**\nIn November\u202f2023, a group of more than 100 economists, including Thomas\u202fPiketty, sent an open letter warning that if Javier\u202fMilei implemented his radical proposals the Argentine economy would collapse.  The article argues that this \u2018devastation\u2019 did not occur because Milei never fully carried out the promised reforms.  Instead, he adopted more conventional policies, mainly deep austerity, which the piece describes as \u2018feroce e molto traumatiche\u2019 but not radically different from those proposed by centre\u2011right candidate Patricia\u202fBullrich or recommended by the IMF.\n\nMilei\u2019s administration has been criticised for weakening democracy, threatening press freedom and dismantling institutions that defend human rights and minorities.  Economically, the article highlights that inflation \u2013 which was about 140\u202f% annually when Milei took office, after hovering near 300\u202f% \u2013 fell to 36.6\u202f% in July\u202f2024.  This decline was achieved by turning a fiscal deficit into a surplus through a harsh austerity campaign that froze wages and pensions, laid off more than 30\u202f000 public employees, halted many infrastructure projects and cut subsidies for the poorest.\n\nThe article quotes Milei saying the peso was \u2018meno di un escremento\u2019 and explains that the government raised interest rates, required banks to hold more reserves and sold dollar reserves to support the peso\u2019s value.  It notes that the peso\u2019s appreciation has helped curb inflation but also made imports cheaper and exports more expensive, potentially harming domestic industry.\n\nSocial indicators are mixed: poverty fell from 41.7\u202f% in December\u202f2023 to 34.7\u202f% in May\u202f2025 after the inflationary shock, yet the austerity cuts have harmed the most vulnerable.  The article reports a 20\u202fbillion\u2011dollar IMF loan and a 6.1\u202f% GDP growth in Q1\u202f2025, but warns that inflation remains far above the 2\u202f% target and that the peso\u2011support strategy is increasingly problematic.\n\nThe piece concludes that Milei\u2019s reforms may be stalling and that his lack of parliamentary majority limits his ability to push further liberalisation.  It frames the situation as a potential experiment that could either recover or fail, drawing parallels with past Argentine presidents.\n\nKey metrics cited: inflation 140\u202f% \u2192 36.6\u202f%; poverty 41.7\u202f% \u2192 53\u202f% \u2192 34.7\u202f%; IMF loan ~20\u202fbillion\u202fUSD; GDP growth 6.1\u202f% Q1\u202f2025.\n\nQuotes used: 'meno di un escremento', 'dato eccellente', 'inflazione 140\u202f% circa', 'pesa ha un valore abbastanza alto', 'inflazione 36,6\u202f%'.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 08:14 AM\nSource:[Il Post](https://www.ilpost.it/2025/09/14/milei-argentina-economia/)\n\n**A Vote Sparks a Triple Blow for Argentina\u2019s Economy**\nArgentina\u2019s ruling coalition suffered a decisive defeat in the Buenos Aires provincial election, with the Peronist candidate winning 47.3% against Mil\u00e9\u2019s 33.7%, a margin of roughly 13 percentage points that exceeds market and poll expectations. This loss signals that Mil\u00e9\u2019s camp will face greater challenges in the October 26 national mid\u2011term elections, heightening concerns about the government\u2019s ability to continue its economic reform agenda.\n\nThe market reacted sharply: the peso fell 5.6% intraday, closed 3.1% lower at 1,407 per dollar, setting a new historical low. The benchmark stock index (.MERV) dropped 13%, while the U.S.\u2011listed Argentine index (.BKAR) plunged 18%. The 2030 government bond fell 5.875 cents, the largest single\u2011day decline since the 2020 restructuring. Morgan Stanley had warned that a Mil\u00e9 defeat could trigger a 10\u2011point drop in international bonds and, on Monday, withdrew a recent \u2018buy\u2019 rating.\n\nAnalysts point to the political fallout: Mil\u00e9\u2019s sister, Karina Mil\u00e9, is embroiled in a corruption scandal, and the market has already lost about 20% in the past month. The peso\u2019s de\u2011peg has pressured the government to intervene in foreign\u2011exchange markets. UBS cautions that any instability in the currency market could trigger a chain reaction across Argentine assets; JPMorgan stresses that the government\u2019s policy choices in the coming weeks will determine inflation expectations and the success of its stabilization plan; Barclays warns that continued dollar sales by the finance ministry could erode confidence in the peso before the mid\u2011term elections.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has approved a $20\u202fbillion loan plan, with $15\u202fbillion already disbursed, but has not yet clarified whether election results will affect the cooperation. Analysts now see political risk as the biggest uncertainty ahead of the mid\u2011term elections, and the Mil\u00e9 administration\u2019s ability to balance currency stability, inflation control, and political pressure will directly influence the prospects of its reform agenda.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 01:35 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8mVADZQvJMT)\n\n**Problems of President Milei**\nPresident Javier\u202fMilei entered office promising a fresh political approach, but the realities of governance forced him to break many promises and shift his rhetoric. Early in his term he froze discretionary provincial transfers, cut superfluous spending, simplified administrative procedures, and halted 100\u202f% of public\u2011works projects\u2014moves that shocked the economic history of Argentina. In monetary policy he abandoned his liberal stance and adopted the interventionist ideas of Economy Minister Luis\u202fCaputo, committing to a crawling\u2011peg devaluation despite an initial 50\u202f% devaluation. Analysts were surprised, noting that the program resembled the failed devaluation strategy of Fern\u00e1ndez\u202fde\u202fHoz (1978\u20111981). The 2024 economy remained relatively stable, but by 2025 the crawling\u2011peg made Argentina \u201cextremely expensive\u201d; consumer goods were pricier than in Canada or Spain, imports surged, and many industries closed. Foreign investment fell to a negative 1.700\u202fmillion\u202fUSD, and 2\u202f200 military and security personnel requested resignations due to loss of purchasing power. In April\u202f2025 the government suspended the crawling\u2011peg, allowing a partial float; the dollar appreciated 20\u202f% and approached the band\u2019s ceiling, erasing the first 15\u202fmonths of devaluation policy in 30\u202fdays. To stave off inflation before the October\u202f2025 midterm elections, the government intervened in the futures market, buying dollars at 1\u202f200\u202fpesos, a move that caused losses of more than 500\u202fmillion\u202fUSD by April\u202f2026. Interest rates were raised to 40\u201150\u202f% nominal (64.82\u202f% effective in May\u202f2025), and the Central Bank increased reserve requirements from 45\u202f% to 53.5\u202f% to curb liquidity. Credit renewal became painful, leading to rising defaults. The author labels this \u201cthe Churchill effect,\u201d where political and financial interests override industrial and social ones. Milei\u2019s popularity fell in 2025 amid scandals such as the \u201cLibra\u2011Gate\u201d and unverified corruption allegations. The Mises Institute reconsidered awarding him for his supposed knowledge of the Austrian School, citing that his understanding is \u201csuperficial and deficient.\u201d The article concludes that Milei\u2019s government is playing a double\u2011or\u2011nothing game, and that after the elections he will have to change monetary policy again.

It traces the historical dominance of Peronism, noting its roots in Juan\u202fDomingo\u202fPer\u00f3n\u2019s 1946 election, its evolution through left\u2011 and right\u2011leaning phases, and its control of unions, subsidies, and state power, which has led to inflation, fiscal deficits, and structural inefficiency. The piece highlights the fragmentation of Peronism in the 21st\u202fcentury, the brief non\u2011Peronist presidency of Mauricio\u202fMacri, and the return of Peronism under Alberto\u202fFern\u00e1ndez and Cristina\u202fKirchner, during which inflation surged and the peso collapsed. Milei\u2019s rise is portrayed as a reaction to this long\u2011standing crisis; his platform calls for abolishing the central bank, exploring dollarization, cutting ministries from 18 to 9, deregulating markets, and ending subsidies, framing the campaign as a war against \u201cparasites feeding on the public.\u201d The article quotes the author\u2019s own phrasing: 'Milei's program was radical: abolish the central bank, explore dollarization, slash ministries from 18 to 9, deregulate markets, and end subsidies.' It also notes the immediate backlash\u2014higher food, fuel, and transport prices, union strikes, and legal challenges\u2014while emphasizing Milei\u2019s shift away from China and Brazil toward the United States and free\u2011market allies, describing this as an ideological stance of liberty versus authoritarianism. The author concludes that Milei\u2019s presidency is a gamble: if his policies succeed, inflation could fall, the peso could stabilize, and growth could return; if they fail, the country risks deeper poverty and inequality. The piece is framed as an analytical commentary on Argentina\u2019s political history and Milei\u2019s potential to break its cycle of crisis.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 02, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@meatballmicah/peronism-and-javier-milei-president-of-argentina-9e2a9208e9fb)\n\n**Argentina's Economic Challenges: A Stabilization Policy with Uncertain Outcomes**\nArgentina's President Javier Milei has implemented a policy to stabilize the exchange rate and reduce inflation. The policy involves limiting the devaluation of the peso to 2% per month until February 2025, and then to 1% per month until April 2025. This policy, known as the 'crawling-peg', aims to reduce inflation by limiting the devaluation of the peso. The government has also reduced public spending by 27% in 2024, which has led to a primary surplus and a reduction in the budget deficit. However, this policy has also led to a recession, with the GDP declining by 1.7% in 2024. The government has also implemented a law to encourage foreign investment, known as the 'Rigi' regime, which offers tax incentives to foreign investors. Despite these efforts, the Argentine economy is still facing challenges, including a high inflation rate, a large budget deficit, and a decline in foreign reserves. The government's ability to maintain a stable exchange rate and reduce inflation is uncertain, and some experts predict that a currency crisis is likely to occur in the near future.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 11, 2025 02:20 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/argentine-le-risque-dune-nouvelle-crise-monetaire-261412)\n\n**Milei's Economic Impact: A Painful Success or the Dawn of a New Argentina?**\nSince taking office on December 10, 2023, President Javier Milei's economic management has had a significant impact on Argentina's economy, with results that some have described as a 'economic miracle' in a context of prolonged crisis and historically high inflation. Before Milei's arrival, Argentina faced an annual inflation rate of nearly 211%, with over 50% of the population in a state of poverty. The economy was in recession due to years of exchange controls, high state intervention, and erratic economic policies. Milei managed to improve the economic environment and achieved a significant reduction in inflation. Despite not having a majority in Congress, he demonstrated political skill in negotiating with moderate sectors and passing key laws that promoted his economic agenda in a fragmented political scenario. Milei's government implemented a fiscal adjustment without precedent, significantly reducing public spending. This included the elimination or reduction of energy and transportation subsidies, the suspension of public works, and a significant reduction in public salaries and pensions. As a result of these policies, Argentina's monthly inflation rate decreased significantly, from 25.5% in December 2023 to 1.5% in May 2025, the lowest rate in five years. Although the accumulated inflation remains high, the deceleration of the monthly rate is a key indicator of a downward trend. The agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the acquisition of external financing were crucial for strengthening international reserves and sustaining economic policy without resorting to uncontrolled monetary emission. In summary, Milei's government has achieved a deep and, so far, successful economic adjustment in a country with a history of recurrent crises. His combination of fiscal discipline, structural reforms, political management, and economic opening has laid the foundations for Argentina to reduce inflation to historic lows and resume growth. However, social costs and political challenges persist. It is still too early to celebrate victory, but the economic results achieved to date have been very positive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[ruizhealytimes.com](https://ruizhealytimes.com/economia-y-negocios/el-impacto-economico-de-milei-un-exito-doloroso-o-el-amanecer-de-una-nueva-argentina/)\n\n**Milei's Economic Reforms: A Double-Edged Sword for Argentina**\nJavier Milei, the President of Argentina since 2023, has been criticized both positively and negatively since taking office. In this article, we will discuss whether he has saved or ruined the Argentine economy. Before we begin, we need to understand a few terms: liberalism, dollarization, hyperinflation, and shock therapy. Milei's core philosophy is libertarianism, which prioritizes individual freedoms and limited government intervention. His economic vision includes abandoning the Argentine peso and adopting the US dollar as the official currency, a process known as dollarization. This solution aims to combat hyperinflation, but it also carries risks, such as loss of control over monetary policy. Milei's policies are shaped by Argentina's extremely high inflation rates, which are a result of excessive money printing and fiscal indiscipline. Hyperinflation is a term used to describe economic instability caused by excessive money printing and lack of fiscal discipline. Milei's reforms are part of this context. Shock therapy, on the other hand, refers to radical and swift economic reforms to address economic problems. This approach is often used in countries transitioning from planned to market economies, as seen in Argentina today. Milei's shock therapy has achieved some positive results, including a budget surplus for the first time in 12 years and improvements in some key economic indicators. However, the radical nature of his approach has also led to significant social and economic costs, including job losses, reduced social benefits, and increased vulnerability of the middle class. The benefits of his policies, such as lower inflation and increased foreign investment, may not be felt by the general public, who are struggling to access basic necessities. If his current policies continue, Argentina's economy may experience a lasting recovery in areas such as low inflation, increased foreign investment, and budget discipline. However, there are also political risks involved, including potential social unrest, protests, and a decline in public support for Milei's government. If the public perception of poverty deepens, the gains made by his policies may become unsustainable.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 15, 2025 01:34 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@mehmetbayhan/liberalizmin-yeni-y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z%C4%B1-milei-arjantini-kurtarabilecek-mi-3a6a5dea0020)\n\n",

    "summary": "Seven experts from diverse disciplines analyzed the prospect of a U.S. bailout for Argentina before 2026, considering the criteria of a U.S. dollar transfer, swap line activation with BCRA drawdown, or U.S. purchase of Argentine sovereign bonds. The experts agree that the context is defined by Argentina's acute financial distress, the U.S. administration's public readiness to provide support (notably a $20 billion swap line), and strong ideological alignment between President Trump and President Milei. Factors increasing the probability of a bailout include: the high-level strategic importance to U.S. interests (both to prevent regional destabilization and counter Chinese influence); historical precedent for U.S.-backed interventions (especially IMF-led); the existence of ready institutional mechanisms (Fed swap lines, Treasury/ESF facilities); and the low bar for resolution (any swap line draw or dollar transfer suffices). Factors decreasing the probability include pronounced U.S. domestic political resistance (notably from Congress, agricultural lobbies, and fiscal conservatives), the traditional U.S. tendency to work through the IMF instead of direct bilateral bailouts, and the risk that headline announcements may not translate into concrete action before year-end.\n\nThe majority of experts forecast substantial odds (ranging from 65% to 93%) that some form of U.S. bailout will occur if Argentine financial conditions deteriorate further, especially after the October 26, 2025 Argentine midterms. They note that even a modest draw on the pre-announced swap line or a small technical loan could resolve the question as 'Yes,' with most expecting that escalating market pressures will trigger at least a symbolic intervention. A minority (notably from an IMF debt restructuring perspective) place the odds much lower (e.g., 40%), stressing persistently low base rates in U.S. bilateral bailouts, ambiguity in implementation, and the considerable risk of domestic or technical obstacles preventing execution. The central sources of uncertainty are the timing and form of support (outright and overt vs. technical and limited) and U.S. domestic pushback.\n\nIn summary, the expert consensus is that the probability of a U.S. bailout for Argentina before 2026 is significantly elevated due to public commitments, dire need, and strong executive incentives, but not a certainty given entrenched resistance and procedural ambiguity. The most likely scenario for a 'Yes' is a rapid, crisis-driven draw on the swap line or short-term dollar transfer post-elections, while a 'No' would result from continued verbal assurances and standby arrangements without any qualifying financial execution before the year ends.",
