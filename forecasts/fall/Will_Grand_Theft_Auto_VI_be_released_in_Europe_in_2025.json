While there is no plausible pathway visible now, the track record of global launches\u2014especially at this scale\u2014counsels for slightly more caution before assigning the lowest plausible nonzero probability. Black swan events do occur, and although their frequency is minute, the calibration ethos on forecasting platforms prefers not to compress residual risk to the strictest theoretical minimum.

The legal and regulatory landscape does not foster such surprises; if anything, it militates for even stricter launch discipline. The 1% allows for epistemic humility regarding outlandish, black-swan scenarios while communicating that all visible legal, market, and regulatory factors point to a vanishingly small\u2014but not logically impossible\u2014chance.

You convincingly document that no precedent exists for Rockstar or comparable publishers to move a launch forward following a public global delay\u2014especially one so recently reaffirmed in official statements, CEO interviews, and financial updates. Therefore, 6% effectively signals a frequency of surprise launches or catastrophic distribution reversals that is far higher than observed across the genre in recent decades. Your risk assessment acknowledges only tail-risk black swan scenarios, for which the historic occurrence is less than 1-in-100 for global entertainment blockbusters. In forecasting contests prioritizing sharpness, this is a case where rounding closer to 0% (such as 1%) better matches both the sufficiency of evidence and the logic of your narrative."

Several forecasters cited the base rate for an AAA region-first or accelerated release after a formal delay as effectively zero, though a handful allow a non-zero 'black swan' risk, largely for completeness. Compared to these, my 6% estimate sits at the upper end of the justified, plausible range, but is well-supported by the minor but nonzero uncertainty that always exists (for example, in the exceptional event of a leak misclassified as official, or an unexpected regional legal anomaly). No new information surfaced in deliberation that would warrant raising the probability. At the same time, the additional perspectives and uniformity reinforce that a lower-than-6% probability could be justified.

While my perspective as a distribution channel expert still holds that an authorized 2025 European release is extraordinarily unlikely according to all supply chain logic, the competition explicitly rewards justified extremeness\u2014but not at the cost of neglecting minute global uncertainties. Therefore, to reflect a true forecast competition best practice and the irreducible uncertainty argued by several peers, I am revising my probability slightly upward, from 1% to 6%.

However, the argument for even 6% is undercut by the magnitude of evidence and complete lack of precedent for Rockstar or similar publishers reversing a stated major delay\u2014especially on a regional basis.

Many forecasters make strong arguments for assigning a 1% probability, consistent with Metaculus norms of epistemic humility and extremely low historical base rates for early or surprise releases after global delay announcements of this magnitude. Arguments for maintaining a slightly higher probability (e.g., 6%) rely mainly on black-swan or tail risks\u2014such as digital storefront misfires or truly catastrophic errors\u2014but the effective base rate for such occurrences is lower than my initially implied.

No substantial new information or counterargument emerged to suggest a credible path to a 2025 release in Europe, and no additional uncertainty was raised that would justify increasing the forecast. Conversely, the arguments for a strict 1% probability were persuasive, and from a calibration perspective, are defensible given the overwhelming evidence. However, in competitive forecasting, the difference between 1% and 6% is marginal for extremely unlikely outcomes; my initial probability already accounted for this tail risk and aligns with the calibrated humility expected in Metaculus-style environments.

'It's worth noting that none of this has been officially confirmed by Rockstar,' said GameRoll, 'but it's what we know so far.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 04:39 PM\nSource:[\u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f](https://www.igromania.ru/news/151409/muzhskoj-striptiz-i-nikakih-kvartinyih-krazh-insajder-vyidal-koe-chto-o-gta-6/)\n\n**Grand Theft Auto VI Release Date, Platforms, Features & Price - Launching May 26, 2026**\nRockstar Games has announced that Grand Theft Auto VI will be released globally on May 26, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game was delayed from its initial 2025 release date, and Rockstar apologized for the delay. The game follows the story of two main characters, Lucia Caminos and Jason Duval, as they grow in the world of crime. New features include sneaking quietly, crawling, and moving bodies, adding a new way to play besides the usual action of running, driving, and fighting. The game will have a large game world, set in a place like Florida called Leonida, with cities, swamps, islands, and a national park. The game's system requirements have been revealed, with minimum and recommended specs for PC. The game's price has also been announced, with standard editions costing around $70 to $100 in the USA, and collector's editions costing over Rs 20,000 in India.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[The Hans India](https://www.thehansindia.com/tech/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-platforms-features-price-launching-may-26-2026-974340)\n\n**GTA VI Console Availability: What We Know So Far**\nThe release of Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI) is highly anticipated, but the certainty surrounding the game's console availability is scarce. According to Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two and owner of Rockstar Games, the software house will not release every title on every available platform, citing economic and technical reasons. The game is expected to be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on May 26, 2026, with a PC version to follow approximately a year later, in the spring of 2027. However, it is unlikely that the game will be released on the Nintendo Switch 2 or previous-generation consoles, such as the PS4 and Xbox One, due to the game's high system requirements. As Zelnick stated, 'we will not bring every title to every platform,' suggesting that the game's optimization for less powerful hardware is not a priority at this time.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 18, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Tecnoandroid](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2025/05/18/gta-vi-quali-sono-le-console-su-cui-potra-si-potra-giocare-il-titolo-rockstar-games-1565974/)\n\n**Grand Theft Auto VI: Strauss Zelnick Expressed Confidence in Release Date**\nTake-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has expressed confidence that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be delayed further, despite previous speculation. The game was initially set for release in the fall of 2025, but was pushed back to May 26, 2026. However, Jason Schreier from Bloomberg noted that 'there's no guarantee that May 2026 is a sure thing.' Zelnick stated that the delay was necessary to ensure that Rockstar Games could achieve 'perfection' without any limitations, saying 'we were able to take a small increment of time to ensure that Rockstar Games could achieve its creative vision without any constraints.' The game is set to release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on May 26, 2026.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 16, 2025 07:57 AM\nSource:[gameswelt.de](https://www.gameswelt.de/grand-theft-auto-vi/news/bleibts-beim-neuen-release-termin-ceo-ist-zuversichtlich-330562)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that the probability of Grand Theft Auto VI being released in Europe in 2025 is extremely low, citing Rockstar and Take-Two's clear and repeated official announcements delaying the release to May 26, 2026. Forecasters from a variety of backgrounds\u2014including AAA game publishing, distribution management, entertainment law, game studies, business strategy, and European regulatory analysis\u2014concur that Rockstar\u2019s history and business incentives make a 2025 European release implausible. They point to the publisher\u2019s strict adherence to synchronized global launches and the logistical, legal, and marketing complexities that large-scale, blockbuster releases entail. No credible evidence or historical precedent exists for advancing an official delay of this magnitude, especially for a title of GTA VI's prominence. Potential scenarios for a 2025 release (last-minute corporate reversal, accidental retail release, unexpected demo qualifying under resolution criteria) are uniformly characterized as 'black swan' events\u2014possible in theory but unsupported by any factual developments. Probabilities assigned are either 0%, 1%, or at most 6% (allowing for minimal black swan risks), reflecting near certainty that no standard, authorized GTA VI sales will occur in Europe during 2025.",
