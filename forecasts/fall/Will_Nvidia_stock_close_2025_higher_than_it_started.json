However, historical base rates for mega-cap stocks after rallying 100%+ in a year suggest caution: only a small minority sustain further gains in the subsequent period, especially in the face of rising competitive threats (Broadcom, in-house chips) and signs of revenue deceleration (56% YoY vs. 122% prior year). Multiple articles point to growing sector competition, high valuations, and possible risk from client verticalization, while macro headwinds lurk. Bullish consensus targets and continued sector rotation risk underscore a highly polarized situation. My DCF-weighted assessment leans toward a modest downward tilt (earnings mean reversion and de-rating risk outweigh short-term positive momentum). Thus, the initial base rate is close to my starting probability of 4%, slightly raised for the durability of AI-tailwinds and positive analyst sentiment, but brought back in line by the DCF 'gravity' and bubble-peak signals.

However, the competitive threat from custom silicon and vertical integration, alongside potential regulatory/macro shocks, cannot be ignored.

However, from a fundamental finance (bottom-up) perspective, your 87% probability may marginally underweight how much of a buffer Nvidia has built into its price above the $134.29 mark, especially considering its fortress balance sheet, sector leadership, and reinforcing strategic partnerships (e.g., the Intel collaboration). The probability of a >24% drop within three months, absent catastrophic economic or market-wide turmoil, is quite low historically for companies with Nvidia\u2019s fundamental profile. While business cycle turning points do inject some additional volatility, the specifics of Nvidia's competitive moat and sustained earnings growth render such a sharp drop less likely than your estimate suggests. Your treatment potentially overemphasizes broad business cycle mean reversion versus firm-specific growth durability. A slightly higher probability could be justified from a granular, bottom-up standpoint."

DCF models often fail to account for the stubbornness of crowd beliefs and herding effects in the short term, especially for large, index-leading growth stocks. In similar historical episodes, even hyper-valued equities have rarely experienced such deep drawdowns absent a market-wide or existential catalyst\u2014and such events are themselves often buffered by central bank and passive investment flows near year-end.

Your approach sensibly weighs time horizon, recent market structure, and analyst consensus\u2014all factors that would prompt prudent portfolio managers to underweight the probability of a deep correction in the near term. Whereas DCF purists may overstate downside scenarios across all periods, you correctly adjust for residual time to year-end and the low recent historical frequency of such acute reversals under similar conditions for leading tech constituents.

From an Industry Life Cycle viewpoint, your reasoning judiciously recognizes that, even as the sector matures and mean-reversion risk rises, companies with fortress fundamentals, enormous addressable market growth, and continued first-mover advantages rarely see quick, multi-quarter drawdowns absent broad systemic shocks. By being explicit about the rarity of >24% declines for such stocks over a brief three-month window, your 96% probability is credibly high without being dogmatic.

While my DCF orientation emphasizes mean reversion, competitive shift risk, and valuation 'gravity,' the time window is brief and there is no obvious near-term catalyst for a 23%+ drawdown. The DCF model's warnings are better suited to longer horizons or when the price is closer to justified value, but in this context, market structure, analyst momentum, and technical factors weigh more heavily in the short term.

On the other hand, the defense of the Behavioral Finance argument supports moderation by emphasizing the ongoing momentum and sector psychology that make a rapid full reversal unlikely absent a material catalyst. The additional perspectives from DCF, Portfolio Theory, and Macroeconomic Business Cycle Theory also converge toward a moderately high, but not absolute, level of confidence.

The arguments from portfolio theory and EMH\u2014especially that downside of this extent is historically rare outside major exogenous events\u2014are especially persuasive. While not discounting downside risks or the possibility of sudden sentiment reversals, it appears my original forecast underweighted the persistence of positive drift and overestimated the immediacy of DCF-based gravity in the remaining period.

Still, none provide new evidence or scenarios that would make a >23% decline in Nvidia over the short remaining window probable absent substantial systemic or company-specific shock.

Critiques of excessively high or low forecasts were primarily rooted in the weighting of tail risk and mean reversion over very short windows. My own fundamental analysis triangulates with the most robust arguments for a high probability: the current price buffer (>25% above the threshold), continued earnings momentum, strong sector and index support, and the improbability of a company-specific or macro shock erasing that buffer in just three months. The critiques did not reveal material oversights in my original reasoning, and the only scenario for a substantial drop appears to be an outsized tail event.

Critiques of lower estimates (e.g., the DCF's 7%) convincingly highlight the tendency of traditional modelers to underestimate the power of behavioral/narrative inertia, especially in late-stage rallies or window-dressing season. However, I continue to weigh the real but low-probability risk of a sharp sentiment shift or macro event, as well as the competing risk that valuation mean-reversion can overwhelm all narratives more quickly than anticipated.

Portfolio Theory and Behavioral Finance both underscore that a >24% drop within three months in the absence of a very large exogenous shock is a statistically rare tail event, especially for a mega-cap tech leader so central to current thematic and index construction. My initial emphasis on business cycle reversion and elevated multiple risk is valid but, with less than a full quarter to year-end, the magnitude of competitive headwinds and mean-reversion risk are likely not sufficient to overwhelm the current technical and market environment in such a short span. DCF gravity is a legitimate long-term caution, but is appropriately discounted in the short-term view.

Analysts project that AMD could reach a 20\u202f% market share in GPUs while already holding 41\u202f% of the server\u2011CPU market.\n\nNvidia, founded in 1999, pioneered the GeForce 256 and has since produced over 15 GPU generations, culminating in the Ada\u2011Lovelace and upcoming Blackwell architectures. Under CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has dominated the AI accelerator market with an estimated 80\u201390\u202f% share, thanks to its vertically integrated hardware, networking and CUDA software stack. In the first quarter of 2025/26, Nvidia\u2019s revenue rose to 44.06\u202fbillion\u202fUSD, a 69.2\u202f% increase from the previous year, and the company invested 2.71\u202fbillion\u202fUSD in the UK to build a robust AI ecosystem.\n\nThe demand for high\u2011performance GPUs and APUs for generative AI has exploded. Nvidia\u2019s proprietary CUDA ecosystem and strong relationships with hyperscalers give it a competitive edge, while AMD counters with an open\u2011source ROCm platform and a focus on mid\u2011tier, server and gaming markets. The article notes that Nvidia\u2019s stock rose over 40\u202f% in September 2025, whereas AMD\u2019s shares dipped slightly, reflecting market tension and investor sentiment.\n\nIn summary, the \"boss\u2011fight\" between AMD and Nvidia is driven by differing strategies: Nvidia relies on vertical integration and market dominance in high\u2011end and AI segments, whereas AMD pursues flexibility, open software and expansion into gaming, data centers and AI. The outcome will depend on technology, strategy, timing and investor confidence.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 03:03 PM\nSource:[wallstreet:online](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/19943942-pixel-power-prestige-ki-boss-fight-grafik-giganten-amd-nvidia-endlos-game)\n\n**What Makes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) an Investment Bet?**\nMacquarie Asset Management\u2019s \u2018Macquarie Core Equity Fund\u2019 investor letter for Q2\u202f2025 reported the fund\u2019s Institutional Class returned 11.94%, outperforming the S&P\u202f500\u00ae Index\u2019s 10.94% rise.

Broadcom\u2019s recent quarterly results showed robust year\u2011over\u2011year growth and a $10\u202fbillion order of custom AI chips (XPUs) from an unnamed customer, which Citi says strengthens Broadcom\u2019s position. Based on these developments, Citi estimates that NVIDIA\u2019s 2026 GPU sales will be roughly 4\u202f% lower than previously forecast and that competition from Broadcom and Google\u2019s increasingly competitive tensor processing units (TPUs) could reduce NVIDIA\u2019s GPU sales by about $12\u202fbillion in 2026. The firm notes that Broadcom\u2019s faster XPU adoption, driven by Google\u2019s shift to compete with NVIDIA by offering compute capacity to rivals such as Meta, OpenAI, and Oracle, poses a growing threat. While acknowledging NVIDIA\u2019s AI\u2011driven solutions, Citi suggests other AI stocks may offer greater upside potential and lower downside risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The article notes that Broadcom\u2019s deal is part of a broader trend of major tech firms\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Meta\u2014developing proprietary processors to cut costs and fine\u2011tune AI performance. HSBC analysts warned that the custom silicon market could grow faster than Nvidia\u2019s general\u2011purpose GPU business by 2026. Nvidia\u2019s stock has been volatile, with 19 moves over 5% in the past year; the recent decline is seen as a market reaction to the news rather than a fundamental shift. The article also references Nvidia\u2019s Q2 earnings beat, a slight miss in data\u2011center revenue, and a Q3 forecast that matched consensus, which disappointed investors expecting a larger beat. A weak forecast from peer Marvell Technology added further pressure.

The decline was driven mainly by the Magnificent 7 tech names \u2013 Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META) \u2013 which led the downturn. Investor anxiety was heightened by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments about a potential market bubble and an MIT study showing weak corporate returns from AI investments. The possibility of government intervention in the semiconductor sector, specifically an equity stake in Intel (INTC), also weighed on sentiment. Market participants are rotating out of high\u2011valuation tech shares into defensive sectors ahead of Fed Chair Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium, dragging the broader S&P 500 lower. Analysts view the move as a healthy rotation rather than a prolonged downturn, noting that technology stocks have risen roughly 40% from April lows. Profit\u2011taking, stretched valuations, and seasonal weakness typical of August\u2011September are cited as contributing factors, with expectations that any Fed signals about rate cuts could quickly reverse the negative trend.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a strong consensus that Nvidia is highly likely to close 2025 above its January 2, 2025 adjusted price of $134.29, with current trading levels offering a significant cushion (30%+ above the threshold as of September 2025). The dominant factors supporting a 'Yes' resolution include ongoing robust AI/datacenter demand fueling Nvidia\u2019s earnings and revenue growth, continued technical and institutional strength, substantial analyst price targets (median $212), new partnerships (notably, with Intel), and persistent market sentiment and momentum in the tech sector. Most experts see the recent price surge (and Nvidia's dominant market position) as sustainable for the remainder of 2025 except in the event of a major sector meltdown or extraordinary negative shock. \n\nHowever, all forecasters also note real risks\u2014mean reversion after hyperbolic rallies, increasing competition from hyperscalers' custom chips and Broadcom collaborations, heightened valuation metrics (P/B, P/S), and potential macroeconomic shocks (Fed policy, sector rotation, or a broad tech selloff). While downside risk is nontrivial (especially given historical base rates for mega-cap corrections post-bubble runs), the short time frame remaining and the current price buffer substantially reduce the likelihood of a 'No' outcome barring a black swan event.\n\nProbability estimates mostly cluster between 87% and 96%, with the exception of the DCF-oriented analyst who is more cautious at 7% (outlier, likely reflecting an extreme view on valuation mean-reversion and risk). All other models\u2014portfolio theory, EMH, fundamental, behavioral, macro, industry cycle\u2014align around the high 80s or low to mid-90s percent range, viewing the probability of Nvidia closing above $134.29 at year-end as overwhelmingly high unless upended by unforeseen events.",
