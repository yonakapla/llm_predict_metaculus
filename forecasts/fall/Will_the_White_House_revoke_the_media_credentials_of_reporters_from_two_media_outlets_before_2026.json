While the administration is clearly eager to punish and sideline non-friendly coverage\u2014sometimes via overt pressure\u2014the actual historical record in both Trump terms is that explicit, formal revocations are rare due to strong institutional, legal, and reputational checks, and media organizations\u2019 ability to mount immediate and successful challenges. The largest credential revocations so far (October 2025) appear attributable to the Pentagon, not the White House per se; similarly, the WHCA remains vigilant and would publicize, challenge, and litigate any attempt that meets the explicit bar of this Metaculus question. The deadline is now extremely near (less than six weeks), and while final-year-of-term escalation is plausible, almost all signals (news coverage, press releases, WHCA bulletins, and major news org statements) suggest the current status quo is one of procedural restriction, intimidation, and pool manipulation\u2014but not openly announced credential revocation from two or more separate outlets by the President's office. I estimate a base rate for such action, in the absence of a triggering, high-profile confrontation, at under 10%. Because the risk clearly has risen with all the November 2025 events, I assign a slightly higher probability\u2014especially knowing that final-week provocations are possible\u2014but place the chance well below 50%.",

The time left is very short and, despite a fevered rhetorical environment, there is still no credible report of qualifying White House action, while the legal incentives for maintaining ambiguity instead of outright revocation are strong. Upon reflection, the balance of evidence aligns more closely with the 15\u201330% range advocated by some other forecasters, and my first estimate was too close to a coin flip. I am revising my probability downward to better reflect the distinctive and still-unmet bar for question resolution.",

The collective deliberation consistently focused on the critical distinction between restrictive/institutional hostility (access, pool manipulation, Pentagon revocations) and the absence of a direct, credible, publicly announced White House multi-outlet credential revocation. Multiple experts from legal, media, and political science domains converged on the point that White House legal and reputational risk remains a high institutional barrier, and that all major hostile actions this year have carefully stopped short of triggering the precise scenario outlined in the resolution criteria. The timeline is very short, and the observable pattern to date is aggressive restriction without formalized credential removal. High outlier probabilities (e.g. 68%) were justly critiqued as overreactive to environment rather than evidence. The modal expert range is now below my initial 40%, commonly between 15% and 25%, with the strongest arguments citing historical reluctance to trigger mass White House credential revocation versus the Pentagon case. While I continue to see risk as much higher than historical base rate, the consensus and evidence push me to reduce my confidence. I am updating my forecast downward.",

My peers distinguished with clarity that nearly all high-profile revocations and ejections, no matter how unprecedented, have emanated from the Pentagon and not the core White House credentialing authority. The strongest arguments made were that (a) all fine-print-compliant credential removals at the White House remain either nonexistent or unpublicized, (b) legal, institutional, and reputational brakes are potent, and (c) the administration\u2019s pattern is one of indirect attrition\u2014preferring access games, pool restriction, and pressuring noncompliance over incurring the acute risks of formal, headline-making multi-outlet revocations. The Acosta precedent and the silence (to date) of any credible reports of such specific revocations must be weighted heavily, especially with the time window shrinking. The base rate, even in this highly abnormal administration, remains lower for this *exact* outcome than my initial call. While the possibility of a last-minute escalation still exists, the likelihood is much closer to the upper end of the mainstream expert consensus\u2014elevated above normal, but far from a tossup or likelihood. I am therefore reducing my forecast sharply to 27%, in line with the more persuasive, evidence-anchored arguments and the lack of any new, direct evidence supporting an imminent qualifying White House revocation.",

The key points highlighted repeatedly are: 1) All mass credential revocations to date have been Pentagon-based, not directly from the White House; 2) The White House has favored less legislatively and reputationally risky tools like access reshuffling, not explicit credential pulls; 3) The remaining time window is shrinking, making sudden, major, formal changes less likely without a fresh crisis; 4) The legal and PR risks of direct revocation are apparent, with precedent like the Acosta litigation acting as a deterrent; 5) No credible sources currently report a threshold-meeting event. Deliberation did not surface any overlooked news or analysis that would suggest I underestimated the risk\u2014in fact, the comparison to mid-20s and high-40s probabilities reinforces that an extremely low (but not zero) probability is best matched to the current evidence and institutional brakes.

The news demonstrates a uniquely hostile atmosphere and numerous procedural access restrictions, but actual, qualifying White House credential revocations (as per the question fine print) remain absent as of late November 2025. The very short window before resolution means a sudden change is technically possible but operationally unlikely without a dramatic, catalyzing incident.

President Trump publicly reprimanded ABC News reporter Mary Bruce, calling her 'insubordinate' and a 'terrible person,' and urged FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke ABC's broadcast license after she questioned Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s ties to the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Vice President JD Vance openly advocated for Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, to hire Matthew Boyle\u2014a conservative editor from Breitbart\u2014calling him 'the most well-sourced journalist in Washington, D.C.' and stating he should run the Post\u2019s entire political reporting shop. Though Bezos did not comply, Vance\u2019s public endorsement normalized backchannel political interference. Boyle, known for Breitbart\u2019s 'Black crime' vertical and past calls for the 'full destruction' of mainstream media, was seated beside Vance as a central ideologue. Meanwhile, Larry Ellison, a major stakeholder in Paramount Skydance, reportedly held informal talks with White House officials about acquiring CNN, with the goal of replacing critical hosts like Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar. Trump, who has long labeled the press the 'enemy of the people,' previously demanded the immediate firing of CNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand after she reported on limited U.S. military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. These actions\u2014targeting newsroom leadership, pushing for media ownership shifts, and leveraging regulatory power\u2014reflect a pattern of institutional capture, a hallmark of authoritarianism.

Trump criticized Muir's approach, stating, 'You know, it's not the question that I mind. It's your attitude. I think you are a terrible reporter,' and added that the same question could be asked more respectfully. He extended the criticism to ABC as a network, calling it 'fake,' 'crappy,' and a 'perpetrator' of hoaxes. Trump urged FCC Chair Brendan Carr, whom he appointed in January 2025, to investigate ABC\u2019s license. This follows a prior FCC warning in September 2025, when Carr threatened action after Jimmy Kimmel criticized conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination. Trump also addressed the Epstein Files controversy, denying any connection to Jeffrey Epstein and claiming he expelled him from his club 'many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.' Despite this, Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Epstein Files as a 'hoax' orchestrated by Democrats. However, on the same day as his meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act by a 427\u20131 vote, with nearly all Republican members supporting the release of the documents\u2014up from only four Republicans initially backing a petition for a vote.

President Donald Trump, who hosted the event with evident camaraderie toward the guest, emphasized business deals, including the potential sale of advanced American aircraft to Saudi Arabia, and the kingdom's ambitions to become a global hub for sports and futuristic city development. Saudi Arabia has already secured major events like the Dakar Rally and signed numerous high-profile football players.

However, tensions arose when ABC News asked about the 2018 assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, a case the U.S. government had previously attributed to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump dismissed the question, labeled ABC News as a 'fake news' outlet, threatened to revoke its license, and claimed Khashoggi was a 'controversial' figure, implying his death was justified. The President also reacted angrily when questions turned to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Despite the diplomatic spectacle, including a lavish dinner featuring Cristiano Ronaldo and Elon Musk, the article underscores the suppression of critical journalism. The piece warns that traditional media face unprecedented attacks, with the goal of silencing scrutiny over Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record and past atrocities. The author raises urgent concerns about the erosion of press freedom and the increasing danger for journalists who investigate powerful figures, citing Khashoggi\u2019s murder as a chilling warning to others.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 11:45 AM\nSource:[Semanario SOL](https://sol.sapo.pt/2025/11/22/as-perguntas-que-nao-se-podem-fazer/)\n\n**Trump wants to tell CNN who to hire**\nIn November 2025, during the first week of Donald Trump's second presidency, a series of events revealed a coordinated effort by MAGA figures to exert control over major media institutions. President Trump publicly reprimanded ABC News reporter Mary Bruce, calling her 'insubordinate' and a 'terrible person,' and urged FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke ABC's broadcast license after she questioned Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s ties to the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Vice President JD Vance openly advocated for Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, to hire Matthew Boyle\u2014a conservative editor from Breitbart\u2014calling him 'the most well-sourced journalist in Washington, D.C.' and stating he should run the Post\u2019s entire political reporting shop. Though Bezos did not comply, Vance\u2019s public endorsement normalized backchannel political interference. Boyle, known for Breitbart\u2019s 'Black crime' vertical and past calls for the 'full destruction' of mainstream media, was seated beside Vance as a central ideologue. Meanwhile, Larry Ellison, a major stakeholder in Paramount Skydance, reportedly held informal talks with White House officials about acquiring CNN, with the goal of replacing critical hosts like Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar. Trump, who has long labeled the press the 'enemy of the people,' previously demanded the immediate firing of CNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand after she reported on limited U.S. military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. These actions\u2014targeting newsroom leadership, pushing for media ownership shifts, and leveraging regulatory power\u2014reflect a pattern of institutional capture, a hallmark of authoritarianism. The White House\u2019s public embrace of such interference signals a strategic effort to reshape mainstream media through ideological loyalty, personnel control, and regulatory pressure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 11:45 AM\nSource:[Salon.com](https://www.salon.com/2025/11/22/trumps-white-house-wants-to-tell-cnn-wapo-who-to-hire-and-fire/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ogshare&utm_content=og)\n\n**Why Did Trump Make Offensive Remarks About a Female Journalist?**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump faced widespread criticism for making derogatory remarks about a female journalist's appearance during a press briefing on November 14, 2025, on his presidential aircraft. According to the article, Trump pointed his index finger at the journalist from Bloomberg News and shouted, 'Shut up, shut up. Pig,' after she repeatedly questioned him about documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The outburst occurred when he became visibly agitated during her persistent questioning. The White House defended Trump, with Press Secretary Karoline Levitt stating in a November 20 press briefing that Trump is 'very straightforward and honest' and that his directness reflects 'respectful' behavior, contrasting it with secretive conduct. However, significant criticism emerged: CNN anchor Jake Tapper condemned the remarks on X (formerly Twitter) as 'extremely unpleasant and completely unacceptable,' while Bloomberg's editorial leadership affirmed that the journalist had acted professionally and without fear or favor, pledging continued fair and accurate reporting on matters of public interest. This is not the first incident\u2014on November 18, Trump similarly berated a female ABC News reporter, calling her a 'terrible journalist' and threatening to revoke her broadcast license over the same topic.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20251122/k00/00m/030/129000c)\n\n**The Press vs. Trump: Insults and Power Moves Behind the Scenes**\nThe article critiques the escalating conflict between Donald Trump and the press, highlighting how his administration has increasingly targeted journalists who challenge him, particularly women. During a joint press conference with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump insulted ABC News reporter Mary Bruce, calling her a 'terrible journalist' and threatening to revoke her network\u2019s license after she asked about the Saudi monarch\u2019s role in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump\u2019s business ties to Saudi Arabia, and the Jeffrey Epstein files. The White House justified the outburst as 'frankness' and 'honesty,' but the article argues this is a justification rather than a genuine apology. Since Trump\u2019s second term began, he has expanded control over press access, including to the Oval Office and media assignments. The article also reveals broader media consolidation efforts: Paramount Skydance, linked to Trump ally David Ellison, is nearing a purchase of Warner Bros Discovery\u2014owner of CNN, which Trump has repeatedly labeled 'fake news.' In July, Paramount paid Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over a CBS interview, and shortly after, canceled Stephen Colbert\u2019s show, a known Trump critic. The piece concludes that while journalists face public humiliation, the real power players are quietly advancing corporate deals aligned with their interests.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 05:10 AM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/opinion/columnistas/la-prensa-vs-trump-por-gisella-lopez-lenci-noticia/)\n\n**Trump's 'Quiet Down, Piggy' Outburst Sparks Backlash, White House Defends 'Honest' President Amid Media Tensions**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump faced widespread backlash from the media and women's groups after making a derogatory remark, 'Quiet down, piggy,' toward a female journalist during a press briefing on November 14, 2025. The incident occurred when a female reporter asked about the delayed release of the Epstein files. The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) condemned the comment and another similar incident involving Trump\u2019s criticism of an ABC female reporter during a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, calling it a repeated pattern of hostile behavior targeting women that undermines independent journalism. Despite the backlash, the White House defended Trump, with Press Secretary Caroline Levitt stating that Trump is 'very honest and straightforward,' and that his transparency and willingness to call out 'fake news' were key reasons Americans re-elected him. Levitt also claimed Trump is the 'most transparent president in history,' citing unprecedented media access, while criticizing the previous Biden administration for not engaging with the press. In response, comedian Jimmy Kimmel, a long-time critic of Trump, mocked the president on his November 20 show, saying, 'When you leave, I\u2019ll leave too... until then, quiet down, piggy,' directly quoting Trump\u2019s offensive remark. Kimmel also highlighted that Trump\u2019s post criticizing him aired just 11 minutes after his show ended. Kimmel had previously faced a temporary cancellation in September under conservative pressure but returned after strong support from Disney and viewers, with ratings rising. Trump has also targeted other comedians, including NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers, calling him 'unskilled' and demanding he be fired. The incident reflects an ongoing pattern of Trump publicly attacking media figures who criticize him.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 01:15 AM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u0179\ufffd](https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/international/2025/11/22/20251122500010)\n\n**Trump Threatens to Revoke ABC's License Over Reporter's 'Attitude' and Questions on Epstein Files**\nOn November 19, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to revoke ABC's broadcast license, citing the 'attitude' and questioning style of reporter David Muir during a press briefing. Trump criticized Muir's approach, stating, 'You know, it's not the question that I mind. It's your attitude. I think you are a terrible reporter,' and added that the same question could be asked more respectfully. He extended the criticism to ABC as a network, calling it 'fake,' 'crappy,' and a 'perpetrator' of hoaxes. Trump urged FCC Chair Brendan Carr, whom he appointed in January 2025, to investigate ABC\u2019s license. This follows a prior FCC warning in September 2025, when Carr threatened action after Jimmy Kimmel criticized conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination. Trump also addressed the Epstein Files controversy, denying any connection to Jeffrey Epstein and claiming he expelled him from his club 'many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.' Despite this, Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Epstein Files as a 'hoax' orchestrated by Democrats. However, on the same day as his meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act by a 427\u20131 vote, with nearly all Republican members supporting the release of the documents\u2014up from only four Republicans initially backing a petition for a vote. Trump later withdrew his opposition to the bill.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2025 06:17 AM\nSource:[ibtimes.com](https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-threatens-revoke-abcs-license-over-reporters-attitude-questions-epstein-files-3790734)\n\n**White House Tightens Journalist Access Rules Amid Escalating Media Restrictions**\nThe White House has tightened access rules for journalists, restricting entry to the 'Upper Press' area in the West Wing\u2014home to President Trump's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt\u2014without prior authorization. According to a National Security Council memo, the change aims to protect 'sensitive' information, as the press office also handles NSC communications. Communications Director Steven Cheung claimed journalists had previously ambushed staff and secretly recorded audio/video, though no evidence was provided. Journalists may still access the 'Lower Press' area adjacent to the main press room, as noted in the memo. The rule took effect immediately. The White House Correspondents' Association criticized the move, arguing it undermines media access and transparency. This restriction is part of a broader pattern of strained relations between Trump\u2019s second administration and the press. Similar measures were introduced by the Pentagon earlier in November 2025, requiring media organizations to sign a new policy banning publication of unapproved information\u2014risking loss of accreditation. At least 30 outlets, including Reuters, AP, AFP, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and major networks like CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox News, rejected the rule, losing direct access. They were replaced by over 60 government-aligned journalists from so-called 'new media.' The administration framed this as a 'new beginning' and a shift from 'mainstream media lies' to 'real news.' This follows earlier actions in which Reuters, AP, and Bloomberg were removed from the official presidential press pool.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 02:28 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/de/wei%C3%9Fes-haus-versch%C3%A4rft-regeln-f%C3%BCr-reporter/a-74585209)\n\n**White House Limits Reporters' Access to Press Secretary's Office**\nThe Trump administration announced on November 1, 2025, a significant restriction on White House reporters' access to 'Upper Press'\u2014a section of the West Wing housing the press secretary and senior press aides\u2014requiring prior appointments for entry. This move breaks with decades of precedent, ending the long-standing practice of free access for journalists to ask impromptu questions. The administration cited security concerns over 'sensitive material' related to the National Security Council, though the area is actually a few rooms away from the Oval Office, not adjacent. Journalists can still access 'Lower Press,' a smaller area near the briefing room. The White House Correspondents' Association strongly opposed the change, stating it undermines transparency and accountability. President Trump\u2019s communications director, Steven Cheung, claimed some reporters had secretly recorded sensitive material without permission. This policy is part of a broader pattern of media restrictions under the Trump administration, including limiting the press pool, revoking credentials, and suing news organizations. In 1993, a similar Clinton-era ban was reversed after backlash. The administration claims to prioritize transparency and accessibility, particularly for nontraditional media, while criticizing mainstream outlets as biased. Despite these claims, the new restrictions have been widely seen as a step toward limiting press freedom.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 01:51 AM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/trump-white-house-press.html)\n\n**Break with Traditional Media: Journalists Depart Pentagon as Government-Friendly Outlets Take Over**\nThe U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) has replaced much of its established press corps with journalists from government-aligned 'new media' outlets, citing a 'new beginning' and the need for 'real news' instead of 'lies from mainstream media.' Over 60 journalists from these outlets and independent reporters have been granted access after signing controversial new media guidelines, which require prior approval from the Pentagon before publishing any information\u2014failure to comply risks losing accreditation. The move follows a major conflict between the Pentagon and nearly all major U.S. media organizations, including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and the New York Times, which refused to sign the 21-page rulebook. As a result, journalists were required to surrender their credentials and vacate their positions, which the Pentagon described as 'self-deportations.' President Trump defended the stricter access rules, expressing concern that generals might 'make mistakes' with journalists. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated on X that access to the Pentagon is 'a privilege, not a right.' Only One America News (OAN) and a few small, government-friendly platforms signed the rules. The Pentagon claims these new media outlets have 'created a formula to bypass the lies of mainstream media and deliver real news to Americans.' This change is part of a broader effort by the administration to restrict access for independent media: earlier in the year, the White House Press Pool was restructured, excluding major agencies like AP, Reuters, and Bloomberg, and replacing them with right-leaning bloggers and social media influencers. The shift followed a dispute with the Associated Press, which refused to adopt Trump\u2019s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America.' In response, the White House revoked the WHCA\u2019s control over the press pool and assumed direct authority. Additionally, in July 2024, the Wall Street Journal was excluded from a presidential trip to Scotland due to prior reporting on alleged ties between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein. The White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt justified the exclusion by citing the publication\u2019s 'defamatory behavior.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 04:26 AM\nSource:[GMX News](https://www.gmx.ch/magazine/politik/us-politik/bruch-klassischen-medien-journalisten-verlassen-pentagon-41509738)\n\n**Pro-Trump outlets flock to the Pentagon under new media policy**\nOver 60 journalists from new media outlets and independent reporters have received Pentagon press credentials under a new Trump administration policy, according to Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell. The policy requires journalists to agree not to report information not approved for release by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Outlets including TurningPoint USA\u2019s Frontlines, Mike Lindell\u2019s Lindell TV, RedState, Human Events, the Post Millennial, Washington Reporter, Gateway Pundit, and National Pulse (run by UK far-right figure Raheem Kassam) have signed on. Traditional outlets like Fox News, The Washington Post, AP, and others refused to comply. On October 15, journalists from non-compliant outlets surrendered their press passes in protest. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press urged the Pentagon to pause the policy due to unclear language that could lead to credential revocation for reporting unapproved information. While the Pentagon later clarified that journalists remain free to gather information through legitimate means, the Pentagon Press Association criticized the policy as a one-sided move to restrict public access to unapproved information. The Defense Department has previously revoked workspaces from major news organizations, including POLITICO, The Washington Post, and The New York Times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 08:15 PM\nSource:[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/pentagon-trump-press-corps-00619002)\n\n**The Pentagon's New Press Policy Sparks Mass Exodus of Media, Igniting Free Speech Debate**\nNearly all major U.S. media outlets with reporters based at the Pentagon have withdrawn their credentials in protest against a new press policy imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News presenter. The policy, which has been criticized as a threat to First Amendment rights, includes strict access limitations and the potential for sanctions\u2014such as credential revocation\u2014for journalists who request information on matters of public interest, even if the information is not classified. Major outlets including ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, Associated Press, Reuters, Bloomberg, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, The Atlantic, Financial Times, Politico, NPR, The Hill, and NewsNation have publicly refused to sign the policy. The only media outlet to accept it is the far-right One America News Network, known for its favorable coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s administration. As a result, for the first time since Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s presidency, no major news organizations will have permanent reporters at the Pentagon. Around 40 journalists left the facility before the deadline, citing the policy as a violation of press freedom. The Pentagon Press Association confirmed that nearly all major media credentials have been revoked. The New York Times and other outlets warn the policy could criminalize reporting on national security and expose journalists to prosecution. Despite opposition from traditionally Republican-aligned media like Fox News and Newsmax, Donald Trump publicly supported Hegseth\u2019s move, calling the press 'very dishonest' and criticizing journalists for questioning military personnel. Although journalists are not technically banned from reporting, the policy creates a presumption that requesting information could be deemed a 'security risk.' Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked the U.S. 57th in its 2025 World Press Freedom Index, citing a significant deterioration under Trump\u2019s second term, including politicization of institutions, reduced support for independent media, the closure of local news outlets, and the termination of federal funding for the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which has severely impacted global media coverage.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 08:43 AM\nSource:[El HuffPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/global/penta.html)\n\n**'A Sad Day for Free Press': Pentagon Revokes Accreditations of Journalists Refusing New Rules**\nOn October 16, 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense revoked the press credentials of journalists from approximately 30 major media organizations, including The Washington Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, AP, Reuters, FOX News, Newsmax, The Washington Examiner, and The Daily Caller, after they refused to comply with new rules restricting their access to information. The new regulations prohibit journalists from seeking information not officially authorized for release, with violations potentially deemed 'a threat to security' and leading to loss of press credentials. The journalists were required to formally agree to these terms, but only One America News Network, a MAGA-aligned outlet, publicly accepted them. Nancy A. Yusef, a veteran Pentagon correspondent for The Atlantic, called the event 'a sad day for free press' but expressed pride in her colleagues' unified stand to defend First Amendment rights. The Pentagon justified the rules as consistent with security standards already applied at other military installations. This move follows a broader context of escalating tensions between the U.S. government and the press, including former President Donald Trump's $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times and ongoing legal actions against ABC, Disney, CBS, Paramount, and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire. Despite prior reporting that journalists in the U.S. do not require Pentagon approval to publish unannounced information, the new policy has significantly restricted access for accredited reporters at the Pentagon.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 05:41 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/world/countries/pentagon-menyaet-pravila-zhurnalistov-vedushchih-smi-lishili-akkreditacii-50552944.html)\n\n**Pentagon Press Corps Rejects Reporting Pledge, Faces Credential Revocation**\nThe Pentagon Press Association (PPA), representing over 100 media outlets, has rejected a Department of Defense (DoD) policy requiring journalists to sign a pledge restricting reporting on 'unauthorized information'\u2014including classified or controlled data and statements from military personnel without prior approval. The PPA condemned the demand as unprecedented, stating no other federal agency has imposed such a requirement, and warned it would 'muzzle military personnel and threaten journalists.' Media organizations including The Washington Post, The New York Times, Reuters, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, NPR, and The Atlantic have pledged to refuse the pledge, with some threatening to return their press credentials by October 15, 2025, if the policy stands. The DoD argues the pledge is a procedural confirmation of understanding, not consent, and maintains that press access is a privilege, not a right. The policy follows broader tensions between the Trump administration and the press, including changes to White House briefing room seating, relocation of newsroom offices to conservative outlets like The New York Post and Breitbart, and public backlash over leaked military secrets via Signal. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s use of a hand-waving emoji on X (formerly Twitter) after media opposition heightened scrutiny, especially given his recent scandal over a military secret leak in a group chat. The administration has previously attacked media reports it deems inaccurate, such as those on U.S. airstrikes in Iran and troop withdrawals from South Korea.

The policy requires news organizations to obtain prior approval from the Department before publishing any material that is not already approved, and journalists who disseminate unauthorized sensitive material will have their Pentagon press credentials revoked. The Department said that revealing, accessing, or attempting to access sensitive information without authorization could result in denial or revocation of credentials. Trump said, 'No, no lo creo. Nada detiene a los periodistas' when asked about Pentagon control. The policy is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to tighten media access, following a February expulsion of four media outlets and a May order requiring official escorts for journalists. The move has been condemned by outlets such as The New York Times, Reuters, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, and by press\u2011freedom advocates. Mike Balsamo, president of the National Press Club, called it a 'direct attack' on independent journalism, saying, 'Si las noticias sobre nuestras fuerzas armadas deben ser aprobadas primero por el gobierno, entonces el p\u00fablico ya no recibe informaci\u00f3n independiente, solo lo que los funcionarios quieren que vean'. Representative Don Bacon criticized the restrictions, writing, 'Una prensa libre hace que nuestro pa\u00eds sea mejor'.

The memo states that 'news organizations will be required to acknowledge that disclosing, accessing or attempting to access sensitive information without authorisation could be grounds for having their Pentagon press credentials denied or revoked.' The memo was quickly criticised by media organisations. Reuters said, 'We are deeply concerned by the US Pentagon's newly announced restrictions on press coverage. A free and independent press is essential to American democracy, ensuring transparency and accountability. Any effort by the US government to limit journalists' ability to cover the news undermines fundamental First Amendment protections and constrains the free flow of information that is critical to informed public debate.' Thomson Reuters added, 'We remain committed to covering the Pentagon in an impartial, accurate and independent way, in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.' A New York Times spokesperson said, 'Asking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing.' The Wall Street Journal spokesperson said, 'We are deeply disturbed by this development and what it signals. We are currently evaluating its impact to our newsroom staff.' Matt Murray, Washington Post executive editor, said, 'The Constitution protects the right to report on the activities of democratically elected and appointed government officials.' The Washington Post will continue to pursue accurate, fair reporting. Trump was asked about the new policy and replied, 'No, I don't think so.

The policy, detailed in a 17\u2011page document, allows the Pentagon to cancel press passes for anyone deemed a security threat or who possesses unauthorized classified material. The Washington Post reported that the policy would require journalists covering Pentagon events to sign agreements limiting their movement in the building and forbidding possession of unapproved material. Those who refuse to sign will lose permanent credentials. The article notes that the policy marks a sharp departure from decades of practice that allowed defense leaders to speak freely to the press and to bring journalists to war zones. It also references the removal of major news outlets from Pentagon offices in February 2025, including NBC News, The New York Times, NPR, and others, and the removal of the Washington Post from its Pentagon offices.

    "summary": "The panel of forecasting experts broadly agree that while the probability of the White House formally revoking media credentials for two or more reporters from at least two media outlets before January 1, 2026, is elevated compared to historical norms\u2014primarily due to the Trump administration's extreme hostility toward the press, patterns of regulatory aggression, and recent precedent (notably at the Pentagon)\u2014the outcome remains unlikely, though not impossible, within the resolution window. \n\nMost forecasts cluster in the 16\u201343% range, with most experts citing the lack of any current credible news reports of formal White House credential revocation as defined by the question's strict fine print. The main factors increasing the chance of a 'Yes' include overt rhetorical and procedural hostility from the administration, rising precedents of credential removal in other government arenas, and the risk of last-minute escalatory events triggering a policy shift. Factors decreasing the probability focus on substantial legal constraints (as in the Acosta/CNN case), base rates showing such formal multi-outlet credential revocations are exceedingly rare in U.S. history, high potential for legal and reputational backlash, a preference for indirect access restrictions over public revocation, and the very short time remaining until the question resolves.\n\nThe highest forecast (68%) reflects the view that the administration is both willing and able to escalate further given current trends, with a non-trivial probability of a sudden, public credential revocation in response to new confrontations. Other media and legal experts give lower odds\u2014typically between 16% and 40%\u2014pointing to strong institutional inertia against formal action and a continuing pattern of using procedural restrictions rather than explicit, reportable credential pulls. Even the most pessimistic perspectives (as low as 7%) highlight the risk of Trump\u2019s unpredictability and recent access crackdowns, but emphasize legal inertia and lack of any qualifying event to date.\n\nAll experts distinguish between White House-initiated credential revocation (required by the resolution) and other forms of exclusion, such as Pentagon credential removals or access restrictions through new policies. In group chat, forecasters agreed the scenario would likely require a triggering incident or deliberate escalation but noted that so far all signals point to an environment of hostile but primarily indirect management of press access\u2014a 'soft' chilling effect rather than direct revocation.\n\nIn summary: Most experts believe a formal, multi-outlet press credential revocation at the White House before the deadline is plausible and the risk is much higher than under any recent presidency, but the absence of clear evidence, strong legal and political checks, and limited time left mean it remains somewhat less likely than not. The average forecast aggregates near 30\u201335%, with a minority of forecasters assigning substantially higher probability due to the administration's sharply escalatory trajectory.",
