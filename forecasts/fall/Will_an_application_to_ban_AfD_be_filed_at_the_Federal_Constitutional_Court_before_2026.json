German constitutional litigation is highly formalistic, precedent-bound, and risk averse, especially with an issue as momentous as a party ban. The required political majority remains out of reach given coalition splits and CDU/CSU opposition, and unresolved legal questions (pending BfV case, ongoing internal parliamentary work) make it highly unlikely an application will be filed before January 2026. In recent history, even with stronger consensus and a more isolated target (NPD), the process moved slowly and cautiously. However, the chance of a last-minute symbolic move, especially by the Bundesrat or due to sudden political pressures, is nonzero, so the forecast cannot be extremely low. A base rate for party-ban applications since WWII is less than 1 per decade, making even a 10-20% probability high historically, but current circumstances justify a modest premium above that.",

There is genuine hesitance: the government remains split, much of the CDU/CSU leadership is publicly against moving hastily, the BfV ruling\u2019s legal status is unresolved (dampening evidentiary confidence), and historical experience points to extreme caution. Yet, political momentum is at its highest to date, and there are reports of cross-party groups reaching the formal threshold for Bundestag procedural steps. An application could be filed even if its chance of ultimate success is slim; the incentive to demonstrate action before further AfD electoral strength can outweigh the downside risks, especially as the working groups wrap up. Given that the bar for this Metaculus/forecast question is only the *filing* of an application (not success), and that preparations seem close to fruition\u2014with a tactical window narrowing\u2014I assess the probability as moderately high, but not extreme.

However, crucial headwinds persist: public opinion remains deeply skeptical, and political leaders outside the SPD (notably CDU/CSU, the federal interior minister, and even some Greens/Left) have focused on the risks of a ban or advocate less direct strategies. Legal history counsels caution\u2014previous NPD bans have failed unless both anti-constitutional intent and concrete threat are proven, a hurdle still daunting for policymakers and jurists. Most critically, the ongoing legal challenge to the BfV's extremist designation reduces the immediate legal clarity needed for a ban, and time is short (three months). However, the evidence is now strong enough that a late-breaking application cannot be ruled out if the SPD pushes with its allies, possibly via Bundesrat or Bundestag. Therefore, I set the probability considerably above the historical base rate, but not above 50%.

However, unlike past years, there is now an unprecedented level of institutional preparation and rhetorical commitment among the SPD and key left-of-center elites, backed by a formal working group and classified evidence.

(2) The unresolved status of the BfV's classification means any application would risk appearing premature, legally reckless, or politically desperate, and court experience shows such mechanisms typically stall until a robust, court-proof record is assembled. (3) The recent historical base rate (in the wake of NPD and other far-right parties) for filing an application\u2014let alone when political circumstances are this fractured\u2014is extremely low; the uptick in preparatory rhetoric, while significant, does not erase the high threshold for taking the leap, given the legal, reputational, and strategic hazards of a failed or rejected application.

However, you correctly emphasize that crucial preconditions for filing are missing and not readily resolved within the final quarter of 2025: The BfV's classification remains contested and suspended, there is open CDU/CSU and some state government opposition, and\u2014crucially\u2014public resistance to a ban is both broad and regionally pronounced. Your base rate reference is well placed; even when parties have been successfully banned in Germany, consensus and situational urgency were far greater and involved much marginal parties. In sum, your 'moderate probability' stance (33\u201343%) rightfully reflects both the unprecedented nature of current developments and the gravity and inertia of legal-political status quo in Germany.

Party Systems Theory would caution not only against overreliance on public opinion or mass movement inertia to block elite-initiated actions, but also note that party bans in Germany (as rare as they are) have historically been driven by tightly networked political elites responding to perceived regime threats, sometimes with little popular enthusiasm. In this cycle, the confluence of the SPD's rapid procedural developments, the BfV's classification, and mounting social coalition activism creates a live possibility that, should the legal uncertainty clear with a favorable court ruling\u2014even late in the year\u2014a formal application may be rushed through as a dramatic gesture against further AfD gains. While your skepticism about mass mobilization being dispositive is well-placed, I suggest there\u2019s slightly more upward risk than your model indicates simply due to the velocity institutional actors have shown in the past few months when faced with escalating radical right momentum and legitimacy crises."

The review of past NPD ban attempts and the pattern of extreme caution among legal-political elites is especially instructive: historically, the Constitutional Court and initiating bodies have only advanced ban applications when conditions were both legally airtight and enjoying broad democratic legitimacy. In this case, a consensus that such bars have been cleared is still obviously lacking, and the procedural clock is running down. You also astutely allow for a minority, but non-trivial, risk of late acceleration if the legal and political environment shifts dramatically\u2014which is the correct way to weight the effects of rapidly developing news without neglecting the deep-seated norms and hurdles of German constitutional politics.

Furthermore, militant democracy doctrine specifically sanctions pre-emptive action even amid legal ambiguity if public pressure and elite consensus (within a key segment, not unanimity) demand it. The risk that a tactical/ symbolic filing, even if ultimately unsuccessful or premature, is undertaken\u2014perhaps catalyzed by the working group concluding its review or a late-year legal development\u2014is markedly higher than historic precedent, especially given SPD's public framing of a constitutional 'duty.'

Even elite-driven parties must operate within the German constitutional doctrine of 'militant democracy,' which\u2014while enabling\u2014sets formal thresholds and reputational risks that make a rushed filing difficult without at least a minimum cross-party legitimacy. The degree of CDU/CSU opposition and the unresolved court case over the BfV classification represent not just friction but structural brake mechanisms, making the gap between preparation and actual filing significant. The conditions for past party bans, as both mass mobilization and elite coordination, are not yet fully replicated\u2014even with this unprecedented working group infrastructure. In sum, your upward risk assessment is valid for monitoring but, given the time constraints and persistent opposition among institutional gatekeepers, a probability around 25% reflects a more cautious, but still elevated, appreciation of the case's exceptionalism."

My own reasoning and that of other party systems and constitutional experts align around moderately elevated but still sub-50% probabilities, emphasizing the crucial role of CDU/CSU opposition, unresolved legal ambiguity (notably the BfV designation), and strong public reluctance. However, critiques of the lowest estimates (18-25%) caution that the speed and intensity of current SPD-led elite activism, plus a rapidly evolving landscape, make a late, even dramatic, filing not entirely implausible if some key legal hurdle (especially the BfV lawsuit) is resolved.

It highlights the 2025 parliamentary elections in Moldova, where President Maia Sandu\u2019s Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) won 50.20% of the vote, with 78.5% of diaspora votes\u2014mostly in EU countries\u2014providing a decisive advantage. The opposition faced legal disqualification, mass detentions, and allegations of orchestrated suppression. Similarly, in Romania, the Constitutional Court annulled the first round of the 2024 presidential election after C\u0103lin Georgescu, a Eurosceptic candidate, led with 22.94%, citing alleged foreign interference. Georgescu was later barred from the re-run, which was won by pro-European candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan. In France, Marine Le Pen was convicted in March 2025 of embezzling EU funds, sentenced to four years (two suspended), fined \u20ac100,000, and disqualified from public office for five years\u2014effectively barring her from the 2027 presidential election. In Germany, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a 'far-right extremist' organization on 2 May 2025, based on a 1,000-page report, despite the party\u2019s rise to 20.8% of the vote and 152 seats in the Bundestag. The SPD has since initiated efforts to ban the AfD via the Federal Constitutional Court. The author contends these cases reveal a systemic pattern: when political competition threatens Brussels-aligned elites, legal mechanisms are weaponized to suppress opposition, transforming the EU\u2019s democratic facade into a 'simulacrum' of pluralism. The article concludes that the EU\u2019s institutional architecture is failing to address core challenges and is increasingly authoritarian in practice.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 08:10 PM\nSource:[The Duran](https://theduran.com/agony-of-eu-political-pluralism-how-brussels-buries-democratic-principles/)\n\n**Nationwide Coalition Mobilizes Against AfD Youth Re-Founding in Gie\u00dfen**\nA nationwide coalition named 'widersetzen' is mobilizing against the planned re-establishment of the AfD youth organization in Gie\u00dfen on November 29\u201330, 2025. The coalition, representing over 80 cities and including unions, antifascist groups, and NGOs, argues that a youth wing of the far-right AfD must not exist due to its ties to violent groups. Protest actions include road blockades of access routes to the Messe Gie\u00dfen, with only emergency vehicles permitted through. The group plans mass mobilization via buses from across Germany, aiming to surpass the 15,000 attendees and 200 buses that disrupted the AfD\u2019s 2024 party congress in Riesa. Police anticipate up to 40,000 demonstrators over two days and are preparing for multiple scenarios, though no concrete calls for violence have been reported. The coalition emphasizes non-escalation, stating it seeks only to prevent the event. The new AfD youth group, expected to be radicalized under the influence of Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, may adopt names such as 'Patriotische Jugend' or 'Junge Alternative'. H\u00f6cke, a central figure in the party\u2019s v\u00f6lkisch-nationalist wing, is highly popular among young right-wing members and has promoted radical ideas, including a controversial reference to the Hitler Youth motto. The likely new federal chairman, Jean-Pascal Hohm (28), is a Brandenburg state MP with a history of far-right affiliations and is considered a right-wing extremist by the state\u2019s constitutional protection agency. Another potential figure, Manuel Krauthausen, is a Bundestag member with a past involvement in racist online chats. Despite internal debates within the AfD about moderating the youth wing, the leadership appears unlikely to distance itself from radical elements, raising concerns that the new youth organization will continue the legacy of the banned Junge Alternative (JA), which had 2,400 members and allowed non-AfD members. The reorganization aims to integrate youth under the parent party, with automatic membership or an AfD party book required for those under a certain age.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:52 PM\nSource:[taz.de](https://taz.de/AfD-Jugend-gruendet-sich-in-Giessen-neu/!6117457/)\n\n**German Social Democrats Prepare Application to Ban 'Alternative for Germany'**\nMembers of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) are increasingly calling for the preparation of a formal application to ban the far-right party 'Alternative for Germany' (AfD). According to a joint statement from SPD parliamentary faction representatives in state parliaments and the Bundestag, as reported by dpa, such a ban is not a political attack but a necessary intervention to protect democracy, grounded in historical experience and the foundational principles of a functioning democracy. SPD policymakers justify the move by citing the AfD's increasing radicalization, spread of disinformation, support for right-wing extremist networks, and promotion of a platform that deliberately undermines core constitutional values. The 'Berlin Declaration for Democracy' calls for immediate preparation of a ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court, starting with gathering and evaluating evidence of the party's anti-constitutional activities. If the assessment indicates a viable case, there is an obligation to file the application. Only the Federal Constitutional Court can decide on banning a party, and the application must be submitted by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or federal government. In spring 2025, federal and state interior ministers agreed to establish a federal-state working group to combat the AfD, which has since been formed. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD as a confirmed right-wing extremist organization, though the party is challenging this classification in the Administrative Court of Cologne, where the classification remains temporarily suspended until the case is resolved.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 02:35 PM\nSource:[\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2025/10/2/7221563/)\n\n**SPD Legal Experts Urge AfD Ban Procedure Amid Broader Political Reforms**\nSPD legal experts are calling for the initiation of a formal procedure to ban the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, arguing that such a move is not a political attack but a necessary democratic safeguard rooted in historical experience and the principles of a resilient democracy.

The RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) calculates the average of the last ten surveys. After the 2021 Bundestag election, the SPD initially led in polls but was soon overtaken by the CDU/CSU. The Greens' post-election surge lasted longer, but they too lost support over time. The FDP also declined, ultimately failing to cross the 5% threshold in the 2025 Bundestag election. The largest beneficiary of the decline of the coalition parties (SPD, Greens, FDP) was the AfD, which rose to become the second-strongest party in polls by mid-2023. However, the AfD lost some ground in early 2024. During this period, pollsters first included the new party BSW (B\u00fcndnis Sahra Wagenknecht), which narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving just under 5% of voter support. The latest poll and results from recent federal, eastern German (Thuringia, Saxony, Brandenburg), and European elections are displayed in a graphic.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 04:03 AM\nSource:[rnd.de](https://www.rnd.de/politik/umfragen-zu-parteien-aktuelle-trends-fuer-spd-union-afd-gruene-und-co-3-10-2025-462SFUR3SNBCLN3ACXRFNANNSE.html)\n\n**Far-Right AfD Ties for First in German Poll Amid Declining Government Approval and Democratic Concerns**\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has tied with the conservative CDU/CSU coalition\u2014led by federal chancellor Friedrich Merz\u2014for first place in the Deutschlandtrend poll conducted by Infratest Dimap and broadcast by ARD, with both parties scoring 26% support. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) follows with 15%, the Greens with 12%, and The Left with 10%. The AfD gained one percentage point from the previous month, achieving its highest result ever in the Deutschlandtrend survey, while the CDU/CSU lost one point. The SPD remained unchanged, the Greens rose by one point, and The Left stayed stable. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) each scored 3%, below the 5% threshold needed to gain seats in the Bundestag. The federal government coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD) faces low approval, with 77% of voters expressing little or no satisfaction\u2014its lowest level since the government took office in May. The AfD benefits from this dissatisfaction. On the 35th anniversary of German reunification, 61% of respondents expressed satisfaction with reunification, while 34% were dissatisfied. Satisfaction was higher in western Germany (64%) than in eastern Germany (50%), where 46% were dissatisfied. The poll surveyed 1,306 German voters between September 29 and October 1, with a margin of error between 2% and 3%. Only 42% of voters are satisfied with the state of democracy in Germany, while 56% are dissatisfied\u2014especially among AfD supporters (91%). Among AfD supporters, the main perceived threats to democracy are dysfunctional political institutions (35%) and migration (16%). In contrast, supporters of other Bundestag parties identify right-wing extremism and populism as the top threat: 63% of Greens, 52% of The Left, 51% of SPD, and 39% of CDU/CSU voters cited this first. Disfunctional institutions were also seen as a major threat by traditional party supporters, though at lower rates than among AfD supporters.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 02:32 AM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/mundo/ultradireita-alcanca-1-lugar-em-pesquisa-na-alemanha)\n\n**AGONY OF EU POLITICAL PLURALISM: HOW BRUSSELS BURIES DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES**\nThe article argues that the European Union is undermining democratic principles by systematically suppressing political pluralism, particularly in post-Soviet and core EU countries. It highlights the 2025 parliamentary elections in Moldova, where President Maia Sandu\u2019s Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) won 50.20% of the vote, with 78.5% of diaspora votes\u2014mostly in EU countries\u2014providing a decisive advantage. The opposition faced legal disqualification, mass detentions, and allegations of orchestrated suppression. Similarly, in Romania, the Constitutional Court annulled the first round of the 2024 presidential election after C\u0103lin Georgescu, a Eurosceptic candidate, led with 22.94%, citing alleged foreign interference. Georgescu was later barred from the re-run, which was won by pro-European candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan. In France, Marine Le Pen was convicted in March 2025 of embezzling EU funds, sentenced to four years (two suspended), fined \u20ac100,000, and disqualified from public office for five years\u2014effectively barring her from the 2027 presidential election. In Germany, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a 'far-right extremist' organization on 2 May 2025, based on a 1,000-page report, despite the party\u2019s rise to 20.8% of the vote and 152 seats in the Bundestag. The SPD has since initiated efforts to ban the AfD via the Federal Constitutional Court. The author contends these cases reveal a systemic pattern: when political competition threatens Brussels-aligned elites, legal mechanisms are weaponized to suppress opposition, transforming the EU\u2019s democratic facade into a 'simulacrum' of pluralism. The article concludes that the EU\u2019s institutional architecture is failing to address core challenges and is increasingly authoritarian in practice.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 08:10 PM\nSource:[The Duran](https://theduran.com/agony-of-eu-political-pluralism-how-brussels-buries-democratic-principles/)\n\n**Nationwide Coalition Mobilizes Against AfD Youth Re-Founding in Gie\u00dfen**\nA nationwide coalition named 'widersetzen' is mobilizing against the planned re-establishment of the AfD youth organization in Gie\u00dfen on November 29\u201330, 2025. The coalition, representing over 80 cities and including unions, antifascist groups, and NGOs, argues that a youth wing of the far-right AfD must not exist due to its ties to violent groups. Protest actions include road blockades of access routes to the Messe Gie\u00dfen, with only emergency vehicles permitted through. The group plans mass mobilization via buses from across Germany, aiming to surpass the 15,000 attendees and 200 buses that disrupted the AfD\u2019s 2024 party congress in Riesa. Police anticipate up to 40,000 demonstrators over two days and are preparing for multiple scenarios, though no concrete calls for violence have been reported. The coalition emphasizes non-escalation, stating it seeks only to prevent the event.

The city had changed the rules in September 2025, banning federal and state-level party events from October 2025 onward, citing increased security demands and the risk of overburdening the venue.

The community was shocked upon discovering the truth, prompting public outcry and intervention from Stiftsamtfrau Eva-Maria Menard, the superior of Pastor Kautz and overall responsible for the site. Menard stated that Tute, representing a party classified by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution as right-wing extremist and anti-constitutional in its 2024 report, and deemed 'inhuman' by the Evangelical Church, violated the community\u2019s values. As a result, the Stiftskapitel demanded Tute vacate the premises and terminate his lease by August 31, 2025. The incident has sparked internal and external debates within the church about how to handle AfD members and functionaries. The Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-schlesische Oberlausitz, to which Pastor Kautz belongs, had previously, in 2024, passed a resolution at its Landessynode in G\u00f6rlitz banning AfD members from serving in parish church councils, citing the party\u2019s 'unholy alliance' with right-wing extremists who actively undermine democracy and the rule of law.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 11:09 AM\nSource:[Berliner Morgenpost](https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410139875/afd-mann-in-kloster-gemeinschaft-so-reagiert-die-leitung.html)\n\n**Geoff Russ: Geert Wilders' coming triumph and the end of Europe's mushy centrists**\nIn the Netherlands, nationalist right-wing party the Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, is poised to win the upcoming snap election, with current polls projecting it and its right-wing rival JA21 to secure nearly half the seats in parliament. This follows a rapid rise from political margins to the center of power across Europe, driven by widespread frustration over mass immigration, housing shortages, and the rising cost of living. Despite the PVV's 2023 coalition agreement collapsing, Wilders remains a dominant political figure, even as mainstream parties like the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) face their weakest electoral performance since the 1970s. In France, the National Rally (RN) has gained momentum, winning significant support from disaffected blue-collar workers and youth, though it was blocked from power in 2024 through strategic withdrawals by centrist parties. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) has become the second-largest party and now leads in polls. In the UK, Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK is gaining ground in former Labour strongholds. Across Europe, voters are rejecting traditional centrist and establishment parties, which are seen as failing to address immigration, energy costs, and stagnant wages. Energy prices in the Netherlands are projected to triple by 2040 due to reduced natural gas supply and strict environmental regulations, while housing shortages have driven rent hikes and made the country one of the most unaffordable in Europe. According to the article, the EU\u2019s political establishment has lost legitimacy due to its inability to address these issues, and the rise of nationalist parties reflects a demand for change rather than consensus. The author argues that continued attempts to block nationalist coalitions through fragile alliances only delay the inevitable shift toward populist governance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/geoff-russ-geert-wilders-coming-100010821.html)\n\n**Germany\u2019s Far\u2011Right AfD Surges in Polls Amid Calls for Ban**\nGermany\u2019s far\u2011right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has risen sharply in recent polls, now polling 30\u202f% in a June 2024 survey by Insa, up from 20.8\u202f% in the 2021 elections.

The survey found that 43% of respondents expect AfD to be the strongest party in the next election, while 39% disagree and 18% were unsure. 56% of respondents believe that AfD will increase its influence on voters before the election, and 47% think that the ruling coalition CDU/CSU should continue to refuse cooperation with AfD.

On the federal level, the party was only suspected of extremism until recently, which is considered a lower threat. AfD's leaders, Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel, called the party's recognition as a right-wing extremist organization a blow to democratic institutions.

The Social Democratic Party (SPD) continues to hover around 13% support, while the Greens and the Left party have 13% and 11% support respectively. The FDP and other parties have 3% and 6% support respectively. The poll also shows that 25% of respondents are either undecided or did not vote, a significant increase from the 17.9% who did not vote in the recent Bundestag elections. The approval rating for Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dropped to a new low, with only 29% of respondents satisfied with his work, a three-point decrease from the last poll. 'This is the worst result since his election in May. Disapproval has increased by three points to 67%', said the sociologists. The AfD was founded in 2013 as a eurosceptic party and has been known for its pro-Russian and far-right views. In May 2025, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution classified the AfD as a right-wing extremist party. Thousands of people protested against the AfD in May, calling for its ban. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, German Justice Minister Stephanie Hubig said that the party should be considered for a ban. 'The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is convinced that AfD is 'unconditionally right-wing extremist'. Therefore, we must take this party very seriously as a potential threat to our democracy. This, of course, includes considering the question of banning the party', she said.

The survey found that residents of eastern Germany are particularly opposed to the ban, with two-thirds of respondents disagreeing with it. Many respondents believe that even if the AfD is banned, a new party with similar views will quickly emerge. The survey also notes that 67% of western Germans and 88% of eastern Germans personally know someone who supports the AfD, which may reduce support for banning the party. Additionally, many believe that the parties seeking to ban the AfD are primarily motivated by a desire to eliminate a strong competitor. According to the survey, the potential support for the AfD has grown from 22% in 2023 to 33% in 2025, particularly in eastern Germany (47%). The survey was conducted from July 4 to 16, 2025, and involved 1054 participants. The potential error margin is not specified. In 2023, the German federal agency for the protection of the constitution recognized the AfD's branches in Saxony, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt as extremist. In May 2025, the agency declared the AfD extremist nationwide, allowing for increased surveillance and considered a step towards banning the party, which had previously surpassed the winning coalition of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union in several polls. The co-leaders of the AfD, Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel, called the agency's decision a blow to democracy. The AfD subsequently filed a lawsuit against the agency, which temporarily suspended the extremist designation.

The AfD has a strong base of support in eastern Germany. The survey found that the main reason for opposing the ban is the perceived bias in the media, with 67% of respondents in western Germany and 88% in eastern Germany stating that their acquaintances support the AfD. Many respondents view these acquaintances as more sympathetic than the party itself. Another reason for opposing the ban is the perception that the parties calling for it are trying to eliminate a strong competitor in the political landscape. The calls for banning the AfD have increased after the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) classified the party as 'extreme right-wing' and 'certain', allowing for greater flexibility in monitoring the party. The BfV has since suspended the classification pending a court decision on the party's appeal. It is worth noting that only the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat can request a ban on the party before the Federal Constitutional Court. The AfD, known for its anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and eurosceptic rhetoric, has been a source of tension in German politics for over a decade. In recent years, the party has gained momentum, exploiting economic discontent and growing public concerns about immigration. It is now the largest opposition party in Germany.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 19, 2025 11:32 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ar/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%B8%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%84/a-73335298)\n\n**Most Germans Oppose Ban on Alternative for Germany Party**\nA recent survey by the Allensbach Institute found that 52% of Germans oppose banning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, while 27% support the ban. The opposition to the ban is strongest in eastern Germany, where 65% of respondents are against it. The main reason for this opposition is that many Germans are familiar with AfD supporters, with 67% of western Germans and 88% of eastern Germans knowing someone who supports the party. These individuals are viewed more positively than the party itself. Another reason for the opposition is that many respondents believe that the parties pushing for the ban are simply trying to eliminate a difficult competitor in the political arena. The calls for a ban on the party have increased since the federal intelligence agency classified AfD as a 'recognized ultra-right extremist' organization, giving them more freedom to monitor the party's activities. However, this classification is currently being challenged in court by AfD. The Constitutional Court of Germany is the highest authority in deciding on any ban. AfD, known for its anti-immigration, anti-Muslim, eurosceptic, and nationalist rhetoric, has been a hot topic in German politics for over a decade. In recent years, the party has gained strength by capitalizing on economic discontent and growing public concern about immigration. Today, it is the largest opposition party in Germany.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 19, 2025 11:11 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/db34d2f0)\n\n**Germany's AfD Party Faces Growing Calls for Prohibition**\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is now the largest opposition group in Germany, is facing growing calls for its prohibition, despite being more popular than ever. The party has been classified as an extremist organization by the national intelligence agency, and a recent report by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) has exposed its racist and anti-Muslim views. The AfD has received significant support from the Trump administration, and its popularity has increased to 26% in some polls, making it briefly the most popular party in the country. However, the path to prohibiting the AfD is long and largely unprecedented. The German system of government is based on the concept of 'streitbare Demokratie' or 'militant democracy', which allows the state to defend itself against internal threats to its democratic principles and constitutional order. To prohibit a party, the Federal Constitutional Court must determine that it acts against the free democratic order, showing an aggressive and bellicose stance, and that it represents a tangible threat to democracy. The court has only prohibited two parties in the country's history, and the process is considered a measure of last resort against enemies of democracy. Some lawmakers are divided on the issue, with some fearing that prohibition could be counterproductive and fuel the sympathies of the far-right. The AfD's prohibition could have significant repercussions, including the loss of its seats in the Bundestag and the European Parliament, and a change in the majority proportion of the other parties.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 06, 2025 04:57 PM\nSource:[CNN](https://www.cnnchile.com/mundo/aumentan-llamados-a-prohibir-partido-de-extrema-derecha-en-alemania-aunque-sean-mas-populares-que-nunca_20250706/)\n\n**Calls are mounting to ban Germany's far-right AfD party - despite it being more popular than ever**\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is facing growing calls for an outright ban, despite being more popular than ever. The party has been classified as an extremist entity by Germany's domestic intelligence agency and has been accused of being racist, anti-Muslim, and devaluing entire segments of Germany's population. The center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) has voted unanimously to begin efforts to outlaw the AfD, but the legal path to banning the party is lengthy and largely unprecedented. A formal request must be made to the federal court, which would then decide whether to begin proceedings or throw out the application. If the AfD were to be banned, its sitting lawmakers would receive an automatic loss of mandate, and its seats in the Bundestag and European Parliament would remain vacant. The German Federal Constitutional Court has only banned two parties in the country's history, and experts believe that imposing a ban on the AfD would be difficult and could have significant reverberations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 06, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/calls-mounting-ban-germany-far-040024225.html)\n\n**SPD Seeks to Ban AfD Party Over 'Threat to Democracy'**\nThe Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) wants to ban the 'Alternative for Germany' (AfD) party, which advocates for the renewal of mutually beneficial trade and economic relations with Russia. The SPD adopted a special resolution at its national congress, calling on the parliament and government to initiate the procedure for recognizing AfD as unconstitutional as soon as possible. The resolution states: 'With a party that abuses democratic principles to fight democracy from within, fair competition is impossible. Any attempt to include them in the democratic discourse will lead to nothing. It is now time for competent constitutional bodies to create conditions for an immediate statement on the submission of an application for the unconstitutionality of AfD.' EADaily notes that two months ago, the German counter-intelligence agency declared AfD an 'extremist organization', assessing it as a 'threat to democracy'. So far, this status has only been applied to the party's regional structures in Thuringia, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. The entire party was simply classified as 'suspected of extremism'. In response, AfD filed a lawsuit against the counter-intelligence agency and accused the outgoing federal government of conducting a 'politically motivated smear campaign'. However, many German politicians have noted that the attempt to ban AfD may only strengthen it and bring it more support. Experts also point to the uncertain outcome of a possible court hearing, citing a recent decision by the Federal Administrative Court of Germany, which overturned the ban on the 'Compact' magazine associated with AfD.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 30, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[EADaily](https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2025/06/30/sdpg-hochet-zapretit-partiyu-alternativa-dlya-germanii)\n\n**German Social Democrats Plan to Ban Far-Right AfD Party**\nThe German Social Democratic Party plans to move forward with efforts to ban the far-right 'Alternative for Germany' (AfD) party. A proposal to be voted on today at the party's annual conference in Berlin calls on constitutional bodies to pave the way for a lawsuit to declare the AfD party unconstitutional due to its anti-immigration stance. The proposal states, 'It is time for the constitutional bodies to prepare the ground for a swift request to the Federal Constitutional Court to declare the AfD party unconstitutional.' The party's leader, Berlina Pas, expressed her support for the proposal, saying, 'We must now clarify whether there are sufficient grounds to submit a proposal to the Federal Constitutional Court to declare the AfD party unconstitutional.' She added that if such evidence is found, 'as a social democratic party, we have a democratic duty to do our utmost to ensure that a proposal to ban the party can be submitted.' The AfD party has been known for its anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric, as well as its skepticism towards the European Union and its advocacy for nationalism. The party has gained momentum in recent years by exploiting economic discontent and growing concerns about immigration. It is now the largest opposition party in Germany. Calls for banning the AfD party have increased after the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution reclassified the party as a 'right-wing extremist group' in May, allowing for expanded surveillance. However, the office has since decided to suspend this classification pending a court review, and will treat the party as a 'suspected right-wing extremist group' until a court ruling is made.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 06:48 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=29062025&id=5434e9a0-8592-47e2-be8c-15a15858740d)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a range of legal, political science, and sociological perspectives, expert forecasts on whether an application to ban the AfD will be filed at the German Federal Constitutional Court before 2026 converge on a scenario where elevated momentum and formal preparations are present, but significant legal, institutional, and public opinion barriers make actual filing less likely than not. Nearly all experts highlight the unprecedented level of SPD (and some partner) organization: formal working groups, parliamentary resolutions, and intensified rhetoric calling for action, amplified by the BfV\u2019s 2025 classification of the AfD as 'extremist' (though this classification is currently suspended pending court review).\n\nThe strongest downward pressures are shared across forecasts: the extremely high legal bar and caution from prior failed party ban attempts (notably the NPD cases); unresolved legal challenges to the BfV classification (weakening the evidence for a ban); lack of elite consensus\u2014particularly reluctance or opposition from CDU/CSU and some federal government figures; and strong public resistance, especially in eastern Germany, to an AfD ban. Political risk\u2014of energizing the AfD or provoking backlash\u2014intensifies caution.\n\nUpward pressures stem from the undeniable increase in technical preparation, a shift from rhetorical posturing to active review, external/societal pressure (social movements), and the potential for sudden escalation due to incidents or legal breakthroughs. Some experts note that the bar for filing (the question\u2019s criteria) is lower than for winning a ban, allowing for a symbolic or even doomed application if the political context shifts suddenly.\n\nProbabilities assigned by the experts range from 18% to 62%, with most clustering between 18% and 38%. Only one expert (from a legal practice in Germany focused on political party ban process) assesses the probability above even (62%), stressing that the filing bar is lower than the success bar and that late-stage momentum could tip the balance. All others regard a filing as plausible but not more likely than not. Typical descriptions of a 'No' scenario revolve around continued preparation and debate, with no cross-institutional consensus or the legal underpinnings deemed too fragile to proceed in the remaining three months. A 'Yes' scenario generally involves last-minute political mobilization, completion of evidence review (possibly due to a legal breakthrough or external scandal), and a push through by SPD and allies, possibly leveraging the Bundesrat.\n\nIn summary, experts widely agree that, while conditions are riper for such a filing than in any previous German postwar moment, the combination of legal, political, and societal headwinds still makes a formal ban application before 2026 less likely than not. The consensus forecast centers around a 20\u201340% chance of an application, with outlier higher optimism only on the contingent scenario of fast-moving political will.",
