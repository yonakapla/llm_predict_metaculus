The only plausible Yes path is an ultra-limited, quiet restart in a very friendly regulatory environment. This is not impossible, given some AV-friendly states, but remains highly unlikely due to the organizational timeframes for recovery and the absence of indications of an imminent relaunch targeting the general public (and not a closed beta). Given all factors\u2014especially the historical rates, regulatory chills post-Waymo/Tesla incidents, and the lack of any public pilot in December 2025\u2014I assess the probability that Cruise will operate a general-public, rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the U.S. on January 1, 2026, as extremely low, but short of zero (allowing for black swan city-level exceptions).",

The historical base rate for returning to full public service post-suspension (much slower than a year) further reinforces this. No recent news or regulatory filings suggest Cruise has cleared the hurdles needed to launch anywhere in the U.S. Even the theoretical possibility of a quiet launch in a permissive state is highly remote, and this would likely have generated at least some industry or regulatory reporting.

The fact that even Waymo, which has a far stronger regulatory and operational track record, is facing expanding investigations but is not shut down, speaks both to a preference for incremental correction where possible, but also to just how much steeper Cruise\u2019s climb would be.

In late October 2023, Cruise [suspended](https://apnews.com/article/cruise-robotaxi-suspends-operations-gm-73f27ef959afe1e201e61f0fd31802d5) all driverless operations nationwide after California regulators ordered the company to remove its driverless cars from state roads, citing safety concerns and accusing Cruise of misrepresenting the technology's capabilities.\n\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles [stated](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-statement-on-cruise-llc-suspension/) that Cruise's driverless vehicles posed \"an unreasonable risk to public safety\" and that the company had provided misleading information about the safety of its self-driving system. This move by regulators came after a series of incidents involving Cruise vehicles, including crashes caused by the vehicles' abrupt braking.\n\nAdditionally, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) [is investigating](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/cruise-under-nhtsa-probe-into-autonomous-driving-pedestrian-injuries.html) multiple reports of Cruise self-driving cars engaging in inappropriately hard braking, resulting in collisions.

The NHTSA issued a letter dated December 3, 2025, announcing the probe into the performance of Waymo's autonomous vehicles and their compliance with traffic safety laws, including the requirement to stop for school buses with flashing red lights and deployed stop arms. The Austin Independent School District reported 20 such incidents during the current school year, with the 20th citation issued as of December 1, 2025, despite Waymo claiming to have fixed the software issue through updates implemented on November 17. The school district requested that Waymo suspend operations during student loading and unloading hours, but the company refused. Waymo\u2019s chief safety officer, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, confirmed the company is planning a voluntary software recall with the NHTSA next week and stated the company will continue analyzing and improving vehicle performance. In response to the probe, Waymo emphasized its overall safety record, citing a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers and twelve times fewer pedestrian injury crashes. The investigation follows a prior incident in Atlanta, Georgia, in October 2025, where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus without a safety operator present. Atlanta Public Schools reported six similar incidents in their district. Waymo, owned by Alphabet, launched its public autonomous ride service in Phoenix in October 2020 and now operates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix, and Atlanta, with plans to expand to Philadelphia and over two dozen other cities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 06, 2025 12:46 AM\nSource:[Aol](https://www.aol.com/articles/officials-expand-probe-waymo-over-191348129.html)\n\n**Waymo to Voluntarily File Software Recall Over Robotaxi Behavior Around School Buses**\nWaymo plans to voluntarily file a software recall with U.S. federal safety regulators regarding how its robotaxis operate around school buses. The recall will be filed early next week, following increased scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and criticism from authorities in Atlanta and Austin. The NHTSA\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an initial probe in October after reviewing footage of a Waymo autonomous vehicle crossing perpendicularly in front of a stopped school bus with its stop sign extended and flashing lights in Atlanta. The vehicle then turned left in front of the bus before proceeding down the street. Similar incidents occurred in Austin, where Waymo operates a robotaxi service in partnership with Uber. Waymo stated that it identified the issue and updated its software on November 17. The company claims the update significantly improved performance, now exceeding human driver performance in this critical scenario. In a statement, Waymo\u2019s Director of Safety, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, said, 'Although we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record\u2014showing Waymo has 12 times fewer injury-involved accidents with pedestrians than human drivers\u2014maintaining the highest safety standards means acknowledging when our behavior should be better.' The company emphasized that no injuries were linked to the behavior under recall and reiterated that safety remains its top priority. Waymo will continue analyzing performance and implementing necessary updates as part of its commitment to continuous improvement. Software recalls have become increasingly common in the era of modern passenger vehicles and robotaxis, where operations are software-driven. While updates are often deployed before official recall, formal filing with federal authorities carries regulatory weight. This marks Waymo\u2019s second voluntary software recall in 2024, following a prior recall after a Waymo vehicle in Phoenix collided with a telephone pole during a low-speed maneuver in a narrow alley, operating without a human safety operator.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 08:14 PM\nSource:[boainformacao.com.br](https://boainformacao.com.br/2025/12/waymo-emitira-recall-de-software-sobre-como-os-robotaxis-se-comportam-em-torno-de-onibus-escolares/)\n\n**Feds ask Waymo about robotaxis repeatedly passing school buses in Austin | TechCrunch**\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has requested detailed information from Waymo regarding its fifth-generation self-driving system and operations after the Austin Independent School District (Austin ISD) reported 19 instances of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing stopped school buses during the 2025\u201326 school year. This follows an initial investigation opened in October 2025 after footage showed a Waymo vehicle crossing in front of a stopped Atlanta school bus with flashing lights and extended stop sign. Waymo claimed the bus partially blocked the driveway and obscured visibility, and stated it issued a software update on November 17 to improve performance. However, Austin ISD reported at least five violations occurred after the update. In a November 20 letter, the district demanded Waymo cease operations during peak student arrival and departure times\u20145:20 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.\u2014until compliance with traffic laws is assured. The NHTSA\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) sent a follow-up letter on December 4, 2025, asking whether Waymo had halted operations per the district\u2019s request, whether the software update resolved the issue, and whether a recall was planned. Waymo maintains that safety is its top priority, citing a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes and twelvefold fewer pedestrian injury crashes compared to human drivers, and reaffirmed its commitment to continuous improvement and collaboration with regulators.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 10:54 PM\nSource:[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/feds-ask-waymo-about-robotaxis-repeatedly-passing-school-buses-in-austin/)\n\n**U.S. expands investigation into Waymo over robotaxis driving around stopped school buses**\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has expanded its investigation into Waymo, focusing on its autonomous vehicles' compliance with traffic laws after reports that Waymo robotaxis illegally passed stopped school buses in Austin, Texas.

The NHTSA issued a letter dated December 3, 2025, announcing the probe into the performance of Waymo's autonomous vehicles and their compliance with traffic safety laws, including the requirement to stop for school buses with flashing red lights and deployed stop arms. The Austin Independent School District reported 20 such incidents during the current school year, with the 20th citation issued as of December 1, 2025, despite Waymo claiming to have fixed the software issue through updates implemented on November 17. The school district requested that Waymo suspend operations during student loading and unloading hours, but the company refused. Waymo\u2019s chief safety officer, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, confirmed the company is planning a voluntary software recall with the NHTSA next week and stated the company will continue analyzing and improving vehicle performance. In response to the probe, Waymo emphasized its overall safety record, citing a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers and twelve times fewer pedestrian injury crashes. The investigation follows a prior incident in Atlanta, Georgia, in October 2025, where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus without a safety operator present. Atlanta Public Schools reported six similar incidents in their district. Waymo, owned by Alphabet, launched its public autonomous ride service in Phoenix in October 2020 and now operates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix, and Atlanta, with plans to expand to Philadelphia and over two dozen other cities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 06, 2025 12:46 AM\nSource:[Aol](https://www.aol.com/articles/officials-expand-probe-waymo-over-191348129.html)\n\n**Waymo to Voluntarily File Software Recall Over Robotaxi Behavior Around School Buses**\nWaymo plans to voluntarily file a software recall with U.S. federal safety regulators regarding how its robotaxis operate around school buses. The recall will be filed early next week, following increased scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and criticism from authorities in Atlanta and Austin. The NHTSA\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an initial probe in October after reviewing footage of a Waymo autonomous vehicle crossing perpendicularly in front of a stopped school bus with its stop sign extended and flashing lights in Atlanta. The vehicle then turned left in front of the bus before proceeding down the street. Similar incidents occurred in Austin, where Waymo operates a robotaxi service in partnership with Uber. Waymo stated that it identified the issue and updated its software on November 17. The company claims the update significantly improved performance, now exceeding human driver performance in this critical scenario. In a statement, Waymo\u2019s Director of Safety, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, said, 'Although we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record\u2014showing Waymo has 12 times fewer injury-involved accidents with pedestrians than human drivers\u2014maintaining the highest safety standards means acknowledging when our behavior should be better.' The company emphasized that no injuries were linked to the behavior under recall and reiterated that safety remains its top priority. Waymo will continue analyzing performance and implementing necessary updates as part of its commitment to continuous improvement. Software recalls have become increasingly common in the era of modern passenger vehicles and robotaxis, where operations are software-driven. While updates are often deployed before official recall, formal filing with federal authorities carries regulatory weight. This marks Waymo\u2019s second voluntary software recall in 2024, following a prior recall after a Waymo vehicle in Phoenix collided with a telephone pole during a low-speed maneuver in a narrow alley, operating without a human safety operator.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 08:14 PM\nSource:[boainformacao.com.br](https://boainformacao.com.br/2025/12/waymo-emitira-recall-de-software-sobre-como-os-robotaxis-se-comportam-em-torno-de-onibus-escolares/)\n\n**Waymo investigation could stop autonomous driving in its tracks**\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a new investigation into Waymo following repeated safety violations involving its autonomous vehicles failing to stop for school buses in Austin, Texas. According to the Austin Independent School District (ISD), Waymo vehicles violated school bus stop signs 19 times during the current school year, with incidents occurring approximately 1.5 times per week. A video released by Austin ISD on December 1, 2025, documented all 19 violations, including a November 12 incident where a Waymo vehicle turned left in front of children crossing the street as a school bus\u2019s stop sign was deployed. Despite Waymo claiming software updates were issued to fix the issue, Austin ISD reported ongoing violations in a November 20, 2025, letter. The NHTSA had previously opened a Preliminary Evaluation in October 2025 after a Georgia media report showed similar violations. The agency stated, 'ODI is concerned that ADS-equipped vehicles exhibiting such unexpected driving behaviors or not complying with traffic safety laws concerning school buses may increase the risk of crash, injury, and property damage.' This follows a prior incident involving Tesla Robotaxi, where a video showed an autonomous Tesla ignoring a school bus stop sign and striking a child dummy in a simulation. Waymo, founded in 2009 and spun off from Alphabet in 2016, operates its Waymo One service 24/7 in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area, with over 1,500 vehicles as of July 2025 and plans to add 2,000 more by 2026. The company's vehicles are classified as Level 4 autonomous systems, meaning they can operate without human intervention under specific conditions. However, the Austin incidents raise serious concerns about the safety and reliability of such systems, particularly in high-risk environments like school zones.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 08:07 PM\nSource:[TheStreet](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/waymo-investigation-could-stop-autonomous-driving-in-its-tracks)\n\n**Tesla's FSD Controversy: Musk's Message-Posting Claim Sparks Legal and Safety Concerns**\nElon Musk announced that the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software now allows users to send messages while driving. However, this feature is illegal in most U.S. states and can result in license suspension. Musk claims the system is advanced enough to permit such distractions 'depending on traffic context,' but Tesla has provided no further clarification and lacks a press office to address inquiries. FSD is not a fully autonomous system and requires continuous driver supervision. Previously, Tesla removed the requirement to keep hands on the wheel, replacing it with a camera-based monitoring system, but the driver remains responsible for attention. This ambiguity has contributed to documented incidents involving incorrect handoffs between human and software, including unauthorized red-light crossings, incorrect lane changes, and collisions in low-visibility conditions. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating multiple FSD-related incidents. Additionally, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has been in a prolonged legal dispute with Tesla, accusing the company of promoting autonomous driving capabilities unsupported by technical evidence. The DMV has even requested a temporary halt to Tesla's sales and production in California, with a decision expected by year-end. Musk\u2019s statement risks increasing public confusion by implying FSD is more reliable than official data suggests. Authorities emphasize that using a mobile phone while driving remains illegal regardless of vehicle automation level. The tension between Tesla\u2019s claims and regulatory reality is expected to intensify as public debate continues over innovation, safety, and accountability.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 12:16 PM\nSource:[Lega Nerd](https://leganerd.com/2025/12/05/tesla-la-sparata-di-musk-ora-potete-messaggiare-alla-guida-peccato-che-sia-illegale/)\n\n**US investigating Waymo after footage captures self-driving cars illegally moving past school buses in Texas**\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an investigation into Waymo following video evidence from the Austin Independent School District (AISD) showing Waymo autonomous vehicles driving past stopped school buses with flashing red lights and deployed stop arms in Austin, Texas, as of 2025. Footage captured at least 19 incidents since the school year began, including one on December 1, 2025, where a Waymo vehicle passed a bus with students loading, despite the bus having been stopped for nearly a full minute. AISD Chief of Police Wayne Sneed stated that Waymo has refused to halt operations despite repeated requests and that the company reported software updates in mid-November, yet violations persisted. NHTSA cited concerns that non-compliance with school bus safety laws may increase the risk of crashes, injuries, and property damage. Waymo confirmed it implemented software updates by November 17, claiming the changes significantly improved performance, even surpassing human driver safety in some cases, and emphasized its commitment to road safety. The investigation coincides with Waymo\u2019s reported plans to expand its self-driving service to Dallas in 2026, following ongoing road testing in the city.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 03:07 AM\nSource:[Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/us-investigating-waymo-footage-captures-self-driving-cars-illegally-moving-past-texas-school-buses)\n\n**Waymo Under Scrutiny: Robotaxis Pass School Buses Illegally in Austin**\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requested detailed information from Waymo regarding its autonomous driving system after the Austin Independent School District reported 19 incidents in which Waymo's robotaxis illegally passed school buses during the 2025-26 school year. The NHTSA had already opened an investigation two months prior, following an incident in Atlanta in October where a Waymo autonomous vehicle crossed perpendicularly in front of a stopped school bus displaying its hazard lights and stop sign. Waymo claimed the bus partially blocked the lane and that the vehicle\u2019s sensors failed to detect the stop sign and flashing lights. Despite implementing a software update on November 17, the Austin district reported at least five incidents occurred afterward. In a November 20 letter, the district stated: 'Waymo\u2019s software updates clearly are not working as expected or fast enough. We cannot allow Waymo to continue endangering our students while it attempts to implement a solution.' The NHTSA, after receiving the district\u2019s alert, sent a letter to Waymo four days later asking whether operations had been suspended as requested, whether the software update mitigated concerns, and whether Waymo had plans for a market withdrawal. Waymo, in a statement, reaffirmed safety as its top priority, citing a fivefold reduction in injury-causing accidents and a 12-fold reduction in pedestrian-involved accidents compared to human drivers.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 01:06 AM\nSource:[Cadena 3 Argentina](https://www.cadena3.com/noticia/tecnologia/waymo-bajo-la-lupa-robotaxis-pasan-ilegalmente-buses-escolares-en-austin_494363)\n\n**Feds ask Waymo about robotaxis repeatedly passing school buses in Austin | TechCrunch**\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has requested detailed information from Waymo regarding its fifth-generation self-driving system and operations after the Austin Independent School District (Austin ISD) reported 19 instances of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing stopped school buses during the 2025\u201326 school year. This follows an initial investigation opened in October 2025 after footage showed a Waymo vehicle crossing in front of a stopped Atlanta school bus with flashing lights and extended stop sign. Waymo claimed the bus partially blocked the driveway and obscured visibility, and stated it issued a software update on November 17 to improve performance. However, Austin ISD reported at least five violations occurred after the update. In a November 20 letter, the district demanded Waymo cease operations during peak student arrival and departure times\u20145:20 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.\u2014until compliance with traffic laws is assured. The NHTSA\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) sent a follow-up letter on December 4, 2025, asking whether Waymo had halted operations per the district\u2019s request, whether the software update resolved the issue, and whether a recall was planned.

The investigation, initiated in October following an incident in Georgia where a Waymo vehicle failed to stop at a school bus with flashing lights and extended stop arm, has intensified due to new evidence. On November 20, the independent Austin school district reported five incidents in November alone, despite Waymo claiming to have implemented software updates to resolve the issue. The district\u2019s attorney stated that Waymo\u2019s continued operation during school drop-off and pick-up times poses a risk to students, citing a specific incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus just seconds after a student had begun crossing the road and was still on the roadway. On November 24, the NHTSA formally asked Waymo whether it would suspend autonomous operations near schools during these times, and whether a suitable software fix had been developed or if a recall of the update was planned. The Austin school district confirmed on December 4 that Waymo has refused to halt operations and reported a new incident on December 1, when a self-driving vehicle overtook a school bus while students were boarding or exiting\u2014indicating that the software changes have not resolved the safety concerns. Waymo stated in a response that it remains committed to safe interactions with school buses, has deployed immediate software updates, and will continue to make rapid improvements, but did not address why it has not suspended operations or whether a recall is planned. The NHTSA has now demanded that Waymo respond by January 20, 2026, with detailed information on the incidents and the technical measures taken to address the safety issues.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/us-behoerden-untersuchen-berichte-ueber-19-illegale-ueberholmanoever-von-waymo-robotaxis-an-schulbussen-ce7d51dfd18ff526)\n\n**US probes Alphabet unit Waymo robotaxis over school bus safety**\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a preliminary investigation into approximately 2,000 Waymo self-driving vehicles following reports that the company's robotaxis may have failed to comply with traffic safety laws when approaching a stopped school bus. The probe was triggered by a media report featuring video from Georgia showing a Waymo vehicle stopping initially but then maneuvering around a school bus with flashing red lights and a deployed stop arm while students were disembarking. NHTSA stated that, based on its engagement with Waymo and the company\u2019s accumulation of over 100 million miles of autonomous driving\u2014now at 2 million miles per week\u2014the likelihood of similar prior incidents is high. The vehicle involved was equipped with Waymo\u2019s fifth-generation Automated Driving System and operated without a human safety driver. Waymo acknowledged the incident, saying it had already implemented software improvements related to school bus stops and would roll out additional updates in its next release. The company emphasized that 'driving safely around children has always been one of Waymo's highest priorities' and explained that the vehicle approached the bus from an angle where the lights and stop arm were not visible, drove slowly around the front, and maintained a safe distance from children. Waymo operates more than 1,500 robotaxis across major U.S. cities including Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin. This investigation follows NHTSA\u2019s closure of a 14-month probe in July 2025 into 22 reports of minor collisions and 'unexpected behavior' from Waymo vehicles, which involved driving in ways that potentially violated traffic laws; that probe ended after two recalls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 10:21 AM\nSource:[CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/us-probes-alphabet-unit-waymo-robotaxis-over-school-bus-safety-5412986)\n\n**Tesla's self-driving cars under fire again**\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a new investigation into 2.88 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the 'Full Self-Driving' (FSD) software, citing concerns that the system may be violating traffic laws and contributing to accidents. According to Reuters, 58 incident reports detail FSD vehicles running red lights, drifting into wrong lanes, and crashing at intersections\u201414 of which involved crashes and 23 caused injuries. One Houston driver reported that the FSD system failed to recognize traffic signals, stopping at green lights but running reds, and claimed Tesla acknowledged the issue during a test drive but refused to fix it. The NHTSA is also reviewing cases where FSD failed to safely navigate railroad crossings, including a near-collision with an oncoming train. This is not Tesla\u2019s first regulatory scrutiny: the company faces multiple investigations into Autopilot and FSD, including a California jury awarding $329 million in a lawsuit over an Autopilot-related fatality, and an ongoing probe into its limited Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, where passengers reported erratic driving and speeding even with human safety drivers present. Additionally, Tesla is battling a false advertising lawsuit from California\u2019s DMV over the term 'Full Self-Driving,' which regulators argue is misleading since the system requires constant driver supervision. Tesla recently rebranded the software to 'Full Self-Driving (Supervised)' to reflect this. The latest FSD update was released just days before the investigation began, but the NHTSA asserts the system has already 'induced vehicle behavior that violated traffic safety laws.' The investigation is in its early stages and could result in a recall if safety risks are confirmed. The NHTSA emphasizes that 'self-driving' does not mean fully autonomous, and drivers must remain vigilant. This growing regulatory scrutiny underscores the challenges Tesla faces in building public trust in AI-driven transportation, even as the push toward automation continues under increased oversight.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/teslas-self-driving-cars-under-fire-again)\n\n**U.S. to Investigate Nearly 2.88 Million Tesla Vehicles with 'Full Self-Driving' Feature**\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced an investigation into approximately 288,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the 'Full Self-Driving' (FSD) system, following over 50 reports of traffic safety violations and multiple accident incidents. The agency found that Tesla FSD-equipped vehicles have engaged in behaviors violating traffic laws, including running red lights and improper lane changes. A total of 58 reports have been reviewed, including 14 accidents resulting in 23 injuries. Six of these accidents involved vehicles using FSD systems that entered intersections at red lights and collided with other vehicles, with four causing injuries. Complaints also allege the system failed to accurately detect traffic signals or stop completely at red lights, though Tesla has not acknowledged or resolved these issues. The investigation is currently in a preliminary assessment phase; if an 'unreasonable safety risk' is identified, a recall may be mandated. Tesla has not issued a public response but has updated its software. The NHTSA will also examine the system's performance near railway crossings. This follows a push from Democratic senators to investigate near-miss collisions linked to the FSD system. In September 2025, the agency launched a preliminary probe into electronic door handle failures affecting approximately 174,300 U.S.-market Tesla Model Y vehicles. In June 2025, Tesla's Robotaxi vehicles in Austin, Texas, were under investigation for alleged traffic law violations during public road tests, including speeding and improper lane changes. Since 2025, the NHTSA has held multiple meetings with Tesla regarding accidents involving the Autopilot and FSD systems, including one incident where the system misidentified a fire truck and caused a collision. The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating whether Tesla misled consumers in its advertising of autonomous driving features. According to Tesla's official website, the FSD system is designed to perform intelligent driving tasks\u2014such as route navigation, steering, lane changes, and parking\u2014under driver supervision, but it is not yet capable of full autonomy. Meanwhile, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has approved Tesla to roll out software updates to enhance its autonomous driving features via over-the-air updates. Tesla Japan has already begun testing the FSD technology on public roads, with tests conducted by Tesla Japan employees. The company plans to officially launch the FSD software to consumers once safety standards and regulatory requirements are met. A former Tesla board member recently stated on social media platform X that Japan\u2019s decision is significant and could pave the way for the wider adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems among Tesla users in Japan.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 09:36 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202510143532715659.html)\n\n**Elon Musk vs. the regulators | TechCrunch**\nElon Musk's companies face heightened regulatory scrutiny in October 2025. The Boring Company is accused of nearly 800 violations in Nevada, including unauthorized digging, improper water disposal, failure to install silt fences, and dirt tracking onto roads, according to a ProPublica investigation. Tesla faces enforcement action from California's Department of Insurance for routinely denying or delaying customer claims, despite prior warnings. Additionally, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has reopened an investigation into Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, specifically targeting incidents where vehicles ran red lights or entered wrong lanes. This investigation is notable as FSD is central to Tesla\u2019s vision for autonomous vehicles and robotaxis, with the latest version (v14) recently rolled out. Meanwhile, General Motors is reportedly rebuilding its autonomous vehicle (AV) team in Austin and Mountain View, rehiring former Cruise employees, and developing new driver-assistance technology using repurposed Chevy Bolts. Joby Aviation raised $514 million by selling 30.5 million shares at $16.85 each\u201411% below the prior close\u2014funding certification, manufacturing, and commercial operations, with passenger flights planned in Dubai by 2026 and in the U.S. soon after. Other developments include Futurail raising \u20ac7.5 million for self-driving train autonomy, Nexcade securing $2.5 million for freight automation, DoorDash partnering with Serve Robotics for nationwide autonomous deliveries, Lucid achieving a record EV delivery quarter, and Lyft teaming up with Tensor Auto to deploy robotaxis in Europe and North America starting in 2027. Tesla also launched stripped-down Model 3 and Model Y variants starting at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively, without Autopilot\u2014marking a departure from innovation and raising questions about pricing strategy.

The probe focuses on 58 reported traffic safety violations, including 14 incidents that resulted in crashes or fires. Specifically, 18 complaints and one media report allege that FSD-equipped vehicles failed to stop fully at red lights or remained stopped for insufficient durations. Six Standing General Order reports detail vehicles proceeding through red lights and crashing into other vehicles, with four such incidents occurring at the same intersection in Maryland\u2014where Tesla has since adjusted FSD programming in cooperation with Maryland State Police. Additional complaints\u201418 and two media reports\u2014describe dangerous maneuvers such as entering opposing lanes during turns, crossing double yellow lines, turning the wrong way on one-way streets, continuing straight in turn-only lanes, and turning from through lanes. A key concern is the lack of warnings to drivers before these unexpected behaviors occur. The Office of Defects Investigation will assess whether drivers received adequate warnings, sufficient time to respond, and whether FSD can properly detect traffic signals, lane markings, and wrong-way signage. Railroad crossings are also under scrutiny, with Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) urging NHTSA to restrict FSD to its designed road and weather conditions and to rename the system to avoid misleading drivers. This is the second major NHTSA investigation into FSD, following a 2024 probe of 2.4 million vehicles.

They emphasized that such errors pose a far greater risk than typical violations like missing traffic signs or improper lane changes. Tesla has not responded to requests for comment. NHTSA confirmed it received the letter and is collecting incident data, noting that while the FSD system can assist with steering, braking, and acceleration in certain conditions, drivers must remain in control at all times. The FSD system, more advanced than the earlier Autopilot, has long been under regulatory scrutiny. In October 2024, NHTSA launched an investigation into 2.4 million FSD-equipped vehicles following four collision reports under limited visibility, including a fatal accident in 2023. The senators urged NHTSA to consider restricting FSD to operate only under its designed road and weather conditions. Beyond FSD, other Tesla automation features are also under review: in January 2025, NHTSA initiated a probe into 2.6 million vehicles with remote mobile capabilities. Additionally, NHTSA is examining Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi service, launched in Austin, Texas, in June 2025, after sending a letter on July 1 asking whether Tesla allows employees to remotely control vehicles in operation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 07:59 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8n62UB7ZvMl)\n\n**Can driverless cars get tickets? What happened when Bay Area police pulled over a Waymo**\nThe San Bruno Police Department posted on social media that on a Saturday officers were patrolling for drunk drivers when they saw a Waymo robotaxi make an illegal U\u2011turn at a traffic light.  Because the vehicle had no human driver, the officers could not issue a ticket and instead notified Waymo of a \u2018glitch.\u2019  The department wrote, \u2018It was a first for both officers,\u2019 and added, \u2018Hopefully the reprogramming will keep it from making any more illegal moves.\u2019  The incident illustrates a gap in California law: traffic tickets can only be issued to an actual driver, so autonomous vehicles cannot be penalized in the same way.  California lawmakers are addressing this loophole with Assembly Bill 1777, which will take effect in July and allows law\u2011enforcement agencies to report autonomous\u2011vehicle noncompliance to the Department of Motor Vehicles.  The bill\u2019s original version would have permitted citations to self\u2011driving cars, but it was watered down with amendments.  Waymo spokesperson Julia Ilina said the company\u2019s vehicles are subject to close oversight by California regulators and that the autonomous system is designed to respect the rules of the road.  She added, \u2018We are looking into this situation and are committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience.\u2019  Critics, including the Teamsters union, argue the law is not strong enough and has been described as taking California \u2018backward.\u2019  The union has called for more oversight, such as mandating human operators for autonomous heavy\u2011duty trucks.  California\u2019s approach is less strict than Arizona or Texas, which allow officers to issue citations to the registered owner of a vehicle even when no human is present.  The article also notes safety concerns that have arisen in the industry, citing a 2023 incident in which a pedestrian was seriously injured by a Cruise vehicle and a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probe into Tesla\u2019s autonomous technology after four collisions, including one fatality.  Waymo claims its driverless vehicles are safer, reporting that in the four cities it operates, the cars have 79\u202f% fewer air\u2011bag\u2011deployment crashes and 80\u202f% fewer injury\u2011causing crashes than traditional vehicles over the same distance, as of June\u202f2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 10:03 AM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2025-09-30/can-driverless-cars-get-tickets-what-happened-when-bay-area-police-pulled-over-a-waymo)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014covering autonomous vehicle technology, urban mobility planning, U.S. regulatory and legal compliance, and business strategy\u2014there is overwhelming consensus that Cruise is highly unlikely to operate a rider-only, general-public ride-hailing service anywhere in the U.S. on January 1, 2026. Every expert highlights the severe impact of Cruise's October 2023 nationwide suspension following safety incidents and regulatory findings of misrepresentation, which has resulted in a loss of regulatory and public trust that historically takes well over a year to rehabilitate. Multiple factors converge to reduce the probability almost to zero: ongoing NHTSA and state investigations, tighter regulatory scrutiny of AVs (with even leading operators like Waymo and Tesla under heightened investigation), absence of credible reports or signals of an imminent relaunch or regulatory approval, internal restructuring and resource depletion at Cruise/GM, and the extremely strict fine print that requires public, rider-only service\u2014not closed pilots or waitlist-based access. Although a few experts consider a tail-risk scenario in which Cruise quietly launches a limited service in a permissive jurisdiction (such as Texas or Arizona), all agree that even this would likely have generated some regulatory or media coverage by late 2025 if it were impending. Probability estimates from all experts range from 1% to 4%, with final reasoning citing consistent historical base rates, lack of any public signs of resumption, and an increasingly risk-averse regulatory climate across the sector. No expert provides a scenario in which recent developments or business strategies credibly support a rapid return, and all point out that a launch meeting resolution criteria would almost certainly have been reported. In sum, the expert consensus is that a 'No' outcome is extremely probable, with all available evidence and sector precedent strongly aligned against a resumption of Cruise\u2019s rider-only, general-public service by January 1, 2026.",
