The forecast also correctly notes that the presence of part-time or contract help does not affect official FTE headcount under the stated resolution criteria. The rationale is appropriately skeptical of unseen, late-stage hiring surges in the absence of public markers, and the cautious but not extremely low probability (15%) reflects both the muted growth environment and the small but real possibility of a modest, last-minute FTE uptick.

Recent years have also seen a contraction in new multi-year grants in the EA/governance space, increasing the stickiness of the 1-2 FTE plateau. Furthermore, reporting lag is a valid concern, but the explicit use of full-time, permanent staff as the resolution metric means that contract consolidations or fractional upgrades are less likely to tip the outcome. Thus, while surprise is possible, the unique constraints in this sub-niche and timing (with no news of October expansion) justify a probability below sectoral averages.

The base rate argument\u2014that niche governance-oriented nonprofits rarely grow past two FTE without a major funding event\u2014is consistent with both nonprofit management literature and effective altruism/longtermism sector experience. Importantly, your probabilistic hedge that recognizes the possibility of a recent but as-yet-unpublicized grant demonstrates prudent risk assessment: not so high as to ignore sector constraints, but not zeroed-out in case of reporting lag or opaque funder channels. This approach is substantively aligned with both capacity-building models and resource-dependence perspectives, making your 30% forecast robust and appropriate for current evidence and sector trends."

The sectoral base rate you rely on is sound, and your weighting of the probability (18%) is well-justified\u2014not overly skeptical (recognizing nonzero latent risk) but clearly anchored in observed sector inertia and the tight post-2022 funding environment for EA/longtermist entities.

Multiple independent domain experts emphasized the extremely low frequency of late-year hiring and the historically conservative staffing in this niche. Moreover, none surfaced an argument or data point that would increase the likelihood.

The consensus, and especially the defense of life cycle and resource dependence theories, supports my initial case: While large, transformative expansion is unlikely, a modest uptick (from 2 to 3 FTE) could happen due to late-year or unpublicized hiring. At the same time, the persistent absence of reporting, in concert with a tough funding environment, makes any substantial upward revision hard to justify.

Critiques correctly highlight that, while major transformative growth is rare, base rates for moving from 2 to 3 FTEs over several years remain meaningfully above zero. Furthermore, the risk of an unreported, late-year hiring due to a minor grant, or consolidation of fractional roles, is not negligible\u2014especially given the small N.

As such, while the small-N uncertainty always leaves room for an upward revision, there is no new information or argument that materially increases the probability above my original estimate.

Critiques of a very low (e.g., 8%) probability did address the underestimated possibility of ordinary incremental hiring or reporting lag, but persuasive counterpoints highlighted that these are less common in this specific sectoral context. There remains a nontrivial, but modest, probability that late-breaking grant activity could result in a hire, but not enough evidence emerged to move the probability above the initial range.

Participants stressed the need to fully utilize women's potential to build a resilient cyber environment, increase awareness and knowledge among female students, and develop their skills through specialized mentoring programs. This aligns with the global initiative launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to advance women in cybersecurity, addressing challenges of low participation and growing shortages of female professionals to strengthen global cyber resilience. The final day featured high-level discussions with policymakers and experts from international organizations. Dr. Hanan Al-Ahmadi, Deputy Chair of the Saudi Shura Council, highlighted Saudi Arabia's commitment to supporting women's capabilities in cybersecurity in line with Vision 2030, noting that the nation\u2019s experience offers valuable lessons in global cyber resilience and that the Shura Council plays a key role through its legislative and oversight functions. The forum released a joint report by the International Cybersecurity Forum and Duke University titled 'Bridging the Gaps: Challenges and Barriers to Expanding Women's Workforce in Latin America,' based on field research conducted in 2025 involving female professionals and university students across Latin America. The report found that 64% of respondents perceive women's representation in the field as significantly weak, due to limited early engagement in STEM subjects and lack of guidance. Over 40% of participants expressed low confidence in their technical skills, and more than 53.3% were unaware of cybersecurity career opportunities, underscoring the need for mentorship. Concurrently, the third cohort of the 'Empowering Women in Cyber Leadership' program, launched in February 2025 with the USTTI Institute, brought together female trainees from 39 countries. The 'Child Cyber Safety Index' was also launched in collaboration with the DQ Institute and international partners, serving as a global tool to measure progress in building a safer cyber space for children. The index, based on a comprehensive methodology, assesses multiple dimensions including schools, families, infrastructure, private sector companies, and national policies, aiming to provide actionable insights for decision-makers and promote global cooperation in addressing growing cyber threats to children.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 03:10 AM\nSource:[aawsat.com](https://aawsat.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC/5193009-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%89-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AF-%D9%81%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%81-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A)\n\n**Comprender el Estado': A Cycle Strengthening the Link Between Culture and Public Governance in Misiones**\nThe 'Comprender el Estado' (Understanding the State) conversation series, organized by the Instituto de Artes Audiovisuales de Misiones (IAAviM) and the Instituto Misionero de Estudios Superiores (IMES) through the Centro Misionero de Estudios Regionales (CEMER), concluded on October 4, 2025, after five hybrid sessions held between August and September 2025. The initiative aimed to strengthen the cultural and audiovisual sector\u2019s role in public policy-making by providing introductory tools in political science and public management tailored to the provincial context. Participants explored topics including the structure of the state, the policy cycle, data-driven decision-making, and digitalization. According to Mariana Lombardini, IAAviM\u2019s Fomento manager, the series fostered institutional articulation and improved administrative efficiency, enabling cultural institutes to deliver better public services and support modernization and democratization of policies. Silvana Gonz\u00e1lez, head of the Provincial Audiovisual Registry, noted the initiative originated from a direct request by the cultural sector during the Audiovisual Public Policies Consultative Forum, emphasizing that understanding state mechanisms enhances territorial influence and leadership in the productive ecosystem. Ver\u00f3nica Jakus, from the Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Cultura, praised the blend of theory and practice, facilitated by collaboration between educators and cultural leaders, and highlighted strong online engagement. Veroka Fedeli, a theater producer and IPTI councilor, described the cycle as highly enlightening, providing practical tools for institutional synergy and called for its permanent repetition. The initiative received institutional support from the Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Cultura, IPTI, and IPD, with participation from key figures including IAAviM president Sergio Acosta, IPTI president Omar Holz, and IMES rector Mariano Pianovi. The series successfully achieved its goal of bridging the cultural sector with state structures, equipping participants with tools for more efficient management and active participation in public policy construction in Misiones.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 12:52 PM\nSource:[MisionesOnline](https://misionesonline.net/2025/10/04/comprender-el-estado-2/)\n\n**Doha Forum and partners launch future of International Cooperation Report 2025**\nThe Doha Forum, in partnership with the Stimson Center, the Global Governance Innovation Network, and the Global Institute for Strategic Research at HBKU, launched the Future of International Cooperation Report 2025 (FIC'25) during a UNGA80 side event in New York, co-hosted by the International Peace Institute (IPI). The report, themed 'Justice in Action: Beyond Promises to Progress,' identifies a widening global justice gap driven by inequality, insecurity, exclusion, corruption, and environmental decline, and calls for bold, collective action across governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. It outlines three critical domains\u2014political-judicial, socioeconomic, and environmental\u2014where governance must evolve to safeguard rights, foster inclusive societies, and harness innovation. The report provides practical tools and core principles for reform. HE Mubarak Ajlan al-Kuwari, Executive Director of Doha Forum, emphasized that justice is foundational to sustainable governance and must remain central to global cooperation. Brian Finlay, President and CEO of the Stimson Center, highlighted the report\u2019s role in reimagining equitable institutions. IPI President Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein affirmed the partnership\u2019s shared commitment to fostering collaboration and trust. A high-level panel discussion titled 'Justice in Action: Beyond Promises to Progress' followed the launch, bringing together policymakers, researchers, and civil society leaders.

The CGGI evaluates governments across seven pillars\u2014leadership, laws and policies, institutions, financial stewardship, marketplace, global reputation, and helping people rise\u2014each weighted equally. South Africa scored particularly poorly in 'Helping People Rise,' ranking 113th out of 120, with the lowest scores in personal safety and employment, and near-bottom rankings in health services and income distribution. Despite this, Dinesh Naidu of the Chandler Institute of Governance notes that South Africa's underlying score improved slightly from 0.453 in 2021 to 0.461 in 2025, and it remains 5th in Africa, behind Mauritius, Botswana, Rwanda, and Morocco. Naidu explains that while absolute performance has not declined, relative standing has weakened because other countries advanced faster. The report emphasizes that strong governance correlates with institutional quality, rule of law, and ethical leadership, and warns that the governance gap is widening: top performers improve consistently, while bottom performers decline. The authors note that 57 countries saw their CGGI scores drop between 2021 and 2025, with only five\u2014UAE, Spain, Vietnam, Mongolia, and China\u2014showing consistent improvement. Africa\u2019s average governance score remains the lowest globally, with improvements in institutional strength but declines in financial stewardship, global reputation, and helping people rise.

Participants stressed the need to fully utilize women's potential to build a resilient cyber environment, increase awareness and knowledge among female students, and develop their skills through specialized mentoring programs. This aligns with the global initiative launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to advance women in cybersecurity, addressing challenges of low participation and growing shortages of female professionals to strengthen global cyber resilience. The final day featured high-level discussions with policymakers and experts from international organizations. Dr. Hanan Al-Ahmadi, Deputy Chair of the Saudi Shura Council, highlighted Saudi Arabia's commitment to supporting women's capabilities in cybersecurity in line with Vision 2030, noting that the nation\u2019s experience offers valuable lessons in global cyber resilience and that the Shura Council plays a key role through its legislative and oversight functions. The forum released a joint report by the International Cybersecurity Forum and Duke University titled 'Bridging the Gaps: Challenges and Barriers to Expanding Women's Workforce in Latin America,' based on field research conducted in 2025 involving female professionals and university students across Latin America. The report found that 64% of respondents perceive women's representation in the field as significantly weak, due to limited early engagement in STEM subjects and lack of guidance. Over 40% of participants expressed low confidence in their technical skills, and more than 53.3% were unaware of cybersecurity career opportunities, underscoring the need for mentorship. Concurrently, the third cohort of the 'Empowering Women in Cyber Leadership' program, launched in February 2025 with the USTTI Institute, brought together female trainees from 39 countries. The 'Child Cyber Safety Index' was also launched in collaboration with the DQ Institute and international partners, serving as a global tool to measure progress in building a safer cyber space for children. The index, based on a comprehensive methodology, assesses multiple dimensions including schools, families, infrastructure, private sector companies, and national policies, aiming to provide actionable insights for decision-makers and promote global cooperation in addressing growing cyber threats to children.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 03:10 AM\nSource:[aawsat.com](https://aawsat.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC/5193009-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%89-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AF-%D9%81%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%81-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A)\n\n**Doha Institute, SAEA host food security forum on Sudan**\nThe Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, through its School of Economics, Administration, and Public Policy, in collaboration with the Sudanese Agricultural Engineers Association (SAEA) in Qatar, hosted a forum in Doha on October 4, 2025, focused on effective partnerships for achieving food security in Sudan amid ongoing political, economic, and climate crises. The event brought together representatives from the Qatar Fund for Development, Qatar Red Crescent Society, Qatar Charity, Sudan\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, academic experts, and stakeholders in agricultural development. Dr. Abdelwahab El Affendi, President of the Doha Institute, emphasized that agricultural security must not come at the expense of farmers, noting that Sudan\u2014once called the 'breadbasket of the Arab world'\u2014now faces severe food crises due to falling crop prices, inadequate storage and marketing systems, and systemic policy failures. Dr. Ayhab Saad, Dean of the School, highlighted that Sudan\u2019s agricultural sector employs 60% of the workforce but has productivity below 30%, attributing this gap to a lack of specialized economic research, outdated data, and insufficient data collection systems. The forum aimed to establish practical frameworks for collaboration between academic institutions and governmental and charitable organizations to develop sustainable food security solutions. Key topics included the impacts of climate change, internal conflict on agricultural production, declining output, rising poverty and displacement, and the need for integrated policies that combine social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The forum also emphasized the critical role of Qatari and regional institutions in providing financial, technical, and expert support, while advocating for regional and international cooperation to foster knowledge exchange and strategic partnerships to address shared challenges.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 02:40 PM\nSource:[The Peninsula](http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/04/10/2025/doha-institute-saea-host-food-security-forum-on-sudan)\n\n**Qatar Institute Hosts Forum on Food Security in Sudan**\nThe 'Food Security in Sudan' forum launched in Doha on October 4, 2025, organized by the Qatar Institute for Graduate Studies and the Sudanese Agricultural Engineers Association, with participation from Qatari, Sudanese, and regional entities. The forum aims to strengthen partnerships to achieve food security amid political, economic crises, and climate change. Abdul Wahab Al-Afandy, President of the Qatar Institute for Graduate Studies, emphasized the importance of supporting agricultural efforts, highlighting that food crises in Sudan stem more from ineffective government policies than low production, and criticized unfair market and storage practices that harm farmers. He noted that Sudan, once known as the 'basket of the Arab world,' now faces food insecurity due to policy failures, including low harvest prices and inadequate storage and marketing systems. Ayoub Saad, Dean of the College of Economics, Management, and Public Policy, stated that Sudan\u2019s agricultural sector employs about 60% of the workforce but achieves only 30% of its potential, attributing this gap to a lack of specialized economic studies and updated data. He called for investment in agricultural data collection and statistics to enable more effective policy-making. The forum also addresses the impacts of climate change and internal conflicts on agriculture, leading to reduced production, increased poverty, and displacement. It seeks to develop practical frameworks for collaboration between academic and research institutions and governmental and humanitarian organizations to create sustainable solutions. Key discussion topics include formulating effective and sustainable agricultural policies that integrate social and economic dimensions, enhancing local production, protecting natural resources, and leveraging support from Qatari and regional development and humanitarian organizations through expertise, financial, and technical resources. The forum also explores opportunities for regional and international cooperation to build strategic partnerships in addressing shared challenges.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 01:48 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B6%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86)\n\n**Comprender el Estado': A Cycle Strengthening the Link Between Culture and Public Governance in Misiones**\nThe 'Comprender el Estado' (Understanding the State) conversation series, organized by the Instituto de Artes Audiovisuales de Misiones (IAAviM) and the Instituto Misionero de Estudios Superiores (IMES) through the Centro Misionero de Estudios Regionales (CEMER), concluded on October 4, 2025, after five hybrid sessions held between August and September 2025. The initiative aimed to strengthen the cultural and audiovisual sector\u2019s role in public policy-making by providing introductory tools in political science and public management tailored to the provincial context. Participants explored topics including the structure of the state, the policy cycle, data-driven decision-making, and digitalization. According to Mariana Lombardini, IAAviM\u2019s Fomento manager, the series fostered institutional articulation and improved administrative efficiency, enabling cultural institutes to deliver better public services and support modernization and democratization of policies. Silvana Gonz\u00e1lez, head of the Provincial Audiovisual Registry, noted the initiative originated from a direct request by the cultural sector during the Audiovisual Public Policies Consultative Forum, emphasizing that understanding state mechanisms enhances territorial influence and leadership in the productive ecosystem. Ver\u00f3nica Jakus, from the Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Cultura, praised the blend of theory and practice, facilitated by collaboration between educators and cultural leaders, and highlighted strong online engagement. Veroka Fedeli, a theater producer and IPTI councilor, described the cycle as highly enlightening, providing practical tools for institutional synergy and called for its permanent repetition. The initiative received institutional support from the Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Cultura, IPTI, and IPD, with participation from key figures including IAAviM president Sergio Acosta, IPTI president Omar Holz, and IMES rector Mariano Pianovi.

This absence intensified concerns after ADP reported a loss of 32,000 jobs, fueling fears of a labor recession. However, private-sector alternatives provided a more optimistic outlook. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported a modest rebound in manufacturing and service sector jobs, though it does not provide absolute employment numbers. More notably, Revelio Labs' September edition of the Revelio Public Labor Statistics (RPLS) indicated a gain of 60,000 jobs\u2014its best monthly increase of 2025\u2014driven by education, health services, and retail trade, while leisure and hospitality and business services saw declines. Revelio\u2019s regression model estimated the BLS would have reported approximately 38,000 jobs gained, far less negative than ADP\u2019s figure. Chief Economist Lisa Simon stated that while the RPLS gain was slightly above expectations, declines in job postings, salaries, hiring, and attrition signal a slowing labor market. Nevertheless, the data suggests the labor market is not in freefall, supporting the narrative that the Fed is cutting rates into a slowdown, not a recession. RPLS, a freely available dataset built from over 100 million U.S. profiles, offers real-time, scalable labor market insights comparable to BLS data, aiming to close the information gap during official data voids.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 04:59 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/who-needs-bls-us-added-60000-jobs-september-best-month-2025)\n\n**SA citizens left behind as other countries improve | The Citizen**\nSouth Africa ranked 77th out of 120 countries in the 2025 Chandler Good Government Index (CGGI), a decline from 70th in 2021 and below Rwanda (59th) and Botswana (61st), making it the lowest-ranked country in Africa. The CGGI evaluates governments across seven pillars\u2014leadership, laws and policies, institutions, financial stewardship, marketplace, global reputation, and helping people rise\u2014each weighted equally. South Africa scored particularly poorly in 'Helping People Rise,' ranking 113th out of 120, with the lowest scores in personal safety and employment, and near-bottom rankings in health services and income distribution. Despite this, Dinesh Naidu of the Chandler Institute of Governance notes that South Africa's underlying score improved slightly from 0.453 in 2021 to 0.461 in 2025, and it remains 5th in Africa, behind Mauritius, Botswana, Rwanda, and Morocco. Naidu explains that while absolute performance has not declined, relative standing has weakened because other countries advanced faster. The report emphasizes that strong governance correlates with institutional quality, rule of law, and ethical leadership, and warns that the governance gap is widening: top performers improve consistently, while bottom performers decline. The authors note that 57 countries saw their CGGI scores drop between 2021 and 2025, with only five\u2014UAE, Spain, Vietnam, Mongolia, and China\u2014showing consistent improvement. Africa\u2019s average governance score remains the lowest globally, with improvements in institutional strength but declines in financial stewardship, global reputation, and helping people rise.

Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer last month and nominated EJ Antoni. Trump intensified the attack after the BLS lowered its wage\u2011employment estimates for the year to March\u202f2025 by more than 900,000 jobs. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the revision highlighted the need for \u2018truthful and honest data\u2019 and called the BLS \u2018broken\u2019.

Private data providers like ADP, Revelio Labs, and others are gaining prominence, with ADP\u2019s employment report searches tripling recently. However, experts caution that private data\u2019s reliability depends on official benchmarks, and that a total shift away from public statistics is unlikely because legislation ties certain metrics to official data.

He described real\u2011impact incidents as a \"murder case\" and stressed that \"seeing the process allows interception before the breach is complete.\"  The weekly report aggregates data from incident reports, joint\u2011defense monitoring, external exposure, and dark\u2011web intelligence, presenting them on dashboards that trace attack chains from initial intrusion to final impact.  Lin cited a bi\u2011weekly external exposure analysis showing that public agencies have lower risk than certain key industries, noting that \"long\u2011term requirements and audits do reduce risk.\"  By year\u2011end, NCIS plans to release an automated analysis tool to assess compliance and audit gaps, forming a full \"cybersecurity scorecard.\"  Each issue also contains a focus article on recent incidents, attack\u2011defense drills, and fraud trends.  Lin mentioned a partnership with Meta and LINE that has successfully removed large volumes of scam ads and groups, reducing the visibility of fraud content on social platforms.  He reiterated, \"Seeing enables effective governance; effective governance lets us know whether we are managing well.\"  NCIS Director\u2011General Cai Fu\u2011long added that information sharing is the foundation of joint defense, and that the weekly report complements the monthly report to help agencies, industry, and the cybersecurity community quickly grasp threat trends, \"raising public cybersecurity awareness to build a real protective net.\"  Lin concluded that as data accumulates and analysis matures, the weekly report will become the core platform for monitoring national cybersecurity, turning the slogan \"seeing enables effective governance\" into a sustained shift from passive defense to proactive governance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 10:24 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/9/12/n14592576.htm)\n\n**Experts Question Effectiveness of Government\u2019s Public Institution Management Evaluation Score Adjustment**\nExperts argue that merely increasing the weight of the safety\u2011management component in the public\u2011institution management evaluation will not substantially curb major accidents. Kim Cheol, senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for Social Public Research, told Hankyoreh on 26\u202fAugust that \"\uacf5\uacf5\uae30\uad00\uacbd\uc601\ud3c9\uac00(\uc774\ud558 \uacbd\uc601\ud3c9\uac00) \uac1c\uc120\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uacf5\uacf5\uae30\uad00\uc758 \uc911\ub300\uc7ac\ud574 \uac10\ucd95\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uae30\ub300\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\" and added that even if the safety\u2011management score is raised, public institutions have little incentive to invest more in safety or staff because other components\u2014financial soundness, operational efficiency\u2014carry higher weight. The Ministry of Economy and Finance announced on 22\u202fAugust that the safety\u2011management share in the evaluation, currently 1.5\u20132\u202f%, would be expanded as part of a major\u2011accident\u2011reduction plan. However, experts note that because the efficiency\u2011management and total personnel\u2011cost components are weighted more heavily, increasing safety staff could actually lower scores in those areas, reducing the overall incentive. Kim suggested a compliance\u2011based absolute\u2011assessment approach, with penalties for non\u2011compliance, would be more effective, and that a safety\u2011management governance structure involving on\u2011site staff and unions is needed. Professor Kang Tae\u2011seon of Seoul Cyber University and union head Kang Seong\u2011gyu also called for collaborative development of safety manuals with the private sector and for the Ministry to involve frontline workers in policy design.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 12:28 PM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/labor/1215382.html)\n\n**2025 Global Internet Governance Forum: Paradigm Initiative Drives Grassroots Digital Rights Conversations**\nThe Paradigm Initiative (PIN) will engage with global stakeholders at the 2025 Global Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in Lillestr\u00f8m, Norway, to shape policies that uphold a free, open, and inclusive internet. According to Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of PIN, 'This forum comes at a crucial time when digital governance decisions are shaping the future of billions of individuals.' PIN will participate in strategic sessions, including 'Bridging the Connectivity Gap for Excluded Communities' and 'Protecting the Free Open Internet with Freedom House.' The team will also meet with partners such as Meta, UNESCO, and the Freedom Online Coalition to ensure digital rights are rooted in grassroots realities and global governance is inclusive of marginalised voices. 'At PIN, we believe meaningful digital inclusion requires more than just connectivity; it demands inclusive, progressive, and sustainable policies and frameworks built by considering grassroots stakeholders' realities,' Sesan said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 03:27 AM\nSource:[THISDAYLIVE](https://www.thisdaylive.com/2025/06/24/2025-global-internet-governance-forum-paradigm-initiative-drives-grassroots-digital-rights-conversations/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse group of experts specializing in nonprofit operations, strategic management, organizational studies, nonprofit management, and European nonprofit regulation, there is a strong consensus that the probability of the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance having more than two full-time employees at the end of 2025 is low. Nearly all experts note that the Institute has historically maintained a slim staff of one to two full-time employees, supplementing with part-timers, contractors, or volunteers, and that no recent public signals (such as new grant announcements, visible expansion initiatives, or major project launches) indicate imminent or actual growth in headcount.\n\nCommon bases for skepticism include limited evidence of new or diversified funding (especially post-FTX contraction in effective altruism-aligned grantmaking), conservative staffing patterns among small European and EA-sector policy nonprofits, the absence of public communication of expansion, and a broader macro-environment of retrenchment in the sector. Several experts assign a nonzero probability to a surprise late-year grant or hiring round, but repeatedly emphasize that such events are rare and, if they occurred, would likely be evident in the organization's reporting or community forums.\n\nAcross all perspectives, the core scenario for a 'No' outcome is SI continuing with 1\u20132 FTEs, remaining active but not expanding significantly, while a 'Yes' scenario generally requires an unlikely but possible major grant or partnership requiring new full-time hires. Weighted by argument quality and probability assignments (ranging mostly 8\u201332% for 'Yes'), the expert consensus is that the chances SI reports more than 2 full-time employees by end-2025 are modest but clearly below even odds. The most informed and plausible probability estimates cluster between 10\u201332%, with a preponderance near the lower end of that band.",
