The attempted drone attack on a TurkStream facility this year, while unsuccessful, is a warning. However, most technical failures or expected maintenance are explicitly excluded from resolving Yes per the fine print, and rapid remediation is likely for all damage short of major sabotage. The probability of even a brief, genuinely unexpected interruption\u2014caused by sabotage/attack, accident, or extraordinary event and reported in credible sources\u2014is above baseline, but still well below 50%. I judge that the risk is meaningful but not high, especially as both Turkey and Russia are keen to preserve operability and rapid response; thus, credible, non-scheduled, unexpected shutdown for any nonzero time is possible (given what we've seen on oil lines), but would likely be quickly covered up or fixed.

The clear precedent exists for targeting gas pipelines, and Russia itself has claimed multiple attempted attacks on TurkStream compressor stations in 2025 (though with minor damage so far). Declining Russian internal resilience under the strain of war and repeated sabotage marginally raises the probability of Ukrainian operations achieving a short, unplanned outage. On the other hand, major modern gas pipelines are far more robust and harder to damage irreparably than aboveground oil installations. Russia and Turkey have maximal incentives and technical means to rapidly restore service if an incident occurs, and both pipelines have run reliably despite the high-risk environment. As proof, oil pipelines struck by drones have returned to service quickly or seen only short term stoppages, and TurkStream continues to operate with record volumes. Evaluation of historical base rates for sabotage-induced outages on gas pipelines in active war/terror environments suggests out-of-pattern unscheduled interruptions remain rare but do happen (e.g., Nord Stream sabotage in 2022, but Druzhba and others have had stoppages of hours/days). Given Ukraine's demonstrated reach, intent, and increased frequency of attacks, the base rate for a short, unexpected stoppage of either pipeline\u2014even if quickly resolved\u2014must be moderately elevated for the remainder of 2025.

The base rate for at least a brief unexpected interruption is no longer negligible: since 2022, multiple high-profile pipelines have experienced sabotage or unscheduled outages. However, TurkStream and Blue Stream have been prioritized for protection and repairs, and both Russian and Turkish interests are aligned to prevent flux.

Ukrainian intent and capability to strike pipelines are virtually confirmed and well reported. Recent cases (e.g., attempted attacks on TurkStream in Krasnodar) show persistent targeting, though so far physical and operational resilience has been adequate to prevent substantial unscheduled stops. Over the past few months, Ukrainian kinetic operations achieved temporary shutdowns of oil lines despite high resilience and security, setting a tactical precedent. However, gas pipelines are less vulnerable to catastrophic lasting disruption than oil lines, and both Russia and Turkey have strong incentives for immediate response and repair, including reclassifying incidents (for information control) to avoid the appearance of weakness. That said, with only about three months remaining in the year, elevated threat levels, and prior near-misses, the risk is now materially above historical peacetime norms but not overwhelmingly likely. In my judgment, the chance that a credible, unexpected (i.e., not maintenance-justified), public stoppage of gas flow across either TurkStream or Blue Stream exceeds 1% per month in the current context, yielding a compounded risk of 15-25%. The highest risks are via successful drone/kinetic attack on a compressor or metering station, or a highly publicized cross-border cyber or sabotage incident.

Recent reporting documents direct Ukrainian attempts on TurkStream compressor stations and continued attacks on Russian energy infrastructure closer to Ukraine and deep inside Russia, with increasing frequency and demonstrated effectiveness. Given the extreme importance of TurkStream and Blue Stream as Russia\u2019s last pipeline supplies to Turkey and the EU, both sides have strong incentives to protect/restore flows\u2014but higher target value also attracts bolder attacks. Protection, rapid repair, and the need for plausible deniability will mitigate most but not all risk.\n\nDespite escalation, the technical, operational, and diplomatic resilience of these pipelines should not be underestimated. Russia and Turkey have coped with attempted attacks during 2025 already. However, the bar for 'unexpectedly ceasing' is fairly low; even an unplanned outage of a few hours if credibly attributed to attack or technical side-effect (without 'scheduled' cover) would resolve Yes.\n\nWeighing these factors, I assess the base rate at 5\u201310% in 'ordinary' years, but the combination of ongoing Ukrainian targeting, relative performance on oil lines, and past attempts on TurkStream merit a moderately elevated probability.

(3) Russia/Turkey have strong repair and operational incentives, and perhaps intelligence sharing, but each additional successful Ukrainian strike increases both psychological risk in markets and the chances of a temporary, unplanned outage.

There is no evidence that Blue Stream or TurkStream have suffered any unexpected halts so far in 2025, and bilateral incentives to maintain flows are very high. Still, the rapidly growing frequency, range, and sophistication of Ukrainian drone attacks, the successful brief shutdowns of multiple oil pipelines, and the presence of only one viable Russian-EU gas route means risk has risen significantly relative to historical averages. The highest likelihood scenario would be a brief (hours to days) unscheduled shutdown of TurkStream's Russian land infrastructure due to a successful drone or sabotage attack, leading to a temporary, well-publicized flow halt.

Given this, I am adjusting my forecast downward slightly to account for the collective technical expertise and empirical base rates, while still staying clearly above historical norms.",

Arguments justifying higher probabilities (above 30%) cite not just intent and demonstrated Ukrainian capability, but focus on the very low bar for a 'Yes' outcome and the recent surge in sabotage of Russian energy assets. However, multiple forecasters (and my own original analysis) highlight the following: (1) The technical and operational resilience of large-diameter, partially submarine export gas pipelines, managing to avoid even brief, public, unscheduled halts despite repeated attempts; (2) The strong mutual interest and response capabilities of both Russia and Turkey, both rapid repair and information control; (3) Most real-world sabotage or disruption success has targeted oil infrastructure or overland assets, with gas trunklines\u2014especially these\u2014showing greater resistance thus far. A few arguments raised in favor of higher risk do deserve slight upward adjustment, particularly around the rising monthly risk in this extraordinarily tense year, the reduced redundancy in the network (making any outage far more newsworthy), and the tail risk that even a minor, accidental, or briefly successful drone strike could lead to a 'Yes.' Overall, although my initial (17%) leaned conservative, I now see that the compounded monthly risk and the escalation in both frequency and geographical range of attacks slightly raise the cumulative odds over the next three months. I therefore increase my forecast probability to 22%.",

However, multiple experts, particularly those with pipeline engineering and threat analysis backgrounds, persuasively emphasize the track record of robust technical resilience and rapid repair, especially for subsea pipelines like TurkStream and Blue Stream. Additionally, even within this heightened environment, observed and openly acknowledged unscheduled stoppages of export gas pipelines remain rare, and the incentives for both Russia and Turkey to mask or rectify disruptions are very strong. The critiques of the 62% probability by technical experts were well-founded: such an extreme stance may overweight intent and trend, while underweighting protective, operational, and reputational buffers. Compared to my initial probability, these arguments (especially the repeated technical observation that no such gas pipeline has seen an unscheduled halt in 2025 so far, despite increased attacks, and the effective resilience to minor incidents) suggest a modest downward adjustment is warranted, though not a dramatic one given continued escalation and the low bar for question resolution.",

Notably, most other forecasters with technical and operational risk backgrounds set their probabilities in the 20-38% range. The one much higher forecast (62%) appears to overweight transfer of risk from oil pipelines to the physically more robust gas export infrastructure, a weakness highlighted by myself and several others. Arguments supporting a probability in the 15-38% range consistently note (1) the extraordinary technical/diplomatic incentives to maintain flows, (2) that even successful attacks on gas pipelines have thus far resulted in rapid, unpublicized repairs, and (3) that geopolitical/military escalation still favors resilience and coverup for anything short of a catastrophic event. There was no evidence or argument that merited lowering my probability below my initial position, but the preponderance of peer arguments in the mid/high-20s to high-30s validates staying within this calibrated range.

The dialogue consistently affirmed both the meaningful recent escalation in Ukrainian kinetic capabilities and the comparatively heightened technical and security resilience of gas pipelines versus oil lines. Critiques of much higher probabilities (e.g., 62%) were well-defended: the repeated theme is that, while Ukraine's intent and frequency of attacks are undeniable and represent a paradigm shift, actual unscheduled, credibly-sourced gas pipeline interruptions of this class remain rare, especially under such intense protection and mutual strategic interest. Likewise, the group highlighted strong incentives for rapid repair, information control, and even obfuscation by Russia and Turkey. The technical nuance around pipeline construction, subsea advantages, and the rarity of gas sabotage-induced outages in war (absent exceptional events like Nord Stream) was especially compelling. No group arguments supported a material reduction in risk below my initial estimate, nor were any raised that justified pushing toward a majority-likelihood outcome.

This increase is partly due to Ukraine halting its transit of Russian gas to Europe on January 1, 2025, making TurkStream [the sole route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurkStream#Route) for Russian gas deliveries to Europe.\n\nFurther, Russia has accused Ukraine of attempting to attack the TurkStream pipeline on [multiple](https://energynews.pro/en/russia-accuses-ukraine-again-of-attacking-the-turkstream-pipeline/) [occasions](https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-repelled-ukrainian-drone-192450297.html). In March 2025, Russia [claimed](https://www.dailysabah.com/business/energy/russia-says-thwarted-ukrainian-drone-attack-on-turkstream-pipeline) to have intercepted drones targeting the pipeline, which it views as attempts to disrupt gas deliveries to Europe.&#x20;\n\nConcerning the Blue Stream pipeline, the major gas contract between Gazprom and Turkey for the pipeline [is set to expire](https://energynews.pro/en/turkey-facing-the-expiration-of-major-gas-contracts-in-2025-2026/) at the end of 2025.

According to regional authorities, the strike caused only minor damage and posed no threat to the local population. The station, owned by Transneft\u2013Prikamye and part of the Almetyevsk\u2013Gorky trunk pipeline, contains six storage tanks with a total capacity of 120,000 cubic meters, as reported by the Moscow\u202fTimes. Ukrainian Commander\u2011in\u2011Chief Oleksandr\u202fSyrskyi said that over the past two months the Defense Forces have successfully hit 85 significant targets on Russian territory, 33 of which were strictly military and 52 were part of Russia\u2019s defense\u2011industrial complex. Syrskyi added that these operations have triggered a fuel crisis, directly affecting the military\u2019s logistics and supply. One such facility was the Afipsky oil refinery, attacked on September\u202f26, which processed about 6.25\u202fmillion tons of oil per year. Since early August, Ukraine has targeted Russian oil refining facilities, knocking out at least five major plants. Reuters reports that Russia\u2019s refining capacity has fallen 17\u202f% to 1.1\u202fmillion barrels per day, while Kommersant\u2019s sources say gasoline output is down about 10\u202f%. As a result, more than 300 gas stations have closed nationwide, and some regions have limited retail fuel sales to 10\u201320\u202fliters per customer. Exchange\u2011traded gasoline prices have risen 40\u201350\u202f% since the start of the year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u202fZelensky stated that U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump approved strikes on Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure and that Trump believes the attacks should follow an \u2018eye for an eye\u2019 principle.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 06:09 AM\nSource:[uawire.org](https://uawire.org/ukrainian-drone-strike-disrupts-operations-at-russian-oil-pumping-station-in-chuvashia)\n\n**Ukrainian Drone Attacks 'Friendship' Oil Pipeline Pump Station; Zelensky: Ukraine Will Implement Controlled Export of Non-Scarce Weapons; Latest Statements from Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers**\nAccording to the article, on 27 September 2025 a Ukrainian National Security Agency drone struck a pump station on Russia's 'Friendship' oil pipeline in the Chuvash Republic, causing a fire and halting oil transport. The article reports that Russian officials confirmed the attack but said it did not cause serious damage. Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said the attack did not affect Hungary's oil supply and later denied the drone evidence posted by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Shtyba.

The article reports that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking at the 80th UN General Assembly, said Russia remains willing to resolve the conflict through dialogue, will discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, and that any aggression against Russia would be met with a firm response.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 11:36 PM\nSource:[\u6bcf\u65e5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b0\u95fb](https://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2025-09-28/4077904.html)\n\n**Critical Energy Pipeline Hit: Oil Pipeline to the Black Sea Disrupted**\nA drone strike in Chuvashia, about 1,000\u202fkm from the Ukrainian border, hit the Tynhgovatovo oil pumping station and temporarily shut down the pipeline that carries crude oil to the Black Sea. The attack, which occurred on 27\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, caused the pipeline to be closed for a short period. According to the article, the Chuvash Republic\u2019s president, Oleg\u202fNikolaev, posted on social media: 'Bug\u00fcn sabah, insans\u0131z hava ara\u00e7lar\u0131 kullanma giri\u015fimi kaydedildi.' The Russian Defence Ministry later reported that 55 drones were shot down during the night. The pipeline had also been struck on 9\u202fJune\u202f2025, leading to another temporary shutdown. Earlier, on 26\u202fSeptember\u202f2024, the Afipsky oil refinery in Krasnodar was hit by a similar drone attack; the resulting fire affected a 30\u2011square\u2011meter area and damaged one production unit, but no casualties were reported.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[T\u00fcrkiye](https://www.turkiyegazetesi.com.tr/dunya/kritik-enerji-hatti-vuruldu-karadenize-giden-petrol-borusu-devre-disi-1148877)\n\n**Ukraine's Oil Blitz Hits Putin**\nThe Telegraph reports that Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, pipelines and port terminals have caused a nationwide fuel shortage, higher prices, and government rationing of gasoline and diesel.  According to experts, the strikes cut oil processing by almost 20\u202f% on some days and disrupted exports from key ports, weakening Russia\u2019s ability to finance the war.  Fuel shortages have spread from the Far East to central Russia, including Moscow \u2013 the first time the capital has felt the impact of combat operations so close to civilian life.  Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak downplayed the situation, calling it a \u2018small deficit\u2019, but analysts say the drone attacks on domestic fuel supplies are severely affecting the population and businesses.  U.S. and EU pressure continues, with former President Donald Trump urging Europe to stop importing Russian energy and the EU accelerating its exit from Russian gas by the end of 2026.  Analysts argue that the attacks are among the most effective sanctions because they directly hit Russia\u2019s military budget.  \"The situation is not critical. Russia has enough oil and gas reserves and financial reserves to overcome this inconvenience, and the goal of conquering Ukraine is a much more valuable prize,\" said Emily\u202fFarris, RUSI analyst.  Recent drone strikes hit a pumping station in Chuvashia and the Afipsky refinery in Krasnodar Krai, the latter of which supplies diesel and gasoline to the Russian army.  \"On the domestic market, Ukrainian attacks have a large impact. Drones target facilities that supply internal fuel deliveries\u2026 across Russia there is a shortage, which further strains the already tense internal balance,\" said Luk\u202fVikenden, analyst at the Center for Energy and Clean Air.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 11:33 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u041d\u0406\u0410\u041d](https://www.unian.net/world/ataki-na-rossiyskie-npz-toplivnyy-krizis-porazil-putina-13144314.html)\n\n**Julia Lumumba Highlights Shared Values Between Russia and Africa Amid Ongoing Geopolitical Tensions**\nJulia Lumumba, daughter of Patrice Lumumba, visited Russia to celebrate the centenary of her father's birth and emphasised that the values for which he died\u2014freedom, justice, true economic and political independence, sovereignty and dignity\u2014are shared by both Russia and Africa. She noted that Russia was the first country to officially protest Patrice Lumumba\u2019s murder and that African nations can realise vast economic potential in a fair, multipolar world, saying, 'in a more just, more real, more multipolar world we have huge opportunities.'  The article then shifts to the ongoing Russia\u2011Ukraine conflict, reporting that Russian forces destroyed a Ukrainian unmanned craft off Crimea and that the Black Sea Fleet used \u2018Lanzet\u2019 anti\u2011ship munitions.  It cites a Telegram post from the Ministry of Defence that the targets were destroyed with small\u2011arms and \u2018Lanzet\u2019 munitions, and that the Russian navy also destroyed a Ukrainian drone\u2011boat on the same day.  The piece mentions a decision to limit non\u2011resident Russian citizens from transferring more than 1\u202fmillion\u202fUSD to foreign accounts, a restriction that will remain from 1\u202fOctober\u202f2025 to 31\u202fMarch\u202f2026.  It reports that Russia is a major supplier of gas, oil and refined products to Turkey, and that Turkish officials say it would be unprofitable to stop Russian supplies; the article quotes economist Igor Yushkov saying that a Turkish refusal would raise prices and benefit U.S. suppliers.  The article also covers U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for Turkey to drop Russian energy, the U.S. plan to double LNG exports, and the EU\u2019s accelerated ban on Russian LNG by 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2027.  In military news, Russian troops reportedly captured the village of Yunanovka in Sumy Oblast, destroying the \u2018live force and equipment\u2019 of several Ukrainian units, and Russian officials claim the capture disrupts Ukrainian logistics.  Finally, the article touches on political developments such as the EU\u2019s proposal for a \u20ac140\u202fbillion reparations loan to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, Belgium\u2019s criticism of the plan, and the Russian Ministry of Justice\u2019s new rules for social payments to mobilised personnel.

The attack caused a fire and halted oil transport through the station, but Russian officials confirmed that the damage was not serious.  Hungarian Foreign Minister Szil\u00e1gyi said the strike did not affect Hungary\u2019s oil supply.  President Zelensky announced that Ukraine will export weapons that are not in short supply to foreign buyers under a controlled regime until the war ends, prioritising the needs of the Ukrainian army and planning to ship surplus arms to Europe, the United States, the Middle East and several African countries.  He noted that a preliminary agreement has been reached with some African states and that one African country has been selected for further negotiations.  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Serebryak posted a map on social media showing the flight paths of two drones that entered Ukrainian airspace from Hungary on 26 September, a claim denied by Hungarian officials.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, speaking at the 80th UN General Assembly on 27 September, reiterated Russia\u2019s willingness to resolve the conflict through dialogue, emphasised the need to protect Russian\u2011speaking residents in Ukraine, and warned that any aggression against Russia would be met with a firm response.

The article reports that Russian officials confirmed the attack but said it did not cause serious damage. Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said the attack did not affect Hungary's oil supply and later denied the drone evidence posted by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Shtyba.

The attack, which occurred on 27\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, caused the pipeline to be closed for a short period.

Earlier, on 26\u202fSeptember\u202f2024, the Afipsky oil refinery in Krasnodar was hit by a similar drone attack; the resulting fire affected a 30\u2011square\u2011meter area and damaged one production unit, but no casualties were reported.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[T\u00fcrkiye](https://www.turkiyegazetesi.com.tr/dunya/kritik-enerji-hatti-vuruldu-karadenize-giden-petrol-borusu-devre-disi-1148877)\n\n**Ukraine's Oil Blitz Hits Putin**\nThe Telegraph reports that Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, pipelines and port terminals have caused a nationwide fuel shortage, higher prices, and government rationing of gasoline and diesel.  According to experts, the strikes cut oil processing by almost 20\u202f% on some days and disrupted exports from key ports, weakening Russia\u2019s ability to finance the war.  Fuel shortages have spread from the Far East to central Russia, including Moscow \u2013 the first time the capital has felt the impact of combat operations so close to civilian life.  Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak downplayed the situation, calling it a \u2018small deficit\u2019, but analysts say the drone attacks on domestic fuel supplies are severely affecting the population and businesses.  U.S. and EU pressure continues, with former President Donald Trump urging Europe to stop importing Russian energy and the EU accelerating its exit from Russian gas by the end of 2026.  Analysts argue that the attacks are among the most effective sanctions because they directly hit Russia\u2019s military budget.  \"The situation is not critical. Russia has enough oil and gas reserves and financial reserves to overcome this inconvenience, and the goal of conquering Ukraine is a much more valuable prize,\" said Emily\u202fFarris, RUSI analyst.  Recent drone strikes hit a pumping station in Chuvashia and the Afipsky refinery in Krasnodar Krai, the latter of which supplies diesel and gasoline to the Russian army.  \"On the domestic market, Ukrainian attacks have a large impact. Drones target facilities that supply internal fuel deliveries\u2026 across Russia there is a shortage, which further strains the already tense internal balance,\" said Luk\u202fVikenden, analyst at the Center for Energy and Clean Air.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 11:33 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u041d\u0406\u0410\u041d](https://www.unian.net/world/ataki-na-rossiyskie-npz-toplivnyy-krizis-porazil-putina-13144314.html)\n\n**Ukraine Attacks Russian Oil Facilities in Another Night of Drone Exchanges**\nOn the night of September 27, 2025, Ukraine and Russia engaged in a high\u2011interception drone exchange. Ukrainian forces launched attacks on Russian oil interests, including a refinery near the Volga; governor Oleg Nikolaev reported the damage as 'da\u00f1os menores' and noted no casualties. Russian air defenses shot down 55 fixed\u2011wing drones over seven regions, matching the previous day\u2019s count. In Rostov, 27 drones caused a fire at a gas distribution centre. Drones were also destroyed in Briansk, Astrac\u00e1n, Vor\u00f3nezh, Volgogrado, Kursk and B\u00e9lgorod, and the Afipski refinery was hit the night before. Crimea governor Sergu\u00e9i Aksi\u00f3nov admitted fuel shortages but said supply would normalize in two weeks. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that 97 of 115 drones launched by Russia were neutralised, including 17 that struck targets. In Odesa, a rail infrastructure damage was reported but train traffic resumed. In Zaporiyia, 9,000 users lost electricity, with 95\u202f% restored by dawn. In V\u00ednitsia, drones hit critical infrastructure, causing fires and damage to a residential building. In Dnipropetrovsk, a 39\u2011year\u2011old woman was injured in Pokrovska.

She noted that Russia was the first country to officially protest Patrice Lumumba\u2019s murder and that African nations can realise vast economic potential in a fair, multipolar world, saying, 'in a more just, more real, more multipolar world we have huge opportunities.'  The article then shifts to the ongoing Russia\u2011Ukraine conflict, reporting that Russian forces destroyed a Ukrainian unmanned craft off Crimea and that the Black Sea Fleet used \u2018Lanzet\u2019 anti\u2011ship munitions.  It cites a Telegram post from the Ministry of Defence that the targets were destroyed with small\u2011arms and \u2018Lanzet\u2019 munitions, and that the Russian navy also destroyed a Ukrainian drone\u2011boat on the same day.  The piece mentions a decision to limit non\u2011resident Russian citizens from transferring more than 1\u202fmillion\u202fUSD to foreign accounts, a restriction that will remain from 1\u202fOctober\u202f2025 to 31\u202fMarch\u202f2026.  It reports that Russia is a major supplier of gas, oil and refined products to Turkey, and that Turkish officials say it would be unprofitable to stop Russian supplies; the article quotes economist Igor Yushkov saying that a Turkish refusal would raise prices and benefit U.S. suppliers.  The article also covers U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for Turkey to drop Russian energy, the U.S. plan to double LNG exports, and the EU\u2019s accelerated ban on Russian LNG by 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2027.  In military news, Russian troops reportedly captured the village of Yunanovka in Sumy Oblast, destroying the \u2018live force and equipment\u2019 of several Ukrainian units, and Russian officials claim the capture disrupts Ukrainian logistics.  Finally, the article touches on political developments such as the EU\u2019s proposal for a \u20ac140\u202fbillion reparations loan to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, Belgium\u2019s criticism of the plan, and the Russian Ministry of Justice\u2019s new rules for social payments to mobilised personnel.

It claims that the GUR destroyed four Mi\u20118 helicopters, two Be\u201112 amphibious aircraft and the radar system \"Neblo\u2011U\" in Crimea, making the region more vulnerable and requiring additional resources. The piece also states that the SBU\u2019s Special Operations (SSO) finished an episode with a S\u2011400 surface\u2011to\u2011air missile system in Kaluga, destroying its launch platform and radar. \n\nThe article then details recent attacks: two production\u2011dispatch stations on the \"Transnft\u2011Druzhba\" pipeline in Bryansk and the \"Samara\" station on the \"Kuybyshev\u2011Tikhoretsk\" pipeline, both hit by SBU drones. It also reports a strike on the Astara gas\u2011processing plant, a major global petrochemical complex, with damage that could halt operations for at least a week. \n\nA further attack on the \"Gazprom Neftogaz Salavat\" plant in Bashkortostan is described as the second strike in ten days, reaching a distance of 1,400 km and producing a visible plume of black smoke. The article claims this demonstrates the SBU\u2019s ability to hit targets across Russia, from the Baltic to the Ural. \n\nThe piece concludes by stating that Russia has had to raise VAT to 22% to cover war costs, implying that the attacks have forced the country to divert resources from investment to defense. The tone is strongly critical of the Russian government, labeling it as \"destroying what was built by generations\". \n\nKey metrics cited: 4 Mi\u20118 helicopters, 2 Be\u201112 aircraft, 1,400 km attack range, 22% VAT increase, 2\u2011month timeframe for significant damage to the gas sector.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 03:40 PM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/ru/think/chto-demonstrirujut-dronovye-sanktsii-sbu-1080421.html)\n\n**Hungary Accuses EU of Failing to Uphold Energy Guarantees**\nOn September 26, 2025, Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 accused the European Union of failing to uphold its obligations to defend Hungary\u2019s interests after attacks on the Druzhba pipeline. He said Budapest received no guarantees from the EU or Kyiv following the attacks attributed to Ukraine, according to the daily *Magyar Nemzet*. Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 stated, 'La Comisi\u00f3n Europea no intervino, no se puso de nuestro lado ni se dirigi\u00f3 a Ucrania sobre este problema.' He reminded that the EU had previously stressed the critical importance of energy infrastructure for member states and that Hungary views the attacks as a direct assault on national sovereignty.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitri\u202fPeskow told journalists, 'Die verbleibende Leitung ist vorhanden, sie kann im Grunde genommen sofort gestartet werden'. The Nord\u202fStream system consists of two double pipelines, Nord\u202fStream\u202f1 and Nord\u202fStream\u202f2, running under the Baltic Sea. After the 2022 explosions, only one of the four lines\u2014part of Nord\u202fStream\u202f2\u2014remained intact, a fact that the article cites as a metric of the damage. German Chancellor Friedrich\u202fMerz said in May that preventing Nord\u202fStream\u202f2 from operating is part of efforts to pressure Russia into ending the war in Ukraine. Peskow said Russia hopes for a conclusion of the German\u2011led investigation into the attacks. A Ukrainian citizen was arrested in Italy last month on suspicion of involvement. Russia blames Kyiv, while the Ukraine denies any role. Both Moscow and the West describe the September\u202f26,\u202f2022 explosions as sabotage that disrupted a large portion of Russian gas deliveries to Europe. Peskow reiterated on Friday that the United States was partly responsible, saying, 'Wer hat das, sagen wir, gebilligt? ... es ist offensichtlich, dass solche Handlungen der Ukraine und des Kiewer Regimes ohne das Wissen der Regierung von (Joe) Biden in den USA unm\u00f6glich gewesen w\u00e4ren'.

The loss of this route has already pushed gas prices to an all\u2011time high and contributed to inflation across the continent. President Vladimir Putin said last week that there was no time left this year to sign a new Ukrainian gas transit deal, blaming Kyiv for refusing to extend the agreement. Gazprom reported a net loss of $7\u202fbillion in 2023, its first annual loss since 1999, largely due to the loss of EU gas markets. The only remaining Russian pipelines to Europe are Blue\u202fStream and TurkStream to Turkey; other routes such as Yamal\u2011Europe and Nord\u202fStream are closed. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean ordered preparations for the possible nationalisation of Moldovagaz, which is 50\u202f% owned by Gazprom, after the company announced it would suspend exports to Moldova from 0500\u202fGMT on 1\u202fJanuary because of unpaid debts. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said Slovakia would consider reciprocal measures against Ukraine if the gas transit stops, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Fico of opening a \u2018second energy front\u2019 against Ukraine on the orders of Russia. Gazprom plans to send 42.4\u202fmillion cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Monday, a volume in line with recent days, but it assumes no further gas will flow after 31\u202fDecember in its 2025 internal planning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[EurActiv.com](https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/russian-gas-flows-via-ukraine-for-last-day-as-transit-deal-crumbles/)\n\n**Ukraine tried to attack TurkStream infrastructure in Russia, Moscow says | Euractiv**\nRussia's defence ministry said that on Monday it shot down nine Ukrainian drones that were attempting to attack a compressor station on the TurkStream gas pipeline in the Krasnodar region. The facility remained operational and there were 'no casualties', and the drones caused 'minor damage' to a gas metering station, which emergency teams repaired quickly. TurkStream, which carries Russian gas to Turkey and Europe via Bulgaria, is one of Russia's last remaining pipeline routes after Ukraine refused to renew a five\u2011year transit deal earlier this year.

The attack was confirmed by Slovak authorities. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world\u2019s longest energy networks, carries crude oil over 4,000\u202fkm (2,485\u202fmiles) from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland. It runs through Ukraine and is the main route for Russian crude deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure; the most recent attacks on Druzhba occurred on August\u202f13 and August\u202f18. Kiev confirmed it fired drones at a key distribution station in Russia\u2019s Bryansk Region, threatening supplies to Hungary and Slovakia. Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said the transfers would stop while the damage is investigated. In addition, Ukrainian forces have attacked the TurkStream pipeline, which supplies natural gas to Turkey and several European countries, and earlier this year struck a gas metering station near Sudzha. Hungary, which has maintained a neutral stance and refuses to supply weapons to Kiev, has called for peace and criticized Western sanctions as ineffective.

Gas injection was carried out by all EU countries, except for Denmark and Belgium (gas withdrawal), Sweden and Portugal (no change). In Germany, UGS were filled to 50.66%, in France to 66.29%, in Austria to 64.74%, in Italy to 71.38% (earlier the largest Gazprom markets in Europe). Gas prices in Europe have risen to almost $430 per 1000 cubic meters. August gas futures on the TTF hub (Netherlands) on ICE Futures at 11:00 Moscow time on July 2, 2025, were trading at 34.25 euros/MW (427.55 dollars/1000 cubic meters), with a daily increase of 1.67% compared to the previous day's calculated price.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 08:58 AM\nSource:[\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/transport-and-storage/893084-gazovye-kotirovki-v-evrope-podskochili-pochti-do-430-doll-ssha-1000-m3/)\n\n**Over 1.1 billion cubic meters of gas delivered to European market through Turkish Stream pipeline in June 2025**\nAccording to ENTSOG, the physical flow of gas through the Stranja-2/Malkochlar gas metering station on the Turkish-Bulgarian border was 49.16 million cubic meters on June 30, 2025. Renominations for the same station increased to 50.66 million cubic meters on July 1. Since the beginning of 2025, gas pumping through the 2nd string of the Turkish Stream pipeline has been 7.77% higher than in the same period in 2024, with a total of 8.12 billion cubic meters delivered. In June 2025, 1.112 billion cubic meters of gas were delivered to the European market through the 2nd string of the Turkish Stream pipeline, which is 3.82% lower than in June 2024 and 19.67% lower than in May 2025. For the first six months of 2025, 8.127 billion cubic meters of gas were delivered through the Turkish Stream pipeline and its land extension to Europe, which is a 7.76% increase compared to January-June 2024. Compared to the same period in 2024, when Ukrainian transit was still in operation, deliveries decreased by 46.58%. Since January 1, 2025, transit of Russian gas to Europe through the Ukrainian gas transportation system has been completely stopped. 'Gazprom has been deprived of the technical and legal ability to supply gas for transit through Ukraine after the expiration of the transit contract and the inter-operator agreement, signed on December 30, 2019.' The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported on March 28, 2025, that the Sudzha gas metering station in the Kursk region was destroyed by a HIMARS rocket attack. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline was stopped on August 31, 2022, due to problems with gas pumping units (GPA) Siemens, and both of its strings were damaged on September 26, 2022, as a result of explosions in the Baltic Sea. The non-certified in the EU Nord Stream 2 pipeline suffered damage to one of its strings, while the other remained intact, with reduced pressure and formally ready for operation. Another route for Russian gas supplies to Europe, the Yamal-Europe pipeline, has been inaccessible to Gazprom since May 11, 2022, due to Russian counter-sanctions. The weather in Europe is hot, with the highest temperatures recorded in Portugal, Spain, France, western Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece. According to Meteoalarm, yellow-level warnings for high temperatures have been issued for Italy, the Czech Republic, Greece, North Macedonia, and Serbia. Orange-level warnings are displayed for Austria, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, and Israel, while red-level warnings are shown for France, Germany, and Croatia. In the coming days, hot weather will persist in Southern, Western, Central, and Southeastern Europe. Wind power generation in Europe is decreasing. According to WindEurope, on June 30, 2025, wind power accounted for 9.7% of the demand for electricity in Europe (17.9% earlier in the day). According to Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), on June 29, 2025, underground gas storage facilities (UGS) in the EU were filled to 58.59%, with 62.68 billion cubic meters of gas stored. The level of filling of UGS increased by 0.41 percentage points (0.4 percentage points earlier in the day).

The maintenance, which took place from June 10 to June 17, affected the receiving terminals and the Russkaya measuring station in Russia. Prior to the maintenance, Russian gas supplies via the European leg of TurkStream averaged around 46 million cubic metres per day on June 1-9. TurkStream remains the only pipeline carrying Russian gas to Europe after blasts stopped exports via the Nord Stream 1 pipelines in September 2022 and transit via Ukraine was halted on January 1, as stated by Entsog. 'No comment' was given by Russian state-owned gas exporter Gazprom when asked for a statement. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 10:50 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-14816567/Russia-slowly-restarts-gas-flows-Europe-TurkStream-maintenance-nears-completion.html)\n\n**Russian Gas Supplies to Europe Halted Through Ukraine's Gas Transportation System**\nRussian gas supplies to Europe are currently only being transported through the Turkish Stream pipeline, as transit through Ukraine's gas transportation system has been halted. According to Bulgartransgaz, a planned preventive repair of the Turkish Stream pipeline is being carried out from June 10 to 17. As of June 10, the physical gas flow at the Stranja-2/Malkochlar gas measurement station on the border of Turkey and Bulgaria was 44.42 million cubic meters. Renominations for the Stranja-2/Malkochlar gas measurement station on June 11 show that the Turkish Stream pipeline has been stopped for repair and shows 0 million cubic meters. Since the beginning of 2025, gas transportation through this route has been 13.33% higher than the same period in 2024, with 7.46 billion cubic meters of gas delivered. Since January 1, 2025, transit of Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine's gas transportation system has been completely halted. The transit of gas through the Sojavka gas measurement station (the point of entry into Ukraine from Russia through the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline) has been stopped since January 1, 2025. Gazprom has stated that it has been deprived of the technical and legal ability to supply gas for transit through Ukraine after the expiration of the transit contract and inter-operator agreement signed on December 30, 2019. It is worth noting that on March 28, 2025, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that the Sudzha gas measurement station in the Kursk region had been destroyed as a result of a HIMARS rocket attack. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline was stopped on August 31, 2022, due to problems with gas pumping units (GPAs) Siemens, and on September 26, 2022, both of its lines were damaged in explosions in the Baltic Sea. The non-certified in the EU Nord Stream 2 pipeline has suffered damage to one of its lines, while the other remains intact, with reduced pressure and formally ready for operation. Another route for Russian gas supplies to Europe, the Yamal-Europe pipeline, has been inaccessible to Gazprom since May 11, 2022, due to the introduction of Russian counter-sanctions. Weather, reserves, and gas prices in Europe The weather in Europe remains warm, with negative temperatures recorded in southern Norway. A heatwave has established itself in southern Spain, Italy, southwestern France, western Croatia, and Greece. The Meteoalarm service has issued yellow-level warnings for high temperatures in France, Italy, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and orange-level warnings for Israel. From June 14, an increase in temperature is expected in Spain, Italy, and France, as well as in western Croatia. Wind power generation in Europe has begun to recover. According to WindEurope, as of June 10, 2025, wind power accounted for 17.6% of the demand for electricity in Europe (14.5% the previous day). According to Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), as of June 9, 2025, underground gas storage facilities (UGS) in the EU were filled to 51.79%, with 55.4 billion cubic meters of gas stored. The level of filling of UGS increased by 0.38 percentage points (0.43 percentage points the previous day). Gas injection was carried out by all EU countries, except for Denmark (which was taking gas out), Sweden, and Portugal (where there was no change). In Germany, UGS were filled to 43.71%, in France to 59.45%, in Austria to 57.28%, and in Italy to 63.51% (previously the largest Gazprom markets in Europe). Gas prices in Europe are approaching $430 per 1000 cubic meters.

    "summary": "Forecasting experts across technical, economic, and geopolitical domains assess a heightened but not overwhelming risk that either the TurkStream or Blue Stream pipeline will unexpectedly cease transporting gas at some point in 2025. All experts underline several key drivers: (1) increasingly frequent and sophisticated Ukrainian drone/sabotage attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, with some explicit attempts against TurkStream compressor stations reported in 2025; (2) the criticality of these pipelines for Russian export revenue, Turkish energy security, and, for TurkStream, continued European gas supply, leading to strong political and economic incentives on all sides to protect, rapidly repair, and even obscure/mitigate interruptions; (3) the technical robustness and resilience of both pipeline systems, especially their offshore segments, which limits physical vulnerability to catastrophic sabotage versus overland or oil infrastructure; and (4) the low, but rising, historical base rates for major gas pipeline outages outside of maintenance or scheduled contractual pauses. Most forecasters believe that while the probability is significantly elevated above historic norms (owing to the war environment and new attack precedents, e.g. Nord Stream, Druzhba), it remains below 50%, due to the combination of defense, rapid restoration capabilities, and the extremely high threshold for all parties to accept an unplanned stoppage. The average probability provided across perspectives is roughly 29%, with individual expert estimates ranging from 17% (emphasizing technical/maintenance resilience) to 62% (highlighting elevated sabotage trends). All agree that the question could resolve Yes with even a brief, well-documented, and truly unexpected halt from an attack or accident. Overall, there is consensus that the risk\u2014while no longer negligible\u2014is not the dominant scenario, reflecting both the advances in offensive capability and the enduring strength of defensive operations and mutual interests in stability.",
