The Gen-Z movement\u2019s influence was decisive in toppling the previous government but is showing signs of internal division. Ghising\u2019s lack of a party base and parliamentary seat, coupled with constitutional and elite coalition constraints, make it highly unlikely he will be named the next non-caretaker PM. Historical base rates for technocrats or caretaker ministers ascending to full PM in Nepal are extremely low. The only plausible scenario for a \u2018Yes\u2019 outcome is an extraordinary and sustained realignment, which current news does not indicate is imminent.

The Gen-Z movement is a disruptive force, but unless it transforms into a powerful parliamentary bloc or forges a cross-party consensus, Ghising\u2019s path to the premiership is highly uncertain. Base rates for technocrats ascending to the premiership in Nepal are near zero; even during times of crisis, caretaker appointments have not translated into full mandates. However, the current volatility and Ghising\u2019s unique popularity provide a non-negligible chance\u2014higher than in ordinary times\u2014that an outsider could be elevated if the elite are paralyzed and public pressure remains extreme.

The Gen-Z movement's disruptive force is undeniable, but unless it converts into a durable electoral bloc or Ghising suddenly becomes the rallying figure for a real parliamentary coalition, this is all theoretical. The Nepali system is built to absorb shocks and then return power to those with actual seats, party infrastructure, and coalition-making ability. You cite 'non-negligible' outsider odds due to volatility, but the evidence doesn\u2019t support such a bump\u2014Ghising\u2019s appointment to a powerful ministry is already the system\u2019s way of appeasing protestors without ceding real power. The base rate for technocrats becoming PM in Nepal is so close to zero that 7% is still a soft overstatement."

The new ministers\u2014Kalman Gurung as energy minister, Rameshore Khanal as finance minister, and Om Prakash Aryal as home minister\u2014were sworn in outside a government building that had been attacked and set ablaze by protesters the week before.  The appointments come after violent demonstrations sparked by a brief social media ban and widespread anger over corruption that resulted in at least 72 deaths and hundreds of injuries, leading to the collapse of the previous administration.  Karki, 73, who was appointed on September\u202f12, took office following an agreement with leaders of the largely youth\u2011led \u2018Gen\u202fZ\u2019 protest movement.  The military, which enforced a curfew during the unrest, ultimately consented to her leadership of a caretaker government charged with overseeing elections within six months.  At a conference on Sunday, Karki stated, 'What we need now is to work to end corruption, bring about good governance, and achieve economic equality. This is what the people truly desire at this moment.'  Businessman Shrawan Dahl expressed confidence in her ability to lead, saying, 'Her objective is to conduct the election, and we hope she will accomplish this task successfully.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 03:28 PM\nSource:[Africanews](https://www.africanews.com/2025/09/15/nepals-interim-pm-appoints-cabinet-amid-post-protest-recovery/)\n\n**Nepal's PM Karki appoints ministers after deadly Gen Z protests**\nNeal's Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the country\u2019s first female leader, appointed Om Prakash Aryal as home minister, Rameshwar Prasad Khanal as finance minister, and Kulman Ghising as energy minister on Monday, following the dissolution of parliament after deadly protests that killed at least 72 people. Aryal is a human\u2011rights lawyer, Khanal a former finance secretary who recommended major economic reforms, and Ghising a former state power utility chief credited with eliminating load\u2011shedding. President Ramchandra Paudel swore them in during a televised ceremony outside the fire\u2011damaged presidential office. The interim government, which will last six months until early\u2011March elections, is pledged to tackle corruption. The appointments came less than a week after former PM KP Sharma Oli resigned amid unrest that escalated when demonstrators were shot dead by police on Monday. The protests, led by Gen\u202fZ, began on 8\u202fSeptember over a brief social\u2011media ban and grew into widespread anger over corruption and poverty. In her first public remarks, Karki said the country should rebuild together and would work 'according to the thinking of the Gen\u202fZ generation'. Subash Dhakal, a 19\u2011year\u2011old protester shot in the knees, told AFP he had no regrets and that the pain was temporary but would bring change.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 12:46 PM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/15/nepals-pm-karki-appoints-ministers-after-deadly-gen-z-protests)\n\n**Nepal PM Sushila Karki appoints three new ministers for interim cabinet**\nOn September 15 2025, the Hindustan Times reported that Nepal President Ramchandra Paudel swore in three ministers\u2014Kulman Ghising, Rameshwor Khanal and Om Prakash Aryal\u2014appointed by caretaker Prime Minister Sushila Karki for her newly formed cabinet. The oath ceremony took place at the President's Office, Sheetal Niwas, Maharajgunj, after which all three ministers immediately assumed their posts. Khanal, the former finance secretary, was sworn in as finance minister. Ghising, the former managing director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, was given charge of energy, water resources and irrigation; physical infrastructure and transport; and urban development. Aryal, an advocate, was appointed minister for home affairs and for law, justice and parliamentary affairs. The article notes that Karki, 73, became Nepal's first female prime minister on September 12, at the recommendation of the agitating 'Gen Z' group, to lead a caretaker government tasked with conducting fresh elections on March 5 2026.

The meeting considered several potential leaders: Kathmandu Mayor Balenndra\u202fShah, former Chief Justice Shushila\u202fKarki (who said 'I am ready to lead the interim government if I have unanimous support'), Sumana\u202fShrestha (who declined due to her affiliation with the Rastriya\u202fSwatantra\u202fParty), Harka\u202fSamparg (Mayor of Dharan), Sagar\u202fDhakal (federal election candidate), Kulman\u202fGhising (former Managing Director of Nepal Electricity Authority), and Rastra\u202fBimochan\u202fTimalsena (YouTuber and lawyer who goes by 'Random Nepali').\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 12:05 PM\nSource:[thestatesman.com](https://www.thestatesman.com/world/after-olis-exit-who-will-lead-nepal-inside-details-of-genz-meeting-on-interim-government-1503484209.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All eight expert forecasters agree that the probability of Kulman Ghising becoming the next non-caretaker prime minister of Nepal is quite low\u2014ranging from 3% to 10%, with most clustered between 5% and 7%. Their consensus is grounded in several recurring themes: (1) The status quo is a caretaker government led by Sushila Karki, with Ghising serving as a high-profile technocratic minister; (2) Nepal\u2019s parliamentary system, historical precedent, and party-centric coalition politics overwhelmingly favor established party leaders or traditional politicians for the post of non-caretaker PM, especially following elections; (3) While Ghising enjoys significant popularity, particularly among Gen-Z protestors and civil society for his technocratic achievements, he lacks a political base or an electoral coalition strong enough to secure him the premiership through standard parliamentary procedures; (4) The influence of the Gen-Z protest movement and recent political volatility has slightly increased the theoretical possibilities for outsiders or technocrats, but experts still judge that without extreme deadlock, further crises, or unprecedented consensus among parties, Ghising\u2019s ascent remains highly improbable; (5) All experts cite exceptionally low historical base rates for technocrats or non-party figures becoming prime minister after Nepalese caretaker periods and following mass protest transitions. In summary, while Ghising\u2019s unique profile and recent mass mobilization create a nonzero chance\u2014particularly should another major crisis provide an opening for a unity or compromise figure\u2014the strong structural constraints of Nepal\u2019s political system make it very unlikely he will be the next non-caretaker PM within the specified window.",
