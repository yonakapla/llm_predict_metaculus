Macro headwinds (tariffs, interest rates) are already known and largely priced in, and tech firms are actively mitigating these risks (e.g., Apple\u2019s investments to avoid tariffs). Energy price shocks could boost Aramco, but barring a geopolitical crisis or OPEC-driven super-spike, this is unlikely to suffice.

While I agree that a complete reshuffling in 2.5 months is highly unlikely, your forecast would be stronger if you acknowledged that digital transformation, by making market value more contingent on future expectations, can actually make the sector more\u2014not less\u2014vulnerable to sudden corrections. Don't let the narrative of unstoppable AI/cloud growth lull you into ignoring tail risk: the same forces that drive exponential upside can, under the right conditions, snap back with breathtaking speed."

Bank of America\u2019s chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett notes that the Magnificent 7 tech stocks\u2014Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia\u2014have risen 225% since March 2023 and trade at 39 times trailing 12\u2011month earnings, while historical bubbles typically reach 244% gains and 58 times earnings. DataTrek\u2019s Jessica Rabe adds that, when Tesla is replaced by Broadcom, the group\u2019s earnings estimates grew 4.2% on average for the fourth quarter and 6.1% for the full year 2026, compared with only 0.8% and 1.4% for the S&P\u202f500, explaining why the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has doubled the S&P\u202f500\u2019s performance over the past three months. Rabe writes, 'These strong fundamentals should enable U.S. big tech to drive the S&P higher through year\u2011end and also supports their (and the index's) elevated valuations.' Wells Fargo\u2019s Ohsung Kwon describes AI spending as still in the 'early innings' and projects the S&P\u202f500 will hit 7,200 by the end of 2026, noting that AI capex is a key tailwind. Kwon writes, '[The] music stops when the AI capex stops,' and urges investors to 'Enjoy the party.' The piece also highlights a recent Federal Reserve rate cut and cites Evercore ISI\u2019s Julian Emanuel, who says the Nasdaq Composite gains 13.6% in the 12 months after such cuts, and recommends buying dips while avoiding greed and fear. Overall, the article presents a data\u2011driven, bullish view of the tech sector, framing the current rally as a bubble that is likely to continue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 04:22 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/5-reasons-the-new-tech-bubble-is-only-getting-started-11758514765849.html)\n\n**AI Changes History and Value; From FAANG to the Seven Magnifics**\nThe article explains how technology and artificial intelligence (AI) have reshaped the stock market over the past decade. It highlights the \"Seven Magnifics\"\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla\u2014as the current leaders in U.S. market capitalization, with a combined value of 20.668 trillion dollars. The piece notes that this figure is close to the U.S. GDP of 29.2 trillion dollars (World Bank, 2024) and exceeds the market caps of China (18.7T), Germany (4.7T), Japan (4.1T), and India (3.9T). In 2013 the FAANG group (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google/Alphabet) had a combined cap of just over 1 trillion dollars. The Seven now account for roughly 37% of the S&P 500\u2019s total capitalization, up from 17% a decade earlier. Analysts Eduardo Ramos and Felipe Mendoza attribute this shift to the digital revolution, cloud computing, AI, electrification, and a decade of cheap money (2011\u20112021). The article quotes Ramos: 'Hace diez a\u00f1os, las FAANG estaban emergiendo como gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos, el grupo representaba una porci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a del mercado burs\u00e1til de Estados Unidos...' and Mendoza: 'En la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, el paso de las FAANG a las Siete Magn\u00edficas ha mostrado un cambio estructural en la econom\u00eda digital y en los motores de crecimiento del mercado global...'.

Nvidia, with a market capitalization exceeding 3.85\u202ftrillion\u202fUSD, has surpassed Apple (3.06\u202ftrillion) and Microsoft (3.7\u202ftrillion). Economists say Nvidia\u2019s stock value reflects a global bet on artificial intelligence as the new productivity backbone. Microsoft plans to double its data\u2011center capacity in Europe before 2027 and has committed 2.9\u202fbillion\u202fUSD to AI infrastructure in Japan. Apple is investing more than 12\u202fbillion\u202fUSD in AI\u2011startup acquisitions and has created an internal team, AKI, to embed advanced AI in future iPhones. In Spain, Banco Santander and Iberdrola have reached market caps above 100\u202fbillion\u202fUSD, while CaixaBank is valued at 50\u202fbillion\u202fUSD, yet they remain far behind U.S. multinationals. The Ukraine war has disrupted the semiconductor supply chain, raising prices of neon, palladium and nickel. Under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, tariffs up to 100\u202f% were re\u2011introduced on companies that do not produce locally; Apple secured an exemption after pledging 600\u202fbillion\u202fUSD of investment in the U.S., whereas Nvidia and AMD must pay 15\u202f% of their China\u2011derived revenue to the U.S. government to continue exporting. The U.S.\u2013China rivalry centers on AI, telecommunications and semiconductors, with the U.S. backing Google, Apple and Microsoft and China promoting Huawei, Tencent and Alibaba. The strategies of the leading tech multinationals focus on infrastructure investment, AI dominance and privileged access to decision centers, while large Spanish and European listings adopt defensive tactics of stability, dividends and regional solidity.

According to average Wall Street price targets from Yahoo! Finance, Microsoft has a projected upside of 20.1% from its current price, which is higher than the upside implied for its peers.  The author attributes Microsoft\u2019s strength to an AI\u2011driven cloud tailwind: Azure\u2019s growth has accelerated thanks to demand for AI services, Microsoft\u2019s entrenched ecosystem of operating systems and productivity tools, and its partnership with OpenAI\u2019s large\u2011language model.  The article cites that in the fourth quarter of fiscal year\u202f2025 Microsoft recorded commercial bookings of $100\u202fbillion, a 37\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year increase, and ended the year with a $368\u202fbillion backlog against $281.7\u202fbillion in trailing\u201112\u2011month revenue.

DataTrek\u2019s Jessica Rabe adds that, when Tesla is replaced by Broadcom, the group\u2019s earnings estimates grew 4.2% on average for the fourth quarter and 6.1% for the full year 2026, compared with only 0.8% and 1.4% for the S&P\u202f500, explaining why the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has doubled the S&P\u202f500\u2019s performance over the past three months. Rabe writes, 'These strong fundamentals should enable U.S. big tech to drive the S&P higher through year\u2011end and also supports their (and the index's) elevated valuations.' Wells Fargo\u2019s Ohsung Kwon describes AI spending as still in the 'early innings' and projects the S&P\u202f500 will hit 7,200 by the end of 2026, noting that AI capex is a key tailwind. Kwon writes, '[The] music stops when the AI capex stops,' and urges investors to 'Enjoy the party.' The piece also highlights a recent Federal Reserve rate cut and cites Evercore ISI\u2019s Julian Emanuel, who says the Nasdaq Composite gains 13.6% in the 12 months after such cuts, and recommends buying dips while avoiding greed and fear. Overall, the article presents a data\u2011driven, bullish view of the tech sector, framing the current rally as a bubble that is likely to continue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 04:22 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/5-reasons-the-new-tech-bubble-is-only-getting-started-11758514765849.html)\n\n**AI Changes History and Value; From FAANG to the Seven Magnifics**\nThe article explains how technology and artificial intelligence (AI) have reshaped the stock market over the past decade. It highlights the \"Seven Magnifics\"\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla\u2014as the current leaders in U.S. market capitalization, with a combined value of 20.668 trillion dollars. The piece notes that this figure is close to the U.S. GDP of 29.2 trillion dollars (World Bank, 2024) and exceeds the market caps of China (18.7T), Germany (4.7T), Japan (4.1T), and India (3.9T). In 2013 the FAANG group (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google/Alphabet) had a combined cap of just over 1 trillion dollars. The Seven now account for roughly 37% of the S&P 500\u2019s total capitalization, up from 17% a decade earlier. Analysts Eduardo Ramos and Felipe Mendoza attribute this shift to the digital revolution, cloud computing, AI, electrification, and a decade of cheap money (2011\u20112021). The article quotes Ramos: 'Hace diez a\u00f1os, las FAANG estaban emergiendo como gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos, el grupo representaba una porci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a del mercado burs\u00e1til de Estados Unidos...' and Mendoza: 'En la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, el paso de las FAANG a las Siete Magn\u00edficas ha mostrado un cambio estructural en la econom\u00eda digital y en los motores de crecimiento del mercado global...'. NVIDIA leads the list with a market cap of 4.293 trillion dollars, followed by Microsoft (3.850T), Apple (3.643T), Alphabet (3.083T), Amazon (2.469T), Meta (1.995T), and Tesla (1.374T).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:36 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/mercados/ia-cambia-historia-valor-faang-siete-magnificas-20250921-778118.html)\n\n**Tech Giants Redefine Global Economy with Record Valuations and AI Expansion**\nThe article describes how major technology companies are reshaping the global economy with record valuations and disruptive expansion. Nvidia, with a market capitalization exceeding 3.85\u202ftrillion\u202fUSD, has surpassed Apple (3.06\u202ftrillion) and Microsoft (3.7\u202ftrillion). Economists say Nvidia\u2019s stock value reflects a global bet on artificial intelligence as the new productivity backbone. Microsoft plans to double its data\u2011center capacity in Europe before 2027 and has committed 2.9\u202fbillion\u202fUSD to AI infrastructure in Japan. Apple is investing more than 12\u202fbillion\u202fUSD in AI\u2011startup acquisitions and has created an internal team, AKI, to embed advanced AI in future iPhones. In Spain, Banco Santander and Iberdrola have reached market caps above 100\u202fbillion\u202fUSD, while CaixaBank is valued at 50\u202fbillion\u202fUSD, yet they remain far behind U.S. multinationals. The Ukraine war has disrupted the semiconductor supply chain, raising prices of neon, palladium and nickel. Under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, tariffs up to 100\u202f% were re\u2011introduced on companies that do not produce locally; Apple secured an exemption after pledging 600\u202fbillion\u202fUSD of investment in the U.S., whereas Nvidia and AMD must pay 15\u202f% of their China\u2011derived revenue to the U.S. government to continue exporting. The U.S.\u2013China rivalry centers on AI, telecommunications and semiconductors, with the U.S. backing Google, Apple and Microsoft and China promoting Huawei, Tencent and Alibaba. The strategies of the leading tech multinationals focus on infrastructure investment, AI dominance and privileged access to decision centers, while large Spanish and European listings adopt defensive tactics of stability, dividends and regional solidity. The article quotes: 'Nvidia ha pasado de ser un fabricante de tarjetas gr\u00e1ficas a convertirse en el coraz\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gico de la revoluci\u00f3n de la inteligencia artificial.' and 'Apple logr\u00f3 una exenci\u00f3n tras comprometerse a invertir 600.000 millones en el pa\u00eds.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[latribunadetoledo.es](https://www.latribunadetoledo.es/noticia/zfdd48fdb-0f8c-4f9a-8bfbb2212cac08d1/202509/las-tecnologicas-marcan-el-paso-del-crecimiento)\n\n**Top Technology Stocks To Follow Today - September 19th**\nMarketBeat\u2019s stock screener highlighted seven technology stocks\u2014NVIDIA, Apple, Palantir Technologies, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Broadcom, and Alphabet\u2014as the top picks to monitor on September\u202f19,\u202f2025. The article explains that these companies, whose core businesses span software, hardware, semiconductors, and internet platforms, are viewed as growth\u2011oriented assets that typically reinvest earnings into innovation and expansion. It notes that they had the highest dollar trading volume among technology stocks in recent days, indicating strong investor interest. The piece briefly outlines each company\u2019s main product lines and market segments: NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce GPUs, automotive platforms and Omniverse software; Apple\u2019s iPhone, Mac, iPad and wearables; Palantir\u2019s commercial and government software platforms; Microsoft\u2019s Office 365, Teams and other productivity services; Meta\u2019s Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp; Broadcom\u2019s semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software; and Alphabet\u2019s Google services, cloud and other bets.

It notes that Trump\u2011era tariffs, which generated roughly 20\u202ftrillion yen in revenue by the end of July, could become permanent, creating a long\u2011term risk for investors. Meanwhile, U.S. policy makers are expected to begin cutting rates after September, with the Fed\u2019s policy rate likely falling from 4.25\u20134.5\u202f% to 3.75\u20134.00\u202f% by year\u2011end, a scenario that the CME\u2019s FedWatch shows a 48\u202f% probability of by September\u202f1.\n\nThe S&P\u202f500\u2019s 90\u202f% of constituents reported Q2 earnings in fiscal 2025, with EPS up 11\u201312\u202f% YoY\u2014well above the 3\u202f% forecast\u2014supporting further upside. The \"Magnificent\u202f7\" (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, NVIDIA, Tesla) dominated the rally. NVIDIA\u2019s market cap already exceeds 600\u202ftrillion yen and could reach 1\u202fquadrillion yen by 2030, dwarfing Japan\u2019s nominal GDP (~600\u202ftrillion yen) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime market cap (~1\u202fquadrillion yen).\n\nHowever, the article warns that the S&P\u202f500\u2019s heavy reliance on M7 growth creates a \"mega\u2011cap dependence\" risk. If AI\u2011related growth slows, the market could wobble sharply, underscoring the importance of diversifying into other sectors and small\u2011cap stocks such as the Russell\u202f2000. IPO markets will benefit from global liquidity flowing into equities, but will also face the challenge of Japan\u2019s Bank of Japan tightening policy\u2014expecting a 0.25\u202f% rate hike by March\u202f2026, with a 70\u202f% probability by December\u202f2025.\n\nIn August, the IPO spotlight falls on space\u2011tech firm Accel Space Holdings, whose end\u2011to\u2011end satellite services span agriculture, environmental monitoring, and disaster prevention.\n\nOverall, the late\u20112025 market is a tug\u2011of\u2011war between rate\u2011cut momentum and tariff\u2011cost headwinds, making IPOs of sustainably growing companies especially attractive.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 08:17 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB183Z50Y5A910C2000000/)\n\n**One Big Beautiful Bubble: Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta Platforms, Palantir et al in the danger zone?**\nOracle Corporation\u2019s shares surged 36\u202f% on September\u202f10, adding about $255\u202fbillion to its market\u2011cap \u2013 the first time a single\u2011day jump has exceeded $250\u202fbillion, joining the ranks of Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft.  The rally followed the release of Q1\u202fFY26 results, where net profit met expectations but revenue slightly missed; the real driver was Oracle\u2019s announced plan to grow its cloud\u2011infrastructure revenue 14\u2011fold to $144\u202fbillion by FY30 \u2013 a compounded annual growth rate of 70\u202f%.  Oracle\u2019s order backlog (RPO) rose to $455\u202fbillion, up 359\u202f% YoY and 230\u202f% QoQ, with a projected $500\u202fbillion in the next few months.  The cloud\u2011infrastructure segment now accounts for 17\u202f% of total revenue (FY25 $57.4\u202fbillion) and has delivered 51\u202f% constant\u2011currency growth, compared with 2.5\u202f% for other verticals.  The company\u2019s $300\u202fbillion deal with OpenAI, a cash\u2011burning start\u2011up, raises concentration risk, as the bulk of the RPO is tied to a single client.  Oracle\u2019s trailing PE was 54\u00d7 before the jump and 69\u00d7 on September\u202f19, far above its 5\u2011year average.  The article notes that the S&P\u202f500\u2019s market\u2011cap grew $31\u202ftrillion since 2020, while the top 10 AI stocks added $18\u202ftrillion \u2013 60\u202f% of the index\u2019s gains \u2013 and that the Big\u202f5 (Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Oracle) spent $586\u202fbillion on capex in the last three fiscal years and are projected to spend $860\u202fbillion in the next two.  Tech capex now contributes 0.8\u202f% of GDP, surpassing personal consumption expenditure for the first time since 2022.  The piece warns that valuations of AI stocks are high (most trade above 5\u2011year P/E averages) and that the current market\u2011cap\u2011to\u2011GDP ratio of 2\u00d7 is worse than the 1.3\u00d7 seen in March\u202f2000, suggesting a bubble reminiscent of the dot\u2011com crash.  \"Valuations often matter suddenly, and with a vengeance,\" quotes John\u202fHussman, underscoring the risk of a correction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 03:42 PM\nSource:[@businessline](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/big-story/one-big-beautiful-bubble-oracle-amazon-microsoft-google-meta-platforms-palantir-et-al-in-the-danger-zone/article70070297.ece)\n\n**AI Fever: Boom or Excess?**\nThe article tracks the rapid rise of artificial\u2011intelligence (AI) companies and the resulting market frenzy, noting that since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 the tech sector has seen sustained growth.

Alphabet\u2019s market capitalization crossed US$3\u202fbillion, joining Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, driven by increased demand for AI\u2011powered products.  Nvidia\u2019s shares trade at more than 30 times projected earnings, a figure that signals potential overvaluation.  The U.S. equity market added US$21\u202fbillion in 2022, with ten AI firms accounting for over half of that gain, and a third of Western venture capital flowed into AI.  A MIT study found that 95% of companies report zero return from generative AI.

According to average Wall Street price targets from Yahoo! Finance, Microsoft has a projected upside of 20.1% from its current price, which is higher than the upside implied for its peers.  The author attributes Microsoft\u2019s strength to an AI\u2011driven cloud tailwind: Azure\u2019s growth has accelerated thanks to demand for AI services, Microsoft\u2019s entrenched ecosystem of operating systems and productivity tools, and its partnership with OpenAI\u2019s large\u2011language model.  The article cites that in the fourth quarter of fiscal year\u202f2025 Microsoft recorded commercial bookings of $100\u202fbillion, a 37\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year increase, and ended the year with a $368\u202fbillion backlog against $281.7\u202fbillion in trailing\u201112\u2011month revenue.

Nvidia (NVDC34) leads the list with a market value of US$ 3,446 trillion, driven by explosive growth in the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors, with a US$ 157 billion increase in the year. Microsoft (MSFT34) follows closely, with a market value of US$ 3,441 trillion, thanks to its strong performance in cloud services, AI, and corporate software. Apple (AAPL34), which started the year as the most valuable company with US$ 3,785 trillion, has dropped to third place with a market value of US$ 3,036 trillion, reflecting competitive challenges and sector adjustments. Other notable companies include Amazon (AMZO34) with US$ 2,184 trillion, Alphabet (GOGL34) with US$ 2,059 trillion, Meta Platforms (M1TA34) with US$ 1,677 trillion, and Tesla (TSLA34) with US$ 1,109 trillion.

    "summary": "All eight experts forecast a very high probability that the world\u2019s five largest companies at the end of 2025 will be in the tech sector, with probability estimates tightly clustered between 88% and 93%. The experts agree that as of October 2025, the global top five by market capitalization (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon) are all unmistakably classified as technology companies, while Saudi Aramco (energy) ranks sixth and trails the fifth tech firm by a substantial margin. Multiple perspectives (financial analysis, technology industry, economics, business theory, and sociology) converge on several key arguments: (1) AI-driven growth, cloud investment, and persistent platform/network effects offer strong fundamental support for tech valuations; (2) historical base rates since 2020 consistently show tech\u2019s dominance in the top five spots, with few exceptions only during brief oil price surges; and (3) the time remaining to question resolution (~2.5 months) is too short for a major reshuffling to be likely absent a severe market event. The primary risk to a 'Yes' outcome is a sudden, sharp correction in the tech sector, sparked by overvaluation, earnings disappointment, regulatory shocks, or a commodity (oil) price surge boosting non-tech challengers like Saudi Aramco. However, most experts believe such an event is unlikely to materialize with sufficient speed and magnitude before year-end, given tech\u2019s large valuation buffer, investor optimism, and persistent sectoral momentum. Base rates, structural trends (AI/platform dominance), and institutional inertia all reinforce tech\u2019s entrenched position. Residual uncertainty (7\u201312%) is attributed mainly to the possibility of a late-breaking bubble collapse or extraordinary geopolitical shock, but, overall, the consensus is overwhelming for a continued all-tech top five through December 2025.",
