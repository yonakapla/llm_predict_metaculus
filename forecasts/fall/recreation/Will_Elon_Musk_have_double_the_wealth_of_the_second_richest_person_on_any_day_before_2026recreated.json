If successful, the company\u2019s valuation could rise to roughly $500\u202fbillion, putting it in the same league as SpaceX and OpenAI. The stablecoin issued by Tether currently has a circulating market cap of $172\u202fbillion, just behind Circle\u2019s USDC at $74\u202fbillion. Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates that a $500\u202fbillion valuation would boost chairman D'Vasi\u2019s net worth to $224\u202fbillion, making him the world\u2019s fifth\u2011richest person after Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos. CEO Ardoino and former CEO Fang Junzhe would each be close to $95\u202fbillion, entering the global top\u201120 richest list. Fang Junzhe, described as a \u2018Taiwanese son\u2011in\u2011law\u2019, is Dutch, studied Chinese at National Taiwan Normal University, and is the CEO of Bitfinex, a sister company of Tether under iFinex. He is known for visiting a Taiwanese temple each Lunar New Year, a practice that has drawn attention from fellow devotees.

If achieved, the chairman Giancarlo Devasini would become the world\u2019s fifth\u2011richest person with an estimated net worth of US$224\u202fbillion, surpassing figures for Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and even Warren Buffett. The former CEO Jean\u2011Louis Van der Velde, known as the \"Taiwan son\u2011in\u2011law\", would join the global top\u201120 with an estimated worth of about US$95\u202fbillion (\u2248NT$2.89\u202ftrillion). Paolo Ardoino, the current CEO, would also reach a similar level of wealth. Another shareholder, Stuart Hoegner, would see his net worth exceed US$60\u202fbillion. The deal would represent one of the most striking wealth\u2011accumulation cases in the crypto sector, eclipsing the current richest crypto exchange founder Zhao Changpeng, whose net worth is US$52\u202fbillion.

However, his lead is narrowing as Larry Ellison, the 81-year-old founder of Oracle, is now closing in on him. Ellison's personal wealth has increased by $100 billion since January, largely due to the surge in Oracle's stock price (+50% since the beginning of the year), driven by the growth of cloud and artificial intelligence. Ellison still owns 41% of Oracle's capital. Meanwhile, Elon Musk has lost $57 billion, mainly due to the decline in Tesla's stock price. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, completes the top three, while Jeff Bezos falls to fourth place. Bernard Arnault, the first Frenchman in the ranking, is now ninth with $157 billion.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 19, 2025 07:09 PM\nSource:[Europe 1](https://www.europe1.fr/international/elon-musk-reste-lhomme-le-plus-riche-du-monde-mais-pour-combien-de-temps-encore-769505)\n\n**Elon Musk Tops List of World's Richest People with $372 Billion Net Worth**\nAccording to the Bloomberg list of billionaires, as of August 17, 2025, Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has topped the list with a net worth of $372 billion.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014finance, economics, wealth management, and business strategy\u2014the consensus is that the probability of Elon Musk having double the wealth of the second-richest person on any day before 2026 is extremely low, generally estimated at 1\u20133%. Experts unanimously cite the historical rarity of such occurrences (last seen briefly with Bill Gates in 1999), the current magnitude of wealth gaps (Musk\u2019s wealth is substantial but not approaching double), and high correlations among top fortunes (primarily tech-related) as key limiting factors. While extreme volatility in tech stocks and possible idiosyncratic events (e.g., massive Tesla/SpaceX rally, major rival collapse, black swan incident) could, in theory, create a 2x gap, the likelihood remains minuscule given that assets at the top tend to rise and fall together. Further, recent surges by other billionaires (Ellison/Oracle, Zuckerberg/Meta) and potential new entrants from crypto (e.g., Tether) make it harder, not easier, for Musk to achieve this milestone. Short time remaining (2.5 months to 2026) further decreases the odds. Therefore, while a black swan scenario cannot be entirely ruled out, the overwhelming expert opinion is that it will not happen before 2026.",
