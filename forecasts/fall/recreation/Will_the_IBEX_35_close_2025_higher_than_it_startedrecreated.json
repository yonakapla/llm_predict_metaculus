The technical analysis critique argues for even higher odds given the historic rarity of the required drop, and I find this compelling in the absence of any new negative catalyst.

The technical analyst\u2019s critique of excess caution is well-taken, but the professional risk manager\u2019s insistence on not going all the way to 99% keeps me grounded.

However, even their arguments acknowledge that only an unprecedented, near-apocalyptic event could cause a >24% drawdown in the remaining 3.5 months. My own critique of overreliance on technicals reinforces that, while tail risks exist, the current macro, policy, and market environment are overwhelmingly supportive.

No new arguments or evidence have surfaced that would suggest a higher risk of a catastrophic reversal; in fact, the convergence of quantitative, behavioral, and macro/sectoral perspectives reinforces the original reasoning. The only credible risk remains a truly extraordinary, unpredictable global event. Given this, I see no justification for lowering my initial probability, and while an argument could be made for increasing it to 99% in line with some peers, the difference between 98% and 99% is marginal and both reflect essentially the same risk profile.

The only substantial pushback against a 99%+ probability is the call for humility about unpredictable tail risks, especially in the context of EU integration and sovereign debt history. While this is a valid reminder not to become overconfident, the magnitude and time horizon required for a 'No' outcome still make such a scenario exceedingly unlikely.

The Euro\u202fStoxx\u202f50, CAC\u202f40, DAX and STOXX\u202fEurope\u202f600 are holding near their August\u202f2024 lows: 5,155; 7,523; 23,380; and 534, respectively.  The Ibex\u202f35, buoyed by Inditex\u2019s strong results, continues to widen its gap with peers but is still far from its 2007 peak of 16,040.  In contrast, Wall Street\u2019s major indices are at record highs; the SOX semiconductor index has surpassed July\u2011last\u2011year highs, eliminating earlier bearish divergences.  Oil prices have reached new all\u2011time highs, even as the market remains weak on pricing.  European chip makers show a clear upward trend above \u20ac709, while Bitcoin is restructuring above the $110,000 support level, targeting mid\u2011August highs near $125,000.  The piece notes that geopolitical events \u2013 such as Russian drones violating Polish airspace and the fall of the French government \u2013 have not shaken markets, with the euro/dollar acting as a thermometer for geopolitical tensions.

The index fell 0.09\u202f% on Friday, losing about 13 points from the previous day. During the day, Banco Sabadell\u2019s board unanimously rejected BBVA\u2019s takeover offer, saying the price 'no recoge adecuadamente' the intrinsic value of Sabadell shares, 'infravalorando muy significativamente' the entity\u2019s project. Indra and Oes\u00eda declined talks over a possible acquisition worth about 500\u202fmillion euros by the company led by \u00c1ngel Escribano. Spain\u2019s CPI remained at 2.7\u202f% YoY in August, with food and electricity prices offsetting fuel costs, according to INE. The UK GDP in July stagnated compared with June, with 0.4\u202f% growth month\u2011on\u2011month and 1.4\u202f% YoY.

The market is still reacting to the European Central Bank\u2019s decision made the previous day. Investors are also watching Spanish banks: BBVA and Banco Sabadell have been in the news because Sabadell\u2019s board, chaired by Josep Oliu, unanimously rejected the takeover offer from Carlos Torres\u2019s firm, saying the price does not \"adequately\" reflect the intrinsic value of its shares and undervalues the project \"very significantly\".

On the macro side, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) held its year\u2011on\u2011year rate at 2.7% in August, as food and electricity prices offset fuel price increases, according to final data from the National Statistics Institute (INE).

The index recently broke the 15\u202f180\u2011point resistance, a key level that could open the door to a year\u2011high target of 15\u202f444 points.  Analyst Joan\u202fCabrero of elEconomista.es notes that the current bullish momentum has not fundamentally changed; he expects a market \u201csusto\u201d or correction that would bring the Ibex back to a fertile buying zone.  Cabrero estimates that a decline of 8\u201110\u202f% from the 15\u202f444 peak\u2014placing the index between 14\u202f000 and 13\u202f740 points\u2014would align with the June lows and the 38.2\u202f% Fibonacci retracement of the overall uptrend that began in October\u202f2022.  He adds that, \u201cMientras no haya un cambio estructural m\u00e1s profundo, lo m\u00e1s probable es que esa ca\u00edda abra una nueva ventana de compra.\u201d  The article also highlights that, in Europe, the EuroStoxx\u202f50 remains in a sideways consolidation with support around 5\u202f150\u20115\u202f200 points and resistance near 5\u202f500\u20115\u202f560 points, suggesting limited buying opportunities without a broader rally adjustment.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 04:24 AM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/13541887/09/25/nadie-consigue-frenar-a-un-ibex-35-que-abre-la-puerta-a-un-ataque-a-los-maximos-del-ano.html)\n\n**Ibex Consolidates Above 15,300 Points**\nOn September\u202f11,\u202f2025, the Spanish stock index Ibex\u202f35 finished the trading day in positive territory, closing above 15,300 points, reflecting market optimism. The index was led by Inditex, which posted a 9\u202f% cumulative gain from August\u202f1 to September\u202f8, surpassing analyst expectations. The largest declines were seen in Puig, still pressured by recent quarterly results and shrinking fragrance margins, and in Grifols, which opened lower amid renewed doubts over the Gotham case and KPMG audits but finished with a 0.5\u202f% rebound. European markets moved higher: the French CAC\u202f40 rose 0.6\u202f%, while Germany\u2019s DAX and the EuroStoxx\u202f50 each gained 0.3\u202f%. BAE\u202fSystems jumped more than 4\u202f% on positive defense\u2011industry outlooks and growing drone interest following tensions in Poland and NATO\u2019s response. In the United States, Wall Street opened higher after employment data showed weekly unemployment claims at their highest level since October\u202f2021, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates. The Nasdaq\u202f100 advanced, led by Micron\u2019s strong AI focus, after Oracle\u2019s prior session. Commodities were negative: gold fell about 0.5\u202f%, oil and natural gas slid roughly 2\u202f%. The euro strengthened slightly against the dollar following Lagarde\u2019s comments and U.S. inflation data. The article quotes Lagarde\u2019s statement that the ECB keeps interest rates unchanged, citing economic resilience and the end of the deflation process: 'El BCE mantiene sin cambios los tipos de inter\u00e9s'.

The ECB\u2019s deposit rate remains at 2%, the main refinancing rate at 2.15%, and the marginal lending facility at 2.40%. In a press conference, ECB President Christine Lagarde announced the end of the disinflationary process and emphasized the institution\u2019s commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% in the medium term. Macro\u2011economic forecasts were slightly revised: the ECB raised its 2024 and 2025 growth estimates by 0.1 percentage point each, while the 2027 estimate was lowered by 0.1 point, leaving inflation at 2.1% for 2024, 1.7% for 2025 and 1.9% for 2027. The ECB also updated its GDP outlook, projecting 1.2% growth in 2025, 1.0% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027.

Since reaching a peak of 15,444 points on 22\u202fAugust, the index has fallen 3.5\u202f% and is now down 4.5\u202f% from that high. Technical analyst Joan Cabrero notes that the Ibex 35 \"no encuentra soporte relevante hasta los 14.000-13.740 puntos\" and that a 10\u202f% drop to 14,000 would trigger a medium\u2011term buying zone, \"Los 14.000, adem\u00e1s, act\u00faan como soporte psicol\u00f3gico de primer orden\".

Joan Cabrero, technical analyst for elEconomista.es, warns that until the gap opened on Tuesday is closed above 15,265 and especially above 15,350, the risk of a correction remains high.  In Europe, the EuroStoxx 50 has had two false breakouts at 5,470 and 5,200 points; a new Judas\u2011type breakout could sow doubt.  The index should close above 5,480 to reduce the risk of a deeper correction; otherwise support only exists at 5,150\u20115,200.  Asian markets are mixed: the Nikkei and other Japanese exchanges are in the red, while Chinese and Korean markets finish above their opening levels.

The Spanish stock market is waiting for a trade agreement between the US and the EU on tariffs, with a possible 15% tariff rate, similar to the agreement with Japan. The European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting is also a key reference point today. Analysts at Renta 4 do not expect changes in interest rates due to the 'intensification' of the deflationary process caused by US policies, which has led to a 13% increase in the value of the euro in 2025 and an 8% drop in oil prices.

Today, a summit between EU and Chinese leaders is taking place, although 'there are no high expectations' due to trade and geopolitical tensions between the two blocs. However, analysts believe that there could be a positive outcome in trade and defense negotiations between the EU and Japan. In Spain, the presentation of corporate results and the Active Population Survey (EPA) are highlighted.

The absence of news in trade negotiations and the confusion over the future of Fed Chairman Powell contributed to investor doubts. The domestic indicator managed to mitigate the declines in the final trading session, maintaining the 14,000 points level. The Ibex 35 lost 0.07% to 14,041.5 units, with energy stocks leading the gains, including Solaria Energ\u00eda (+6.60%), Acciona Energ\u00eda (+2.97%), Naturgy (+1.25%), and Enag\u00e1s (+1.08%). However, declines were led by Puig (-2.33%), IAG (-2.21%), and Indra (-1.43%). BBVA (-0.59%) closed lower after postponing the acceptance period for the Sabadell takeover offer. Other European markets experienced general declines, with the EuroStoxx 50 falling 1% below 5,300 points, and the Dax 40 German index losing over 1% to 24,000 points. According to Joan Cabrero, analyst at Ecotrader, the Ibex 35 'consolidated positions between the resistance zone of 14,360-14,275 points and the support of 13,700 points' last week. Cabrero notes that if the indicator 'does not lose the support of 13,600-13,700 points', the consolidation can be seen as 'a classic digestion of the previous rise' of the Ibex 35, which reached 14,360 points. 'The loss of the support of 13,600-13,700 points would mark the beginning of a correction.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 03:56 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/flash/20250722/62925/)\n\n**Ibex 35 Rises 0.14% at Opening, Spanish Economy Grows 0.6% in Q1**\nThe Ibex 35 index has started the session with a 0.14% increase, reaching 14,054.6 points at 9:00 am. This comes as the Spanish economy grew 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, a tenth less than in the previous quarter, and moderated its annual advance by five tenths, from 3.3% to 2.8%.

This comes after the index closed on Monday at 14,199 points, just below the 14,200 mark. According to the Ministry of Labor, the registered unemployment rate decreased by 57,835 people in May, a 2.3% drop. However, indefinite hiring decreased by 4% and temporary hiring increased by 1.6%.

Despite commercial tensions and economic evolution, the European reference indices have been consuming time in recent sessions, alleviating the overbuying derived from the last strong rises and showing signs of strength. According to Joan Cabrero, technical analyst and strategist at Ecotrader, 'it is likely that we will see another bullish segment at any moment.' In the case of the Ibex 35, this movement could lead the Spanish selectivity to seek the ceiling of the channel that has been guiding the rises in recent years, specifically since 2022. 'Currently, after the last consolidation, the ceiling of this channel is near 14,750 points, but if it takes a bit more time, it could reach 15,000 points,' highlights the expert. This situation, combined with the expectation of a negative start to the day on Wall Street, would increase the accumulated profitability advantage of the Spanish selectivity over the S&P 500 since the beginning of the year. In the last sessions, there has been an increase in the advantage of the Ibex 35 over the Yankee index, with a difference of 24 points in accumulated performance since January. In Europe, the EuroStoxx 50 has been within the line of the vela of May 23 for six sessions, which was the last day when the bears tried to take control and put the rebound of the last weeks at risk, Cabrero says. The expert of Ecotrader indicates that this movement 'is more a sign of strength than weakness.' Cabrero also states that it would surprise him if there were a significant fall in the continental index without the main European reference having at least reached its previous highs of the year, implying an additional potential of 4-5% from the current levels.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 04:44 AM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/13395380/06/25/ibex-35-en-cualquier-momento-podamos-asistir-a-otro-segmento-alcista.html)\n\n**Ibex 35 Maintains 14,300 Points Amid Economic Optimism**\nThe Ibex 35 index opened the session on Wednesday with a 0.1% increase, reaching 14,338.2 points at 9:15 am.

    "summary": "Across diverse expert perspectives\u2014including technical and fundamental analysis, risk management, portfolio strategy, several macroeconomic and finance subfields, and Iberian studies\u2014there is overwhelming consensus that the IBEX 35 will close 2025 above its starting value of 11,595.00. The common reasoning is as follows:\n\n\u2022 The IBEX 35 is currently trading around 15,300, more than 30% (over 3,700 points) above the resolution threshold, providing a substantial buffer against late-year declines.\n\u2022 Spanish corporates, especially banks and Inditex, are reporting robust earnings and demonstrate resilience. Macroeconomic indicators (GDP growth, employment, stable inflation) further support market confidence.\n\u2022 The ECB's steady policy with potential for rate cuts, a favorable monetary environment, and strong investor sentiment add to the index\u2019s support.\n\u2022 Technical analysis and asset pricing models warn of possible market corrections (8\u201310%), but such moves would leave the IBEX well above the required level for a \u2018Yes\u2019 outcome. A drop below 11,595 would need a more than 24% decline in under four months\u2014a scenario considered extremely unlikely outside of a global or systemic crisis (e.g., financial crash, major geopolitical escalation).\n\u2022 Base rates and historical patterns show such drastic late-year reversals are extraordinarily rare in developed markets unless struck by a black-swan event.\n\u2022 Behavioral finance and macroeconomic perspectives also highlight that current positive momentum and resilient investor psychology are likely to persist barring unforeseen shocks.\n\u2022 All experts acknowledge non-zero tail risks\u2014mostly hypothetical scenarios of global financial or geopolitical catastrophe\u2014but agree that no such risk appears imminent or priced in at present.\n\nFinal probabilities assigned by all forecasters converge on extremely high figures (97\u201399%), with the modal response being 98\u201399%. The collective forecast, after group discussion, is that a Yes outcome is overwhelmingly likely barring truly extraordinary, unpredictable events in the final months of 2025.",
