Ongoing legal constraints, the chilling effect of recent judicial rebukes, and the administration\u2019s desire to avoid further litigation or public backlash lead to a pause or halt in significant personnel actions during this period. Any attempted removals (e.g., Lisa Cook, Erik Siebert) are either not on the tracked list or are delayed by court action, so technically, none of the 100 tracked officials leave their posts in the window.",
            "yes_scenario": "At least one official from the list is removed, resigns, or is announced to leave during the window. The most probable scenario is a politically motivated removal under pressure, such as the US Attorney Erik Siebert case (if his position is on the tracked list), or a sudden resignation under duress. Alternatively, President Trump could abruptly fire a cabinet member or agency head in a fit of dissatisfaction, especially those in controversial policy areas or facing public criticism (e.g., DOJ, FBI, or regulatory agencies). Court action is either not immediate or the firing is recognized by the employer within the window, meeting the resolution criteria.",
            "final_reasoning": "The most important factors are the very short time window, the recent wave of firings that has already occurred (making additional high-profile departures less likely), and the strong legal pushback that has resulted in courts blocking or reversing many terminations. The administration\u2019s appetite for further high-profile removals just days after a significant judicial rebuke is likely diminished. At the same time, Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic management style and history of abrupt personnel changes means that risk is not zero, and ongoing threats to specific officials (notably Siebert) are credible. The key uncertainty is whether any of these cases involve officials on the tracked list and whether their departure will be recognized as effective and public within the window. Base rates of turnover for short intervals are very low (<5%) even in high-turnover administrations, and most current movements (Siebert, McEntarfer) either do not match the tracked list or are slowed by litigation. Taking all this into account, I estimate a probability slightly above the base rate for abrupt departures in a high-risk environment, but still low due to the constraining factors.",

Under the resolution criteria, an announcement of removal\u2014by the individual, their employer, or the administration\u2014within the specified window counts as out of position. While legal/institutional friction has delayed some firings (e.g., Lisa Cook at the Fed, OPM\u2019s mass firings), there is no reporting that Siebert\u2019s removal is subject to comparable litigation or delay. Given Trump\u2019s historical pattern of elite purges, the heightened intra-elite conflict, the explicit media signaling, and the lack of credible contrary evidence, the probability of at least one listed official being out of position before October 1, 2025 is very high.

Most recent firings or forced departures (BLS, Fed, mass probationary terminations) happened earlier in the year, and legal pushback (notably the court rulings reversing mass firings) has constrained the administration's ability to execute further dismissals in the short term. While news reports highlight that the administration remains aggressive in seeking to remove officials who are perceived as insufficiently loyal, and there is at least one confirmed case (Siebert) of a removal in progress, he is not among the listed positions. For the officials on the list, there is no direct reporting suggesting imminent departures between now and October 1, 2025. Nonetheless, the Trump administration's record of unpredictability and the existence of personnel under active pressure (e.g., regulatory commissioners, Fed governors, and agency directors) means that a last-minute ouster, resignation, or forced exit cannot be ruled out. Balancing the low base rate and legal/institutional friction against the administration\u2019s aggressive personnel practices, the probability of at least one listed official being out of their position before October 1, 2025, is higher than in a typical administration but remains well below even odds.

The list of 100 roles is broad and includes positions directly targeted by these purges.

The fact that multiple, independent outlets report the administration's intent to remove him before the deadline, and that no credible reporting suggests legal action will stall it, increases the probability above my initial estimate.

The counterpoint from Political Risk Analysis and the critique of maximalist predictions highlighted the importance of formal status over mere announcements, and the risk that even well-sourced imminent removals (such as Siebert) could be delayed, fail to be formally announced, or be held in abeyance through litigation\u2014thus not meeting the resolution criteria in the short window. While the case for a high probability remains strong given the administration\u2019s aggressive personnel practices and credible imminent departures, the procedural stickiness of the US system and recent legal reversals argue for trimming the extremity of the forecast. Weighing these factors, I am lowering my estimate moderately, while still judging the probability to be well above 50%.",

            "reasoning_for_revised_probability": "The group deliberation revealed a sharp divide between those who see the imminent Siebert removal as a near-certain Yes, and those who put more weight on legal friction and the fine print. The critiques of maximalist predictions (85%+) are persuasive: Siebert's ouster is not yet officially announced and could still be delayed or contested, as has happened with Lisa Cook and mass OPM firings. The defense of my original probability highlights the importance of balancing aggressive principal behavior (Trump's willingness to fire) with institutional procedures and legal barriers, especially in a narrow window. However, the cumulative weight of multiple reputable media outlets reporting Siebert's imminent removal\u2014without any suggestion of legal challenge or delay\u2014does tip the balance modestly higher. While extreme probabilities are still unjustified, the risk that at least one listed official is out before October 1 is slightly higher than my initial estimate, primarily due to the convergence of aggressive executive action and credible, specific reporting. I therefore revise upward to 47%.",

            "reasoning_for_revised_probability": "The group deliberation raised valid concerns about the distinction between announced firings and an official, resolution-eligible departure. Several forecasters challenged the high probabilities (including my own) by emphasizing how recent, well-publicized removals (e.g., Lisa Cook, OPM firings) were slowed or blocked by litigation, and that the question's fine print requires unambiguous out-of-position status or a qualifying official announcement within the narrow window. While the imminent removal of Siebert still looks highly probable\u2014and other officials may be at risk\u2014the possibility of last-minute legal or institutional delay is non-trivial. The technical requirements for resolution (formal announcement, no pending litigation/appeal that keeps the official in the role) mean that near-certainty is unwarranted. However, the combination of credible media reports, the administration's aggressive turnover, and the sheer number of positions at risk means the probability remains very high. I am revising downward slightly to account for these procedural uncertainties.",

The judge\u2019s permanent decision, while not ordering reinstatement, required OPM and the affected agencies to remove any derogatory references to the dismissals and to send formal letters to each worker stating the firings were revoked. The ruling followed a preliminary injunction that had been halted by the Supreme Court. AFGE President Everett Kelley said the decision was 'another significant victory for federal employees and for all Americans,' and praised the judge for exposing the \u2018sham record\u2019 used to justify the firings. AFSCME President Lee Saunders echoed the sentiment, noting the relief for members and the broader impact on public services. The firings, carried out between Feb.\u202f12\u201117 via a standardized OPM form letter, targeted 25,000 workers across agencies including Veterans Affairs, Energy, Defense, Agriculture, Interior, Treasury, the FAA, and others. Judge Alsup noted that OPM had directed agencies to terminate employees except those in 'mission\u2011critical' roles or exempted under OPM approval, a directive he deemed unlawful. The case also highlighted exemptions: the Justice Department sought relief for 10,485 workers, and the National Transportation Safety Board argued that cutting even 30 probationary workers would jeopardize investigations such as the Baltimore Harbor bridge collapse and the fatal Army helicopter crash near Washington National Airport, which involved 13 probationary investigators. The unions described the firings as 'one of the most massive employment frauds in U.S. history.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:13 PM\nSource:[People's World](https://peoplesworld.org/?post_type=article&p=152483)\n\n**Trump Deputies Shrink Asylum Loophole by 65 Percent**\nThe article reports that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has reduced President Joe Biden\u2019s asylum loophole by 65\u202fpercent, citing a 1.1\u202fmillion\u2011case backlog that is being processed more quickly.

The investigation, begun in April\u202f2022 under Director Christopher\u202fWray, involved more than 150 interviews, over 400 subpoenas (300 for witness records, 200 phone selectors, 20 financial probes), and search warrants for 10 phones, 20 devices, seven iCloud accounts, 28 emails and even Trump\u2019s Twitter. Second, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome\u202fPowell announced a 0.25\u2011percentage\u2011point cut to the benchmark interest rate, the first reduction since December\u202f2024, citing a slight rise in unemployment and persistent inflation. Powell said, 'While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals and in light of this shift in the balance of risks, today the Federal market committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point.' The move lifted the Dow and S&P\u202f500 to record highs and is expected to be followed by similar cuts in October and December.

Siebert, who was nominated by President Trump in May and had served as interim US attorney since January, was asked to bring charges after the Justice Department\u2019s probe into James was triggered by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte\u2019s claims that she misrepresented her residence status on mortgage applications. The article notes that Siebert\u2019s office found insufficient evidence to charge James, and that he may continue working as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia after his removal. The piece also recounts that James won a $454\u202fmillion civil\u2011fraud case against Trump in 2024, a penalty that was struck down by a New\u202fYork appeals court in August but that upheld the finding that Trump inflated the value of his assets. Trump\u2019s administration, led by Justice Department official Ed Martin, targeted several Democrats\u2014including James, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and Senator Adam Schiff\u2014over mortgage\u2011fraud allegations; Cook was fired in August, sued Trump, and a federal judge allowed her to remain in office pending a Supreme Court ruling. Schiff, a long\u2011time critic of Trump, was pardoned by President Biden. The article presents these facts without overt editorializing, citing the actions of Trump officials and the DOJ\u2019s investigations as the primary sources of information.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 10:08 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/politics/trump-officials-set-to-remove-us-attorney-over-james-probe-11758319455156.html)\n\n**Report: Trump to oust US attorney who wouldn't charge Letitia James**\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to fire U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert because Siebert failed to find evidence that New York Attorney General Letitia James committed mortgage fraud. ABC News reported that Trump officials pressured Siebert to bring charges against James, but he did not. Trump has a history of animosity toward James, dating back to her successful lawsuit against the Trump Organization, which resulted in a $354\u202fmillion fine that was later overturned by a New York appeals court. The mortgage fraud investigation into James began in April after Bill Pulte, director of the Federal House Finance Agency, sent a criminal referral to the DOJ. Trump officials have accused James of falsely claiming her Virginia property was her primary residence on a 2023 financial document, a claim that would violate her legal requirement to live in New York as an elected official. Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'Letitia James, a totally corrupt politician, should resign from her position as New York State Attorney General, IMMEDIATELY,' and added, 'Everyone is trying to MAKE NEW YORK GREAT AGAIN, and it can never be done with this wacky crook in office.' Siebert was nominated by Trump in May, but the administration now plans to replace him with a U.S. attorney who will more aggressively investigate James. Democratic and liberal critics say the DOJ is being used to target Trump\u2019s political foes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-15114879/Report-Trump-set-oust-US-attorney-wouldnt-charge-Letitia-James.html)\n\n**Trump Plots to Fire Prosecutor for Failing to Charge His Nemesis**\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly planning to fire U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert of the Eastern District of Virginia after Siebert declined to bring criminal charges against New\u202fYork Attorney General Letitia James, whom Trump has accused of mortgage fraud.  According to ABC\u202fNews, the Trump administration asked the Department of Justice in April to investigate James for alleged mortgage fraud, but investigators found that James only listed the home as a primary residence on a limited power\u2011of\u2011attorney form that allowed her niece to sign documents on her behalf; loan officers who approved the mortgage did not consider the document, sources told ABC.  Despite this, the administration demanded charges, and after Siebert refused, officials warned him that Trump plans to fire him, potentially destabilizing the office.  Siebert, who has served as interim U.S. attorney since January and was nominated by Trump in May, is expected to leave by Friday.  The administration intends to replace him with someone who will pursue James more aggressively.  Trump has publicly called James a \"totally corrupt politician\" and urged her resignation on Truth Social, saying \"Letitia James, a totally corrupt politician, should resign from her position as New\u202fYork State Attorney General, IMMEDIATELY,\" and that \"Everyone is trying to MAKE NEW\u202fYORK GREAT AGAIN, and it can never be done with this wacky crook in office.\"  The DOJ is also investigating James for \"deprivation of rights,\" and Trump had stripped her of her security clearance in February.  The article notes that similar mortgage\u2011fraud claims have been directed at Sen. Adam Schiff and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, despite evidence to the contrary.  It also references the court case where the Trump Organization was found to have committed fraud by over\u2011inflating property values, resulting in a judgment for $364\u202fmillion plus interest, now about $527\u202fmillion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-plots-to-fire-prosecutor-for-failing-to-charge-his-nemesis-letitia-james/)\n\n**Government Workers, AFSCME cheer judge's ruling against Trump's firings**\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco ruled that the Trump administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) illegally terminated 25,000 probationary federal workers in February 2025.

Patel, a former aide to Donald Trump, was confirmed on 20\u202fFebruary\u202f2025 with 51 votes in favor and 49 against, a much narrower margin than the 90\u2011plus votes that secured his predecessors.  He has repeatedly defended his actions in high\u2011profile cases, including the investigation of Charlie\u202fKirk\u2019s alleged murder, where he announced a suspect on social media and released photos and videos despite agency recommendations.  Critics point to the mass exodus of FBI personnel\u2014about 5,000 employees fired or retired since Patel took command\u2014as evidence of a \u201cdeep state\u201d purge.  The former director of the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, Brian\u202fDriscoll, has sued the agency, claiming Patel knew the firings were possibly illegal.  Patel has also defended the handling of the Jeffrey\u202fEpstein files, asserting there is no credible evidence of a \u201cclient list\u201d and that the DOJ\u2019s July memo was accurate.  Trump has publicly praised Patel, calling him a \u201cbrilliant lawyer\u201d and a defender of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d  The article quotes Patel saying, \u2018No pienso irme a ning\u00fan lado,\u2019 and Maria\u202fPuerta Riera, a professor at Valencia College, stating, \u2018La principal credencial de Patel no es la idoneidad para el cargo, sino su lealtad al presidente.\u2019  The piece also notes that 5,000 staff have been dismissed, and that the agency\u2019s chief, Andrew\u202fBailey, was appointed as a deputy director on 15\u202fSeptember\u202f2025.

CNBC notes the revision was on the high end of Wall Street expectations, ranging from 600,000 to 1\u202fmillion, and that the adjustment was more than 50\u202f% higher than last year\u2019s and the largest on record since 2002. The article argues that the Biden administration\u2019s positive job\u2011growth narratives were misleading, implying the Fed should have cut rates earlier. It cites a Wall Street Journal quote that the revision could amplify worries about a weaker job market and notes that the Fed\u2019s next rate\u2011cut decision will be influenced by the new data. The piece frames the revisions as evidence of systemic problems with the BLS, calls for an overhaul, and suggests that Trump\u2019s decision to fire the BLS head was justified. The tone is strongly critical of Biden and supportive of Trump, presenting the revisions as a vindication of Trump\u2011era policy.\n\nEvidence: The article states the revision was \u2013911,000 jobs, the largest since 2008, and that CNBC reported the revision was \u201con the high end of Wall Street expectations, which ranged from a low around 600,000 to as many as a million.\u201d It also quotes CNBC that the revisions were \u201cmore than 50\u202f% higher than last year\u2019s adjustment and the largest on record going back to 2002.\u201d The Wall Street Journal quote is cited as \u201cBut the report, even though it is for a period that ended nearly a half year ago, could amplify worries that the job market\u2026started from a lower baseline than previously known.\u201d\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[conservativeinstitute.org](https://conservativeinstitute.org/articles/daniel-vaughan-bidens-strong-economy-evaporates-in-one-report.htm)\n\n**War against workers in U.S. intensifies**\nThe article claims that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration fired BLS director Erika McEntarfer on Aug.\u202f1, 2025, and immediately nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni as her replacement. It cites the BLS monthly \u2018jobs report\u2019 released that day, which states that only '73,000 jobs were created' in the U.S. from May through July 2025, arguing that the figure underestimates unemployment and is part of a broader campaign to replace workers with AI and dismantle unions. The piece references a New\u202fYork\u202fTimes article titled 'Year Will End With 300,000 Fewer Federal Workers, Trump Official Says', which reports that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has initiated a mass layoff program that would cut the federal civilian workforce by about one in eight, the largest single\u2011year reduction since WWII. It notes that over 1\u202fmillion federal workers are unionized\u2014more than 50\u202f% of the federal workforce\u2014compared with less than 6\u202f% unionization in the private sector. The article also reports that the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) had its 1962 labor agreement unilaterally voided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and that the EPA union contract was similarly nullified. The author concludes that the labor movement faces an existential threat from \u2018fascist\u2011minded administrators\u2019 and calls for a general strike, citing statements from AFGE president Justin Chen: 'This is the greatest attack on labor rights since the PATCO strike' and 'We're just the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the working class, essentially.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 09:36 PM\nSource:[Workers World](https://www.workers.org/2025/08/87519/)\n\n**Trump-Backed Group Launches Campaign to Remove Federal Employees**\nA group supporting former US President Donald Trump has launched a campaign to remove federal employees, including 175 civil servants, from their positions, accusing them of promoting liberal ideas. According to Reuters, many of these employees are women and people of color who have served for decades in Republican and Democratic administrations, often in positions unknown to the public. More than 20 employees who were listed on the 'watchlists' spoke to Reuters, revealing the impact on their lives. Some have increased security measures in their homes or avoided public appearances, while others have removed their personal information from the internet. Over half of them reported feeling anxious, with some describing their lives as 'quietly collapsing', and others experiencing depression and isolation. Reuters relied on legal documents, public records, and interviews with over 30 sources to track the transformation of 'American Accountability Foundation' from a research organization opposing President Joe Biden to a powerful tool in Trump's campaign to purge perceived 'internal enemies'. The organization targets professional employees who implement current government policies, not political appointees, and justifies this by claiming that many of them have liberal leanings and may be working in secret to undermine Trump's agenda, according to the organization's president, Tom Jones, who told Fox News in June 2024: 'These people want to remain invisible within the agencies, and we will expose them.' In response to Reuters, Jones defended his organization's work, stating that their goal is to alert employees who oppose Trump that they are being monitored. He said: 'We stand by our research, and our only regret is that more of these individuals did not leave their positions to be replaced by those who are committed to the American people's agenda.' Reuters reported that at least 88 employees have left their government jobs or been forced to take administrative leave. Some were fired during Trump's mass federal layoffs, while others left in fear of being fired or reassigned, and two have fled the country fearing for their safety.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 07:15 PM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/3519667)\n\n**Trump Fires Director of Bureau of Labor Statistics, Accusing Her of Manipulating Employment Data**\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered the immediate dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating employment data. Trump claimed that McEntarfer, appointed by former President Joe Biden, falsified employment numbers before the 2024 election to benefit Kamala Harris's chances of winning. Trump stated, 'I have instructed my team to fire this politically appointed person by Biden, IMMEDIATELY.' He added, 'Important statistics like this must be just and precise; they cannot be manipulated for political purposes.' An analysis by CNN suggests that Trump defended McEntarfer's sudden dismissal, arguing that recent employment reports undermined his message of a 'new golden era.' The move has been seen as an attempt to align official data with a favorable economic narrative for his administration. However, this analysis emphasizes that this action, along with attempts to pressure the Federal Reserve, threatens to erode confidence in the country's economic institutions. William Beach, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, stated, 'The BLS is the best statistical agency in the world. Its numbers enjoy trust worldwide.' He added, 'However, I believe the president's attack on the commissioner and the office is undermining that infrastructure and could undermine that trust in the long term.' The latest employment report revealed a more somber picture than expected, with the US economy creating 73,000 jobs in July, according to the Department of Labor. The number of jobs forecast for May and June was also revised downward, with adjusted figures (19,000 in May and 14,000 in June) being the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trump claimed that McEntarfer, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, had falsified employment numbers before the 2024 elections to boost the chances of Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump stated, 'I've just been informed that the employment numbers for our country are being prepared by a person designated by Biden, who falsified the numbers before the elections to try to increase the chances of victory for Kamala Harris.' He ordered his team to 'immediately fire this politically designated person by Biden,' arguing that Americans need accurate employment numbers. Trump claimed that employment numbers have been manipulated to make Republicans look bad. 'McEntarfer says only 73,000 jobs have been created (what a surprise!). Similar things happened in the first part of the year, always with negative numbers,' Trump said. The July employment report showed that 73,000 jobs were created, while the market had projected 106,000 new jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler announced her resignation several months before the end of her term, without specifying the reason for her departure, but in the context of tensions between Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Kugler stated, 'It has been an honor for me to be part of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. I feel especially honored to have served during a crucial moment to achieve our dual mandate: reducing prices and maintaining a solid and resilient labor market.' Powell thanked Kugler for her service and wished her much success in her future responsibilities, highlighting her impressive experience and academic knowledge in her work on the Board of Governors.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 09:15 PM\nSource:[LA TERCERA](https://www.latercera.com/pulso/noticia/trump-despide-a-la-responsable-de-estadisticas-laborales-tras-malosl-datos-de-empleo-de-julio/)\n\n**Trump Fires Official Accused of Manipulating Employment Figures**\nUS President Donald Trump ordered the immediate dismissal of a government official, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, who he accused of manipulating employment figures.

The US government claims that the economy is booming and wants the Federal Reserve to support it further by lowering interest rates.

Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth, 'She will be replaced by someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like these must be just and accurate, not manipulated for political purposes.' Trump claimed that McEntarfer 'falsified' employment data before the November presidential election to help the chances of his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, there is no evidence to support Trump's claims. McEntarfer was confirmed as commissioner by the Senate in January 2024, with 86 votes in favor and 8 against. The White House released a statement saying, 'The long history of inaccuracies and incompetence by Erika McEntarfer, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics designated by Biden, has completely eroded the public's trust in the government agency responsible for disseminating key data used by policymakers and businesses to make important decisions.' The statement also claimed that the agency was plagued by technical errors and leaks of confidential information during McEntarfer's tenure. The order to fire McEntarfer comes amid a wave of mass firings of federal officials, sparked by Supreme Court decisions to overturn lower court rulings that had deemed the firings illegal. The departure of career officials has raised concerns about the quality of economic data, which has long been considered a benchmark. In early 2024, Trump's Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, dissolved two expert committees that worked with the government on economic outcome statistics. Lutnick also suggested eliminating the GDP report from the government, considering that 'all governments' have gotten entangled in the data. The July employment data shows that the labor market has begun to feel the impact of the volatile commercial policy of the Republican administration and, above all, the mass layoffs in the federal administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, a month in which 73,000 new jobs were created, far below the 110,000 expected by analysts and also below the numbers recorded since January. The slowdown in the market would give Powell arguments to decide not to lower interest rates, but it could also serve as ammunition for Trump to increase pressure on Powell.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 08:57 PM\nSource:[elpais.com](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-08-01/trump-despide-a-su-responsable-de-estadisticas-laborales-despues-de-que-publicara-una-desaceleracion-del-empleo.html)\n\n**Trump Fires Biden-Appointed Labor Official Over Employment Data**\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered the dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the federal official responsible for labor statistics, after the release of employment data showing a slowdown in job growth. McEntarfer was appointed by former President Joe Biden. Trump accused the economist of manipulating employment figures before the 2024 elections to favor a victory for Kamala Harris, but presented no evidence to support this claim. He stated that under his leadership, the US economy is 'thriving'. McEntarfer, an economist and Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) since January 29, 2024, was nominated by Biden in July 2023 and confirmed by the Senate in January 2024. Trump claimed that McEntarfer 'manipulated' employment figures to favor Harris' electoral chances, stating that 'we need accurate employment numbers. I've ordered my team to fire this Biden-appointed official immediately. She will be replaced by someone much more competent and qualified.' Trump also stated that 'important numbers like this must be fair and accurate; they cannot be manipulated for political purposes.' McEntarfer has not commented on the news. The controversy comes after a report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday, which stated that in July, only 73,000 new jobs were created, a figure far below projections. Additionally, revisions to data from the previous two months show that the situation is much worse than thought. Although the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, the report notes that more people left the workforce. On average, over the past three months, only 35,000 jobs were created per month, the slowest growth since the pandemic began in 2020.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 07:07 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/usa/2025/08/01/trump-despedira-a-economista-designada-por-biden-tras-anunciarse-una-baja-tasa-de-empleo-en-eeuu-falsifico-las-cifras-lrtmus-57266)\n\n**Trump Fires BLS Commissioner Over Employment Data**\nUS President Donald Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), after the agency released a report showing a decline in employment numbers. Trump accused McEntarfer of manipulating data to benefit his opponent, Kamala Harris. The report showed that the US economy created 73,000 new jobs in July, below expectations, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. The numbers for May and June were revised downward, with a reduction of 258,000 jobs from the initial report. Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'I just found out that the 'Employment Numbers' are being manipulated by a Biden appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of the BLS, who altered the numbers to benefit Kamala [Harris] before the election. This is the same office that increased the number of jobs in March 2024 by about 818,000 and again, just before the presidential election of 2024, in August and September, with 112,000.' Trump added, 'We need accurate employment numbers. I have already determined that she will be fired IMMEDIATELY and replaced by someone much more capable.' The president also criticized the revision of the employment numbers, saying, 'McEntarfer said that 73,000 jobs were added (a surprise!), but the most serious thing is the correction of 258,000 lost jobs in the two previous months. This has been happening constantly, always with negative numbers. The economy is thriving under the 'TRUMP' government, despite a Federal Reserve that is also making moves, this time with interest rates.' The unemployment rate in the US rose to 4.2% in July, according to data released by the government on Friday, 1st. These numbers indicate signs of deceleration in the labor market, with companies preparing for the impact of Trump's tariffs.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 04:11 PM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/mundo/trump-demite-funcionaria-apos-departamento-divulgar-dados-ruins-de-emprego-nos-eua/)\n\n**Tracking Trump's overhaul of the federal workforce**\nThe Trump administration's plan to cut spending and downsize the federal government has resulted in thousands of federal workers being laid off or issued immediate termination notifications.

    "summary": "The forecasts from experts on whether any of the listed US federal government officials will be out of their position before October 1, 2025, reflect a range of probabilities but generally lean toward a 'Yes' resolution. Most experts recognize the Trump administration's aggressive approach to personnel management and the high rate of attempted and executed firings, especially for perceived disloyalty. Specific media reports suggesting the imminent removal of officials like US Attorney Erik Siebert are widely cited as evidence that at least one departure is likely within the window. However, several forecasters note significant countervailing factors: the short time frame for the resolution window, legal/judicial constraints that have delayed or blocked removals (e.g., Lisa Cook\u2019s litigation), and the potential for bureaucratic inertia to push removals past the window. Probability estimates cluster at the high end (85%, 87%, 95%, 99%) among those giving greatest weight to recent turnover, direct news evidence, and historical precedent from Trump\u2019s first term. More moderate or lower probabilities (8%, 22%, 37%) come from forecasters placing more emphasis on legal pushback, the low base rate of departures in very short windows, and uncertainty about whether ongoing firings (such as Siebert\u2019s) directly affect individuals on the specific official list. All agree the risk is significantly above a normal administration, and all see a nonzero chance of no qualifying departure if legal or procedural barriers delay announcements or actions. In summary: While legal and technical hurdles could block some firings, the combination of explicit media reporting, Trump\u2019s documented willingness to act swiftly, and the historically high base rate of turnover combine to make the probability of a 'Yes' outcome high to very high, unless unexpected legal blocking occurs for every targeted official.",
