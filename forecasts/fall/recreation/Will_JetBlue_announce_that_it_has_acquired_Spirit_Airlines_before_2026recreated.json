The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn July 28, 2022, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1158463/000119312522204208/d319514dex991.htm) that their boards of directors had approved a merger between the two companies through which JetBlue would acquire Spirit for $33.50 a share, at an enterprise value of $7.6 billion, and following the merger would eventually operate as a single airline under the JetBlue name and be the 5th largest airline in the United States. The airlines [planned](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/business/jetblue-spirit-merger.html) to complete the transaction in the first half of 2024.  On October 19, 2022 Spirit's shareholders [approved](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1498710/000149871022000336/a221019stockholderapprov.htm) the deal. \n\nOn March 7, 2023, the US Department of Justice [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-jetblue-s-proposed-acquisition-spirit) an antitrust lawsuit to block the acquisition on the grounds that it would harm consumers by eliminating an ultra-low-cost carrier, which would result in, according to the DOJ, \"raising costs for the flying public and harming cost-conscious fliers most acutely.\" JetBlue and Spirit [announced](https://investor.jetblue.com/news/news-details/2023/JetBlue-and-Spirit-Will-Continue-to-Advance-Plan-to-Create-Compelling-National-Low-Fare-Challenger-to-the-Dominant-U.S.-Carriers/default.aspx) that they would \"vigorously defend\"  against the DOJ's suit, arguing that the post-merger JetBlue would be a stronger and more competitive airline against the legacy carriers.\n\nAccording to [research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/done-deal-why-many-large-transactions-fail-to-cross-the-finish-line) by McKinsey, in any given year about 10% of large M&A transactions are cancelled, with larger combinations being more likely to be cancelled. The 2nd most common reason for mergers to be terminated is for regulatory or antitrust concerns. A recent [legal analysis](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2022/11/07/doj-sees-mixed-results-in-litigation-focused-antitrust-strategy/?slreturn=20230209091925) finds the DOJ under the Biden Administration to have a more expansive view of antitrust and a willingness to go to trial even when facing difficult cases.

According to a memo from CEO Dave Davis cited by CNBC, the carrier will trim its November flight schedule, expecting a roughly 25% drop in capacity this year as it \"optimises\" its network for stronger markets. Davis said, '\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bb6\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u3002' He added that negotiations with union leaders will take place in the coming weeks. The airline has already suspended and demoted hundreds of pilots, and some cabin crew are on unpaid leave. In the March\u2011June period, Spirit posted a $257\u202fmillion loss, and after a failed merger with JetBlue, it faces higher costs, weak U.S. travel demand and intense competition. The story was reported by CNBC and published by the Malaysian Oriental Daily (\u4e1c\u65b9\u7f51).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 04:57 AM\nSource:[\u6771\u65b9\u7db2 \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u6771\u65b9\u65e5\u5831](https://www.orientaldaily.com.my/news/business/2025/09/18/762371)\n\n**Spirit Airlines to Cut Jobs and Reduce Flights Amid Second Restructuring in 2025 - EconoTimes**\nSpirit Airlines announced a second restructuring for 2025 that will cut about 25% of its flight capacity and lead to significant job losses. Chief Executive Dave Davis explained that the changes aim to 'optimize' the carrier\u2019s network by concentrating on stronger markets, but acknowledged that the evaluations will inevitably affect staffing levels, with union leaders to be consulted in the coming weeks. The move follows earlier capacity reductions from March to June and follows the airline\u2019s exit from its first bankruptcy. Spirit has already implemented furloughs, demotions for hundreds of pilots, and unpaid leave for many flight attendants. Financially, the airline reported a $257\u202fmillion loss for the March\u2011June period, amid higher operating costs, softer U.S. travel demand, and increased competition, especially after a failed merger with JetBlue Airways. Analysts view the aggressive restructuring as a response to the volatile budget\u2011airline environment, hoping that reduced routes and tighter operations will help restore profitability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 03:37 AM\nSource:[EconoTimes](https://econotimes.com/Spirit-Airlines-to-Cut-Jobs-and-Reduce-Flights-Amid-Second-Restructuring-in-2025-1720945)\n\n**United CEO declares death of low-cost flights**\nUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby sparked controversy on September 10, 2025, when he predicted the collapse of Spirit Airlines and declared the era of ultra\u2011low\u2011cost flying was ending. Kirby said, 'Because I'm good at math,' to explain why he believes Spirit will fail, during a Q&A at the Airline Passenger Experience Association conference in Long Beach, California. He has long criticized discount carriers for relying on growth that he says is unsustainable, and he warned that a model that 'predicated on'screw the customer' is doomed. Kirby also attacked Spirit\u2019s business model at a separate event in Washington, DC, prompting backlash from Spirit\u2019s social media, where a post read, 'Scott is finally right about something -- it is all about customers.'\n\nSpirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2024 for the second time in a year, after failing to make significant changes during its first attempt. The airline, based in Florida and known for its bright yellow planes, emerged from bankruptcy in March 2024 after creditors approved a restructuring plan that wiped out all existing shares. Spirit now carries $2.4\u202fbillion in long\u2011term debt, most due in 2030, and reported a negative free cash flow of $1\u202fbillion at the end of the second quarter. In the same period, Spirit furloughed 270 pilots and demoted another 140 to cut costs.\n\nSpirit had previously sought a merger with Frontier Airlines in 2022, but JetBlue Airways outbid Frontier and the deal was later blocked by the Department of Justice for violating antitrust laws. The airline has struggled with losses and declining revenue since the pandemic and has not posted an annual profit since before the pandemic. Kirby\u2019s comments reflect United\u2019s broader criticism of the ultra\u2011low\u2011cost model, which includes carriers such as Frontier, Sun Country, Southwest, JetBlue and Allegiant, but United claims these competitors are more customer\u2011friendly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 01:01 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-15107325/United-CEO-declares-death-low-cost-flights.html)\n\n**United Airlines CEO gives major update on bid to purchase struggling rival**\nUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby confirmed on Tuesday that United will not acquire assets from Spirit Airlines, dismissing speculation that United might rescue the bankrupt carrier.  'It's not in our wheelhouse,' Kirby told Reuters, explaining that each Spirit plane would need roughly $15\u202fmillion in modifications to meet United's standards and that Spirit's slots\u2014such as those at Fort Lauderdale\u2014lack sufficient gates for United's operations.  United has begun operating new flights in markets where Spirit previously flew, giving customers alternatives if Spirit ceases service.  In late August\u202f2025, Frontier Airlines announced a similar strategy, adding 20 new routes in former Spirit markets; Deutsche Bank analysts said Frontier profited from Spirit's bankruptcy.  Both United and Frontier face challenges from customer preference for premium options, an oversupply of domestic flights, and rising labor costs.  Spirit filed for Chapter\u202f11 bankruptcy in August, its second filing within a year; after the filing, Spirit cut routes and staff, creating opportunities for rivals.  Kirby noted that 'If I dig deeper into it and I look at every airline that's not named United Airlines or Delta Airlines, I can find at every single one of them, a double\u2011digit percentage of their route network that loses money,' and argued that struggling airlines must 'stop flying to places that lose money.'  JetBlue had negotiated a merger with Spirit but abandoned the plan in March\u202f2024.  Spirit will officially drop all routes to 11 airports from October\u202f2.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 09:17 PM\nSource:[The US Sun](https://www.the-sun.com/travel/15199264/scott-kirby-united-airlines-spirit-bankruptcy-buy/)\n\n**Spirit Airlines Announces Flight Cuts and Layoffs Amid Second Bankruptcy**\nSpirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis announced on 17\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 that the carrier will cut 25\u202f% of its flights in November and reduce its route network by 11 destinations, canceling a 12th planned route. The airline is also negotiating with suppliers and aircraft lessors to reassess its fleet size, a move that will affect staffing levels. Davis said the company will keep employees informed throughout the process and will meet union leaders in the coming weeks. Spirit, which filed for bankruptcy twice in 2024, has already placed hundreds of pilots on unpaid leave and offered voluntary unpaid leave to cabin crew. Earlier in September, the airline cut 11 routes and cancelled a 12th; United, Frontier and JetBlue have launched new services to attract Spirit passengers. The American Federation of Airworkers said the latest bankruptcy poses greater challenges than the first. Spirit has historically relied on high\u2011density seating and low operating costs. Since emerging from bankruptcy in March, the airline has not made major reforms, converting about $800\u202fmillion of creditor debt into equity, and remains under financial pressure, reporting a loss of $257\u202fmillion from March\u202f13 to end\u2011June\u202f2025.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy again in August after a cash\u2011flow crunch, and has already put hundreds of pilots on unpaid leave and demoted cabin crew. Earlier this month the airline cut 11 destinations and cancelled a 12th. United, Frontier and JetBlue have launched new routes to capture Spirit\u2019s customers. The American Federation of Air\u2011Line Employees said the latest bankruptcy poses a greater challenge than the first, and the union is working with bankruptcy lawyers to protect cabin crew rights. Spirit\u2019s business model relies on high seat density, minimal ancillary services and low operating costs. Since emerging from bankruptcy protection in March, the company has not made major reforms and still carries about $800\u202fmillion of debt that was converted to equity, leaving financial pressure high. From 13 March to 30 June the airline lost roughly $257\u202fmillion.

According to a memo from CEO Dave Davis cited by CNBC, the carrier will trim its November flight schedule, expecting a roughly 25% drop in capacity this year as it \"optimises\" its network for stronger markets. Davis said, '\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bb6\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u3002' He added that negotiations with union leaders will take place in the coming weeks. The airline has already suspended and demoted hundreds of pilots, and some cabin crew are on unpaid leave. In the March\u2011June period, Spirit posted a $257\u202fmillion loss, and after a failed merger with JetBlue, it faces higher costs, weak U.S. travel demand and intense competition.

Chief Executive Dave Davis explained that the changes aim to 'optimize' the carrier\u2019s network by concentrating on stronger markets, but acknowledged that the evaluations will inevitably affect staffing levels, with union leaders to be consulted in the coming weeks. The move follows earlier capacity reductions from March to June and follows the airline\u2019s exit from its first bankruptcy. Spirit has already implemented furloughs, demotions for hundreds of pilots, and unpaid leave for many flight attendants. Financially, the airline reported a $257\u202fmillion loss for the March\u2011June period, amid higher operating costs, softer U.S. travel demand, and increased competition, especially after a failed merger with JetBlue Airways. Analysts view the aggressive restructuring as a response to the volatile budget\u2011airline environment, hoping that reduced routes and tighter operations will help restore profitability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 03:37 AM\nSource:[EconoTimes](https://econotimes.com/Spirit-Airlines-to-Cut-Jobs-and-Reduce-Flights-Amid-Second-Restructuring-in-2025-1720945)\n\n**Holiday travel nightmare looms as US airline cuts a quarter of flights**\nSpirit Airlines is slashing 25\u202f% of its flights for the November schedule, a move announced by CEO Dave Davis in a memo to employees. The cuts are part of a broader cost\u2011cutting effort following a second bankruptcy filing in August and a prior 25\u202f% reduction when the carrier emerged from bankruptcy in March. The airline has already furloughed 270 pilots and demoted 140 others in July. Spirit has lost nearly $257\u202fmillion since March and is now seeking to shrink itself to survive. The company is also planning to file for bankruptcy again after a failed merger with JetBlue, and union officials warned that the upcoming bankruptcy will be \"much more difficult\" than the last one. The airline\u2019s network will see the removal of routes to 12 cities\u2014including Albuquerque, Birmingham, Boise, Chattanooga, Columbia, Portland, Salt Lake City, Oakland, San Diego, Sacramento and San Jose\u2014though the specific November cuts have not yet been announced. The timing of the cuts could disrupt holiday travel, as the airline\u2019s November schedule will be cut by 25\u202f% and the company is in talks with union leaders about further job cuts. The article cites Spirit\u2019s financial losses, the failed merger talks, and the competitive pressure from United, Frontier and JetBlue as key factors driving the airline\u2019s restructuring.\n\nKey metrics: 25\u202f% flight reduction, 270 pilots furloughed, 140 pilots demoted, $257\u202fmillion loss since March, 12 cities cut, 25\u202f% capacity reduction in March, second bankruptcy filing in August.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 02:28 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/consumer/article-15109633/spirit-airlines-cuts-quarter-flights-bankruptcy.html)\n\n**There's Bad News if You Like Traveling to Mexico**\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has announced that the joint venture between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico will end in January\u202f2026, revoking the antitrust immunity granted in 2016.  DOT cited concerns that the partnership violated the U.S.\u2013Mexico 'open skies' agreement by limiting access to Mexico City\u2019s airport.  The decision follows a tentative non\u2011renewal in January\u202f2024 and formally sets an official end date for the collaboration.  The joint venture had allowed the two SkyTeam carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing and revenue sharing as if they were a single airline, offering reciprocal frequent\u2011flyer benefits and seamless transfers for passengers traveling between the United States and Mexico.  With the partnership dissolved, passengers may face longer connection times and fewer flight options, and fares could vary depending on which carrier sells the ticket.  Delta\u2019s spokesperson said, 'We are disappointed that the Department of Transportation has chosen to terminate its approval of the strategic and pro\u2011competitive partnership between Delta and Aeromexico, a decision that will cause significant harm to U.S. jobs, communities and consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico.'  The move leaves the U.S.\u2013Mexico air market without a comparable agreement, as other U.S. carriers such as American and United do not have similar cooperation with Mexican airlines.  Mexican President Claudia\u202fSheinbaum defended the country\u2019s airport restrictions as measures to reduce congestion rather than to disadvantage U.S. carriers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 05:32 PM\nSource:[Fodors Travel Guide](https://www.fodors.com/?p=266402)\n\n**United CEO declares death of low-cost flights**\nUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby sparked controversy on September 10, 2025, when he predicted the collapse of Spirit Airlines and declared the era of ultra\u2011low\u2011cost flying was ending. Kirby said, 'Because I'm good at math,' to explain why he believes Spirit will fail, during a Q&A at the Airline Passenger Experience Association conference in Long Beach, California. He has long criticized discount carriers for relying on growth that he says is unsustainable, and he warned that a model that 'predicated on'screw the customer' is doomed. Kirby also attacked Spirit\u2019s business model at a separate event in Washington, DC, prompting backlash from Spirit\u2019s social media, where a post read, 'Scott is finally right about something -- it is all about customers.'\n\nSpirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2024 for the second time in a year, after failing to make significant changes during its first attempt. The airline, based in Florida and known for its bright yellow planes, emerged from bankruptcy in March 2024 after creditors approved a restructuring plan that wiped out all existing shares. Spirit now carries $2.4\u202fbillion in long\u2011term debt, most due in 2030, and reported a negative free cash flow of $1\u202fbillion at the end of the second quarter. In the same period, Spirit furloughed 270 pilots and demoted another 140 to cut costs.\n\nSpirit had previously sought a merger with Frontier Airlines in 2022, but JetBlue Airways outbid Frontier and the deal was later blocked by the Department of Justice for violating antitrust laws. The airline has struggled with losses and declining revenue since the pandemic and has not posted an annual profit since before the pandemic. Kirby\u2019s comments reflect United\u2019s broader criticism of the ultra\u2011low\u2011cost model, which includes carriers such as Frontier, Sun Country, Southwest, JetBlue and Allegiant, but United claims these competitors are more customer\u2011friendly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 01:01 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-15107325/United-CEO-declares-death-low-cost-flights.html)\n\n**Spirit Airlines Offers Flights for Only US$54.99 to New York, Los Angeles and Miami: How to Take Advantage of the Promotion**\nSpirit Airlines announced a promotion offering one\u2011way flights for only US$54.99 to Miami, New York and Los Angeles as part of its Hispanic Heritage Month celebration, despite the airline filing for bankruptcy for the second time in less than a year. The offer is valid from this Monday until September 22, 2025, for travel between October 15 and November 19, 2025, and requires a 21\u2011day advance purchase. Spirit\u2019s debt is reported to be between US$1\u202fbillion and US$10\u202fbillion.

She added, 'Los viajeros que buscan explorar las tradiciones y la exquisita gastronom\u00eda de los centros culturales hispanos pueden disfrutar de nuestras opciones de viaje de gran valor hacia destinos maravillosos.' The airline also noted that in Puerto Rico it is the third largest carrier at Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport.

'It's not in our wheelhouse,' Kirby told Reuters, explaining that each Spirit plane would need roughly $15\u202fmillion in modifications to meet United's standards and that Spirit's slots\u2014such as those at Fort Lauderdale\u2014lack sufficient gates for United's operations.  United has begun operating new flights in markets where Spirit previously flew, giving customers alternatives if Spirit ceases service.  In late August\u202f2025, Frontier Airlines announced a similar strategy, adding 20 new routes in former Spirit markets; Deutsche Bank analysts said Frontier profited from Spirit's bankruptcy.  Both United and Frontier face challenges from customer preference for premium options, an oversupply of domestic flights, and rising labor costs.  Spirit filed for Chapter\u202f11 bankruptcy in August, its second filing within a year; after the filing, Spirit cut routes and staff, creating opportunities for rivals.  Kirby noted that 'If I dig deeper into it and I look at every airline that's not named United Airlines or Delta Airlines, I can find at every single one of them, a double\u2011digit percentage of their route network that loses money,' and argued that struggling airlines must 'stop flying to places that lose money.'  JetBlue had negotiated a merger with Spirit but abandoned the plan in March\u202f2024.

The carrier said it is \"executing a comprehensive restructuring of the airline to position the business for long\u2011term success.\" It confirmed that operations would continue, with a letter to guests stating \"The most important thing to know is that Spirit continues to operate and offer high\u2011value travel options.\" The reorganization plan focuses on four areas: (1) redesigning the network to concentrate on key markets, (2) rightsizing the fleet to match profitable demand, (3) addressing the cost structure to build on its low\u2011cost model, and (4) offering three new travel options \u2013 Spirit First, Premium Economy and Value. Spirit plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade 140 captains between Oct.\u202f1 and Nov.\u202f1, while maintaining a workforce of 11,000 employees.

Each cancellation could cost the airline more than US$2\u202fmillion per aircraft, threatening fleet renewal. The airline\u2019s shares fell 55\u202f% in pre\u2011market trading before settling at a 46\u202f% loss, trading at US$0.65 per share before the NYSE suspended trading at 4:30\u202fp.m. Despite the crisis, Spirit assured customers in a letter that the bankruptcy filing would not affect operations, tickets or loyalty programs. The carrier announced it will add two new destinations\u2014Belize and Grand Cayman\u2014from Fort Lauderdale. In its restructuring plan, Spirit will redesign its route network, reduce its presence in certain markets, and optimise fleet size. It also confirmed a US$2.9\u202fmillion retention incentive for CEO Dave\u202fDavis. The company\u2019s previous restructuring eliminated about US$795\u202fmillion of debt and required bondholders to inject additional capital, but the effort failed to move the airline away from its ultra\u2011low\u2011fare model. Spirit\u2019s bankruptcy filing comes amid talks with Frontier Group Holdings, whose shares rose 19\u202f% to US$5.84 after the news. Spirit had exited bankruptcy protection in March after a drop in air\u2011travel demand due to inflation fears and trade wars, and had warned investors a liquidity crunch could force it out of business. The airline had previously filed for bankruptcy in November\u202f2024 to restructure US$1.6\u202fbillion of debt, suffered a major engine defect that grounded part of its fleet, and faced a historic rise in labour costs following new agreements.

The filing lists assets and liabilities between $1\u202fbillion and $10\u202fbillion, and the company is negotiating with major lessors, secured noteholders and stakeholders. Shares fell sharply, dropping as much as 55% after hours and 46% to $0.65 before trading was halted at 4:30\u202fp.m. in New York. In a letter to customers, Spirit said the bankruptcy would not affect operations, tickets or its loyalty program, and that it would \"double down\" on cost\u2011cutting, network redesign and fleet optimization. The earlier restructuring had cut about $795\u202fmillion in debt and required bondholders to inject capital to support a shift away from a bare\u2011bone fare model. The new filing follows a day after Bloomberg reported that Spirit was in high\u2011level talks with Frontier Group Holdings Inc. about a potential merger; Frontier shares rose 19% to $5.84. Spirit emerged from its first bankruptcy in March amid a broader industry downturn. The airline had warned investors on Aug.\u202f11 that it might not survive without rapid cash infusions, and had tapped a $275\u202fmillion revolving line of credit, of which at least $50\u202fmillion went to US Bank, which threatened to cancel its credit\u2011card processing contract if Spirit did not provide more collateral. The November bankruptcy aimed to restructure about $1.6\u202fbillion in debt after the pandemic\u2011era downturn and competition from larger airlines. Additional challenges included an engine defect that grounded part of its fleet and high labor costs under new contracts. A 2022 takeover battle between JetBlue Airways Corp. and Frontier led to a $3.8\u202fbillion acquisition offer, which was blocked in January\u202f2024 on antitrust grounds.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 09:43 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/spirit-airlines-tumbles-after-filing-second-bankruptcy-in-a-year-11756503801097.html)\n\n**You May Soon Have One Fewer Option for a Low-Cost Flight**\nSpirit Airlines, an ultra-low-cost carrier, has warned that it may run out of money within 12 months.

The warning follows Spirit\u2019s Chapter\u202f11 bankruptcy filing in November\u202f2024 and its emergence on March\u202f13,\u202f2025, after a debt\u2011restructuring plan that projected a consolidated net profit of $252\u202fmillion for 2025. The airline has also been hit by a decline in U.S. travel demand after February\u202f2025 tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which, combined with rising inflation, led to cancellations and a flat profit outlook for U.S. majors.

However, the US Department of Justice, under the Biden administration, argued that the partnership would harm consumers by eliminating incentives for American Airlines to lower prices to attract customers from Jetblue, a competing airline with often lower fares.

This decision comes after years of economic losses and a complex landscape for the aviation sector following the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Derek Dombrowski, JetBlue's Director of Corporate Communications, 'This measure responds to a consolidation strategy to focus resources on more profitable routes.' The airline had operated up to 14 daily flights to MIA, but its presence has been reduced to one or two daily flights between Miami and Boston. JetBlue has reported significant losses, including a net loss of $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $208 million in the first quarter of 2025. The airline's attempt to expand through a merger with Spirit Airlines was also blocked by the US government due to antitrust concerns. Passengers with flights scheduled from or to MIA after September 3 will have two options: 'We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible experience, and we will continue to operate from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL), where we have a strong presence,' said a JetBlue spokesperson.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 25, 2025 02:05 AM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/respuestas/us/esta-famosa-aerolinea-le-dice-adios-al-aeropuerto-de-miami-lo-que-pasara-desde-el-3-de-septiembre-estados-unidos-nnda-nnlt-noticia/)\n\n**United Airlines and JetBlue Launch 'Blue Sky' Partnership**\nUnited Airlines and JetBlue Airways have announced a strategic partnership called 'Blue Sky' to offer passengers greater flexibility in booking and access to a wider network. This collaboration allows travelers to book flights on both airlines' websites and accumulate or redeem loyalty points interchangeably. Subject to regulatory approval, some aspects of the partnership may begin as early as autumn 2025. United Airlines will have up to seven daily slots at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) starting from 2027, marking its return to JFK after leaving in 2022. JetBlue will receive additional time slots at Newark Liberty International Airport, strengthening its presence at United's East Coast hub. United Airlines' CEO, Scott Kirby, has described the move as a mistake. The airline briefly returned to JFK in 2021 due to a decrease in traffic at the airport caused by COVID-19. United had to leave JFK in 2022 because it was unable to secure long-term slot allocations. The partnership highlights the integration of loyalty programs, allowing members of United's MileagePlus and JetBlue's TrueBlue to accumulate and redeem points on both airlines. Passengers with elite status can enjoy reciprocal benefits, including upgrades and flexibility in changing flights. The loyalty programs of airlines are becoming increasingly important revenue streams. During the COVID-19 pandemic, US airlines used these programs to generate revenue and raise funds. In 2023, United Airlines' loyalty program revenue reached $3.49 billion, a 10% increase from the previous year. The airline will increase lounge access fees to $1,400 starting from March 2025. Both airlines will maintain independent control over their flight operations, including schedules and prices. This approach distinguishes the 'Blue Sky' alliance from JetBlue's previous Northeast Alliance with American Airlines, which was dissolved in 2023 due to antitrust concerns. This is not the only setback United Airlines has faced regarding a collaboration. In 2024, a US federal judge blocked United Airlines' proposal to acquire low-cost carrier Spirit, citing that the deal would remove a low-cost carrier from the market. The implications of this partnership are strategic for both airlines. For United Airlines, it facilitates a strategic return to JFK, resolving previous operational issues at Newark and expanding its presence in the competitive New York market. JetBlue, on the other hand, gains greater access to Newark, aligning with its focus on leisure travel on the East Coast and efforts to overcome post-pandemic profitability challenges. In the last nine quarters, JetBlue has reported a profit only in two of them. The 'Blue Sky' alliance represents a significant step towards improving passenger comfort and expanding network connectivity for both United Airlines and JetBlue. While the partnership awaits regulatory approval, travelers can expect a more integrated and flexible flying experience in the future.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 01:18 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/it/notizie/2025/05/29/united-airlines-e-jetblue-lanciano-la-collaborazione-blue-sky/)\n\n",

They cite the formal abandonment of the deal by JetBlue in March 2024 following a federal antitrust court block, Spirit's deteriorating financial condition and multiple bankruptcies, unchanged or even more adverse regulatory and legal environments, and the strategic pivot of JetBlue toward partnership with United rather than pursuing Spirit. Experts consistently note the lack of any public or industry signals of renewed merger discussions or changing regulatory posture. The historical base rate for large airline mergers to be revived and completed within a short period after regulatory rejection is near zero. Even Spirit's financial distress is interpreted as more likely to lead to piecemeal asset sales, liquidations, or independent restructuring than to a renewed merger, especially under the compressed timeline (about 2.5 months left). All experts assign a final probability at or near 1% that the specific criterion\u2014a JetBlue press release or SEC filing announcing acquisition of Spirit before January 1, 2026\u2014will be met, and uniformly describe any 'Yes' scenario as highly improbable and requiring dramatic, currently unsupported reversals in policy, legal rulings, or market dynamics. The consensus is a strong expectation that the question will resolve 'No.'",
