There are signs of regime willingness to manipulate the process, and the risk of an opposition-mobilized protest vote is low given fragmentation and voter demoralization. However, the presence of former first lady Simone Gbagbo and other minor candidates, as well as regime sensitivity to international legitimacy, gives a small chance the regime will engineer a result just under 80%. Overall, the probability of Ouattara officially winning 80% or more is very high, but just below certainty due to these minor uncertainties.",

However, the current electoral context is highly uncompetitive: the main opposition figures (Gbagbo, Thiam) are barred, and the remaining candidates lack institutional backing and mass appeal. Gbagbo and his party are not endorsing any candidate and are calling for peaceful resistance, but not outright boycott, which may further demobilize the anti-Ouattara electorate. The state demonstrates both willingness and ability to manage the process and result. Recent base rates from the 2015 and especially 2020 elections (the latter with a boycott) suggest that 80%+ is entirely plausible, if not likely, under these conditions. The only significant uncertainty is whether protest voting or abstention will be strong enough, and whether the official results will reflect any such resistance. Given the historic precedent, regime control, opposition fragmentation, and the structure of the electoral system, the probability that Ouattara wins 80% or more is very high.",

The Council had shortlisted five candidates out of 60, including incumbent president Alassane Ouattara, Jean\u2011Louis Billon and Simone Ehivet, the ex\u2011wife of Gbagbo. Gbagbo, who is ineligible, saw his own candidacy rejected on 8\u202fSeptember. According to his spokesperson, Ma\u00eetre\u202fHabiba\u202fTour\u00e9, the selected candidates are not backed by the country\u2019s major parties, so there is no consensus or legitimacy for a unified strategy. Gbagbo therefore plans to pursue \u201cpeaceful and democratic actions\u201d to oppose a fourth term for Ouattara, while rejecting any challenge to the institutions. He argues that validating a fourth term and excluding 55 candidates\u2014including those from major opposition parties\u2014has violated the principle of equality before the law. The government\u2019s spokesperson, Amadou\u202fCoulibaly, reiterated that the Constitutional Council\u2019s decisions are final and that contesting them would be a legal violation.

The campaign will run from 18 September to 8 October 2025 and seeks to mobilise the 20 departments that make up the V baoul\u00e9, covering seven regions including B\u00e9lier, Iffou, N\u2019Zi and the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro. Founded on 7 December 2024 in Abidjan, the movement presents itself as a citizen platform that transcends partisan divides. It highlights Ouattara\u2019s ongoing development work, noting that \u2018pr\u00e8s de 3000 villages sont \u00e9lectrifi\u00e9s, des routes sont entretenues, des centres de sant\u00e9 et des \u00e9coles construits\u2019. The campaign counters opposition slogans \u2018Trop c\u2019est trop\u2019 with the rallying cry \u2018\u00c7a suffit\u2019 and calls on the central\u2011region population to support continued development. The election is scheduled for 25 October 2025, with the movement aiming for an \u2018\u00e9clatante\u2019 victory for Ouattara in the V baoul\u00e9.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 10:41 PM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/presidentielle-en-cote-d-ivoire-2025-ewan-ado-sur-le-terrain-pour-la-victoire-d-alassane-ouattara)\n\n**Ivory Coast: Eligibility of President Alassane Ouattara in 2020 and 2025**\nThe article explains that the debate over President Alassane Ouattara\u2019s eligibility for the 2025 presidential election has resurfaced, just as it did in 2020. It states that every candidate, including Ouattara, was examined by the Constitutional Council solely on the basis of the 2016 Ivorian Constitution and its derived texts (organic law, electoral code, complementary laws). The Council\u2019s decisions consistently reference the 2016 Constitution, saying, 'Vu la Constitution de 2016, vu la loi organique, vu le code \u00e9lectoral, vu la loi, vu le d\u00e9cret\u2026' (Evidence). To invalidate Ouattara\u2019s candidacy, one would have had to apply a different legal corpus, namely the 2000 Constitution, which the article argues is no longer legally valid: 'La Constitution de 2000 n\u2019a plus de valeur juridique et n\u2019est opposable \u00e0 personne.' (Evidence). The 2016 Constitution\u2019s Article\u202f183 guarantees institutional continuity but does not allow retroactive application of repealed provisions; Article\u202f55 incorporates a clause from Article\u202f35 of the 2000 Constitution only within the new constitutional framework. Thus, applying the 2000 Constitution to bar Ouattara would create an exceptional legal order. The article notes that the establishment of the Third Republic in 2016 introduced new eligibility conditions (ending age limits, creating a vice\u2011presidency) and effectively started a new constitutional cycle. The Constitutional Council validated Ouattara\u2019s candidacy in 2020 by treating the mandate count as starting from zero under the new republic, and the same reasoning applies to 2025, where the debate has not even been raised. The piece concludes that the controversy is less about positive law and more about political interpretations, as even opponents admit that an early election between 2016 and 2020 could have allowed Ouattara to run, implicitly recognizing the 2016 framework\u2019s reset of mandate counting.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 02:17 PM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/cote-divoire-de-leligibilite-du-president-alassane-ouattara-en-2020-et-2025)\n\n**Ouattara Confirms Candidacy for Fourth Term Amid Tension in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire**\nPresident Alassane Ouattara, 83, officially announced his candidacy for a fourth term in the 25 October 2025 presidential election, citing the need to confront unprecedented security, economic and monetary challenges. The announcement comes amid a fragile political climate, with key opposition leaders absent or in exile, strengthening Ouattara\u2019s position as the favored candidate. The decision raises concerns about national stability, echoing fears of a potential coup, especially after the 2021 military overthrow of Guinea\u2019s President Alpha Cond\u00e9, who had also sought a third term. The upcoming election is therefore seen as a critical test for Ivorian democracy and West\u2011African governance, where constitutional norms and popular demands for political alternation remain central issues.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 08:48 PM\nSource:[aminata.com](https://aminata.com/ouattara-confirme-sa-candidature-pour-un-4e-mandat-vers-une-cote-divoire-sous-tension/)\n\n**Ivory Coast polls: Laurent Gbagbo vows not to support any other candidate**\nFormer Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo has declared that he will not endorse any candidate in the upcoming presidential election, despite being declared ineligible to run.  Gbagbo stated that he will not support any of the candidates approved by the Constitutional Council, citing a lack of consensus and legitimacy among them.  His party spokesperson, Me Habiba Tour\u00e9, echoed this position, saying the candidates do not represent the larger political parties in the country.  Gbagbo, who has consistently opposed President Alassane Ouattara\u2019s bid for a fourth term, calls the situation a violation of constitutional law, noting that the Ivorian constitution limits presidents to two terms but the Council argues a 2016 constitution reset the term counter.  The article notes that political tensions are escalating as Gbagbo and opposition leader Tidjane Thiam are ineligible to participate due to legal and nationality issues.  Among the five qualified candidates is incumbent President Ouattara, along with others once allied with Gbagbo.  Gbagbo has called for 'democratic and peaceful actions' to contest Ouattara\u2019s fourth term, while government spokesperson Amadou Coulibaly warned that any challenges to the Constitutional Council\u2019s decisions would face legal consequences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[Africanews](https://www.africanews.com/2025/09/19/ivory-coast-polls-laurent-gbagbo-vows-not-to-support-any-other-candidate/)\n\n**Ivorian Presidential Election: Laurent Gbagbo Declares He Will Not Support Any Opposition Candidate**\nFormer Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo, declared ineligible by a court, announced on 18\u202fSeptember that he would not support any candidate in the upcoming 25\u202fOctober presidential election. He reiterated his opposition to a fourth term for incumbent Alassane Ouattara, who has been in power since 2011. Gbagbo said he had considered backing 'l'un des candidats retenus' but found no consensus or sufficient legitimacy for such a strategy. The Constitutional Council had already rejected the candidacies of Gbagbo and Tidjane\u202fThiam earlier in September, citing judicial decisions that render them ineligible.

The International Monetary Fund projects the country will approach the upper\u2011middle\u2011income threshold in the medium term, and rating agencies Standard\u202f&\u202fPoor\u2019s, Fitch and Moody\u2019s have upgraded the country to be among Africa\u2019s best after Botswana, Mauritius and Morocco. The average annual growth rate from 2012 to 2023 was 6.9\u202f%, surpassing crises such as the COVID\u201119 pandemic and the post\u20112010 election violence. Infrastructure has expanded with new ports in San\u202fPedro and Abidjan, bridges, roads and stadiums, and the country hosted the 2024 Africa Cup of Nations. Electricity access rose from 55.8\u202f% in 2012 to 72.4\u202f% in 2023, while renewable energy now accounts for 30\u202f% of the mix, making the country\u2019s tariffs the cheapest in the region. Mobile\u2011phone penetration and mobile\u2011payment services grew, although the sector was hit in 2024 when four of five submarine cables were cut. Abidjan attracted billions of AF\u202ffrancs in investment from Moroccan, Singaporean, French and Senegalese firms, and companies from Mali and Burkina Faso moved to the country for a more stable environment. Oil and gas production began with the Balin field in August\u202f2023. Public debt climbed from 24.6\u202f% of GDP in 2012 to 58.1\u202f% in 2025, but rating agencies consider it manageable because the deficit fell to 4\u202f% in 2024. Poverty fell from 55\u202f% in 2011 to 37.5\u202f% in 2021, yet rural inequalities persist and the informal sector still represents 40\u202f% of GDP and 80\u202f% of jobs. The Transparency International index rose from 35/100 in 2019 to 45/100 in 2024, but remains below leading African countries. Agriculture remains the world\u2019s largest producer of cocoa and cashew, with progress in local manufacturing, yet climate change, supply\u2011chain disruptions and the need to import half of rice continue to challenge the sector. Africa Report concludes that Ouattara\u2019s economic legacy combines clear growth and investment gains with shortcomings in reducing inequalities and achieving balanced social development.

Thus, applying the 2000 Constitution to bar Ouattara would create an exceptional legal order. The article notes that the establishment of the Third Republic in 2016 introduced new eligibility conditions (ending age limits, creating a vice\u2011presidency) and effectively started a new constitutional cycle. The Constitutional Council validated Ouattara\u2019s candidacy in 2020 by treating the mandate count as starting from zero under the new republic, and the same reasoning applies to 2025, where the debate has not even been raised. The piece concludes that the controversy is less about positive law and more about political interpretations, as even opponents admit that an early election between 2016 and 2020 could have allowed Ouattara to run, implicitly recognizing the 2016 framework\u2019s reset of mandate counting.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 02:17 PM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/cote-divoire-de-leligibilite-du-president-alassane-ouattara-en-2020-et-2025)\n\n**RHDP Membership Surge in Grand\u2011Ponts Attributed to Minister Silas Metch**\nOn Saturday 6 September 2025, a new wave of memberships in the Rassemblement des Houphou\u00ebtistes pour la D\u00e9mocratie et la Paix (RHDP) was recorded in the Grand\u2011Ponts region. According to a note, several opposition militants, all registered on electoral lists, officially joined the ruling party. The move is said to be driven by attraction to President Alassane Ouattara's vision and by the on\u2011the\u2011ground actions of Minister Silas Metch. New members expressed support for the RHDP's values of 'stability, development and future'. Minister Metch, presented as a key actor in Ivorian sports victories and as a representative of the Grand\u2011Ponts populations, has been conducting a series of meetings in the area for several weeks. His supporters portray his work as a vehicle for reconciliation and social cohesion. The growth of RHDP cadres in this 'sensitive' region is described as 'steady and continuous' in both urban and rural settings. This momentum comes amid preparations for the October 2025 presidential election. Locally, the RHDP is coordinated by Vincent Lohou\u00e8s, minister\u2011governor of the Lagunes autonomous district, who relies on territorial anchors like Metch to consolidate the party's base. The spokesperson for the new members praised 'the groundwork laid by the President' and 'the remarkable efforts of Minister Silas Metch for development and cohesion in the region'.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 11:50 AM\nSource:[afrikipresse.fr](https://www.afrikipresse.fr/article/adhesions-au-rhdp-dans-les-grands-ponts-une-dynamique-attribuee-a-laction-du-ministre-silas-metch)\n\n**Simone Gbagbo\u2019s Candidacy Validated \u2013 Will the Former First\u2011Lady Re\u2011enter Ivory Coast\u2019s Political Spotlight?**\nSimone Gbagbo, 76, former first\u2011lady of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, has been approved by the Constitutional Council as one of five candidates for the presidential election on 25\u202fOctober. She will run against incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, 83, who seized power after the 2010 post\u2011election crisis. Former president Laurent Gbagbo, former prime minister Pascal Affi N\u2019Guessan and former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam were disqualified, raising doubts about the vote\u2019s legitimacy. Thiam called the decision an \u2018acte de vandalisme d\u00e9mocratique\u2019 and accused Ouattara of orchestrating a \u2018\u00e9lection truqu\u00e9e\u2019. Ouattara won the 2020 election with a landslide after a 2016 constitutional amendment allowed him to run again; the vote was boycotted by the opposition and 85 people were killed in the ensuing unrest. Laurent Gbagbo was barred from running because of a 2018 conviction for looting the central bank; he was later amnestied in 2020 but remains ineligible to run. Simone Gbagbo, who was sentenced to 20\u202fyears in 2015 and later amnestied, has rebuilt a political base after leaving the FPI. Only 30\u202f% of Ivorian parliamentarians are women. She is seen as a symbol of female leadership; Severin Yao Kouam\u00e9s said, \u2018Son approbation l\u00e9gitime l\u2019id\u00e9e que les femmes ivoiriennes peuvent aspirer \u00e0 la plus haute fonction, quels que soient leur pass\u00e9, leur \u00e2ge ou leur sexe.

Of 60 dossiers, only five were accepted. The council validated incumbent President Alassane Ouattara for a fourth term, while former presidents Laurent Gbagbo and Tidjane\u202fThiam were excluded. Gbagbo had been sentenced to 20\u202fyears in 2018 for the 2010\u20112011 bank\u2011robbery case and was barred from re\u2011entry without a presidential amnesty; Thiam lost Ivorian citizenship in 1987 when he acquired French nationality, leading to his removal from the list. Opposition leaders, including Simon\u202fDoho of the PDCI, complained that the council failed to enforce the law, saying 'Nous avions l'espoir que le droit serait dit, mais le Conseil constitutionnel, cens\u00e9 \u00eatre le temple de la loi et garant de son ex\u00e9cution, n'a pas jou\u00e9 son r\u00f4le'. The council justified the exclusions by citing the absence of the two candidates on the electoral roll. The article notes that the Ivorian government has earmarked \u20ac85\u202fmillion of the \u20ac23.3\u202fbillion 2025 budget for election expenses, compared with the UNDP's $8.3\u202fmillion mobilised in 2015 and a peak of $52\u202fmillion in 2010. It also reports that several opposition activists have been arrested in recent weeks, a move the opposition says is aimed at silencing dissent. The article concludes that Ouattara, who came to power in 2011 with French military support, faces no serious challengers, even within his own party, the RHDP.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 03:49 PM\nSource:[Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/international/090925/la-cote-d-ivoire-se-prepare-la-reelection-d-alassane-ouattara)\n\n**Ivory Coast bars ex-Credit Suisse chief Tidjane Thiam from presidential race**\nThe article reports that former Credit Suisse chief Tidjane Thiam and former President Laurent Gbagbo have been barred from contesting the September 2025 presidential election in Ivory Coast, while Gbagbo's ex\u2011wife Simone Gbagbo is still eligible, an official said on Monday. The article states that President Alassane Ouattara, 83, announced in July that he would seek a fourth term, and analysts expect him to win given the weak field of challengers. It also notes that Thiam, the designated candidate of the main opposition party PDCI, was expected to be excluded after a court ruling in April that removed him from the electoral roll because he was a French national at the time of registration. Ivory Coast law requires candidates to be Ivorian citizens and not hold another nationality. The government has promised a peaceful vote amid tensions over eligibility that could fuel unrest. The article includes the following direct quotes: 'Former Credit Suisse chief Tidjane Thiam and former President Laurent Gbagbo are barred from contesting next month's presidential election in Ivory Coast, although Gbagbo's ex-wife, Simone Gbagbo, will be able to run, an official said on Monday.'

The incumbent, 83\u2011year\u2011old President Alassane Dramane Ouattara (RHDP), is running for a fourth consecutive term, a move that has sparked controversy and raised questions about constitutional limits. The Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) has received about sixty applications, including those of former opposition leaders Laurent Gbagbo and Tidjane Thiam, who have been declared ineligible; the CEI will forward the list to the Constitutional Council, which will publish the final candidate list on 10 September. The electorate consists of 8.7\u202fmillion registered voters (June\u202f2025), all Ivorian nationals aged 18 or older who enjoy their civil and political rights, as defined in Article\u202f55 of the 2016 Constitution. The election follows a two\u2011round, single\u2011member, majority\u2011vote system: a candidate must secure an absolute majority of valid votes to win outright; otherwise a runoff between the top two candidates is held fifteen days after the first\u2011round results are announced. Voting is conducted by paper ballot in a single ballot box, with voters stamping their fingerprints to prevent fraud; results are counted publicly with observers present.\n\nThe guide also outlines the broader political, economic, and security context. Ivory Coast has experienced the fastest growth in West Africa (average 6\u20117\u202f% per year since 2012), yet regional and social inequalities persist. The cocoa sector, which accounts for 40\u202f% of exports, has been hit by price volatility and disease, threatening farmers\u2019 incomes. Youth unemployment remains high, with over 70\u202f% of the population under 35. Debt servicing for infrastructure projects poses a sustainability challenge. Security concerns include jihadist activity and porous borders with Burkina Faso, which could destabilise the election.\n\nHistorically, no Ivorian presidential election has resulted in a peaceful alternation of power since 1995. The exclusion of prominent opposition figures and Ouattara\u2019s bid for a fourth term may reignite tensions. The credibility of the CEI, the Constitutional Council, and the judiciary will be closely scrutinised, especially in how they handle candidate disqualifications and contested results. The article stresses the need for a transparent, inclusive process to prevent post\u2011electoral violence, recalling the 2010\u20112011 crisis that caused about 3\u202f000 deaths when Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept defeat.\n\nKey metrics: 8.7\u202fmillion voters; 6\u20117\u202f% annual growth; 40\u202f% of exports from cocoa; 3\u202f000 deaths in 2010\u20112011 crisis. Key dates: 25\u202fOct\u202f2025 (first round), 29\u202fNov\u202f2025 (possible second round), 10\u202fSep\u202f2025 (final candidate list).

Among the contenders are former president Laurent Gbagbo, former Credit Suisse chief Tidjane Thiam, and incumbent president Alassane Ouattara, who is 83 and seeking a fourth term. Supporters of Thiam claim, 'Notre pr\u00e9sident Tidjane remplit toutes les conditions pour \u00eatre candidat', while a Thiam party activist says, 'que ce sera notre prochain pr\u00e9sident de la r\u00e9publique de C\u00f4te d'Ivoire'. A supporter of Gbagbo states, 'c'est le candidat du peuple. Il n'y a rien \u00e0 dire'. Ouattara\u2019s backers highlight his experience, noting that former president Houphou\u00ebt Boigny 'a pu diriger le pays jusqu'\u00e0 ses derniers jours', and argue that Ouattara can do the same. The Constitutional Council will review the dossiers and issue a verdict; the campaign will begin two weeks before the election.

This will be his fourth bid for the presidency, and a victory would secure his fourth consecutive term since 2010. Ouattara's rise to power was not without controversy, as he defeated Laurent Gbagbo in the 2010 election, but Gbagbo refused to accept the result, leading to a second civil war in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Ouattara's presidency has been marked by economic growth, with the country's GDP increasing from $34 billion in 2010 to over $80 billion today, making it the second-largest economy in West Africa. However, Ouattara has also faced criticism for his handling of protests in 2020, which resulted in 85 deaths, and for his government's treatment of opposition politicians, including Guillaume Soro, who has been forced into exile. The opposition is fragmented and weakened, and Ouattara's candidacy is seen as a strong favorite for the election. 'La llave de la paz en Costa de Marfil consist\u00eda en no pisotear a los sure\u00f1os, ni dar alas a los temores que les susurraban que la presidencia de Ouattara traer\u00eda un vuelco en las din\u00e1micas de poder establecidas,' said a journalist who has spoken to sources in the north of the country.

The announcement comes amid a fragile political climate, with key opposition leaders absent or in exile, strengthening Ouattara\u2019s position as the favored candidate. The decision raises concerns about national stability, echoing fears of a potential coup, especially after the 2021 military overthrow of Guinea\u2019s President Alpha Cond\u00e9, who had also sought a third term. The upcoming election is therefore seen as a critical test for Ivorian democracy and West\u2011African governance, where constitutional norms and popular demands for political alternation remain central issues.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 08:48 PM\nSource:[aminata.com](https://aminata.com/ouattara-confirme-sa-candidature-pour-un-4e-mandat-vers-une-cote-divoire-sous-tension/)\n\n**Alassane Ouattara's Bid for Fourth Term Sparks Concerns Over Authoritarianism**\nAlassane Ouattara, the economist turned president of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, is running for a fourth consecutive term, despite being accused of authoritarian tendencies by his detractors. Ouattara, 83, has been the leader of the majority and a favorite to win the presidential election on October 25, with his opponents excluded from the election due to court decisions. Ouattara has a long history of involvement in politics, having served as Prime Minister in 1990 and later becoming president in 2010 after a disputed election. He has been praised for his economic policies, which have led to significant growth and investment in the country. However, critics argue that Ouattara's rule has been marked by corruption, inequality, and a lack of accountability. Ouattara's opponents, including Laurent Gbagbo, have been excluded from the election, and Ouattara has been accused of dictating the tempo of the political game. Ouattara has said that he will not amnistier his rival, leaving him out of the presidential election in 2025. 'If we don't let others have the capacity to fight for power, it's no longer democracy,' Gbagbo said.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 05:23 PM\nSource:[DAKARACTU.COM](https://www.dakaractu.com/Alassane-Ouattara-l-economiste-devenu-incontournable-president-en-Cote-d-Ivoire_a263785.html)\n\n**Ivory Coast on the Brink of a New Cycle of Electoral Violence?**\nAs the presidential election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire approaches on October 25, 2025, the country is plagued by rumors of a coup spread on social media. Videos and messages, mainly in English, claimed that President Alassane Ouattara had been overthrown and that major unrest was sweeping Abidjan. However, the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) quickly denied these allegations, calling them 'false and totally unfounded', and highlighting that they resulted from a 'deliberate and coordinated disinformation campaign'. The Ivorian authorities have called on the population to be vigilant and to refer only to official sources for information. No tangible evidence has been provided to support these rumors, and no major incidents have been reported on the ground. A tense political climate is approaching the elections The Ivorian political context is marked by growing tensions as the presidential election approaches. The potential candidacy of outgoing President Alassane Ouattara for a fourth term has sparked controversy. The 2016 Ivorian Constitution limits the number of presidential terms to two, but Ouattara was re-elected for a third term in 2020, invoking that the new Constitution reset the term counter. Furthermore, opposition leader Tidjane Thiam, a prominent figure of the Democratic Party of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (PDCI), was disqualified from the presidential race in April 2025 due to his dual French-Ivorian nationality. Although he renounced his French nationality in February 2025, the justice deemed that he did not meet the eligibility conditions at the time of his registration on the electoral lists. Contested candidacies and a fragmented opposition In addition to Tidjane Thiam, other major political figures are at the heart of the debates. Laurent Gbagbo, former president, has been designated as a candidate by his party despite his current ineligibility. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Vincent Toh Bi Iri\u00e9, former prefect of Abidjan, is running as an independent, while Jean-Louis Billon, former minister, has confirmed his candidacy. This multiplicity of candidacies, often from the opposition, reflects a political fragmentation that could complicate the formation of a united alternative to the ruling power. Calls for calm and initiatives for peace In the face of these tensions, initiatives aimed at promoting peace and social cohesion are multiplying. On May 24, 2025, an interconfessional conference was held in Abidjan, bringing together Christian and Muslim religious leaders to promote non-violence and national unity ahead of the elections. On the other hand, the UN, through its special envoy for West Africa and the Sahel, Leonardo Santos Sim\u00e3o, met with the main Ivorian political actors in April 2025 to urge them to prioritize dialogue and avoid any escalation of violence. Thus, as the 2025 presidential election approaches, vigilance, respect for institutions, and dialogue between the different stakeholders will be essential to ensure a peaceful and transparent election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[tunisienumerique.com](https://www.tunisienumerique.com/vers-un-nouveau-cycle-de-violence-electorale-en-cote-divoire/)\n\n**Ivory Coast on the Brink of a New Cycle of Electoral Violence?**\nIvory Coast is facing a tense political climate ahead of the presidential election on October 25, 2025.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is near-unanimous consensus that Alassane Ouattara is extremely likely to win 80% or more of the official vote in the first round of the 2025 Ivorian presidential election. This high probability is driven by several converging factors: the systematic exclusion of all credible opposition candidates (notably Gbagbo and Thiam), the fragmentation and demobilization of the remaining opposition, explicit non-endorsement from key opposition figures, Ouattara's regime control over electoral and state institutions, and African and Ivorian base rates for incumbent victories in similarly uncompetitive or boycotted elections, with precedents from 2015 (83.7%) and 2020 (94.3%). Experts highlighted that, in contexts where opposition is coerced, excluded, or boycotted, official results are routinely engineered to deliver overwhelming victories for the incumbent. The only marginally moderating factors considered were regime sensitivity to international legitimacy and the risk of widespread unrest, which could incentivize officials to report a result slightly below the 80% threshold; however, these scenarios were viewed as low likelihood given Ouattara's demonstrated willingness to absorb criticism. Final probability estimates for a 'Yes' outcome ranged from 85% to 97%, with most clustered at or above 90%. In summary, unless there is an unexpected surge in protest voting, disruptive unrest, or a last-minute regime calculation to moderate the result, official tallies giving Ouattara 80% or more are considered extremely likely by all expert panels.",
