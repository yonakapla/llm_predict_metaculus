There's no plausible scenario for a regulatory Lazarus act in the remaining timeframe. Anyone suggesting otherwise is misunderstanding both the administrative state and regulatory inertia. Zero is the only logical and evidence-based forecast here."

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nIn April 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a [final rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes) banning most non-compete agreements in the United States, claiming that this would generate over 8,500 new businesses each year, raise worker wages, lower health care costs, and boost innovation. The rule would prohibit employers from entering into or enforcing non-compete clauses with workers, including employees and independent contractors, with limited exceptions for senior executives. Employers would be required to rescind existing non-compete agreements and notify affected workers that such clauses are no longer in effect.\n\nThe rule was scheduled to take effect on September 4, 2024, however, on August 20, 2024, Judge Ada Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas [blocked the rule](https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2024/10/11/after-judge-blocks-ftcs-worker-non-compete-ban-now-what/) nationwide, ruling that the FTC lacked the statutory authority to implement such a ban and that the rule was \"arbitrary and capricious\". On October 18, 2024, the FTC [filed an appeal](https://www.psca.org/news/psca-news/2024/10/where-does-the-ftcs-non-compete-ban-stand-now/) with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":31227,\"question_id\":30897}}`",

It also applies to both existing and future non-compete agreements.\n\nMinor changes are defined as amendments in the current exceptions that affect less than 10% of workers under FTC's jurisdiction (as judged by Metaculus), as changes to the notice requirements employers should give to their employees, or other changes of a similar scope as judged by Metaculus admins.\n\nIf the rule is not enacted before January 1, 2026 or if it is enacted with other changes, including but not limited to changes that affect at least 10% of workers or changes to if the rule would be applied to existing contracts at all, would resolve this question as **No**.",

The event follows the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) decision to ban its recent non\u2011compete rule and to withdraw all appeals related to that ban, a move that has left employers and counsel facing a patchwork of inconsistent state laws across the country. James Gale, Co\u2011Chair of Intellectual Property Litigation at Cozen O'Connor, will lead the discussion, offering practical guidance on navigating the post\u2011FTC environment, assessing the impact on existing agreements, and exploring alternative contractual strategies. The agenda includes an overview of the FTC\u2019s prior rule and its current status, anticipated litigation trends, recent state\u2011law changes affecting non\u2011compete enforcement, implications for existing agreements, alternative protective measures for confidential information and trade secrets, drafting enforceable non\u2011solicitation and non\u2011disclosure agreements, and compliance strategies for multi\u2011state employers.

First, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed new rules that would change the enrollment period, add verification requirements, eliminate certain recipients, and roll back tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Center for American Progress says these changes increase costs for people with ACA marketplace coverage and shrink enrollment. Second, the Department of Transportation (DOT) rescinded a Biden rule that required cash refunds for delayed flights and a rule that required disclosure of baggage and other fees. Airline industry groups welcomed the change, while passenger groups warned it could raise air\u2011travel costs. Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of AirHelp, said, 'To revert back now will hinder the air travel experience and leave millions of travelers without adequate compensation in the event of a disruption.' Third, the administration rescinded a Biden executive order that capped out\u2011of\u2011pocket drug costs at pharmacies and lowered prices for Medicare beneficiaries. The HHS secretary was directed to select payment models for specific drugs and submit a report within 90 days. Supporters said it could further cap prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. Fourth, a federal judge overturned a Biden policy that kept medical debt off credit reports, a rule that was designed to relieve the burden of health\u2011care expenses affecting nearly one\u2011third of Americans. The ruling was seen as a major blow to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and could make it harder for some Americans to obtain credit. Fifth, the administration rescinded a Biden executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour (or $10.50 for tipped workers) from $10.95 or $7.65. The order was already facing lawsuits and is still litigated. If the change sticks, federal contractors may see less income than they would have otherwise.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 10:55 AM\nSource:[GOBankingRates](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/economy/policies-us-rolled-back-so-far-2025-how-affects-money/)\n\n**FTC Walks Away From Rulemaking -- But Not The Fight On Non-Competes**\nOn September 5, 2025, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shifted its strategy on non\u2011compete agreements by voting 3\u20111 to abandon the Non\u2011Compete Clause Rule, a regulation that had banned most non\u2011compete clauses nationwide. The decision followed the FTC\u2019s voluntary dismissal of appeals in two lawsuits\u2014Ryan, LLC v. FTC (5th Cir.) and Properties of the Villages, Inc. v. FTC (11th Cir.)\u2014which had issued nationwide injunctions against the Rule. Commissioner Holyoak and Chairman Ferguson stated that the Rule was \"patently obvious\" illegal, arguing that the FTC lacked authority to preempt state law and that it would \"render categorically unlawful a species of contract that has been lawful since the eighteenth century.\" Ferguson also warned that the FTC would continue to enforce antitrust laws against non\u2011compete agreements on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis under Section\u00a05 of the FTC Act.\n\nCommissioner Meador concurred, calling the Rule overbroad and noting that economic considerations require a balanced approach. Commissioner Slaughter dissented, citing potential harms such as barriers to worker mobility, wage suppression, and stifled innovation, and urged the FTC to follow the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s notice\u2011and\u2011comment process before withdrawing the Rule.\n\nThe Rule had been promulgated on April\u00a023,\u00a02024 after a January\u00a05,\u00a02023 notice\u2011and\u2011comment period. It applied prospectively and retrospectively, preempting state non\u2011compete laws except those more restrictive. The Rule was originally adopted by a 3\u20112 party\u2011line vote and was scheduled to take effect in September\u00a02024, but was stayed by injunctions in the Ryan and Properties cases. The Ryan Court\u2019s August\u00a020,\u00a02024 ruling set the Rule aside nationwide, finding it violated the APA because the FTC lacked statutory authority and the Rule was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nDespite the Rule\u2019s repeal, the FTC remains focused on non\u2011compete enforcement. Chairman Ferguson has directed a Joint Labor Task Force and issued a Request for Information to assess the scope and effects of non\u2011compete agreements. In September\u00a02025, the FTC sent letters to large healthcare employers urging them to eliminate unfair or anticompetitive non\u2011competes, especially in rural areas. The agency also targeted Gateway Services, Inc., the largest pet cremation business, for broad non\u2011compete agreements that allegedly stifled job mobility and competition. The proposed consent order would require Gateway to stop enforcing existing non\u2011competes and prohibit future agreements.\n\nOverall, the FTC\u2019s strategy has moved from a blanket ban to a more tailored, case\u2011by\u2011case enforcement approach, while continuing to monitor and address non\u2011compete agreements that may harm competition and workers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 09:10 AM\nSource:[Mondaq Business Briefing](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/employee-rights-labour-relations/1683444/ftc-walks-away-from-rulemaking-but-not-the-fight-on-non-competes)\n\n**\"Preparatory steps\" don't breach non-compete clauses**\nOn September 26\u202f2025 the Fair Work Commission\u2019s full bench ruled that employees who take preparatory steps to set up a competing business while still employed are unlikely to breach fiduciary or contractual obligations. The bench said, 'The fiduciary and contractual obligations of employees do not provide an absolute bar to employees who may wish to make preparations for the establishment of a competitive business whilst remaining in the service of their existing employer.' The decision followed Commissioner Benjamin Redford\u2019s hearing of a case in which Plumbtrax\u202fPty\u202fLtd dismissed an employee in December\u202f2024 for alleged serious misconduct, claiming the employee had created and registered his own business and promoted it using the employer\u2019s resources during work time. The bench refused the employer\u2019s unfair dismissal appeal, concluding that the employee\u2019s preparatory activities did not constitute a breach of non\u2011compete clauses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[hrdaily.com.au](https://www.hrdaily.com.au/news/preparatory-steps-don-t-breach-non-compete-clauses-12941)\n\n**No Unbudgeted Spending: Government Imposes Tough New Measures to Curb Overspending**\nThe Zimbabwean government has issued Treasury Circular\u00a010 of\u00a02025, imposing strict spending controls that require all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to operate strictly within the 2025 Approved Budget. Treasury says that years of unplanned spending have eroded budget credibility and widened the fiscal deficit, so any unbudgeted expenditure will now be considered void and subject to penalties. A key provision is that any contract worth US$2\u202fmillion or more must receive prior written approval from Treasury; contracts below that threshold must stay within the current year\u2019s budget allocation, and contracts signed outside these rules will not be honoured. Workshops, conferences and foreign travel are largely suspended for the remainder of 2025, with training limited to government facilities such as ZIPAM and PSC Academies and events held close to participants to cut transport costs. Special per diem rates have been abolished, and vehicle hiring for MDAs funded from the Consolidated Revenue Fund is banned; pool vehicles must be logged and audited every two weeks. A general recruitment freeze is introduced, except for critical sectors such as health, education and security, and all institutions funded from the Consolidated Revenue Fund must migrate to the Salary Service Bureau payroll system immediately to enhance transparency. Fuel allocations to all government institutions have been cut by 25\u202f%, and capital expenditure is restricted to only three categories of projects: high\u2011impact projects driving growth or reducing life\u2011risk, protective works, and ongoing projects with existing payment commitments.

The Ministry of Social Security is finalising a formula to reverse the block caused by the new partial\u2011retirement regime that entered into force on 1\u202fApril. The last tripartite pension agreement, reached a little over a year ago, introduced changes that did not consider the impact on public\u2011sector labour staff. The new rule requires that a releaser be hired permanently, full\u2011time, and remain employed for at least two years after the partial\u2011retirement process ends. This rigidity has made it difficult for administrations to create fixed positions, leading to a backlog that previously could be resolved by hiring temporary staff. According to the article, there were about 250,000 labour contracts in the administration in 2024, and the total public workforce was 3.5\u202fmillion, of which 981,000 were temporary, giving a temporary rate of almost 28\u202f%. The EU Court of Justice, in a 13\u202fJune\u202f2024 ruling, declared that successive temporary contracts in the public sector constitute abuse and urged administrations to convert them to permanent contracts or provide deterrent compensation. The Supreme Court has submitted a question to the Court of Justice about the procedure for long\u2011duration interim staff, which could clarify the application of the ruling. The Ministry says it will wait for an agreement with social partners before finalising the solution, but sources say the plan is to keep the old rule for a transitional period until public administrations can fill the positions with permanent staff. Sources quoted the plan as: 'La idea es mantener la norma anterior durante un periodo de tiempo', indicating that the temporary window is intended to allow administrations to recruit permanent staff once the new regulations are fully implemented.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 08:38 PM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/economia/politica/2025/09/28/68d99c9e468aebac118b4583.html)\n\n**The Knowledge Group Has Scheduled a Live Webcast on U.S. Non-Compete Agreements Post-FTC: What Employers and Counsel Need to Know - PR.com**\nThe Knowledge Group announced a live webcast titled 'The Knowledge Group Has Scheduled a Live Webcast on U.S. Non-Compete Agreements Post-FTC: What Employers and Counsel Need to Know' that will take place on Tuesday, October 14, 2025, from 12:00\u202fPM to 1:00\u202fPM (ET). The event follows the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) decision to ban its recent non\u2011compete rule and to withdraw all appeals related to that ban, a move that has left employers and counsel facing a patchwork of inconsistent state laws across the country. James Gale, Co\u2011Chair of Intellectual Property Litigation at Cozen O'Connor, will lead the discussion, offering practical guidance on navigating the post\u2011FTC environment, assessing the impact on existing agreements, and exploring alternative contractual strategies.

First, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed new rules that would change the enrollment period, add verification requirements, eliminate certain recipients, and roll back tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Center for American Progress says these changes increase costs for people with ACA marketplace coverage and shrink enrollment. Second, the Department of Transportation (DOT) rescinded a Biden rule that required cash refunds for delayed flights and a rule that required disclosure of baggage and other fees. Airline industry groups welcomed the change, while passenger groups warned it could raise air\u2011travel costs. Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of AirHelp, said, 'To revert back now will hinder the air travel experience and leave millions of travelers without adequate compensation in the event of a disruption.' Third, the administration rescinded a Biden executive order that capped out\u2011of\u2011pocket drug costs at pharmacies and lowered prices for Medicare beneficiaries. The HHS secretary was directed to select payment models for specific drugs and submit a report within 90 days. Supporters said it could further cap prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. Fourth, a federal judge overturned a Biden policy that kept medical debt off credit reports, a rule that was designed to relieve the burden of health\u2011care expenses affecting nearly one\u2011third of Americans. The ruling was seen as a major blow to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and could make it harder for some Americans to obtain credit. Fifth, the administration rescinded a Biden executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour (or $10.50 for tipped workers) from $10.95 or $7.65. The order was already facing lawsuits and is still litigated. If the change sticks, federal contractors may see less income than they would have otherwise.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 10:55 AM\nSource:[GOBankingRates](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/economy/policies-us-rolled-back-so-far-2025-how-affects-money/)\n\n**FTC Walks Away From Rulemaking -- But Not The Fight On Non-Competes**\nOn September 5, 2025, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shifted its strategy on non\u2011compete agreements by voting 3\u20111 to abandon the Non\u2011Compete Clause Rule, a regulation that had banned most non\u2011compete clauses nationwide. The decision followed the FTC\u2019s voluntary dismissal of appeals in two lawsuits\u2014Ryan, LLC v. FTC (5th Cir.) and Properties of the Villages, Inc. v. FTC (11th Cir.)\u2014which had issued nationwide injunctions against the Rule. Commissioner Holyoak and Chairman Ferguson stated that the Rule was \"patently obvious\" illegal, arguing that the FTC lacked authority to preempt state law and that it would \"render categorically unlawful a species of contract that has been lawful since the eighteenth century.\" Ferguson also warned that the FTC would continue to enforce antitrust laws against non\u2011compete agreements on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis under Section\u00a05 of the FTC Act.\n\nCommissioner Meador concurred, calling the Rule overbroad and noting that economic considerations require a balanced approach. Commissioner Slaughter dissented, citing potential harms such as barriers to worker mobility, wage suppression, and stifled innovation, and urged the FTC to follow the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s notice\u2011and\u2011comment process before withdrawing the Rule.\n\nThe Rule had been promulgated on April\u00a023,\u00a02024 after a January\u00a05,\u00a02023 notice\u2011and\u2011comment period. It applied prospectively and retrospectively, preempting state non\u2011compete laws except those more restrictive. The Rule was originally adopted by a 3\u20112 party\u2011line vote and was scheduled to take effect in September\u00a02024, but was stayed by injunctions in the Ryan and Properties cases. The Ryan Court\u2019s August\u00a020,\u00a02024 ruling set the Rule aside nationwide, finding it violated the APA because the FTC lacked statutory authority and the Rule was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nDespite the Rule\u2019s repeal, the FTC remains focused on non\u2011compete enforcement. Chairman Ferguson has directed a Joint Labor Task Force and issued a Request for Information to assess the scope and effects of non\u2011compete agreements. In September\u00a02025, the FTC sent letters to large healthcare employers urging them to eliminate unfair or anticompetitive non\u2011competes, especially in rural areas. The agency also targeted Gateway Services, Inc., the largest pet cremation business, for broad non\u2011compete agreements that allegedly stifled job mobility and competition. The proposed consent order would require Gateway to stop enforcing existing non\u2011competes and prohibit future agreements.\n\nOverall, the FTC\u2019s strategy has moved from a blanket ban to a more tailored, case\u2011by\u2011case enforcement approach, while continuing to monitor and address non\u2011compete agreements that may harm competition and workers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 09:10 AM\nSource:[Mondaq Business Briefing](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/employee-rights-labour-relations/1683444/ftc-walks-away-from-rulemaking-but-not-the-fight-on-non-competes)\n\n**Student Loan Update: Trump Admin Faces New Lawsuit Over Forgiveness Student loan update: Trump admin faces new lawsuit over forgiveness**\nOn September 16, 2025, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) filed a request for class certification and a preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and Secretary Linda McMahon unlawfully delayed or shut down income\u2011driven repayment (IDR) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) relief. The complaint cites an IDR backlog of more than 1.08\u202fmillion pending applications as of August\u202f31,\u202f2025, and 74,510 pending PSLF Buyback requests, with only 5,600 decisions in August. AFT argues that these delays could push IDR discharges past December\u202f31,\u202f2025, when the current federal tax exemption expires; discharges dated January\u202f1,\u202f2026 or later would become taxable, while PSLF discharges remain tax\u2011free.\n\nThe lawsuit coincides with ED\u2019s proposed PSLF rules that would allow the Secretary to deem employers ineligible if their activities involve a \u2018substantial illegal purpose\u2019. NASFAA senior policy analyst Megan Walter warned that granting the Secretary unilateral authority to make such determinations \u201cwithout a court finding\u201d undermines due\u2011process and could create a legal limbo for borrowers and employers. Walter urged the Department to rely on existing judicial and IRS determinations and to include detailed due\u2011process procedures.\n\nED\u2019s stance, announced in April, is to resume aggressive collections on defaulted federal loans, framing forgiveness as a taxpayer burden. This approach clashes with AFT\u2019s focus on ensuring timely, lawful processing of statutory relief. AFT\u2019s claim of \u2018irreparable harm\u2019 is bolstered by the risk that borrowers who qualify for cancellation may face wage garnishment or offsets while their IDR/PSLF applications remain pending.\n\nKey dates: AFT filed its suit on March\u202f19,\u202f2025; ED paused IDR intake around February\u202f26, reopened on March\u202f26; a July\u202f14 letter confirmed monthly status reports on the backlog. The court will hear AFT\u2019s preliminary\u2011injunction and class\u2011certification motions on October\u202f31,\u202f2025, potentially affecting borrowers seeking IDR cancellation before 2026.\n\nQuotes: \u2018I think the most significant legal risk is granting the Secretary of Education what NASFAA sees as unilateral authority to determine that an employer has a \u2018substantial illegal purpose\u2019 without that determination being based on an actual court finding.\u2019 \u2013 Megan Walter. \u2018The government can and will collect defaulted federal student loan debt by withholding money from borrowers, tax refunds, federal pensions and even their wages,\u2019 \u2013 Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary.\n\nThe article presents the facts and statements from involved parties without editorializing, offering a clear, evidence\u2011based overview of the legal dispute and its potential impact on student\u2011loan borrowers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/student-loan-update-trump-admin-faces-new-lawsuit-over-forgiveness-10790279)\n\n**EEOC to Close All Pending Disparate Impact Investigations by September 30, 2025**\nOn September 27, 2025 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced it will administratively close all pending charges that rely solely on disparate impact by the end of September 2025. The decision follows President Trump\u2019s April\u202f23,\u202f2025 executive order, 'Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy', which directed federal agencies to eliminate reliance on disparate impact liability. According to an internal agency memorandum, staff must close those cases by September\u202f30 and issue 'right to sue' letters by October\u202f31, giving charging parties 90\u202fdays to pursue litigation in federal court. The EEOC will no longer investigate or resolve charges based solely on disparate impact; ongoing matters that also allege intentional discrimination may proceed only on that theory. The agency has already withdrawn from several suits, and other federal agencies\u2014Department of Justice, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Federal Trade Commission\u2014must apply similar restrictions in fair housing, credit, and consumer protection. This change marks a significant shift, as disparate impact has been a cornerstone of systemic discrimination enforcement since the Supreme Court recognized it in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. and codified it into Title\u202fVII in 1991. While Title\u202fVII still prohibits disparate impact discrimination, workers will now need to seek private counsel and file lawsuits on their own, bearing the cost and complexity of proving the case.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 05:11 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/eeoc-to-close-all-pending-disparate-8881352/)\n\n**BREAKING: FTC Abandons Noncompete Rule, Announces Targeted Enforcement Actions Amidst FTC Staffing Shake-ups**\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on September\u202f5\u202f2025 that it will dismiss its appeals of district\u2011court decisions blocking its Non\u2011compete Rule, effectively abandoning the nationwide ban on non\u2011compete agreements.

The rule was challenged on three grounds: lack of statutory authority, unconstitutional delegation of power, and arbitrary and capriciousness. Courts were split: the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sided with the FTC, while the Northern District of Texas enjoined the rule. The FTC appealed to the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, but under new Chair Andrew\u202fFerguson\u2014appointed by President Trump on Inauguration Day\u202f2025\u2014the agency decided to withdraw its appeals and accept the vacatur. Ferguson said the FTC would shift from rulemaking to \u201caggressive enforcement,\u201d issuing enforcement actions and warning letters to employers.

The agency decided to walk away from the fight, leaving in place court rulings that vacated the rule, after weighing its options for more than six months following a change in presidential administrations. The abandoned rule, finalized in April 2024, would have banned nearly all post\u2011employment non\u2011compete agreements across the country and required employers to notify workers that their existing non\u2011competes were unenforceable, with only narrow exceptions for senior executives and business sales. At the time the FTC estimated that roughly 30\u202fmillion workers\u2014about one in five\u2014were bound by non\u2011competes. Legal challenges came fast: a Texas federal court struck down the ban nationwide in August 2024, finding the agency lacked statutory authority, and a Florida court issued a narrower injunction soon after. The FTC initially appealed both decisions but changed its posture after the administration shift, ultimately concluding that continuing the appeals was not the right move. The agency is not abandoning non\u2011compete enforcement altogether; it plans to use its adjudicatory powers to target what it calls \"onerous\" or \"unfair\" non\u2011compete agreements on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis, especially in sectors such as healthcare and staffing. Recent enforcement actions and warning letters underscore that message. The era of a blanket ban may be over, but employers should expect continued scrutiny\u2014and a more surgical approach\u2014from the FTC going forward.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 10:19 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ftc-walks-away-from-noncompete-ban-9360267/)\n\n**The FTC's Employee Noncompete Rule is Officially Dead, but Substantial Barriers to Noncompetes Remain in Effect**\nIn May\u202f2024 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a final rule that would have banned almost all non\u2011compete agreements nationwide, classifying them as an unfair method of competition under Section\u202f5 of the FTC Act. The rule would have prohibited new non\u2011competes for all workers, including senior executives, and would have invalidated existing non\u2011compete clauses for workers other than senior executives from September\u202f2024 onward, while allowing senior\u2011executive clauses to remain in force. The rule contained only narrow exceptions, such as agreements tied to a bona fide sale of a business.\n\nTwo developments halted the rule. First, litigation challenged the rule\u2019s substance and the FTC\u2019s authority, resulting in injunctions against the rule. Second, the new Trump administration signaled it would review the rule and pursue appellate review of court rulings that struck it down.\n\nOn September\u202f5\u202f2025 the FTC withdrew its pending appeals, effectively ending the national policy. The FTC Chairman, however, stated the agency would \"continue to enforce the antitrust laws aggressively against non\u2011compete agreements,\" but on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis. Employers must still navigate a patchwork of state and local laws that regulate non\u2011compete enforceability.\n\nUnder federal law, non\u2011compete agreements will be evaluated under the \"rule of reason,\" balancing a legitimate pro\u2011competitive purpose against potential anti\u2011competitive effects. The FTC and the Department of Justice will scrutinize whether the restraint is reasonably necessary and whether less restrictive alternatives exist.\n\nFollowing the rule\u2019s abandonment, FTC Chairman Ferguson issued warning letters to large healthcare and staffing companies, saying \"many healthcare employers and staffing companies include noncompete[s]\u2026 in employment contracts that may unreasonably limit employment options for\u2026 nurses, physicians, and other medical professionals\" and urged a thorough review of agreements. The FTC also noted that \"narrowly tailored noncompetes\" may serve valid purposes, but many are overbroad in duration, geographic scope, or inappropriate for certain roles.\n\nEmployers no longer face an absolute federal ban, but the FTC signals a high bar for proving a non\u2011compete is reasonable. Four states\u2014California, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Oklahoma\u2014have near\u2011total bans, and many others impose significant restrictions. Employers are advised to seek legal counsel on both state and federal law before drafting or renewing non\u2011compete agreements and to consider less risky means of protecting business interests.\n\nKey dates and facts: May\u202f2024 rule issuance; September\u202f2024 effective date for worker non\u2011competes; September\u202f5\u202f2025 FTC withdrawal; four states with near\u2011total bans; FTC\u2019s \"rule of reason\" approach.\n\nQuotes: \"continue to enforce the antitrust laws aggressively against noncompete agreements\"; \"many healthcare employers and staffing companies include noncompete[s]\u2026 in employment contracts that may unreasonably limit employment options for\u2026 nurses, physicians, and other medical professionals\"; \"narrowly tailored noncompetes\" may serve valid purposes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-ftc-s-employee-noncompete-rule-is-7249961/)\n\n**https://natlawreview.com/article/five-takeaways-ftcs-decision-abandon-noncompete-rule**\nOn September\u202f5\u202f2025 the FTC announced it would accept the Texas court\u2019s vacatur of its 2024 Non\u2011compete Rule, ending the agency\u2019s attempt to ban most employee non\u2011compete agreements. The rule had been struck down in August\u202f2024 and the FTC had appealed, but the change in administration led to the decision to 'accede to the vacatur.' The ruling means the rule cannot take effect or be enforced. The FTC, however, said it will continue to target over\u2011broad non\u2011competes. A week before the announcement it issued a consent order against the nation\u2019s largest pet\u2011cremation company, requiring it to abandon non\u2011competes for all hires outside California except key employees. On September\u202f10 it sent warning letters to several large healthcare employers and staffing firms, urging them to review and, if necessary, 'discontinue' restrictive covenants. The agency also requested information on non\u2011compete use to inform future enforcement. The article notes that the FTC\u2019s authority to adopt substantive rules was limited by a 1973 D.C. Circuit decision, and a 2025 Texas district court held the FTC lacks such authority for labor practices. The FTC will focus on cases involving low\u2011wage, unskilled workers, broad geographic or temporal scopes, and agreements that violate state law. Nine states\u2014including Arkansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Texas, Indiana, Wyoming, and Virginia\u2014have recently tightened or limited non\u2011compete enforceability, while Florida has strengthened it.

On September 5, 2025, the FTC announced that it would no longer pursue enforcement of the rule that had been adopted during the Biden administration, which aimed to prohibit the majority of non\u2011compete clauses in employer\u2011worker agreements. The rule had attracted over 26,000 public comments and was challenged in three lawsuits\u2014first in Pennsylvania, then Texas, and finally Florida. The courts in Texas and Florida ruled against the FTC, with the Northern District of Texas blocking the rule from taking effect on August 20, 2024. The Trump administration reversed the FTC\u2019s course, and new Chair Andrew Ferguson stated that the agency would instead address unlawful non\u2011compete agreements through enforcement actions rather than formal rulemaking. The FTC has already launched an enforcement action against Gateway Services, Inc. and issued a request for information to better understand the scope and effects of non\u2011compete agreements. The voluntary dismissal of the appeals marks the end of the debate over the Final Rule, ensuring it will never go into effect.

The Texas court vacated the rule entirely, citing an overreach of FTC authority, while the Florida court issued a narrower, plaintiff\u2011specific injunction under the major\u2011questions doctrine. Following the appointment of Chair Andrew N. Ferguson, the FTC voluntarily dismissed both appeals, effectively ending the rule it had announced just over a year ago. \n\nDespite dropping the blanket ban, the FTC remains active on non\u2011compete enforcement. On September 4, 2025, it filed an action against Gateway Services, Inc., alleging that the company\u2019s widespread use of one\u2011year non\u2011compete agreements violated Section\u202f5 of the FTC Act. The proposed consent order would bar the firm from enforcing most of these agreements and impose long\u2011term compliance obligations, with limited exceptions for executives and business sales. \n\nThe agency\u2019s strategy has shifted from a universal prohibition to a case\u2011by\u2011case \u2018rule\u2011of\u2011reason\u2019 analysis of the most egregious non\u2011compete uses.

The court, led by Judge Ada E. Brown, found the FTC lacked authority to promulgate the rule, deeming it arbitrary and capricious and issuing a nationwide vacatur and injunction in August 2024. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson and Commissioner Melissa Holyoak said the agency 'lacked authority for a sweeping rule' but would continue to police illegal non\u2011competes through enforcement. The 2024 rule had aimed to ban almost all post\u2011employment non\u2011compete agreements, requiring employers to rescind clauses and notify workers, with narrow exceptions. With the rule vacated, the FTC is pivoting to targeted enforcement under Section\u202f5 of the FTC Act, focusing on cases where non\u2011compete clauses are coercive, exploitative, or harm competition. The agency has already filed a complaint against Gateway Services, alleging anticompetitive use of non\u2011competes that could affect about 1,800 employees, and proposed a consent order limiting such clauses. Future enforcement will target low\u2011 and middle\u2011wage workers, non\u2011compete restrictions on roles without competitively sensitive information, and market\u2011wide effects that suppress mobility and wages. The FTC also launched a public inquiry through its Joint Labor Task Force, inviting comments on non\u2011compete use, with submissions due by November\u202f3,\u202f2025. While the nationwide ban is gone, employers should expect continued scrutiny through complaints, consent orders, and litigation, and should review their policies to comply with federal and state laws, especially in states like California and Minnesota that have strict non\u2011compete bans.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/rule-abandoned-crackdown-continues-federal-trade-commissions-new-non-compete)\n\n**Trump's Federal Trade Commission Abandons Noncompete Ban**\nOn September 12 2025 the FTC voted 3\u20111 to dismiss its appeal of a district\u2011court ruling that barred the agency from enforcing a nationwide ban on non\u2011compete agreements. The ban, announced by the FTC in April 2024 after a proposed rule in January 2023, would have invalidated nearly all existing non\u2011competes and prohibited new ones except in rare circumstances. The rule was supported by Commissioners Lina M. Khan, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, and Alvaro M. Bedoya, and opposed by Andrew N. Ferguson and Melissa Holyoak. The ban never took effect because the U.S. Chamber of Commerce successfully challenged the FTC\u2019s authority in a May 9 2024 lawsuit (Ryan LLC v. FTC), and the Northern District of Texas granted summary judgment in favor of the Chamber. The Fifth Circuit later granted a 120\u2011day pause on the FTC\u2019s appeal, which was extended to September 8 2025. The FTC\u2019s new chair, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would focus on case\u2011by\u2011case enforcement rather than a broad ban, a shift that critics say will do little to protect the 30 million Americans subject to non\u2011compete agreements. The FTC also announced a 60\u2011day comment period on Regulations.gov to gather data on non\u2011compete prevalence. Lina M. Khan had said of the ban, 'Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including from the more than 8,500 new startups that would be created a year once noncompetes are banned...' The article argues that the FTC\u2019s ad\u2011hoc enforcement will impact fewer than 2,000 employees in a niche industry, and that the agency\u2019s reversal is a win for corporations and a loss for workers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/trumps-federal-trade-commission-abandons-noncompete-ban)\n\n**FTC Noncompete Ban Overturned: What It Means for Your Business - Law 4 Small Business (L4SB)**\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has withdrawn its appeal of a federal court ruling that blocked a proposed nationwide ban on non\u2011compete agreements, effectively ending the effort to invalidate most existing clauses. The FTC\u2019s April 2024 rule, which would have prohibited nearly all non\u2011compete clauses, was estimated to affect about one in five American workers\u2014roughly 30\u202fmillion people\u2014and was projected to boost worker wages by up to $300\u202fbillion annually. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Ryan LLC, sued, arguing the FTC overstepped its authority by pre\u2011empting state contract laws; a Texas judge agreed and issued a ruling that blocked the ban before it could take effect. In a joint statement, new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson and Commissioner Melissa Holyoak called the rule an \u201cextraordinary assertion of authority\u201d that unlawfully over\u2011rode state laws, noting it \u201cpreempted the laws of all fifty States, and actively displaced hundreds of existing laws across forty\u2011six States.\u201d With the appeal withdrawn, the Texas court\u2019s decision stands, leaving non\u2011compete enforcement to a patchwork of state laws. The FTC will now focus on challenging non\u2011compete agreements that it deems anticompetitive under existing statutes such as the Sherman Act. Chair Ferguson acknowledged that non\u2011compete clauses can be abused and \u201cseverely inhibit workers\u2019 ability to make a living.\u201d The agency\u2019s recent order to a large pet cremation company to stop enforcing non\u2011competes with nearly 1,800 employees illustrates this targeted approach. For small businesses, the reversal means they can continue to use non\u2011compete agreements, provided they comply with state\u2011specific laws, and must work closely with counsel to draft enforceable contracts. The change also restores the status quo of state\u2011by\u2011state regulation, creating complexity for employers and affecting talent mobility in regions where non\u2011competes are common.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 04:45 PM\nSource:[Law 4 Small Business](https://www.l4sb.com/blog/ftc-noncompete-ban-overturned-what-it-means-for-your-business/)\n\n**Under Trump, the Federal Trade Commission is abandoning its ban on noncompetes**\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has voted 3\u20111 to dismiss the appeal of a Texas federal judge that halted its 2024 rule banning non\u2011compete agreements, effectively moving to vacate the ban that had been championed by former chair Lina Khan. The ban, which never took effect, was challenged by the Dallas\u2011based tax\u2011services firm Ryan LLC, which argued that the FTC had exceeded its authority. A 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in September 2024 halted the ban nationwide, and the Biden administration appealed. In March 2025 the Trump administration asked the court for a 120\u2011day pause on the appeal, citing the change in administration and comments from new FTC chair Andrew Ferguson that the agency should reconsider the rule. The court granted a 60\u2011day pause in July, ending on September 8. Just before that deadline, the FTC announced it had voted 3\u20111 to dismiss the appeal and take steps to vacate the rule. The dissenting vote was cast by Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who returned to the commission after a court ruling. The FTC estimates that roughly 30\u202fmillion people\u2014about 1 in 5 American workers\u2014are bound by non\u2011compete agreements, and that the rule would have prevented the creation of 8,500 new businesses and the loss of nearly $300\u202fbillion in wages annually. The FTC received 26,000 public comments on the rule, almost all supporting a nationwide ban. Andrew Ferguson, who has said non\u2011compete agreements can be \u2018pernicious\u2019 and that he prefers enforcement of the Sherman Act against non\u2011compete and no\u2011poach agreements, told Fox Business that his priority is to target violations rather than impose a blanket ban. Rebecca Slaughter argues that enforcement alone does not protect workers such as hair\u2011salon employees or fast\u2011food workers. Elizabeth Wilkins, former chief of staff to Khan and architect of the rule, warns that the FTC\u2019s enforcement strategy will be insufficient, citing the agency\u2019s limited staff of about 1,400 employees. The article also recounts the experience of Rebecca Denton, a real\u2011estate transaction coordinator in Colorado, who was trapped by a non\u2011compete when she wanted to leave her job during the pandemic surge. She ultimately quit and took lower\u2011paying gig work, citing the lack of a protective law until Colorado passed a limiting statute in 2022. The piece concludes that a clear, simple ban on non\u2011competes is the only way to truly protect workers, according to Wilkins.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 09:46 PM\nSource:[wlrh.org](https://www.wlrh.org/npr-news/2025-09-05/under-trump-the-federal-trade-commission-is-abandoning-its-ban-on-noncompetes)\n\n**Trump FTC Moves to Stop Defending Worker Noncompete Rule**\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced it will no longer pursue appeals of court rulings that blocked a near\u2011total ban on worker non\u2011compete agreements, effectively ending the Biden administration\u2019s effort to invalidate the rule. The FTC voluntarily dismissed cases in two separate appeals courts, reversing the litigation stance of its Democratic predecessor. The rule, adopted in 2024, would have barred the use of most non\u2011compete contracts, which affect roughly one in five U.S. workers, according to agency estimates. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, a Republican at the time of the vote, dissented, arguing the regulation exceeded the FTC\u2019s rule\u2011making authority. The rule was vacated by Judge Ada Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in August after a lawsuit by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Ryan LLC, which echoed Ferguson\u2019s arguments. The Supreme Court\u2019s June decision curtailed judges\u2019 power to make such rulings under the \u2018major questions\u2019 doctrine. The FTC had appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit. Former FTC Chair Lina Khan defended the ban, noting the agency received more than 25,000 public comments supporting it and stating, 'a basic reality: robbing people of their economic liberty also robs them of all sorts of other freedoms, chilling speech, infringing on religious practice, and impeding people\u2019s right to organize.' The FTC\u2019s move follows a July 8 decision by the Eighth Circuit that vacated a rule requiring businesses to simplify cancellation of recurring memberships, another blow to regulatory efforts pursued during Khan\u2019s tenure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[news.bloomberglaw.com](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/white-collar-and-criminal-law/trump-ftc-moves-to-stop-defending-worker-noncompete-rule)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts\u2014drawing from regulatory affairs, labor law, administrative/constitutional law, political science, economics, and government relations\u2014strongly agree there is virtually no chance that the FTC's proposed ban on non-compete agreements for most workers will be enacted in more or less its current form before January 1, 2026. Key consistent points in their reasoning include: \n\n- The FTC's rule was decisively vacated by a federal court on statutory authority and 'major questions doctrine' grounds, rendering swift legal reversal highly improbable.\n- The FTC, under new Trump-era leadership, has not only accepted the court's decision but has also officially abandoned both its appeals and the broad rulemaking approach, now favoring case-by-case enforcement.\n- There is no indication of imminent action by Congress to explicitly authorize such a ban, and all regulatory and political momentum has evaporated after the leadership transition.\n- Once a rule is vacated and the agency has voluntarily withdrawn appeals, the historical (base rate) likelihood of a revived, nearly identical rule returning in such a short time frame (2.5 months) is vanishingly small.\n- The only hypothetical 'yes' scenarios (e.g., emergency reversal, unprecedented legal/legislative action) are universally considered practically impossible given the political, legal, and bureaucratic situation.\n\nFinal probabilities given by experts almost all round to 0%, with slight 1% allowances in a few cases for extreme tail risks, but all affirm a de facto impossibility under the criteria. The collective assessment is firm: the FTC's nationwide non-compete ban for most workers will not be enacted before 2026, and the thrust of policy remains with state-level law and narrowly tailored FTC enforcement actions.",
