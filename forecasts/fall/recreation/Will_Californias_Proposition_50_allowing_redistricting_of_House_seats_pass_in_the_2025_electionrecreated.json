The proposition, slated for the November 4, 2025 special election ballot, could give Democrats up to five additional U.S. House seats. Dr. Catherine Dillon, the organizer, said attendees were there to counter the gerrymandering that occurred in Texas, where legislators \u2018just grabbed 5 more Republican seats without having input from the people of Texas.\u2019 She added that if the proposal passed, it would affect the Coachella Valley, noting that \u2018District 41 gets split up quite a bit.\u2019 Brandon Riker, a congressional candidate who may represent District 41 or 48 depending on the outcome, praised the grassroots support, saying \u2018We just see it, the grassroots rising up all across the state in support of this.\u2019 Christine Massey expressed frustration with long\u2011time representative Ken Calvert, stating \u2018Ken Calvert\u2019s constituents here in CA\u201141 have spent the last year trying to get in touch with him\u2026 We\u2019ve been ignored.

Who is he?**\nCalifornia\u2019s upcoming special election on Nov.\u202f4 will decide Proposition\u202f50, which would allow lawmakers to redraw congressional districts every two years in 2026, 2028, and 2030. Conservative donors have challenged the measure, arguing it would disproportionately affect GOP seats. The most recent contribution came from Charles T.\u202fMunger\u202fJr., who gave $10\u202fmillion to the 'No on Prop.\u202f50 \u2013 Protect Voters First' campaign, according to the Los\u202fAngeles\u202fTimes. Munger\u202fJr. is the son of Charles\u202fT.\u202fMunger\u202fSr., a Berkshire Hathaway vice\u2011chair and philanthropist who donated more than $500\u202fmillion to universities, including a $100\u202fmillion gift that funded Munger Hall at UC\u202fSanta\u202fBarbara. Munger\u202fJr., a physicist from Palo\u202fAlto, has supported GOP campaigns and cited his backing of the 2008 Voters First Act\u2014establishing the California Citizens Redistricting Commission\u2014as a reason for opposing Prop\u202f50. He published an opinion piece in the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes on Sept.\u202f2 calling the proposal gerrymandering. The commission, composed of five Democrats, five Republicans and four independents, redraws congressional, state senate, state assembly and State Board of Equalization districts after each decennial census. The article lists several congressional seats that could be affected, such as Rep.\u202fDoug\u202fLaMalfa\u2019s 1st District, Rep.\u202fKevin\u202fKiley\u2019s 3rd, Rep.\u202fDavid\u202fValadao\u2019s 22nd, Rep.\u202fKen\u202fCalvert\u2019s 41st and Rep.\u202fDarrell\u202fIssa\u2019s 48th, noting shifts that could move them from Republican\u2011leaning to Democratic\u2011leaning territories.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 12:09 AM\nSource:[Redding Record Searchlight](https://www.redding.com/story/news/nation/california/2025/09/19/who-is-charles-munger-jr-the-megadonor-fighting-redistricting/86248482007/)\n\n**Why Newsom's push for new House maps isn't a sure thing, even in...**\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing a constitutional amendment (Proposition\u202f50) that would temporarily redraw U.S. House districts to add five Democratic seats for the 2026 mid\u2011term elections. The measure, which has the support of the state\u2019s Democratic legislature, faces uncertainty because voters may be confused or opposed to change.  \n\n- Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in California by nearly 2\u2011to\u20111, yet the amendment could still be close, as the current U.S. House composition is 219 Republican seats, 213 Democratic seats, with three vacancies.\n- Newsom warned in an email that the election would not be easy, saying, \u2018I wish I could tell you this election was going to be easy, but it won\u00b4t.\u2019\n- Opponents argue the proposal would split racial and ethnic communities and overturn the independent commission that voters approved more than a decade ago.  Rep. Kevin\u202fKiley said, \u2018The people put the (independent) commission in place.

Schwarzenegger told a crowd at the University of Southern California that \"They are trying to fight for democracy by getting rid of the democratic principles of California,\" and said that rejecting Proposition\u202f50 was \"a no\u2011brainer\" because the map\u2011drawing process lacked transparency. The piece notes that Republicans currently hold a 219\u2011212 edge in the U.S. House, with four vacancies, and that a Democratic flip could block President Trump\u2019s agenda. It also quotes Lance Christensen of the California Policy Center, who says Schwarzenegger\u2019s legacy policy and his criticism of Trump make him a powerful spokesman for voters opposed to the measure. Matt Klink, president of Klink Campaigns, Inc., adds that Schwarzenegger\u2019s endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris gives him credibility among California voters. The article mentions that Schwarzenegger has not recorded campaign ads or raised money for the opposition, but his team allowed a committee to film his USC appearance. Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for an opposition campaign funded by Republican donor Charles\u202fMunger\u202fJr., says Schwarzenegger\u2019s appeal transcends politics.

Newsom signed legislation that would give Democrats five additional seats, while Republicans in Texas are seeking a similar gain.

The plan, to be voted on in a special election on November 4, aims to flip five Republican\u2011held seats and strengthen four competitive ones, mirroring Texas Republicans\u2019 mid\u2011decade redistricting that could add five GOP seats in Texas. Newsom framed the move as a \u2018neutralization\u2019 of Texas\u2019s gerrymander, saying, 'We\u2019re responding to what occurred in Texas. We\u2019re neutralizing what occurred, and we\u2019re giving the American people a fair chance.' The proposal, dubbed Proposition\u202f50, would merge conservative Shasta County with liberal Marin County and other district mergers, shifting the balance toward Democrats. California currently sends 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans to Congress out of 52 seats, while statewide voter registration is about 38% Republican. A Los Angeles Times/Berkeley poll shows 75% of California voters approve of Newsom\u2019s handling of the issue, compared with his overall 38% approval rating. Former President Barack Obama endorsed the plan, calling it \u2018a smart, measured approach\u2019 to a \u2018particular problem.\u2019 Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher criticized the plan as a power grab, saying, 'It\u2019s about power on both sides, rigging congressional districts to get partisan results. That\u2019s what a gerrymander is.' The measure could cost up to $200\u202fmillion and faces legal challenges from Republicans, former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and philanthropist Charles Munger Jr. Nationally, a Politico/Morning Consult poll shows Democrats overwhelmingly back California\u2019s effort, while conservatives accuse Newsom of hypocrisy. If passed, the maps could keep the House split 50\u201150 in 2026, but deepen polarization and may trigger similar mid\u2011decade redistricting in other states.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 10:21 PM\nSource:[FrankNez Media](https://franknez.com/gavin-newsom-now-counters-texas-republicans-with-redistricting-plan/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=gavin-newsom-now-counters-texas-republicans-with-redistricting-plan)\n\n**The fight over California redistricting enters new phase**\nCalifornia Democrats appear to have secured a new congressional map through the state legislature, but the battle over the map\u2014known as Proposition\u202f50\u2014has only just begun. With 74 days until the November vote, Gov. Gavin Newsom and allies must persuade voters to approve an extraordinary mid\u2011decade redrawing that could give Democrats five additional House seats, countering Republican gains in Texas. Opponents\u2014an unlikely coalition of Republican leaders, good\u2011government advocates and former GOP governor Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2014are preparing a heavy advertising push. Amy Thoma Tan, spokeswoman for Protect Voters First, said, 'It's really a September campaign,' and noted that the group will be financially backed by Charles Munger Jr. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy confirmed he will help raise money for the opposition group Stop Sacramento's Power Grab. The campaign is expected to exceed nine figures in spending. Newsom\u2019s operation has already raised $6.2\u202fmillion in seven days from more than 200,000 donors. Voter turnout is uncertain; a 2016 recall of Newsom saw 58% participation. Jessica Millan Patterson, former chair of the California Republican Party, warned, 'It's going to be an expensive ballot initiative,' and emphasized the stakes for 2026 races. The measure is framed as a check on President Trump\u2019s influence, with Hannah Milgrom of Yes on\u202f50 calling it 'the country's best hope to counter Trump's Texas power grab.' A May poll found only one in three Californians approved of Trump\u2019s job performance. Newsom\u2019s approval stands at 46% overall and 36% among independents, according to the Institute\u2019s poll. Republicans are also monitoring former governor Schwarzenegger\u2019s stance, while Democrats look to former President Barack Obama for support. The campaign\u2019s outcome will determine whether Democrats can offset Republican gains in the House for the remainder of Trump\u2019s second term.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[KESQ.com](https://kesq.com/news/national-politics/cnn-us-politics/2025/08/22/the-fight-over-california-redistricting-enters-new-phase/)\n\n**California Democrats plow ahead in redistricting fight**\nCalifornia Democrats are poised to vote Thursday on a bill that would trigger a statewide special election to redraw the state's congressional map, aiming to secure five additional House seats in the 2026 midterms. The California Supreme Court rejected a petition by Republican legislators to halt Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D) mid\u2011decade redistricting plan. Newsom framed the effort as a response to Texas's GOP\u2011friendly redistricting, which Texas Republicans hope will net them five extra House seats. Newsom said, 'We're fighting fire with fire, and we're gonna punch these sons of b\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011es in the mouth,' on 'The Siren Podcast.' Texas lawmakers advanced a new map after a two\u2011week delay; the Texas Senate is expected to sign it, with Gov. Greg Abbott (R) slated to approve. Trump posted on Truth Social, 'Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.' California's independent commission would normally set the maps, but the proposed bill would let voters approve or reject the new map in a November special election. Early polls show most Californians oppose mid\u2011decade redistricting, though Newsom's pollster reports widespread support. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and Speaker Mike Johnson (R\u2011La.) have pledged to fight the push. A Reuters survey found most voters believe partisan redistricting threatens democracy, and the Kansas City Star reports Missouri Republicans are considering a gerrymander, following other states such as Florida, Indiana, Illinois and New York.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 07:50 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/newsletters/evening-report/5464311-california-dems-texas-gop-redistricting-jd-vance-georgia-map-ukraine-zelensky-russia-dc-patrol-newsom-lisa-cook/)\n\n**California lawmakers approve Democratic gerrymandering plan**\nCalifornia lawmakers approved a bill that would place a measure on the November\u202f2025 ballot to temporarily replace the state\u2019s U.S. House districts with new maps drawn by Democratic members of Congress, according to the article. The new maps would flip five seats currently held by Republicans, a figure cited in the report. The legislation, dubbed the Election\u202fRigging\u202fResponse\u202fAct, was signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and was passed by the legislature after the California Supreme Court dismissed a Republican challenge. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said, 'Today we give every Californian the power to say 'No''. Senate President Mike McGuire said, 'We're here today for one reason: the nefarious actions of the Republican leadership in Texas.' The bill follows Texas Republicans\u2019 plan to redraw districts to give Trump\u2019s party five seats, a move that the article notes was announced by Trump on Truth\u202fSocial. The article notes that the new maps would add Democratic voters to battleground districts in the San\u202fJoaquin\u202fValley and southern California, including Rep. David Valadao\u2019s district, and would protect competitive seats held by Democrats such as Rep. Adam Gray. The maps do not significantly change Bay\u202fArea lines, which are all Democratic. Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers and approved the bill despite Republican opposition. The article cites that former President Barack Obama supported the redistricting, while former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger opposed it. Mailers urging voters to reject the measure were already circulating, funded by a committee backed by Republican megadonor Charles\u202fMunger. The article also reports that Newsom has raised more than $6\u202fmillion for the campaign, according to the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 03:32 PM\nSource:[San Jose Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/21/california-lawmakers-approve-democratic-gerrymandering-plan/)\n\n**Newsom has a plan to give Democrats a leg up for the midterms**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to hold a special election in the first week of November so voters can approve a new U.S. House district map that could give Democrats an advantage in the 2026 midterms. Newsom said he would temporarily suspend the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission and present an alternative map directly to voters, arguing that the current process could be used by Republicans to \u2018rig the game\u2019. He highlighted that California currently has 52 state House seats, of which Democrats hold 43, and that the proposed special election could cost more than $200\u202fmillion. The Legislature is on summer recess until Aug.\u202f18, and the Democratic caucuses in the Senate and Assembly are preparing a two\u2011thirds majority ballot measure to move the plan forward. The governor emphasized transparency, saying, 'We will go to the people of this state in a transparent way and ask them to consider the new circumstances\u2026 It\u2019s going to be given to the voters for their consideration in a very transparent way so they know exactly what they\u2019re doing.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 12:04 AM\nSource:[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/california-redistricting-november-ballot/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether California's Proposition 50 (allowing redistricting of House seats) will pass in the 2025 election are split but generally see the outcome as highly uncertain, with a modest lean against passage. Experts unanimously highlight several cross-cutting themes: \n\nPolling and Undecideds: Recent reputable polls (Emerson: 51-34 Yes; UC Berkeley: 48-32 Yes) show a Yes lead but with support below the 60% threshold usually considered safe for California ballot measures, and a notable undecided bloc (15%+). Most experts note that in California, undecided voters tend to break No, especially on complex or process-related measures, and ballot measures polling below 60% often fail as Election Day nears and well-funded opposition campaigns ramp up negative messaging.\n\nPartisan Context: California\u2019s deep-blue, Democratic-leaning electorate and nationalization of the contest (as a response to Texas\u2019s Republican gerrymander and Trump\u2019s influence) are cited as the main reasons Prop 50 could pass. Several analysts predict robust Democratic turnout, fueled by mobilization from the DNC, Governor Newsom, and endorsements from figures like Obama, countering some historical base rate headwinds. However, most caution that party identification alone may not be enough to overcome process skepticism and status quo bias among independents and moderate Democrats.\n\nOpposition Strength and Process Legitimacy: The opposition features high-profile, bipartisan, and respected leadership (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charles Munger Jr., League of Women Voters) and is extremely well-funded. The No campaign's ability to frame Prop 50 as a power grab that undermines California\u2019s popular independent redistricting commission resonates with good-government, reform-oriented, and moderate voters. This message, combined with institutional path dependence and anti-gerrymandering norms, is widely expected to cause late breaks toward No.\n\nBallot Context and Turnout: The special, single-issue election heightens turnout uncertainty. While Democratic mobilization is unusually intense, low overall turnout\u2014composed disproportionately of high-propensity voters, older voters, and political independents\u2014may favor the opposition and status quo bias. Experts highlight that turnout dynamics are crucial and if the Yes campaign succeeds in nationalizing the contest, victory is plausible but not assured.\n\nProbability Estimates: Final probabilities given for Prop 50's passage range from a low of 38% (Sociology/SocialMovementTheory) to a high of 65% (PoliticalPolling/VoterIntentionSurveying, CampaignStrategy/VoterMobilization, Public Administration/StakeholderTheory). The modal forecast is just below 50%; most cluster in the 42\u201358% range, generally shading against passage. Those assigning above-even odds do so based on the scale of Democratic mobilization and the unique national salience of the contest, but all warn of late erosion in Yes support.\n\nConclusion: Experts expect a near-toss-up with a modest tilt toward No. The pro-Prop 50 campaign\u2019s partisan intensity, framing, and mobilization effort keep passage possible (and some experts see Yes as a modest favorite), but the history of process measures in California\u2014especially with credible, bipartisan opposition and a large undecided electorate\u2014suggests late movement toward defeat is likely. The consensus expectation is that while Prop 50 can pass if Democratic turnout is especially strong and the national narrative overwhelms process concerns, the late-breaking dynamics and institutional skepticism pose significant hurdles to passage.",
