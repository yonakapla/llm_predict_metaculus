However, some critiques\u2014especially those directed at complacency regarding the LDI\u2014are compelling. The consensus among experts from comparative politics, Middle East studies, and democracy assessment is that while status quo resilience is meaningful, the current convergence of internal and external stressors is historically exceptional for Israel. The possibility of a negative feedback loop between economic decline and democratic erosion is real and somewhat underappreciated. Still, no one credibly argued for a much lower probability; indeed, the range of 70-78% was broadly defended. Given this, and recognizing that my initial probability was already at the lower end of consensus to reflect compounding tail risks, I see no strong case for a major revision. However, I will make a modest downward adjustment to 69% to reflect the polemics around faster-than-expected LDI decline if multiple shocks coincide.",

Second, several forecasters emphasized the historical speed with which LDI can fall below critical thresholds once elite consensus on liberal norms breaks, especially in a context of existential security crisis and economic contraction. While none argued that full collapse is likely, the consensus is that the risk of falling below the LDI threshold is higher than typical OECD or developed country base rates, and that economic risks to HDI, while still modest, are not negligible if sanctions bite harder or conflict escalates. The result is a scenario with higher tail risk than I previously weighted. Given this, I am lowering my probability to 65%.

Several forecasters rightfully challenge status quo bias and the overreliance on base rates, emphasizing that Israel\u2019s situation is not comparable to the average OECD peer due to its uniquely acute mix of stressors. The critique of the knowledge economy\u2019s resilience rings true: if the legitimacy crisis deepens and capital/talent flight accelerates, HDI risk is not negligible. However, the overall scenario analysis remains clear: a 'No' outcome is a real and rising risk, but not yet the most likely scenario.

This is especially pertinent given that the knowledge economy depends on openness, rule of law, and international connectivity\u2014precisely the domains at risk. While my original probability already accounted for elevated risk, the group discussion justifies nudging it slightly lower to reflect the increased plausibility of a 'No' scenario driven by mutually reinforcing political and economic shocks.

Critiques of more optimistic forecasters (e.g., World Bank and knowledge economy approaches) reinforced my view that generic OECD base rates may understate Israel\u2019s vulnerabilities, especially the potential for compounding, nonlinear decline. However, no new arguments or evidence emerged that would justify a substantial downward revision: the consensus is that status quo resilience is still likely to prevail, but the tail risk is real and higher than for most peers.

        "description": "This question assesses Israel's status as a developed, liberal democracy through two key lenses: human development and the health of its democratic institutions.\n\n\u2022\tHuman Development Index (HDI): This UN index is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: health, education, and standards of living. The HDI combines statistics on life expectancy, mean and expected years of schooling, and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita to rank countries into four tiers of human development. As of the 2023/2024 report, Israel's HDI score is 0.919, placing it firmly in the \u2018very high human development\u2019 category.\n\n\u2022\tLiberal Democracy Index (LDI): This V-Dem Institute index measures the quality of a country\u2019s democratic institutions. For the 2024 data year, Israel's LDI score is 0.62, ranking 45 of 179. The LDI is constructed by combining two major indices: the Electoral Democracy Index (measuring free elections, and freedoms of expression and association) and the Liberal Component Index (measuring checks on the executive and protections for individual liberties).\n\nIsrael's resilience is anchored in a world-leading innovation ecosystem, a highly educated workforce, and strong state institutions. However, recent events have tested this foundation. The contentious judicial reform proposals of 2023 triggered mass protests and deep societal divisions. The conflict that began in late 2023, in turn, triggered an economic contraction and led to Israel's first-ever sovereign credit rating downgrade in 2024. In education, recent PISA results revealed some of the largest performance gaps among OECD countries between different school systems and average performance lower than the OECD average. This question asks whether Israeli society will successfully navigate these heightened challenges to meet the criteria for a highly developed, liberal democratic nation, defined by clear HDI and LDI thresholds.",

described the Israeli attacks as 'genocidio', which have already killed more than 65,200 Palestinians, including over 19,000 children.\n\u2022 Of the nearly 200 UN member states, 139 officially recognize Palestine.\n\u2022 In Latin America, only Panama has not recognized the Palestinian state; it voted against Palestine\u2019s admission as a non\u2011member observer state in 2012.\n\u2022 Panama was one of the first Latin American countries to recognize Israel\u2019s independence in 1948 and support its UN admission in 1949.\n\u2022 Other Latin American countries that have recognized Palestine include Cuba and Nicaragua.\n\u2022 The United States, the only permanent member of the Security Council that has not recognized Palestine, is also among those that have not done so.\n\u2022

surveys by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) and Pew Research Center, Israeli public opinion on the Gaza war has shifted since the October\u202f7,\u202f2023 Hamas attack.\n\u2022 In mid\u2011October 2023 only 17\u202f% of Israelis believed the Netanyahu government should negotiate a hostage release, but by the first anniversary that figure rose to 53\u202f%, and by mid\u2011July\u202f2024 74\u202f% supported a cease\u2011fire to free all hostages and end fighting.\n\u2022 The same surveys show that 79\u202f% of Jewish Israelis reported little concern for Palestinian suffering, while 86\u202f% of Arab Israelis expressed moderate to high concern.\n\u2022 Only 6\u202f% of respondents said the war should end because of the human cost or desire for peace.\n\u2022 Pew\u2019s latest data indicate 39\u202f% think Israel\u2019s military response is correct, 34\u202f% think it is insufficient, and 19\u202f% think it is excessive; 27\u202f% believe Israel will eventually achieve its objectives, 40\u202f% are certain it will.\n\u2022 Seventy\u2011one percent are extremely or very worried that the war could spread to other countries, and 68\u202f% fear a prolonged Gaza conflict.\n\u2022 Regarding Gaza\u2019s future, 40\u202f% of Israelis think Israel should govern the Strip, 14\u202f% want Gazans to decide, and 6\u202f% support a Palestinian unity government.\n\u2022 The article also reports that 82\u202f% of Jewish Israelis imagine a total expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza as a solution, and only 0.09\u202f% of the population has signed a petition for full Palestinian state recognition.\n\u2022 Despite these views, a March\u202f2024 poll found that 62\u202f% of Israelis believe the current government lacks majority confidence, while 27\u202f% think it still has it.\n\u2022 The article quotes scholars such as Tamir\u202fSorek, who says \u2018the attitudes that were once marginal are now mainstream,\u2019 and

Israel is increasingly isolated worldwide as the Gaza war escalates, with backlash spilling into economic, cultural and sporting arenas.\n\u2022 The European Union has proposed sanctions that could partially suspend its free\u2011trade agreement with Israel, and several Western states have already imposed targeted sanctions on Israeli individuals, settler outposts and organisations linked to violence in the occupied West Bank.\n\u2022 Norway\u2019s sovereign\u2011wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, announced it would divest parts of its Israeli holdings, and France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom have imposed or threatened arms embargoes over Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza.\n\u2022 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a \u201ckind of isolation\u201d that could last for years, saying Israel must develop its weapons industry and adapt its economy to reduce reliance on external trade, though he later downplayed the remarks.\n\u2022 In the cultural sphere, broadcasters in Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain have threatened to boycott the Eurovision Song Contest if Israel participates in 2026, while the Irish national broadcaster RTE said it \u201cfeels that Ireland\u2019s participation would be unconscionable given the ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza.\u201d  The Belgian music festival in Ghent cancelled a concert by the Munich Philharmonic\u2019s Israeli conductor Lahav Shani, citing uncertainty about his stance on the \u201cgenocidal regime in Tel Aviv.\u201d  Hollywood actors and filmmakers, including Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield and Hannah Einbinder, pledged not to work with Israeli film institutions implicated in genocide and apartheid.\n\u2022 In sports, a major bike race stage was cancelled after pro\u2011Palestinian protests, a chess tournament in Spain barred Israeli players from competing under their national flag, and UEFA faced criticism after a banner reading \u201cStop killing children, Stop killing civilians\u201d was displayed at a Super Cup final.\n\u2022 The United Nations General Assembly saw several Western countries formally recognise a Palestinian state, and a UN commission report on genocide in Gaza has renewed focus on an ICC investigation.\n\u2022 Despite these pressures, the United States remains a steadfast ally, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio

internal and external crisis that could shape the country for a generation.\n\u2022 Internationally, 150 countries have recognised a Palestinian state, and Israel is experiencing economic, cultural and sporting boycotts.\n\u2022 Domestically, public trust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen to 40% according to an Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI) poll, despite broad support for the 12\u2011day Israel\u2011Iran war.\n\u2022 The IDI also found that two\u2011thirds of Israelis would support a hostage\u2011release deal in exchange for an end to the war, while 49% backed the security cabinet\u2019s decision to expand the Gaza operation.\n\u2022 Support for the war has dropped from 40% in March 2024 to 28% today.\n\u2022 Tal Schneider, a Times of Israel correspondent, notes a consensus of 70\u201175% on prioritising hostages, but a shift toward ending the war first: \"At the beginning [of the war], people believed you needed to finish the job inside Gaza.\n\u2022 But now, for at least a year, all polls suggest you need to get the hostages out first.\" \n\nPew Research found only 21% of Israelis believe peaceful coexistence with a Palestinian state is possible, the lowest level since 2013.\n\u2022 A Palestinian survey in Gaza showed 59% still support Hamas\u2019s 7\u2011October attack, while 87% do not believe the atrocities captured on video.\n\u2022 Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, said the international recognition of a Palestinian state is a \"fruit of October 7\" and a symbol of Palestinian dignity.\n\u2022 Netanyahu has described acceptance of a Palestinian state as \"national suicide\" and has urged Israelis to endure the conflict, calling the country a \"Super Sparta\".\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 06:00\n\nSource:

wave of UN member states recognizing the State of Palestine\u2014now more than 82% of the 193 UN members\u2014serves not only symbolic diplomatic purposes but also strategic pressure on Israel.\n\u2022 It cites that the Security Council has blocked recognition six times, yet Spain and Ireland revived the effort in May\u202f2024, and three G\u20117 members\u2014Canada, France and the United Kingdom\u2014have joined.\n\u2022 The author calls the Israeli government a 'Gobierno criminal israel\u00ed' and claims that recognition, combined with international judicial actions against Netanyahu, EU sanctions, and civil mobilization such as protests during the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and Eurovision, can shift Israeli public opinion and ultimately lead to change.\n\u2022 The piece draws parallels with the South\u2011Africa apartheid boycott, noting that it took over three decades to dismantle the regime.\n\u2022 The column also references the historical example of Jamaica\u2019s 1959 export ban and South Africa\u2019s 1990 economic collapse, using these to illustrate how diplomatic, economic, social, cultural and sporting pressures can eventually force a regime to change.\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 03:00\n\nSource: EL PA\u00cdS\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Advocacy\nContinent: Middle East\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation

family\u2019s history and his views on the Israeli state.\n\u2022 He recounts that his mother, Efratia Margalit, was born in Tel Aviv in 1909, and his father, Munio Weinraub Gitai, was a Bauhaus student who fled Nazi Germany and settled in British Palestine.\n\u2022 Gitai explains that his parents were part of the early socialist\u2011Zionist movement that envisioned a modern, secular Jewish society, and he argues that the idea of Israel as a state predates the Holocaust, citing the early 19th\u2011century immigration wave.\n\u2022 He notes that the image of Jews shifted from merchants and intellectuals to soldiers and farmers after the rise of the labor movement and the 1970s decline of the Labor Party.\n\u2022 Gitai says the current regime is overly militaristic and that its attempts to \"destroy Gaza\" reflect a destructive strategy.\n\u2022 He warns that \"if the regime continues like this it could destroy the country,\" echoing his quote: 'Se il regime continuer\u00e0 cos\u00ec potrebbe distruggere Israele.' He also comments on the persecution of Israeli artists abroad, the boycott of artists who support oppression, and the difficulty of living in a country surrounded by hostility.\n\u2022 Key quotes: \n- 'Il problema di Israele \u00e8 l\u2019essere diventato troppo forte militarmente.'\n- 'Se il regime continuer\u00e0 cos\u00ec potrebbe distruggere Israele.'.\n\nPublished date: September 27 2025, 23:18\n\nSource: lastampa.it\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Narrative\nContinent: Middle East\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation key: [8]\nTitle: \u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0627\u062d \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0634\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u064a\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629\u061f.. \u062e\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0621: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0642\u0629 \u062d\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0628\u0648\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0623\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a \u0644\u062f\u0639\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0636\u0639\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0632\u0629\n\nKey Points: \n\u2022 The Palestinian cause has recently gained unprecedented international momentum, highlighted by the 80th UN General Assembly where 159 of 196 member states recognized the state of Palestine, while only about 10 countries, mainly Israel and the United States, opposed the resolution.\n\u2022 Experts say that the unprecedented Israeli war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank have awakened global political awareness and shifted public opinion toward supporting the oppressed in Gaza.\n\u2022 Dr.\n\u2022 Amin Al\u2011Mashaqaba, former Jordanian minister and political science professor, notes that the recognition of Palestine by 159 states is a key indicator of success, and points out that the isolation of Israel is evident in the withdrawal of most delegations from the UN General Assembly in protest of Israeli conduct.\n\u2022 Dr.\n\u2022 Suhail Diab, professor of political science, argues that the digital media exposed Israeli practices, eroding trust even among U.S. allies, and that the wave of international support began after the world saw that Israeli crimes were \"unprecedented\" and exceeded all lines of restraint.\n\u2022 He cites that 14 UN Security Council members adopted a supportive stance, strengthening Washington\u2019s isolation.\n\u2022 Dr.\n\u2022 Ahmed Sid Ahmed, international relations expert, credits Egyptian diplomacy for bringing the Palestinian cause back to the international agenda, exposing Israel\u2019s malicious plan and reaffirming the two\u2011state solution.\n\u2022 He says Egypt\u2019s efforts have led to a shift in the positions of pro\u2011Israel allies, indicating that Israeli practices cannot be accepted internationally.\n\nPublished date: September 27 2025, 19:01\n\nSource: Albawaba\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Analytical\nContinent: Middle East\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation key: [9]\nTitle: Kurz erkl\u00e4rt: Kann es zu einer Zweistaatenl\u00f6sung kommen? | FAZ\n\nKey Points: \n\u2022 The article states that for decades many countries have advocated a two\u2011state solution in the Middle East, meaning a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\n\nPublished date: September 26 2025, 06:48\n\nSource: faz.net\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: 0\nReporting voice: Objective\nContinent: Middle East\n\n</doc>\n\n------News Summaries"

described the Israeli attacks as 'genocidio', which have already killed more than 65,200 Palestinians, including over 19,000 children.\n\u2022 Of the nearly 200 UN member states, 139 officially recognize Palestine.\n\u2022 In Latin America, only Panama has not recognized the Palestinian state; it voted against Palestine\u2019s admission as a non\u2011member observer state in 2012.\n\u2022 Panama was one of the first Latin American countries to recognize Israel\u2019s independence in 1948 and support its UN admission in 1949.\n\u2022 Other Latin American countries that have recognized Palestine include Cuba and Nicaragua.\n\u2022 The United States, the only permanent member of the Security Council that has not recognized Palestine, is also among those that have not done so.\n\u2022

surveys by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) and Pew Research Center, Israeli public opinion on the Gaza war has shifted since the October\u202f7,\u202f2023 Hamas attack.\n\u2022 In mid\u2011October 2023 only 17\u202f% of Israelis believed the Netanyahu government should negotiate a hostage release, but by the first anniversary that figure rose to 53\u202f%, and by mid\u2011July\u202f2024 74\u202f% supported a cease\u2011fire to free all hostages and end fighting.\n\u2022 The same surveys show that 79\u202f% of Jewish Israelis reported little concern for Palestinian suffering, while 86\u202f% of Arab Israelis expressed moderate to high concern.\n\u2022 Only 6\u202f% of respondents said the war should end because of the human cost or desire for peace.\n\u2022 Pew\u2019s latest data indicate 39\u202f% think Israel\u2019s military response is correct, 34\u202f% think it is insufficient, and 19\u202f% think it is excessive; 27\u202f% believe Israel will eventually achieve its objectives, 40\u202f% are certain it will.\n\u2022 Seventy\u2011one percent are extremely or very worried that the war could spread to other countries, and 68\u202f% fear a prolonged Gaza conflict.\n\u2022 Regarding Gaza\u2019s future, 40\u202f% of Israelis think Israel should govern the Strip, 14\u202f% want Gazans to decide, and 6\u202f% support a Palestinian unity government.\n\u2022 The article also reports that 82\u202f% of Jewish Israelis imagine a total expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza as a solution, and only 0.09\u202f% of the population has signed a petition for full Palestinian state recognition.\n\u2022 Despite these views, a March\u202f2024 poll found that 62\u202f% of Israelis believe the current government lacks majority confidence, while 27\u202f% think it still has it.\n\u2022 The article quotes scholars such as Tamir\u202fSorek, who says \u2018the attitudes that were once marginal are now mainstream,\u2019 and Dahlia\u202fScheindlin, who notes \u2018a general trend of hostility toward Gazans.\u2019.\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 10:19\n\nSource: El HuffPost\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment:

Israel is increasingly isolated worldwide as the Gaza war escalates, with backlash spilling into economic, cultural and sporting arenas.\n\u2022 The European Union has proposed sanctions that could partially suspend its free\u2011trade agreement with Israel, and several Western states have already imposed targeted sanctions on Israeli individuals, settler outposts and organisations linked to violence in the occupied West Bank.\n\u2022 Norway\u2019s sovereign\u2011wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, announced it would divest parts of its Israeli holdings, and France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom have imposed or threatened arms embargoes over Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza.\n\u2022 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a \u201ckind of isolation\u201d that could last for years, saying Israel must develop its weapons industry and adapt its economy to reduce reliance on external trade, though he later downplayed the remarks.\n\u2022 In the cultural sphere, broadcasters in Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain have threatened to boycott the Eurovision Song Contest if Israel participates in 2026, while the Irish national broadcaster RTE said it \u201cfeels that Ireland\u2019s participation would be unconscionable given the ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza.\u201d  The Belgian music festival in Ghent cancelled a concert by the Munich Philharmonic\u2019s Israeli conductor Lahav Shani, citing uncertainty about his stance on the \u201cgenocidal regime in Tel Aviv.\u201d  Hollywood actors and filmmakers, including Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield and Hannah Einbinder, pledged not to work with Israeli film institutions implicated in genocide and apartheid.\n\u2022 In sports, a major bike race stage was cancelled after pro\u2011Palestinian protests, a chess tournament in Spain barred Israeli players from competing under their national flag, and UEFA faced criticism after a banner reading \u201cStop killing children, Stop killing civilians\u201d was displayed at a Super Cup final.\n\u2022 The United Nations General Assembly saw several Western countries formally recognise a Palestinian state, and a UN commission report on genocide in Gaza has renewed focus on an ICC investigation.\n\u2022 Despite these pressures, the United States remains a steadfast ally, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio affirming that the U.S.\u2011Israel relationship will remain strong.\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 08:32\n\nSource: Yahoo News\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice:

internal and external crisis that could shape the country for a generation.\n\u2022 Internationally, 150 countries have recognised a Palestinian state, and Israel is experiencing economic, cultural and sporting boycotts.\n\u2022 Domestically, public trust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen to 40% according to an Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI) poll, despite broad support for the 12\u2011day Israel\u2011Iran war.\n\u2022 The IDI also found that two\u2011thirds of Israelis would support a hostage\u2011release deal in exchange for an end to the war, while 49% backed the security cabinet\u2019s decision to expand the Gaza operation.\n\u2022 Support for the war has dropped from 40% in March 2024 to 28% today.\n\u2022 Tal Schneider, a Times of Israel correspondent, notes a consensus of 70\u201175% on prioritising hostages, but a shift toward ending the war first: \"At the beginning [of the war], people believed you needed to finish the job inside Gaza.\n\u2022 But now, for at least a year, all polls suggest you need to get the hostages out first.\" \n\nPew Research found only 21% of Israelis believe peaceful coexistence with a Palestinian state is possible, the lowest level since 2013.\n\u2022 A Palestinian survey in Gaza showed 59% still support Hamas\u2019s 7\u2011October attack, while 87% do not believe the atrocities captured on video.\n\u2022 Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, said the international recognition of a Palestinian state is a \"fruit of October 7\" and a symbol of Palestinian dignity.\n\u2022 Netanyahu has described acceptance of a Palestinian state as \"national suicide\" and has urged Israelis to endure the conflict, calling the country a \"Super Sparta\".\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 06:00\n\nSource:

recognition of a Palestinian state has been met by Netanyahu\u2019s attempts to tie such recognition to a reward for Hamas, a stance echoed by Washington, and that the U.S. president has pledged not

wave of UN member states recognizing the State of Palestine\u2014now more than 82% of the 193 UN members\u2014serves not only symbolic diplomatic purposes but also strategic pressure on Israel.\n\u2022 It cites that the Security Council has blocked recognition six times, yet Spain and Ireland revived the effort in May\u202f2024, and three G\u20117 members\u2014Canada, France and the United Kingdom\u2014have joined.\n\u2022 The author calls the Israeli government a 'Gobierno criminal israel\u00ed' and claims that recognition, combined with international judicial actions against Netanyahu, EU sanctions, and civil mobilization such as protests during the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and Eurovision, can shift Israeli public opinion and ultimately lead to change.\n\u2022 The piece draws parallels with the South\u2011Africa apartheid boycott, noting that it took over three decades to dismantle the regime.\n\u2022 The column also references the historical example of Jamaica\u2019s 1959 export ban and South Africa\u2019s 1990 economic collapse, using these to illustrate how diplomatic, economic, social, cultural and sporting pressures can eventually force a regime to change.\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 03:00\n\nSource: EL PA\u00cdS\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Advocacy\nContinent: Middle East\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation

family\u2019s history and his views on the Israeli state.\n\u2022 He recounts that his mother, Efratia Margalit, was born in Tel Aviv in 1909, and his father, Munio Weinraub Gitai, was a Bauhaus student who fled Nazi Germany and settled in British Palestine.\n\u2022 Gitai explains that his parents were part of the early socialist\u2011Zionist movement that envisioned a modern, secular Jewish society, and he argues that the idea of Israel as a state predates the Holocaust, citing the early 19th\u2011century immigration wave.\n\u2022 He notes that the image of Jews shifted from merchants and intellectuals to soldiers and farmers after the rise of the labor movement and the 1970s decline of the Labor Party.\n\u2022 Gitai says the current regime is overly militaristic and that its attempts to \"destroy Gaza\" reflect a destructive strategy.\n\u2022 He warns that \"if the regime continues like this it could destroy the country,\" echoing his quote: 'Se il regime continuer\u00e0 cos\u00ec potrebbe distruggere Israele.' He also comments on the persecution of Israeli artists abroad, the boycott of artists who support oppression, and the difficulty of living in a country surrounded by hostility.\n\u2022 Key quotes: \n- 'Il problema di Israele \u00e8 l\u2019essere diventato troppo forte militarmente.'\n- 'Se il regime continuer\u00e0 cos\u00ec potrebbe distruggere Israele.'.\n\nPublished date: September 27 2025, 23:18\n\nSource: lastampa.it\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Narrative\nContinent: Middle East\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation key: [8]\nTitle: \u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0627\u062d \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0634\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u064a\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629\u061f.. \u062e\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0621: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0642\u0629 \u062d\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0628\u0648\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0623\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a \u0644\u062f\u0639\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0636\u0639\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0632\u0629\n\nKey Points: \n\u2022 The Palestinian cause has recently gained unprecedented international momentum, highlighted by the 80th UN General Assembly where 159 of 196 member states recognized the state of Palestine, while only about 10 countries, mainly Israel and the United States, opposed the resolution.\n\u2022 Experts say that the unprecedented Israeli war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank have awakened global political awareness and shifted public opinion toward supporting the oppressed in Gaza.\n\u2022 Dr.\n\u2022 Amin Al\u2011Mashaqaba, former Jordanian minister and political science professor, notes that the recognition of Palestine by 159 states is a key indicator of success, and points out that the isolation of Israel is evident in the withdrawal of most delegations from the UN General Assembly in protest of Israeli conduct.\n\u2022 Dr.\n\u2022 Suhail Diab, professor of political science, argues that the digital media exposed Israeli practices, eroding trust even among U.S. allies, and that the wave of international support began after the world saw that Israeli crimes were \"unprecedented\" and exceeded all lines of restraint.\n\u2022 He cites that 14 UN Security Council members adopted a supportive stance, strengthening Washington\u2019s isolation.\n\u2022 Dr.\n\u2022 Ahmed Sid Ahmed, international relations expert, credits Egyptian diplomacy for bringing the Palestinian cause back to the international agenda, exposing Israel\u2019s malicious plan and reaffirming the two\u2011state solution.\n\u2022 He says Egypt\u2019s efforts have led to a shift in the positions of pro\u2011Israel allies, indicating that Israeli practices cannot be accepted internationally.\n\nPublished date: September 27 2025, 19:01\n\nSource: Albawaba\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Analytical\nContinent: Middle East\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation key: [9]\nTitle: Kurz erkl\u00e4rt: Kann es zu einer Zweistaatenl\u00f6sung kommen? | FAZ\n\nKey Points: \n\u2022 The article states that for decades many countries have advocated a two\u2011state solution in the Middle East, meaning a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\n\nPublished date: September 26 2025, 06:48\n\nSource: faz.net\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: 0\nReporting voice: Objective\nContinent: Middle East\n\n</doc>\n\n------News Summaries",

    "summary": "Across a spectrum of experts\u2014spanning international development, democracy assessment, political science, economics, and Middle East studies\u2014there is broad consensus that Israel is likely, but not certain, to remain a highly developed liberal democracy as defined by its HDI (top 50 globally) and LDI (\u22650.5 on the V-Dem index) through 2034. Most experts assign this a probability in the 70\u201380% range, reflecting heightened but not imminent risk of regression. Commonly cited factors increasing the probability include Israel's resilient and innovative economy, entrenched core institutions, robust civil society, and ongoing strategic support from the United States. These support the persistence of high HDI, and, to a lesser degree, of liberal-democratic institutions. However, several converging risk factors temper optimism. These include unprecedented international isolation and sanctions, political polarization, normalization of illiberal rhetoric, the judicial reform crisis, persistent conflict, and societal fragmentation\u2014any of which could significantly erode LDI scores if not checked. Experts see democratic backsliding as the more vulnerable metric: while HDI is seen as relatively robust absent catastrophic economic shocks, LDI could fall below the 0.5 threshold if democratic erosion accelerates (via weakened judicial independence, emergency rule, curtailed minority rights, or entrenched illiberal governance). Nonetheless, the historical rarity of advanced democracies losing both high development and liberal democracy status in a single decade\u2014absent regime collapse or major war\u2014anchors forecasts toward a Yes outcome. The main uncertainty is whether mounting risk factors will interact over time to push Israel below either threshold. In sum, the expert consensus points to a moderately high likelihood that Israel will meet both criteria in 2034, with significant, elevated tail risk due to current domestic and international pressures.",
