The motion, introduced by David Garcia Nu\u00f1ez (AL) and Anna Graff (SP), seeks to reduce working hours to 35 per week while keeping full pay, targeting staff in the VBZ, police and care sectors. Leupi cited high costs and the risk that reduced hours could leave up to 1,500 specialists short. A legal opinion concluded that a pilot would constitute a 'massive Eingriff in das st\u00e4dtische Recht und insbesondere sein Lohnsystem' and that a statutory framework would be needed to comply with Article\u202f8 of the Swiss Constitution. The motioners accused the council of a delay tactic and demanded the matter be referred to a commission. The council rejected the extension request, leaving Leupi to answer the commission. The debate echoes a 2023 pilot in hospitals where 70 assistant doctors worked 42 hours instead of 46. 45\u202f% of Swiss workers reported that resources and burdens in their work life are just balancing, according to recent surveys. The motioners\u2019 pilot would involve staff in shift work, such as those in the VBZ, police or care sector. Leupi warned that a reduction could result in a shortage of up to 1,500 specialists. The legal opinion noted that the city, as an employer, must treat all employees equally and that a pilot would be a 'massive Eingriff in das st\u00e4dtische Recht und insbesondere sein Lohnsystem'.

City Manager Wendy Stephanson announced on August\u202f26 that the mandate would take effect on Jan.\u202f1, stating that a five\u2011day office standard would strengthen organizational culture and build public trust. Councillor Jeff Leiper will introduce a motion arguing that no evidence shows reduced productivity or taxpayer value under the current hybrid arrangement, and that a five\u2011day standard would not significantly improve either. The motion would direct the city manager to rescind the mandate and continue to accommodate hybrid work. Horizon Ottawa and several unions\u2014including the Civic Institute of Professional Personnel, the Amalgamated Transit Union, the Canadian Association of Professional Employees and the Public Service Alliance of Canada\u2014will rally outside City Hall to support Leiper\u2019s motion. Tom Ledgley, Coordinator of Horizon Ottawa, said, 'Remote work technology and practices are well\u2011developed and effective,' and that studies show productivity remains strong when people work from home. Ottawa employs about 17,100 full\u2011time equivalent positions, with roughly 85\u202f% of staff onsite each day. Stephanson clarified that alternative work arrangements will remain available, and that a regular on\u2011site presence is 'critical to help strengthen relationships, reinforce team norms, support formal systems and processes, facilitate ongoing knowledge transfer, support mentorship and succession planning, protect the integrity of our corporate memory, build confidence in the city's ability to deliver service excellence, and ultimately strengthen public trust.' The motion comes amid Ontario\u2019s mandate that all members of the Ontario Public Service be in the office four days a week from November, and federal core public service employees must be in the office at least three days a week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 12:29 PM\nSource:[Pulse24.com                        ](https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/09/24/council-to-vote-today-on-motion-to-rescind-ottawas-return-to-office-mandate/)\n\n**985 Management Trainees Work 12\u2011Hour Shifts Daily \u2013 Wuling Responds to Recruitment Controversy**\nIn September 2025, a report from the \"Next\u2011Generation Vehicle Research Institute\" column revealed that Shanghai\u2011General\u2011Wuling (SGW) had recruited roughly 800 graduates from 985 and 211 universities as management trainees (\u7ba1\u57f9\u751f).  The trainees reported that, contrary to the 9\u2011to\u20115, five\u2011day schedule advertised during campus recruitment, they were required to work from 8\u202fa.m. to 8\u202fp.m., six to seven days a week, for a continuous six\u2011month period before being assigned to a permanent role.  The company\u2019s official statement acknowledged a 6\u2011month front\u2011line training period and claimed that a dual\u2011person rotation system had been introduced to reduce daily hours, but the trainees said the rotation had not yet been implemented.  The column quoted several trainees: \u2018I was told the training would be 9\u20115 for five days, but after two weeks of hard work I\u2019ve been on the line for a month with no rotation or transfer notice.\u2019  Experts warned that such prolonged, high\u2011intensity work could compromise product quality and lead to talent loss.

Microsoft has laid off more than 15,000 workers since early\u202f2025, and the RTO mandate is seen by some as a tool for workforce reduction. The policy will affect 53,000 employees based at the Redmond campus, potentially increasing traffic in the Puget Sound area. Kevin\u202fO\u2019Leary, a Shark Tank investor, publicly criticized the 9\u2011to\u20115 office model, stating on LinkedIn: 'I don't believe in the 9 to 5 job market any more. None of my team works in an office any more because they don't want to. We have people working for us all around the world. We somehow are very, very productive and that's the new economy.' He added, 'I don't care when you get it done. I don't care if it's two in the morning or eight in the morning. There is no 9 to 5. Just get it done by the deadline.' The article notes that RTO policies are increasingly used as a performance metric and a subtle way to prompt resignations or terminations.

Understanding the Current Scenario**\nThe article discusses the possible end of home office in Brazil by 2025, highlighting a growing trend toward in\u2011person work among large companies while noting that remote work remains highly valued by employees. According to a survey by Grupo Top RH with Infojobs, '85,3% of Brazilian professionals would change jobs for more remote days per week', indicating strong demand for flexibility. Market data from Gupy shows that only '5% of job postings in June 2024 were fully remote', compared with '87,2% that were in\u2011person', and the number of in\u2011person hires rose from 55,000 in April 2023 to 87,000 in April 2024. The IBGE reports that just '8,3% of Brazilian workers work exclusively remotely'. Major global firms such as Amazon and Apple have already implemented partial return policies, requiring employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The article warns that abrupt termination of remote work can lead to employee resistance, lower motivation, higher turnover, and deteriorating workplace culture. It also outlines the legal framework under Brazil\u2019s Consolidated Labor Laws (CLT), which allows employers to mandate a return to the office with a minimum 15\u2011day notice and a contractual addendum, but employees may retain remote work if health risks are proven. Finally, the piece suggests hybrid work as a balanced solution, citing ABRH Brasil research that shows hybrid models are as popular as fully in\u2011person arrangements.

The report found that participants used the program for various reasons, including self-development (48%), childcare and education (28%), and health and leisure. The program's 'hybrid' work system, which allows employees to work 32-38 hours a week without adjusting their workload, was highly praised by users. However, the report also noted that the program's entry barrier is the reduction in wages, with 44% of respondents expressing negative opinions on continuing to use the program after the wage support ends. The report concludes that the program's success depends on the organization's culture, and that a mutual understanding and respect culture is essential for the program's successful implementation. 'The 0.5&0.75 job program is not just a simple work-time reduction policy, but a effective alternative for achieving work-life balance,' said Kim Min-young, a researcher at the Gyeonggi Province Job Foundation.

The SECJ helps young people (15-30 years old), particularly those facing employment obstacles, to obtain employment support, skill-based training, and professional experience needed to integrate the labor market. The EEC program, administered by Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, provides salary subsidies to non-profit and public sector employers, as well as private sector organizations with 50 or fewer full-time employees, to offer quality summer jobs to young people aged 15-30. The funded jobs allow young people to improve their skills or acquire new ones. For many young people, it is their first work experience, which will influence their future education and career choices. The program takes into account national and local priorities, as well as labor market needs. Projects that support young people facing employment obstacles are prioritized, including those with disabilities, Indigenous youth, Black or 2ELGBTQI+ youth, and youth from racialized groups, rural or remote communities, or minority language communities. By offering young people equal opportunities to improve their skills, EEC facilitates their success in the labor market. The jobs funded by the EEC program are full-time (30-40 hours per week) and last 6-16 weeks, with an average of 8 weeks at 35 hours per week. The hiring period for young people for 2025 runs from April 21 to July 21, 2025, and the jobs will end no later than August 30, 2025. Up to 76,000 jobs counting for young people and our communities will be posted on the Government of Canada's Job Bank website and mobile app, which will be regularly updated. Young people can therefore frequently check the Job Bank to see which new jobs are offered in their community.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 05:21 PM\nSource:[Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/fr/emploi-developpement-social/nouvelles/2025/06/document-dinformation--emplois-dete-canada-2025.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014including nonprofit administration, human resources, organizational sociology, and labor economics\u2014there is a strong consensus that the Forethought Foundation is highly likely to end 2025 with two or fewer full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. All experts note that the Foundation has historically operated with a lean core staff (1\u20132 FTEs), relying on contractors, academic affiliates, and part-timers. No credible, recent evidence or public signals suggest a major strategic expansion, new funding windfall, or hiring push that would necessitate growing beyond this level. Sector norms for small, academically-oriented think tanks\u2014especially those aligned with effective altruism\u2014favor maintaining minimal permanent staff, and the current funding climate, especially post-FTX, makes aggressive hiring unlikely. Experts also emphasize that the absence of hiring announcements or organizational updates throughout 2024 and 2025 further reduces the probability of change. Most assign a 15\u201320% chance of a 'Yes' outcome (more than two FTEs), with one expert allowing up to 25% for the small possibility of a late-year expansion. All agree that, barring an unexpected grant or strategic shift, the base rate and organizational incentives favor a negative resolution: the Foundation will likely have two or fewer FTEs at the end of 2025.",
