Bundled interventions often create confusion, especially when trust is shallow and previous health system contact is limited. You're also skating past the nontrivial risk that publication or reporting delays (notoriously common in African RCTs) could deliver a technical 'No.' If you want to apply a true postcolonial lens, skepticism about the universal transferability of 'proven models' should be front and center.

The original question opened on 2024-10-23 16:00:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/28373). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAccording to [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024):\n\n>In May 2024, GiveWell made a $676,857 grant to Wageningen University to include additional components to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of door-to-door health service delivery in remote communities in Sierra Leone. Non-GiveWell funding was already covering one round of service delivery and surveys, including the provision of routine childhood and HPV vaccines, vitamin A supplements, and deworming pills. This grant will add chlorine, for disinfecting drinking water, and oral rehydration solution (ORS) and zinc, for treating dehydration due to diarrhea, to the bundle of health services that will be delivered, and will support a second round of service delivery and surveys 3 months after the initial round.\n\nGiveWell estimates that reduction in diarrhea deaths via chlorine and ORS/zinc could raise the cost-effectiveness estimate of health commodities distribution programs like this one, if usage is high.\n\nThe study's design is as follows:\n\n>The study will be a cluster-randomized RCT in which the treatment communities receive household-to-household visits from health teams offering routine childhood and HPV vaccines to those who have not received all of the vaccines in the vaccination schedule. Households with children under the age of 5 will also be offered VAS, deworming pills, chlorine to treat drinking water, and ORS/zinc to treat future diarrhea episodes. Control communities will not receive any interventions. The health teams will also provide information on when young children are due for subsequent vaccines. The health teams will return after three months and provide the same bundle of services.\n\nResults of the study, if a statistically significant increase can be shown, will have implications for GiveWell\u2019s future funding of similar interventions:\n>GiveWell is considering supporting programs that deliver vaccines to communities far from public health facilities, as one strategy to increase vaccination coverage in areas with high vaccine-preventable disease burdens. Chlorine and ORS/zinc, if usage rates are reasonably high, have the potential to increase the cost-effectiveness of such programs. (More [here](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/wageningen-university-sierra-leone-rct-2024#We_expect_this_study_to_have_a_decent_chance_of_affecting_our_future_grant_decisions).)\n\nIn the grant rationale, GiveWell explains some potential reasons the study might fail:\n\n- Recipients might be overwhelmed by the quantity of health services they\u2019re receiving (childhood vaccines, HPV vaccines, VAS, deworming) and not process instructions on ORS/zinc usage. \n- Recipients might not use either ORS/zinc or chlorine if they view these commodities as substitutes for each other. \n- People in areas with very little contact with health systems might react to health information or commodities differently than people in other areas.\n\nIn its own internal forecasting, GiveWell predicts a 70% chance that the study measures a statistically significant increase in ORS/zinc usage in the treatment group over the two rounds of distribution.\n\nFor more context on the commodity being distributed, see also the GiveWell report: [Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and Zinc\n](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/oral-rehydration-solution-zinc)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":28373,\"question_id\":28373}}`",

The study, supported by UNICEF and GAVI, surveyed caregivers, communities and health providers in Vientiane, Sekong and Oudomxay provinces and identified gaps in immunisation coverage, especially among ethnic minority groups and hard\u2011to\u2011reach communities. Barriers cited include long distances to health facilities, poor road conditions, cultural practices that restrict newborn mobility, vaccine stockouts, irregular outreach and weak communication between health workers and caregivers. Associate Professor Vanphanom Sychareun, Dean of the Faculty of Public Health, said the findings demonstrate the need for targeted, equity\u2011focused interventions that strengthen service delivery and empower communities, stressing that no child should be left behind. Vice President Somchai Lathsavong noted that the Ministry of Health welcomed the findings and would intensify efforts to reach disadvantaged communities, reaffirming its commitment to removing barriers and protecting every child against preventable diseases. UNICEF Deputy Representative Magali Romedenne described the research as a roadmap for action, emphasising stronger outreach, consistent vaccine supply and improved engagement to help Laos reach its national target of 95\u202fpercent immunisation coverage and align with the global Immunisation Agenda\u202f2030. In response, the Ministry of Health launched new \u201cPink Book\u201d resources on 19\u202fMay, with support from WHO, UNICEF, Gavi and the Australian Government. The tools, designed for low\u2011literacy populations and ethnic minorities, include animated videos and infographic\u2011style flashcards covering key vaccines and vaccine\u2011preventable diseases. Deputy Director General Viengkhan Phixay said the materials provide healthcare workers and community leaders with clear, visual tools to explain vaccine safety and importance, particularly in areas facing language or literacy barriers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[laotiantimes.com](https://laotiantimes.com/2025/09/22/study-reveals-gaps-in-childhood-vaccination-across-laos/)\n\n**Human papillomavirus, sexually transmitted infections, and antimicrobial resistance in West Africa: Estimating population burden and understanding exposures to accelerate vaccine impact and drive new interventions: The PHASE survey protocol**\nThe article reports that in May 2018 the WHO Director\u2011General announced a Joint Global Commitment to Cervical Cancer Elimination, yet in 2018 approximately 311,000 women died from cervical cancer worldwide and 570,000 were newly diagnosed, with around 90% of the deaths occurring in low\u2011 and middle\u2011income countries and cervical cancer ranking as the first or second most common cause of female cancer\u2011related death in sub\u2011Saharan Africa.  The number of deaths in Africa is projected to double by 2040, underscoring the inequality in disease burden.  HPV vaccines are highlighted as essential for reversing these trends; six vaccines are licensed, including bivalent (Cervarix, Cecolin, Walrinvax), quadrivalent (Gardasil, Cervavac) and nonavalent (Gardasil9) formulations that target high\u2011risk HPV types 16 and 18 and, in the case of Gardasil9, additional high\u2011risk types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58.  Clinical trials in high\u2011income countries showed high efficacy against vaccine\u2011type cervical cancer in HPV\u2011na\u00efve 16\u201126\u2011year\u2011olds, and immunobridging studies support use in 9\u201114\u2011year\u2011olds, the age group WHO recommends for global rollout.  The WHO has approved a single\u2011dose schedule for most HPV vaccines based on observational studies and trials, but data from low\u2011income settings are lacking.  The article notes that in The Gambia, a two\u2011dose schedule was introduced in 2019 for 9\u201114\u2011year\u2011olds, but coverage fell to 23% for the first dose in 2024 due to COVID\u201119 interruptions.  It calls for baseline data on HPV prevalence and associated exposures in West Africa to monitor vaccine impact, assess long\u2011term immunity, and inform modelling studies.  The article quotes that \"The Gambia introduced a two\u2011dose HPV vaccination schedule to be administered to 9\u201114\u2011year\u2011old girls in 2019 as a national school\u2011based campaign program\" and that \"the coverage has been very low, 23% for the first dose in 2024\".

The model found that a dose of MCV1 given before one year of age produced a 93\u202f% (CI\u202f89\u201197) seroconversion rate, the same 93\u202f% (CI\u202f87\u201197) rate for a dose given between 12\u201118\u202fmonths, and 76\u202f% (CI\u202f69\u201184) for older children.  In the study period, MCV1 accounted for more than 50\u202f% of all seroconversions, natural infection 24\u202f%, and SIAs 16\u202f%.  The authors noted that a 10\u202f% higher MCV1 coverage would have lowered residual susceptibility by about 50\u202f% and reduced reliance on SIAs.  Delivering MCV1 at nine months rather than eleven months increased seroconversions by 7\u202f%, underscoring the importance of timeliness.  MCV2 contributed only 1\u202f% of total seroconversions since its introduction, rising from 0.2\u202f% in 2015 to 3\u202f% in 2021, and the authors argue that boosting MCV1 coverage would have a larger impact than increasing MCV2.  SIAs, though high\u2011coverage, contributed roughly 14\u202f% of seroconversions; the model suggests that achieving 95\u202f% coverage of both doses would reduce the SIA contribution to 3\u202f%.  The authors conclude that modest improvements in routine coverage and timing\u2014particularly of MCV1\u2014and the potential roll\u2011out of the RTS,S malaria vaccine could substantially reduce measles transmission and the cost of frequent SIAs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013531)\n\n**Health Ministry adopts monoclonal antibodies in preventive vaccination schedule**\nThe Ministry of Health, through a ministerial decree issued by Dr. Ahmed Al\u2011Awadi, has approved the inclusion of the RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccine and monoclonal antibodies in the optional preventive vaccination schedule. The decree, announced in a statement released on Sunday, states that the decision \"is based on the recommendations of the national scientific committees\" and is part of the ministry\u2019s seasonal immunisation plan that aligns with the latest global medical developments. The decree specifies that the RSV vaccine and monoclonal antibodies will be offered as an effective preventive measure for high\u2011risk groups. Global medical studies have shown that these interventions \"reduce severe cases, lower hospitalisation rates, and help control the spread of the virus.\" RSV is described as one of the most common respiratory viruses, especially during the fall and winter seasons, with the highest infection rates among infants, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses. The Ministry notes that major international health bodies\u2014including the U.S. CDC and the European Medicines Agency\u2014have adopted this type of vaccination as part of seasonal prevention strategies and that it is currently used in several advanced health systems worldwide to protect vulnerable populations such as newborns and the elderly. The decree covers vaccination for two child groups: newborns and infants under 8 months during the virus season, and children aged 8 months to 2 years who have chronic diseases or special health conditions such as congenital heart disease or immunodeficiency. It also states that vaccination will be provided for other risk groups\u2014elderly people, chronic disease patients and pregnant women\u2014to offer protective care for newborns after birth. The Ministry emphasises that this decision is part of a proactive national policy aimed at strengthening community immunity, reducing the burden on emergency and intensive\u2011care departments, and urges citizens and residents to follow health guidelines and seek vaccination at approved centres when it becomes available.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 07:03 PM\nSource:[Alrai-media](https://www.alraimedia.com/article/1740751/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AC%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**Chickenpox vaccine programme to launch in January 2026, government confirms**\nChildren across England will receive the chickenpox vaccine for the first time from 2026 as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule, the government announced. The vaccine will be delivered as a combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) shot at GP appointments, with an expected coverage of about half a million children each year. Until now, parents who chose private vaccination paid roughly \u00a3150 for the two\u2011dose course. The programme is expected to cut school and nursery absences and save the UK economy \u00a324\u202fmillion a year, while NHS treatment costs could fall by about \u00a315\u202fmillion annually. Minister of State for Care Stephen Kinnock said the rollout will give parents 'the power to protect' children from the potentially dangerous illness and that it 'puts children\u2019s health first and gives working families the support they deserve.' Amanda Doyle, national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, added that the government will work with GP surgeries and vaccination teams to ensure effective delivery. The decision follows advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and is based on evidence of the burden of severe chickenpox cases. A study by University College London and Keele University found that around three quarters of UK parents supported the introduction of the vaccine into the routine schedule. The government also confirmed that the shingles vaccine will be offered to hundreds of thousands more immunosuppressed adults from next week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[nursinginpractice.com](https://www.nursinginpractice.com/clinical/vaccination-and-infection/chickenpox-vaccine-programme-to-launch-in-january-2026-government-confirms/)\n\n**Two new studies predict results of declining MMR uptake, restricting non-medical vaccine exemptions**\nA modeling study led by University of Texas researchers estimated that a 5% decline in kindergarten MMR vaccination would markedly increase measles outbreak sizes in Texas counties. Using a mathematical model calibrated with local vaccination rates and case data from Gaines County, the study projected that under a baseline scenario (current rates) Gaines and Walker counties would see 14 measles cases per 1,000 people, while a 5% reduction would raise cases to 21 per 1,000 in Gaines and 16 per 1,000 in Walker, with hospitalizations rising from 1\u20132 to 3\u20134 per 1,000. Conversely, a 5% increase in coverage would keep all counties below 15 cases and 3 hospitalizations per 1,000. The study highlighted that the 2025 West Texas outbreak infected 762 people, hospitalized 99, and caused 2 deaths, underscoring the risk of waning community immunity. The authors noted, 'These events underscore the challenges in maintaining community immunity in the setting of vaccine hesitancy and disruption of routine vaccination programs, including drops in MMR coverage.'\n\nA second study from Johns Hopkins University examined the impact of non\u2011medical exemption (NME) policies on MMR uptake across 33 states before and during the 2022\u201123 and 2023\u201124 school years. It found that 26 of 33 states experienced statistically significant changes in county\u2011level MMR rates, with only California, Connecticut, Maine, and New York showing significant increases. States permitting both religious and philosophical exemptions saw the largest declines in MMR rates, dropping 3.8% on average from 93.3% to 89.5%. In contrast, states that prohibited all NMEs (NME_0) saw a slight decline of 0.8%, while those that removed NMEs during the study period (NME_3) experienced a 1.7% increase. The authors wrote, 'These outcomes are of particular importance given recently passed and pending state legislation to increase access to vaccination exemptions in over 15 states,' and concluded that evidence\u2011based policy reform is urgently needed to protect public health.\n\nBoth studies emphasize that policy changes affecting vaccine recommendations and exemption laws can have measurable effects on vaccination coverage and outbreak risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:42 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/two-new-studies-predict-results-declining-mmr-uptake-restricting-non-medical)\n\n**Lombardy Launches 2025/2026 Flu Vaccination Campaign Prioritising Vulnerable Groups**\nOn 1\u202fOctober 2025 Lombardy will launch its 2025/2026 influenza vaccination campaign, prioritising vulnerable groups.

The analysis found no significant difference between the IDC and control groups for all\u2011cause mortality, cardiovascular events (a composite of cardiovascular deaths and hospitalisations), all\u2011cause hospitalisations or hospital length of stay. Age was associated with a 3.2% increased risk of cardiovascular events per additional year, and diabetes with an 89% increased risk. The cohort had a 5\u2011year mortality of 55%, with 18% of deaths attributable to cardiovascular causes.\n\nThe authors compared their results with other exercise trials. The EXCITE trial, which used a six\u2011month home walking programme, reported a 29% reduction in the composite outcome of hospitalisation and mortality (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50\u20131.00, p\u202f=\u202f0.06) at 36 months post\u2011trial. The DIATT trial, a 12\u2011month intradialytic exercise programme, showed significant reductions in hospitalisations (p\u202f=\u202f0.024) and days in hospital (p\u202f=\u202f0.036). Another study reported a 12\u2011month mortality HR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.04\u20130.8, p\u202f=\u202f0.02) after a six\u2011month IDC programme, though the confidence interval was wide.\n\nThe CYCLE\u2011HD data indicated a non\u2011significant 9% reduction in hospitalisations, consistent with earlier findings that IDC is cost\u2011effective mainly through fewer admissions. A post\u2011hoc sample\u2011size calculation suggested that 955 participants would be required to detect a statistically significant 9% reduction in hospitalisations. Limitations include the small sample size, post\u2011hoc design, lack of sustained exercise after the initial six months, and potential missing hospitalisation data outside the University Hospitals of Leicester.\n\nOverall, the study concludes that a six\u2011month IDC programme alone does not improve long\u2011term survival or reduce cardiovascular events or hospitalisations in haemodialysis patients, highlighting the need for larger, adequately powered trials to assess the clinical impact of exercise interventions in this population.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0332389)\n\n**US vaccine advisers abandon broad recommendation for COVID shots**\nOn September 22, 2025, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), chaired by Health Secretary Robert F.

The decision followed a Thursday vote that recommended against giving the combined measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella\u2011varicella (MMRV) shot to children under four, and a Friday re\u2011vote that aligned the federal childhood vaccine program with the panel\u2019s recommendations. The panel, reconstituted this year by Kennedy, includes members who have previously expressed concerns about routine vaccines or opposed COVID shots; five new members began their terms on Monday. Members of the COVID vaccine working group cited potential safety issues that warrant further study. In contrast, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer (partnering with BioNTech), Moderna, and Sanofi (partnering with Novavax) defended the safety and effectiveness of their products. The CDC presented data showing that COVID\u201119 vaccination provides additional protection against emergency department visits in children and adults, and against hospitalizations and critical illness in adults 65 and older, noting that U.S. hospitalization rates from COVID are highest for adults 65 and older and infants under six months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 01:19 AM\nSource:[ETHealthworld.com](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/us-vaccine-advisors-shift-stance-on-covid-19-shots-favor-physician-guidance/124035384)\n\n**Health Ministry adopts monoclonal antibodies in preventive vaccination schedule**\nThe Ministry of Health, through a ministerial decree issued by Dr. Ahmed Al\u2011Awadi, has approved the inclusion of the RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccine and monoclonal antibodies in the optional preventive vaccination schedule. The decree, announced in a statement released on Sunday, states that the decision \"is based on the recommendations of the national scientific committees\" and is part of the ministry\u2019s seasonal immunisation plan that aligns with the latest global medical developments. The decree specifies that the RSV vaccine and monoclonal antibodies will be offered as an effective preventive measure for high\u2011risk groups. Global medical studies have shown that these interventions \"reduce severe cases, lower hospitalisation rates, and help control the spread of the virus.\" RSV is described as one of the most common respiratory viruses, especially during the fall and winter seasons, with the highest infection rates among infants, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses. The Ministry notes that major international health bodies\u2014including the U.S. CDC and the European Medicines Agency\u2014have adopted this type of vaccination as part of seasonal prevention strategies and that it is currently used in several advanced health systems worldwide to protect vulnerable populations such as newborns and the elderly. The decree covers vaccination for two child groups: newborns and infants under 8 months during the virus season, and children aged 8 months to 2 years who have chronic diseases or special health conditions such as congenital heart disease or immunodeficiency. It also states that vaccination will be provided for other risk groups\u2014elderly people, chronic disease patients and pregnant women\u2014to offer protective care for newborns after birth. The Ministry emphasises that this decision is part of a proactive national policy aimed at strengthening community immunity, reducing the burden on emergency and intensive\u2011care departments, and urges citizens and residents to follow health guidelines and seek vaccination at approved centres when it becomes available.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 07:03 PM\nSource:[Alrai-media](https://www.alraimedia.com/article/1740751/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AC%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**School Vaccination Campaigns Offered Free by Ministry of Health for Students**\nDr. Mustafa Mohammedi, a consultant in internal medicine, announced the key school vaccinations that the Ministry of Health will provide free of charge for students during the 2025/2026 academic year. According to Mohammedi, students in second and fourth primary grades will receive a booster dose of the diphtheria\u2011tetanus (Td) vaccine at school. Students in the first grades of each level\u2014including KG1, first primary, first preparatory, and first secondary\u2014will receive a dose of the combined measles\u2011rubella vaccine (A,C). The Ministry will send consent forms to parents before vaccination, noting that the Td vaccine is recommended for approval because it is difficult to obtain outside the campaign, while the measles\u2011rubella vaccine can be declined if the child has already been vaccinated. The Ministry also launched a comprehensive health insurance plan for the 2025/2026 school year, aiming to strengthen preventive care and basic health services in educational institutions, especially in rural areas. The plan includes updating the infectious disease guideline, training 650 disease\u2011control staff in schools, and establishing 3,450 trained medical teams (doctors, nurses, dentists) to target first\u2011grade students across all educational levels, with referrals to health insurance for treatment.

The blog states, 'We estimate that our 2024 grantmaking will reach around 34\u202fmillion people and save 74,000 lives,' covering 17 mortality\u2011focused grants and excluding 38 other grants.  GiveWell raised $415\u202fmillion during its 2024 metrics year (February\u202f2024\u202f\u2013\u202fJanuary\u202f2025) and directed $397\u202fmillion to cost\u2011effective programs, with nearly $270\u202fmillion allocated to malaria prevention.  The largest single grant was a $96.3\u202fmillion donation to the Against\u202fMalaria\u202fFoundation for insecticide\u2011treated net campaigns in four countries.  Other funded areas include tuberculosis, malnutrition, diarrheal disease, vitamin\u202fA deficiency, kangaroo mother care, in\u2011line chlorination, and vaccine incentives.  The blog notes that the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program\u2019s primary USAID funding was discontinued in February\u202f2025, a change reported by The Brookings Institution.  In a podcast episode recorded on August\u202f13\u202f2025, CEO Elie\u202fHassenfeld and Senior Researcher Adam\u202fSalisbury discuss the potential impact of this funding gap on GiveWell\u2019s research and on evidence\u2011based grantmaking worldwide.  The blog also highlights a recent grant to New\u202fIncentives in Northern\u202fNigeria: a $19.1\u202fmillion program that will provide small cash incentives to caregivers for routine childhood vaccinations, expected to avert over 7,600 deaths and reach about 170,000 children who would otherwise remain unvaccinated.

Pediatric gastroenterologist Ekong Udoh noted that the disease causes about 2.9\u202fmillion cases and 95,000 deaths worldwide each year, with Africa accounting for over 90\u202f% of the burden. In Nigeria, 4,809 suspected cases and 156 deaths were reported in 2024, compared with 260 deaths in northern Nigeria in 2009. Udoh explained that 75\u202f% of infected people are asymptomatic yet shed bacteria for up to two weeks, and that 20\u202f% of symptomatic patients develop severe dehydration; untreated cholera can kill 30\u201350\u202f% of cases. He stressed that prompt fluid replacement with oral rehydration solution (ORS) is life\u2011saving, but access to care remains limited in remote areas. Antibiotic resistance is emerging, with strains resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline already documented. Prevention, he argued, is cheaper and more effective: boiling water, handwashing, and proper food handling can cut diarrhoea by 26\u201362\u202f%. Oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) such as Shanchol and Euvichol provide up to 65\u202f% protection for five years, while a single dose of Shanchol can reduce cases by 40\u202f% at six months. Dr. Ekpereonne Esu added that OCVs are WHO\u2011prequalified and can be given to individuals from one year of age, including pregnant women and those with HIV. He cited trials showing a two\u2011dose Dukoral regimen reduced cases by 76\u202f% at two years, and Shanchol reduced severe disease by 63\u202f%. Esu warned that vaccines alone cannot end cholera; they must be coupled with improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure. He called for political will, community engagement and sustained investment to accelerate prevention and control.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 31, 2025 04:55 AM\nSource:[Businessday NG](https://businessday.ng/health/article/cholera-remains-public-health-challenge-university-dons/)\n\n**Chickenpox vaccine programme to launch in January 2026, government confirms**\nChildren across England will receive the chickenpox vaccine for the first time from 2026 as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule, the government announced. The vaccine will be delivered as a combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) shot at GP appointments, with an expected coverage of about half a million children each year. Until now, parents who chose private vaccination paid roughly \u00a3150 for the two\u2011dose course. The programme is expected to cut school and nursery absences and save the UK economy \u00a324\u202fmillion a year, while NHS treatment costs could fall by about \u00a315\u202fmillion annually. Minister of State for Care Stephen Kinnock said the rollout will give parents 'the power to protect' children from the potentially dangerous illness and that it 'puts children\u2019s health first and gives working families the support they deserve.' Amanda Doyle, national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, added that the government will work with GP surgeries and vaccination teams to ensure effective delivery. The decision follows advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and is based on evidence of the burden of severe chickenpox cases. A study by University College London and Keele University found that around three quarters of UK parents supported the introduction of the vaccine into the routine schedule. The government also confirmed that the shingles vaccine will be offered to hundreds of thousands more immunosuppressed adults from next week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[nursinginpractice.com](https://www.nursinginpractice.com/clinical/vaccination-and-infection/chickenpox-vaccine-programme-to-launch-in-january-2026-government-confirms/)\n\n**Kaimur District Launches Stop Diarrhea Campaign**\nThe Health Department of Kaimur district has launched the Stop Diarrhea Campaign to prevent diarrhea in children.

    "summary": "Forecasting experts across diverse domains\u2014including global and public health, biostatistics, epidemiology, and African studies\u2014converge in their view that the Wageningen University/GiveWell-supported study of ORS/zinc distribution in Sierra Leone is highly likely to find a statistically significant increase in usage among recipients (treatment group) compared to controls. Their final probabilities cluster between 65% and 80%, with slight variances depending on disciplinary emphasis.\n\nMajor factors raising probability include: the robust, cluster-randomized RCT design explicitly powered to detect an 8 percentage point usage increase from a 43% baseline; door-to-door delivery by health workers, which is associated with strong uptake in similar interventions; intensive external monitoring and implementation experience of GiveWell and partners; and favorable historical base rates for statistically significant results in analogous trials across Africa and Asia.\n\nThe principal risks moderating optimism are operational: complexity and cognitive load from a multi-component intervention bundle (which can dilute messaging or overwhelm recipients), a non-negligible risk of confusion or misperception between chlorine (prevention) and ORS/zinc (treatment) leading to behavioral substitution, potential delays in completion or reporting (which per resolution criteria would force a No), and the unpredictable responses of remote communities with limited prior health system contact. Intention-to-treat methodological rigor\u2014while reflective of real-world effectiveness\u2014may further dilute observed effects.\n\nGiveWell's own internal forecast of 70% is widely considered reasonable by these experts, though some adjust slightly upward due to strong institutional capacity and monitoring (up to 78\u201380%) or slightly downward (to 65%) out of caution around operational and context-specific challenges.\n\nIn summary, experts agree that, given sound execution and timely reporting, the probability of a statistically significant increase in ORS/zinc usage is high but not guaranteed, with implementation fidelity and effective communication being critical to a Yes outcome.",
