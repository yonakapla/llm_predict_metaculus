Immediate peers (Deutsche Telekom, Siemens) have seen some recent share price weakness, but not of a magnitude likely to drop them below Inditex without a sector-wide or idiosyncratic event. The most plausible path for a Yes is a combination of outperformance by Inditex and a stumble by a peer, but there is little evidence for either in the current data.

Its immediate competitors (Deutsche Telekom, Siemens) have shown recent share price weakness, which narrows the gap and increases the plausibility of Inditex overtaking them. The biggest risk is that broader sector headwinds or a macroeconomic downturn could drag Inditex down as well, or that a late-year recovery in telecoms/industrial stocks re-widens the gap. Based on the current proximity, outperformance, and the possibility of further competitor weakness, I estimate Inditex has a roughly one-third chance of breaking into the top 10 by year-end.

The only firm that has managed to resist is Inditex, whose flagship brand Zara saw a 1.6\u202f% rise in revenue and a 0.8\u202f% rise in profit in the first half of the year, and whose shares are the only ones to have risen in the sector after a recent earnings announcement.  In contrast, luxury brands such as LVMH and Chanel recorded declines of 2\u202f% and 4.3\u202f% in 2024, and the luxury segment\u2019s average revenue growth was a modest 1\u202f%.  The downturn has spread to other segments: Primark\u2019s owner AB\u202fFoods warned that sales would fall 2\u202f% in the last semester, and its shares dropped 10.8\u202f% on the announcement, losing more than 11\u202f% in value over the past year.  H\u202f&M\u2019s first\u2011half sales fell 1\u202f% and profit plunged 27.7\u202f%, with shares down 14.58\u202f% in the last twelve months.  Other multinationals also suffered: Nike \u201312.32\u202f%, Adidas \u201321.03\u202f%, Zalando \u20131.61\u202f%, Lululemon \u201337.36\u202f%, Fast Retailing \u20134.37\u202f%, and Inditex \u201311.81\u202f% in share price, despite a 5.1\u202f% rise in sales.  Spanish fashion spending grew 4.7\u202f% annually between 2020 and 2025, slightly above total consumption growth of 4.3\u202f%, but the gap has narrowed as overall spending now outpaces fashion spending.  Small and medium\u2011sized fashion firms in Spain report flat or declining sales: Acotex\u2019s July sales were flat (0.2\u202f% growth) and August up 1.5\u202f%, while the Catalan fashion cluster recorded a 5.5\u202f% drop in turnover.  Analysts attribute the slowdown to consumers buying less clothing overall, a shift toward ultra\u2011low\u2011cost platforms such as Shein and Temu, and a broader decline in the middle\u2011price segment.  Inditex\u2019s strategy of moving away from the middle price point toward higher\u2011value, trend\u2011oriented products has helped it outperform peers, with Zara\u2019s higher\u2011quality collections and modern store formats supporting a 5.1\u202f% sales increase.

Spanish fashion spending grew 4.7\u202f% annually between 2020 and 2025, slightly above total consumption growth of 4.3\u202f%, but the gap has narrowed as overall spending now outpaces fashion spending.  Small and medium\u2011sized fashion firms in Spain report flat or declining sales: Acotex\u2019s July sales were flat (0.2\u202f% growth) and August up 1.5\u202f%, while the Catalan fashion cluster recorded a 5.5\u202f% drop in turnover.  Analysts attribute the slowdown to consumers buying less clothing overall, a shift toward ultra\u2011low\u2011cost platforms such as Shein and Temu, and a broader decline in the middle\u2011price segment.  Inditex\u2019s strategy of moving away from the middle price point toward higher\u2011value, trend\u2011oriented products has helped it outperform peers, with Zara\u2019s higher\u2011quality collections and modern store formats supporting a 5.1\u202f% sales increase.

It notes that the weight of Spanish firms in the EuroStoxx\u202f50 has fallen from 12.3\u202f% in 2013 to 6.5\u202f% in 2023, and that Spain lost its spot in the Global Top\u202f100 in 2018. The piece lists the current Spanish constituents of the EuroStoxx\u202f50\u2014Inditex, Iberdrola, Santander and BBVA\u2014and highlights that BBVA re\u2011entered the index in 2021 after being excluded in 2020. In the Stoxx\u202f600, 27 Spanish companies are now represented, including Unicaja, Indra, EDP Renov\u00e1veis, Vidrala and Viscofan, a result of the index\u2019s free\u2011float\u2011adjusted capitalization methodology.\n\nThe article also details the MSCI World index, which includes major Spanish names such as Inditex, Santander, Iberdrola, BBVA, CaixaBank, Aena, Ferrovial, Amadeus, Endesa and Telef\u00f3nica. It reports that Naturgy and Acciona Energ\u00eda were dropped from several MSCI indices last year because their free\u2011float was below the required threshold; Naturgy has since raised its free\u2011float to 15.1\u202f% after a 5.5\u202f% accelerated share placement and a 9\u202f% stake acquisition from major shareholders.\n\nFerrovial is positioned to join the Nasdaq\u202f100 this year, having surpassed a market capitalization of $40\u202fbillion for the first time. The company\u2019s potential inclusion depends on the performance of other candidates and current constituents, with investment banks such as JP\u202fMorgan already considering the move for 2025.\n\nFinally, the article lists 16 Spanish firms in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, including Acciona, Aena, Amadeus, Banco Sabadell, Bankinter, CaixaBank, Enag\u00e1s, Endesa, Ferrovial (listed as a Dutch company after its 2023 relocation), Grifols, Iberdrola, Inditex, Indra, Merlin Properties and Redeia, noting that Banco Santander was added in the December 2023 review.\n\nQuotes from the article: 'El peso de las empresas espa\u00f1olas cotizadas en el \u00edndice de referencia europeo EuroStoxx\u202f50 se ha reducido hasta casi la mitad desde 2013, pasado del 12.3\u202f% al 6,5\u202f%.' and 'El peso de las empresas espa\u00f1olas cotizadas en el \u00edndice de referencia europeo EuroStoxx\u202f50 se ha reducido hasta casi la mitad desde 2013, pasado del 12.3\u202f% al 6,5\u202f%.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 12:55 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/13542334/09/25/que-cotizadas-espanolas-se-benefician-de-la-indexacion-internacional-de-los-fondos-y-cuales-persiguen-lograrlo.html)\n\n**Euro\u202fSTOXX\u202f50 Ends Day Slightly Higher**\nOn Thursday, the Euro\u202fSTOXX\u202f50 closed almost unchanged, up 0.09\u202f% at 5,398.18 points, giving the index a market\u2011capitalisation of 4.506\u202fbillion\u202fEuro.

The company has focused its attention on the analysis of the speed at which it starts the year, in a scenario marked by volatility, commercial tensions, and economic uncertainties that seem to have intensified in the first part of 2025. To understand the situation completely, it is essential to analyze the recent economic data, the strategies adopted, the impact of the external environment, as well as the future prospects that are presented to one of the main companies of the Ibex 35 and global fashion. Despite the challenges, Inditex has maintained a strong position in the market, with a capitalization that exceeds 150,000 million euros, and continues to be a reference key in the European and world market. However, its past success, which is often shown as a double-edged sword, generates increasing expectations, which in turn increase the pressure to maintain innovation, speed, and adaptability that have characterized it. The company's history, which has been able to reinvent itself continuously, is now facing new challenges in a more global, changing, and demanding environment. The resilience of its model, the ability to respond to external perturbations, and the adaptation to a market where competition intensifies - with urgency from other global players and new forms of digital and sustainable consumption - will largely determine its course in the coming months. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 10, 2025 05:01 PM\nSource:[america-retail.com](https://america-retail.com/retail-lujo-moda/moda/inditex-en-la-cuerda-floja-velocidad-y-desafio-en-2025/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters from diverse finance, equity research, investment banking, and strategic management backgrounds generally agree that, as of October 2025, Inditex ranks 11th among EU companies by market capitalization and is very close to the 10th spot (primarily held by Deutsche Telekom or Siemens). The gap is modest (~$5 billion), but the base rate for top-10 changes over short periods is low, as large-cap rankings are historically stable. Key positive factors highlighted across most analyses include Inditex\u2019s relative outperformance versus sector peers, company management\u2019s agility, resilience in earnings and profit growth, ongoing strategic investments (notably global expansion and premiumization), and strong shareholder return policies. Conversely, the mass-market apparel sector is described as facing significant headwinds, with slowing consumer demand, competition from ultra-low-cost platforms, negative sector momentum, and macroeconomic weakness\u2014factors that limit substantial share price upside and hamper the possibility of a strong market cap surge. Meanwhile, Inditex\u2019s immediate competitors for the top 10 (especially Deutsche Telekom and Siemens) have recently experienced share price volatility and, in some cases, declines, which increases Inditex\u2019s chances of overtaking them if these trends persist. However, the absence of clear, imminent positive catalysts for Inditex and the inertia of top-10 rankings keep overall probabilities moderate rather than high. Probabilities across experts cluster mostly in the low-to-mid 30% range, with a few estimates as low as 23\u201330%, most commonly 32\u201343%, and only one expert assigning a majority-chance probability (57%) based on Inditex\u2019s sector resilience and the acute weakness of direct competitors. The consensus is that Inditex is \"on the bubble\" for a top-10 finish, with a chance modestly below or around 1-in-3 to just above even, reflecting both the small gap to 10th place and the high degree of uncertainty and volatility among its immediate rivals.",
