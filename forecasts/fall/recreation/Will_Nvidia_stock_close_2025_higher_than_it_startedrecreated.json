Behavioral finance should recognize that the same forces driving window-dressing and herding can abruptly reverse, as institutions rush to lock in gains or adjust to a new narrative (e.g., a negative AI macro headline, or hyperscaler pullback).

However, the behavioral critique highlights the possibility of a sharp late-year correction in crowded trades, and the Portfolio Theory critique is a valid reminder that volatility clustering is a real phenomenon.

AMD, founded in 1969, entered the GPU arena in 2006 by acquiring ATI and has since released a succession of Radeon series, with recent models such as the RX 9070\u202fXT driving strong sales. In the second quarter of 2025, AMD reported revenue of 7.7\u202fbillion\u202fUSD, a 32\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year increase, and a growing data\u2011center segment supported by partnerships with OpenAI, Microsoft and AWS. Analysts project that AMD could reach a 20\u202f% market share in GPUs while already holding 41\u202f% of the server\u2011CPU market.\n\nNvidia, founded in 1999, pioneered the GeForce 256 and has since produced over 15 GPU generations, culminating in the Ada\u2011Lovelace and upcoming Blackwell architectures. Under CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has dominated the AI accelerator market with an estimated 80\u201390\u202f% share, thanks to its vertically integrated hardware, networking and CUDA software stack. In the first quarter of 2025/26, Nvidia\u2019s revenue rose to 44.06\u202fbillion\u202fUSD, a 69.2\u202f% increase from the previous year, and the company invested 2.71\u202fbillion\u202fUSD in the UK to build a robust AI ecosystem.\n\nThe demand for high\u2011performance GPUs and APUs for generative AI has exploded. Nvidia\u2019s proprietary CUDA ecosystem and strong relationships with hyperscalers give it a competitive edge, while AMD counters with an open\u2011source ROCm platform and a focus on mid\u2011tier, server and gaming markets. The article notes that Nvidia\u2019s stock rose over 40\u202f% in September 2025, whereas AMD\u2019s shares dipped slightly, reflecting market tension and investor sentiment.\n\nIn summary, the \"boss\u2011fight\" between AMD and Nvidia is driven by differing strategies: Nvidia relies on vertical integration and market dominance in high\u2011end and AI segments, whereas AMD pursues flexibility, open software and expansion into gaming, data centers and AI. The outcome will depend on technology, strategy, timing and investor confidence.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 03:03 PM\nSource:[wallstreet:online](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/19943942-pixel-power-prestige-ki-boss-fight-grafik-giganten-amd-nvidia-endlos-game)\n\n**What Makes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) an Investment Bet?**\nMacquarie Asset Management\u2019s \u2018Macquarie Core Equity Fund\u2019 investor letter for Q2\u202f2025 reported the fund\u2019s Institutional Class returned 11.94%, outperforming the S&P\u202f500\u00ae Index\u2019s 10.94% rise.

Broadcom\u2019s recent quarterly results showed robust year\u2011over\u2011year growth and a $10\u202fbillion order of custom AI chips (XPUs) from an unnamed customer, which Citi says strengthens Broadcom\u2019s position. Based on these developments, Citi estimates that NVIDIA\u2019s 2026 GPU sales will be roughly 4\u202f% lower than previously forecast and that competition from Broadcom and Google\u2019s increasingly competitive tensor processing units (TPUs) could reduce NVIDIA\u2019s GPU sales by about $12\u202fbillion in 2026. The firm notes that Broadcom\u2019s faster XPU adoption, driven by Google\u2019s shift to compete with NVIDIA by offering compute capacity to rivals such as Meta, OpenAI, and Oracle, poses a growing threat. While acknowledging NVIDIA\u2019s AI\u2011driven solutions, Citi suggests other AI stocks may offer greater upside potential and lower downside risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The company\u2019s GPUs, originally designed for gaming, now drive machine learning, cryptocurrency mining, and autonomous vehicles, with data\u2011center spending being the primary growth engine. According to IoT Analytics, Nvidia holds a 92\u202f% share of the data\u2011center GPU market. In 2026, the four largest hyperscalers\u2014Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon\u2014are projected to spend $454\u202fbillion on capital expenditures, a 26\u202f% increase, with most of that earmarked for AI. CEO Jensen Huang stated that Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, semiconductors, accelerators, networking gear, and full AI\u2011supercomputers account for 58\u202f% (or more) of data\u2011center infrastructure spending. He also projected total data\u2011center spending of $3\u202ftrillion to $4\u202ftrillion by 2030, implying an addressable market of $1.74\u202ftrillion or more over the next five years.

The article notes that Broadcom\u2019s deal is part of a broader trend of major tech firms\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Meta\u2014developing proprietary processors to cut costs and fine\u2011tune AI performance. HSBC analysts warned that the custom silicon market could grow faster than Nvidia\u2019s general\u2011purpose GPU business by 2026. Nvidia\u2019s stock has been volatile, with 19 moves over 5% in the past year; the recent decline is seen as a market reaction to the news rather than a fundamental shift. The article also references Nvidia\u2019s Q2 earnings beat, a slight miss in data\u2011center revenue, and a Q3 forecast that matched consensus, which disappointed investors expecting a larger beat. A weak forecast from peer Marvell Technology added further pressure. Despite the dip, Nvidia has risen 20.8% year\u2011to\u2011date, trading at $167.10 per share near its 52\u2011week high of $183.16 set in August\u202f2025.

Nvidia has sold millions of GPUs for AI data\u2011centers and reported a 56% revenue growth in Q2 FY\u202f2026 (ending July\u202f27), even without sales in China; it projects about $8\u202fbillion in H2\u202f2025 sales if it can resume sales to that market. Alphabet, a major cloud provider, is heavily investing in AI capacity, with Google Cloud and Google Search (which accounts for over half of Alphabet\u2019s revenue) driving demand for AI\u2011processing power.

Management also projects GAAP gross margins of 71.8\u202f% \u00b1\u202f50\u202fbps in the same quarter, approaching its mid\u201170\u202f% target by FY2026. Loop Capital analyst John Donovan 'projects spending on graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom AI accelerators could reach roughly $2 trillion by 2028', representing 50\u201160\u202f% of global computation\u2011infrastructure spend versus 15\u202f% in 2025. Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPUs, 'launched in the fourth quarter of 2024', are already ramping at the fastest pace in the company\u2019s history and are in demand for sovereign AI projects in the Middle East and Europe. China remains a potential growth catalyst; Nvidia is rumored to be developing a 'B30A' chip based on Blackwell for China, with a '15% revenue\u2011sharing agreement' with the U.S. that could still benefit from robust demand trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 09:45 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Finance reported that the Nasdaq\u2011100 Index ($IUXX) fell 2.5% from recent highs amid growing concerns over AI valuations and potential Federal Reserve commentary. The decline was driven mainly by the Magnificent 7 tech names \u2013 Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META) \u2013 which led the downturn. Investor anxiety was heightened by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments about a potential market bubble and an MIT study showing weak corporate returns from AI investments. The possibility of government intervention in the semiconductor sector, specifically an equity stake in Intel (INTC), also weighed on sentiment. Market participants are rotating out of high\u2011valuation tech shares into defensive sectors ahead of Fed Chair Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium, dragging the broader S&P 500 lower. Analysts view the move as a healthy rotation rather than a prolonged downturn, noting that technology stocks have risen roughly 40% from April lows. Profit\u2011taking, stretched valuations, and seasonal weakness typical of August\u2011September are cited as contributing factors, with expectations that any Fed signals about rate cuts could quickly reverse the negative trend. The article highlights five Nasdaq\u2011100 components that have fallen 10% or more from their year\u2011to\u2011date highs, including ARM, whose sell\u2011off was driven by concerns over its shift from licensing to processor design and disappointing Q1 2026 earnings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 05:52 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

    "summary": "All experts across finance, economics, and investment perspectives assign a high probability that Nvidia will close 2025 above its January starting price of $134.29. Their final probabilities for a 'Yes' resolution range from 85% to 94%. The dominant reasoning is that Nvidia is trading substantially above the threshold (recently ~$168-$176), with continued robust revenue growth (~55-56% YoY), strong profitability, leading AI/data-center market share, and supportive analyst targets ($200\u2013$212). Most consider tail risks from macro shocks, Fed policy, sector rotation, earnings misses, or sudden competitive threats. However, they assess these as unlikely to manifest sharply enough in the remaining ~2.5 months to drop Nvidia below the threshold. Competitive risks from custom silicon and hyperscaler vertical integration are seen as more significant for 2026 and beyond. Short-term behavioral factors (window-dressing, herding), sector-specific momentum, and index flows also provide support. While experts note the risk of volatility or a sudden tech correction, the base rate for a >20%+ drawdown over such a short period, barring systemic crisis, is low. The consensus is an overwhelming probability that Nvidia ends 2025 above $134.29, with only moderate caution due to tech sector history and high valuation. The average forecast probability across perspectives is around 90%.",
