However, the empirical and structural consensus is overwhelming: no plausible scenario exists for ICE to cross 543,000 deportations in FY2025. There is no new evidence or argument from deliberation to suggest a higher risk; if anything, the group consensus, especially the critiques of even minor hedging, makes a case for zero.

He added that another million people have self\u2011deported and that up to 6\u202fmillion people who are staying illegally will be removed either by forced deportation or self\u2011deportation. Hough said that Trump\u2019s deployment of the military to the southern border has cut illegal crossings by over 90\u202fpercent. He also noted that during the Biden administration more than 10\u202fmillion people entered the country illegally. Hough cautioned students on visas to avoid political protests and urged them to follow proper channels for extensions. He said that if an illegal immigrant is arrested they will be handcuffed and sent to a detention facility.

It cites that 332,000 people have been deported so far, and that 92\u202f% of construction firms report hiring difficulties. The piece notes that immigrants comprise nearly 20\u202f% of the workforce, 45\u202f% of farm, fishing and forestry workers, 30\u202f% of construction workers, 24\u202f% of service workers, and a third of home\u2011health aides. It claims that the Biden administration\u2019s immigration surge added $1.2\u202ftrillion to federal coffers and $8.9\u202ftrillion to nominal GDP, but also increased costs for education, health care and housing. The article quotes David Bier of the Cato Institute, who says the U.S. is 35\u202fmillion workers short by the 2030s. It calls for legislation such as Rep. Derrick Van\u202fOrden\u2019s bill to legalize undocumented agricultural workers. The author concludes that the current policy is a \"cruel campaign\" that threatens the economy and moral fabric of the country, and urges a more nuanced, dispassionate message: 'It is time to craft a more nuanced, dispassionate message that recognizes both immigrants' contributions to this country and the need for secure borders.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Las Vegas Sun](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2025/sep/16/mass-deportations-are-creating-a-workforce-crisis/)\n\n**Deportations Break Families with Years of Roots in the US, Report Reveals**\nA report by the Kino Initiative for the Border found that among 278 migrants deported from Mexico to Nogales, Sonora between May and July 2024, 44% had lived in the United States for more than ten years, creating social ruptures that undermine family life and community stability. The study, titled 'Ellos no me dejaron decir adi\u00f3s', also reports that 39.2% of the deportees were separated from a family member\u2014most often a partner or child, many of whom were U.S. citizens. The report states that 57% of the deportees were residing in the United States at the time of their detention, compared with 5% the previous year. It notes that 33% of the deportations began with a local or state law\u2011enforcement detention, and almost half involved ICE directly, usually in public spaces such as streets and courthouses. Sixty percent of the arrests occurred in Arizona, with the remainder from California, Florida, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington. The deportees described overcrowding, medical neglect, exposure to toxic smoke, verbal and physical abuse, and prolonged transfers in degrading conditions, which the report says violate the right to personal integrity and access to basic health services. The report quotes: 'Muchas de estas personas tienen un profundo arraigo en sus comunidades, incluyendo hijos, c\u00f3nyuges y otras personas en Estados Unidos', highlighting the emotional, financial and caregiving difficulties faced by families left behind.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 11:56 PM\nSource:[La Jornada de San Luis](https://lajornadasanluis.com.mx/deportaciones-rompen-familias-con-anos-de-arraigo-en-eu-revela-informe/)\n\n**United States: Cuban Fear of End of Migratory Privilege Under Donald Trump**\nThe article reports on the changing migratory privileges for Cuban nationals in the United States under the Donald\u202fTrump administration. It follows 54\u2011year\u2011old artist Vizca\u00edno, who fled Cuba in 2022 and now lives in Arizona and Miami. Vizca\u00edno explains that he entered the U.S. with an i\u2011220A document, which \"allows entry\" but is not recognized by authorities as legal entry, leaving him in a legal limbo and fearful of arrest. He says, 'Hago menos de todo porque vivo en p\u00e1nico' and asks, 'No entiendo que me digan ilegal. Si soy ilegal, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 me dieron ayuda econ\u00f3mica y un n\u00famero de seguridad social cuando entr\u00e9?'. The article cites data from the Miami\u202fHerald that in 2025 ICE detains about 500 irregular Cubans per month, up from nearly 150 in 2024, and that 863 Cubans were deported in 2025. It also notes that the Obama administration ended the \"dry\u2011feet, wet\u2011feet\" policy in 2017, and that the Trump administration\u2019s high deportation targets have intensified enforcement. Professor Michael\u202fJ.\u202fBustamante and attorney Wilfredo\u202fAllen comment that the special pathways enjoyed by Cubans since the Cold War are eroding, and that ICE has never before detained Cubans with i\u2011220A at immigration courts.

Experts countered the narrative, noting that the 2024 average of 4.27 deportation flights per day (including weekends) and 508 flights to Guatemala that year represent \u2018just under an average of 10 flights per week.\u2019 They also highlighted that the 2024 cargo\u2011plane flight carried 75\u201180 people, \u2018lower than the average of 125\u2019 on ICE deportation flights to Guatemala.

At least 122 of those arrests occurred in Illinois, including at least 53 in Chicago itself.  Of the 393 individuals, 32 were apprehended for criminal offenses and 21 for alleged immigration violations.  The data show that 219 of the 393 people had a \u2018departed date\u2019 and \u2018departure country\u2019 listed, indicating they have been deported; the leading destination was Mexico (119 people), followed by Guatemala (24) and Honduras (22), with 15 other countries represented.  The records lack personal identifiers such as names, birth dates, and street addresses for many arrests, which the article notes hampers accountability.  ICE has repeatedly cited the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to justify redactions, yet the agency has issued press releases naming detainees in other contexts.  Block\u202fClub sued ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for FOIA violations after a prolonged lack of response; the lawsuit was filed in May\u202f2024.  The article quotes ICE\u2019s media contact\u2019s automated response: 'Thank you for your email,' and cites immigration expert Trina Realmuto\u2019s observation that \u2018there is no other way to get them to respond to FOIA requests, and the backlog is getting worse.\u2019  The piece highlights that ICE\u2019s 2024 fiscal year saw 59,300 FOIA requests, with 22,246 pending at year\u2011end, and that the National Immigration Litigation Alliance is working to secure regular data releases.

Sanchez, former chair of the Illinois Restaurant Association and owner of venues such as Moe's Cantina, said he voted for Trump because of a 'law\u2011and\u2011order' stance that targets violent offenders, but he is alarmed by the current wave of deportations of non\u2011violent, hard\u2011working immigrants in Chicago. He told reporters, 'I can't regret supporting law and order,' and added, 'But what they're doing now... is not what the president promised.' Sanchez plans to meet senior White House advisers on Wednesday to push for 'common\u2011sense' reform and to honor Trump\u2019s 2024 Meet the Press pledge to help Dreamers\u2014children brought to the U.S. who are protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2014gain a path to citizenship. He also wants the administration to slow deportations of essential workers. Central to his campaign is the bipartisan Dignity Act, sponsored by Reps.

According to Guatemalan financial analyst Jahir Dabroy, migrants \u2018when they perceive a high probability of deportation, as is happening now, they try to send any non\u2011banked cash to their families as quickly as possible\u2019.  The impact of deportations is reflected not only at borders but also in the flow of money back home.  In Central America, family remittances grew 20\u202f% in the first half of 2025.  In Colombia, remittances reached $1.158\u202fmillion in July 2025, a 15.1\u202f% increase over the previous year, according to the Central Bank.  In Honduras and Nicaragua, remittance inflows represent up to a quarter of each country\u2019s national economy.

The figure includes the last three and a half months of the Biden administration, but the bulk of the removals occurred under President Trump, who has roughly doubled the deportation pace compared to his predecessor. The agency\u2019s latest count on Sept. 6 shows 58,766 migrants in detention, down from an all\u2011time high of over 61,000 on Aug. 23. ICE is arresting about 920 people a day, a rate that has been steady since late July; it peaked at nearly 1,200 a day in early June during a high\u2011profile immigration arrest push in Los Angeles. Of those detained, 35% have criminal convictions and 30% have pending charges, a decline from over 40% in May, indicating a shift toward targeting migrants without criminal records. In the latter part of the Biden era, more than 90% of ICE arrests in detention had criminal records. The average daily deportation rate last year was about 740, while under Trump it averages 1,350, which, if sustained, would project roughly 335,000 deportations by the fiscal year\u2019s end. The all\u2011time record of 410,000 deportations was set in 2012 under President Obama.

This places the administration on track to record the highest number of expulsions in a decade, a sharp reversal of the Biden era.  ICE\u2019s total deportations for the first seven months of Trump\u2019s second term are close to 350,000, combining ICE, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Coast Guard actions and voluntary departures.  CBP alone has logged more than 132,000 expulsions, with an additional 17,500 voluntary returns, bringing the combined total to nearly 350,000.  If the current pace continues, the fiscal year 2025 could end with over 300,000 deportations, the highest level since the Obama administration\u2019s 2014 peak of about 316,000.\n\nICE officials say the intensified operations are restoring border control and removing those who are not entitled to stay in the country.  A spokesperson for ICE stated, 'Estamos recuperando el control de nuestras fronteras y devolviendo a quienes no tienen derecho a estar en este pa\u00eds.'  The surge has been felt in major immigrant\u2011dense cities such as Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Houston, where community groups report widespread fear and families avoiding public institutions.\n\nMaria Hern\u00e1ndez, an activist with the Coalition for Immigrant Rights in Florida, warned that the policy is separating families and hurting the local economy: 'Estamos viendo padres detenidos cuando llevan a sus hijos al colegio, o trabajadores arrestados en sus centros de empleo.

According to numbers released on July 26, ICE has deported 246,287 people since the beginning of the fiscal year, an increase from 228,282 cases recorded on July 12, which translates to 1,286 daily deportations, as reported by the Washington Times. If this rate continues, the total number of deportations could exceed 470,000 by the end of the year, surpassing the record set in 2012 under President Barack Obama, which was around 420,000 deportations. Despite the increase in deportations, the number of daily arrests has decreased to less than 900, indicating challenges in implementing Trump's goal of deporting millions who entered the country during the 'border chaos' under former President Joe Biden. The agency is facing legal challenges in this context, with a judge in Los Angeles ruling last month that some of the security campaigns conducted by ICE in June were unconstitutional, and a judge in Washington blocking the use of expedited deportation procedures against migrants who entered the country with a 'conditional release' permit issued by the Biden administration. Currently, ICE is holding 56,945 people, a slightly lower number than the peak of 57,861 in June, but significantly higher than last year's numbers, which ranged from 30,000 to 40,000 detainees. The budget approved by Trump includes funding to significantly expand the agency's detention and deportation capabilities, which could lead to increased numbers in the coming months as the agency escalates its activities. 'We are seeing a significant increase in deportations, and it's a clear indication of the Trump administration's efforts to step up deportation efforts,' said an ICE spokesperson, as reported by the Washington Times. 'We are committed to enforcing our immigration laws and protecting national security.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 05:18 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/8/1/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A8-1300-%D8%B4%D8%AE%D8%B5-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89/7074656)\n\n**Trump Team Pushing 'Utter Propaganda' on Deportations to Create 'Climate of Fear': Experts**\nTrump\u2019s administration announced a mass deportation operation that began the day after his inauguration. The White House posted on social media that \u2018Deportation Flights Have Begun.\u2019 According to the article, ICE arrested 538 undocumented immigrants on Thursday, while a former Capitol Hill staffer noted that Biden\u2019s average arrests were often higher. Experts countered the narrative, noting that the 2024 average of 4.27 deportation flights per day (including weekends) and 508 flights to Guatemala that year represent \u2018just under an average of 10 flights per week.\u2019 They also highlighted that the 2024 cargo\u2011plane flight carried 75\u201180 people, \u2018lower than the average of 125\u2019 on ICE deportation flights to Guatemala. The article quotes an expert saying, \u2018The only thing new about this is subjecting people to transport on a cargo plane rather than charter and the LOWER number of people on the plane \u2013 75\u201180 compared to the average for ICE deportation flights to Guatemala of 125.\u2019 The piece also reports that the Trump administration\u2019s social\u2011media push is intended to create a \u2018climate of fear\u2019 and that experts view it as propaganda.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 06:38 PM\nSource:[thenewcivilrightsmovement.com](https://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2025/01/trump-team-pushing-utter-propaganda-on-deportations-to-create-climate-of-fear-experts/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts\u2014across immigration law, public administration, political science, sociology, and Latin American migration studies\u2014converge on an extremely low probability (ranging from 1% to 3%) that U.S. ICE will deport at least twice as many people in Fiscal Year 2025 as in Fiscal Year 2024. Their analyses emphasize several consistent factors that sharply limit the plausibility of a year-over-year doubling from the already-high 2024 baseline of 271,484 removals: 1) No historical precedent exists for such a surge; the all-time annual record is about 410,000 (Obama era), far short of the needed 542,968 threshold. 2) Operational, bureaucratic, and logistical constraints\u2014such as detention bed space, transport capacity, court case backlogs, local/state cooperation, and ICE workforce limits\u2014make a doubling in a single year logistically implausible even with increased funding and political will. 3) Legal and judicial barriers are active and significant; ongoing and new court rulings are blocking or slowing elements of the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation strategy, especially for broad or expedited removals. 4) While voluntary departures and self-removals are increasing, they typically are not fully counted toward ICE\u2019s official removal statistics, and the magnitude is not enough to bridge the gap. 5) Political and economic backlash, including from business and local leaders (even among Trump\u2019s base), is already constraining enforcement and may intensify with further attempts to ramp up removals. 6) News reporting and ICE data for FY2025 project total removals in the 320,000\u2013475,000 range\u2014an increase over 2024, possibly a record in recent years, but well below the required threshold. Experts also note that only the emergence of extraordinary, presently unforeseeable developments\u2014like sweeping favorable court decisions, legislative changes enabling mass removals, and unprecedented resource mobilization\u2014could make doubling possible, but see no current evidence of such a scenario. In summary, the expert consensus is that although deportations will likely rise again in FY2025, a literal doubling relative to FY2024 is extraordinarily unlikely.",
