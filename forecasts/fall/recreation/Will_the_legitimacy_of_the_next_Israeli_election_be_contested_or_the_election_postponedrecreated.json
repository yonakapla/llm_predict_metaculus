The news shows ongoing elite attempts to manipulate the system and widespread fears of illiberal drift. Nevertheless, the procedural and institutional obstacles remain formidable, and recent statements by former ministers and opposition figures reinforce the difficulty of achieving the necessary supermajority for postponement. The President and Supreme Court remain cautious, aware of the international attention. Therefore, while the risk is nontrivial and higher than in past cycles, the most likely outcome is that the election will proceed, possibly early, and while its legitimacy may be heatedly debated, the specific, formal thresholds for this question are unlikely to be met.

The most plausible upward adjustment would be in response to the war context; however, the lack of precedent for crossing these lines in prior crises, and the continued resilience of institutional actors, mean my estimate remains in the upper teens. I do not find sufficient reason to move above 20%, but I acknowledge that a 1\u20133 point upward revision would be justified by the current volatility and the convergence of risks. Therefore, I modestly revise my forecast upward.",

The arguments that the three resolution paths are not truly independent, and that even severe crises in the past have not met these thresholds, reinforce my initial structural skepticism. While some assign slightly higher probabilities (in the low 20s) to reflect the elevated risk environment, the weight of comparative, legal, and empirical evidence still supports a sub-20% risk estimate.

The 80-MK threshold for postponement, the Supreme Court's historical restraint, and the President's extreme caution are not just technicalities; they are substantive, time-tested brakes on institutional breakdown. Critiques focused on the risk of letting global trends in democratic backsliding and local rhetorical escalation outweigh the actual probability of elite coordination necessary to trigger any of the strict resolution criteria. While the present context justifies a significant rise from the historical base rate, the best estimates from the most structurally grounded analyses are in the 16\u201320% range.

After the 2021 election, the outgoing prime minister claimed it was the result of \"the greatest election fraud,\" despite official bodies finding no evidence of major irregularities. Such rhetoric has been matched by actions critics see as intimidating voters. In 2019, the Likud party deployed monitors with hidden cameras to polling stations in Arab communities and later unsuccessfully pushed for legislation to allow party-affiliated cameras, citing unsubstantiated fraud claims. Central to these concerns is the battle over the judiciary. Opponents argue the government's effort to control judicial appointments is meant to weaken the only institution that can rule on election disputes. Together, these elements raise fears that the election's legitimacy could be challenged.",

At least one Supreme Court justice supports nullification of the vote.\n   - This criterion is met if a formal appeal against the nationwide election results is adjudicated by the Israeli Supreme Court, and in the final published ruling on the matter, at least one sitting justice expresses support for the nullification of the nationwide results.\n   - This support can be expressed in a majority, concurring, or dissenting opinion.\n   - \"Nullification\" is defined as invalidating the election's outcome at a national level, which would be sufficient to require a new election or a fundamental change in the final allocation of Knesset seats. The nullification of results from a single or small number of ballot boxes will not be sufficient to meet this criterion.\n   - Resolution Source: The official published text of the Supreme Court's ruling on the election appeal.\n\n2. The President publicly expresses concern on the legitimacy of the vote.\n   - This criterion is met if, in the period between Election Day and 30 days after the official publication of final results in Reshumot, the sitting President of Israel makes a public statement that explicitly questions the overall legitimacy of the election results.\n   - A \"public statement\" is defined as an official televised address, a formal press release from the President's Residence, or an on-the-record quote to the media reported by at least two major Israeli news outlets (e.g., Kan, Haaretz, Ynet, The Times of Israel).\n   - The statement must contain language semantically equivalent to declaring the results \"illegitimate,\" \"fraudulent,\" \"deeply flawed,\" or stating that they \"do not reflect the true will of the people.\" Vague calls for unity, transparency, or for all votes to be counted fairly will not be sufficient.\n   - Resolution Source: Official transcripts or credible, widespread media reporting of the statement.\n\n3. The election is postponed or cancelled for any reason.\n   - This criterion is met if a date is officially set for the election (either by law for the 2026 date or by the Knesset for an early election) and it is subsequently postponed or cancelled by a formal Knesset law or government decision.\n   - This applies for any reason given, with no exceptions.\n   - Resolution Source: The official text of the law or government decree postponing the election."

Inside the country, the opposition Bloc patriotique secured 49,54\u202f% of the vote, compared with 44,13\u202f% for the PDS.  The PDS received more than 85\u202f% of the vote in several Western countries, while in Russia only two polling stations were opened, preventing thousands of Moldovan expatriates from voting.

Galant criticized the decision, saying it concerns the future of Likud as a whole and questioning whether the party is following the approaches of Menachem Begin or Ehud Barak. He stated, 'The claim that anyone who expresses an opinion should be expelled from the party is offensive and unacceptable.' He added that the party\u2019s 140,000 members have the right to determine its future through primary elections, not a group of twenty.

The statement alleges that the PDS secured a new parliamentary majority through \"manipulation, exploitation of fears and the destruction of any political competition,\" and that police intimidation, threats of fines, and checks continued on the day of voting.  It also claims that President Maia\u202fSandu\u2019s open intervention \"irreversibly compromised the electoral process,\" with the Central Election Commission, judiciary, Information and Security Service (SIB) and Ministry of Internal Affairs acting in concert to \"sterilise\" the political field.  Election results show that 99.65\u202f% of precinct protocols were processed, and five parties entered parliament: the PDS with 54 seats, the opposition with 47 seats, and the majority being achieved largely through overseas voting.  The statement further criticises the regime for restricting voting in Transnistria, opening only 12 polling stations for 270,000 residents, allowing only about 12,000 voters to reach a station, and creating artificial traffic jams and physical barriers at Dniester bridges.  Former president Igor\u202fDodon accused the regime of fraud at overseas polling stations, declared that the opposition won domestically, and announced a peaceful protest on 29\u202fSeptember in Chisinau.

He stated, 'I generally support the plan. It is not my source of happiness, but the alternative is worse.' Ramon warned that continuing manoeuvring in Gaza would endanger hostages and erode international support, and that the plan guarantees the immediate release of all hostages. He criticized the ambiguity of Hamas disarmament, noting, 'We did not disarm Hezbollah, but we signed a cease\u2011fire under U.S. supervision.' He suggested that Netanyahu should tell Trump 'yes' to secure international legitimacy to eliminate Hamas. Ramon also said that if Hamas remains in control, international forces could intervene and that the U.S. may halt humanitarian aid. He dismissed the possibility of canceling Israeli elections, saying, 'It will not happen. To postpone elections you need 80 Knesset members, which is impossible.' He criticized leaders such as Netanyahu and Yair Lapid for lack of clarity. The article outlines Trump\u2019s plan: phased Israeli withdrawal, a Hamas\u2011free Gaza government with Arab and Islamic security forces, Arab financing for reconstruction with partial Palestinian participation, and a halt to Israeli presence in the West Bank or Gaza.

According to CEC head Angela\u202fKaraman, by 16:00 Moscow time a total of 1\u202f150\u202f000 voters had participated, exceeding the required threshold of one\u2011third of the electoral roll.  The elections featured 23 competitors \u2013 15 parties, four blocs and four independent candidates \u2013 contesting 101 seats.  To enter parliament independents must surpass a 2\u202f% vote share, parties a 5\u202f% threshold and blocs a 7\u202f% threshold.\n\nKaraman noted that polling stations in Tokyo and Beijing were already closed, while the last stations in the United States and Canada would open at 17:00.  The article reports a series of alleged irregularities abroad: in Austria, Romania, France, Spain and Germany ballot boxes were reportedly overcrowded or observers were denied access; in Italy a polling station was instructed to deliver 87\u202f% of the vote to the ruling Party of the Democratic Socialists (PDSS) with a turnout of at least 79\u202f%.\n\nThe CEC also warned that parents of schoolchildren must send teachers photographs of ballots, and that anonymous offers of 50\u202f\u20ac per vote for the ruling party and 20\u202f\u20ac for each referred voter were circulating.  In July the CEC had said that the Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs would open only two overseas polling stations in Russia, a request that was later expanded to five for the 2024 presidential election but only two were approved.\n\nAfter the 2024 presidential election, former president Maia\u202fSandu lost to former prosecutor Alexander\u202fStoyanoglo, who secured 51\u202f% of the vote.  Sandu was re\u2011elected after the count of more than 300\u202f000 Moldovan migrant workers \u2013 for whom authorities opened over 200 polling stations in the EU and the United States \u2013 was added.  The Constitutional Court upheld the results despite opposition claims of fraud.\n\nA similar pattern emerged in the October\u202f2024 referendum on EU integration: the government\u2019s 50.46\u202f% pro\u2011EU vote was largely driven by diaspora ballots, while only about 46\u202f% of domestic voters supported integration.  The Russian Foreign Minister Maria\u202fZakharova described the referendum and elections as evidence of a \u201cdeep split\u201d in Moldovan society.\n\nThe article also recounts the CEC\u2019s exclusion of the opposition \u201cHeart of Moldova\u201d party from the parliamentary election, the reduction of polling stations in Russia and Transnistria to limit opposition votes, and the expansion of stations in Europe to secure diaspora support.\n\nKey metrics cited:\n- 1\u202f150\u202f000 voters by 16:00 Moscow time (exceeding one\u2011third of registered voters)\n- 23 competitors: 15 parties, 4 blocs, 4 independents\n- 101 parliamentary seats\n- Thresholds: 2\u202f% (independents), 5\u202f% (parties), 7\u202f% (blocs)\n- 87\u202f% vote for PDSS at an Italian station with 79\u202f% turnout\n- 50\u202f\u20ac per vote and 20\u202f\u20ac per referred voter allegations\n- 300\u202f000 migrant workers counted in 2024 presidential election\n- 200+ polling stations in EU/USA for diaspora\n- 50.46\u202f% pro\u2011EU vs 49.54\u202f% anti in referendum; 46\u202f% domestic support\n\nThe report presents these facts and allegations without overt editorializing, citing official statements and media reports.\n\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250928/vybory-2044964754.html)\n\n**King Bibi's profound changes to the Middle East**\nThe article portrays Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, nicknamed \"Mr. Security,\" as a long\u2011serving, controversial leader who has won five elections since first taking office in 1996, making him the longest\u2011serving head of state in Israel\u2019s history. According to the piece, recent polls show only 40% of Israelis trust him, yet he remains a dominant political figure. Critics describe him as a \"ruthless and corrupt danger to democracy,\" while his wife Sara repeatedly says, 'Without Bibi the country is lost.' In 2015 he answered lawmakers, 'I'm asked if we will forever live by the sword: Yes.'\n\nNetanyahu was born in Tel Aviv in 1949 to historian Benzion Netanyahu. The article recounts his military service, the death of his brother Yoni in 1976, and how that event motivated him to pursue a career in public service. He served as Israel\u2019s UN representative in 1984, was elected to the Knesset in 1988, became head of the Likud party in 1993, and first became prime minister in 1996 after defeating Shimon Peres by less than 1 percentage point. He lost the 1999 election, served in Ariel Sharon\u2019s cabinet, resigned in 2005 over the Gaza withdrawal, and was re\u2011elected in 2009.\n\nDuring his tenure, Netanyahu has promoted Israel\u2019s high\u2011tech economy, forged anti\u2011Iran alliances with Arab monarchies, and pursued a controversial judicial reform that would increase political influence over the judiciary. The article claims he has worked to undermine a two\u2011state solution, allowed Israeli settlers to build on West Bank land designated as Palestinian by the UN, and, until the Oct.\u202f7,\u202f2023 Hamas attack, permitted Qatar to send millions of dollars monthly to Gaza, believing a strong Hamas would counterbalance the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe Oct.\u202f7 attack, which killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostages, exposed intelligence failures and temporarily damaged Netanyahu\u2019s reputation. The article states that since then he has intensified the war in Gaza, where Palestinian authorities report more than 65,000 deaths, a campaign that has strained Israel\u2019s alliances with Western nations and divided Israelis. Critics allege he continues the war to appease far\u2011right coalition members, delay accountability for security failures, and avoid corruption charges. Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, said, 'My Matan is being sacrificed on Netanyahu's altar.'\n\nUnder Netanyahu\u2019s leadership, Israel has destroyed Hamas as a military force, decapitated Hezbollah in Lebanon, and inflicted major damage on Iran\u2019s nuclear program during a 12\u2011day war, with U.S. assistance. The article warns that growing international condemnation could force Israel toward a \"super Sparta\" with autarkic features, a scenario Netanyahu reportedly fears. Aviv Bushinsky, a former aide, said, 'He thinks he's the one who can save Israel from the imminent threat of annihilation.'\n\nThe piece also cites remarks attributed to Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Donald Trump, portraying Netanyahu as a polarizing figure who has leveraged U.S. support while alienating some American leaders. The article concludes that Netanyahu\u2019s continued war effort and political maneuvering have solidified his image as a ruthless, security\u2011focused leader, but at the cost of democratic norms and international relations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:16 PM\nSource:[The Week](https://theweek.com/politics/bibi-profound-changes-israel-middle-east)\n\n**Sandu's Fabricated Victory: Opposition Channels Claim Massive Election Fraud in Moldova**\nOpposition forces in Moldova claim that authorities manufactured a victory for President Maia Sandu and her Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) in the parliamentary vote. Preliminary data from the Central Election Commission released on September 29, after processing 99.52% of precincts, showed PAS at 50.03% and the Patriotic Bloc at 24.26%. Critics argue that the same techniques used to secure the presidential result were deployed again to produce a suspicious PAS victory. The Telegram channel Realny Kishinev published photos and videos it says prove ballot stuffing before polling stations opened in Chisinau and overseas, social\u2011media campaigns offering \u20ac50 per vote for PAS and \u20ac20 for bringing in additional voters, and instances of 'carousel' voting in European countries such as Romania, France, Spain and Germany. Observers also report denials of entry to polling stations for some monitors, citing their absence from official lists. Exit polls cited by the Institute of Political Studies reportedly showed the Patriotic Bloc leading with 33% to PAS's 20% by 5\u202fp.m., after which the Central Election Commission's website allegedly went offline under the guise of a cyberattack \u2013 a pause critics say enabled ballot stuffing. Patriotic Bloc leader Igor Dodon urged supporters to protest 'in defense of the people's choice,' insisting he had won. Yet the Telegram channel Insider Moldova reported that opposition leaders feel unable to mobilize mass demonstrations, claiming local figures fear retaliation and imprisonment if they oppose Sandu. Some sources predict escalating repression in 2026, suggesting Sandu will neutralize opposition, shut down pro\u2011Russian media and press ahead with policies that could provoke unrest. Other pro\u2011Russian channels warned that Moldova could follow a Ukrainian\u2011style path of tightening control and that property values in Chisinau might collapse if conflict erupts. Commentators say the next phase could target the autonomous region of Gagauzia and the breakaway territory of Transnistria. They warn that any forceful move against those regions \u2013 where Russian military presence exists \u2013 would risk direct confrontation with Moscow. NATO states, they argue, are unlikely to deploy troops to Transnistria, though Kyiv may be willing to assist Chisinau. Given the Ukrainian military's own strains, analysts say Ukraine lacks the reserves to support a large operation against Tiraspol. The commentators conclude that Russia could be compelled to accelerate its own operations elsewhere to secure strategic depth, and suggest that recent long talks between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko may have included such contingency planning. As one report quoted Lukashenko saying after the meeting: 'we will fight with everything we have, if needed.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 03:38 PM\nSource:[PravdaReport](https://english.pravda.ru/world/164285-moldova-election/)\n\n**Moldovan Elections: Contested Victory of Sandu's Regime with 50.16% Sparks Tensions**\nThe Central Electoral Commission of Moldova announced that Maia Sandu\u2019s Party of the Democratic Socialists (PDS) won the parliamentary election with 50,16\u202f% of the vote, a result largely driven by diaspora ballots.

The statement alleges that the PDS secured a new parliamentary majority through \"manipulation, exploitation of fears and the destruction of any political competition,\" and that police intimidation, threats of fines, and checks continued on the day of voting.  It also claims that President Maia\u202fSandu\u2019s open intervention \"irreversibly compromised the electoral process,\" with the Central Election Commission, judiciary, Information and Security Service (SIB) and Ministry of Internal Affairs acting in concert to \"sterilise\" the political field.  Election results show that 99.65\u202f% of precinct protocols were processed, and five parties entered parliament: the PDS with 54 seats, the opposition with 47 seats, and the majority being achieved largely through overseas voting.  The statement further criticises the regime for restricting voting in Transnistria, opening only 12 polling stations for 270,000 residents, allowing only about 12,000 voters to reach a station, and creating artificial traffic jams and physical barriers at Dniester bridges.  Former president Igor\u202fDodon accused the regime of fraud at overseas polling stations, declared that the opposition won domestically, and announced a peaceful protest on 29\u202fSeptember in Chisinau.

The ruling party, \"Action and Solidarity,\" is said to hold more than 40\u202f% of the vote, while the opposition Patriotic Bloc is around 30\u202f%.

It also notes that about 120 observers from 50 countries were denied access to polling stations, a move that the Moldovan government rejected.

He stated, 'I generally support the plan. It is not my source of happiness, but the alternative is worse.' Ramon warned that continuing manoeuvring in Gaza would endanger hostages and erode international support, and that the plan guarantees the immediate release of all hostages. He criticized the ambiguity of Hamas disarmament, noting, 'We did not disarm Hezbollah, but we signed a cease\u2011fire under U.S. supervision.' He suggested that Netanyahu should tell Trump 'yes' to secure international legitimacy to eliminate Hamas. Ramon also said that if Hamas remains in control, international forces could intervene and that the U.S. may halt humanitarian aid. He dismissed the possibility of canceling Israeli elections, saying, 'It will not happen. To postpone elections you need 80 Knesset members, which is impossible.' He criticized leaders such as Netanyahu and Yair Lapid for lack of clarity. The article outlines Trump\u2019s plan: phased Israeli withdrawal, a Hamas\u2011free Gaza government with Arab and Islamic security forces, Arab financing for reconstruction with partial Palestinian participation, and a halt to Israeli presence in the West Bank or Gaza. Trump will meet Netanyahu on Monday at the White House to discuss the plan, while Israel seeks to amend some concessions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 04:56 PM\nSource:[LebanonDebate](https://www.lebanondebate.com/article/747025-%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AE%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84)\n\n**Moldovan CEC Says Parliamentary Elections Can Be Declared Valid**\nThe Moldovan Central Electoral Commission (CEC) announced that the parliamentary elections held on 28 September 2025 can be considered valid because more than one\u2011third of the registered voters cast ballots.  According to CEC head Angela\u202fKaraman, by 16:00 Moscow time a total of 1\u202f150\u202f000 voters had participated, exceeding the required threshold of one\u2011third of the electoral roll.  The elections featured 23 competitors \u2013 15 parties, four blocs and four independent candidates \u2013 contesting 101 seats.  To enter parliament independents must surpass a 2\u202f% vote share, parties a 5\u202f% threshold and blocs a 7\u202f% threshold.\n\nKaraman noted that polling stations in Tokyo and Beijing were already closed, while the last stations in the United States and Canada would open at 17:00.  The article reports a series of alleged irregularities abroad: in Austria, Romania, France, Spain and Germany ballot boxes were reportedly overcrowded or observers were denied access; in Italy a polling station was instructed to deliver 87\u202f% of the vote to the ruling Party of the Democratic Socialists (PDSS) with a turnout of at least 79\u202f%.\n\nThe CEC also warned that parents of schoolchildren must send teachers photographs of ballots, and that anonymous offers of 50\u202f\u20ac per vote for the ruling party and 20\u202f\u20ac for each referred voter were circulating.  In July the CEC had said that the Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs would open only two overseas polling stations in Russia, a request that was later expanded to five for the 2024 presidential election but only two were approved.\n\nAfter the 2024 presidential election, former president Maia\u202fSandu lost to former prosecutor Alexander\u202fStoyanoglo, who secured 51\u202f% of the vote.  Sandu was re\u2011elected after the count of more than 300\u202f000 Moldovan migrant workers \u2013 for whom authorities opened over 200 polling stations in the EU and the United States \u2013 was added.  The Constitutional Court upheld the results despite opposition claims of fraud.\n\nA similar pattern emerged in the October\u202f2024 referendum on EU integration: the government\u2019s 50.46\u202f% pro\u2011EU vote was largely driven by diaspora ballots, while only about 46\u202f% of domestic voters supported integration.  The Russian Foreign Minister Maria\u202fZakharova described the referendum and elections as evidence of a \u201cdeep split\u201d in Moldovan society.\n\nThe article also recounts the CEC\u2019s exclusion of the opposition \u201cHeart of Moldova\u201d party from the parliamentary election, the reduction of polling stations in Russia and Transnistria to limit opposition votes, and the expansion of stations in Europe to secure diaspora support.\n\nKey metrics cited:\n- 1\u202f150\u202f000 voters by 16:00 Moscow time (exceeding one\u2011third of registered voters)\n- 23 competitors: 15 parties, 4 blocs, 4 independents\n- 101 parliamentary seats\n- Thresholds: 2\u202f% (independents), 5\u202f% (parties), 7\u202f% (blocs)\n- 87\u202f% vote for PDSS at an Italian station with 79\u202f% turnout\n- 50\u202f\u20ac per vote and 20\u202f\u20ac per referred voter allegations\n- 300\u202f000 migrant workers counted in 2024 presidential election\n- 200+ polling stations in EU/USA for diaspora\n- 50.46\u202f% pro\u2011EU vs 49.54\u202f% anti in referendum; 46\u202f% domestic support\n\nThe report presents these facts and allegations without overt editorializing, citing official statements and media reports.\n\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250928/vybory-2044964754.html)\n\n**Controlling Islamic-lobby OIC&#x2019;s Cowardly UN Walkout: An Affront to Truth, Peace, and Israel&#x2019;s Moral Clarity**\nDuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address at the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) staged a walkout that the author describes as a 'blatant act of intellectual cowardice' and a 'disgraceful betrayal' of the UN's core principles. The piece argues that Israel, the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, consistently advocates for peace, coexistence, and the right to self\u2011defence, while OIC nations choose 'petulance over dialogue' and refuse to hear the truth. The author claims the walkout was not a protest but a denial of Israel's legitimacy and moral clarity, stating 'Let's be clear: this shameful display was not about policy disagreements or political nuance.' The article concludes that the OIC's action 'walked out on diplomacy, accountability, and the future of peace itself.' The piece is sourced from Donald J.

It claims that Israeli governments, both left\u2011 and right\u2011wing, have expanded settlements in the West Bank for decades to block the creation of a Palestinian state, a strategy that has been quietly maintained despite international pressure. The piece states that \"Fast alle Mitglieder der amtierenden israelischen Regierung lehnen einen pal\u00e4stinensischen Staat entschieden ab\" and that the current government would \"gern das komplette Westjordanland annektieren\" if it could. It further contends that the Likud party\u2019s rise is tied to a growing ultra\u2011orthodox base and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s longevity is due to this support. The article accuses Western governments of hypocrisy, noting that they have \"pl\u00f6tzlich einen Pal\u00e4stinenserstaat ohne Vorbedingungen\" recognized, which the author calls a potential Pyrrhic victory. It concludes that Israel\u2019s foreign policy is now dominated by radical elements and that the international community has largely ignored the radicalization on both sides of the conflict.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 07:35 AM\nSource:[juedische-allgemeine.de](https://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/israel/israels-scheinheilige-kritik-an-macron-und-starmer/)\n\n**Israeli Concerns Over Netanyahu\u2019s Attempt to Delay Elections by Attacking Iran**\nThe article reports a growing controversy in Israel over the integrity of the upcoming Knesset elections, which are scheduled for October 2023. It alleges that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking to postpone the elections by citing security reasons such as launching an attack on Iran. The article cites former Prime Minister Neftali Benet, who has announced that elections will not be postponed, saying \u2018\u0644\u0646 \u0646\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0644\u0623\u064a \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0628\u062a\u0623\u062c\u064a\u0644 \u0623\u0648 \u062a\u0639\u0637\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062a\u2019 and warning security officials not to \u2018\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0641\u0642\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062e\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0628\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0636\u063a\u0637 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a\u2019.  It also quotes political analyst Yossi Vetter, who warns that the opposition led by Benet faces difficulties in winning the elections and that the ruling coalition has attempted to undermine electoral integrity through legislative proposals, including a law that would prevent those who support the BDS boycott from running and a law that would allow the Supreme Court to remove the central electoral committee\u2019s authority.  The article claims that Netanyahu has considered attacking Iranian nuclear sites following Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 attack on Gaza, and that he received approval from former U.S. President Donald Trump in June 2024 to accelerate preparations for an attack on Iran.  It further mentions a failed assassination attempt on a Hamas negotiator in Qatar and the subsequent judicial crackdown.  Vetter is quoted as saying the rhetoric about postponing elections has become \u201clike a pandemic\u201d in liberal circles, and that the opposition\u2019s statements are a natural reaction to the \u201ccriminal and mafia-like\u201d conduct of the governing coalition.  The article notes that the law to postpone elections would require an 80\u2011member majority in the Knesset, while a 61\u2011member majority is needed for certain other legislative changes.  The piece concludes that the political climate is highly charged, with the opposition warning that the ruling coalition\u2019s attempts to manipulate the judiciary and the electoral process will ultimately fail.

It warns that, amid a decline in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s popularity, the liberal camp fears he may resort to intimidation tactics to influence the electoral process. According to a report by the Hebrew newspaper Haaretz, Netanyahu could cancel or postpone the vote \"until after the war,\" launch propaganda campaigns against opponents, and, if defeated, refuse to accept the results with the backing of far\u2011right National Security Minister Yitzhak Ben\u2011Gvir and security agencies. Polls suggest his coalition may lose, yet the paper argues he has two advantages: a divided opposition that includes hard\u2011right figures who do not oppose the war or evacuation policies, and the dominance of security issues in public discourse, which traditionally benefits Likud. Despite being held responsible for the 7\u202fOctober disaster and abandoning Gaza prisoners, Netanyahu has portrayed his ongoing trial as a witch hunt, downplayed democratic safeguards, and leveraged relatively positive economic indicators such as falling unemployment, a stable currency, and steady housing prices. Economists warn that this \"dangerous illusion\" could collapse under war costs and international isolation. The article concludes that the threat is not only electoral manipulation but also the possibility of a new Netanyahu victory, which would legitimize dismantling liberal institutions and steering Israel toward an authoritarian state, drawing parallels with Donald Trump\u2019s return to power in the United States. Analysts call for a unified opposition, a comprehensive electoral vision, and trustworthy leadership to exploit Netanyahu\u2019s weaknesses\u2014his corruption, religious alignment, and role in brain\u2011drain\u2014otherwise he could again surprise opponents with a decisive electoral announcement, earning him the \"big prize\".\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 02, 2025 05:13 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_publicaffairs/details/2025/9/2/2847451/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B2-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A9-)\n\n**Israel's Election Law Change: A Threat to Arab Parties?**\nThe Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is considering a critical change to the election law, which could target Arab parties. In the 2019 elections, the Likud Party had installed 1,200 secret cameras in polling stations in Arab areas, claiming it was to 'monitor the integrity of the elections.' However, Balad party leader Jamal Zahalka said this move was intended to intimidate voters and prevent them from casting their ballots. A strategy firm working with Likud reported that Arab voter turnout had dropped by half. Now, similar or even more extensive interventions are being discussed ahead of the elections, which are expected to take place within 14 months. The Israel Democracy Institute notes that while past elections have generally been clean, concerns are growing due to increasing polarization, populism, and declining public trust in the electoral process. A proposed law change, submitted by Likud coalition chairman Ofir Katz, would allow Arab candidates to be disqualified from running if they are deemed to be supporting terrorism, even if they do not directly support it. Additionally, candidates could be removed from the ballot without the approval of the Supreme Court. Analysts say this move is aimed at either banning or rendering Arab parties ineffective. Other proposed laws would bar supporters of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement from running for office, further eroding trust in the electoral process. Social media campaigns, including fake accounts and manipulated content targeting Arab voters, are also being used to discourage participation. The influence of far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on the police, particularly in Arab areas, could also deter voters. The potential for violence in Arab communities could also reduce turnout. Even a 10-15% drop in Arab voter turnout could give the right-wing parties an additional seat in the parliament.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: August 12, 2025 09:38 AM\nSource:[Cumhuriyet](https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/dunya/israil-de-secim-yasasinda-kritik-degisiklik-hedef-arap-partiler-mi-2425780)\n\n**Denunciation of Statistical Fraud in 2025 Judicial Election**\nThe 2025 judicial election to appoint ministers to the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) was marred by irregularities that experts have called a statistical, technical, and structural fraud. A report by retired Minister Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Coss\u00edo and lawyer Jorge Medell\u00edn revealed that nine candidates won in block in over 16,400 polling stations, a mathematically improbable pattern that suggests deliberate manipulation. The investigation showed that 'accordion' lists were distributed from May to induce voting towards those profiles, and that over 20% of polling stations presented suspicious coincidences, a threshold that the law establishes as a cause for annulling the election. According to statistical analysis, the homogeneous vote in favor of the same nine candidates, all linked to the 4T political current, cannot be explained by a competitive or democratic election, but rather by a premeditated operation that simulates a legitimate electoral process. This pattern was repeated in multiple entities, with states like Aguascalientes and Quintana Roo reaching joint voting percentages of up to 97%. Additionally, there was minimal voter participation, uncontrolled spending, and almost absolute control over the results. Despite the controversy, the National Electoral Institute (INE) imposed fines of around 18 million pesos for detected irregularities, mainly for the dissemination and use of 'acordeones', documents that guided voting towards the favored candidates. However, the winners remain in their positions, a situation that has generated criticism for normalizing and validating a disputed electoral process. The election aimed to renew nine members of the highest court, but the methodology and results have been questioned by various political and social sectors, who demand a thorough review and the annulment of the process due to the gravity of the possible fraud. This case represents a challenge to the credibility of the judicial and electoral system, as well as to citizens' trust in democratic institutions in Mexico.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 07:21 PM\nSource:[Revista Punto de Vista](https://revistapuntodevista.com.mx/seccion/mexico/denuncian-fraude-estadistico-en-eleccion-judicial-2025/885450/)\n\n**Israeli Tribunal Postpones Netanyahu's Testimony in Corruption Trial Amid US Pressure**\nAn Israeli tribunal has postponed the testimony of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his corruption trial, following a request supported by former US President Donald Trump, who called the process a 'political witch hunt'. Netanyahu is facing charges of accepting luxury gifts and media manipulation, while his government is pushing for controversial judicial reforms amidst regional tensions and negotiations with Hamas. Trump described Netanyahu as a 'war hero' and a leader who achieved significant advancements with the US, particularly in eliminating the Iranian nuclear threat. He also questioned the legitimacy of the trial, calling it a 'political witch hunt' similar to the one he faced. The tribunal initially rejected the request to postpone the trial, but later accepted it after hearing arguments from Netanyahu, the head of military intelligence, and the head of the Mossad spy agency. Netanyahu's lawyers had requested the postponement to allow the prime minister to focus on security issues following the ceasefire with Iran and ongoing battles in Gaza, where Israeli hostages are being held. 'After the explanations presented... we accepted partially the request and cancelled the hearings of Mr. Netanyahu scheduled for this week,' declared the Jerusalem District Court in its ruling, published online by the Likud party. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, criticized Trump, saying he 'should not interfere in a judicial trial in an independent country.' Netanyahu has denied all charges against him, while his supporters claim the lengthy trial has political motivations. He and his wife, Sara, are accused of receiving luxury gifts worth over $260,000 from millionaires in exchange for political favors. In two additional cases, Netanyahu is accused of attempting to influence media coverage for two Israeli media outlets.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/es/medio-oriente/20250629-tribunal-israel%C3%AD-retrasa-comparecencia-de-netanyahu-en-juicio-por-corrupci%C3%B3n-ante-la-presi%C3%B3n-estadounidense)\n\n**Netanyahu Considers Early Elections to Strengthen Likud Party**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering calling early elections to strengthen his Likud party in the parliament and reduce his dependence on his ultra-orthodox allies. The decision comes after the successful attack on Iran's nuclear power, which has boosted his popularity. Netanyahu wants to capitalize on the current momentum to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia and prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. However, he faces opposition from his ultra-orthodox allies, who are threatening to leave the government if he pushes forward with a law that obliges ultra-orthodox students to enlist in the army. Netanyahu is seeking to negotiate quotas for exemptions and light sanctions for deserters. He also faces challenges in the parliament to approve the next year's budget and the financial burdens of war. According to a recent poll, the Likud would gain 27 seats in the parliament, but Netanyahu would still need to form a new coalition. 'It's true that Netanyahu's popularity has increased in the context of the war, something that we observe with concern. The dynamics of conflict often consolidate leaderships from the logic of fear and not from a shared vision of the future,' said Dar\u00edo Teitelbaum, secretary general of the World Union of Meretz, the traditional Israeli left-wing party.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 06:55 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/internacional/2025/06/24/benjamin-netanyahu-analiza-convocar-a-elecciones-anticipadas-en-israel-tras-el-anuncio-del-cese-el-fuego/)\n\n**Elegir jueces es democracia**\nThe Organization of American States (OEA) has expressed concerns about the low participation rate of 13% in the recent election of the Poder Judicial. However, this figure cannot be seen as a failure. The election was an unprecedented exercise in Mexico, requiring a learning curve. It is not the same to choose a President or deputies as it is to choose judges; citizens need time, information, and civic education to appropriate this right. As in any democracy, new mechanisms require pedagogy, not disqualification. Furthermore, the reduced participation does not invalidate the legality or legitimacy of the process, which was carried out peacefully, transparently, and without incidents. The OEA also warned about the 'polarized context' in which the election took place. This criticism is inconsistent, as democracy should not be delayed due to the political climate. If so, no country with intense debates could advance in any reform. Polarization is not synonymous with instability, but with democratic discussion. The election of the Poder Judicial aimed to open the doors to an institution historically closed, dominated by elite interests, and allow the people to choose those who dispense justice. Regarding the so-called 'irregularities', such as the distribution of accordions and the presence of observers allegedly linked to parties, it is a matter of isolated situations and not a systematic strategy to alter the result. In several countries with consolidated democracies, it is common for citizens to orient themselves to their base on voting recommendations, as long as there is no coercion. On the other hand, any improper conduct by observers must be investigated and punished in accordance with the law, but it has not been documented that this has compromised the integrity of the process. The most fundamental criticism is, without a doubt, to the direct election model. The OEA recommends not replicating it in other countries, under the argument that it could affect the independence of the judiciary. This position, however, reveals a conservative vision that fears losing control over an institution that for decades has responded to pacts between political, economic, and media elites. On the contrary, subjecting the Poder Judicial to citizen scrutiny is a way to strengthen its legitimacy, bring it closer to the people, and break with the corporatism that has characterized it. The opposition seeks to use these criticisms to discredit the process. They call for the election to be annulled, which is not an act of democratic defense, but of the restoration of their lost privileges. Mexico has taken a firm step towards justice close to the people. As with any democratic innovation, this model requires adjustments, but not setbacks. The judicial election must be perfected and consolidated as an exercise of popular sovereignty.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 09, 2025 04:05 AM\nSource:[El Heraldo de M\ufffdxico](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/opinion/2025/6/9/elegir-jueces-es-democracia-705650.html)\n\n**Israeli Judiciary Window Shattered During Right-Wing Protest**\nThe Israeli judiciary announced on Saturday that a window in the Supreme Court building in Jerusalem was shattered during a right-wing protest on Thursday, possibly by a high-pressure water gun or a sledgehammer. The police have launched an investigation into the incident, which was discovered on Friday morning. The court said that the investigation is ongoing to identify the suspects. The court added, 'This is an unusual and serious incident that has never happened before. Its proximity to the protest and the messages that were shouted during it against the Supreme Court are a cause for concern.' If the window was intentionally shattered, 'it must be treated with the necessary seriousness and the perpetrators brought to justice.' The court also stated that 'the harm to the Supreme Court... exceeds the red line and harms the basic values of Israeli democracy.' Tensions between the government and the Supreme Court have risen in recent months over the government's efforts to pass controversial legislation to reform the judiciary, led by Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a member of the Likud party led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The legislation, which sparked massive protests across Israel in most of 2023, was postponed after a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, and the start of the war in Gaza, but has returned to the forefront. As part of his opposition to the courts, Levin spent 16 months refusing to hold a vote on the appointment of a new president for the Supreme Court after the retirement of the previous president, Esther Hayut, in October 2023. The court eventually ordered Levin to allow the vote, and a committee of judges appointed Judge Itzhak Amit as the new president of the Supreme Court. Levin refused to recognize Amit's authority and insisted that he would not work with him on the court's core issues. He repeated these statements on Saturday, just before the judiciary announced that a window in the Supreme Court was shattered during the protests. He told Israeli public broadcaster, 'The judge Amit is not the president of the Supreme Court. I do not recognize him and will not recognize him because he was elected through an illegal and invalid process.' In a conversation with the media, he condemned 'in the strongest terms' the shattering of the window during the protest on Thursday, but seemed to link the incident to his belief that right-wing protesters and activists are treated more harshly than their left-wing counterparts. He said to the broadcaster, 'The terrible selective enforcement that is happening in all matters related to incitement and harming elected officials will ultimately lead to great catastrophes,' adding, 'There is no greater danger than the feeling that people have of not having justice.' Netanyahu also seemed to allude to the incident without directly mentioning it, and chose to condemn violence 'in all its forms.' He called on law enforcement officials and citizens to 'condemn all forms of violence and incitement and take decisive action against them without exception.' The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, blamed the government for the incident. He pointed out that 'the government organized the protest, and the incident is a direct result of its incitement. I warned more than a month ago: if the Prime Minister does not stop it, it will end in a political crime.' The President of the State, Isaac Herzog, also condemned the incident, defending the Supreme Court as 'one of the pillars of Israeli democracy.' He said that 'violence, incitement, and vandalism are unacceptable in any form and must be eliminated decisively.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 08, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[\u062a\u0627\u064a\u0645\u0632 \u0623\u0648\u0641 \u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644](https://ar.timesofisrael.com/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%84%d8%b7%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%82%d8%b6%d8%a7%d8%a6%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%ad%d8%b7%d9%85-%d9%86%d8%a7%d9%81%d8%b0%d8%a9-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%85%d8%a9/)\n\n**Ultra-Orthodox Parties Threaten to Bring Down Netanyahu's Government**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing an internal challenge that could be the most significant threat to his government: the draft law exempting ultra-Orthodox Jews from mandatory military service. After a long delay, the ultra-Orthodox parties, 'Shas' and 'Yahadut HaTorah', have issued a stern warning: if the law is not passed within the current week, they will dissolve the Knesset and call for early elections. The vote on the law is scheduled for Wednesday, with strong support from the opposition and ultra-Orthodox parties, but the possibility of the coalition collapsing remains strong, with a deepening rift between Netanyahu and Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuli Edelstein, who opposes the law and insists on a 'real and active' draft law. The government is racing against time, and all attempts at old-fashioned political bribery - through budgets and grants - have failed to convince the ultra-Orthodox, who are also facing a growing crisis of legitimacy within the Likud itself. Alternative proposals have been put forward, including Edelstein's removal and replacement with a loyal Netanyahu deputy to pass the law, which was proposed by Communications Minister Shlomo Karai. The division within the coalition is deepening, with the ultra-Orthodox launching a scathing attack on Edelstein, accusing him of coordinating with the opposition to bring down the government. Edelstein has responded defiantly, saying, 'I will not back down... and they will have to take responsibility', a stance that could trigger the biggest explosion in a hot summer of politics. If the law fails to pass or the Knesset is dissolved during the current summer session, Israel will head towards early elections to be held after the Sukkot holidays, in October next year.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 05:05 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0629](https://www.assawsana.com/article/677162)\n\n**Mexico's Judiciary Under Siege: A Farce and a Tragicomedy**\nThe Mexican government's control over the judiciary has been solidified with the election of a new Supreme Court, with many of the winners being closely tied to President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. The election process was marred by low voter turnout, with only 12.4% of eligible voters casting ballots. The government's manipulation of the process, including the distribution of pre-marked ballots, has been widely criticized. The new minister of the Supreme Court, Hugo Aguilar Ortiz, owes his position to L\u00f3pez Obrador, as do several other winners. The election has been seen as a 'farce' and a 'tragicomedy' with serious consequences for the country. 'It was a great day', said President Claudia Sheinbaum, but the legitimacy of the election is widely disputed. The government's actions have been described as 'fraudulent' and have undermined the country's democratic institutions. 'The legitimacy of the election is based on the participation of the people', said Epigmenio Ibarra, a videographer for the former president. 'When a power aligns the social subsystems, there is no legitimacy.' Mexico has been classified as a 'hybrid regime' by The Economist, a status that reflects its irregularities and lack of democratic institutions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/opinion/raymundo-riva-palacio/2025/06/04/la-farsa-primer-acto/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across the expert forecasts, there is consensus that the probability of Israel's next election being formally contested for legitimacy or postponed (as defined by the strict resolution criteria) is significantly elevated compared to historical norms, but still not the most likely outcome. All experts recognize that factors such as extreme political polarization, deteriorating public trust, open attacks on judicial independence, ongoing or potential security crises, and recent elite rhetoric calling election legitimacy into question have raised the base rate for such an event. The most plausible pathways to a 'Yes' outcome are: (1) a major security escalation prompting the Knesset\u2014if 80 members can be persuaded\u2014to formally postpone the election; (2) an unprecedented Supreme Court ruling in which at least one justice, likely in dissent, supports national-level nullification due to severe irregularities; or (3) the President, under exceptional circumstances, publicly declaring the election results illegitimate. However, all forecasters highlight formidable legal and institutional barriers: election postponement requires an 80-seat supermajority in the Knesset (rarely achievable), the Supreme Court has never nullified a national election result, and the President traditionally exercises rhetorical restraint. There is widespread acknowledgment that, although minor contestation and fraud allegations are common, meeting the strict institutional thresholds specified in the resolution remains unlikely. Probabilities assigned vary, with most experts clustering between 16% and 35%, reflecting both the elevated risks and the continued resilience of Israeli electoral and constitutional processes. The consensus is that, barring a truly extreme security or political crisis, elections will proceed and be accepted by institutions, but the probability of a systemic contestation or postponement is now higher than at any time in Israel's democratic history.",
