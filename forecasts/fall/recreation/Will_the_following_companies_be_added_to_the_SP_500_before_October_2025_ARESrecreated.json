Recent committee actions show willingness to exercise discretion for non-technical reasons. With the September quarterly rebalance just completed and several companies already added, the next likely windows are December 2025 or sooner if a constituent is removed. The base rate for any one eligible candidate is around 20-40% over a one-year window, but given ARES's strong fundamentals and the potential for a financials opening, a slightly elevated probability is justified.

However, the S&P 500 committee's recent actions\u2014especially the decision to exclude technically qualified, high-profile companies like MSTR\u2014underscore the discretionary and sometimes conservative nature of the process. While ARES faces no obvious technical hurdles, sector balance and index turnover limits mean inclusion is far from guaranteed. The base rate for any single eligible company is well below 50%. Given the Financials sector's current representation and lack of clear vacancies, combined with the committee\u2019s demonstrated willingness to pass over qualified names, I see the probability as somewhat above the base rate but still only moderately likely.

The recent inclusion of Robinhood and AppLovin\u2014both outside-the-box picks\u2014demonstrates a willingness to refresh the index, particularly with firms that have clear, sustainable business models and sectoral heft. ARES is not some fringe candidate; it is a powerhouse in alternative asset management, a sector the index has already signaled openness to through the inclusion of BX, APO, and KKR. Your 'base rate' is stuck in the past, ignoring the new normal of accelerated sector rotation and the committee's recent emphasis on forward-looking representativeness. Status quo bias exists, but so does momentum, and you downplay how quickly the window can open for a firm with ARES's profile. Your forecast is not realism\u2014it's inertia dressed up as prudence."

The critiques of higher estimates (65-85%) were especially persuasive, highlighting that even strong candidates like ARES face stiff competition and slow index churn. However, the arguments for a probability much lower than my initial estimate (around 18%) may underweight ARES's excellent eligibility profile, sector precedent set by BX/APO/KKR, and the possibility of opportunistic committee moves, especially given the recent addition of financials (e.g., Robinhood).

The critiques of much higher (>60%) probabilities are persuasive: they overstate the base rate and underweight status quo inertia and sector balancing. The only new argument meriting slight upward adjustment is that ARES is a particularly clean, profitable, and uncontroversial candidate (per some group members), and the upcoming year does offer multiple rebalancing windows.

The critique that recent additions (BX, APO, KKR) are not a guarantee of a new wave, but rather exceptions in a slow, discretionary process, is compelling. While ARES is still a top candidate and faces no technical or reputational barriers, the limited turnover, unpredictable committee discretion, and competition from other eligible firms lower the odds.

The decision is a setback not only for Strategy but for the broader cohort of corporate crypto treasuries that use balance\u2011sheet bitcoin accumulation. The report points out that Strategy\u2019s inclusion in other major benchmarks\u2014such as the Nasdaq\u202f100 and MSCI indices\u2014has quietly given bitcoin a backdoor into retail and institutional portfolios. JPMorgan warns that the S&P\u202f500 decision could mark the limit of that trend and may prompt other index providers to rethink the inclusion of bitcoin\u2011heavy companies. Adding to the pressure, Nasdaq has reportedly begun requiring shareholder approval before companies can issue new stock to buy crypto. Strategy recently abandoned its no\u2011dilution pledge, indicating a willingness to issue shares at lower multiples to continue funding bitcoin purchases.

JPMorgan analysts, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, described the move as a \"blow to crypto treasuries\" and warned that it signals caution toward firms that function primarily as bitcoin funds. The decision affects not only Strategy but also other crypto\u2011treasury companies that have emerged recently. Strategy, the largest public crypto\u2011treasury firm, had previously been included in major benchmarks such as the Nasdaq\u202f100, MSCI\u202fUSA, MSCI\u202fWorld and the Russell\u202f2000, which had helped drive its stock performance. The rejection suggests that the indirect channel for bitcoin exposure through index inclusion may be \"reaching its limits,\" according to the JPMorgan report. The article notes that other index providers might reconsider adding similar firms after the S&P\u202f500\u2019s lead, potentially restricting their access to broader investment portfolios. Additional pressures include Nasdaq\u2019s new requirement for shareholder approval before issuing shares to fund crypto purchases, and a recent shift by Strategy away from a pledge to avoid issuing shares below a 2.5\u2011multiple. Market fatigue is evident in declining equity issuance volumes and slowing funding activity for crypto\u2011treasury firms, while debt issuance continues with higher risk premiums. JPMorgan analysts warn that skepticism toward bitcoin\u2011backed loans, token\u2011linked convertibles and other structured financing is growing, and that capital may shift toward crypto companies with operating businesses such as exchanges and miners. The S&P\u202f500 rejection reflects broader market concerns about companies whose primary business model revolves around holding cryptocurrency rather than traditional operations, and could reshape how crypto\u2011focused companies structure their balance sheets moving forward.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/sp-500-rejects-strategy-despite-meeting-eligibility-criteria-jpmorgan-reports/)\n\n**Part of the Club: Robinhood & AppLovin Soar on S&P 500 Inclusion**\nThe article reports that on September\u202f8, 2025, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:\u202fHOOD) and AppLovin (NASDAQ:\u202fAPP) were added to the S&P\u202f500 Index, a move that validates their business fundamentals and is expected to drive further share demand.  At the time of inclusion, Robinhood had a market capitalization of $33\u202fbillion and AppLovin $109\u202fbillion; about 25\u202f% of S&P\u202f500 constituents began 2025 with lower market caps, making the addition seem inevitable.  Shares reacted strongly: Robinhood closed up nearly 16\u202f% and AppLovin rose almost 12\u202f%.  Prior to the price action, both stocks had surged 496\u202f% and 520\u202f% over the previous 52\u202fweeks, respectively, but the article notes that such gains are not solely speculative.  S&P requires a positive GAAP net income over the last 12\u202fmonths; Robinhood has maintained positive GAAP net income for seven consecutive quarters, while AppLovin has done so for nine quarters, underscoring their profitability.  In contrast, Bitcoin\u2011buyer Strategy (NASDAQ:\u202fMSTR) \u2013 which also meets the market\u2011cap threshold of $22.7\u202fbillion \u2013 has shown positive GAAP net income only two of eight quarters, making it a less likely candidate for inclusion.  The article explains that passive funds such as BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core S&P\u202f500 ETF (NYSEARCA:\u202fIVV), which holds roughly $667\u202fbillion in net assets, will need to purchase the new constituents to track the index, creating additional buying pressure.  Active managers may also adjust their holdings toward the new index weights, further supporting demand.  Overall, the article presents the inclusion as a credibility boost for the companies, while noting that long\u2011term success will still depend on continued earnings growth and business expansion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 06:31 PM\nSource:[Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/part-of-the-club-robinhood-and-applovin-soar-on-s-and-p-500-inclusion/)\n\n**Strategy's (MSTR) S&P 500 Snub Signals Chill for Corporate Bitcoin (BTC) Treasuries: JPMorgan**\nJPMorgan\u2019s analyst report notes that Strategy\u2019s (MSTR) bid to join the S&P\u202f500 was rejected even though it met all technical eligibility criteria, a move the bank says signals growing caution toward companies that function as de\u2011facto bitcoin funds.

The S&P\u202f500 rejection reflects broader market concerns about companies whose primary business model revolves around holding cryptocurrency rather than traditional operations, and could reshape how crypto\u2011focused companies structure their balance sheets moving forward.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/sp-500-rejects-strategy-despite-meeting-eligibility-criteria-jpmorgan-reports/)\n\n**Part of the Club: Robinhood & AppLovin Soar on S&P 500 Inclusion**\nThe article reports that on September\u202f8, 2025, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:\u202fHOOD) and AppLovin (NASDAQ:\u202fAPP) were added to the S&P\u202f500 Index, a move that validates their business fundamentals and is expected to drive further share demand.  At the time of inclusion, Robinhood had a market capitalization of $33\u202fbillion and AppLovin $109\u202fbillion; about 25\u202f% of S&P\u202f500 constituents began 2025 with lower market caps, making the addition seem inevitable.  Shares reacted strongly: Robinhood closed up nearly 16\u202f% and AppLovin rose almost 12\u202f%.  Prior to the price action, both stocks had surged 496\u202f% and 520\u202f% over the previous 52\u202fweeks, respectively, but the article notes that such gains are not solely speculative.  S&P requires a positive GAAP net income over the last 12\u202fmonths; Robinhood has maintained positive GAAP net income for seven consecutive quarters, while AppLovin has done so for nine quarters, underscoring their profitability.  In contrast, Bitcoin\u2011buyer Strategy (NASDAQ:\u202fMSTR) \u2013 which also meets the market\u2011cap threshold of $22.7\u202fbillion \u2013 has shown positive GAAP net income only two of eight quarters, making it a less likely candidate for inclusion.  The article explains that passive funds such as BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core S&P\u202f500 ETF (NYSEARCA:\u202fIVV), which holds roughly $667\u202fbillion in net assets, will need to purchase the new constituents to track the index, creating additional buying pressure.  Active managers may also adjust their holdings toward the new index weights, further supporting demand.  Overall, the article presents the inclusion as a credibility boost for the companies, while noting that long\u2011term success will still depend on continued earnings growth and business expansion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 06:31 PM\nSource:[Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/part-of-the-club-robinhood-and-applovin-soar-on-s-and-p-500-inclusion/)\n\n**Strategy Misses S&P 500 Inclusion This Month: Will It Ever Make the Cut?**\nStrategy (MSTR), the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, was omitted from the S&P\u202f500 during the latest quarterly rebalancing, with AppLovin (APP), Robinhood (HOOD) and Emcor (EME) added instead. The company meets all eligibility criteria\u2014U.S. domicile, a market capitalization above $22.7\u202fbillion, profitability in the most recent quarter and year, and at least 50\u202f% of shares publicly available\u2014but the Index Committee also weighs sector weighting and other factors. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimates that $22\u202ftrillion is linked to S&P\u2011500\u2011based products, and Stephens analysis says fund managers would need to buy roughly 50\u202fmillion Strategy shares worth about $16\u202fbillion if the firm were added. After reporting a $10\u202fbillion profit in the last quarter, Strategy still fell short of inclusion. Former committee chair David Blitzer told Bloomberg that the committee\u2019s goal is \u2018to have an index that really is a great measure of the market.\u2019 He added, \u2018The market goes up, the index goes up.

The update adds AppLovin Corp. (APP), Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), and Emcor Group Inc. (EME) to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), and Enphase Energy (ENPH), which will move to smaller\u2011cap indexes. Bloomberg reports that Robinhood\u2019s inclusion marks a shift from a pandemic\u2011speculation platform to a mainstream brokerage that now manages billions in assets across stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. The article cites that HOOD stock has gained over 434% in the past year and that being added to the S&P 500 automatically places the company into index funds, pensions, and retirement accounts worldwide, thereby expanding its institutional footprint. Other changes include Uber Technologies (UBER) joining the S&P 100, replacing Charter Communications (CHTR); MP Materials (MP) and Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS) moving into the S&P MidCap 400; and several firms\u2014Wendy\u2019s (WEN), MarketAxess, Caesars, Enphase, Acadia Healthcare (ACHC), and ManpowerGroup (MAN)\u2014transitioning to the S&P SmallCap 600.

Balchunas explained, 'Why wasn\u2019t $MSTR allowed into the S&P 500 Index despite meeting all the criteria? Because the Committee said no.'

If the company were accepted, passive index\u2011tracking funds would need to purchase roughly 50\u202fmillion shares, creating an estimated $16\u202fbillion inflow at current market prices.  The S&P\u202f500 committee evaluates liquidity, profitability, trading history, and sector balance; it requires a minimum market capitalization of $22.7\u202fbillion and positive income for the current and past four quarters.  Strategy\u2019s market cap exceeds $90\u202fbillion, comfortably above the threshold.  The technology sector dominates the index, and recent additions such as Coinbase Global and Block (founded by Jack\u202fDorsey) signal growing recognition of digital assets.  Melissa Roberts, managing director at Stephens, noted that \u2018If someone is a big player in the space, it\u2019s hard to ignore them.\u2019  Nonetheless, skepticism remains about the sustainability of Strategy\u2019s corporate\u2011treasury model, which raises capital through debt and equity to acquire Bitcoin.  Shares fell 17\u202f% in August, eroding the premium over Bitcoin holdings, and the 30\u2011day price volatility reached 96\u202f%, higher than that of Nvidia or Tesla, potentially raising red flags for the committee.  Although Strategy was included in the Nasdaq\u202f100 last December, the S&P\u202f500 is larger, with nearly $10\u202ftrillion tied to passive strategies.

The company\u2019s market cap of $90\u202fbillion, liquidity of nearly $70\u202fbillion in Bitcoin, and positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the past four quarters satisfy the index\u2019s requirements of U.S. domicile, a market cap of at least $22.7\u202fbillion, and profitability. Among 26 candidates, Strategy topped the float\u2011adjusted liquidity ratio, a key metric for inclusion. Melissa Roberts, head of index rebalancing research at Stephens, told Bloomberg, 'They care about building representation of leading companies in the 500. So, if someone is a big player in the space, it\u2019s hard to ignore them.' The S&P committee, however, retains discretion, citing concerns over sector balance and the company\u2019s 30\u2011day price volatility of 96\u202f%, higher than Nvidia\u2019s 77\u202f% and Tesla\u2019s 74\u202f%. A failed preferred\u2011stock sale earlier this year forced Strategy to issue common stock, causing the share price to fall 17\u202f% in August. Despite these risks, passive index funds would need to buy roughly 50\u202fmillion shares\u2014about $16\u202fbillion at current prices\u2014if the company is added, turning institutional investors into indirect Bitcoin holders overnight. Research by Antti Petajisto shows that new S&P 500 entrants typically rally on inclusion, an effect that has slowed but still exists. Edward Yoon of Macquarie Capital warned that meeting eligibility does not guarantee inclusion, noting that the committee\u2019s discretion and sector\u2011weighting rules remain decisive.

    "summary": "Forecasters assessing the likelihood of Ares Management (ARES) being announced as an addition to the S&P 500 before October 2025 broadly agree that the company meets all technical criteria for inclusion\u2014market capitalization, profitability, liquidity, US domicile, and a straightforward corporate structure. Several experts view ARES as a textbook candidate: large, profitable, established, and in a sector that has recently seen similar firms (e.g., Blackstone, Apollo) added to the index. The main reasons increasing ARES's probability are its strong, recurring GAAP profitability, sectoral relevance as an alternative asset manager with growing economic importance, and absence of negative news or disqualifying issues.\n\nHowever, all experts emphasize the key role of the S&P 500 Index Committee's discretion. Even among highly eligible companies, committee decisions are influenced by sector representation, index turnover rates, recent rebalancing activity, and broader market or regulatory considerations. The recent exclusion of technically qualified companies (e.g., MicroStrategy) underscores that meeting eligibility is not sufficient; the committee also weighs risk, stability, and strategic sector objectives. Some experts note the slow turnover rate in the index, with only a handful of new additions each year, and competition from other strong candidates that may be prioritized for sectoral or thematic reasons.\n\nConsensus scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome involve a current S&P 500 constituent (especially in financials) being removed, creating an opening that the committee fills with ARES due to its strong fundamentals and sector fit. A 'No' scenario arises if sector representation is already sufficient, few or no removals occur, or the committee opts to diversify the index with candidates from other sectors instead.\n\nProbability estimates vary significantly by perspective: the most cautious, accounting-focused forecasters (emphasizing base rates and committee conservatism) estimate an 18\u201323% chance. Most finance and equity research experts, weighing ARES's strong profile against moderate turnover and discretionary risk, assign probabilities of 30\u201335%. Strategic management and resource-based experts, who emphasize recent committee openness to alternative asset managers and ARES's strong competitive position, estimate much higher probabilities\u201465\u201385%\u2014contingent on the absence of negative shocks and a slot opening during index maintenance.\n\nIn sum, ARES is widely viewed as a highly qualified, likely-in-line candidate, but the unpredictability of S&P 500 committee decisions, limited turnover, and sector balancing reduce overall confidence. The distribution of estimates illustrates a substantial (though uncertain) chance of inclusion, contingent on external events and evolving committee priorities.",
