Even in the absence of meaningful identity-based change, a data vacuum could allow a CIS (or similar) outlier to flip the average, creating a non-substantive 'Yes' outcome. This tail risk is nontrivial and, as pointed out in multiple critiques, has historical precedent. Given this, I am increasing my probability to reflect the aggregation artifact risk.",

The consensus around structural status quo inertia remains dominant, but the fieldwork gap and aggregation bias in December create a real, nontrivial tail risk of a technical Yes outcome even if underlying voter sentiment hasn't changed. This risk is higher than what a theory- or base-rate-only analysis would suggest.

Multiple forecasters from public opinion research and polling methodology backgrounds highlighted the risk that, as private pollsters reduce activity in December, the CIS (a pro-PSOE outlier) could disproportionately affect the Politico Poll of Polls average. Prior years have shown that the aggregate can be mechanically tipped by a single CIS release when other data is scarce, even if underlying voter intentions remain stable. This 'phantom swing' is not just theoretical and represents a genuine, non-negligible tail risk, especially as the current gap between PP and PSOE is not insurmountable if the mix of polls changes. While my core view on the base rate and structural inertia remains unchanged, I now see the aggregation artifact as a more plausible path to a 'Yes' resolution than I initially weighted.

The CIS poll shows PSOE at 32.7% and PP at 23.7%, giving the PSOE a nine\u2011point lead and indicating a shift away from the previous technical tie. In contrast, the NC Report gives PP a clear advantage with 35.2% of the vote and 156 seats, while PSOE sits at 25.8% and 104 seats. The GAD3 poll also favours PP with 32% of the vote and 137 seats, PSOE at 26.9% and 107 seats, Vox at 17.9% and 61 seats, and Sumar at only 10 seats. Carmelo Jord\u00e1\u2019s analysis in Libertad Digital highlights the volatility of the electorate and the wide dispersion of results across different polling firms, noting that parties interpret each figure to fit their communication strategy. The piece underscores that the current political landscape is marked by uncertainty, with parties like \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez\", \"Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o\", and \"Santiago Abascal\" each facing different challenges as reflected in the varying poll outcomes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 03:35 PM\nSource:[Periodista digital](https://www.periodistadigital.com/politica/20250923/claves-ultimas-encuestas-debe-preocuparse-abascal-sanchez-o-feijoo-noticia-689405135472/)\n\n**Soria and Burgos PP Parliamentarians Protest A\u201111 Highway Delays**\nSpanish parliamentarians from the Partido Popular (PP) in the provinces of Burgos and Soria met in Aranda de Duero on 23\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 to publicly accuse the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez of failing to advance the A\u201111 highway. Senator Javier\u202fLacalle of Burgos cited the Langa\u202fde\u202fDuero\u2013Aranda\u202fde\u202fDuero section, where no work has been done for over a month, and said the government has already certified \u20ac11\u202fmillion of the \u20ac11\u202fmillion budgeted for 2025, warning that 'Se van a perder todos los meses que faltan hasta fin de a\u00f1o'. He asked for an additional \u20ac10\u201315\u202fmillion for the current year. Lacalle also noted that the 2025 budget of \u20ac25\u202fmillion will be insufficient to complete the remaining \u20ac150\u202fmillion of the project, which he described as 'impossible for companies to execute the last year of the 150\u202fmillion remaining, simply due to the necessary procedures and phased tenders'. He proposed reallocating \u20ac80\u202fmillion for 2026 and \u20ac90\u202fmillion for 2027 to maintain continuity. Senator Jos\u00e9\u202fManuel\u202fHernando of Soria complained that the delay is 'absolutely deliberate and conscious', citing the stalled connection between the A\u201111 and A\u201115 (La\u202fMallona\u2013Los\u202fR\u00e1banos) whose original project expired and had to be re\u2011tendered in two phases, extending the update to 24\u202fmonths with no current tender date. He also mentioned the pending connection from Los\u202fR\u00e1banos to Fuensa\u00faco and the A\u201115 segments between Villar\u202fdel\u202fCampo\u2013Agreda and Agreda\u2013Tarazona, all lacking start dates. Hernando highlighted the most critical section between Fuensa\u00faco and Villar\u202fdel\u202fCampo, where work began with a \u20ac100\u202fmillion budget but only \u20ac3.5\u202fmillion has been certified in the first of the five years planned. He called the 'technique of delay in roads' a 'true trickery' for the people of Soria. The PP parliamentarians plan to submit questions to both chambers, a Senate motion, and a non\u2011law proposition in Congress demanding a multi\u2011year budget redistribution to accelerate the A\u201111.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 12:22 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/castilla-y-leon/noticia-parlamentarios-populares-soria-burgos-denuncian-total-falta-voluntad-politica-avanzar-11-20250923140113.html)\n\n**Pedro Ruiz warns of political shift as polls point to new government**\nThe article reports on recent opinion polls that suggest a potential shift in Spain\u2019s political landscape if general elections were held now. According to the ABC\u2011GAD3 survey published on 14 September, the Partido Popular (PP) would win 137 seats in the Congress, a drop of 1.8 percentage points and 8 seats from the June 2025 poll. The PSOE would secure 107 seats, 14 fewer than in 2023. Vox could double its representation, reaching 61 seats from 33 in July 2023. Combined, the right\u2011wing bloc would hold 198 seats\u201422 above an absolute majority\u2014making a PP\u2011Vox coalition likely. Pedro Ruiz, a television presenter, comments that the polls indicate neither the government nor the opposition is hitting the mark, saying \u2018Dicen las encuestas que ni el gobierno ni la oposici\u00f3n est\u00e1n acertando\u2019. He warns that a current election would likely result in a change of government, with the right\u2011wing parties poised to take power if they secure Vox\u2019s support.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[ABC \ufeffTU DIARIO EN ESPA\u00d1OL](https://www.abc.es/recreo/pedro-ruiz-dicen-encuestas-sobre-proximas-elecciones-20250923090042-nt.html)\n\n**Key Findings from Recent Polls: Where Should Concern Be Greater, in Ferraz or in Genoa?**\nThe article reports on six recent opinion polls for a hypothetical general election, highlighting key trends for Spain\u2019s major parties.  All six polls show the Partido Popular (PP) falling, while the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE) rises in the majority of them.  The average gap between the two parties remains a high 7\u202f% (source: \"la diferencia entre ambos partidos se mantiene en un porcentaje elevado: un 7% haciendo la media de todas las encuestas\").  PP and Vox together would secure 199 seats on average\u201423 seats above the 176 needed for a simple majority in the Congress (source: \"la suma de los diputados que obtendr\u00edan PP y Vox siguen siendo una mayor\u00eda m\u00e1s que absoluta: seg\u00fan la media de los seis sondeos\u2026 llegar\u00eda a 199 diputados\").  Vox is the standout performer, with an average vote share of 16.3\u202f% and an average rise of 1.7\u202f% across the polls (source: \"los de Santiago Abascal suben en todas y cada una de las encuestas y la media de esta subida es de un 1,7%\u2026 el partido a la derecha del PP estar\u00eda en un 16,3% del voto\").  The piece also comments that PSOE\u2019s gains are modest and still below pre\u2011corruption\u2011scandal levels, while PP\u2019s decline is consistent and may erode its support base.  It concludes that both parties should reassess strategies, especially PP, which risks a precarious position if the trend continues (source: \"los populares est\u00e1n retrocediendo y\u2026 los de Feij\u00f3o tienen que tener claro que de seguir esta sangr\u00eda\u2026 pueden llegar a una situaci\u00f3n muy complicada\").\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 04:24 AM\nSource:[Libertad Digital](https://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/politica/2025-09-23/las-claves-de-las-ultimas-encuestas-donde-deben-estar-mas-preocupados-en-ferraz-o-en-genova-7298929/)\n\n**The Myth of 35\u202f%: An Analysis by Iv\u00e1n\u202fRedondo**\nThe article, written by Iv\u00e1n\u202fRedondo, argues that the widely cited \"35\u202f% myth\"\u2014the idea that the Spanish left can secure a 35\u202f% share of the vote\u2014has no basis in current electoral realities. Redondo cites several metrics to support his claim. He notes that the left\u2019s realistic ceiling is between 39\u202f% and 42\u202f% depending on right\u2011wing performance, and that the PP cannot realistically reach 35\u202f% because the two main paths to that figure\u2014either a clean split with the PSOE or a coalition with the right\u2011wing base\u2014are mutually exclusive. He also points out that the 2024 general election will likely see a turnout similar to 2015 (around 70\u202f%) and that the 23\u2011J election had 700\u202f000 fewer voters than 2015, underscoring a decline in left\u2011wing mobilization.\n\nRedondo quotes the headline, 'El mito del 35% de voto socialista o popular es vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n,' to emphasize his point. He further explains that the left\u2019s best chance to reach 35\u202f% would require a strategy akin to the 2008 Zapatero model, which he deems a \"craso error.\" He also references the 2022 Andalusian elections, where the PP gained 20\u202f000 votes, and the 2023 polls that show the PP could only reach 35\u202f% through incompatible routes.\n\nThe piece concludes that the myth of 35\u202f% is outdated and that the left must focus on realistic targets, while the PP\u2019s prospects are limited by structural constraints. The article is heavily opinionated, presenting a clear political bias in favor of a left\u2011leaning perspective.\n\nEvidence:\n- 35\u202f% myth is dismissed as \"vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n\".\n- Left\u2019s realistic ceiling: 39\u201142\u202f%.\n- PP cannot reach 35\u202f% via two incompatible paths.\n- 2024 turnout likely ~70\u202f% (like 2015).\n- 23\u2011J had 700\u202f000 fewer voters than 2015.\n- 2022 Andalusian PP gained 20\u202f000 votes.\n- Quote: 'El mito del 35% de voto socialista o popular es vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[lavanguardia.com](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20250922/11082617/mito-35.html)\n\n**Barcelona Council Survey Highlights PSC Lead and Fragmented Opposition**\nThe survey released by GESOP during the Merc\u00e8 festivities shows the Socialists (PSC) consolidating a lead in Barcelona\u2019s city council, with the party\u2019s mayor, Jaume Collboni, gaining one or two seats.  The opposition remains fragmented, with the most affected group, Junts, projected to drop from 11 to 7 councillors.  PSC\u2019s deputy mayor, Laia Bonet, praised the public\u2019s appreciation of the party\u2019s ability to reach agreements, noting that \"the formations that improved results were those that had a willingness to dialogue,\" referring to ERC.  The survey also highlights a \"very fragmented\" council, citing the high number of undecided voters and the potential entry of Alian\u00e7a Catalana, which would add two seats, and Vox, which would add one.  Junts\u2019 leader, Jordi Mart\u00ed, expressed doubt about the forecast, saying \"the 2027 election verdict will have nothing to do with it\" and that Collboni will lose \"never won them.\"  The survey revealed a split between BCom\u00fa and ERC over a left\u2011wing candidacy for 2027: BCom\u00fa, concerned about the rise of the far right, is open to a broad left\u2011wing coalition, with its leader Janet Sanz calling it \"a very good recipe,\" while ERC\u2019s Elisenda Alamany firmly rejected the idea, stating \"it is not an option that is on the table.\"  The PP\u2019s Daniel Sirera highlighted his strong name recognition, claiming \"we are on the right line,\" and the Vox president Gonzalo de Oro noted his group\u2019s growing vote share, though he urged caution in interpreting the polls.  The survey\u2019s key metrics include PSC\u2019s projected seat increase, Junts\u2019 projected loss from 11 to 7 seats, and the potential addition of two seats for Alian\u00e7a Catalana and one for Vox.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 02:50 PM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20250924/gobierno-collboni-lamenta-fragmentacion-bcomu-erc-121919052)\n\n**Barcelona Election Poll: PSC Leads, Junts and Com\u00fa Decline, ERC Gains**\nThe GESOP poll conducted from 15\u201119 September for El\u202fPeri\u00f3dico projects the 2027 Barcelona municipal election results. The socialists (PSC) would lead with 23.5\u202f% of the vote and 11\u201112 councilors, a gain of 3.9\u202fpercentage points over 2023. Junts would fall to 14.8\u202f% (7 councilors), down 7.4\u202fpoints, while Barcelona\u202fen\u202fCom\u00fa would drop to 14.2\u202f% (6\u20117 councilors). ERC would rise to 13\u202f% (6 councilors). The PP would hold 8.2\u202f% (4 councilors), Vox 7\u202f% (2 councilors), Alian\u00e7a\u202fCatalana 5.4\u202f% (2 councilors) and CUP 5\u202f% (2 councilors). The council would expand to 43 seats, raising the majority threshold to 22. Indecisive voters remain high at 24.3\u202f%. 57.7\u202f% of those who voted for Collboni in 2023 would vote for him again, but two\u2011in\u2011ten are now undecided.

Socialist spokesperson Patricia G\u00f3mez requested a minute of silence for Gaza victims, which the president of the Parliament, Carlos Poll\u00e1n, refused; G\u00f3mez then announced a silent protest that was joined by the UPL Soria\u2011\u00a1Ya! and Mixto groups but not by PP or Vox. The focus shifts to Junta President Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco, who used the session to launch a political attack on the PSOE. He accused the party of \"incompetencia, mentira y negligencia\", especially pointing to the failure of anti\u2011abuse bracelets issued by the Ministry of Equality, and warned that if the PSOE governed, it would harm \"sanidad, educaci\u00f3n, servicios sociales y protecci\u00f3n a las mujeres\".

Senator Javier\u202fLacalle of Burgos cited the Langa\u202fde\u202fDuero\u2013Aranda\u202fde\u202fDuero section, where no work has been done for over a month, and said the government has already certified \u20ac11\u202fmillion of the \u20ac11\u202fmillion budgeted for 2025, warning that 'Se van a perder todos los meses que faltan hasta fin de a\u00f1o'. He asked for an additional \u20ac10\u201315\u202fmillion for the current year. Lacalle also noted that the 2025 budget of \u20ac25\u202fmillion will be insufficient to complete the remaining \u20ac150\u202fmillion of the project, which he described as 'impossible for companies to execute the last year of the 150\u202fmillion remaining, simply due to the necessary procedures and phased tenders'. He proposed reallocating \u20ac80\u202fmillion for 2026 and \u20ac90\u202fmillion for 2027 to maintain continuity. Senator Jos\u00e9\u202fManuel\u202fHernando of Soria complained that the delay is 'absolutely deliberate and conscious', citing the stalled connection between the A\u201111 and A\u201115 (La\u202fMallona\u2013Los\u202fR\u00e1banos) whose original project expired and had to be re\u2011tendered in two phases, extending the update to 24\u202fmonths with no current tender date. He also mentioned the pending connection from Los\u202fR\u00e1banos to Fuensa\u00faco and the A\u201115 segments between Villar\u202fdel\u202fCampo\u2013Agreda and Agreda\u2013Tarazona, all lacking start dates. Hernando highlighted the most critical section between Fuensa\u00faco and Villar\u202fdel\u202fCampo, where work began with a \u20ac100\u202fmillion budget but only \u20ac3.5\u202fmillion has been certified in the first of the five years planned. He called the 'technique of delay in roads' a 'true trickery' for the people of Soria.

Jes\u00fas Morales, the party's spokesperson, said, 'Nos da igual que las elecciones sean en 2026 o 2027, estamos preparados', indicating readiness for elections in either year.  Morales accuses Aragonese President Jorge Azc\u00f3n of adopting Vox\u2019s platform across the region, claiming he 'beneficia a unos pocos y perjudica a la gran mayor\u00eda de los aragoneses'.  He also criticises the mayor of Quinto, Natalia Chueca, who called Azc\u00f3n 'el gran presidente ausente'.  The PSOE plans regional events in the three provinces to rally supporters.  Morales disputes the claim that the Spanish government will inject \u20ac2\u202fmillion into the Montmel\u00f3 circuit, arguing that the Aragonese Motorland circuit already received a \u20ac10\u202fmillion investment from the Teruel Investment Fund (Fite) for infrastructure upgrades.  He states, 'Es falso que Motorland no reciba inversi\u00f3n estatal', and notes that the Aragonese government has not requested any sports subsidies.  In response, Tomasa Hern\u00e1ndez, the regional minister, defended the \u20ac16\u202fmillion decree, noting that \u20ac5.8\u202fmillion (over 34\u202f%) was earmarked for Catalan projects that were pre\u2011selected without a competitive process.

Redondo cites several metrics to support his claim. He notes that the left\u2019s realistic ceiling is between 39\u202f% and 42\u202f% depending on right\u2011wing performance, and that the PP cannot realistically reach 35\u202f% because the two main paths to that figure\u2014either a clean split with the PSOE or a coalition with the right\u2011wing base\u2014are mutually exclusive. He also points out that the 2024 general election will likely see a turnout similar to 2015 (around 70\u202f%) and that the 23\u2011J election had 700\u202f000 fewer voters than 2015, underscoring a decline in left\u2011wing mobilization.\n\nRedondo quotes the headline, 'El mito del 35% de voto socialista o popular es vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n,' to emphasize his point. He further explains that the left\u2019s best chance to reach 35\u202f% would require a strategy akin to the 2008 Zapatero model, which he deems a \"craso error.\" He also references the 2022 Andalusian elections, where the PP gained 20\u202f000 votes, and the 2023 polls that show the PP could only reach 35\u202f% through incompatible routes.\n\nThe piece concludes that the myth of 35\u202f% is outdated and that the left must focus on realistic targets, while the PP\u2019s prospects are limited by structural constraints. The article is heavily opinionated, presenting a clear political bias in favor of a left\u2011leaning perspective.\n\nEvidence:\n- 35\u202f% myth is dismissed as \"vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n\".\n- Left\u2019s realistic ceiling: 39\u201142\u202f%.\n- PP cannot reach 35\u202f% via two incompatible paths.\n- 2024 turnout likely ~70\u202f% (like 2015).\n- 23\u2011J had 700\u202f000 fewer voters than 2015.\n- 2022 Andalusian PP gained 20\u202f000 votes.\n- Quote: 'El mito del 35% de voto socialista o popular es vivir t\u00e9cnicamente en Plut\u00f3n.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[lavanguardia.com](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20250922/11082617/mito-35.html)\n\n**PP Stagnates, Left Falls, Vox Surges Past 60 Seats**\nAccording to a GAD3 poll for ABC, if general elections were held now, the Partido Popular (PP) would win 137 seats, representing 32\u202f% of the vote\u2014exactly the same result as in July\u202f2023.

The coalition is starting to unravel due to the distrust of its partners, but none of them are willing to support a motion of censure with the PP and Vox. However, the possibility of an early election is no longer considered impossible, and Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the leader of the PP, is navigating with a very favorable wind, rekindled by the strong erosion of the socialists. According to the average of the main polls published in 2025, the PP is in first place with a 6.5-point advantage over the PSOE, which means that the gap has widened by two points in the last six months. The PP would obtain 34.1% of the votes and the PSOE would get 27.6%, with Vox growing in strength and Sumar declining. The calculations made by EL PERI\u00d3DICO, based on a formula used by Ivan Serrano, researcher at the IN3 of the UOC, correspond to the weighted average of the main polls published. The weighting is done in function of the size of the sample (the larger, the higher the value) and the date of the fieldwork (the more recent, the more significant). It is worth noting that some polls, such as those of the CIS, only offer estimates of votes, but not of seats, which affects the averages of each variable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 04, 2025 04:03 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20250704/encuestas-elecciones-generales-espana-sondeos-12274406)\n\n**PSOE Suffers Significant Decline in Support, PP Gains Ground**\nA recent poll by Sigma Dos for EL MUNDO shows a significant decline in support for the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez, with a 4.9-point drop in intention to vote to 26.8%. This is the party's lowest score since the 2023 general elections. The People's Party (PP) has gained 1.6 points, putting them 8 points ahead of the PSOE, with a potential 41-seat advantage if elections were held today. The PP's leader, Feij\u00f3o, could become president of the government with the support of Vox, but the transfer of votes from the PP to Vox is a concern, with the PP losing over 1 million votes to Vox. The poll also shows a decline in support for Sumar, the coalition led by Yolanda D\u00edaz, with a 7.5% intention to vote, down from 10.4% in the 2023 general elections. Podemos has also lost support, with a 4.5% intention to vote, down from 6.3% in the 2023 general elections. The poll suggests that the PSOE's decline is due to the corruption scandal surrounding the government, as well as dissatisfaction with S\u00e1nchez's leadership and performance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 09:10 PM\nSource:[EL MUNDO](https://www.elmundo.es/espana/encuestas/2025/06/29/686184d0fdddffed208b458d.html)\n\n**PP Leads in Recent Polls Amid PSOE Crisis**\nRecent polls show that the PP (People's Party) would win the elections with a significant lead over the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party), which is struggling due to an internal crisis. According to the T. Point poll, the PP would win with 33.5% of the votes, securing 145 seats, while the PSOE would come in second with 28.1% of the votes and 119 seats. Vox would come in third with 14.3% of the votes and 43 seats. These results suggest that the right-wing parties could form a coalition to make Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o the president of the government. The other parties, such as Sumar and Podemos, would suffer significant losses, with Sumar losing 10 seats and Podemos failing to reach the 5% threshold. The polls are consistent across different surveys, with the PP leading the PSOE by a significant margin.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 22, 2025 08:41 AM\nSource:[El Plural](https://www.elplural.com/politica/espana/encuestas-informe-cerdan-feijoo-abascal-imponen-psoe-minimos_354901102)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the consensus is that it is highly improbable that PSOE will overtake PP in the Politico poll average by December 31, 2025. Every expert notes that the current polling gap is substantial (usually 5\u20137 points), with the PP consistently ahead in all but the CIS polls, which are widely regarded as outliers due to pro-PSOE bias and are downweighted or diluted by most poll-of-polls aggregators like Politico.\n\nKey factors reducing the likelihood of a PSOE crossover include:\n- The structural and historical base rate that large late-year polling swings\u2014especially of 5+ points\u2014are rare in Spain without a major exogenous shock (e.g., political or economic crisis, major scandal).\n- The stability of party identification, cleavage structures, and identity-driven polarization, all of which limit rapid public opinion shifts.\n- The impact of recent and lingering scandals on PSOE (like the Cerd\u00e1n corruption affair), government performance issues, and the structural fragmentation of the left (Sumar, Podemos) versus consolidation or even slight erosion of the right (Vox gaining from PP).\n- The aggregation methodology of Politico, which reduces the effect of outlier polls such as the CIS.\n\nFactors cited as modestly increasing PSOE's chances include a slight recent narrowing of the gap in some polls, volatility created by the rise of Vox, and the perennial tail risk of an unforeseen event dramatically altering party standings. Nonetheless, most experts judge these are not currently strong enough to overcome the status quo.\n\n\"No\" scenarios dominate: experts expect stability or only minor further narrowing, with PP maintaining a clear lead in the poll average on December 31, 2025. The only plausible \"Yes\" scenarios hinge on an extraordinary, late-breaking shock or a methodological fluke in poll aggregation, neither of which experts find probable.\n\nThe numerical probabilities offered by the forecasters cluster overwhelmingly in the low-to-mid teens (7% to 18%), with a median around 10%. The analysis across fields (public opinion research, political science, sociology, election studies, European studies) is consistent: barring a major, currently unforeseeable event, the probability that PSOE will finish 2025 ahead of PP in the Politico poll average is low, and the status quo (PP ahead) is highly likely to persist.",
