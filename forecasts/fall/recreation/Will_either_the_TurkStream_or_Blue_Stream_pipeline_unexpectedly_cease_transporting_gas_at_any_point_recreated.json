(2) The operational and geopolitical incentives for rapid repair and continuity are extremely high, and so far, all previous attacks on TurkStream have caused only minor and quickly repaired damage, with no public record of an 'unexpected' cessation. (3) The technical resilience of these pipelines (buried, underwater, remote monitoring, redundancy in stations, hardened facilities) makes a successful and sustained attack difficult, but not impossible.

The base rate for true unexpected cessations in such pipelines is low\u2014outside of high-impact sabotage such as the Nord Stream 2022 incident, most attacks cause only minor, quickly repaired damage. Given that multiple attempted attacks on TurkStream have already been reported, the probability of a successful, question-resolving attack is not negligible. Still, the redundancy, high motivation for rapid repair, and robust operational management all serve to keep the risk moderate. The contract expiration on Blue Stream is unlikely to be a source of unexpected cessation, given it will be scheduled and negotiated. Overall, the risk is meaningfully above historical baseline but still below even odds, likely in the 15-25% range.

These attacks are growing in intensity, and there is political momentum (including U.S. approval) for further escalation. However, the pipelines' criticality, subsea routing, and enhanced security measures make a successful, sustained disruption challenging, and both Russia and Turkey are strongly incentivized to minimize downtime. The resolution criteria only require *any* unexpected cessation, even a short one, to trigger a 'Yes'. Given the convergence of intent, capability, and incentives, and the recent spike in successful strikes on oil/energy infrastructure, the risk is significantly elevated above the historical base rate, but still below 50% due to the pipelines' robust defenses and the high-level incentives for continuity.

Most attacks thus far have not targeted pipelines delivering gas directly to Turkey or Europe, or have been quickly repaired with no long-term disruption.

While these were thwarted or only caused minor, rapidly repaired damage, the high operational tempo and demonstrated intent mean a non-negligible risk remains, especially as TurkStream is now the sole route for Russian pipeline gas to Europe. Blue Stream is less exposed to direct attack, with its route entirely under Russian and Turkish (Black Sea) control, but still could face an unforeseen technical issue. The mutual interests of Turkey and Russia, and the strong security around these pipelines, lower the probability of a successful, unexpected, and public cessation.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nBoth pipelines are critical for energy security in Europe and Turkey, but they face challenges related to geopolitical tensions and contract expirations.&#x20;\n\nConcerning the TurkStream Pipeline, Russian gas supplies to Europe via TurkStream reached [a new](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/russian-gas-deliveries-via-turkstream-set-new-record-118255/) [all-time high](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/02/12/russian-gas-supplies-to-europe-via-turkstream-hit-new-all-time-high-in-january-a87962) in early 2025. This increase is partly due to Ukraine halting its transit of Russian gas to Europe on January 1, 2025, making TurkStream [the sole route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurkStream#Route) for Russian gas deliveries to Europe.\n\nFurther, Russia has accused Ukraine of attempting to attack the TurkStream pipeline on [multiple](https://energynews.pro/en/russia-accuses-ukraine-again-of-attacking-the-turkstream-pipeline/) [occasions](https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-repelled-ukrainian-drone-192450297.html). In March 2025, Russia [claimed](https://www.dailysabah.com/business/energy/russia-says-thwarted-ukrainian-drone-attack-on-turkstream-pipeline) to have intercepted drones targeting the pipeline, which it views as attempts to disrupt gas deliveries to Europe.&#x20;\n\nConcerning the Blue Stream pipeline, the major gas contract between Gazprom and Turkey for the pipeline [is set to expire](https://energynews.pro/en/turkey-facing-the-expiration-of-major-gas-contracts-in-2025-2026/) at the end of 2025. The Blue Stream pipeline is crucial for Turkey, providing about 60% of its Russian gas imports. However, occasional maintenance shutdowns and geopolitical tensions may pose challenges for Turkey's energy security.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36201,\"question_id\":35641}}`",

According to regional authorities, the strike caused only minor damage and posed no threat to the local population. The station, owned by Transneft\u2013Prikamye and part of the Almetyevsk\u2013Gorky trunk pipeline, contains six storage tanks with a total capacity of 120,000 cubic meters, as reported by the Moscow\u202fTimes. Ukrainian Commander\u2011in\u2011Chief Oleksandr\u202fSyrskyi said that over the past two months the Defense Forces have successfully hit 85 significant targets on Russian territory, 33 of which were strictly military and 52 were part of Russia\u2019s defense\u2011industrial complex. Syrskyi added that these operations have triggered a fuel crisis, directly affecting the military\u2019s logistics and supply. One such facility was the Afipsky oil refinery, attacked on September\u202f26, which processed about 6.25\u202fmillion tons of oil per year. Since early August, Ukraine has targeted Russian oil refining facilities, knocking out at least five major plants. Reuters reports that Russia\u2019s refining capacity has fallen 17\u202f% to 1.1\u202fmillion barrels per day, while Kommersant\u2019s sources say gasoline output is down about 10\u202f%. As a result, more than 300 gas stations have closed nationwide, and some regions have limited retail fuel sales to 10\u201320\u202fliters per customer. Exchange\u2011traded gasoline prices have risen 40\u201350\u202f% since the start of the year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u202fZelensky stated that U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump approved strikes on Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure and that Trump believes the attacks should follow an \u2018eye for an eye\u2019 principle.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 06:09 AM\nSource:[uawire.org](https://uawire.org/ukrainian-drone-strike-disrupts-operations-at-russian-oil-pumping-station-in-chuvashia)\n\n**Ukrainian Drone Attacks 'Friendship' Oil Pipeline Pump Station; Zelensky: Ukraine Will Implement Controlled Export of Non-Scarce Weapons; Latest Statements from Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers**\nAccording to the article, on 27 September 2025 a Ukrainian National Security Agency drone struck a pump station on Russia's 'Friendship' oil pipeline in the Chuvash Republic, causing a fire and halting oil transport. The article reports that Russian officials confirmed the attack but said it did not cause serious damage. Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said the attack did not affect Hungary's oil supply and later denied the drone evidence posted by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Shtyba. The article quotes Zelensky saying '\u4e4c\u5c06\u5bf9\u65e0\u77ed\u7f3a\u6b66\u5668\u5b9e\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u51fa\u53e3', indicating Ukraine will export weapons that are not in short supply, with exports controlled until the war ends, and that Ukraine plans to sell such weapons to Europe, the United States and some African countries. The article reports that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking at the 80th UN General Assembly, said Russia remains willing to resolve the conflict through dialogue, will discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, and that any aggression against Russia would be met with a firm response.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 11:36 PM\nSource:[\u6bcf\u65e5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b0\u95fb](https://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2025-09-28/4077904.html)\n\n**Critical Energy Pipeline Hit: Oil Pipeline to the Black Sea Disrupted**\nA drone strike in Chuvashia, about 1,000\u202fkm from the Ukrainian border, hit the Tynhgovatovo oil pumping station and temporarily shut down the pipeline that carries crude oil to the Black Sea. The attack, which occurred on 27\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, caused the pipeline to be closed for a short period. According to the article, the Chuvash Republic\u2019s president, Oleg\u202fNikolaev, posted on social media: 'Bug\u00fcn sabah, insans\u0131z hava ara\u00e7lar\u0131 kullanma giri\u015fimi kaydedildi.' The Russian Defence Ministry later reported that 55 drones were shot down during the night. The pipeline had also been struck on 9\u202fJune\u202f2025, leading to another temporary shutdown. Earlier, on 26\u202fSeptember\u202f2024, the Afipsky oil refinery in Krasnodar was hit by a similar drone attack; the resulting fire affected a 30\u2011square\u2011meter area and damaged one production unit, but no casualties were reported.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[T\u00fcrkiye](https://www.turkiyegazetesi.com.tr/dunya/kritik-enerji-hatti-vuruldu-karadenize-giden-petrol-borusu-devre-disi-1148877)\n\n**Ukraine's Oil Blitz Hits Putin**\nThe Telegraph reports that Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, pipelines and port terminals have caused a nationwide fuel shortage, higher prices, and government rationing of gasoline and diesel.  According to experts, the strikes cut oil processing by almost 20\u202f% on some days and disrupted exports from key ports, weakening Russia\u2019s ability to finance the war.  Fuel shortages have spread from the Far East to central Russia, including Moscow \u2013 the first time the capital has felt the impact of combat operations so close to civilian life.  Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak downplayed the situation, calling it a \u2018small deficit\u2019, but analysts say the drone attacks on domestic fuel supplies are severely affecting the population and businesses.  U.S. and EU pressure continues, with former President Donald Trump urging Europe to stop importing Russian energy and the EU accelerating its exit from Russian gas by the end of 2026.  Analysts argue that the attacks are among the most effective sanctions because they directly hit Russia\u2019s military budget.  \"The situation is not critical. Russia has enough oil and gas reserves and financial reserves to overcome this inconvenience, and the goal of conquering Ukraine is a much more valuable prize,\" said Emily\u202fFarris, RUSI analyst.  Recent drone strikes hit a pumping station in Chuvashia and the Afipsky refinery in Krasnodar Krai, the latter of which supplies diesel and gasoline to the Russian army.  \"On the domestic market, Ukrainian attacks have a large impact. Drones target facilities that supply internal fuel deliveries\u2026 across Russia there is a shortage, which further strains the already tense internal balance,\" said Luk\u202fVikenden, analyst at the Center for Energy and Clean Air.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 11:33 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u041d\u0406\u0410\u041d](https://www.unian.net/world/ataki-na-rossiyskie-npz-toplivnyy-krizis-porazil-putina-13144314.html)\n\n**Julia Lumumba Highlights Shared Values Between Russia and Africa Amid Ongoing Geopolitical Tensions**\nJulia Lumumba, daughter of Patrice Lumumba, visited Russia to celebrate the centenary of her father's birth and emphasised that the values for which he died\u2014freedom, justice, true economic and political independence, sovereignty and dignity\u2014are shared by both Russia and Africa. She noted that Russia was the first country to officially protest Patrice Lumumba\u2019s murder and that African nations can realise vast economic potential in a fair, multipolar world, saying, 'in a more just, more real, more multipolar world we have huge opportunities.'  The article then shifts to the ongoing Russia\u2011Ukraine conflict, reporting that Russian forces destroyed a Ukrainian unmanned craft off Crimea and that the Black Sea Fleet used \u2018Lanzet\u2019 anti\u2011ship munitions.  It cites a Telegram post from the Ministry of Defence that the targets were destroyed with small\u2011arms and \u2018Lanzet\u2019 munitions, and that the Russian navy also destroyed a Ukrainian drone\u2011boat on the same day.  The piece mentions a decision to limit non\u2011resident Russian citizens from transferring more than 1\u202fmillion\u202fUSD to foreign accounts, a restriction that will remain from 1\u202fOctober\u202f2025 to 31\u202fMarch\u202f2026.  It reports that Russia is a major supplier of gas, oil and refined products to Turkey, and that Turkish officials say it would be unprofitable to stop Russian supplies; the article quotes economist Igor Yushkov saying that a Turkish refusal would raise prices and benefit U.S. suppliers.  The article also covers U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for Turkey to drop Russian energy, the U.S. plan to double LNG exports, and the EU\u2019s accelerated ban on Russian LNG by 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2027.  In military news, Russian troops reportedly captured the village of Yunanovka in Sumy Oblast, destroying the \u2018live force and equipment\u2019 of several Ukrainian units, and Russian officials claim the capture disrupts Ukrainian logistics.  Finally, the article touches on political developments such as the EU\u2019s proposal for a \u20ac140\u202fbillion reparations loan to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, Belgium\u2019s criticism of the plan, and the Russian Ministry of Justice\u2019s new rules for social payments to mobilised personnel.  Throughout, the piece quotes officials and reports facts without overt editorialising.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 09:08 AM\nSource:[\u0412\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434](https://vz.ru/news/2025/9/27/1362767.html)\n\n**Ukrainian drone strike disrupts operations at Russian oil pumping station in Chuvashia**\nOn Saturday morning, September 27, Ukrainian drones struck the Tingovatovo oil pumping station near the village of Konar in the Tsivilsky district of Russia\u2019s Chuvash Republic, halting operations at the facility.

The attack caused a fire and halted oil transport through the station, but Russian officials confirmed that the damage was not serious.  Hungarian Foreign Minister Szil\u00e1gyi said the strike did not affect Hungary\u2019s oil supply.  President Zelensky announced that Ukraine will export weapons that are not in short supply to foreign buyers under a controlled regime until the war ends, prioritising the needs of the Ukrainian army and planning to ship surplus arms to Europe, the United States, the Middle East and several African countries.  He noted that a preliminary agreement has been reached with some African states and that one African country has been selected for further negotiations.  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Serebryak posted a map on social media showing the flight paths of two drones that entered Ukrainian airspace from Hungary on 26 September, a claim denied by Hungarian officials.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, speaking at the 80th UN General Assembly on 27 September, reiterated Russia\u2019s willingness to resolve the conflict through dialogue, emphasised the need to protect Russian\u2011speaking residents in Ukraine, and warned that any aggression against Russia would be met with a firm response.

She noted that Russia was the first country to officially protest Patrice Lumumba\u2019s murder and that African nations can realise vast economic potential in a fair, multipolar world, saying, 'in a more just, more real, more multipolar world we have huge opportunities.'  The article then shifts to the ongoing Russia\u2011Ukraine conflict, reporting that Russian forces destroyed a Ukrainian unmanned craft off Crimea and that the Black Sea Fleet used \u2018Lanzet\u2019 anti\u2011ship munitions.  It cites a Telegram post from the Ministry of Defence that the targets were destroyed with small\u2011arms and \u2018Lanzet\u2019 munitions, and that the Russian navy also destroyed a Ukrainian drone\u2011boat on the same day.  The piece mentions a decision to limit non\u2011resident Russian citizens from transferring more than 1\u202fmillion\u202fUSD to foreign accounts, a restriction that will remain from 1\u202fOctober\u202f2025 to 31\u202fMarch\u202f2026.  It reports that Russia is a major supplier of gas, oil and refined products to Turkey, and that Turkish officials say it would be unprofitable to stop Russian supplies; the article quotes economist Igor Yushkov saying that a Turkish refusal would raise prices and benefit U.S. suppliers.  The article also covers U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for Turkey to drop Russian energy, the U.S. plan to double LNG exports, and the EU\u2019s accelerated ban on Russian LNG by 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2027.  In military news, Russian troops reportedly captured the village of Yunanovka in Sumy Oblast, destroying the \u2018live force and equipment\u2019 of several Ukrainian units, and Russian officials claim the capture disrupts Ukrainian logistics.  Finally, the article touches on political developments such as the EU\u2019s proposal for a \u20ac140\u202fbillion reparations loan to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets, Belgium\u2019s criticism of the plan, and the Russian Ministry of Justice\u2019s new rules for social payments to mobilised personnel.

It claims that the GUR destroyed four Mi\u20118 helicopters, two Be\u201112 amphibious aircraft and the radar system \"Neblo\u2011U\" in Crimea, making the region more vulnerable and requiring additional resources. The piece also states that the SBU\u2019s Special Operations (SSO) finished an episode with a S\u2011400 surface\u2011to\u2011air missile system in Kaluga, destroying its launch platform and radar. \n\nThe article then details recent attacks: two production\u2011dispatch stations on the \"Transnft\u2011Druzhba\" pipeline in Bryansk and the \"Samara\" station on the \"Kuybyshev\u2011Tikhoretsk\" pipeline, both hit by SBU drones. It also reports a strike on the Astara gas\u2011processing plant, a major global petrochemical complex, with damage that could halt operations for at least a week. \n\nA further attack on the \"Gazprom Neftogaz Salavat\" plant in Bashkortostan is described as the second strike in ten days, reaching a distance of 1,400 km and producing a visible plume of black smoke. The article claims this demonstrates the SBU\u2019s ability to hit targets across Russia, from the Baltic to the Ural. \n\nThe piece concludes by stating that Russia has had to raise VAT to 22% to cover war costs, implying that the attacks have forced the country to divert resources from investment to defense. The tone is strongly critical of the Russian government, labeling it as \"destroying what was built by generations\". \n\nKey metrics cited: 4 Mi\u20118 helicopters, 2 Be\u201112 aircraft, 1,400 km attack range, 22% VAT increase, 2\u2011month timeframe for significant damage to the gas sector.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 03:40 PM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/ru/think/chto-demonstrirujut-dronovye-sanktsii-sbu-1080421.html)\n\n**Hungary Accuses EU of Failing to Uphold Energy Guarantees**\nOn September 26, 2025, Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 accused the European Union of failing to uphold its obligations to defend Hungary\u2019s interests after attacks on the Druzhba pipeline. He said Budapest received no guarantees from the EU or Kyiv following the attacks attributed to Ukraine, according to the daily *Magyar Nemzet*. Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 stated, 'La Comisi\u00f3n Europea no intervino, no se puso de nuestro lado ni se dirigi\u00f3 a Ucrania sobre este problema.' He reminded that the EU had previously stressed the critical importance of energy infrastructure for member states and that Hungary views the attacks as a direct assault on national sovereignty.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitri\u202fPeskow told journalists, 'Die verbleibende Leitung ist vorhanden, sie kann im Grunde genommen sofort gestartet werden'. The Nord\u202fStream system consists of two double pipelines, Nord\u202fStream\u202f1 and Nord\u202fStream\u202f2, running under the Baltic Sea. After the 2022 explosions, only one of the four lines\u2014part of Nord\u202fStream\u202f2\u2014remained intact, a fact that the article cites as a metric of the damage. German Chancellor Friedrich\u202fMerz said in May that preventing Nord\u202fStream\u202f2 from operating is part of efforts to pressure Russia into ending the war in Ukraine. Peskow said Russia hopes for a conclusion of the German\u2011led investigation into the attacks. A Ukrainian citizen was arrested in Italy last month on suspicion of involvement. Russia blames Kyiv, while the Ukraine denies any role. Both Moscow and the West describe the September\u202f26,\u202f2022 explosions as sabotage that disrupted a large portion of Russian gas deliveries to Europe. Peskow reiterated on Friday that the United States was partly responsible, saying, 'Wer hat das, sagen wir, gebilligt? ... es ist offensichtlich, dass solche Handlungen der Ukraine und des Kiewer Regimes ohne das Wissen der Regierung von (Joe) Biden in den USA unm\u00f6glich gewesen w\u00e4ren'.

The loss of this route has already pushed gas prices to an all\u2011time high and contributed to inflation across the continent. President Vladimir Putin said last week that there was no time left this year to sign a new Ukrainian gas transit deal, blaming Kyiv for refusing to extend the agreement. Gazprom reported a net loss of $7\u202fbillion in 2023, its first annual loss since 1999, largely due to the loss of EU gas markets. The only remaining Russian pipelines to Europe are Blue\u202fStream and TurkStream to Turkey; other routes such as Yamal\u2011Europe and Nord\u202fStream are closed. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean ordered preparations for the possible nationalisation of Moldovagaz, which is 50\u202f% owned by Gazprom, after the company announced it would suspend exports to Moldova from 0500\u202fGMT on 1\u202fJanuary because of unpaid debts. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said Slovakia would consider reciprocal measures against Ukraine if the gas transit stops, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Fico of opening a \u2018second energy front\u2019 against Ukraine on the orders of Russia. Gazprom plans to send 42.4\u202fmillion cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Monday, a volume in line with recent days, but it assumes no further gas will flow after 31\u202fDecember in its 2025 internal planning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[EurActiv.com](https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/russian-gas-flows-via-ukraine-for-last-day-as-transit-deal-crumbles/)\n\n**Ukraine tried to attack TurkStream infrastructure in Russia, Moscow says | Euractiv**\nRussia's defence ministry said that on Monday it shot down nine Ukrainian drones that were attempting to attack a compressor station on the TurkStream gas pipeline in the Krasnodar region. The facility remained operational and there were 'no casualties', and the drones caused 'minor damage' to a gas metering station, which emergency teams repaired quickly. TurkStream, which carries Russian gas to Turkey and Europe via Bulgaria, is one of Russia's last remaining pipeline routes after Ukraine refused to renew a five\u2011year transit deal earlier this year. The incident follows earlier reports of Ukrainian involvement in attacks on other Russian pipeline infrastructure, including the 2022 explosions on Nord Stream 1 and 2, for which the CIA allegedly warned Belgian authorities.

The attack was confirmed by Slovak authorities. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world\u2019s longest energy networks, carries crude oil over 4,000\u202fkm (2,485\u202fmiles) from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland. It runs through Ukraine and is the main route for Russian crude deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure; the most recent attacks on Druzhba occurred on August\u202f13 and August\u202f18. Kiev confirmed it fired drones at a key distribution station in Russia\u2019s Bryansk Region, threatening supplies to Hungary and Slovakia. Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said the transfers would stop while the damage is investigated. In addition, Ukrainian forces have attacked the TurkStream pipeline, which supplies natural gas to Turkey and several European countries, and earlier this year struck a gas metering station near Sudzha. Hungary, which has maintained a neutral stance and refuses to supply weapons to Kiev, has called for peace and criticized Western sanctions as ineffective.

Renominations for the Stranja-2/Malkochlar gas measurement station on June 11 show that the Turkish Stream pipeline has been stopped for repair and shows 0 million cubic meters. Since the beginning of 2025, gas transportation through this route has been 13.33% higher than the same period in 2024, with 7.46 billion cubic meters of gas delivered. Since January 1, 2025, transit of Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine's gas transportation system has been completely halted. The transit of gas through the Sojavka gas measurement station (the point of entry into Ukraine from Russia through the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline) has been stopped since January 1, 2025. Gazprom has stated that it has been deprived of the technical and legal ability to supply gas for transit through Ukraine after the expiration of the transit contract and inter-operator agreement signed on December 30, 2019. It is worth noting that on March 28, 2025, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that the Sudzha gas measurement station in the Kursk region had been destroyed as a result of a HIMARS rocket attack. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline was stopped on August 31, 2022, due to problems with gas pumping units (GPAs) Siemens, and on September 26, 2022, both of its lines were damaged in explosions in the Baltic Sea. The non-certified in the EU Nord Stream 2 pipeline has suffered damage to one of its lines, while the other remains intact, with reduced pressure and formally ready for operation. Another route for Russian gas supplies to Europe, the Yamal-Europe pipeline, has been inaccessible to Gazprom since May 11, 2022, due to the introduction of Russian counter-sanctions. Weather, reserves, and gas prices in Europe The weather in Europe remains warm, with negative temperatures recorded in southern Norway. A heatwave has established itself in southern Spain, Italy, southwestern France, western Croatia, and Greece. The Meteoalarm service has issued yellow-level warnings for high temperatures in France, Italy, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and orange-level warnings for Israel. From June 14, an increase in temperature is expected in Spain, Italy, and France, as well as in western Croatia. Wind power generation in Europe has begun to recover. According to WindEurope, as of June 10, 2025, wind power accounted for 17.6% of the demand for electricity in Europe (14.5% the previous day). According to Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), as of June 9, 2025, underground gas storage facilities (UGS) in the EU were filled to 51.79%, with 55.4 billion cubic meters of gas stored. The level of filling of UGS increased by 0.38 percentage points (0.43 percentage points the previous day). Gas injection was carried out by all EU countries, except for Denmark (which was taking gas out), Sweden, and Portugal (where there was no change). In Germany, UGS were filled to 43.71%, in France to 59.45%, in Austria to 57.28%, and in Italy to 63.51% (previously the largest Gazprom markets in Europe). Gas prices in Europe are approaching $430 per 1000 cubic meters. July gas futures on the TTF hub (Netherlands) on ICE Futures were trading at 35.43 euros/MW at 11:00 Moscow time on June 11, 2025, with a 2.29% increase compared to the previous day's calculated price.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/transport-and-storage/891128-postavki-rossiyskogo-truboprovodnogo-gaza-v-evropu-polnostyu-ostanovleny/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasting experts largely agree that the risk of an unexpected interruption to the TurkStream or Blue Stream pipelines is material but not highly probable in the final quarter of 2025. Most experts assign a probability between ~18% and ~33%, with one notably higher forecast at 57%\u2014reflecting stronger emphasis on escalation risk and intent/capability convergence. \n\nKey factors increasing risk include the escalation of Ukrainian drone and sabotage attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, the criticality of TurkStream as the last Russian pipeline to Europe (making it both a prime target and subject to extraordinary protection), and the high base rate of attacks on Russian oil infrastructure, which may portend similar targeting of gas lines. Multiple credible reports confirm attempted attacks on TurkStream, though none have caused an unexpected public cessation so far. Some experts also note that Western policy and tolerance for Ukrainian energy strikes may be fueling additional risk. \n\nImportant mitigating factors are the pipelines' technical resilience (especially undersea segments), robust security and rapid-repair capabilities by Russia and Turkey, the immense mutual incentives for both states to keep flows uninterrupted, and the ability\u2014particularly by authoritarian states\u2014to obscure minor incidents from public view. The Blue Stream pipeline contract's expiry at year-end is discounted as a risk due to the resolution criteria excluding scheduled or contract-related pauses.\n\nMost experts agree that the base rate for such unexpected gas pipeline outages outside of extraordinary sabotage (as with Nord Stream) is low. The historic record is one of continuity, even under geopolitical stress. The most likely path to a 'Yes' outcome would be a successful and significant Ukrainian drone or sabotage strike on a vulnerable compressor or metering station, or an unforeseen technical failure, causing at least a brief, credibly reported interruption. However, operational and political incentives make any such outage likely to be swiftly mitigated or even concealed.\n\nFinal assessed probabilities range from 18% to 33%, with a mean around 25%. One expert assigns a substantially higher risk (57%), emphasizing rising capabilities and political will for escalation. Consensus leans toward a status quo (\"No\") resolution being more probable, but risk is clearly higher now than at any time since the pipelines were commissioned, due to intensified conflict and increased attack sophistication.",
