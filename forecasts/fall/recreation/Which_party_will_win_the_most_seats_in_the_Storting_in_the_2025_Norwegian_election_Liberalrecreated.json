The far\u2011right Progress Party (FRP) doubled its share to about 24\u202f%. Prime Minister\u2011elect Jonas\u202fGahr\u202fSt\u00f8re will seek either a coalition with the other left parties or outside support for a minority AP government. The four smaller left\u2011bloc parties \u2013 Centre (SP), Socialist Left (SV), Red and Greens (MDG) \u2013 together hold 35\u202f% of the seats. The article notes that the parties approved a 12\u2011year military\u2011spending plan that will add 600\u202fbn\u202fkroner (\u2248\u202f\u20ac50\u202fbn) to the defence budget, including 136\u202fbn\u202fkroner for five frigates, and a new Arctic strategy \u201cNorway in the North\u201d. It also reports that the government will provide 85\u202fbn\u202fkroner to Ukraine in 2025. The GPFG, valued at \u20ac1.7\u202ftrillion, is capped at 3\u202f% annual spending, so the war\u2011related budget is funded at the expense of public services. Energy prices hit a record high in December\u202f2024, and Labour\u2019s popularity fell to 14\u202f% in polls. The Centre Party left the coalition, dropping from 13\u202f% in 2021 to 5.6\u202f%. St\u00f8re appointed former NATO Secretary\u2011General Jens\u202fStoltenberg as Finance Minister and introduced a \u201cNorway price\u201d of 0.4\u202fkroner per kWh, effective 1\u202fOctober. Trade Union Confederation (LO) leader Kine\u202fAsper\u202fVistnes praised the result, saying 'Our social model is based on freedom, equality, and solidarity, and it has proven itself well equipped to handle crises and transitions.' The article criticises the right\u2011wing parties for supporting NATO militarism and war, and portrays the new government as likely to deepen Norway\u2019s involvement in the conflict with Russia. It also quotes NHO head Ole\u202fErik\u202fAlmlid saying 'I am sure that ways can be found to cooperate well with both the Storting and government in the future.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 03:37 AM\nSource:[World Socialist](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/09/12/a006-s12.html)\n\n**Stoltenberg's Victory, Putin's Friends' Failure: What Norway's Elections Show**\nThe 8 September 2025 Norwegian parliamentary election saw the Labour Party win 53 seats, five more than before, but still short of the 85 seats needed for an outright majority.

The article frames the Progress Party\u2019s platform as \u2018ultra\u2011right\u2019 and criticises the Conservatives for failing to mobilise voters, describing the result as a \u2018failure\u2019 for them.

The Conservative Party fell to third place with 14.6\u202f% and 24 seats, a loss of 12 seats. The Socialist Left and Centre parties each secured 9 seats (5.6\u202f% of the vote). The Red\u2011Green bloc retained a majority, enabling a government. The Red Party won 5.3\u202f% and 9 seats; the Green Party increased to 8 seats with 4.7\u202f%. Christian Democrats and Liberal Party received 7 and 3 seats respectively. Turnout was 79.9\u202f%. Despite domestic shifts, Norway will continue to support Ukraine and enforce EU sanctions against Russia, driven by its role as a major energy supplier. The campaign focused on climate and energy, with the Green Party opposing new drilling projects. The article also critiques U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s approach, quoting him: 'We will send them [Ukraine] some Patriot complexes \u2013 they really need them.

St\u00f8re has promised that Ap will govern alone and will remain a guarantor of Norway\u2019s EEA and NATO memberships and of sound economic management.  He also pledged to seek broad consensus in parliament, but the article notes that cooperation with the other red\u2011green parties (SV, Sp, R\u00f8dt, MDG) will be negotiated on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis and may not be binding.  The opposition Conservative Party (H\u00f8yre) has lost influence, while the Progress Party (Frp) has gained 47 seats and is portrayed as a formidable opposition that will make life difficult for a minority\u2011governed Ap.  The author repeatedly stresses that the Labour Party\u2019s future will be shaped by \u201cthe many who will claw at it in the next four years\u201d and that the party must govern with humility.

Small parties could be decisive because only those surpassing the 4\u202f% threshold enter parliament; the current poll average gives the centre\u2011left 88 seats and the opposition 81. The Progress Party, founded in 1973 and now led by ultra\u2011right\u2011wing Sylvi\u202fListhaug, has doubled its support since 2021, when it received 11.6\u202f% of the vote. If the centre\u2011left wins, St\u00f8re is expected to remain prime minister for another four years; if the right wins, the next prime minister could be Listhaug or Conservative leader Erna\u202fSolberg. The election is framed by economic issues such as the high cost of living, taxes, electricity prices and management of Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. No party is expected to reach the 85 seats needed for an absolute majority, so the winner will likely govern in minority or form a coalition. The article notes that the \u2018efecto\u202fJens\u202fStoltenberg\u2019 \u2013 the boost from former NATO secretary\u2011general Jens\u202fStoltenberg\u2019s return to Norwegian politics \u2013 has helped the Labour Party gain ten points in recent polls. The article also highlights the broader international context, including the return of Donald\u202fTrump to the White House, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, and Norway\u2019s NATO membership and Arctic border with Russia.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 06:11 PM\nSource:[Sur](https://www.diariosur.es/internacional/europa/auge-ultra-amenaza-triunfo-izquierda-moderada-elecciones-20250906201143-ntrc.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All nine forecasting experts, each specializing in different domains of political science, sociology, election modeling, and Nordic studies, converge in their analysis that the Liberal Party (Venstre) did not win the most seats in the 2025 Norwegian parliamentary election. Their reasoning draws on official seat counts post-election, the Norwegian proportional representation system and its 4% threshold for leveling seats, and the party's historical underperformance. Venstre won only 2\u20133 seats with approximately 3.3\u20133.7% of the vote, well below major parties such as Labour, Progress, and Conservatives, all reports and media sources confirm. Experts emphasize that Venstre has never come close to being the largest party in modern Norwegian history and structural, sociological, and institutional factors make such an outcome virtually impossible. All consider a Yes resolution plausible only in the case of an extraordinary, evidence-free reporting or tally error, which no sources support. Every expert assigns a final probability of 0% that the Liberal Party won the most seats in the Storting in 2025, and their no-scenarios are realized in the official results. There is overwhelming consensus that the answer is a strict No.",
