He is currently incarcerated, faces unresolved legal controversies, and lacks the institutional or parliamentary support needed to become PM. The caretaker government under Sushila Karki is backed by both the Gen Z movement and establishment actors, with a clear and internationally supported mandate to prepare for elections. Historical and comparative base rates for populist or controversial figures ascending to the premiership in such caretaker/transition arrangements are very low. While Lamichhane has grassroots popularity and was briefly freed by protesters, the inertia of consensus politics, combined with his legal and political baggage, make his rapid elevation to PM before January 1, 2026, exceedingly unlikely barring an extraordinary collapse of the current order. News reports consistently highlight Karki\u2019s stability and mandate, with no credible reporting of an imminent shift to Lamichhane. Therefore, the probability that Rabi Lamichhane will be the next non-caretaker PM of Nepal before January 1, 2026 is extremely low, well below 5%.",

It warns that if elections cannot be organized within that period, Nepal could descend into a grave political and constitutional crisis. The article states, 'If elections cannot be organized in six months, Nepal could descend into a grave political and constitutional crisis.'

It identifies three main candidates: Balen Shah, Mayor of Kathmandu; Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar, a senior businessman and media founder; and Rabi Lamichhane, a media personality and party leader. The piece evaluates each candidate\u2019s strengths and risks. Balen Shah is described as an \"untainted outsider\" who mobilises youth but lacks broader governance experience and may alienate elites. Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is portrayed as a \"stable, moderate, and consensus\u2011oriented\" figure with strong business and diplomatic ties, though he has limited mass appeal. Rabi Lamichhane is noted for mass appeal and anti\u2011corruption rhetoric but faces legal controversies and credibility questions. The article concludes that Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is the most internationally palatable candidate for an interim prime minister, offering a balanced, neighbour\u2011friendly statesmanship. The analysis is supported by the article\u2019s own descriptions of each candidate\u2019s profile and the stated international perceptions of India, China, SAARC, and the EU.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[newsdrum.in](https://www.newsdrum.in/analysis/nepals-interim-pm-race-gen-z-icons-vs-the-consensus-dark-horse-10068653)\n\n**Gen Z's Gambit: Can Nepal's New Prime Minister Deliver?**\nThe article reports that the Sushila\u202fKarki\u2011led interim government, formed after the Gen\u202fZ revolution, has a six\u2011month mandate to hold elections.

The decision follows inconclusive talks between President Ramchandra Paudel, Gen\u2011Z protest representatives and the army. Karki, who has no party affiliation and a strong anti\u2011corruption record, was suggested by the protesters and will lead a caretaker government that will address their demands and organise fresh elections. She was born in Biratnagar in 1952, holds degrees in political science and law, and previously worked as a lawyer and assistant teacher. The move comes after former prime minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigned amid widespread Gen\u2011Z protests over corruption and a ban on social media, which led to at least 51 deaths. The article states, 'Karki will become the first woman to hold the office of prime minister in the country.' It also reports, 'Karki will be sworn in around 9pm on Friday.' and that, 'The caretaker government headed by former chief justice Karki will address the demands of Gen\u2011Z protesters and conduct fresh elections in the country hit by violent protests.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 07:23 PM\nSource:[The Week](https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2025/09/12/sushila-karki-to-lead-nepal-as-interim-pm-tasked-with-conducting-fresh-polls.html)\n\n**After Bangladesh and Sri\u202fLanka, Nepal\u2019s Youth Dismisses Its Political Class**\nThe article reports that on 8\u202fSeptember\u202f2024 a peaceful gathering in Kathmandu turned into an uprising that toppled Nepal\u2019s political elite, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Khadga\u202fPrasad\u202fSharma\u202fOli.  According to the piece, at least 72 people were killed and 2\u202f000 injured, and preliminary estimates put the damage at 2\u202fto\u202f20\u202fbillion euros.  The protests destroyed key state buildings \u2013 the Parliament, the Supreme Court, ministries, police stations, hotels and the headquarters of *The Kathmandu Post* \u2013 and set fire to the historic Singha\u202fDurbar complex.  A Ministry of Health employee lamented, \u2018I understand that the youth want change, but it is a mess, all the archives go up in smoke,\u2019 while a transport ministry official said, \u2018Do not confuse politicians with the buildings that serve the people.\u2019  The unrest was inspired by earlier youth\u2011led movements in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri\u202fLanka, and the article notes that the youth of Nepal, often called \u2018Nepo\u2011kids,\u2019 used TikTok and Discord to organize.  After the army imposed a curfew, the youth elected former Supreme Court chief Sushila\u202fKarki as prime minister via a Discord vote, a move described as \u2018the first government head elected on Discord.\u2019  The article quotes economist Raghu\u202fBir\u202fBista: \u2018Beyond the amounts, Generation\u202fZ burned symbols. This explosion reflects the feeling that to change the country, one must topple a gangrenous system.\u2019  It also highlights the country\u2019s economic woes \u2013 a GDP per capita of 1\u202f447\u202f\u20ac (the lowest in South Asia) and youth unemployment above 20\u202f% \u2013 and the frustration that drives many to consider emigration.  The piece concludes that the youth\u2019s rapid political mobilisation, though unprecedented, may lead to a new democratic era if the upcoming 2026 elections bring fresh representatives.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 03:57 PM\nSource:[Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/international/150925/apres-le-bangladesh-et-le-sri-lanka-la-jeunesse-du-nepal-congedie-sa-classe-politique)\n\n**Nepal's interim PM appoints cabinet amid post-protest recovery**\nIn an effort to stabilize Nepal after deadly anti\u2011government protests, Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the country\u2019s first female prime minister, appointed an interim cabinet on Monday.  The new ministers\u2014Kalman Gurung as energy minister, Rameshore Khanal as finance minister, and Om Prakash Aryal as home minister\u2014were sworn in outside a government building that had been attacked and set ablaze by protesters the week before.  The appointments come after violent demonstrations sparked by a brief social media ban and widespread anger over corruption that resulted in at least 72 deaths and hundreds of injuries, leading to the collapse of the previous administration.  Karki, 73, who was appointed on September\u202f12, took office following an agreement with leaders of the largely youth\u2011led \u2018Gen\u202fZ\u2019 protest movement.  The military, which enforced a curfew during the unrest, ultimately consented to her leadership of a caretaker government charged with overseeing elections within six months.  At a conference on Sunday, Karki stated, 'What we need now is to work to end corruption, bring about good governance, and achieve economic equality. This is what the people truly desire at this moment.'

Four names have emerged as potential candidates: Kathmandu mayor and rapper Balendra Shah 'Balen', former chief justice Sushila Karki, former chief of the electricity board Kulman Ghising, and current mayor of Dharan Harka Raj Sampang Rai. The scuffle on Thursday evening involved supporters of Balen, Karki or Sampang, according to multiple outlets. No final decision has yet been reached; talks are ongoing among Gen\u2011Z representatives, President Ram Chandra Paudel and the army chief. The President issued an appeal for calm and said he was doing his best to find a solution, with a letter seen as a signal to Gen\u2011Z representatives to 'take the onus and decide'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 11:19 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-nepal-get-new-leader-wait-extends-gen-z-cracks-what-we-know-so-far-101757588087511.html)\n\n**'Gen Z' protests: What's next for Nepal?**\nThousands of demonstrators in Nepal marched to demand the lifting of a social\u2011media ban that sparked a wave of anti\u2011corruption protests and led to the resignation of the prime minister on Tuesday. The protests, which have already claimed at least 19 lives, are dominated by Generation\u202fZ (born 1997\u20112012) and lack a single leader. The army has called for talks, but it is unclear whom the government can negotiate with. Constitutional expert Balaram\u202fKC said, 'Gen\u202fZ should set up a negotiation team,' and added that the president should then hold talks with that team, civil\u2011society members and the army. Under Nepal\u2019s 2015 constitution a successor must be chosen from the party with a parliamentary majority; if none exists the president appoints a candidate who can secure a majority and must win a confidence vote within 30\u202fdays. If that fails, the house may be dissolved and elections held. Experts such as Bipin\u202fAdhikari propose a temporary interim government that could pursue the reforms demanded by Gen\u202fZ and hold elections within six months. Potential leaders favored by the youth include Balendra\u202fShah, the 35\u2011year\u2011old mayor of Kathmandu elected in 2022, and Rabi\u202fLamichhane, a former TV journalist who founded the Rastriya\u202fSwatantra\u202fParty in 2022 and was reportedly freed from prison by protesters. The protesters also want a new constitution; while the 2015 charter allows amendments, they would need parliamentary approval.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 10:07 PM\nSource:[thedailystar.net](https://www.thedailystar.net/news/asia/south-asia/news/gen-z-protests-whats-next-nepal-3982931)\n\n**What next, Nepal?**\nThe article reports that after Prime Minister K\u202fP\u202fOli resigned on Tuesday, Nepal entered a power vacuum that the Nepal Army filled on Monday night.  Gen\u2011Z groups, notably Hami Nepal, held an hours\u2011long online discussion on Discord and voted to endorse former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as caretaker prime minister.  The Army chief, Ashokraj\u202fSigdel, was informed of the choice, while other Gen\u2011Z\u2011style groups\u2014including royalists and those who allegedly infiltrated the Monday\u2011night rally that killed 20 people\u2014were invited to meet at the army headquarters on Thursday.  Former National Human Rights Commissioner Mohna\u202fAnsari wrote on social media that \u201cFormer Chief Justice Sushila Karki is the best option to address the adverse circumstances prevailing in the nation\u201d and urged the President to act transparently.  The Constitution\u2019s Article\u202f273 allows the President to declare a state of emergency, which must be endorsed by a two\u2011thirds majority of Parliament within a month and would then last three months.  Analysts such as Krishna\u202fKhanal argue that a middle\u2011ground solution is needed, noting that the 2015 Constitution was the product of nearly a decade of negotiation and that a new charter could destabilise the country.  The article cites that 30 people died during the violent protests on Monday and Tuesday, and that 12 Gen\u2011Z\u2011style groups were involved in the discussions.  It also lists potential caretaker candidates\u2014Balen\u202fShah, Kulman\u202fGhising, Sumana\u202fShrestha\u2014and notes that Rabi\u202fLamichhane was released from jail on Tuesday after eight months of incarceration for embezzlement.  The piece concludes that Nepali youth must unite by Thursday to decide who will lead the country into the next phase.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 04:29 PM\nSource:[Nepali Times](https://nepalitimes.com/news/what-next-nepal)\n\n**Who will lead Nepal?

Soldiers have locked down Kathmandu and Bhaktapur; in Birgunj, a jailbreak attempt forced police to open fire. Inside Parliament, reporters found a charred skeleton of smashed windows and scorched history.

Constitutional expert Balaram K.C. said, 'Gen Z should set up a negotiation team,' and added that the president should then hold talks with the team, civil society members and the army. Under Nepal\u2019s 2015 constitution, a successor must come from the majority party or a member who can secure a majority and win a confidence vote within 30 days; if that fails, the house may be dissolved and elections held. Expert Bipin Adhikari suggested that an interim government could be created temporarily to represent protesters and hold elections within six months, saying, 'Such a government can pursue the agenda for change that Gen Z want and also hold elections for a new parliament within six months.' Potential leaders favored by protesters include Balendra Shah, the 35\u2011year\u2011old mayor of Kathmandu, and Rabi Lamichhane, a former journalist who was reportedly freed from prison.

The army has called on protesters\u2014mainly young people of Generation\u202fZ (born 1997\u20112012)\u2014to engage in talks, but the lack of a single leader complicates negotiations (article).

It identifies three main candidates: Balen Shah, Mayor of Kathmandu; Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar, a senior businessman and media founder; and Rabi Lamichhane, a media personality and party leader. The piece evaluates each candidate\u2019s strengths and risks. Balen Shah is described as an \"untainted outsider\" who mobilises youth but lacks broader governance experience and may alienate elites. Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is portrayed as a \"stable, moderate, and consensus\u2011oriented\" figure with strong business and diplomatic ties, though he has limited mass appeal. Rabi Lamichhane is noted for mass appeal and anti\u2011corruption rhetoric but faces legal controversies and credibility questions. The article concludes that Bhaskar Raj Rajkarnikar is the most internationally palatable candidate for an interim prime minister, offering a balanced, neighbour\u2011friendly statesmanship. The analysis is supported by the article\u2019s own descriptions of each candidate\u2019s profile and the stated international perceptions of India, China, SAARC, and the EU.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[newsdrum.in](https://www.newsdrum.in/analysis/nepals-interim-pm-race-gen-z-icons-vs-the-consensus-dark-horse-10068653)\n\n**Indians Stranded In Kathmandu As Nepal Remains On The Boil**\nViolence erupted across Nepal on Tuesday, even after the resignation of President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and three ministers. Demonstrators set fire to the Parliament, the President's Office, the PM's residence, the Supreme Court, political party offices and homes of senior leaders. At least 19 people were killed in Monday's protests by Gen Z over corruption and a government ban on social media, which was lifted Monday night. A mob set a house belonging to former prime minister Jhala Nath Khanal on fire in Dallu; his wife Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar sustained serious burn injuries and later died at Kirtipur Burn Hospital. The Supreme Court building, Singhdurbar, the President's Office at Maharajgunj and the PM's residence at Baluwatar were also set ablaze. The Kantipur Television office in Tinkune, as well as police posts at Gaushala, Lubhu and Kalimati, were vandalised and set on fire. The house of former prime minister and Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba in Budhanilkantha was also torched. Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balen Shah urged calm and called for talks with the Army chief, but insisted Parliament must be dissolved first. Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman Rabi Lamichhane was released from jail; a party leader said, 'Since the administration said they could not provide security and asked the family to take responsibility, his family took charge,' according to My Republica. Meanwhile, a few Telugu families of Indian origin were stranded in Kathmandu; they had been staying at a top hotel but were moved to a nearby guest house after agitators knocked on the doors. An official from Andhra Pradesh Bhavan said, 'We are in constant touch with the Embassy of India in Kathmandu and coordinating through local representatives to safeguard the welfare of these families.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 03:51 PM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/india/indians-stranded-in-kathmandu-as-nepal-remains-on-the-boil-ws-l-9560811.html)\n\n**Nepal Protests: Buzz Over Oli's Successor Builds, But No Clarity On Frontrunners**\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday after violent protests that killed 19 people and targeted his residence. The protests were sparked by a ban on 26 social media apps, including Instagram, Facebook and X. The violence also saw the burning of Oli\u2019s home in Bhaktapur and stone\u2011throwing at the residences of Deputy Prime Minister Bishnu Paudel and Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Biswo Paudel. In the same week, 21 MPs from Rabi Lamichhane\u2019s Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) resigned, heightening the political crisis. Lamichhane, a former home minister and media personality, is seen as a potential successor, but his ability to lead depends on his release from jail. Another possible contender is Balendra \u201cBalen\u201d Shah, the independent Mayor of Kathmandu, who has publicly supported the Gen\u2011Z protests and urged that the movement remain non\u2011partisan. The situation remains volatile, with sources saying clarity may emerge in the next 24\u201348 hours. The article cites a quote from Shah: 'The rally is clearly a spontaneous movement of Gen\u2011Z... I give my full support.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 09:39 AM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/world/nepal-protests-buzz-over-olis-successor-builds-but-no-clarity-on-frontrunners-ws-l-9559687.html)\n\n",
    "date": "2025-10-13T16:51:35.693702",
    "summary": "All experts assign an extremely low probability (1-2%) to Rabi Lamichhane becoming the next non-caretaker prime minister of Nepal before January 1, 2026. The consensus reasoning is as follows: Lamichhane is currently or was recently incarcerated on legal charges (embezzlement/fraud), raising significant constitutional and credibility challenges to his eligibility for office. Although he enjoys some anti-establishment and Gen-Z-driven grassroots support, institutional, military, elite, and international actors are aligned behind an interim, consensus caretaker (Sushila Karki) with a specific mandate to hold elections by March 2026. The caretaker government, parliamentary dissolution, and lack of majority support for Lamichhane\u2014exacerbated by the mass resignation of RSP MPs\u2014further diminish his prospects. The experts recognize that only a dramatic collapse of the caretaker order and rapid legal exoneration could re-open a path, but see no compelling evidence for such a scenario. Historical and regional base rates for imprisoned or legally embattled outsiders becoming PM under similar circumstances are viewed as near zero. All experts therefore conclude that Lamichhane's chances are exceedingly remote, with the status quo heavily favoring stability and established process over populist disruption within the short resolution window.",
