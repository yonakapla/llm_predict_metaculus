The more plausible path is via the LDI: sustained illiberal governance (e.g., repeated election subversion, suppression of media and civil society, unchecked executive power, politicized courts, and erosion of checks and balances) could drive the LDI below 0.5.

However, the US has more robust civil society, media, federalism, and institutional inertia than most recent backsliding cases, making a total collapse less likely. The most plausible No scenario is a further slide into illiberalism, but this would require sustained, unchecked erosion without corrective movements for nearly a decade. Given the US's history of self-correction, robust institutions, and structural advantages, the probability of maintaining both HDI and LDI criteria by 2034 remains high, though not overwhelmingly certain.

        "title": "Will the United States remain a highly developed liberal democracy in 2035?",
        "description": "This question assesses the United States' status as a developed, liberal democracy through two key lenses: human development and the health of its democratic institutions.\n\nHuman Development Index (HDI): This UN index is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: health, education, and standards of living. The HDI combines statistics on life expectancy, mean and expected years of schooling, and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita to rank countries into four tiers of human development. As of the 2025 report (with data for 2023), the United States' HDI score is 0.938, ranking it 17th and placing it firmly in the \u2018very high human development\u2019 category.\n\nLiberal Democracy Index (LDI): This V-Dem Institute index measures the quality of a country\u2019s democratic institutions. For the data year 2024, the United States' LDI score is 0.75, ranking 24th of 179. The LDI is constructed by combining two major indices: the Electoral Democracy Index (measuring free elections and freedoms of expression and association) and the Liberal Component Index (measuring checks on the executive and protections for individual liberties).\n\nThe United States' resilience is anchored in its position as the world's largest economy, a highly innovative technology sector, and a long tradition of constitutional governance. However, this foundation is under unprecedented strain. The V-Dem Institute's 2025 Democracy Report notes that the country's Liberal Democracy Index (LDI) registered a substantial and statistically significant decline compared to its 2014 level and describes the current situation as a potential \"democratic breakdown in the making\". The report highlights that the latest data only covers events until December 31, 2024, and therefore does not capture the most recent developments. Key challenges fueling this democratic erosion include attacks on the rule of law and the judiciary, the purging of civil servants to install loyalists, and increasing pressure on media freedom. These trends are exacerbated by what the V-Dem report characterizes as \"toxic levels\" of political polarization in the US. This question asks whether the United States will successfully navigate these severe challenges to meet the criteria for a highly developed, liberal democratic nation, defined by clear HDI and LDI thresholds.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following conditions are met for the calendar year 2034. If either or both conditions are not met, it will resolve as No.\n\nHuman Development Index (HDI): According to the first official publication of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report that includes data for the year 2034, the United States must be placed in the top 50 list of high human development countries.\n\nLiberal Democracy Index (LDI): According to the V-Dem Institute's dataset released in 2035 (containing data for the year 2034), the United States' score on the Liberal Democracy Index must be 0.500 or higher.",

American democracy is unlikely to collapse under Donald Trump\u2019s influence, citing economic and longevity indicators that historically protect democracies.\n\u2022 It references Seymour Martin Lipset\u2019s 1959 observation that wealth increases the likelihood of democratic resilience, and Adam Przeworski\u2019s 2005 finding that nations richer than Argentina in 1976 survived a thousand years of democracy.\n\u2022 A 2020 study identified only three types of states with per\u2011capita income above $36,000: democracies, oil states, and Singapore, underscoring the rarity of such wealth.\n\u2022 A 2005 statistical analysis showed that democracies lasting more than 50 years with per\u2011capita income over $23,000 had a 0\u202f% chance of failure, a figure the author notes was adjusted to 2025 values.\n\u2022 The piece also cites the Varieties of Democracy database, which records 30 democratic backsliding cases between 2000 and 2019, of which only eight led to collapse.\n\u2022 The author concludes that a prosperous civil society can withstand authoritarian pressures, arguing that the United States, with its long history, wealth, and robust institutions, is well positioned to endure Trump\u2011era challenges.\n\u2022 Evidence: Lipset\u2019s 1959 claim that wealth correlates with democratic survival; Przeworski\u2019s 2005 observation that richer nations survived beyond 1000 years; 2020 study limiting high\u2011income states to democracies, oil states, and Singapore; 2005 study linking >50\u2011year longevity and >$23,000 per\u2011capita income to 0\u202f% failure; Varieties of Democracy data showing 30 backsliding cases, 8 collapses.\n\u2022 The article uses data to support its thesis, but frames the U.S. as uniquely resilient, reflecting a political stance that the U.S. democracy will survive Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 09:00\n\nSource: DIE WELT\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: 1\nReporting voice:

book *Upheaval*, argues that national crises can be managed by applying individual psychological tools such as flexibility, honest self\u2011appraisal, and selective change.\n\u2022 He cites the U.S. political polarization as the main threat to social cohesion and suggests that recognizing the crisis, taking responsibility, and making selective changes can restore democracy.\n\u2022 Yair Zivan, in *The centre must hold*, identifies polarization as a global issue and promotes centrism\u2014compromise, moderation, pragmatism\u2014as a solution.\n\u2022 He claims that populist solutions are ineffective while liberal centrists can offer balanced policies.\n\u2022 Political scientist Francis Fukuyama, a critic of classical liberalism, warns that extreme right, left, neoliberal, populist, and progressivist movements threaten liberal institutions and that a moderated, adaptive liberalism can protect rights and rule of law.\n\u2022 The essay concludes that fully functioning societies, like fully functioning individuals, must be open, flexible, and self\u2011trusting to resist rigid ideologies and achieve growth.\n\u2022 The author repeatedly uses the phrase 'The centre must hold' to emphasize the need for a balanced political stance.\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 07:38\n\nSource: Medium.com\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: 0\nReporting voice:

the Dominican Republic, higher economic growth has not led to stronger democratic confidence.\n\u2022 It cites that when Juan Bosch was elected president on 20\u202fDecember\u202f1963, the GDP was less than US$4\u202fbillion, and when the armed revolt in 1965 occurred, GDP was still below US$5\u202fbillion, suggesting that a poor population defended its democracy.\n\u2022 The author references a sociological axiom that material improvement should increase social consciousness and strengthen state institutions, but claims the opposite has happened.\n\u2022 When Rafael Trujillo rose to power in 1930, the economy was in ruin, customs were controlled by the United States, and days after his inauguration Santo\u202fDomingo was destroyed by Cyclone San\u202fZen\u00f3n.\n\u2022 The article states that a GDP above US$120\u202fbillion should correspond to a consolidated democratic space, compared to the less than US$3\u202fbillion figure when the tyrant was executed.\n\u2022 It then traces GDP growth: Leonel\u202fFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s first term saw GDP rise to US$21\u202fbillion, falling to US$19\u202fbillion by the end of Hip\u00f3lito\u202fMej\u00eda\u2019s term, before spiking to nearly US$100\u202fbillion in subsequent PLD and PRM administrations, and now exceeding US$120\u202fbillion.\n\u2022 This economic expansion is presented as the reason why the three branches of government\u2014judiciary, constitutional court, public ministry, electoral bodies, and municipal powers\u2014operate with relative independence.\n\u2022 Despite an average growth of more than 5\u202f%, a per\u2011capita income of almost US$10\u202fk, and foreign\u2011exchange earnings of US$43\u202fbillion annually, the article finds it inexplicable that most citizens lean toward force regimes rather than democracy, posing the question, \u2018What is happening?\u2019.\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 06:00\n\nSource: El Nacional\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment:

The article argues that the United States is once again at a critical crossroads, echoing the Civil War era, and that the current division dominates politics.\n\u2022 Historian Heather Cox Richardson is cited as saying we have \"always been divided\" and that today \"that division dominates our politics.\" The piece warns of a drift toward authoritarianism, drawing on the work of Harvard professor Steven Levitsky and University of Toronto scholar Lucan A.\n\u2022 Way, who predict that by the end of Trump\u2019s second term America could \"cease to meet standard criteria for liberal democracy.\" It highlights Trump\u2019s use of the 1918 Sedition Act and the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts as historical precedents for stifling dissent, and notes his recent push to manipulate the census to exclude undocumented immigrants.\n\u2022 The author calls for vigilance, citing George Orwell\u2019s *1984* and *Animal Farm* and Aldous Huxley\u2019s *Brave New World* as warnings against the erosion of truth and democratic norms.\n\u2022 The article concludes that protecting democracy requires active, critical thinking, echoing Benjamin Franklin\u2019s caution that a republic is only viable if \"you can keep it.\".\n\nPublished date: September 27 2025, 17:09\n\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Analytical\nContinent: North

American Democrats are not unusually soft on crime.\n\u2022 Using homicide data, it shows that metropolitan areas\u2014many of which are Democratic\u2011controlled\u2014have lower homicide rates than rural, Republican\u2011controlled counties.\n\u2022 For example, Shreveport, Louisiana, reports 20.5 murders per 100\u202f000 residents; Baton\u202fRouge, Louisiana, 18.7; Mobile, Alabama, 17.6; and Rocky\u202fMount, North Carolina, 15.6\u2014each ranking among the country\u2019s 14 most dangerous metro areas.\n\u2022 In contrast, rural counties in South Carolina have a rate of 17.5 per 100\u202f000, and the author estimates that about 16 states exhibit a similar pattern.\n\u2022 The piece notes that if federal crime\u2011fighting followed data rather than politics, National Guard troops would be deployed to places like Memphis, yet also to the Republican\u2011led metros above.\n\u2022 It points out that Memphis\u2019s homicide rate is the lowest in six years, yet it faces a military occupation.\n\u2022 The author cites that Los\u202fAngeles has spent more than $100\u202fmillion on National Guard deployments, arguing that evidence\u2011based community\u2011safety programs would be more effective.\n\u2022 The article is written by Ian\u202fAyres and Jacob\u202fSlaughter of Yale Law School (Project\u202fSyndicate).\n\u2022 The author quotes the article\u2019s own words: 'Los enfoques de estas ciudades para el crimen basados en evidencia requieren recursos federales, no rifles federales' and 'm\u00e1s de $100 millones gastados hasta ahora en despliegues de la Guardia Nacional'.\n\nPublished date: September 26 2025, 14:37\n\nSource: perfil.com\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: 0\nReporting voice: Analytical\nContinent: North America\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation key: [10]\nTitle: Har USA passert middagsh\u00f8yden?\n\nKey Points: \n\u2022 The article \"Har USA passert middagsh\u00f8yden?\" is a Norwegian debate piece that argues the United States may have peaked and is heading downward, with consequences for Europe and Scandinavia.\n\u2022 It discusses several themes:\n1. **Increased polarization** \u2013 citing Store\u202fNorske\u202fLeksikon, the article notes that American politics have become more extreme since the 2000s, with Democrats moving left and Republicans right, a trend accelerated by Trump\u2019s 2016 election.\n2. **Pressure on university autonomy** \u2013 referencing NRK\u202fUrix 17.4.25, it claims the Trump administration has sought oversight over admissions, hiring and political views, threatening funding and foreign\u2011student intake, potentially harming academic freedom.\n3. **Fake news** \u2013 again citing Store\u202fNorske\u202fLeksikon, the piece explains how misinformation has spread, noting that the term \"Fake News\" surged after Trump\u2019s first term and has been used as a political slur.\n4. **US\u2011Israel relations** \u2013 the article asserts that a powerful Israeli lobby and Trump\u2019s policies have strained Middle\u2011East dynamics, potentially isolating the US.\n5. **Changed foreign policy** \u2013 citing Store\u202fNorske\u202fLeksikon, it describes Trump\u2019s shift from multilateral agreements to bilateral deals, tariff use, reduced humanitarian aid, and demands for higher NATO contributions.\n6. **US constitution and gun violence** \u2013 quoting the article\u2019s own words, it states: 'I 2015 var det rundt et skytev\u00e5pen pr person i USA' and 'I 2021 d\u00f8de ca 47\u202f000 personer etter \u00e5 ha blitt skutt, selvdrap inkludert.' These figures illustrate the high prevalence of firearms and gun\u2011related deaths.\n7. **Erosion of democracy and rule of law** \u2013 the piece claims that presidential orders are increasingly unchecked, undermining checks and balances, and that the National Guard is used to enforce presidential directives.\n8. **Implications for Norway and Scandinavia** \u2013 it argues that European and Nordic countries must become more self\u2011reliant, citing Norway\u2019s need to strengthen total defence and the importance of NATO membership for Sweden and Finland.\n\u2022 The article is opinion\u2011laden, uses strong language, and presents a clear political stance, making it subjective and moderately provocative.\n\nPublished date: September 26 2025, 09:52\n\nSource: nordnorskdebatt.no\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Subjective\nContinent: Europe\n\n</doc>\n\n------News Summaries End------\n"

the Dominican Republic, higher economic growth has not led to stronger democratic confidence.\n\u2022 It cites that when Juan Bosch was elected president on 20\u202fDecember\u202f1963, the GDP was less than US$4\u202fbillion, and when the armed revolt in 1965 occurred, GDP was still below US$5\u202fbillion, suggesting that a poor population defended its democracy.\n\u2022 The author references a sociological axiom that material improvement should increase social consciousness and strengthen state institutions, but claims the opposite has happened.\n\u2022 When Rafael Trujillo rose to power in 1930, the economy was in ruin, customs were controlled by the United States, and days after his inauguration Santo\u202fDomingo was destroyed by Cyclone San\u202fZen\u00f3n.\n\u2022 The article states that a GDP above US$120\u202fbillion should correspond to a consolidated democratic space, compared to the less than US$3\u202fbillion figure when the tyrant was executed.\n\u2022 It then traces GDP growth: Leonel\u202fFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s first term saw GDP rise to US$21\u202fbillion, falling to US$19\u202fbillion by the end of Hip\u00f3lito\u202fMej\u00eda\u2019s term, before spiking to nearly US$100\u202fbillion in subsequent PLD and PRM administrations, and now exceeding US$120\u202fbillion.\n\u2022 This economic expansion is presented as the reason why the three branches of government\u2014judiciary, constitutional court, public ministry, electoral bodies, and municipal powers\u2014operate with relative independence.\n\u2022 Despite an average growth of more than 5\u202f%, a per\u2011capita income of almost US$10\u202fk, and foreign\u2011exchange earnings of US$43\u202fbillion annually, the article finds it inexplicable that most citizens lean toward force regimes rather than democracy, posing the question, \u2018What is happening?\u2019.\n\nPublished date: September 28 2025, 06:00\n\nSource: El Nacional\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment:

The article argues that the United States is once again at a critical crossroads, echoing the Civil War era, and that the current division dominates politics.\n\u2022 Historian Heather Cox Richardson is cited as saying we have \"always been divided\" and that today \"that division dominates our politics.\" The piece warns of a drift toward authoritarianism, drawing on the work of Harvard professor Steven Levitsky and University of Toronto scholar Lucan A.\n\u2022 Way, who predict that by the end of Trump\u2019s second term America could \"cease to meet standard criteria for liberal democracy.\" It highlights Trump\u2019s use of the 1918 Sedition Act and the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts as historical precedents for stifling dissent, and notes his recent push to manipulate the census to exclude undocumented immigrants.\n\u2022 The author calls for vigilance, citing George Orwell\u2019s *1984* and *Animal Farm* and Aldous Huxley\u2019s *Brave New World* as warnings against the erosion of truth and democratic norms.\n\u2022 The article concludes that protecting democracy requires active, critical thinking, echoing Benjamin Franklin\u2019s caution that a republic is only viable if \"you can keep it.\".\n\nPublished date: September 27 2025, 17:09\n\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Analytical\nContinent: North America\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation key: [9]\nTitle: \u00bfSon realmente blandos con el crimen los dem\u00f3cratas estadounidenses?\n\nKey Points: \n\u2022 An article from perfil.com argues that American Democrats are not unusually soft on crime.\n\u2022 Using homicide data, it shows that metropolitan areas\u2014many of which are Democratic\u2011controlled\u2014have lower homicide rates than rural, Republican\u2011controlled counties.\n\u2022 For example, Shreveport, Louisiana, reports 20.5 murders per 100\u202f000 residents; Baton\u202fRouge, Louisiana, 18.7; Mobile, Alabama, 17.6; and Rocky\u202fMount, North Carolina, 15.6\u2014each ranking among the country\u2019s 14 most dangerous metro areas.\n\u2022 In contrast, rural counties in South Carolina have a rate of 17.5 per 100\u202f000, and the author estimates that about 16 states exhibit a similar pattern.\n\u2022 The piece notes that if federal crime\u2011fighting followed data rather than politics, National Guard troops would be deployed to places like Memphis, yet also to the Republican\u2011led metros above.\n\u2022 It points out that Memphis\u2019s homicide rate is the lowest in six years, yet it faces a military occupation.\n\u2022 The author cites that Los\u202fAngeles has spent more than $100\u202fmillion on National Guard deployments, arguing that evidence\u2011based community\u2011safety programs would be more effective.\n\u2022 The article is written by Ian\u202fAyres and Jacob\u202fSlaughter of Yale Law School (Project\u202fSyndicate).\n\u2022 The author quotes the article\u2019s own words: 'Los enfoques de estas ciudades para el crimen basados en evidencia requieren recursos federales, no rifles federales' and 'm\u00e1s de $100 millones gastados hasta ahora en despliegues de la Guardia Nacional'.\n\nPublished date: September 26 2025, 14:37\n\nSource: perfil.com\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: 0\nReporting voice: Analytical\nContinent: North America\n\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\nCitation key: [10]\nTitle: Har USA passert middagsh\u00f8yden?\n\nKey Points: \n\u2022 The article \"Har USA passert middagsh\u00f8yden?\" is a Norwegian debate piece that argues the United States may have peaked and is heading downward, with consequences for Europe and Scandinavia.\n\u2022 It discusses several themes:\n1. **Increased polarization** \u2013 citing Store\u202fNorske\u202fLeksikon, the article notes that American politics have become more extreme since the 2000s, with Democrats moving left and Republicans right, a trend accelerated by Trump\u2019s 2016 election.\n2. **Pressure on university autonomy** \u2013 referencing NRK\u202fUrix 17.4.25, it claims the Trump administration has sought oversight over admissions, hiring and political views, threatening funding and foreign\u2011student intake, potentially harming academic freedom.\n3. **Fake news** \u2013 again citing Store\u202fNorske\u202fLeksikon, the piece explains how misinformation has spread, noting that the term \"Fake News\" surged after Trump\u2019s first term and has been used as a political slur.\n4. **US\u2011Israel relations** \u2013 the article asserts that a powerful Israeli lobby and Trump\u2019s policies have strained Middle\u2011East dynamics, potentially isolating the US.\n5. **Changed foreign policy** \u2013 citing Store\u202fNorske\u202fLeksikon, it describes Trump\u2019s shift from multilateral agreements to bilateral deals, tariff use, reduced humanitarian aid, and demands for higher NATO contributions.\n6. **US constitution and gun violence** \u2013 quoting the article\u2019s own words, it states: 'I 2015 var det rundt et skytev\u00e5pen pr person i USA' and 'I 2021 d\u00f8de ca 47\u202f000 personer etter \u00e5 ha blitt skutt, selvdrap inkludert.' These figures illustrate the high prevalence of firearms and gun\u2011related deaths.\n7. **Erosion of democracy and rule of law** \u2013 the piece claims that presidential orders are increasingly unchecked, undermining checks and balances, and that the National Guard is used to enforce presidential directives.\n8. **Implications for Norway and Scandinavia** \u2013 it argues that European and Nordic countries must become more self\u2011reliant, citing Norway\u2019s need to strengthen total defence and the importance of NATO membership for Sweden and Finland.\n\u2022 The article is opinion\u2011laden, uses strong language, and presents a clear political stance, making it subjective and moderately provocative.\n\nPublished date: September 26 2025, 09:52\n\nSource: nordnorskdebatt.no\nClassification: Politics\nSentiment: -1\nReporting voice: Subjective\nContinent: Europe\n\n</doc>\n\n------News Summaries End------\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse range of disciplinary perspectives\u2014including governance assessment (Freedom House and V-Dem methodologies), American political development, democratic consolidation theory, comparative politics (Polity Score and systems theory), sociology (modernization and social capital theories), and economics (human development and institutional economics)\u2014experts converge on a strong but not absolute consensus: The United States is very likely to remain a highly developed liberal democracy in 2035, with all but two forecasts falling between 83% and 93% probability, a mean around 87%, and the modal estimate at 85%.\n\nAll forecasters agree that, as of 2025, the US comfortably meets both resolution criteria (HDI top 50 and LDI >= 0.5), and maintain that the base rates, structural wealth, deep institutional roots, and adaptive capacity make outright collapse exceedingly rare for countries with the US's profile. Recurring themes that drive high probability outcomes are the extraordinary resilience seen in long-established, wealthy democracies, the inertia of human development and liberal-democratic indices, and the US's robust economic and institutional endowments. The Human Development Index (HDI) is almost universally regarded as safe from falling below the threshold short of highly improbable shocks (war, civil conflict, systemic economic collapse).\n\nHowever, all experts acknowledge notable and, in some estimations, unprecedented risk stemming from increasing polarization, observable democratic backsliding, challenges to the rule of law, executive overreach, and pressure on media and civil society. The most plausible path to a No resolution is sustained and unchecked governance erosion, especially under repeated or prolonged illiberal administrations, potentially driving the LDI below 0.5 within a decade. Still, experts emphasize that the extent of drop required (from 0.75 to below 0.5) is considerable and rarely observed in advanced democracies without war or coup.\n\nForecasters highlight adaptive features\u2014strong civil society, federalism, institutional inertia, and periodic correctives\u2014as key buffers that make full breakdown unlikely. While risk is clearly higher than in past decades, no expert sees outright failure as the base case. In sum, all perspectives point to a high-likelihood Yes outcome (HDI and LDI thresholds maintained), tempered by modest but real concern about the unique combination of contemporary US risks. The aggregate expert judgment is that the US remains a highly developed liberal democracy in 2035 with high but not complete confidence.",
