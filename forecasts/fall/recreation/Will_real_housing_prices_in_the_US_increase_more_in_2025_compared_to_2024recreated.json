Rising inventory, seller price reductions, and longer time on market signal a weak bargaining position for sellers. Although there is a late-2025 uptick in new-home sales, this appears driven by discounts rather than true appreciation, and national data (e.g., S&P Case-Shiller, FHFA, Zillow) show real price growth lagging inflation. With CPI still running near 2.7% and home price growth at or below that level, it's unlikely that real appreciation will accelerate compared to 2024. The most probable outcome is that 2025 sees weaker, not stronger, real price growth than 2024. Downside risk is further enhanced by ongoing economic uncertainty, policy volatility, and a shift toward a more buyer-friendly market.",

The caution around not going all the way to zero is also justified: there\u2019s always some tail risk of a Fed overcorrection or sudden inflation drop, but these are remote.

The idea that 'status quo is sticky' in the absence of a shock is true, but you underplay how quickly macroeconomic headwinds erode even the most stubborn price resistance. The last two decades of housing data show that once affordability craters and inventory rises, even the stickiest sellers eventually capitulate, leading to real price declines or stagnation, not a surprise reacceleration. You should put less weight on behavioral inertia and more on the cold realities of monetary transmission, supply/demand, and regional drag.

The observation that any late-2025 new-home sales surge is a mirage driven by discounts, not true appreciation, is exactly what a behavioral economist would highlight as a framing effect rather than real value creation. The sociological lens is dead-on in noting that only select, wealthier segments are keeping prices afloat in certain metros, but this is nowhere near enough to move the national ZHVI needle.

Your probability (17%) is a hair lower than mine, but the focus on 'extraordinary migration' or 'supply interruptions' as necessary for a Yes outcome is misplaced\u2014right now, the only thing that could plausibly flip the script is a Fed-induced mortgage rate crash or an economic shock, not some migration trend.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe United States housing market has experienced significant fluctuations over the past few decades. After recovering from the 2008 financial crisis, which was largely triggered by the subprime mortgage collapse, housing prices saw steady appreciation throughout the 2010s. This trend accelerated dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by historically low interest rates, limited housing inventory, and changing work patterns. Nominal house prices fell slightly at the end of 2022, but have been rising since.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the [Zillow Home Value Index](https://www.zillow.com/research/methodology-neural-zhvi-32128/)\n\n> is designed to capture the value of a typical property across the nation or the neighborhood, not just the homes that sold, and we do so by drawing information from the full distribution of homes in a given region.\n> \u00a0\n> ZHVI measures monthly changes in property-level Zestimates, capturing both the level and appreciation of home values across a wide variety of geographies and housing types (e.g., all single-family homes in ZIP code 98101). This is how we focus on actual market price changes, and not changes in the kinds of markets or property types that sell from month to month.\n\nCheck the link for some details on their methodology.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":31271,\"question_id\":30916}}`",

The price per square foot fell 0.5% from a year ago for the second consecutive week, ending nearly two years of consistent growth.  Realtor.com economist Jiayi Xu notes, 'The weak sales activity has finally caught up and stalled out this metric, suggesting underlying home values are starting to soften.'  Mortgage rates have eased toward the lower end of 6%, yet 81% of existing mortgages remain locked below 6%, and the average 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate ticked up to 6.3% from 6.26% the week before.  New listings fell 1.9% year\u2011over\u2011year, the second decline since April\u202f2025, while the total number of active listings rose 16.4% from a year ago, reaching 1.1\u202fmillion homes and marking the 98th consecutive week of annual gains.  The typical for\u2011sale home waited seven days longer than the same period in 2024, reflecting a slight slowdown.  Despite these challenges, Xu predicts the fall will still be the most buyer\u2011friendly market in nearly a decade, offering a potential sweet spot if rates and prices stabilize.  Regional differences persist, with the West and South experiencing higher inventory and slower pace compared to tighter conditions in the Midwest and Northeast.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 09:15 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/home-values-starting-erode-weak-211539114.html)\n\n**America's housing market now worth $55 trillion  --  after growing 57% in just 5 years. How to still find a deal**\nThe article reports that the U.S. housing market reached a record value of $55.1\u202ftrillion in June\u202f2025, a $20\u202ftrillion (57\u202f%) increase since 2020, according to Zillow.  Housing wealth grew 1.6\u202f% over the past year, but the pace has slowed compared with the 2020\u20112022 boom.  Growth is uneven: the Northeast, especially New\u202fYork, added $216\u202fbillion in one year, while Florida, Texas and California have cooled, partly due to higher home\u2011insurance and property\u2011tax costs linked to climate\u2011change\u2011driven disasters.  Mortgage rates have risen from 2.65\u202f% in January\u202f2021 to a peak of 7.79\u202f% in October\u202f2023, and were 6.2\u202f% in September\u202f2024, with the average 30\u2011year rate at 6.26\u202f% on September\u202f18\u202f2025.  New York\u2019s inventory is half of pre\u2011pandemic levels, whereas the Sun Belt has seen new construction create pockets of affordability.  Zillow\u2019s home\u2011value index shows a median sale price of $373,333 and an average of $363,505 as of late August\u202f2025.  The Federal Reserve Bank of St.\u202fLouis reports a Q2\u202f2025 median price for new single\u2011family homes at $410,800, with regional variations: $796,700 in the Northeast, $385,300 in the Midwest, $372,100 in the South and $531,100 in the West.  An Associated Press report notes the market has been sluggish since early\u202f2022, with high prices and high mortgage rates discouraging buyers.  Inventory has grown for almost two years, but supply recovery has slowed; the South and West saw the largest gains.  Sellers are increasingly pulling listings, with a 57\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year rise in delistings in July.  The article concludes that while some markets may be shifting toward a buyer\u2019s market, high mortgage rates remain a major hurdle, and economists expect rates to stay near the mid\u20116\u202f% range this year.  \"High prices coupled with high mortgage rates\" is a key phrase used to describe the current climate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 08:15 PM\nSource:[Aol](https://www.aol.com/finance/americas-housing-market-now-worth-201500318.html)\n\n**Existing-home sales in August were the lowest in 10 years**\nAccording to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing\u2011home sales in August 2025 slowed to an annualized rate of 4\u202fmillion homes, the lowest monthly level in at least a decade. The seasonally adjusted rate was 1.8\u202f% higher than a year earlier, but actual sales were 0.8\u202f% lower than August 2024, as noted by Bright\u202fMLS chief economist Lisa\u202fSturtevant.

The median price rose 2\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year to $422,600. NAR\u2019s chief economist Lawrence\u202fYun said, 'Home sales have been sluggish over the past few years due to elevated mortgage rates and limited inventory,' and added, 'However, mortgage rates are declining and more inventory is coming to the market, which should boost sales in the coming months.' Sturtevant warned that the methodology might overstate strength, saying, 'Based on actual sales, August Existing\u2011Home Sales were down 0.8 percent from a year ago and are at their lowest August level in at least 10 years.' Jason\u202fWaugh of Coldwell\u202fBanker Affiliates noted, 'While summer is traditionally considered peak season for homebuying, Q4 emerged as the most active period last year, driven by declining mortgage rates in Q3,' and said a similar trend may be unfolding this year.

Low mortgage rates and work\u2011from\u2011home policies spurred a buying boom in the first two years of the pandemic, but rates shot up in 2022, slowing new purchases while keeping prices high for those who locked in low rates.  The median monthly payment on a home bought in 2024 was $2,207, up from $1,525 in 2021, and the median sales price for existing single\u2011family homes rose 56% between February\u202f2020 and July\u202f2024.

Smith said the surge \"broke out of their summer slump\" and \"marked the strongest pace of 2025 so far.\"  The median sales price climbed to $413,500, up 4.7% from July\u2019s $395,100 and roughly 2% higher than a year earlier.  For\u2011sale inventory fell to 490,000 homes, a 1.4% drop from July\u2019s 497,000, giving a 7.4\u2011month supply\u2014down 17.8% from July\u2019s nine\u2011month estimate and 9.8% lower year\u2011over\u2011year.  \"The supply of new homes tightened notably as buyers stepped back into the market,\" Smith noted, adding that one in five homes for sale were not yet started and about one quarter were completed, moving toward pre\u2011pandemic norms.  NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes said the month\u2019s figures may be revised downward but overall sales are expected to improve as mortgage rates decline.  NAHB senior director Jing Fu highlighted that the average 30\u2011year fixed mortgage rate fell 32 basis points to 6.26%, the lowest since early October 2024, and that this trend, coupled with the Fed\u2019s rate cut to 4%\u20114.25%, should boost demand in the final quarter of 2025.  Regional data showed all four U.S. regions grew in August, with the Northeast leading at a seasonally adjusted 72.2% increase from July and a 41% year\u2011over\u2011year rise; the South grew 24.7% monthly and 21% yearly; the Midwest 12.7% monthly and 20.3% yearly; and the West 5.6% monthly but a 5.7% decline year\u2011over\u2011year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 06:14 PM\nSource:[RISMedia](https://www.rismedia.com/2025/09/24/new-homes-sales-clock-surprising-20-surge-for-summers-end/)\n\n**Homebuilders Just Pulled Off a Shocking Comeback--Here's What Sp**\nUS new\u2011home sales jumped 20.5% in August to an annualized rate of 800,000 units, the fastest pace since early 2022, according to government data released Wednesday. The surge beat every forecast in Bloomberg\u2019s survey. Builders are leaning heavily on incentives: Lennar, for example, recently offered concessions equal to 14.3% of its average sale price, more than double its typical range. A National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo survey found 39% of builders cut prices this month, the highest rate since the pandemic. The inventory of new homes for sale fell to 490,000 units, the lowest level this year, reflecting a significant dent in the lingering oversupply. Mortgage rates slid to their lowest level in a year, creating a window of opportunity for buyers. The median sales price rose to $413,500, supported by stronger activity at the high end of the market, particularly in homes priced above $1\u202fmillion. Sales were higher across all regions, with the South posting its best level since March\u202f2021. The data lifted homebuilder stocks, but affordability concerns remain: buyers still face high price levels and financing costs, and broader labor\u2011market uncertainty adds hesitation. Analysts note that new\u2011home sales data, based on contract signings, provides a more immediate read on demand than existing\u2011home sales, which will be updated by the National Association of Realtors on Thursday. The government highlighted the volatility of monthly figures, noting a 90% confidence range that spanned from a modest decline to a more than 40% surge, suggesting investors should treat August\u2019s jump as a possible but not definitive turning point.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 05:24 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3119150/homebuilders-just-pulled-off-a-shocking-comebackheres-what-sparked-it)\n\n**Housing Market Report No.\u202f18 in Collaboration with Statec**\nThe 18th edition of the joint publication \"Logement en chiffres\" by the Observatoire de l'habitat and Statec reports a sharp rebound in Luxembourg\u2019s residential real\u2011estate market in the second quarter of 2025.  Activity for existing apartments rose 72.9\u202f% and for existing houses 93.7\u202f% compared with Q2\u202f2024, while construction\u2011market transactions jumped 126\u202f% \u2013 yet still only half the pre\u2011crisis average (2017\u20112021).  Prices for all housing types increased 4.5\u202f% in Q2\u202f2025 versus Q2\u202f2024, approaching the long\u2011term annual trend of +5.0\u202f% over 2010\u20112025.  The report notes that price changes are based on notarised sales recorded in Q2\u202f2024, \"les actes notari\u00e9s enregistr\u00e9s au 2e trimestre 2024\", and that the forthcoming Q3\u202f2025 data will be crucial to assess whether the activity surge will reverse.\n\nOver the past decade the market has grown, with annual apartment sales rising from 4,794 units (2007\u20112010) to 7,130 units (2018\u20112021).  Growth has been uneven, with downturns during the 2008 financial crisis, the COVID\u201119 pandemic, and the 2022 interest\u2011rate hike, which particularly dampened new\u2011construction activity.  Seasonal peaks in Q4 are often triggered by fiscal or regulatory changes, such as the 2014 VAT increase and energy\u2011efficiency reforms, or the 2017\u20112018 capital\u2011gain tax cuts.\n\nQ2\u202f2025 saw a record 1,575 sales of existing apartments \u2013 the highest since 2007 \u2013 while the VEFA (construction) market remained subdued.  The report attributes this to a stronger demand for existing stock rather than supply constraints, raising concerns about long\u2011term supply resilience.\n\nThe publication also discusses the upcoming reform of the property\u2011tax law (project law no.\u202f8082).  The new model will incorporate average travel time to Luxembourg City, rather than straight\u2011line distance, as a key variable in the hedonic pricing model.  \"Le temps de trajet sera int\u00e9gr\u00e9 au mod\u00e8le h\u00e9donique lors du changement de base de l\u2019indice des prix immobiliers pr\u00e9vu pour juin\u202f2026\", the report states.\n\nRental market data show a 0.7\u202f% quarterly decline and a 2.2\u202f% annual drop in advertised apartment rents for Q2\u202f2025, while inflation in consumer prices returned to long\u2011term averages (+1.9\u202f% from Q2\u202f2024 to Q2\u202f2025).

While the national average masks regional variation, several markets still posted gains: West Virginia rose 5.7% and South Dakota 6.2%. Across the country, 50% of markets continued to see price increases, mainly in more affordable Mid\u2011West metros such as Chicago, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Tulsa, Louisville, Philadelphia and the New\u202fYork metro. Conversely, Florida and Western markets experienced persistent declines, with Los\u202fAngeles dropping 0.03% from June to July and Washington\u202fD.C. falling 0.2% from July\u202f2024 to July\u202f2025. In the 100 largest metros, half saw price declines, a reversal of the typical 0.4% July rise seen from 2015\u20112019. The median single\u2011family home price reached $405,000, and buyers now need roughly $200,000 more than a decade ago to close on a median\u2011priced home. Inventory is growing, yet affordability remains a hurdle; mortgage rates are at their lowest since last September, which, combined with lower home prices, is expected to improve affordability for buyers who have been on the sidelines. Investor purchases account for about one\u2011third of total home sales, a share that is projected to stay steady through 2025. Cotality\u2019s Chief Economist Dr. Selma Hepp noted, 'Lower mortgage rates and home prices in many markets suggest improved affordability for a number of buyers who have been sitting on the sidelines for a long time.' She added, 'July's decline in home prices is atypical -- the last two periods where we saw monthly declines in July was in 2022 and during 2006\u20112008 period -- but this year's decline follows a year of relatively flat home prices and persistent weakness in homebuying demand.'

According to Realtor.com, the median listing price nationwide in July rose slightly to 43\ub9cc 9450\ub2ec\ub7ec (about 610\u202fmillion KRW).  However, the number of existing\u2011home sales fell 1.3\u202f% compared with the first seven months of the previous year, and the 7\u2011month period last year was already at a 30\u2011year low.  Mortgage rates, which had been historically low, began climbing in 2022, and a 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgage is now projected at 6.74\u202f%.  With a 20\u202f% down payment and the remaining balance financed at that rate, the article notes that \"7 of 10 prospective buyers would have to give up on purchasing a home,\" illustrating the sharp decline in buyer demand.\n\nSellers in the South and West are actively reducing prices and offering incentives such as lower mortgage rates, prepaid interest, and covering closing costs to attract buyers.  For example, a retired couple in Evergreen, Colorado, lowered the asking price of a 4\u2011bed, 4.5\u2011bath single\u2011family home from 130\ub9cc \ub2ec\ub7ec (1.3\u202fmillion USD) to 128\ub9cc \ub2ec\ub7ec (1.28\u202fmillion USD) after no showings.  In Austin, Texas, the median listing price fell 4.9\u202f% from a year ago, while in Miami it fell 4.7\u202f%.  Chicago, Los Angeles, and Denver saw price declines of 4.4\u202f% to 4.0\u202f%.  Despite these reductions, inventory has risen 21 consecutive months, a 25\u202f% increase over the previous year, and Austin\u2019s inventory has grown nearly 60\u202f% compared with pre\u2011pandemic levels.\n\nThe article quotes the sentiment that \"\uc9d1\uc744 \uc0ac\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc26c\uc6cc\uc84c\ub2e4,\" reflecting the perception that buying has become easier, yet the overall market remains in a slump, with sellers feeling pressured to lower prices and buyers facing higher borrowing costs.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 12:38 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250908_0003320763)\n\n**US home prices see annual gains, but lag behind inflation**\nU.S. home prices rose modestly in June and over the second quarter of 2024, yet the gains lagged behind inflation.  According to the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, prices increased 2.9\u202fpercent from Q2\u202f2024 to Q2\u202f2025 and were flat between the first and second quarters of 2025.  The S&P Cotality Case\u2011Shiller Index reported a 1.9\u202fpercent year\u2011over\u2011year rise in national home prices for June, the slowest pace in two years.  Consumer inflation, measured by the CPI, climbed 2.7\u202fpercent during the same period, outpacing the 1.9\u202fpercent gain in home prices.  Nicholas Godec of S&P Dow Jones noted that the 1.9\u202fpercent gain masks volatility: the first half of the year saw a 0.6\u202fpercent decline, offset by a 2.5\u202fpercent surge in the most recent six months, indicating a significant inflection point around early 2025.  Godec added that this is the first time in years that home prices have not kept pace with inflation, marking a historically significant reversal.  The 20\u2011City Composite grew 2.1\u202fpercent and the 10\u2011City Composite 2.6\u202fpercent; cities such as Tampa and Phoenix saw price declines, while New York and Chicago posted gains of 7\u202fpercent and 6.1\u202fpercent respectively.  Across 100 major metros, 81 experienced price increases, with Rochester seeing the largest 10.3\u202fpercent rise and North Port\u2011Bradenton\u2011Sarasota the largest 11.2\u202fpercent decline.  Regionally, the Middle Atlantic division led with a 6.7\u202fpercent increase, whereas the Pacific division grew only 0.9\u202fpercent.  Bright MLS Chief Economist Lisa Sturtevant cautioned that slower price growth and falling mortgage rates may attract more buyers, but inventory has risen above pre\u2011pandemic levels, potentially leading to decelerating growth and even year\u2011over\u2011year drops in some markets this fall.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 03:15 PM\nSource:[Inman](https://www.inman.com/2025/08/26/us-home-prices-see-modest-annual-gains-but-lag-behind-inflation/)\n\n**U.S. Housing Prices Expected to Rise Slightly, but Key Markets See Stronger Gains**\nZillow, the U.S. real\u2011estate platform, has repeatedly revised its forecast for national home\u2011price growth. The company originally projected a 2.6\u202f% rise by the end of 2025, but in April the estimate was cut to a -1.7\u202f% decline. In its latest report, Zillow now projects a modest 0.4\u202f% increase over the next 12 months, indicating a slight easing of the earlier acceleration. Despite the national slowdown, Zillow identifies 10 metropolitan areas that are expected to see stronger price gains between 2025 and 2026. The average U.S. home price remains high at $367,965, a figure that continues to challenge many buyers. Nevertheless, 27 U.S. cities are currently offering favorable or neutral conditions for home purchasers, largely due to builders responding to demand and boosting supply. Markets that historically attracted high demand\u2014such as Florida and Texas\u2014are experiencing significant inventory growth, which could improve affordability. In summary, while the broader U.S. housing market faces headwinds, certain regions are still posting notable price increases and others are easing, giving buyers a mixed landscape to navigate.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 24, 2025 08:20 PM\nSource:[El Diario Nueva York](https://eldiariony.com/2025/08/24/alertan-sobre-aumento-en-los-precios-de-viviendas-en-ciudades-clave/)\n\n**US housing market sees rising inventory, slower price growth and more negotiation room**\nThe US housing market is showing signs of cooling, with rising inventory, slower price growth, and more negotiation room for buyers. According to Realtor.com, Zillow, and RE/MAX, the number of homes actively for sale has increased dramatically, with a 28.9% jump in June compared to the same time last year. This is the 20th consecutive month of annual inventory growth, signaling a shift away from the pandemic-era frenzy. Mike Opyd, a broker with RE/MAX Premier, said, 'For the last few years, sellers have held off listing their properties mainly because they were not sure what to do if the home sold. The thought of losing their historically low rate to pay one that is double was extremely challenging for them to grasp.' With more homes available and buyers slowing down their pace, sellers are adjusting expectations, with 20.7% of active listings having price reductions in June, according to Realtor.com. Homes are also taking longer to sell, with the typical home spending 53 days on the market in June, up from 48 days a year ago. Prices have not fallen dramatically, with the national median listing price of $440,950 in June essentially flat from a year ago. The rise in inventory means more options, less competition, and greater opportunity to negotiate for buyers, but also presents challenges for sellers, who will need to focus on competitive pricing, proper staging, and flexible negotiation strategies to stand out in a crowded field.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 04:15 PM\nSource:[Atlanta Agent Magazine](https://atlantaagentmagazine.com/2025/08/01/us-home-inventory-rising-2025/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=us-home-inventory-rising-2025)\n\n**US Housing Market Sees Slowdown in Growth, Uncertain Future Ahead**\nAccording to the Zillow Home Value Index, the US housing market saw a 0.2% increase in June compared to the same period last year, a significant slowdown from the 3.2% growth in the previous 12 months. ResiClub's analysis of Zillow's report found that the number of US housing markets with declining prices increased from 31 in January to 80 in March and 110 in June. Many metropolitan areas are experiencing declining housing prices, including Austin, Texas, which saw a 5.8% year-over-year decline, and Tampa and Miami, Florida, which saw 5.7% and 3.8% declines, respectively. However, in areas with low inventory, such as the Northeast and Midwest, prices are still rising, but at a slower pace. Andy Walden, vice president of research and analysis at Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), said that the slowdown in growth is partly due to sellers being reluctant to list their properties, as many homeowners view their homes as their largest financial asset. If prices continue to decline, homeowners may delay selling to avoid losses, leading to reduced inventory and a stagnant housing market. According to Realtor.com, housing inventory has increased significantly in 2025, with active listings rising from 829,000 in January to nearly 1.1 million in June. Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi attributed the current situation to the continued rise in mortgage rates, saying that 'although housing growth has remained good, it is changing because prices have plateaued and are likely to decline, a 7% impact on demand, and more homes are being locked in, depending on their economic and employment situation.' He warned that this could further affect prices, as well as housing construction and sales, and that 'housing will soon become a more comprehensive obstacle to overall economic growth, and we have more and more reasons to worry about the economic outlook later this year and early next year.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: July 23, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/7/23/n14559169.htm)\n\n**Brazilian Residential Real Estate Market Ends First Half of 2025 with 3.33% Appreciation**\nThe Brazilian residential real estate market ended the first half of 2025 with a significant appreciation. Between January and June, the prices of homes for sale rose by an average of 3.33% in the 56 cities monitored by the FipeZAP Index. This surpasses the official consumer inflation rate measured by IPCA, which was 3.01%, and contrasts with the deflation of 0.94% measured by IGP-M, the so-called rental index. According to economist Paula Reis, the appreciation rate showed a slight deceleration compared to the same period last year, when the FipeZAP Index had risen by 3.56%. 'Comparing with the IPCA variation, the real appreciation of prices also decreased, as the accumulated inflation until June 2024 was 2.5% and the accumulated until June 2025 is 3.01%. This signals that the moment is one of adjustment in the market, influenced by the increase in the Selic rate and the depletion of housing savings resources, which have increased the cost of mortgage credit,' she says. The economist also evaluates that, for the next months, the trend is one of moderation in the pace of price increases: 'With more restricted financing, the demand for homes is losing strength, reducing the pressure on prices and indicating a more contained trend for the second semester, whose expectation is a more expensive and selective credit scenario.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/minhas-financas/valorizacao-dos-precos-de-imoveis-residenciais-chega-a-333-no-1o-semestre/)\n\n**US Housing Market Faces Pressure from High Mortgage Rates and Economic Uncertainty**\nThe US housing market is facing pressure due to high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) released its June housing market index report, which showed a decline in builder confidence to its lowest level in 2.5 years. The NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI) fell to 32 in June, down from 34 in May and 43 a year ago. The decline in HMI is attributed to high mortgage rates and policy uncertainty. NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes said, 'Homebuyers are increasingly holding back due to high mortgage rates, tariffs, and economic uncertainty. To alleviate the burden on homebuyers and attract hesitant buyers, more builders are adopting price-cutting strategies.' NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz noted, 'As inventory levels rise, potential homebuyers are delaying purchases, leading to a slowdown in price appreciation and a decline in resale prices in many markets.' According to the report, 37% of US builders have adopted price-cutting strategies in June, up from 34% in May and 29% in April, setting a new record high since NAHB's monthly tracking began in 2022. The average price cut is stable at 5%, matching the adjustment level of each month since November 2024. Meanwhile, the usage rate of sales incentives has risen to 62%, up 1 percentage point from May, indicating that the industry is strengthening its efforts to stimulate demand through pricing. Based on the current market environment, NAHB predicts a decline in single-family housing starts in the US in 2025. The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting is also closely watched, as it will release its latest policy statement and economic and interest rate forecasts. Markets expect the Fed to maintain its benchmark overnight rate at 4.25% to 4.50% for the fourth consecutive time since December last year. Analysts and investors are paying close attention to the Fed's Economic Projections Summary (SEP), which is expected to reveal changes in the Fed's views on the economy since the last round of projections in March. Some analysts suggest that the Fed may lean towards a more hawkish stance, given its emphasis on controlling inflation and the potential impact of Trump's new tariffs on prices. Morgan Stanley's chief US economist, Michael Feroli, noted, 'Trade policy changes may lead to a significant adjustment in the Fed's projections, with growth slowing and inflation rising by more than expected in March. Although this type of stagflation correction does not point to a clear direction, we expect it to be slightly hawkish, with the number of rate cuts this year reduced to one.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 18, 2025 01:08 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202506183434061870.html)\n\n**Affordable Housing Index Continues to Decline, New Homes to be More Expensive due to Tariffs**\nThe Affordable Housing Index continues to decline, and new homes will be more expensive due to tariffs. According to Leslie Adames, Director of Analysis and Economic Policy at Estudios T\u00e9cnicos Inc., the index fell from 58% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 53% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the average value of the index was 57% at the end of the year, compared to 65% the previous year. 'There is no doubt that the problem of affordability is deepening and that is worrying, especially when the figure shows that people interested in obtaining a mortgage loan only had 57% of the required income by financial institutions to qualify,' Adames said. The Affordable Housing Index, prepared by ETI, measures the ability of a typical family to qualify for a mortgage loan with a 20% down payment. A value of 100% indicates that a family has the necessary income to obtain financing at the average price of housing. Values below this threshold reflect difficulties in accessing the purchase of a home. Adames noted that, although the fixed 30-year mortgage interest rate decreased from 7.06% in May to 6.72% in December, it remains high compared to the 4.04% average recorded in the pre-pandemic period. 'The fact that the long-term interest rate continues to experience upward pressure and that the lack of housing inventory in the real estate market persists does not suggest space for normalization of affordability to pre-pandemic levels when the average value of the index was 84% considering the period from 2011 to 2019. It is worth remembering that during this period, a low-interest rate environment prevailed in the market and there was still housing inventory. This is no longer the case!' Adames said. According to data from the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, the average price of new units sold increased by 18.4% annually to $367,716 in 2024, while used units increased by 12.8% to $212,811. In terms of sales, the market recorded a 7.5% reduction in the number of units sold, with a total of 9,996 units in 2024, representing 814 fewer units compared to 2023. 'In the short term, it is not predictable that there will be stabilization in the prices of housing units. We have already seen pressure on prices due to the insufficiency of housing and the increase in the cost of construction materials. Now the pressure on construction material costs is exacerbated, not only by the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imposed by the Trump Administration at the beginning of the year, but also by the possibility of this tariff increasing by 50% as announced by President Trump this week,' Adames said.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[periodicovision.com](https://periodicovision.com/el-indice-de-vivienda-asequible-continua-bajando-y-las-casas-nuevas-seran-mas-caras-por-los-aranceles/)\n\n**US Housing Market Shifts as High Interest Rates and Economic Uncertainty Take Hold**\nThe US housing market is experiencing a significant shift due to high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Buyers now have more negotiating power, forcing sellers to offer concessions. According to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index, home prices in the 20 major metropolitan areas fell 0.12% in March, breaking the sustained upward trend since January 2023. The biggest change is in the supply: 117,000 new, unsold single-family homes were recorded in April, the highest level since July 2009, representing a 31% year-over-year increase. Almost half of sellers are offering incentives to close deals, and the inventory is at its highest point since September 2020. The luxury market is also affected, with a 10% decline in sales compared to the previous year. Even cash buyers and those accessing large loans are showing caution, reflecting a general loss of confidence. This has led many people, including the top 5% of earners, to keep their money in money market funds rather than investing in real estate. Texas leads the list of markets with an oversupply, with 123,000 properties for sale, a 53% increase from normal levels. In Austin, home values have fallen 20.4% since the pandemic peak. Florida also shows signs of correction, particularly in cities like Tampa and Jacksonville. In California, the Bay Area faces a significant gap between new listings and properties in the sales process. According to Quartz, the uncertainty goes beyond interest rates: it's also about confidence. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has urged the Federal Reserve to reduce rates to ease the pressure on the market. Companies like Redfin and Zillow predict that prices will continue to fall slightly in the coming months. Despite the price drop, many potential buyers remain on the sidelines, while homeowners with low-interest mortgages resist selling, leaving the market in a state of paralysis between high supply and contained demand.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 12:06 AM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/mundo/2025/6/2/mercado-inmobiliario-de-eu-sobreoferta-de-vivienda-desploma-precios-539046.html)\n\n**Its a Seller\u2019s Market as Home Prices Rising Across the United States (but Can Anyone Afford Them?) - Transcript Daily**\nAccording to the Standard & Poors CoreLogic Case\u2011Shiller US National Home Price Index, U.S. home prices rose nearly 6\u202f% over the 12\u202fmonths ending March\u202f2024, reaching a 33\u2011month high and the strongest growth rate in roughly three years. The 20\u2011city index shows Seattle leading with a 12.3\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year gain, Portland and Dallas also posting record gains, while New\u202fYork recorded the smallest gain at 4.1\u202f%. Minneapolis experienced the largest month\u2011over\u2011month rise at 1.3\u202f%, whereas Tampa and Cleveland saw declines. Home values are climbing at more than double the pace of average hourly earnings, making affordability harder for buyers. S&P Dow Jones Indices managing director David\u202fBlitzer said, 'Over the last year, analysts suggested that one factor pushing prices higher was the unusually low inventory of homes for sale. People are staying in their homes longer rather than selling and trading up.' He added, 'If mortgage rates, currently near 4\u202f%, rise further, this could deter more people from selling and keep pressure on inventories and prices.' Blitzer also noted, 'While prices cannot rise indefinitely, there is no way to tell when rising prices and mortgage rates will force a slowdown in housing.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 30, 2017 03:21 PM\nSource:[transcriptdaily.com](https://transcriptdaily.com/2017/05/30/its-a-sellers-market-as-home-prices-rising-across-the-united-states-but-can-anyone-afford-them.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a strong consensus that the probability of US real housing prices increasing more in 2025 compared to 2024 is low. Experts from real estate analysis, economics (across multiple subfields), urban studies, and sociology all highlight similar headwinds: rising inventory, persistent affordability challenges, elevated mortgage rates (despite some easing), and regional divergence with weakness in large Sun Belt and Western markets offsetting resilience in the Northeast and Midwest. Builder incentives and recent upticks in new-home sales provide only marginal and likely unsustained support, as these are often achieved through price concessions rather than underlying demand strength. Inflation continues to outpace modest nominal price growth, making real price appreciation challenging nationally. Sociological and behavioral perspectives emphasize systemic barriers for lower-income and first-time buyers, as well as buyer hesitancy and seller resistance to nominal cuts; all reduce the likelihood of broad-based acceleration in real house price growth.\n\nMost experts cite historical base rates: after the kind of rapid appreciation and subsequent stalling experienced in 2024, further acceleration in real prices is rare barring major positive shocks (e.g., sharp drops in rates or macroeconomic surprises), which are considered unlikely given current trends and policy signals. Probabilities assigned to a 'Yes' outcome (real price growth in 2025 outpacing 2024) range from 15% to 30%, with the majority clustering between 17% and 23%. The scenario for a 'Yes' resolution uniformly requires unexpectedly sharp mortgage rate declines or a nationwide demand surge\u2014outcomes several experts describe as improbable. The consensus view is that 2025 will see continued stagnation or slight deceleration in real housing price growth relative to what was already a flat or near-zero real increase in 2024.",
