While legitimacy and elite consensus perspectives add nuance, none suggest an imminent breakdown. Given that the most informed and relevant lenses (legal-institutional and coalition arithmetic) strongly reinforce my initial high estimate, and that the group consensus is clustered in the 80-90% range, I see no reason to reduce my probability. In fact, the deliberation marginally increases my confidence that the true risk of a sudden ouster is even lower than initially estimated, but not enough to warrant a bump to 90%, as the corruption scandal risk remains nonzero.",

The constructive vote of no confidence, lack of a credible alternative government, and coalition partners\u2019 aversion to early elections make a last-minute leadership change extremely unlikely barring an unprecedented scandal directly implicating S\u00e1nchez himself.

However, some defenses of even higher probabilities (85-90%) underplay the elevated, though still minority, risk that ongoing investigations or further revelations could produce a sudden coalition defection or internal crisis. Given the short time left and the historical resilience of Spanish minority governments, but also acknowledging that the current scandal context is more acute than generic base rates would suggest, I will nudge my probability upward slightly to reflect the consensus and the time constraint, while still recognizing the nontrivial risk.

Multiple experts, especially those with deep expertise in Spanish constitutional law and parliamentary mechanics, argue convincingly that the constructive vote of no confidence is an almost insurmountable barrier absent a complete coalition breakdown or direct, game-changing evidence implicating S\u00e1nchez himself. While the corruption scandals and coalition instability increase headline risk, no credible evidence has surfaced of imminent coalition defection, and the timeline for orchestrating a successful censure is extremely tight. The most persuasive critiques target the underweighting of the status quo and the overemphasis on generic 'fragility.' As such, the tail risk of a sudden collapse is smaller than I initially assessed, and a modest upward revision is justified to better reflect the strong inertia of Spanish institutions and party dynamics.",

The critique of forecasts with lower probabilities (in the 70s) is persuasive: the time remaining is very short, coalition partners\u2014even if restive\u2014have not shown signs of defection, and Spain's system is deliberately designed to weather precisely this kind of scandal- and gridlock-driven turbulence. My initial emphasis on legitimacy erosion and coalition fragility remains valid but is perhaps overweighted given the historical and institutional context. The defense of elite theory, coalition theory, and constitutional barriers all suggest a base rate closer to the mid-80s is warranted, especially as there's been no new evidence of imminent collapse.

He called for consensus with Madrid and openness to other parties, stressing that the PSOE\u2011Madrid project must be shared with the \"immense majority of citizens\".  L\u00f3pez framed his political vision around the optimism of the \"history of progress and solidarity\", insisting on a positive approach to problems while warning that he would not leave \"any trope\" unanswered.

The meeting follows the party\u2019s January leadership change and is scheduled amid the approaching Andalusian parliamentary elections expected in June 2026.

The format will mirror previous sessions: Montero will deliver an opening address to the press, after which the meeting will proceed behind closed doors.  This will be the second Director Committee gathering since Montero\u2019s appointment, the first having taken place on 16 May 2025 in San Juan de Aznalfarache, where she announced the party\u2019s shift to an \u2018offensive and action\u2011oriented\u2019 stance to regain control of the Junta and drive a \u2018deep transformation\u2019 of Andalusia.  Montero has emphasized that the party\u2019s \u2018change\u2019 is underway and that the Executive has drafted a work plan with sector\u2011specific priorities, which the party will now implement step by step.  The PSOE\u2011A has reiterated that the Director Committee meets twice a year, and the upcoming meeting marks the start of a political campaign cycle.  In the same Friday session, the party\u2019s Regional Lists Commission was activated to prepare for candidate lists ahead of the next elections, signalling readiness for the eventual call by the current PP\u2011A president, Juanma Moreno.  Montero also opened the political cycle with an Interparliamentary meeting on 5 September in Montilla and a public opening event in M\u00e1laga on 14 September alongside Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who praised the party\u2019s candidate for the Junta as embodying \u2018what Andaluc\u00eda needs\u2019 and \u2018what it will have after the elections\u2019 with \u2018passion, commitment, closeness and work\u2019, while also \u2018always looking left\u2019.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 12:14 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/andalucia/noticia-montero-convoca-comite-director-psoe-segunda-vez-ano-elecciones-andaluzas-horizonte-20250915141455.html)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez Calls PSOE to Be the 'Compass' That 'Inspires' Others**\nOn 15\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, Pedro\u202fS\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s president and secretary\u2011general of the PSOE, addressed lawmakers in Madrid, claiming that Spain \"works thanks to social\u2011democratic recipes\" and urging his party to remain a \"compass\" for other social democracies amid a perceived collapse of the traditional right. He praised the government\u2019s performance since 2018 and said that Spanish social democrats are \"the first representatives of a renewed social democracy that will open a path in Europe in the coming years.\" S\u00e1nchez warned that the traditional right has \"mimetized\" itself with the far right, lacking proposals and resorting to insults, and that the party must \"govern with effectiveness\" and keep ambition.

The gathering, which S\u00e1nchez typically calls a few times a year, comes at a pivotal moment in the legislature. After the imprisonment of Santos Cerd\u00e1n\u2014who had been a key ally on the presidential podium in recent sessions\u2014and ongoing investigations into alleged corruption involving Ferraz and the Ministry of Transport, the party faces an increasingly complex relationship with its coalition partners. According to PSOE sources, the meeting aims to set the agenda for the coming months within the parliamentary framework. The government seeks to regain legislative momentum to carry the legislature through to 2027, but it remains far from an agreement with its partners to approve the first General State Budgets of this term. Sources close to the president also anticipate a possible rollback of some measures intended to curb corruption. The meeting follows one of the largest parliamentary defeats the executive has suffered this legislature, when the parliament voted against reducing the workweek to 37.5 hours.

He also spoke on the Israel\u2011Gaza conflict, pledging support for \"movilizaciones por las causas justas\" while stressing Spain\u2019s role as a human\u2011rights example.  The speech targeted the opposition, accusing the PP of \"el ruido y los insultos\" and calling its leader a \"mala copia de Abascal\".

The debut comes at the start of a new political cycle, a period that is particularly delicate for Prime Minister Pedro\u202fS\u00e1nchez. S\u00e1nchez faces mounting pressure from corruption allegations involving close associates: two former PSOE Organization secretaries have been indicted, one of them, Santos\u202fCerd\u00e1n, is in prison; his wife, Bego\u00f1a\u202fG\u00f3mez, and brother, David\u202fS\u00e1nchez, are also under investigation for alleged corruption. David\u202fS\u00e1nchez is awaiting trial, while G\u00f3mez\u2019s case is still in the investigative phase. Additionally, the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office are increasingly dissatisfied with S\u00e1nchez\u2019s criticism of judges investigating his circle. Legislatively, the government is fragile, heavily reliant on support from independentist partners, which hampers the passage of key measures such as the General State Budget. S\u00e1nchez continues to govern with the 2023 accounts extended, acknowledging that presenting a new 2026 budget is practically impossible, yet he insists he will not call early elections.

An investigation by the Civil Guard has implicated former Socialist Party Secretary of Organization Santos Cerd\u00e1n, a close ally of S\u00e1nchez, in a suspected bribery scheme. This has further damaged the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), which is already embroiled in a corruption scandal involving former Secretary of Organization and former Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos and his advisor Koldo Garc\u00eda. The scandal has now spread to the region of Navarra, which is governed by the Socialists, after a high-ranking local official resigned due to his ties with Cerd\u00e1n and alleged corrupt practices in public works contracts. The main opposition party, the conservative Popular Party (PP), believes that the scandal could bring down the government. Its leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, describes the PSOE as a party in a state of destruction and considers the situation to be a major crisis. S\u00e1nchez's coalition partners, including Sumar (a left-wing party) and regional nationalists, are also distancing themselves from the PSOE. Sumar's Vice President Yolanda D\u00edaz has warned S\u00e1nchez that there will be a 'problem' in Spain if the PSOE is not cleaned up and measures are not taken to address corruption. Meanwhile, the government remains committed to completing its term in 2027, with Vice President Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero stating that they have 'plenty of reasons' to continue and will continue to seek support to pass legislation. Montero has also acknowledged that the PSOE's apology for corruption is not enough and that more measures are needed to regain trust. 'We have plenty of reasons to continue the legislature and we will keep looking for support to legislate,' Montero said.

He challenged the opposition to present a motion of censure, rather than demanding early elections. The Prime Minister announced a series of measures in response to the resignation of Santos Cerd\u00e1n, the PSOE's secretary of Organization, who was accused of managing illegal commissions for his predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos.

S\u00e1nchez appeared before the press after a long meeting of his party to make changes following a police report pointing to the third-ranking member of the party, Santos Cerd\u00e1n, for taking bribes in exchange for public contracts. Cerd\u00e1n resigned as secretary of organization of the PSOE on Friday and as a deputy on Monday, while former minister and S\u00e1nchez's former right-hand man, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, was expelled from the party on Monday. S\u00e1nchez defended his party's swift response and again ruled out resigning or calling early elections. 'The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party is a clean organization,' S\u00e1nchez said. 'We won't cover up corruption that arises within our ranks, no matter how painful it is.'

He challenged the conservative and far-right opposition to present a motion of censure, rather than demanding early general elections. S\u00e1nchez appeared before the press at the Socialist Party (PSOE) headquarters to announce a series of measures following the resignation of all his party's positions held by Santos Cerd\u00e1n, who is suspected of managing illegal commissions for his predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, and a helper in the awarding of public works, according to a police judicial report. S\u00e1nchez insisted that 'possible corruption of a few will have to be substantiated in the courts', also referring to \u00c1balos, the former Socialist Organization Secretary and former Transport Minister, investigated by the Supreme Court since November 2024 and expelled definitively today from the PSOE. He also emphasized that the police report cited does not make any allegations about irregular financing of his party. S\u00e1nchez ruled out presenting a confidence motion to check if Parliament maintains its support for him to continue as head of government and reaffirmed that he will not make any changes to the government, formed by a coalition of left-wing parties and which he valued for its 'cleanliness'. He added that he will meet with parliamentary groups that supported him in 2023 to be re-elected as Prime Minister after the general elections in July of that year. Yolanda D\u00edaz, the second vice-president of the Executive and leader of the Sumar movement, considered S\u00e1nchez's explanations 'insufficient' and demanded measures of democratic regeneration and the absolute cleanliness of all corners of power and the PSOE that may have been involved in the alleged corruption scheme. 'It's not true, corruption is not inevitable. Enough of cynicism!', exclaimed the politician of Sumar. The Basque Nationalist Party, one of the parliamentary partners of the government, also demanded 'greater contundency and transparency'. S\u00e1nchez began to govern in mid-2018 precisely after winning a motion of censure against the then-conservative government, just after the Supreme Court condemned the PP for a corruption case. Among the PSOE measures in these circumstances, the Organization Secretary will have a provisional collegiate direction until the meeting of the Socialist Executive Direction on July 5, when S\u00e1nchez will propose who will succeed the resigned Santos Cerd\u00e1n. There will be a new external audit to review the party's accounts and the results will be published. S\u00e1nchez will appear in Congress to give 'all' the explanations and the Socialist parliamentary group will propose a parliamentary commission of investigation to know the truth of the case. In the opposition, the PP spokesperson, Borja S\u00e9mper, demanded an immediate parliamentary appearance by S\u00e1nchez and argued that a motion of censure would be a 'breath of fresh air' for S\u00e1nchez, in the belief that his parliamentary partners of the left and nationalists and independentists from the Basque Country and Catalonia would not let him fall. On the other hand, the leader of Vox (far-right), Santiago Abascal, offered the deputies of his party for a motion of censure with the aim of winning it and calling for immediate elections. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 11:43 PM\nSource:[El Nacional](https://www.elnacional.com/mundo/adelanta-las-elecciones-lo-que-dijo-pedro-sanchez-en-su-ultima-comparecencia-en-la-que-reto-a-la-oposicion/)\n\n**Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez Reiterates No Early Election Before 2027**\nDespite corruption allegations, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has reiterated that there will be no early election before 2027.

S\u00e1nchez will appear in Congress to give 'all' the explanations and the socialist parliamentary group will propose a parliamentary commission of investigation to know the truth of the case.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 12:44 PM\nSource:[www.diariolibre.com](https://www.diariolibre.com/mundo/europa/2025/06/16/pedro-sanchez-reta-a-la-oposicion-a-una-mocion-de-censura/3151836)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez's Crisis: A Dead End for the Spanish Prime Minister**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is facing a difficult situation due to the corruption scandal surrounding his two closest collaborators, Santos Cerd\u00e1n and Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos. Despite the pressure, S\u00e1nchez has refused to resign and is determined to continue leading the government until 2027. However, his position is becoming increasingly untenable, and his own party, the PSOE, is starting to turn against him. S\u00e1nchez's options for resolving the crisis are limited, and he is considering several alternatives, including calling a special congress to restructure the party, dissolving the Cortes and calling early elections, or using the 'question of confidence' mechanism to seek a vote of confidence from the Congress. However, these options are not without risks, and S\u00e1nchez's decision will have significant consequences for the country and his own party. Meanwhile, opposition parties are considering a motion of censure against S\u00e1nchez, but it is unlikely to succeed due to the lack of support from the necessary number of deputies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 16, 2025 05:51 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/edicion/20250616/callejon-sin-salida-vias-constitucionales-resolver-crisis-bloqueadas-sanchez-socios/1003743805678_16.html)\n\n**Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez Apologizes to Citizens Amid Corruption Scandal**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez apologized to the citizens, stating that they will not hold an election until 2027. This comes after the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) Secretary General Santos Cerdan resigned from his position and as a member of parliament due to corruption allegations. The allegations, which included a secretly recorded conversation between Cerdan and former Ula\u015ft\u0131rma Bakan\u0131 Jose Luis Abalos' advisor Koldo Garcia, revealed that Cerdan had asked Garcia to manipulate the 2014 PSOE general secretary election in Sanchez's favor. Sanchez stated that he had not believed the allegations until the UCO's report, and that he had asked Cerdan to resign. Sanchez also announced that the PSOE Federal Committee would be re-elected immediately. The opposition parties and the coalition government's small partner Sumar alliance have been pressuring Sanchez to resign and hold early elections. Sanchez stated that Spain needs stability and continuity, and that there will be no elections until 2027.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[Yeni \u00c7a\u011f Gazetesi](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/avrupa-ulkesini-sarsan-yolsuzluk-krizi-924971h.htm)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez Rules Out Elections Until 2027, Denies Government Crisis**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez stated on Thursday that 'there will be no general elections until 2027' and expressed his intention to run again in two years. S\u00e1nchez also dismissed the possibility of a motion of censure or a government crisis following the scandal surrounding Santos Cerd\u00e1n, who resigned as Secretary of Organization of the PSOE after being implicated in a report by the UCO of the Guardia Civil. S\u00e1nchez made these statements at a press conference at the PSOE federal headquarters, where he appeared after 5 pm to 'explain himself' after Cerd\u00e1n's resignation. S\u00e1nchez emphasized that the current government, formed by the PSOE and Sumar, is 'suffering a clear siege by the opposition on numerous issues unrelated to reality.' He added that the government's project 'is doing good things for our country in the areas of democratic regeneration, social transformation, and a necessary model of country.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 04:07 PM\nSource:[ABC \ufeffTU DIARIO EN ESPA\u00d1OL](https://www.abc.es/espana/elecciones-mocion-crisis-gobierno-sanchez-descarta-decision-20250612180716-nt.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a wide range of expert perspectives\u2014including political risk analysis, constitutional law, comparative politics, coalition theory, sociology, and European studies\u2014forecasters consistently judge that Pedro S\u00e1nchez is likely to remain Prime Minister of Spain through December 31, 2025. Most experts assign probabilities between 74% and 90% for S\u00e1nchez\u2019s survival, with the majority clustering between 75% and 87%, and the highest single estimate at 90%. Their analyses emphasize the following key points:\n\n1. **Institutional Barriers:** Spain\u2019s requirement for a constructive vote of no confidence, which demands an absolute majority for both ousting the sitting PM and endorsing a specific alternative, sets a very high procedural bar. All experts agree this makes involuntary removals of prime ministers extremely rare outside of general elections.\n\n2. **Coalition Dynamics:** S\u00e1nchez leads a fragile minority coalition that has weathered substantial strain, primarily due to corruption scandals. However, coalition partners\u2014though disgruntled\u2014are reluctant to risk their own influence by triggering early elections, given the potential for right-wing gains. No expert sees a clear or willing alternative majority emerging in the current parliament.\n\n3. **Corruption Scandals:** While the ongoing corruption investigations have damaged S\u00e1nchez\u2019s legitimacy and heightened coalition instability, experts uniformly agree that unless a major new revelation implicates S\u00e1nchez personally or causes a decisive split among coalition partners, survival is likely. The perception is that scandals have not yet reached an existential level.\n\n4. **Opposition Disunity:** The main opposition parties (PP, Vox) lack both the numbers and the cross-bloc partnerships needed for a successful no-confidence motion. Even amid government weakness, the opposition\u2019s inability to present a credible alternative PM further reduces the risk of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s removal.\n\n5. **Historical Base Rates & Precedent:** Almost all experts explicitly cite the low historical frequency of mid-term prime ministerial ousters in Spain and comparable parliamentary systems. The 2018 Rajoy censure is seen as a major exception requiring extraordinary unity and scandal depth, unlikely to be repeated imminently.\n\n6. **Short Timeframe:** With only about 2.5 months left until resolution, the window for a successful motion of no confidence, mass resignation, or party revolt is seen as rapidly diminishing, further tilting probabilities toward continuity barring a sudden and dramatic escalation.\n\n7. **Risk Factors:** The main scenarios for S\u00e1nchez\u2019s removal identified by all experts involve either a shock escalation in corruption revelations directly implicating him or a collapse of coalition discipline. The probability for such developments within the short remaining time is rated relatively low given current news and party/coalition behavior.\n\n**Consensus Reasoning:** Barring an unexpected, explosive development\u2014such as direct legal jeopardy for S\u00e1nchez, mass coalition defection, or a sudden elite consensus for removal\u2014the institutional inertia, lack of parliamentary alternatives, and short timespan strongly favor S\u00e1nchez remaining PM through the end of 2025. However, the probabilities are generally shy of 100% due to real, but currently containable, risks of coalition breakdown or scandal escalation.",
