However, almost all sectoral and institutional forecasts (CaixaBank, Tinsa, UBS) now anticipate a deceleration from the extraordinary 20% 2024 rise, expecting 6-10% in 2025. While supply remains far below demand, affordability ceilings are increasingly binding, and there are early but notable policy efforts to cool the market. The base rate for consecutive >18% annual increases in developed cities is extremely low, and the 2024 spike appears unsustainable. My land use economics perspective highlights that while the fundamentals remain bullish, the combination of high prices, lagging wage growth, and some regulatory cooling measures make another >18% jump unlikely\u2014but not impossible. The risk of bubble dynamics or a late-year surge keeps the possibility alive, but the weight of evidence suggests a strong deceleration. I therefore assign a probability of 15%.",

While a few acknowledge the tail risk posed by Madrid's extraordinary supply shortage and global capital flows, nearly all emphasize the hard affordability ceiling, rising buyer fatigue, and clear signals from institutional forecasts (Caixabank, Tinsa, UBS, etc.) that expect significant deceleration (6-12%). Critiques of more bullish or tail-risk-leaning arguments stress that even in abnormal markets, gravity reasserts itself after an outlier year.

The Bank of Spain previously estimated a deficit of 400,000\u2013450,000 homes between 2022 and 2024, but Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1 now says 700,000 will be required: 'Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1 se\u00f1al\u00f3 que en 2025 se necesitar\u00edan unas 700.000 viviendas terminadas para los nuevos hogares creados.' Caixabank\u2019s study found a 515,000\u2011home deficit over 2021\u20112024 based on net household creation of 970,000 versus 454,000 new\u2011construction permits; when finished houses and alternative uses are considered, the deficit rises to 765,000.

Prices are rising across all autonomous communities, with San\u202fSebasti\u00e1n at 6,071\u202f\u20ac/m\u00b2\u2014over 250\u202f% above the national average\u2014and Madrid and the Balearic Islands above 3,900\u202f\u20ac/m\u00b2. The surge outpaces wage growth, tightening access for young and low\u2011income households and pushing rents higher. Analysts argue the growth is driven by solid demand, cautious financing and a stable labour market, and not a repeat of the 2008 bubble. Structural tension from limited new housing and international interest could still pose over\u2011valuation risks in the most active areas. Projections forecast a 5\u20137\u202f% price increase by the end of 2025, with continued pressure in major capitals and tourist zones, while other regions may see milder gains.

This surge pushed Madrid into the moderate\u2011risk bubble group, receiving a risk score of 0.80, up from a lower level a year earlier. UBS analysts note that the risk is even higher in cities such as Miami, Tokyo, Zurich, Los Angeles or Dubai, where Dubai has also seen the largest rise in risk since the previous edition. The price climb is attributed to strong foreign demand\u2014positioning Madrid as an alternative to more mature markets like London, Paris or Vancouver\u2014and to limited supply in central areas, which pressures prices even in less exclusive neighbourhoods. \"'El Gobierno ha intentado enfriar el mercado con medidas como la eliminaci\u00f3n del programa de golden visa para compradores de vivienda y un mayor control sobre los alquileres.'\" yet these initiatives have not succeeded in curbing the escalation. In terms of affordability, a qualified worker would need about six to seven years to buy a 60\u2011m\u00b2 apartment in Madrid, compared with 10\u201315 years in cities like Hong Kong, Paris or London. For renters, UBS points out that Madrid is close to markets where buying remains relatively profitable, meaning rent is expensive relative to purchase. The city\u2019s trajectory contrasts with European centres that have corrected past excesses, such as Paris, London or Munich, and aligns with Dubai and Tokyo, which still experience strong real\u2011price growth. UBS concludes that the return of international investment to markets with looser regulation and higher potential returns is driving Madrid\u2019s continued rise.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 04:34 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/2025-09-23/la-escalada-de-los-precios-de-la-vivienda-en-madrid-eleva-el-riesgo-de-burbuja-inmobiliaria.html)\n\n**Miguel Sebasti\u00e1n warns that even with a stable economy, people notice housing problems**\nOn the Spanish TV program Al rojo vivo, former minister and economist Miguel\u202fSebasti\u00e1n warned that, despite a stable economy, the public still feels the housing crisis. He said, 'Aunque la econom\u00eda vaya bien, la gente nota el problema de la vivienda', linking the issue to a loss of purchasing power amid high prices. The latest inflation data from the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (INE) showed the consumer price index (CPI) at 2.7\u202f% year\u2011on\u2011year in August, unchanged from July; food inflation moderated to 2.3\u202f%, while fuel and air transport kept household costs high. Sebasti\u00e1n noted that inflation is falling but the most recent figure was not good and he predicts a rise to 3\u202f% in September, which he described as 'malo'. Eurostat reported euro\u2011area inflation at 2\u202f% in August, underscoring Spain\u2019s steeper inflation. ECB President Christine\u202fLagarde said the bank was in a 'good position' and would not cut rates in the short term, a stance that could affect mortgage costs. Housing market data from Idealista indicated the highest price level on record, and CaixaBank Research forecasts price increases of over 10\u202f% in about 60\u202f% of Spanish municipalities with more than 25\u202f000 residents. Sebasti\u00e1n rejected policies that would encourage more home ownership, arguing instead that 'Hace falta vivienda en alquiler. Es el objetivo' and that Spain\u2019s high home\u2011ownership rates make further debt\u2011based ownership unsustainable. He also expressed concern about Spain\u2019s public deficit, citing France\u2019s situation as a warning that Spain could face a similar 'callej\u00f3n sin salida' if fiscal imbalances are not corrected. The broader European context remains fragile, with inflation near the ECB target and growth projected at only about 1\u202f% in 2026, which explains why, according to Sebasti\u00e1n, 'la gente nota' the everyday pressure despite apparent recovery.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 02:49 PM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2025-09-23/miguel-sebastian-economista-economia-vaya-bien-problema-vivienda-1qrt_4214673/)\n\n**Madrid\u2019s Housing Prices Surge, Bubble Risk Rising**\nThe UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index reports that Madrid\u2019s housing market has seen the largest price increase among major world cities, rising 14% over the past year, and is now positioned at a moderate but rising bubble\u2011risk level.  The index, which covers 21 cities, places Madrid in the middle of the table, behind Miami \u2013 the highest\u2011risk market \u2013 but ahead of cities such as London, Paris and Milan, which have low risk.  In the global context, prices in large cities have been stable in real terms, following three years of cooling after the 2020\u20112022 boom, yet Madrid \u201cbreaks the trend\u201d as the most dynamic market in Western Europe.\n\nRent prices in Madrid have also surged, with a 10% real\u2011term increase in the last year, driven by \"the strong creation of new households\" and \"the limited pace of new housing construction\".  Analysts warn that demand far outstrips supply, pressuring both the sale and rental markets, and that the structural shortage of new construction \u2013 exacerbated by long urban planning timelines and a lack of final\u2011stage land \u2013 remains a key issue.\n\nForeign investment has been a key driver of price growth in the capital, and the end of Spain\u2019s Golden Visa programme \u2013 which allowed residence permits through property purchase \u2013 has particularly impacted the luxury segment.  Regulatory measures to tighten rent controls have sparked debate among owners, funds and sector associations.\n\nUBS author Maciej Skoczek notes that \"more stringent rules, such as new taxes or purchase prohibitions and rent\u2011control measures, have reduced the attractiveness of previously highly demanded markets such as Vancouver, Sydney, Amsterdam, Paris, New York, Singapore and London, but have not fully contained the pressure when supply is insufficient.\"\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 12:04 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/vivienda-inmobiliario/noticias/13559036/09/25/ni-nueva-york-ni-londres-ni-paris-el-riesgo-de-burbuja-inmobiliaria-crece-en-madrid-con-los-precios-de-la-vivienda-disparados.html)\n\n**Real Estate Market: More Supply, Rising Prices, Increasing Vacancy and Cautious Demand**\nAccording to a new report from Economic Trends compiled by the Colegio de Profesionales Inmobiliarios de C\u00f3rdoba (CPI), the rental stock in C\u00f3rdoba is 83.4\u202f% above the 2023 average, surpassing pre\u2011Ley de Alquileres levels. Vacancy in residential properties rose to 3.7\u202f%, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, while commercial vacancy reached 3.1\u202f%, up 0.9 points. In July, real\u2011estate sales were 0.2\u202f% lower than the same month in 2024, indicating a stagnant market. Apartments accounted for 40.4\u202f% of transactions, followed by houses (25.5\u202f%) and housing (13.8\u202f%). New rental contracts saw price increases of +50.2\u202f% for houses, +51.8\u202f% for apartments, and +102.5\u202f% for commercial spaces, reflecting continued rent pressure. July rental activity fell 34.7\u202f% YoY, showing a decline in demand for new leases. In C\u00f3rdoba Capital, a two\u2011bedroom apartment rents for $600,000 (as of 15\u202fAugust), while in Nueva C\u00f3rdoba the same unit rents for $720,000. One\u2011bedroom rents range from $410,000 to $540,000 depending on the area. Median sale prices for two\u2011bedroom apartments are US$144,500 in Nueva C\u00f3rdoba and US$75,000 in the city centre; one\u2011bedroom medians range from US$58,000 to US$88,350. The report concludes that the market\u2019s recovery remains dependent on macro\u2011economic factors such as inflation, mortgage credit and income expectations.

This surge pushed Madrid into the moderate\u2011risk bubble group, receiving a risk score of 0.80, up from a lower level a year earlier. UBS analysts note that the risk is even higher in cities such as Miami, Tokyo, Zurich, Los Angeles or Dubai, where Dubai has also seen the largest rise in risk since the previous edition. The price climb is attributed to strong foreign demand\u2014positioning Madrid as an alternative to more mature markets like London, Paris or Vancouver\u2014and to limited supply in central areas, which pressures prices even in less exclusive neighbourhoods. \"'El Gobierno ha intentado enfriar el mercado con medidas como la eliminaci\u00f3n del programa de golden visa para compradores de vivienda y un mayor control sobre los alquileres.'\" yet these initiatives have not succeeded in curbing the escalation. In terms of affordability, a qualified worker would need about six to seven years to buy a 60\u2011m\u00b2 apartment in Madrid, compared with 10\u201315 years in cities like Hong Kong, Paris or London. For renters, UBS points out that Madrid is close to markets where buying remains relatively profitable, meaning rent is expensive relative to purchase. The city\u2019s trajectory contrasts with European centres that have corrected past excesses, such as Paris, London or Munich, and aligns with Dubai and Tokyo, which still experience strong real\u2011price growth. UBS concludes that the return of international investment to markets with looser regulation and higher potential returns is driving Madrid\u2019s continued rise.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 04:34 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/2025-09-23/la-escalada-de-los-precios-de-la-vivienda-en-madrid-eleva-el-riesgo-de-burbuja-inmobiliaria.html)\n\n**Miguel Sebasti\u00e1n warns that even with a stable economy, people notice housing problems**\nOn the Spanish TV program Al rojo vivo, former minister and economist Miguel\u202fSebasti\u00e1n warned that, despite a stable economy, the public still feels the housing crisis. He said, 'Aunque la econom\u00eda vaya bien, la gente nota el problema de la vivienda', linking the issue to a loss of purchasing power amid high prices. The latest inflation data from the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (INE) showed the consumer price index (CPI) at 2.7\u202f% year\u2011on\u2011year in August, unchanged from July; food inflation moderated to 2.3\u202f%, while fuel and air transport kept household costs high. Sebasti\u00e1n noted that inflation is falling but the most recent figure was not good and he predicts a rise to 3\u202f% in September, which he described as 'malo'. Eurostat reported euro\u2011area inflation at 2\u202f% in August, underscoring Spain\u2019s steeper inflation. ECB President Christine\u202fLagarde said the bank was in a 'good position' and would not cut rates in the short term, a stance that could affect mortgage costs. Housing market data from Idealista indicated the highest price level on record, and CaixaBank Research forecasts price increases of over 10\u202f% in about 60\u202f% of Spanish municipalities with more than 25\u202f000 residents. Sebasti\u00e1n rejected policies that would encourage more home ownership, arguing instead that 'Hace falta vivienda en alquiler. Es el objetivo' and that Spain\u2019s high home\u2011ownership rates make further debt\u2011based ownership unsustainable. He also expressed concern about Spain\u2019s public deficit, citing France\u2019s situation as a warning that Spain could face a similar 'callej\u00f3n sin salida' if fiscal imbalances are not corrected. The broader European context remains fragile, with inflation near the ECB target and growth projected at only about 1\u202f% in 2026, which explains why, according to Sebasti\u00e1n, 'la gente nota' the everyday pressure despite apparent recovery.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 02:49 PM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2025-09-23/miguel-sebastian-economista-economia-vaya-bien-problema-vivienda-1qrt_4214673/)\n\n**Youth Home Purchases in Spain Collapse to Less Than Half in 20 Years**\nThe article reports a steep decline in home purchases by Spanish youth (18\u201130 years old), falling from 22.5\u202f% in 2007 to 9.5\u202f% in 2025, a drop of more than half. The median age of buyers has risen from 40 to 47\u201148 years, an increase of eight years. Housing prices per square metre have returned to the 2007 level of \u20ac2,077, but are 27\u202f% below that historical peak when adjusted for inflation. Mortgage usage has fallen from 87\u202f% of sales in 2007 to 54\u202f% in 2024, with the share of the purchase price financed by a mortgage dropping from 84\u202f% to 72\u202f%. The number of mortgages signed fell from 722,000 in 2007 to roughly half that in 2024. In high\u2011price areas such as Madrid (80\u202f% of mortgages), larger loans are requested, whereas in less\u2011demanded provinces the debt burden is higher relative to income. The average financial effort needed to buy a house has decreased from six annual income\u2011based instalments in 2008 to 5.1 in 2024, though in expensive regions like the Balearic Islands up to eight instalments are required. Foreign buyers have tripled their share of purchases, rising from 4.4\u202f% in 2007 to 12.6\u202f% in 2024, and now account for one in five homes in 2025, especially in the Balearic Islands, Alicante, M\u00e1laga, Murcia and the Canary Islands. The share of foreign residents in sales is 13\u202f% overall, with 7\u202f% non\u2011resident buyers; in provinces such as Alicante (32\u202f%) and M\u00e1laga (20\u202f%) the non\u2011resident share is particularly high. The article cites Alberto Mart\u00ednez, director general of the Centro Tecnol\u00f3gico del Notariado, who warned in the Spanish Congress that the housing crisis is most acute in places like San Sebasti\u00e1n (\u20ac6,000/m\u00b2), Barcelona (\u20ac4,500/m\u00b2), Madrid (\u20ac4,900/m\u00b2) and the Balearic Islands (\u20ac3,800/m\u00b2). He noted that protected housing supply has collapsed, with only 10\u202f% of the 1995 peak of 122,000 units currently being built.

Los Angeles, Geneva, Amsterdam and Dubai also show visibly high risk, with Dubai registering the largest increase in risk since the previous edition, alongside Spain\u2019s capital. UBS notes that Madrid has the largest real\u2011price growth of any city in the study, rising 14% compared with last year. According to the firm, Madrid, Frankfurt and Munich fall into the moderate\u2011risk group, while London, Paris and Milan are considered low\u2011risk. Most experts dismiss a housing bubble in Spain, arguing the current issue is a supply shortage rather than a financial one. Cities that were flagged as high risk in 2021\u2014such as Frankfurt, Paris, Toronto, Hong Kong and Vancouver\u2014have seen an average real\u2011price decline of almost 20% from their peaks due to rising interest rates, whereas cities with lower imbalances have fallen about 5% on average. Hong Kong is the least affordable city in the study, requiring roughly 14 years of income to buy a 60\u2011m\u00b2 apartment. UBS warns that the ongoing, likely unsustainable rise in public debt could give the real\u2011estate market a new boost in the coming years, especially in a period of financial repression where demand for assets with positive real returns, like housing, increases. In the short term, UBS expects central banks to cut policy rates by 2026, gradually reducing real financing costs, while limited supply in most urban centers supports further price rises.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/inmobiliario/mercado/2025/09/23/68d2943c468aebf7588b4597.html)\n\n**Madrid\u2019s Housing Prices Surge, Bubble Risk Rising**\nThe UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index reports that Madrid\u2019s housing market has seen the largest price increase among major world cities, rising 14% over the past year, and is now positioned at a moderate but rising bubble\u2011risk level.  The index, which covers 21 cities, places Madrid in the middle of the table, behind Miami \u2013 the highest\u2011risk market \u2013 but ahead of cities such as London, Paris and Milan, which have low risk.  In the global context, prices in large cities have been stable in real terms, following three years of cooling after the 2020\u20112022 boom, yet Madrid \u201cbreaks the trend\u201d as the most dynamic market in Western Europe.\n\nRent prices in Madrid have also surged, with a 10% real\u2011term increase in the last year, driven by \"the strong creation of new households\" and \"the limited pace of new housing construction\".  Analysts warn that demand far outstrips supply, pressuring both the sale and rental markets, and that the structural shortage of new construction \u2013 exacerbated by long urban planning timelines and a lack of final\u2011stage land \u2013 remains a key issue.\n\nForeign investment has been a key driver of price growth in the capital, and the end of Spain\u2019s Golden Visa programme \u2013 which allowed residence permits through property purchase \u2013 has particularly impacted the luxury segment.  Regulatory measures to tighten rent controls have sparked debate among owners, funds and sector associations.\n\nUBS author Maciej Skoczek notes that \"more stringent rules, such as new taxes or purchase prohibitions and rent\u2011control measures, have reduced the attractiveness of previously highly demanded markets such as Vancouver, Sydney, Amsterdam, Paris, New York, Singapore and London, but have not fully contained the pressure when supply is insufficient.\"\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 12:04 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/vivienda-inmobiliario/noticias/13559036/09/25/ni-nueva-york-ni-londres-ni-paris-el-riesgo-de-burbuja-inmobiliaria-crece-en-madrid-con-los-precios-de-la-vivienda-disparados.html)\n\n**Barcel\u00f3 Anticipates a Tourism Cycle Shift, Yet Prices Remain Rising**\nBarcel\u00f3, Spain\u2019s second\u2011largest hotel group by rooms, forecasts a shift in the tourism cycle after a record\u2011breaking 2024 that ended with \u20ac3.200\u202fbillion in revenue, \u20ac500\u202fmillion in operating profit and \u20ac300\u202fmillion in net profit.  CEO Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez said, 'Mi impresi\u00f3n es que el ciclo empieza a declinar. No va a ser una ca\u00edda brusca, pero s\u00ed una desaceleraci\u00f3n en la demanda.' He notes that while occupancy is slowing, price levels will not fall; in summer the average revenue per available room rose 6\u20117\u202f% driven solely by higher rates.  The group expects a single\u2011digit growth in revenue, EBITDA and net profit next year and plans to invest at least \u20ac400\u202fmillion in acquisitions, targeting 20 new openings.  Key markets for expansion are Italy, Portugal and Spain\u2019s own high\u2011growth destinations such as Asturias, which has maintained its pre\u2011pandemic hotel capacity.  Gonz\u00e1lez also warned that the broader tourism slowdown could moderate investor sentiment and make purchase prices more rational, but he insists the hotel sector is not responsible for negative effects like tourismophobia or rising housing costs, citing a 29\u202f% increase in Spain\u2019s hotel rooms between 2005 and 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[Cinco D\u00edas](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2025-09-23/barcelo-anticipa-un-cambio-de-ciclo-en-el-turismo-pero-con-precios-todavia-al-alza.html)\n\n**Real\u2011Estate Analyst Warns Spain: Monthly Room Rent Equals Full Apartment**\nReal\u2011estate analyst Ferran Font warns that the monthly rent for a single room in Spain\u2019s major provincial capitals now equals that of a full apartment.  According to pisocompartido.com, the price of shared\u2011room rentals rose 12.55\u202f% from 422.92\u202f\u20ac in 2024 to 475.98\u202f\u20ac in 2025, an increase of 108.13\u202f% when compared to the previous year.  Font attributes the surge to demand outpacing supply and the contagion of residential rent hikes, noting that the price spike disproportionately affects renters aged 18\u201125 (50.78\u202f%) and 26\u201135 (29.38\u202f%).  The most affected cities are Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, while the provinces of Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia and M\u00e1laga account for 61.37\u202f% of room seekers.

The rise is part of a 45\u2011quarter streak of year\u2011on\u2011year gains. New\u2011home prices climbed 12.1% and used\u2011home prices jumped 12.8%, the latter a 0.1\u2011point rise over the previous quarter and the highest in 18 years since Q1 2007. Regional variations were pronounced: Murcia led with a 14.6% increase, followed by Arag\u00f3n and La Rioja at 13.7%, Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Andaluc\u00eda at 13.6%, and Asturias at 13.5%. Lower\u2011mid\u2011range increases were seen in Cantabria (10.8%), Castilla\u2011La Mancha (11.3%), Canarias and Catalu\u00f1a (11.6%) and Baleares (11.7%).\n\nCaixaBank Research attributes up to 39% of the price rise to the accumulated housing deficit, which has reached 515,000 units over the past four years, rising to 600,000 if finished homes are counted and 765,000 if alternative uses are included. The deficit is most acute in high\u2011pressure provinces such as Madrid, Barcelona, Alicante, Valencia and M\u00e1laga.\n\nThe market remains in an expansionary phase, with 700,000 transactions recorded in the first half of 2025\u201419.7% more than the same period in 2024\u2014and 132,000 new homes approved, a 13% year\u2011on\u2011year increase. Foreign demand is significant: 18% of sales (133,000 units) were purchased by foreigners, with 44% of those being non\u2011resident buyers, who tend to drive up prices.\n\nYolanda D\u00edaz, vice\u2011president of the Spanish government, criticised the \u201cbuitre\u201d funds that she says are taking over cities, calling for immediate rent reductions and a public social\u2011rent housing park. She also highlighted the impact of tourist and seasonal rentals on Galicia\u2019s housing market.

Between May\u202f2024 and May\u202f2025, 132\u202f000 new homes were approved \u2013 a 13\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year rise \u2013 with projections of 140\u202f000 in 2025 and 150\u202f000 in 2026. New household creation is roughly 180\u202f000 per year, so the construction gap will widen. CaixaBank warns that the expected price rise over the next two years will be 'superior al previsto para la renta disponible por hogar', making access to housing harder in high\u2011demand areas. Banco de Espa\u00f1a estimated that housing prices are 1.1\u202f%\u20138.5\u202f% above long\u2011term equilibrium by the end of 2024, up from 0.8\u202f%\u20134.8\u202f% six months earlier. The ECB estimates a 10\u202f% overvaluation of the Spanish residential market by the end of 2024. CaixaBank notes that overvaluation is already present in most territories, with the Balearic Islands and Madrid showing the strongest signs. Despite the price rise, the market is not expected to crash; the lack of excess supply, a stronger financial sector, and lower household debt (42.5\u202f% of GDP versus over 80\u202f% in 2010) mean prices are unlikely to fall sharply. The study concludes that accelerating affordable housing construction is the only way to curb prices. In August, the average price per square metre reached \u20ac2\u202f498, up 14.8\u202f% from the previous month, according to Idealista.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 06:23 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/observatorios/vivienda/20250905/vivienda-da-senales-sobrevaloracion-seguira-encareciendose-proximo-ano/1003743911616_0.html)\n\n**Housing Shortage Drives Prices Up, Explaining Up to 39\u202f% of the Rise**\nThe housing market in Spain is in a strong expansion phase, with prices at their highest since 2010 after adjusting for inflation. According to the CaixaBank Research Sectorial Inmobiliario report, demand has risen to 700,000 transactions in the last year, a 20\u202f% increase. The report attributes this surge to improved financing conditions, higher household purchasing power from a robust labour market, and sustained demographic growth driven by migration and new family types, while the lack of supply is the main driver of price pressure.\n\nIn the past year 132,000 new homes were approved, a 13\u202f% rise over the previous year, yet production remains insufficient to balance the market. The authors calculate that between 2021 and 2024 the housing deficit has accumulated 765,000 units, equal to 4\u202f% of Spain\u2019s housing stock, and that this shortfall explains 39\u202f% of the price increase observed during the period. The deficit is most acute in Madrid, Alicante, Barcelona, Valencia and M\u00e1laga, each needing more than 60,000 additional homes, while the \u201cEspa\u00f1a vaciada\u201d region has a smaller deficit but still exceeds 3,000 units in provinces such as Ja\u00e9n, Guadalajara, Lugo, Albacete, Burgos and Ciudad\u202fReal.\n\nSecond\u2011hand purchases dominate the market, but new\u2011home sales are gaining ground, rising 22.2\u202f% in the first half of the year, although still below the 2007 level when 42\u202f% of purchases were new homes.\n\nPrices have surpassed 2010 levels in real terms. Madrid and Catalonia lead the rise, followed by Andaluc\u00eda, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, the Valencian Community and Murcia. The report notes that the price surge since mid\u20112024 has shifted demand toward more affordable areas, also lifting prices in provinces bordering Madrid (Segovia, \u00c1vila, Toledo, Valladolid) and Barcelona.\n\nCaixaBank Research projects a 10\u202f% price increase this year and an additional 6.3\u202f% in 2026, outpacing the growth of disposable household income and further tightening housing affordability.\n\nForeign demand is a key factor: more than 50,000 homes were bought by foreigners in the first half of the year, 14\u202f% of all transactions, four points above the historical average for 2006\u20112024. The Ministry of Housing data show that one in five homes is now purchased by non\u2011resident foreigners, compared with 7\u202f% in 2007. Non\u2011resident buyers, who are mainly vacation or investment purchasers with higher purchasing power, paid an average price of \u20ac3,063 per square metre in the second half of 2024, nearly double the \u20ac1,713 per square metre paid by nationals. The price paid by non\u2011residents has risen 38\u202f% since 2019.\n\nThe report states, 'Es urgente reactivar la promoci\u00f3n residencial para mitigar las presiones en los precios', and notes that the deficit explains 'contin\u00faan aceler\u00e1ndose y dificultan el acceso a la vivienda'.

A sectorial report from CaixaBank Research attributes the surge to improved financing conditions, higher household purchasing power from a strong labour market, and continued demographic growth, while a persistent supply deficit \u2013 estimated at 765,000 units (4\u202f% of Spain\u2019s housing stock) between 2021 and 2024 \u2013 is the main driver of price pressure, accounting for 39\u202f% of the observed price rise. The report warns that the deficit is widening, with Madrid, Alicante, Barcelona, Valencia and M\u00e1laga each needing more than 60,000 additional homes, and that foreign buyers now represent 14\u202f% of all transactions, with non\u2011resident purchases averaging \u20ac3,063 per m\u00b2 versus \u20ac1,713 for nationals. Prices are projected to climb 10\u202f% this year and 6.3\u202f% in 2026, outpacing disposable income and tightening affordability.

The study attributes 39% of the recent price rise to a deficit of 765,000 homes\u2014about 4% of the total stock\u2014resulting from slow construction and population growth. The report notes that the price of housing is currently 1.1% to 8.5% above its long\u2011term equilibrium level by the end of 2024, up from 0.8% to 4.8% six months earlier, and that the European Central Bank estimates a 10% overvaluation by the same deadline. It also highlights that foreign non\u2011resident purchases, which now account for 7.9% of transactions, have increased by 40% since 2019, further driving up prices. The study projects a 10.8% price rise in 2025, easing to 6% the following year. Overvaluation is most pronounced in the Balearic Islands and Madrid, where prices have decoupled from household income, making home ownership increasingly difficult for young people. Despite the current overvaluation, the report stresses that the financial position of households, the construction sector, and the banking system is stronger than during the 2007\u20112008 crisis, and that the risk of a sharp price correction remains contained. \"En ambos casos, por el momento, se trata de niveles a\u00fan contenidos, pero la tendencia es claramente al alza,\" the study notes, underscoring the upward trend.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 04:24 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20250905/11029786/precio-vivienda-empieza-dar-signos-sobrevaloracion.html)\n\n**Spain's Housing Shortfall Explains Up to 39% of Market Price Rise**\nCaixaBank Research\u2019s sectorial real\u2011estate report shows that Spain\u2019s cumulative housing deficit of 515,000 units over the last four years could explain up to 39\u202f% of the 6\u202f% annual price rise observed, versus a 3.7\u202f% rise if the deficit were absent. The deficit climbs to 600\u202f000 when finished units are counted and to 765\u202f000 when alternative uses are subtracted. The shortfall is concentrated in high\u2011pressure provinces such as Madrid, Barcelona, Alicante, Valencia and M\u00e1laga, while the depopulated \u201cEspa\u00f1a vaciada\u201d shows a smaller gap. The market entered an expansive phase in the first half of 2025, with 700\u202f000 property transactions recorded in the 12\u202fmonths to June \u2013 a 19.7\u202f% increase over the same period in 2024 \u2013 driven by better financing conditions, rising household purchasing power and steady demographic growth. New construction has recovered, with 132\u202f000 new homes approved in the 12\u202fmonths to May, an inter\u2011annual rise of 13\u202f%. Foreign demand has become a key driver: 18\u202f% of sales in the last year up to Q1\u202f2025 were bought by foreigners, amounting to 133\u202f000 transactions \u2013 a record high \u2013 with more than half from resident foreigners and 44\u202f% from non\u2011resident buyers, who tend to pay higher prices for medium\u2011to\u2011high\u2011end properties. The Mediterranean arc and the archipelagos dominate foreign demand, but new hotspots such as Castell\u00f3n, Asturias, Huelva and C\u00f3rdoba are emerging. The report notes the market is \u2018en plena fase expansiva\u2019 and that foreign purchases reached \u2018un m\u00e1ximo hist\u00f3rico\u2019.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 02:59 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-deficit-vivienda-espana-explica-39-subida-precio-caixabank-research-20250905045949.html)\n\n**Housing Shortage Drives Up Prices, Explains Up to 40% of the Surge | Diario Sur**\nThe Spanish housing market is in an expansionary phase, with prices at their highest since 2010 (inflation\u2011adjusted). According to the CaixaBank Research Sectorial Inmobiliario report, demand rose 20% to 700,000 transactions last year, driven by better financing conditions, higher household purchasing power and sustained demographic growth. However, supply remains insufficient, with a housing deficit of 765,000 units\u2014about 4% of Spain\u2019s stock\u2014accumulated between 2021 and 2024. This shortfall accounts for 39% of the price increase observed in the same period. The report notes that only the province of Soria has no residential deficit, while Madrid, Alicante, Barcelona, Valencia and M\u00e1laga each need more than 60,000 homes, and provinces such as Ja\u00e9n, Guadalajara, Lugo, Albacete, Burgos and Ciudad\u202fReal have deficits above 3,000 units. New\u2011home purchases grew 22.2% in the first half of the year, yet they still lag behind the 2007 level where 42% of sales were new homes. Prices are projected to rise 10% this year and 6.3% in 2026, outpacing disposable income growth and tightening affordability. Foreign buyers now account for 14% of transactions\u201450,000 homes in the first half\u2014an increase of four points over the 2006\u20112024 average, and 18% of all sales, up from 7% in 2007. The average price per square metre for foreign purchases was \u20ac3,063 in the second half of 2024, nearly double the \u20ac1,713 for national buyers, reflecting a 38% rise since 2019. The report stresses that \"Es urgente reactivar la promoci\u00f3n residencial para mitigar las presiones en los precios\" and that \"Esta tendencia refleja que Espa\u00f1a se ha consolidado como uno de los destinos m\u00e1s atractivos para la inversi\u00f3n en inmuebles de lujo en Europa\".\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 10:02 PM\nSource:[Sur](https://www.diariosur.es/economia/falta-vivienda-agrava-explica-imparable-escalada-precios-20250905000247-nt.html)\n\n**Spanish Residential Market Sees Intense Activity and Rising Prices**\nThe Spanish residential market is experiencing intense activity, driven by a solid national and international demand, the renewed attractiveness of Spain as a destination for second-home investment, and a stabilization of financial conditions. According to recent data from Tinsa and CaixaBank, the price of housing could increase by up to 9% in 2025. This growth is more pronounced in markets such as Madrid, Barcelona, M\u00e1laga, and coastal areas, where demand is particularly high. In cities like M\u00e1laga, for example, the rental prices have already reached one of the highest levels in the country, as highlighted by the latest Idealista price report. The number of operations in the residential market has grown by 60% between 2023 and 2024, and the total value of transactions has increased by 157% during the same period.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 05:40 AM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/autor/Jorge-Perez-Curto)\n\n**Real Estate Portals: Mortgage Data Show 'Good Pulse' of Sector**\nThe real estate portals have assured that the data on new mortgages for housing show the 'good pulse' of the sector, supported by the dynamism of the real estate market and the interest of banks in continuing to grant mortgages. According to the data released by the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the number of mortgages constituted on housing increased by 14% in April compared to the same month in 2024, reaching 39,176 loans, the highest figure in a month of April since 2010. Juan Vill\u00e9n, director general of Idealista Hipotecas, expressed his confidence that the growth of the number of mortgages on housing will be maintained at least 'until summer', but 'certainly' until the end of the year, but he asks to 'keep an eye' on the evolution of inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence, which could 'condition or modify this positive trend'. Ferran Font, director of Studies of Pisos.com, lamented that, despite the good data on mortgages, the accessibility to housing continues 'without improving', since the demand remains 'very active' and, with good financing conditions, but the supply 'does not rise', with the prices being at 'maximums and without signs of changing in the short term'. Mar\u00eda Matos, director of Studies of Fotocasa, highlighted that, although 2025 already has better conditions in mortgages, these may 'not be enough' to counteract the accelerated increase in the value of housing, which can cause buyers to opt for 'more accessible mortgages', but face 'higher purchase prices'. The Federation of Associations of Real Estate Companies (Fadei) has indicated that housing is going through 'a phase of great activity' due to a very favorable context for both purchase and sale, with 'competitive interest rates' and a 'very high' housing need due to 'sustained demographic growth'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 20, 2025 08:50 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/economia/construccion-y-vivienda-00342/noticia-portales-inmobiliarios-aseguran-datos-hipotecas-muestran-buen-pulso-sector-20250620105046.html)\n\n**Housing prices in Spain continue to rise, with a 9.9% increase in May**\nThe Spanish housing market has started 2025 with a strong upward trend, with prices increasing by 9.9% in May compared to the same month in 2024, and 0.9% compared to the previous month, according to the Tinsa index. This growth exceeds inflation and shows sustained pressure in all regions, with the highest increases in the archipelagos, capitals, and large cities. The director of the studies service, Cristina Arias, has pointed out that the price increase is general, but is especially visible where the available space is scarce. 'The competition for the limited land in the islands and urban centers is generating a very acute tensioning', she has noted. CaixaBank Research has revised its forecast for 2025 upwards, predicting a 9% growth, 3.1 percentage points above its previous estimate. The economist Judit Montoriol links this trend not only to the improvement in financial conditions, but also to a recovery of household purchasing power and foreign demand pressure. The fall in interest rates has had an immediate effect on mortgage credit, with financing for the purchase of housing growing by 35.4% in the first quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2024. However, this bonanza has a negative side, as the prices are rising at a faster rate than the income, which is putting pressure on accessibility ratios. The report warns that this gap may worsen if the current imbalance between supply and demand is maintained.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/2025-06-05/el-precio-de-la-vivienda-no-cede-y-podria-subir-hasta-un-9-en-2025.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse panel of forecasting experts\u2014including specialists in real estate analysis, economics, urban planning, finance, and regional studies\u2014there is strong consensus that while Madrid's housing market will likely experience robust price growth in 2025, the probability of prices rising by more than 18% (as in the exceptional 20% increase seen in 2024) is low but not negligible. All experts cite persistent and acute supply shortages and strong demand (especially from foreign and high-income buyers) as key upward pressures. However, these are balanced\u2014or outweighed\u2014by significant affordability constraints, policy/regulatory interventions (like the end of the Golden Visa and rent controls), and the historical rarity of back-to-back >18% price increases in mature European capitals. Consensus sector and banking forecasts for 2025 range from 6% to 14% rises, with most clustering at 8\u201312%, well below the 18% threshold. Experts consistently flag that after an extraordinary surge, mean reversion is likely: buyer fatigue, stretched affordability, and growing policy scrutiny are expected to moderate further gains. The main scenario envisioned is a strong, possibly double-digit increase, but not exceeding 18%. A small but meaningful probability is assigned to another outsized jump, contingent primarily on even sharper supply bottlenecks and a surge in international or speculative demand without effective policy intervention. Probabilities given for a >18% increase cluster between 10% and 22% (modal values: 10%-18%), with no expert estimating this outcome as more likely than not. The summary judgment is that robust growth is highly probable, but another year of explosive, >18% gains is unlikely barring extraordinary circumstances.",
