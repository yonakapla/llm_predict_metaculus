However, Fateh's campaign may partially compensate with grassroots enthusiasm and demographic mobilization, particularly if they can frame the endorsement loss as establishment sabotage. RCV slightly mitigates the risk of vote splitting, and the lack of strong third-party or Republican contenders means Fateh's ceiling is high if turnout models are accurate. Given the base rate (incumbents win 60%), but adjusting for uniquely adverse conditions for Frey and high progressive energy, I judge Fateh as a slight favorite, but not overwhelmingly so.

However, Frey is a weakened incumbent, with poor favorability and a record increasingly out of step with the city\u2019s leftward drift.

Given the lack of public polling post-endorsement-vacation and the critical importance of party legitimacy in urban machine politics, the base rate for insurgent progressive victories remains below 50% unless the party is united. Fateh\u2019s chances are further reduced by the risk that divided or demobilized moderates will coalesce around Frey in the final ranked-choice rounds.

The critiques of overreliance on party machinery and baseline incumbency highlighted how Minneapolis's political context in 2025 is more volatile, with weakened party discipline, a demobilized incumbent base, and a highly energized progressive/anti-establishment movement. The defense of ranked-choice voting analytics is persuasive: with Fateh as the only major progressive, the risk of left vote-splitting is minimal, and late-round consolidation could work in his favor. The DFL endorsement fiasco, while a setback, may actually catalyze turnout and frame Fateh as the anti-establishment candidate, especially in underrepresented communities. Given the weight of group consensus leaning toward higher odds and the compelling arguments that the city's political winds are not adequately reflected in my initial, more status-quo-anchored estimate, I am revising upward\u2014but not to outright favorite status, as incumbency and organizational confusion still matter. A probability in the mid-40s better reflects the volatility and genuine competitiveness of this race.",

Importantly, the consensus is that Frey's incumbency advantage is seriously eroded by his sharply negative favorability, and the progressive base is more unified than in the past. My critique of the incumbency-centric view highlights that social identity dynamics in Minneapolis are unusually salient, and that the institutional chaos might actually help Fateh frame himself as the outsider champion. The main counterarguments (overreliance on base rates, overstated party machinery) have been effectively challenged. Therefore, I am revising my probability upward to reflect Fateh's real and possibly underestimated chance, while still acknowledging substantial uncertainty due to organizational hurdles.",

            "reasoning_for_revised_probability": "In the group deliberation, several key points emerged. Forecasters who leaned higher for Fateh (62-63%) often over-relied on progressive enthusiasm and polling that is now dated, while underestimating the chilling effect of DFL chaos, especially on sporadic and minority voters. Conversely, the lowest estimates (32%) likely underweight the dynamic anti-incumbent mood and the consolidation of the left in the absence of a major third candidate. I remain convinced that the DFL endorsement fiasco is a double-edged sword: it energizes some but also increases confusion and distrust among low-propensity, minority, and immigrant voters\u2014groups that are crucial for Fateh's coalition but particularly sensitive to signals of institutional instability. The lack of fresh, high-quality polling and the persistence of incumbency advantages in urban politics, even amid shifting coalitions, reinforce the need for caution. Reviewing both sides, I see a slightly more competitive race than my peers with the lowest probabilities, but I resist raising my forecast: the risks of demobilization, the weight of the status quo, and the lingering effects of party disunity are too great to justify an increase. I maintain my forecast at 43%.",

The original question opened on 2025-07-24 15:40:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/38922). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nWashington Post (July 24, 2025): [Is a Mamdani repeat coming to the Midwest? A democratic socialist is getting a boost in Minnesota.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/is-a-mamdani-repeat-coming-to-the-midwest-a-democratic-socialist-is-getting-a-boost-in-minnesota/ar-AA1JcfEP)\n\n> The Democratic Party in Minneapolis over the weekend endorsed a democratic socialist over the two-term incumbent in the city\u2019s mayoral race, the latest indicator of increased momentum for the progressive left in local races across the country.\n\n> Delegates of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota\u2019s most populous city on Saturday threw their support behind state Sen. Omar Fateh, who defeated Mayor Jacob Frey, at the party\u2019s convention. The endorsement comes less than a month after Zohran Mamdani, also a democratic socialist and state lawmaker, won the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York.\n\n> The mayoral race is a ranked-choice election, like in New York, and the general election will take place in November when all candidates will compete on the same ballot regardless of party affiliation. A Democrat is expected to win the race, as Minneapolis is a heavily Democratic city that has been led by Democratic mayors for more than 47 years.\n\n> While several candidates are running, the DFL endorsement effectively pits a democratic socialist against a relatively more moderate Frey. The mayoral race is far from over, according to political observers \u2014 but the endorsement does boost Fateh\u2019s profile. It also represents a major win for liberals, and is likely to draw national attention and money on the race.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st Century, incumbent mayors of Minneapolis have been re-elected 60% of the time: in 2021, 2009, 2005. Conversely, they have lost 40% of the time: in 2017 (to the current mayor, Jacob Frey) and in 2001.&#x20;\n\nAt the time of this question, there has been little public polling in the race. A poll from May 2025 [found](https://www.mplsforthemany.com/polling) Mayor Frey with -21% net favorability, which is 20 points worse than in September 2021, when Frey won the final round by 12.5 points against a progressive field that was divided into two main contenders, as compared with one (Fateh) in the 2025 election.&#x20;\n\nMayor Frey is also appealing his loss of the\u00a0Minneapolis Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party\u2019s endorsement, according to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5412323-minneapolis-mayor-frey-appeal-endorsement/).&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38922,\"question_id\":38271}}`",

According to a poll by AARP New\u202fYork\u2011Gotham Polling & Analytics, he leads with 41.8\u202f% voter intent, outpacing former governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent mayor Eric Adams.  Mamdani\u2019s platform is a democratic\u2011socialist agenda that includes a rent\u2011freeze and a higher minimum wage, and he has received endorsements from Bernie Sanders, Alexandria\u202fOcasio\u2011Cortez and the Working\u202fFamilies\u202fParty.  Critics argue that his fiscal proposals could trigger capital flight and reduce investment.  Fund\u2011raising figures show Cuomo raised more than $1.5\u202fmillion from Long Island, while Adams has exceeded $1\u202fmillion; Mamdani\u2019s campaign has raised less, relying mainly on progressive voters and marginalized communities.

Kathy Hochul's 2026 re\u2011election campaign, even after Hochul publicly supported him in a New\u202fYork\u202fTimes op\u2011ed. Mamdani told reporters his focus is 'on November,' and said, 'I'm excited to have the governor's support,' without committing to reciprocation. Hochul's endorsement came while other top Democrats, such as Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, have withheld public backing. Mamdani\u2019s platform includes raising the minimum wage to $30, opening state\u2011run grocery stores, and taxing what he calls 'richer and whiter' neighborhoods, prompting business owners to voice concerns and some to consider leaving the city. He has also been criticized for not condemning anti\u2011police slogans like 'globalize the intifada' and the phrase 'From the river to the sea'; he now says he 'discourages' the use of the latter only after pressure from Jewish leaders. The article argues that Hochul\u2019s endorsement signals a shift in the Democratic Party toward the far left and warns that her gamble could cost her political capital. The editor\u2019s note invites readers to support Townhall\u2019s conservative reporting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Townhall](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2025/09/16/socialist-nyc-mayoral-nominee-refuses-to-endorse-hochul-despite-her-support-n2663436)\n\n**New York Democratic governor endorses Zohran Mamdani after he kowtows to billionaires**\nOn Sunday, after a 12\u2011week delay, New\u202fYork Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed Zohran\u202fMamdani, the winner of the June Democratic mayoral primary, as reported by the World\u202fSocialist on September\u202f16\u202f2025. The endorsement followed a meeting between Mamdani and billionaire former mayor Michael\u202fBloomberg, who did not endorse him but met with him, according to the article. Hochul\u2019s endorsement broke a pattern of stone\u2011walling by senior Democrats, including Senators Chuck\u202fSchumer and Kirsten\u202fGillibrand and House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries. Mamdani is the frontrunner in a four\u2011way November\u202f4 election that also includes former Governor Andrew\u202fCuomo (running as an independent), incumbent Mayor Eric\u202fAdams (also independent) and Republican Curtis\u202fSliwa. House members Pat\u202fRyan, Gerry\u202fNadler, Senator Chris\u202fVan\u202fHollen and Representative Jamie\u202fRaskin have publicly endorsed Mamdani. Trump reacted to the endorsement with a threat, saying, 'This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New\u202fYork City. How can such a thing happen? Washington will be watching this situation very closely. No reason to be sending good money after bad!' The article also notes that Hochul\u2019s op\u2011ed in the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes emphasized police resources, quoting her as saying, 'I urged him to ensure that there is strong leadership at the helm of the N.Y.P.D. -- and he agreed.' It further describes Hochul as a right\u2011wing figure who has opposed driver\u2019s licenses for immigrant workers and deployed National Guard troops in subways. The piece portrays Bloomberg\u2019s meeting as cordial but not an endorsement, and claims that Mamdani has agreed to abandon certain rhetoric and will accept police presence, while warning that Trump may deploy the National Guard in New\u202fYork\u202fCity. The article is heavily political and sensational in tone.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 03:13 AM\nSource:[World Socialist](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/09/16/nkjc-s16.html)\n\n**Mamdani declines to immediately back NY Gov. Kathy Hochul's reelection after she offers him coveted endorsement**\nDemocratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, declined to endorse Gov. Kathy Hochul for a second term after she endorsed him for mayor. He said, 'My focus is on November,' and added, 'And I'm excited to have the governor's support in that fight for November as we make it clear that we can put the days of City Hall and Albany being at war in the past.' Hochul, a moderate Democrat, had endorsed him after weeks of hesitation, a move that has pressured other New York Democrats to support him. Mamdani's decision comes as Hochul faces potential challenges from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in the 2026 Democratic primary and from Republican Elise Stefanik in the general election. In a New York Times op\u2011ed, Hochul wrote, 'I do not see eye to eye on everything' with him but will stand together against those who attempt to tear us apart.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 12:46 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mamdani-declines-immediately-back-ny-004600459.html)\n\n**The Democratic Party is in fits over Mamdani's bid for NYC mayor. Republicans are loving it**\nDemocratic Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized his party\u2019s leadership for not endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, calling the stance 'spineless' and urging Democrats to support him. Mamdani, a 33\u2011year\u2011old self\u2011described democratic socialist, has drawn support from progressives but has been distanced by moderate Democrats and party leaders. Republican figures, including former President Donald Trump, have seized on the split, labeling Mamdani a communist and threatening to withhold federal funds. Democratic leaders such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have declined to endorse him, citing strategic considerations. Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani, while other New York representatives have split, with Rep. Tom Suozzi refusing endorsement and Rep. Pat Ryan supporting him. The divide echoes the earlier rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has defended Mamdani. National progressive groups and figures like Joseph Geevarghese and Abdul El\u2011Sayed have expressed frustration at the establishment\u2019s silence. Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia have linked Mamdani to the Democratic brand in their campaigns. The controversy is seen as a test of the Democratic Party\u2019s unity heading into the 2026 midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 09:54 PM\nSource:[My Northwest](https://mynorthwest.com/national/the-democratic-party-is-in-fits-over-mamdanis-bid-for-nyc-mayor-republicans-are-loving-it/4132150)\n\n**Mamdani Apologizes for Anti\u2011Police Remarks, Faces Mixed Reactions**\nOn September 15, 2025, New\u202fYork City mayoral candidate Zohran\u202fMamdani publicly apologized for earlier remarks that criticized the NYPD as \"racist, anti\u2011gay, and a major threat to public safety,\" according to a report by Epoch Times journalist Wang\u202fLiefei. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, had long advocated for police budget cuts since the 2020 death of George\u202fFloyd. The shift in his stance followed the July\u202f28, 2025 shooting in Midtown Manhattan, where gunman Shane\u202fTamura fired nearly 50 rounds, killing five people, including a fallen officer\u2014 the deadliest mass shooting in the city in 25\u202fyears. The incident prompted mixed reactions: some politicians praised his acknowledgment of the limits of police\u2011budget cuts, while former Governor Gavin\u202fNewsom criticized the change as inconsistent. Police union leader Patrick\u202fHendry demanded more than a verbal apology, calling for concrete actions to improve officer pay and working conditions. Mamdani now faces dual pressure\u2014to appease the 30,000\u2011plus NYPD workforce and to retain progressive voters\u2019 trust. Meanwhile, Governor\u202fHoch expressed support, saying, 'He should apologize. I think this is an appropriate response. He acknowledges the mistake and works to earn officers\u2019 respect, and I appreciate that.' Hoch also formally endorsed Mamdani for mayor, marking a significant alliance between the party\u2019s moderate and progressive wings. The outcome of Mamdani\u2019s attempt to resolve the controversy will be a key test of his campaign\u2019s viability.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 02:27 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/9/17/n14596288.htm)\n\n**Could Zohran Mamdani Win New\u202fYork\u2019s 2025 Mayoral Election?**\nZohran Mamdani, a 33\u2011year\u2011old member of the New\u202fYork State Assembly, has become the unexpected front\u2011runner for the 2025 New\u202fYork City mayoral race.

Hochul had endorsed him on Sunday, but Mamdani said 'My focus is on November, and I'm excited to have the governor's support in that fight for November.' The move drew criticism from Rep. Elise Stefanik, who tweeted 'Even Mamdani refuses to support Kathy Hochul less than 24 hours after she endorsed him!' and from campaign strategist Hank Sheinkopf, who said 'No good deed goes unpunished. Hochul looks weak.' Sheinkopf also claimed Mamdani and the Democratic Socialists of America are in charge. Asian Wave Alliance member Yiatin Chu added 'Hochul got played.' Hochul, who is the de facto leader of New York\u2019s Democratic Party, had previously joked about Canada and criticized Hamas. A Siena College poll released Tuesday showed Hochul leading Stefanik 52% to 27% among registered voters in a potential match\u2011up, though Republican sources questioned its validity.

House members Pat\u202fRyan, Gerry\u202fNadler, Senator Chris\u202fVan\u202fHollen and Representative Jamie\u202fRaskin have publicly endorsed Mamdani. Trump reacted to the endorsement with a threat, saying, 'This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New\u202fYork City. How can such a thing happen? Washington will be watching this situation very closely. No reason to be sending good money after bad!' The article also notes that Hochul\u2019s op\u2011ed in the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes emphasized police resources, quoting her as saying, 'I urged him to ensure that there is strong leadership at the helm of the N.Y.P.D. -- and he agreed.' It further describes Hochul as a right\u2011wing figure who has opposed driver\u2019s licenses for immigrant workers and deployed National Guard troops in subways. The piece portrays Bloomberg\u2019s meeting as cordial but not an endorsement, and claims that Mamdani has agreed to abandon certain rhetoric and will accept police presence, while warning that Trump may deploy the National Guard in New\u202fYork\u202fCity. The article is heavily political and sensational in tone.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 03:13 AM\nSource:[World Socialist](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/09/16/nkjc-s16.html)\n\n**Mamdani declines to immediately back NY Gov.

He said, 'My focus is on November,' and added, 'And I'm excited to have the governor's support in that fight for November as we make it clear that we can put the days of City Hall and Albany being at war in the past.' Hochul, a moderate Democrat, had endorsed him after weeks of hesitation, a move that has pressured other New York Democrats to support him. Mamdani's decision comes as Hochul faces potential challenges from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in the 2026 Democratic primary and from Republican Elise Stefanik in the general election. In a New York Times op\u2011ed, Hochul wrote, 'I do not see eye to eye on everything' with him but will stand together against those who attempt to tear us apart.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 12:46 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mamdani-declines-immediately-back-ny-004600459.html)\n\n**The Democratic Party is in fits over Mamdani's bid for NYC mayor....**\nThe article reports a growing rift within the Democratic Party over the nomination of Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor. Democratic Senator Chris Van\u202fHollen criticized party leaders in Iowa for refusing to endorse Mamdani, calling their stance \"spineless\" and urging them to \"get behind him now.\" Mamdani, a 33\u2011year\u2011old self\u2011described democratic socialist, has attracted support from progressives for his economic populism and grassroots appeal, while moderate Democrats and Washington\u2011based leaders have distanced themselves. Democratic Governor Kathy\u202fHochul endorsed Mamdani, declaring that \"New\u202fYork needs leaders who will put aside differences, stand up and fight back against Mr.\u202fTrump,\" a statement echoed by progressive Senator Bernie\u202fSanders, who said he could not understand why New\u202fYork leaders were not supporting the candidate. Republican President Donald\u202fTrump seized the opportunity to criticize Mamdani, labeling him a communist and threatening to withhold federal funds if he were elected. The article also notes that House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck\u202fSchumer have declined to endorse Mamdani, citing their own endorsement policies. The split is highlighted by contrasting endorsements within the New\u202fYork delegation: Rep.\u202fTom\u202fSuozzi declined to support Mamdani, while Rep.\u202fPat\u202fRyan endorsed him. National progressive groups such as Our\u202fRevolution have rallied behind Mamdani, citing widespread grassroots anger.

Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani, while other New York representatives have split, with Rep. Tom Suozzi refusing endorsement and Rep. Pat Ryan supporting him. The divide echoes the earlier rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has defended Mamdani. National progressive groups and figures like Joseph Geevarghese and Abdul El\u2011Sayed have expressed frustration at the establishment\u2019s silence. Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia have linked Mamdani to the Democratic brand in their campaigns.

Van Hollen urges support for Mamdani in NYC mayoral race amid party divisions**\nSen. Chris Van\u202fHollen, a Democrat from Maryland, urged New Yorkers to back Democratic nominee Zohran\u202fMamdani in the upcoming New\u202fYork City mayoral race, saying the party has drifted toward moneyed interests and lost its vision. In a speech in Iowa, Van\u202fHollen said, 'I believe we, the Democratic party - we've drifted... Too often we have come under the sway of powerful moneyed interests at the expense of working people.' Mam\u202fMamdani, a self\u2011proclaimed Democratic socialist, has campaigned on affordable housing, city\u2011owned grocery stores, free childcare and a new Department of Community Safety, and he said, 'There will be visible trained teams in our subways... Their presence and their work will make all of us safe.' Governor Kathy\u202fHochul endorsed Mam\u202fMamdani in a New\u202fYork\u202fTimes opinion piece, writing that she had 'frank conversations' with him and supports his goal of an affordable city. The endorsement prompted a response from former President Donald\u202fTrump, who on Truth\u202fSocial called the endorsement a 'rather shocking development' and suggested withholding federal funds if Mam\u202fMamdani wins. A New\u202fYork\u202fTimes/Siena poll released earlier this month shows Mam\u202fMamdani with 46\u202f% support, compared with 24\u202f% for former Governor Andrew\u202fCuomo (independent), 15\u202f% for Republican Curtis\u202fSliwa and 9\u202f% for incumbent Mayor Eric\u202fAdams.

    "summary": "The expert forecasts converge on a highly competitive and unusually volatile Minneapolis mayoral race in 2025 between Omar Fateh (progressive, Somali-American, DSA) and incumbent Jacob Frey. The most salient and cross-cutting factor is the initial DFL (Democratic-Farmer-Labor) endorsement of Fateh\u2014a historic and momentum-building moment\u2014that was later vacated due to process irregularities, stripping Fateh of a major organizational and symbolic advantage just weeks before the election. Experts widely agree that the loss of the DFL endorsement constitutes a significant setback for Fateh, potentially demobilizing progressive and minority base voters, muddying campaign legitimacy, and depriving his team of crucial GOTV infrastructure.\n\nNevertheless, multiple forecasters note countervailing winds that buoy Fateh's prospects above baseline levels for a challenger: Frey is historically unpopular (with a recent poll showing -21% net favorability, 20 points worse than his last campaign), Fateh benefits from national progressive momentum following Mamdani's recent victory in NYC, and the ranked-choice voting system this year favors anti-incumbent coalition-building (especially since the left is less fragmented than in 2021). Fateh\u2019s unique identity and demographic appeal further support high-turnout potential among Somali, Muslim, and Black communities, if his campaign can maintain mobilization despite organizational headwinds and establishment backlash.\n\nOn the other hand, several subject matter experts\u2014especially those focusing on urban machine politics and incumbency advantage\u2014emphasize structural barriers: the DFL's internal retrenchment, Minneapolis\u2019s historical preference for incumbents (60% re-election rate since 2001), and the risk of moderate, centrist, or swing voters coalescing around Frey due to concerns over party infighting and perceived radicalism. Fear of racialized or Islamophobic backlash and negative campaigning against Fateh\u2019s outsider profile are also cited as possible drags on his coalition. History in Minneapolis shows that losing or lacking the DFL endorsement is typically a major disadvantage.\n\nForecast probabilities reflect the divided and uncertain landscape: estimates for Fateh\u2019s chances of winning the mayoralty range from a low of 32% (urban political machine and voter behavior theorists) to a high of 63% (public opinion polling strategists), with several clustered in the mid-40% to low-60% range. Three forecasters (especially those focused on polling, GOTV, and RCV analytics) slightly favor Fateh, citing national progressive tides, consolidated left support, and Frey\u2019s deep unpopularity, while others still lean toward Frey owing to institutional inertia and the DFL chaos. The average of the forecasts places Fateh as a narrow underdog or slight favorite, but all emphasize a narrow margin and substantial uncertainty.\n\nIn conclusion, experts collectively see a highly contested race where Fateh\u2019s chances, though hurt by the DFL endorsement loss, remain historically high given the progressive moment, unified left, RCV dynamics, and incumbent unpopularity, but are checked by the enduring power of Minneapolis\u2019s party machine, the classic strengths of incumbency, and potential for organizational demobilization. The consensus is that Fateh has a plausible but not dominant path to victory, with winning likely only if his campaign surmounts both institutional and identity-based headwinds and effectively mobilizes the progressive and minority base.",
