My expertise allows me to assess not only the technical feasibility of such an operation, but also the likely warning indicators, timelines, and thresholds for escalation versus coercive signaling. This perspective is crucial, as amphibious invasions are among the most complex military operations, and success (or even initiation) depends on a confluence of political will, military readiness, surprise, and the ability to deter or overcome outside intervention.",

Too many forecasters are prone to let a flurry of exercises or belligerent rhetoric rattle their judgment, but you stick to the core evidence: no massing of amphibious lift, no surge in military logistics, no elite signaling from Beijing that an existential risk is being undertaken.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) officially claims to be the sole legitimate government of the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, while the Republic of China (ROC) currently governs the islands. Tensions between the two sides have persisted since the Chinese Civil War. Although there has been no active conflict since 1979, no formal armistice or peace treaty has been signed.\n\n Recent years have seen increased military activity and diplomatic tensions, with China conducting military exercises near Taiwan and increasing pressure through economic and political means.

They also strongly opposed the so\u2011called \"illegal maritime claims\" in the South China Sea and the attempts to enforce such claims. While the statement did not name China directly, it was issued amid the underlying tension between Beijing and Washington over the South China Sea dispute.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the remarks as \"irresponsible\" and urged the three countries to \"stop any form of complicity with separatist activities for Taiwan independence\". Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the ministry, told reporters that the nations should respect the efforts of regional states to resolve issues through dialogue and to stop \"exaggerating tensions and provoking confrontations\".\n\nTaiwan\u2019s foreign ministry welcomed the expression of concern and said it would cooperate with the United States, Japan, South Korea and like-minded partners to ensure peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo\u2011Pacific. Hsiao Kuang\u2011wei, a spokesperson, told reporters in Taipei that Taiwan would work with those partners to maintain stability.\n\nThe joint statement was released after the ministers met in New York on Monday, where they also reaffirmed their commitment to ending North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme. China, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, has intensified military activities near Taiwan, including war\u2011game exercises, while Taiwan rejects China\u2019s territorial claims.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 01:57 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mundo/diplomatas-de-eua-coreia-do-sul-e-japao-expressam-preocupacao-com-estreito-de-taiwan/)\n\n**US\u2011Japan\u2011South Korea Foreign Ministers Meeting: Emphasizing Maintenance of Taiwan Strait Peace and Stability, Opposing Any Attempts to Change the Status Quo**\nThe joint statement issued after the meeting of the U.S., Japanese, and South Korean foreign ministers in New York on September\u202f23\u202f2025 stresses several key points. It begins by reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and South Korea, noting that the U.S. \"reaffirms its iron\u2011clad commitment to the defense of Japan and South Korea, backed by unmatched military strength, including nuclear capability\". The ministers also \"welcome the cooperation of the three coast guards, including the exchange of knowledge and experience, to strengthen maritime accident response and to provide capacity\u2011building support to ASEAN members in May\u202f2025\". They \"strongly oppose illegal maritime claims in the South China Sea and any attempts to change the status quo, including dangerous and destabilising actions in the Indo\u2011Pacific\" and \"emphasise the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo\u2011Pacific and upholding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including freedom of navigation and overflight and other legitimate uses of the sea\". The statement highlights the importance of \"maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\" and expresses concern over \"increasing destabilising actions around Taiwan\", urging a peaceful resolution and supporting Taiwan\u2019s meaningful participation in appropriate international organisations. It also reiterates support for ASEAN\u2019s central role and the ASEAN\u2011led regional architecture, recognises the strategic importance of the Arctic, and calls for progress in Russia\u2011Ukraine negotiations. Regarding North Korea, the ministers reaffirm a \"firm commitment to achieving complete denuclearisation of the DPRK in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, while continuing dialogue and diplomacy to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula\" and urge all UN members to comply with relevant resolutions. They express serious concern over the growing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, urging an immediate halt to such activities. Finally, the statement outlines cooperation in economic security, including supply\u2011chain resilience, digital infrastructure, AI, quantum technology, and biotechnology, and commits to advancing joint nuclear\u2011reactor development and other emerging\u2011technology collaborations. The U.S., Japan, and South Korea also agree to continue dialogue on economic security and to strengthen the tri\u2011advisory secretariat that coordinates action\u2011oriented goals.\n\nThe statement was followed by a response from Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which noted that this is the third time this year the three foreign ministers have reiterated the importance of Taiwan Strait stability, and that Taiwan will continue to enhance its defence capabilities and economic resilience in partnership with like\u2011minded allies.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 08:41 AM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85/20250923-%E7%BE%8E%E6%97%A5%E9%9F%A9%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%E4%BC%9A-%E5%BC%BA%E8%B0%83%E7%BB%B4%E6%8A%A4%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%92%8C%E5%B9%B3%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%80%A7%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%8D%E5%AF%B9%E5%9C%A8%E5%8D%B0%E5%A4%AA%E6%B5%B7%E5%9F%9F%E4%BB%BB%E4%BD%95%E6%94%B9%E5%8F%98%E7%8E%B0%E7%8A%B6%E7%9A%84%E4%BC%81%E5%9B%BE)\n\n**Foreign Ministry: US, Japan, South Korea\u2019s Statements on Taiwan and Maritime Issues Cause Strong Dissatisfaction, China Firmly Opposes**\nOn September 23, 2025, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jikun held a routine press conference. Reuters asked about a joint statement by the foreign ministers of South Korea, Japan and the United States that \"expressed concern over increasingly frequent destabilising activities around Taiwan and strongly opposed illegal maritime claims.\" Guo replied that the three countries were \"talking a lot about Taiwan and maritime issues, interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs and slandering China.\" He said China was \"strongly dissatisfied\" and \"firmly opposed\" the remarks. Guo reiterated that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and that the Taiwan issue is purely an internal matter, not subject to external interference. He warned that the greatest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is \"Taiwan independence\" separatist acts and external forces\u2019 support. He called on other countries to uphold the One China principle, stop supporting \"Taiwan independence\" and not send wrong signals to separatist forces. He also said the South China Sea situation remains generally stable, that China continues to defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights, and is committed to resolving differences with relevant parties through dialogue. He urged other countries to respect the efforts of regional states to resolve issues through dialogue and maintain peace, and to stop stoking tensions.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 07:55 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8msrNhjBWue)\n\n**US, South Korea, Japan Express Concern Over Taiwan\u2011Related Destabilizing Activities**\nA joint statement issued in New York by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, and Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaki Takeru on Monday expressed concern over \"increasing destabilizing activities around Taiwan\" and \"strongly opposed the illegal maritime claims\" in the South China Sea and attempts to enforce them. The statement did not explicitly name China, but it comes amid heightened tensions over the South China Sea dispute, where China claims almost the entire area, overlapping the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Brookings scholars Philip Gordon and Ryan Hass, writing in Foreign Affairs, argue that Beijing\u2019s potential attack on Taiwan is a major concern: China has not abandoned its sovereignty claim over Taiwan, is building large\u2011scale military capabilities, and President Xi Jinping has instructed the development of Taiwan\u2011strike forces by 2027. The article cites Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a reminder that large\u2011scale territorial wars are possible. Analysts suggest that if China believes all other options to prevent Taiwan\u2019s permanent separation are exhausted, it may resort to military action, though China prefers a peaceful annexation to preserve the island\u2019s economic, technological and human capital. China is reportedly using propaganda, infiltration and military pressure to weaken U.S. support for Taiwan and persuade Taiwanese residents to accept Taiwan as part of China.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 02:46 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20250923001851-260408)\n\n**Who is Stirring the 'Taiwan Status Unresolved' Debate?**\nThe article reports that the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) has recently stated that the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the San\u202fFrancisco Treaty\u2014three key documents signed at the end of World War\u202fII\u2014did not determine Taiwan\u2019s final political status. AIT claims that China deliberately distorts these documents to justify its coercive actions against Taiwan. A U.S. State Department spokesperson reiterated that the United States will continue to support Taiwan against Chinese military, economic, informational, legal, and diplomatic pressure, and that the U.S. and its international partners will firmly back peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait while opposing any unilateral change of the status quo, especially by force or coercion.\n\nThe piece then reviews the historical documents: the Cairo Declaration (signed 22\u201126\u202fNov\u202f1943) declared that territories seized by Japan, including Taiwan, would be returned to the Republic of China; the Potsdam Declaration (26\u202fJul\u202f1945) reaffirmed the Cairo terms and limited Japan\u2019s sovereignty to the main islands; and the San\u202fFrancisco Treaty (signed 8\u202fSep\u202f1951, effective 28\u202fApr\u202f1952) had Japan renounce all rights to Taiwan and Penghu but did not specify the islands\u2019 ultimate status. The article argues that Taiwan\u2019s return to China is a core outcome of the war victory and the post\u2011war international order, and that the PRC\u2019s establishment in 1949 did not alter China\u2019s sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nThe author cites AIT\u2019s assertion that China\u2019s \u201cintentional distortion of WWII documents\u201d supports its coercive agenda and criticises the PRC\u2019s exclusion from the Japan peace treaty as a violation of the UN Charter and international law. The tone is strongly political, presenting the U.S. and Taiwan\u2019s positions as legitimate while portraying China\u2019s actions as illegitimate.\n\nKey quotes (single\u2011quoted as requested):\n- 'AIT\u5df2\u7d93\u6e96\u78ba\u5730\u50b3\u905e\u8a0a\u606f\uff0c\u6307\u4e2d\u570b\u523b\u610f\u626d\u66f2\u4e8c\u6230\u6642\u671f\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u4f86\u652f\u6301\u5176\u8105\u8feb\u53f0\u7063\u7684\u884c\u52d5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f81\u670d\u53f0\u7063\u3002'\n- '\u7f8e\u570b\u6703\u6301\u7e8c\u652f\u6301\u53f0\u7063\u9762\u5c0d\u4f86\u81ea\u4e2d\u570b\u7684\u8ecd\u4e8b\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u3001\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u5916\u4ea4\u7684\u65bd\u58d3\u6d3b\u52d5\uff1b\u7f8e\u570b\u8207\u570b\u969b\u7684\u5925\u4f34\u4e00\u8d77\u5805\u5b9a\u652f\u6301\u53f0\u6d77\u7684\u548c\u5e73\u548c\u7a69\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e26\u53cd\u5c0d\u4efb\u4f55\u55ae\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8b8a\u5169\u5cb8\u73fe\u72c0\u7684\u4f01\u5716\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4ee5\u6b66\u529b\u6216\u8105\u8feb\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002'\n- '\u53f0\u7063\u5c6c\u65bc\u4e2d\u570b\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u548c\u6cd5\u7406\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0d\u5bb9\u7f6e\u7591\u3002'\n\nEvidence for dates and facts is drawn directly from the article\u2019s references to the Cairo Declaration (22\u201126\u202fNov\u202f1943), Potsdam Declaration (26\u202fJul\u202f1945), San\u202fFrancisco Treaty (8\u202fSep\u202f1951/28\u202fApr\u202f1952), and the PRC\u2019s founding (1\u202fOct\u202f1949).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 01:04 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11069341)\n\n**US, South Korea, Japan Diplomats Express Concern Over Taiwan Strait**\nThe foreign ministers of South Korea, Japan and the United States issued a joint statement in Seoul expressing concern over the increasingly destabilising activities around Taiwan.

It notes that the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 2013, 2019, and 2023 failed to foresee major events such as the rise of ISIS, the COVID\u201119 pandemic, and Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel, suggesting that this year will similarly set the stage for future crises. The piece highlights the UNGA\u2019s focus on Gaza and Ukraine, describing the stalled cease\u2011fire talks in Gaza, the lack of a decisive resolution, and the continued Russian aggression in Ukraine, while noting that Washington\u2019s diplomatic efforts have not altered Putin\u2019s calculus. It contrasts this with a Beijing summit three weeks earlier, where leaders of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea\u2014forming the CRINK alliance\u2014met, with China\u2019s Xi Jinping allegedly preparing the People\u2019s Liberation Army for a potential 2027 invasion of Taiwan. The article cites a 35\u202f% probability of such an invasion according to Global Guardian\u2019s risk assessment, and warns that the CRINK alliance\u2019s growing cooperation could lower the cost of aggression for its members. It also points to the U.S.\u2013China AI race as a further destabilizing factor, arguing that 2026 could become a watershed year for global security. The article includes direct quotes: the U.S. President Trump replied, 'Esperaban que estuviera vi\u00e9ndolas', and later wrote on Truth Social, 'Saluda a Vlad\u00edmir Putin y a Kim Jong\u2011un de mi parte mientras conspiran contra Estados Unidos'.

He also said the South China Sea situation remains generally stable, that China continues to defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights, and is committed to resolving differences with relevant parties through dialogue. He urged other countries to respect the efforts of regional states to resolve issues through dialogue and maintain peace, and to stop stoking tensions.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 07:55 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8msrNhjBWue)\n\n**US, South Korea, Japan Express Concern Over Taiwan\u2011Related Destabilizing Activities**\nA joint statement issued in New York by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, and Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaki Takeru on Monday expressed concern over \"increasing destabilizing activities around Taiwan\" and \"strongly opposed the illegal maritime claims\" in the South China Sea and attempts to enforce them. The statement did not explicitly name China, but it comes amid heightened tensions over the South China Sea dispute, where China claims almost the entire area, overlapping the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Brookings scholars Philip Gordon and Ryan Hass, writing in Foreign Affairs, argue that Beijing\u2019s potential attack on Taiwan is a major concern: China has not abandoned its sovereignty claim over Taiwan, is building large\u2011scale military capabilities, and President Xi Jinping has instructed the development of Taiwan\u2011strike forces by 2027. The article cites Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a reminder that large\u2011scale territorial wars are possible. Analysts suggest that if China believes all other options to prevent Taiwan\u2019s permanent separation are exhausted, it may resort to military action, though China prefers a peaceful annexation to preserve the island\u2019s economic, technological and human capital. China is reportedly using propaganda, infiltration and military pressure to weaken U.S. support for Taiwan and persuade Taiwanese residents to accept Taiwan as part of China.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 02:46 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20250923001851-260408)\n\n**Who is Stirring the 'Taiwan Status Unresolved' Debate?**\nThe article reports that the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) has recently stated that the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the San\u202fFrancisco Treaty\u2014three key documents signed at the end of World War\u202fII\u2014did not determine Taiwan\u2019s final political status. AIT claims that China deliberately distorts these documents to justify its coercive actions against Taiwan. A U.S. State Department spokesperson reiterated that the United States will continue to support Taiwan against Chinese military, economic, informational, legal, and diplomatic pressure, and that the U.S. and its international partners will firmly back peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait while opposing any unilateral change of the status quo, especially by force or coercion.\n\nThe piece then reviews the historical documents: the Cairo Declaration (signed 22\u201126\u202fNov\u202f1943) declared that territories seized by Japan, including Taiwan, would be returned to the Republic of China; the Potsdam Declaration (26\u202fJul\u202f1945) reaffirmed the Cairo terms and limited Japan\u2019s sovereignty to the main islands; and the San\u202fFrancisco Treaty (signed 8\u202fSep\u202f1951, effective 28\u202fApr\u202f1952) had Japan renounce all rights to Taiwan and Penghu but did not specify the islands\u2019 ultimate status. The article argues that Taiwan\u2019s return to China is a core outcome of the war victory and the post\u2011war international order, and that the PRC\u2019s establishment in 1949 did not alter China\u2019s sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nThe author cites AIT\u2019s assertion that China\u2019s \u201cintentional distortion of WWII documents\u201d supports its coercive agenda and criticises the PRC\u2019s exclusion from the Japan peace treaty as a violation of the UN Charter and international law. The tone is strongly political, presenting the U.S. and Taiwan\u2019s positions as legitimate while portraying China\u2019s actions as illegitimate.\n\nKey quotes (single\u2011quoted as requested):\n- 'AIT\u5df2\u7d93\u6e96\u78ba\u5730\u50b3\u905e\u8a0a\u606f\uff0c\u6307\u4e2d\u570b\u523b\u610f\u626d\u66f2\u4e8c\u6230\u6642\u671f\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u4f86\u652f\u6301\u5176\u8105\u8feb\u53f0\u7063\u7684\u884c\u52d5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f81\u670d\u53f0\u7063\u3002'\n- '\u7f8e\u570b\u6703\u6301\u7e8c\u652f\u6301\u53f0\u7063\u9762\u5c0d\u4f86\u81ea\u4e2d\u570b\u7684\u8ecd\u4e8b\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u3001\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u5916\u4ea4\u7684\u65bd\u58d3\u6d3b\u52d5\uff1b\u7f8e\u570b\u8207\u570b\u969b\u7684\u5925\u4f34\u4e00\u8d77\u5805\u5b9a\u652f\u6301\u53f0\u6d77\u7684\u548c\u5e73\u548c\u7a69\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e26\u53cd\u5c0d\u4efb\u4f55\u55ae\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8b8a\u5169\u5cb8\u73fe\u72c0\u7684\u4f01\u5716\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4ee5\u6b66\u529b\u6216\u8105\u8feb\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002'\n- '\u53f0\u7063\u5c6c\u65bc\u4e2d\u570b\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u548c\u6cd5\u7406\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0d\u5bb9\u7f6e\u7591\u3002'\n\nEvidence for dates and facts is drawn directly from the article\u2019s references to the Cairo Declaration (22\u201126\u202fNov\u202f1943), Potsdam Declaration (26\u202fJul\u202f1945), San\u202fFrancisco Treaty (8\u202fSep\u202f1951/28\u202fApr\u202f1952), and the PRC\u2019s founding (1\u202fOct\u202f1949).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 01:04 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11069341)\n\n**Taiwan detects 3 Chinese aircraft and 4 naval vessels near its territory - The Statesman**\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defence (MND) reported that on Monday, three sorties of People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft and four PLAN vessels were detected operating around the island until 6 a.m. (UTC+8), according to a post on X. The MND said, '3 sorties of PLA aircraft and 4 PLAN vessels operating around #Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8) today. #ROCArmedForces have monitored the situation and responded accordingly.' The previous day, the MND recorded two sorties of PLA aircraft and six PLAN vessels, with the MND stating, '2 sorties of PLA aircraft and 6 PLAN vessels operating around #Taiwan were detected up until 6 am today. #ROCArmedForces have monitored the situation and responded accordingly.' These frequent incursions reflect rising tensions between Taiwan and China, rooted in the 'One China' principle that China claims Taiwan as part of its territory. Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), maintains de facto independence with its own political and economic systems, while China seeks reunification through military, diplomatic, and economic pressure. The MND continues to monitor and publicly report such movements to ensure transparency and national security.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:50 AM\nSource:[The Statesman](https://www.thestatesman.com/world/taiwan-detects-3-chinese-aircraft-and-4-naval-vessels-near-its-territory-1503489622.html)\n\n**Tension in the Pacific: Australian and Canadian warships cross Taiwan Strait as Chinese regime deploys surveillance operation**\nOn 6 September 2025, the Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Qu\u00e9bec and the Australian destroyer HMAS Brisbane transited the Taiwan Strait, prompting a full surveillance operation by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). According to a source cited by Global Times, the PLA maintained full control during the passage. The Chinese regime labeled the operation a 'provocation' and said the ships 'caused problems' in a strategic scenario for its interests. Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the PLA's Eastern Theater Command, said the transit 'caused problems and provoked' and that the actions 'send wrong signals and increase security risks'. Chinese authorities maintain that Taiwan is part of its territory and have not ruled out using force to take control of the island, stating that 'Chinese troops remain on maximum alert at all times, resolutely safeguarding national sovereignty and security, as well as regional peace and stability'. The Taiwan status dispute dates back to 1949, when the civil war ended and the People's Republic of China was established, leaving the defeated government confined to the island as the Republic of China. Washington and its allies, including Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, have intensified their presence in the strait through regular military vessel passages. In June, a British vessel's transit prompted China to express discontent, arguing that such maneuvers 'undermine peace and stability' in the area. Taipei rejects Chinese claims and asserts its autonomy with strategic and military backing from Western powers.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 05:07 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/09/06/tension-en-el-pacifico-buques-de-guerra-de-australia-y-canada-cruzaron-el-estrecho-de-taiwan-y-el-regimen-chino-desplego-un-operativo-de-vigilancia/)\n\n**China Condemns UK Defense Minister's Words on Taiwan**\nChina's Ministry of Defense has condemned the words of British Defense Minister John Healey about the country's readiness to defend Taiwan. During a visit to Australia, Healey was asked by a Telegraph journalist about the possibility of helping Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China. Healey tried to avoid answering, saying that 'if we have to fight, as we did in the past, Australia and the UK will fight together', and that the two countries conduct joint exercises, which helps them 'be a deterrent force.' Healey also emphasized that he is speaking in 'general terms', noting that the UK would prefer to resolve disputes in the Indo-Pacific region 'peacefully' and 'diplomatically.' When asked if London is ready to establish official relations with Taiwan, Healey stated that 'at the moment, the UK is not considering a change in its stance on Taiwan.' In response, China's Ministry of Defense called for the UK to be cautious in its words and actions regarding Taiwan, saying that 'Britain should not send false signals to separatist forces seeking 'Taiwan's independence', undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.' Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogan, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense, said, 'No one should underestimate the unshakeable will and ability of the People's Liberation Army of China to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.' The situation around Taiwan has escalated since the visit of Nancy Pelosi, then Speaker of the US House of Representatives, to the island in August 2022. China, which considers the island part of its territory, condemned the visit, viewing it as support for US-backed Taiwanese separatism, and conducted large-scale military exercises. Since then, China has repeatedly conducted exercises around the island, involving different types of troops, including aircraft carrier groups, claiming that these actions are absolutely lawful, necessary, and reasonable. Taiwan also conducts annual exercises, strengthening contacts with the US and continuing to purchase arms from it to enhance its defense capabilities and 'defend democracy.' The US maintains a policy of 'strategic ambiguity' towards Taiwan, not providing a clear official response as to whether it will provide military aid to Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[\u041f\u0420\u0410\u0419\u041c](https://1prime.ru/20250730/kitay-860132969.html)\n\n**Allied Countries Prepare Response to Possible Chinese Invasion of Taiwan**\nAllied countries are preparing a response to a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, but some have doubts about their commitment. In the Pacific, large-scale military exercises have been held, considered the largest and most sophisticated since World War II, signaling growing unease over China's military rise. The exercises aim to persuade Beijing that an invasion of Taiwan would risk war not only with the US, but also with a powerful and well-armed alliance of countries. However, the US, Australia, and the Philippines have no binding obligations to defend Taiwan under a treaty, despite diplomatic pressure from the US. According to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, US administrations have committed to having plans and military resources to protect the island from any Chinese threat. However, behind the scenes, there is a clear diplomatic discomfort, caused by the frustrations of the Pacific region over Trump's tariffs and trade war, as well as strategic uncertainty about the US and its future global role. As Lieutenant General Joel Vowell, deputy commander of the US Army in the Pacific, said, 'We're not looking for a fight, but we're prepared to defend our allies and our interests.' The exercise involves 35,000 soldiers from 19 different nationalities, including the UK and Canada, which could provide support through sanctions or logistics. Other countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands could provide diplomatic support or sanctions, but it is less likely that they would participate militarily. China has gained significant support in the international community, with 70 countries officially adopting its narrative, accepting its right to use 'all means' to achieve reunification with Taiwan. 89 countries would accept Chinese military action without condemning it in the UN. 119 countries (62% of UN members) recognize China's sovereignty over Taiwan, although without explicitly supporting the use of force.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 28, 2025 05:39 AM\nSource:[as](https://as.com/actualidad/politica/paises-aliados-preparan-la-respuesta-ante-una-posible-invasion-china-en-taiwan-aunque-algunos-dejan-dudas-sobre-su-compromiso-n/)\n\n**Taiwan: A Strategic and Political Symbol**\nTaiwan, a strategic and political symbol, has begun large-scale military exercises in response to China's threat of invasion. The exercises are significant this year because in April, China simulated an invasion of Taiwan and President Xi Jinping ordered his army to be ready to invade by 2027. If China were to control Taiwan, its navy could freely extend into the Pacific. Taiwan is preparing for this scenario with annual military exercises, which started yesterday and will last nine days. The residents of Taipei will also receive an order to take shelter during an air alert exercise next week. Taiwan is investing in a conflict with drones, autonomous systems, and cyber defenses, inspired by Ukraine. China wants the world to see Taiwan as a 'Chinese internal problem', but Taiwan is a democracy of 23 million people with free elections, an independent press, and a cutting-edge industry. Reducing Taiwan's reality to a simple sovereignty conflict ignores its resilient civil society and the determination of its people to defend their freedoms. The danger is that even Western partners fall into this narrative trap by treating Taiwan as a 'permanent provocation' instead of a stabilizing actor in the Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan concentrates nearly 60% of the world's semiconductor production and 92% of the most advanced chips. A disruption in its production chain would cause global economic waves. However, recent university studies show that this concentration is also a vulnerability: a simple blockade, piracy, or local conflict could stop significant parts of the global economy. The US and Europeans officially support Taipei but seek to diversify their sources of supply. The tensions are not only played out in the strait but also in the factories. Taiwan is not just a powder keg and military issue, but also a key economy and a democracy standing as a counter-model to China's authoritarian regime. While China wants to impose a single narrative, Taipei is preparing its future - between deterrence, alliances, and political affirmation. The real question is not whether China will attack, but whether the rest of the world is ready to see Taiwan for what it is: not a risk, but a symbol.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 06:45 AM\nSource:[Radio France](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/podcasts/geopolitique/geopolitique-du-jeudi-10-juillet-2025-7261420)\n\n**Taiwanese Vice Foreign Minister Calls China's Military Exercises a 'Rehearsal for Invasion'**\nTensions in the Taiwan Strait continue to escalate as China's People's Liberation Army increases its military deployment around the island. In recent days, Taiwanese authorities have reported that 27 aircraft have crossed the median line that divides the territorial waters of both countries. According to data from the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense, there were 3067 air incursions in 2024, an 80% increase from the previous year. The Taiwanese government expressed concern over the intensification of Beijing's provocations, with Vice Foreign Minister Ming-Chi Chen stating, 'They are conducting these so-called 'military exercises' more frequently, but Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, has expressed his fear that some of these exercises may have another purpose and be, in fact, a rehearsal for an invasion.' The Chinese government responded harshly to President Lai Ching-te's statement that China is a 'hostile foreign force' and launched a series of measures to prevent military infiltration and espionage. Chen also stated that Taiwan's independence is incompatible with peace in the strait. Taiwan rejects China's rhetoric, considering the island a 'province in rebellion' that will eventually be reincorporated into the territory of the People's Republic. Taiwan seeks to participate in international organizations, including the World Health Organization, and has proposed a 'democratic supply chain' to strengthen its alliance with countries that share its values.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 08:08 AM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/def/2025/05/31/def-en-taiwan-el-vicecanciller-califico-los-ejercicios-militares-chinos-como-un-ensayo-de-invasion-de-la-isla/)\n\n**US Warns of Possible Chinese Advance Against Taiwan- Controlled Islands**\nThe US Defense Intelligence Agency has warned that China may advance against these islands, according to a recent report. The report, 'Global Threat Assessment 2024', states that China is evaluating options that include taking islands such as Kinmen, Matsu, Dongsha, Taiping, or Penghu. These islands are seen by China as critical points to exert coercion against Taiwan, while also testing the reaction of the United States. 'China has a variety of military options to coerce Taiwan, including the taking of smaller peripheral islands,' the official document notes. The strategic location of these islands makes them priority targets. The Institute for the Study of War notes that China is already implementing a tactic known as the 'gray zone', combining economic pressure, legal warfare, disinformation campaigns, and militarized infrastructure construction. This strategy aims to erode Taiwan's influence without crossing the line into direct confrontation. Although a general invasion of Taiwan is not expected in the next few years, the People's Liberation Army continues to develop military capabilities to weaken the island's autonomy. The report warns that any action against the peripheral islands also aims to test Washington's commitment to its ally in the Pacific. 'This type of maneuver would also seek to undermine the United States' willingness to intervene in defense of the island,' the text notes. Meanwhile, China maintains a multifaceted campaign of diplomatic blockades, naval maneuvers, and economic measures to prevent any formal progress towards Taiwanese independence. For Beijing, Taiwan is an inseparable part of its territory, and its 'national reunification' is part of the ambitious national rejuvenation plan driven by President Xi Jinping.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 06:42 AM\nSource:[Mundo Deportivo](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/us/actualidad/20250530/723827/estados-unidos-vs-china-guerra-desatar-posible-invasion-islas.html)\n\n**US Defense Intelligence Agency Warns of China's Increased Military Threats Against Taiwan**\nThe US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has released a report warning that China may increase its military threats against Taiwan this year, including sea and air blockades, and the capture of Taiwan's outlying islands. According to the report, China's strategic goal is to become the strongest country in East Asia, challenge the US's global leadership, and unify Taiwan, while also improving China's economic development and resilience. The report states that China is closely monitoring US policy changes and may be preparing measures to prevent, thwart, and retaliate against the US. China may also continue to apply pressure on the Philippines, Taiwan, and other countries that resist China's territorial claims. The report notes that China has been conducting network attacks on US critical infrastructure, and if China believes a major conflict with the US is imminent, it may launch a cyber attack. The report does not believe that China will launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan in 2025, but warns that China may increase its attacks on Taiwan's outlying islands. The report states that China has several military options to continue threatening Taiwan, including the capture of outlying islands such as Kinmen, Matsu, Dongsha, Taiping, and Penghu. China will continue to use 'diplomatic, informational, military, and economic pressure' to intimidate Taiwan and achieve its 'unification' goal, and test the US's commitment to defending Taiwan. The report states that China has multiple military means to coerce Taiwan, including increasing the frequency and scope of military actions, implementing sea and air blockades, capturing outlying islands, and conducting joint firepower attacks, as well as a full-scale amphibious invasion. A war observer warns that Kinmen and Matsu are particularly vulnerable areas of Taiwan's territory. The report also notes that China seems willing to put off using force to take Taiwan, but only if it believes that it can achieve unification through negotiation, and that the cost of using force would be too high. The DIA also states that China will test the US's commitment to defending Taiwan. Although Taiwan and the US do not have a formal military treaty, and even no diplomatic relations, Washington expects to respond to any Chinese attack on Taiwan, and will use Guam as a transit point for such actions. The Washington think tank 'Institute for the Study of War' (ISW) in last year's assessment noted that 'Beijing is currently trying to annex Kinmen and Matsu through a combination of economic enticements, non-violent coercion, legal warfare, information operations, infrastructure development, and various 'gray zone' tactics to manipulate public opinion on the island and erode Taiwan's control over its territory.' The ISW also warned that China may 'increase the current level of military activity, using short-term war-threatening actions to erode Taiwan's sovereignty over Kinmen Island, and in the short term, seize control of the island.' Guam Governor Lourdes A Leon Guerrero recently visited Taiwan, which is her first visit to Taiwan since taking office in 2019. As Guam is a US Pacific territory, it is almost certain to be a key participant in China's military actions against Taiwan. In the past two years, China has significantly increased its military pressure on Taiwan, frequently conducting military exercises around Taiwan Island, and sending ships and aircraft across the Taiwan Strait median line. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 01:44 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/5/28/n14519632.htm)\n\n**China could grab Taiwan's outer islands, claims intelligence report | Taiwan News | May. 28, 2025 16:59**\nA US intelligence report, released by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), warns that China may seize Taiwan's outlying islands, such as Kinmen, Matsu, Dongsha, Taiping Island, or Penghu, to pressure Taipei and test Washington's resolve. The report states that China possesses various military options, including increasing military presence operations, air and maritime blockades, and joint firepower strikes. While a full-scale invasion is not anticipated this year, the report warns that China may ramp up its activities around Taiwan's offshore territories. The DIA also notes that China will likely continue to use diplomatic, information, military, and economic pressure to coerce Taiwan into unification. According to the report, China will test Washington's resolve to defend Taiwan, with Guam serving as the primary staging ground for military operations.

While the report does not predict a full-scale invasion of Taiwan in 2025, it warns that China may increase its attacks on Taiwan's outlying islands. According to the report, 'China has a range of military means at its disposal to coerce Taiwan, including increasing the frequency and scope of military deployments, implementing sea and air blockades, seizing Taiwan's outlying islands, and conducting joint firepower attacks, up to and including a full amphibious landing invasion of Taiwan.' The report also notes that China may be willing to postpone the use of force to take Taiwan if it believes that it can achieve reunification through negotiations, and that Taiwan or its allies have not crossed China's 'red lines.' The US Defense Intelligence Agency also warns that China will continue to use 'diplomatic, informational, military, and economic pressure' to coerce Taiwan into achieving its long-term goal of 'unification.' Furthermore, the report suggests that China will test the US commitment to defending Taiwan. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has previously warned that Kinmen and Matsu are the most vulnerable areas of Taiwan's territory. According to the ISW, 'Beijing is currently attempting to annex Kinmen and Matsu through a combination of economic incentives, non-violent coercion, legal warfare, information warfare, infrastructure development, and various 'gray zone' strategies, in an effort to manipulate local opinion, undermine Taiwan's control over these territories, and ultimately seize control of them.' The ISW warns that China may 'escalate its current lines of effort (LOEs) to achieve a coercive outcome in a non-war level of conflict, undermining Taiwan's sovereignty over these islands and ultimately seizing control of them.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 04:53 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6656/8769685)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014ranging from military strategy, intelligence analysis, diplomatic practice, international relations, security studies, and Chinese area studies\u2014the consensus is overwhelming: the probability of a full-scale Chinese invasion of Taiwan in the remainder of 2025 is extremely low, with probability estimates ranging from 2% to 7%, and clustering predominantly at 2\u20134%. \n\nKey reasons uniting these assessments include:\n- The current and historical base rate for amphibious invasions, especially against well-defended, U.S.-supported islands, is near zero since 1949.\n- All available intelligence, media reporting, and open-source analysis indicate no observable PLA mass mobilization, logistical buildup, or covert preparations required for an imminent invasion. Chinese military activities, while elevated, mainly take the form of coercive signaling, gray-zone operations, and rehearsals without crossing the invasion threshold.\n- US, Japanese, South Korean, Australian, and allied deterrence postures are robust, with frequent joint military exercises and diplomatic signaling raising the expected costs of invasion for China.\n- Xi Jinping's stated 2027 readiness goal is referenced across expert domains, pointing to a longer timeline for potential military action; there is little to no evidence that 2025 is seen as an operational deadline in Beijing.\n- Political and economic risks for China are immense: a failed or costly invasion would risk regime stability, trigger devastating sanctions, and disrupt global supply chains (in particular semiconductors).\n- Most experts note the higher likelihood of limited escalation, such as seizures or blockades of peripheral islands (Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu), rather than a full-scale main-island assault\u2014a scenario not sufficient to trigger a \"Yes\" outcome under the forecasting criteria.\n- The only scenarios experts see as raising the probability above the very low baseline are black swan events: a dramatic political crisis in China, a formal Taiwanese independence move, or a catastrophic miscalculation\u2014but none of these are currently visible or likely before the question closes.\n- Diplomatic and crisis management channels (Track Two and Track One) remain open, further reducing the risk of uncontrolled escalation.\n\nIn sum: There is a strong group consensus that, absent an unforeseeable and dramatic trigger event, China will not invade Taiwan in 2025, and all indicators point to a continuation of gray-zone tactics and military signaling rather than full-scale war in the next 2.5 months. The base rates, operational realities, and deterrence dynamics all support a very low probability for a 2025 PLA invasion meeting the resolution criteria.",
