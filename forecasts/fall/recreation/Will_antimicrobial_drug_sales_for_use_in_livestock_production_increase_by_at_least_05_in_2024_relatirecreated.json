Furthermore, innovations in diagnostics and vaccines are increasingly available. The global veterinary pharmaceuticals and anti-infectives market is growing, but much of this is due to expansion in emerging markets or in non-antibiotic categories. Overall, while there is a plausible risk of a temporary uptick due to disease outbreaks, the weight of evidence and policy inertia favors continued flat or declining US sales.

The base rate, reinforced by recent FDA data and global stewardship trends, points to a much lower chance of reversal."

The report cites a 2025\u20112032 CAGR of 6.7% and a 2025 market size of US$ 4,830.7\u202fmillion, with a 2032 projection of US$ 7,620.1\u202fmillion.  It attributes the expansion to rising hospital\u2011acquired infections (HAIs), the prevalence of multidrug\u2011resistant organisms such as MRSA and CRE, and advances in molecular diagnostics, including PCR, next\u2011generation sequencing (NGS) and AI\u2011powered tools.  The release notes that the World Health Organization estimates that AMR could cause 10\u202fmillion deaths annually by 2050 if left unchecked, underscoring the urgency of diagnostic innovation.  Key drivers highlighted include the adoption of rapid, point\u2011of\u2011care (PoC) testing and the integration of AI and bioinformatics to accelerate detection.  Restraints identified are the limited availability of new antibiotics and the continued reliance on empirical therapy, which can dampen the uptake of diagnostic tools.  Opportunities focus on AI integration, PoC deployment in resource\u2011limited settings, and antimicrobial stewardship programs.  Regionally, North America is positioned as the market leader due to advanced infrastructure and regulatory support, while Europe, Asia\u2011Pacific, and the Middle East are projected to experience significant growth driven by regulatory mandates and rising infection burdens.  The report lists major players such as Abbott Laboratories, Bio\u2011Rad Laboratories, Thermo Fisher Scientific, BD, Roche, and bioM\u00e9rieux, and cites recent developments like bioM\u00e9rieux\u2019s FDA clearance of the VITEK\u00ae COMPACT PRO system in March\u202f2025.

The authors argue that changes can be effected through amendments to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act & Rules.  A survey of doctors in tertiary care hospitals found that most prescribe antibiotics responsibly, yet misuse, abuse and over\u2011the\u2011counter sales continue to drive AMR.  In 2019, between 3 and 10.4\u202flakh people died in India from bacterial AMR, according to the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project.  The paper notes that over the past decade, all newly introduced antimicrobials failed to show improved effectiveness against multidrug\u2011resistant gram\u2011negative pathogens, underscoring the urgent need for new treatment options such as plazomicin, cefiderocol and novel \u03b2\u2011lactam combinations.  The GRAM report also reported 6,86,908 deaths linked to six major superbugs (E.\u202fcoli, K.\u202fpneumoniae, S.\u202faureus, A.\u202fbaumannii, M.\u202ftuberculosis, S.\u202fpneumoniae), with over 2.14\u202flakh attributable deaths.  Resistance data show K.\u202fpneumoniae has 62.3\u202f% resistance to carbapenem meropenem; E.\u202fcoli\u2019s susceptibility to imipenem fell from 81\u202f% in 2017 to 63\u202f% in 2023, and to piperacillin\u2011tazobactam from 56.8\u202f% to 42.4\u202f%.  K.\u202fpneumoniae isolates had only 26.5\u202f% susceptibility to piperacillin\u2011tazobactam in 2023.  Consequently, clinicians are increasingly prescribing polymyxins such as colistin, but rising colistin use is driving resistance to this last\u2011resort drug.  Since the 2011 National Policy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance, India has introduced Schedule\u202fH1 to restrict over\u2011the\u2011counter sales, launched a red\u2011line campaign on drug packages, and periodically revised the National List of Essential Medicines, though implementation challenges limit success.  The TB programme offers a model of robust stewardship: new TB drugs (bedaquiline, delamanid, pretomanid) are dispensed only through DOTS\u2011Plus centres, with diagnostics performed by accredited labs.  Dr Aravind\u202fR., head of infectious diseases at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, said, 'I think reserve category antibiotics should only be available in hospital formularies. Also, pharmaceutical companies should be barred from offering free samples of antibiotics to physicians as they end up with patients.'  WHO\u2019s AWaRe classification divides antibiotics into access, watch and reserve groups; a 2024 government report found that 57\u202f% of reserve antibiotics prescribed in India are those with high potential for resistance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/health/as-antibiotics-turn-ineffective-against-deadly-superbugs-icmr-wants-curbs-on-their-sale/2743741/)\n\n**Anticoccidial Drugs Market: Major Trends Reshaping the Future of the Industry**\nThe press release titled 'Anticoccidial Drugs Market: Major Trends Reshaping the Future of the Industry' reports that the global anticoccidial drugs market was valued at $1.27\u202fbillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.35\u202fbillion in 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% (source: article).

The research estimates that an improved pipeline of antimicrobics targeting Gram\u2011negative bacteria could save 11\u202fmillion lives by 2050. It examined annual revenue and volume data for two representative antibiotics\u2014cefiderocol and ceftazidime\u2011avibactam\u2014using sales figures from IQVIA (2015\u20112024). Three scenarios were modelled: low, intermediate and high, with the intermediate set at roughly US$363\u202fmillion per year per drug, adjusted for inflation. The study found that the G7\u2011EU27 bloc did not meet its medium\u2011term cumulative targets. The United Kingdom achieved its medium\u2011term goals through a subscription\u2011style \u2018pay\u2011for\u2011access\u2019 programme that guarantees a fixed annual payment to manufacturers regardless of sales volume.

The review notes that infections caused by methicillin\u2011resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* and carbapenem\u2011resistant Gram\u2011negative bacteria will drive the greatest increase in disease burden. It also highlights the emergence of antifungal resistance, underscored by the WHO fungal priority pathogen list released in 2022. Modelling a scenario that improves patient care\u2014including optimized antimicrobial use, vaccination, sepsis detection and infection prevention and control\u2014suggests that 92\u202fmillion deaths could be prevented between 2025 and 2050. In the agricultural sector, the report warns that annual livestock production losses could match the consumption needs of 746\u202fmillion to 2\u202fbillion people, and could cause a cumulative global gross domestic product loss of US$575\u2011953\u202fbillion by 2050. The review stresses that antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) must be integrated across human, animal and environmental health, addressing data and surveillance gaps, implementation barriers, sociocultural drivers, digital innovation and the inclusion of low\u2011 and middle\u2011income countries. It calls for a One\u202fHealth approach that balances stewardship goals with patient safety, mitigates environmental contamination from pharmaceutical effluents, and reduces the carbon footprint of antimicrobials through improved hygiene, vaccination, diagnostics and outpatient management.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01233-3)\n\n**Farm Animal Drugs Market Share, CAGR, and Forecast by Region and Segment (2025-2029) In New Report**\nThe farm animal drugs market is projected to grow from $19.41\u202fbillion in 2024 to $20.66\u202fbillion in 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% (source: article).

It is here, it is growing, and it could soon become one of the biggest killers in the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has repeatedly warned that if nothing changes, resistant infections could kill more people globally than cancer by 2050. The danger is particularly acute in sub\u2011Saharan Africa, where drug regulation is weaker and antibiotics are used widely in both human health and agriculture.\n\nKenya is already facing this reality. The Ministry of Health has identified AMR as a national public health crisis, noting that common bacterial infections are becoming harder to treat with standard medicines. Doctors are increasingly reporting cases where antibiotics that used to work fail, necessitating the use of more expensive or less accessible drugs. The causes extend far beyond hospitals.\n\nOne of the major drivers of resistance is the way antibiotics are used in food\u2011producing animals. Research by the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership in Kenya has shown that about 80 per cent of livestock households regularly use antibiotics, and an astonishing 95 per cent obtain them without prescriptions.\n\nMany farmers use these drugs not just to treat illness but also to promote growth and prevent disease in healthy animals. Withdrawal periods, the mandatory time between treatment and slaughter, are often ignored, which means residues end up in meat sold to consumers. Studies show that although awareness of AMR among farmers is relatively high, with most able to correctly answer basic questions about it, this knowledge does not necessarily change behaviour.\n\nGlobally, organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) have sounded the alarm on the agricultural link to resistance. In Zimbabwe and Zambia, for instance, Farmer Field Schools supported by FAO have helped small\u2011scale poultry farmers improve hygiene and biosecurity, reducing their reliance on antibiotics.\n\nThese initiatives are part of the wider \u2018One Health\u2019 approach that recognises human, animal and environmental health as interconnected, and that tackling AMR requires coordinated action across all three.\n\nKenya has attempted to follow this path through its National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, launched in 2017 and now in its second phase. The plan committed the government to expand surveillance, strengthen regulation of drug use and improve public awareness.\n\nCounty\u2011level AMR committees have been set up to bring together the health, agriculture and environmental sectors. Yet experts warn that progress has been uneven, particularly in informal markets where much of the country\u2019s meat is sold. In these settings, regulation is weak, veterinary oversight is minimal, and consumers have little information about what they are eating.\n\nThis is where private sector practices can make a difference, even if they cannot replace public policy. Kenchic, Kenya\u2019s largest poultry processor, has adopted a farm\u2011to\u2011family traceability system that tracks meat back through breeder farms and hatcheries.\n\nThe company is the only African organisation recognised by the International Poultry Council for antimicrobial stewardship, and it holds FSSC\u202f22000 food safety certification. Products are tested regularly for microbial contamination, and customer complaints are resolved within two days.\n\n'We are highly regulated in terms of antibiotic use,' says Brenda Njeri, the company\u2019s Factory Manager. 'The measures we have in place are designed to ensure our products are antimicrobial free.' She adds that Kenchic can trace any chicken cut back to the grandparent flock it came from, giving consumers confidence about safety and origin.\n\nNjeri also emphasises the role of consumers in shaping the food system. 'Please, ask what you eat. What you eat makes you who you are. Health is key to sustainability, so whatever we offer the society must also keep it healthy.'\n\nAlun Meskel, Head of Plant Operations, is more direct about the risks elsewhere in the industry.\n\n'A good number of farmers focus so much on profitability, they pump chicken with antibiotics to prevent them from getting sick,' he says. 'By the time the chicken is slaughtered, you are buying meat that has traces of antibiotics in it. And when people fall ill, the medication they take may no longer work because they've unknowingly built resistance over time.'\n\nMeskel explains that Kenchic\u2019s long\u2011term goal is to reach antibiotic\u2011free production, a standard that only a handful of organisations worldwide are pursuing. 'Our ultimate goal is to have antibiotic\u2011free production. It is a very ambitious project, but it is the only way forward,' he says.\n\nBoth managers stress that animal welfare is closely tied to food safety. Birds are raised without cages, allowed to walk freely, and even given perches and toys to simulate a natural environment. 'When animals are stressed during transport or slaughter, the meat quality is affected. Relaxed animals produce safer and better food,' Meskel notes.\n\nHe also points out that chicken is not only affordable but one of the healthiest proteins available. 'Gram for gram, chicken has the highest protein and the least fat. It is good for you and can be eaten every day,' he says.\n\nThese insights highlight the gap between best practice and the broader market. While a company like Kenchic may offer consumers assurances, the reality is that most Kenyans still buy their meat from informal traders who lack such systems. Without stronger regulation, routine monitoring and clearer labelling, the public remains exposed to hidden risks.\n\nThe danger is not just theoretical. Resistant bacteria do not stay confined to farms, they can spread through food, water and the environment, undermining the effectiveness of antibiotics when people need them most. The Ministry of Health warns that the cost of inaction will be measured not only in money but in lives lost.\n\nIn the meantime, every plate of meat carries an unspoken question: what is really in it, and what might it mean for our health tomorrow.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 24, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[Standard Digital News - Kenya](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001527679/antibiotic-epidemic-how-meat-is-making-our-medicines-useless)\n\n**Japan Colistin Sulphate Market Strategies to Maximize Growth and Profitability, Forecast 2025 to 2032**\nThe Colistin Sulphate market is expected to grow significantly, driven by its critical role in combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, particularly in the animal health sector. The market is anticipated to reach an approximate valuation of USD 280 million by 2025, with projections indicating a substantial expansion to around USD 410 million by 2032. This growth trajectory represents a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.6% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2032. The market's growth is driven by the escalating global challenge of antimicrobial resistance and the persistent demand for effective therapeutic solutions in both veterinary and, in specific cases, human medicine. The Colistin Sulphate market is poised for robust growth in the coming years, driven by the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections in both livestock and, critically, human health. The market faces significant challenges, notably the global push for reduced antibiotic use in animal agriculture due to concerns over antimicrobial resistance and its potential transfer to humans. However, opportunities arise from the ongoing innovation in diagnostic technologies, enabling more precise and targeted use, and the development of new formulations that could potentially mitigate adverse effects or enhance efficacy, ensuring its continued, albeit strategic, role. The future scope of the Colistin Sulphate market will heavily lean towards more precise, diagnostic-driven applications of Colistin Sulphate, guided by robust antimicrobial stewardship programs, especially in veterinary medicine, to preserve its efficacy and minimize resistance development. Research into new formulations and delivery systems, combination therapies, and emphasis on surveillance and diagnostics will shape its future, ensuring its continued relevance as a crucial last-resort treatment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 03:21 PM\nSource:[prsync.com](http://prsync.com/market-research-update/japan-colistin-sulphate-market-strategies-to-maximize-growth-and-profitability-forecast--to--4899915/)\n\n**Taraba Govt raises alarm over antimicrobial resistance in livestock**\nThe Taraba State Government has raised concerns over the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in livestock treatment, warning it could impact food security and farmers' livelihoods.

The report highlights the increasing risks to human health, with the number of outbreaks of avian influenza in mammals more than doubling in 2024, from 459 to 1,022 in 55 countries. Almost half of the animal diseases reported over the past 18 years have the potential to be transmitted to humans. Emmanuelle Soubeyran, Woah's director-general, stated, 'The spread, prevalence, and impact of animal diseases are changing rapidly, posing new and complex challenges not only for animal health, but also for agriculture, food safety, public health, and the protection of natural ecosystems.' The report also notes the resurgence of diseases considered endemic in specific regions in entirely new areas, such as the reappearance of the sheep and goat plague in Europe and the spread of the African swine fever to Sri Lanka. The report identifies climate change and the intensification of global trade as key drivers of this new geography of animal diseases. 'Prevention remains the most effective tool,' the report emphasizes, highlighting the unequal access to vaccines for livestock as a major criticism. Vaccination, along with sanitary and biosafety measures, is recommended as the key tool to prevent epidemics, reduce antibiotic use, and combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance. The report also notes a 5% decrease in the use of antibiotics in animals between 2020 and 2022, with the EU leading the trend (-23%), followed by Africa (-20%). However, one in five countries continues to use antibiotics as growth promoters, a practice strongly discouraged by Woah. According to estimates, if urgent action is not taken, antimicrobial resistance could cause livestock losses that would compromise the food security of two billion people by 2050, with economic damages exceeding $100 trillion.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 03:37 PM\nSource:[lastampa.it](https://www.lastampa.it/la-zampa/2025/05/26/news/primo_rapporto_mondiale_salute_animale_whoa_aviaria_raddoppia-424630443/)\n\n**Woah Report: Animal Diseases on the Rise, Threatening Human Health**\nThe World Organisation for Animal Health (Woah) has released a report highlighting the changing trends and risks of animal diseases. The report states that almost half of the animal diseases that are migrating to new areas have the potential to jump to humans. The influenza aviaria has been particularly concerning, with a significant increase in outbreaks in mammals in 2024 compared to 2023, increasing the risk of further transmission and human infection. The report also notes that the adoption and availability of vaccines for animals is uneven worldwide, and that the use of antibiotics in animals remains a major concern. Emmanuelle Soubeyran, Woah's director-general, said, 'The diffusion, prevalence, and impact of animal infectious diseases are changing, bringing new challenges for agriculture and food safety, human health and development, and natural ecosystems.' The report calls for increased international cooperation and access to safe and effective vaccines, as well as other control measures. According to the report, the use of antimicrobials in animals decreased by 5% between 2020 and 2022, but one in five countries still uses them as growth promoters, a practice discouraged by Woah.

The report warns that the risk of the virus spreading to humans has increased. According to the report, there were 1,022 animal influenza outbreaks in 55 countries in 2024, up from 459 in 2023. While the risk of human infection remains low, the virus has become more adaptable to spreading between animals, increasing the likelihood of transmission to humans. The report notes that nearly half of the animal diseases reported to the OIE between 2005 and 2023 are considered to pose a threat to human health due to their zoonotic potential. This is attributed to climate change and increased animal trade. The report emphasizes the importance of preventing animal diseases in reducing antibiotic use and combating antimicrobial resistance. If no action is taken, the report predicts that antimicrobial resistance could lead to significant losses in livestock, threatening the food security of 2 billion people and causing up to $10 trillion in economic losses by 2050. The OIE is urging countries to invest in strengthening their national veterinary services, improving global and regional coordination, and enhancing animal disease monitoring systems. The development and use of advanced diagnostic tools that can distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals is also crucial for accurate monitoring and trade transparency.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 24, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://www.xinhuanet.com/20250524/c0cd7499c4304caf97a4c3c91650ded7/c.html)\n\n**UK Veterinary Medicine Market Trends Analysis and Growth Forecasts Report 2025-2030: Pet and Livestock Health Initiatives, Preventive Care and Vaccinations Spur Surge in Demand**\nThe UK Veterinary Medicine Market is expected to grow from USD 2.64 Billion in 2024 to USD 4.08 Billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 7.80%. This growth can be attributed to increasing pet ownership, government initiatives, and a rise in livestock population. According to the UK Pet Food 2024 stats, the pet dog population is estimated to be around 13.5 million, and the pet cat population is estimated to be around 12.5 million. As pet owners become more aware of the long-term health implications and necessary care for their pets, the demand for veterinary medicine in the country is further anticipated to increase. The Animal Health and Welfare Pathway, launched in 2023, aims to enhance farm animal health and welfare in the UK through collaboration among farmers, veterinarians, and the industry. This initiative is part of the Agricultural Transition Plan, focusing on improving biosecurity, tackling antimicrobial resistance, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. The pathway also aims to stimulate market demand for higher welfare products by improving transparency and ensuring fair pricing for farmers. Furthermore, zoonotic diseases, which can be transmitted from animals to humans, have gained significant attention due to their potential impact on public health, driving pet owners and livestock farmers to seek preventive care and vaccinations for their animals, thereby boosting the demand for veterinary medication.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 08:03 AM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/22/3086342/28124/en/UK-Veterinary-Medicine-Market-Trends-Analysis-and-Growth-Forecasts-Report-2025-2030-Pet-and-Livestock-Health-Initiatives-Preventive-Care-and-Vaccinations-Spur-Surge-in-Demand.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts agree that the long-term trend for medically important antimicrobial drug sales in US livestock is flat or declining, with sales steadily decreasing since the mid-2010s and a 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023. The default (status quo) expectation is for sales to remain stable or decrease slightly in 2024. The main factors decreasing the probability of a \u22650.5% increase are strong and persistent regulatory and stewardship pressures, a shift to non-antibiotic disease prevention (e.g., vaccines, diagnostics, biosecurity), stable or only modestly growing US livestock production, and continued industry and consumer demand for reduced antibiotic use. \n\nThe only factors increasing the probability of an uptick are the possibility of significant disease outbreaks (with 2024 noted for a surge in avian influenza and other global animal disease reports) and, less significantly, minor production recovery or market artifacts. However, most experts highlight that disease outbreaks in the US have not resulted in large, sustained national increases in antibiotic use in recent years and are often managed through culling or non-antibiotic measures. Additionally, US veterinary pharmaceutical market growth is generally in non-antibiotic categories (such as vaccines, diagnostics, or companion animals) and does not directly signal increased antimicrobial use in food animals. \n\nNo expert identifies evidence of major regulatory rollback or sharp policy change that could drive sales higher in 2024. Small, one-off increases from reporting quirks or moderate outbreaks are possible, but historical precedent and policy inertia still make these events unlikely.\n\nFinal forecast probabilities across experts range from 8% to 32%, with most clustered around 11-18%. The highest estimate (32%) comes from weighing the possible impact of notable disease outbreaks in certain sectors, but this remains a minority view. The central consensus is that the probability of a \u22650.5% increase in 2024 is firmly below 25%, with base rates and policy momentum heavily favoring a 'No' outcome.",
