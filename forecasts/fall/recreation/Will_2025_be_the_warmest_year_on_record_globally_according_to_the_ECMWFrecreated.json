Third, while marine heatwaves and ocean heat content are extremely high and may buffer some cooling, the breaking of the >1.5\u00b0C streak in May and the 'brief respite' language from C3S suggest that the anomaly is receding.

In summer\u202f2025 the North Sea\u2019s mean surface temperature reached 15.7\u202f\u00b0C, about 3\u202f\u00b0C above the long\u2011term average, and the BSH recorded a 55\u2011day marine heatwave at the Kiel lighthouse station \u2013 the longest since measurements began in 1969.  The Mediterranean averaged 26.9\u202f\u00b0C in July\u202f2025, the highest on record, and the Copernicus Marine Service noted that 65\u202f% of the basin\u2019s surface was affected by the strongest heatwave ever observed in July.  A meta\u2011analysis by Geomar\u2011Helmholtz\u2011Kiel found that a warming of only a few tenths of a degree can push seagrass beds, fish stocks and coastal habitats into high\u2011risk zones.  The article cites a 0.8\u202f\u00b0C additional warming scenario that could reduce fish stocks by 30\u201340\u202f%, threatening fisheries in Italy, Greece and Spain.  It also warns that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may weaken enough to reach a tipping point within two decades, with potential costs of several trillion euros by 2100, according to the Max\u2011Planck\u2011Gesellschaft.  Arctic sea\u2011ice volume has dropped by roughly 75\u202f% since the 1980s, and the recent winter showed an unusually low ice extent, signalling a rapid system shift.  The piece concludes that Europe must intensify marine\u2011heat\u2011wave early\u2011warning systems, adaptive fisheries management and nature\u2011based coastal protection, but stresses that without substantial emission cuts these measures will lag behind reality.  Key quotes include BSH\u2011referent Dagmar Kieke saying \u2018Wir sehen einen Zusammenhang mit einer ausgepr\u00e4gten marinen Hitzewelle vor Norwegen in diesem Sommer, die sich bis in die Nordsee hinein auswirkte\u2019 and Geomar scientist Abed El Rahman Hassoun warning \u2018Ohne deutlich mehr Erfolge beim Klimaschutz werden die Risiken so gro\u00df, dass sich die \u00d6kosysteme kaum anpassen k\u00f6nnen \u2013 jedes Zehntelgrad weniger z\u00e4hlt\u2019.

Using historical mortality data, they estimated about 24,400 excess deaths in those cities during that period. Comparing to a counterfactual world that was not 1.3\u202f\u00b0C warmer, they found that nearly 70\u202f% \u2013 16,500 deaths \u2013 were attributable to global warming, suggesting climate change could have tripled the number of heat deaths this summer. The study, conducted by scientists at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, echoes a 2023 Nature Medicine paper that reported more than 47,000 heat\u2011related deaths across Europe. Researchers noted that Rome had the highest estimated climate\u2011related deaths (835), followed by Athens (630) and Paris (409), and that over 85\u202f% of the excess deaths were among people aged 65 or older. 'It's impossible to get real\u2011time statistics right now,' said co\u2011author Friederike Otto, adding that the estimates are 'in the right ballpark.' 'What makes this finding even more alarming is that the methods used in these attribution studies are scientifically robust, yet conservative,' said atmospheric scientist Akshay Deoras, adding that the actual death toll could be higher. 'An increase in heatwave temperature of just 2\u20114\u202f\u00b0C can be the difference between life and death for thousands of people \u2013 this is why heatwaves are known as silent killers,' said co\u2011author Garyfallos Konstantinoudis.

The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summers of 2023, 2024 and 2025 were the hottest on record, according to the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and NOAA. The June\u2011to\u2011August period of 2025 was the third hottest on record, with a global average temperature 0.47\u202f\u00b0C above the 1991\u20112000 average (C3S) and 1.02\u202f\u00b0C hotter than the 20th\u2011century average (NOAA). The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ranked the latest summer as the third hottest in its 176\u2011year record. A new study by researchers at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found that climate change likely tripled the number of heat\u2011related deaths in European cities this summer. In 854 urban areas examined, 68\u202f% of the estimated 24,400 heat deaths were attributable to climate change, a figure that covers only about 30\u202f% of Europe\u2019s population (study). Friederike Otto, a co\u2011author, said, 'Many of these [people] would not have died without climate change.' The study also notes that the proportion of heat deaths attributable to climate change is creeping up. In the U.S., heat waves have increased from an average of two per summer in the 1960s to more than six today, with the heat\u2011wave season lengthening from about 20 days to over 70 days. A 2021 Science study projects that children born in 2020 will experience seven times as many heat waves over their lifetime as those born in 1960. The article cites the World Meteorological Organization\u2019s confirmation that global CO\u2082 levels reached a record 420\u202fppm in 2023, up from ~280\u202fppm pre\u2011industrial. It also notes that 2024 was the first year on record to have an average temperature more than 1.5\u202f\u00b0C above the pre\u2011industrial era, a milestone that does not yet breach the Paris Agreement threshold but signals the world is about 1.2\u20131.3\u202f\u00b0C above pre\u2011industrial levels. 'The specifics will vary wherever you're looking in the world, but the basic point of these studies will always be the same: that we are warming the world through our fossil fuel emissions and other activities and that this is causing people to die,' said Clair Barnes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 04:14 AM\nSource:[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-fuels-record-summer-heat-killing-thousands/)\n\n**Ozone Layer Hole: What the World Meteorological Organization Really Says**\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced in a September 16, 2025 communiqu\u00e9 that the ozone layer hole over Antarctica is expected to be fully restored by 2050. The WMO noted that in 2024 the hole\u2019s depth was below the 1990\u20112020 average, with a maximum ozone loss of 46.1\u202fmillion tonnes on September\u202f29, making it smaller than the larger holes recorded between 2020 and 2023. The report highlighted that the late\u2011spring appearance of the hole in 2024 is a strong signal of the beginning of ozone recovery. The WMO also projected that a complete recovery would prevent an additional global temperature rise of 0.3\u202f\u00b0C to 0.5\u202f\u00b0C by 2100.

It cites that seven of the ten most climate\u2011vulnerable nations worldwide are in Africa, and that over the past 60\u202fyears the continent has warmed faster than the global average, with the climate changing at rates unprecedented in at least 2,000\u202fyears \u2013 a claim quoted directly from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. The report notes that 35\u202f% of the world\u2019s deaths from extreme weather, climate or water stress over the last 50\u202fyears occurred in Africa, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It states that the average annual maximum temperature in northern and southern Africa is likely to be close to 4\u202f\u00b0C above normal. Africa\u2019s average annual surface temperature in 2024 was about 0.86\u202f\u00b0C above the 1991\u20112020 mean, with North Africa the fastest\u2011warming region at 1.28\u202f\u00b0C above that period. The report warns that under a business\u2011as\u2011usual scenario temperatures could rise 3\u20116\u202f\u00b0C by century\u2011end, with the greatest increases projected for the northern and southern parts of the continent and the fastest rate of change on the western side.

In summer\u202f2025 the North Sea\u2019s mean surface temperature reached 15.7\u202f\u00b0C, about 3\u202f\u00b0C above the long\u2011term average, and the BSH recorded a 55\u2011day marine heatwave at the Kiel lighthouse station \u2013 the longest since measurements began in 1969.  The Mediterranean averaged 26.9\u202f\u00b0C in July\u202f2025, the highest on record, and the Copernicus Marine Service noted that 65\u202f% of the basin\u2019s surface was affected by the strongest heatwave ever observed in July.  A meta\u2011analysis by Geomar\u2011Helmholtz\u2011Kiel found that a warming of only a few tenths of a degree can push seagrass beds, fish stocks and coastal habitats into high\u2011risk zones.  The article cites a 0.8\u202f\u00b0C additional warming scenario that could reduce fish stocks by 30\u201340\u202f%, threatening fisheries in Italy, Greece and Spain.  It also warns that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may weaken enough to reach a tipping point within two decades, with potential costs of several trillion euros by 2100, according to the Max\u2011Planck\u2011Gesellschaft.  Arctic sea\u2011ice volume has dropped by roughly 75\u202f% since the 1980s, and the recent winter showed an unusually low ice extent, signalling a rapid system shift.

Using historical mortality data, they estimated about 24,400 excess deaths in those cities during that period. Comparing to a counterfactual world that was not 1.3\u202f\u00b0C warmer, they found that nearly 70\u202f% \u2013 16,500 deaths \u2013 were attributable to global warming, suggesting climate change could have tripled the number of heat deaths this summer. The study, conducted by scientists at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, echoes a 2023 Nature Medicine paper that reported more than 47,000 heat\u2011related deaths across Europe. Researchers noted that Rome had the highest estimated climate\u2011related deaths (835), followed by Athens (630) and Paris (409), and that over 85\u202f% of the excess deaths were among people aged 65 or older. 'It's impossible to get real\u2011time statistics right now,' said co\u2011author Friederike Otto, adding that the estimates are 'in the right ballpark.' 'What makes this finding even more alarming is that the methods used in these attribution studies are scientifically robust, yet conservative,' said atmospheric scientist Akshay Deoras, adding that the actual death toll could be higher. 'An increase in heatwave temperature of just 2\u20114\u202f\u00b0C can be the difference between life and death for thousands of people \u2013 this is why heatwaves are known as silent killers,' said co\u2011author Garyfallos Konstantinoudis.

The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summers of 2023, 2024 and 2025 were the hottest on record, according to the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and NOAA. The June\u2011to\u2011August period of 2025 was the third hottest on record, with a global average temperature 0.47\u202f\u00b0C above the 1991\u20112000 average (C3S) and 1.02\u202f\u00b0C hotter than the 20th\u2011century average (NOAA). The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ranked the latest summer as the third hottest in its 176\u2011year record. A new study by researchers at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found that climate change likely tripled the number of heat\u2011related deaths in European cities this summer. In 854 urban areas examined, 68\u202f% of the estimated 24,400 heat deaths were attributable to climate change, a figure that covers only about 30\u202f% of Europe\u2019s population (study). Friederike Otto, a co\u2011author, said, 'Many of these [people] would not have died without climate change.' The study also notes that the proportion of heat deaths attributable to climate change is creeping up. In the U.S., heat waves have increased from an average of two per summer in the 1960s to more than six today, with the heat\u2011wave season lengthening from about 20 days to over 70 days. A 2021 Science study projects that children born in 2020 will experience seven times as many heat waves over their lifetime as those born in 1960. The article cites the World Meteorological Organization\u2019s confirmation that global CO\u2082 levels reached a record 420\u202fppm in 2023, up from ~280\u202fppm pre\u2011industrial. It also notes that 2024 was the first year on record to have an average temperature more than 1.5\u202f\u00b0C above the pre\u2011industrial era, a milestone that does not yet breach the Paris Agreement threshold but signals the world is about 1.2\u20131.3\u202f\u00b0C above pre\u2011industrial levels.

In 2024 the atmospheric CO\u2082 concentration reached a record 3.75\u202fppm, an 18,600\u202f% increase over the natural variability of 0.02\u202fppm per year, according to paleoclimate data.  The global mean temperature rose 0.3\u202f\u00b0C in 2023\u201124, bringing the planet into a full year of 1.5\u202f\u00b0C above pre\u2011industrial levels.  NASA GRACE/GRACE\u2011FO data show that terrestrial water storage (TWS) has declined since 2002, with drying areas expanding at twice the size of California each year, creating what the authors call \u2018mega\u2011drying regions\u2019 across the Northern Hemisphere.  Famiglietti et\u202fal.

Carlo Buontempo, Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, stated, 'May 2025 briefly interrupted the 1.5\u00b0C above trend seen in 21 out of the last 22 months, but the warming of the climate system will continue, and this threshold will be exceeded again soon.' The average surface temperature of 15.79\u00b0C is 0.53\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average and 1.4\u00b0C above the pre-industrial era average of 1850-1900. This temperature increase does not exceed the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, but it clearly shows that global warming continues. The past 10 years have been among the top 10 warmest years on record.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 08:25 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/dunya/2025-mayisi-tarihin-en-sicak-ikinci-mayisi-olacak-18735205-haberi/)\n\n**May was world's second-hottest on record, EU scientists say - The Weather Network**\nAccording to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), May 2025 was the world's second-warmest month on record, with global surface temperatures averaging 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than in the pre-industrial period. This breaks a 21-month streak of temperatures exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial times. Carlo Buontempo, C3S director, stated, 'Whilst this may offer a brief respite for the planet, we do expect the 1.5C threshold to be exceeded again in the near future due to the continued warming of the climate system.' The main cause of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, which contributed to last year being the planet's hottest on record.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 12, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[The Weather Network](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/en/news/climate/impacts/may-was-worlds-second-hottest-on-record-eu-scientists-say)\n\n**May 2025: A Brief Respite from Global Warming**\nMay 2025 was the second warmest month globally, with a temperature of 15.79\u00b0C, according to the European Copernicus observatory. The month was marked by unusually high sea surface temperatures, with 20.79\u00b0C, also the second highest on record. Experts note that 'large areas in the north-eastern North Atlantic, which experienced marine heatwaves, recorded record surface temperatures for the month.' The health of the oceans is a key focus of the third United Nations Conference on the Oceans (UNOC), currently taking place in Nice. The conference highlights the importance of containing the 1.5\u00b0C global warming target, as exceeding it would lead to more frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, and droughts. Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), notes that 'this brief respite may offer a brief respite for the planet, but we expect the 1.5\u00b0C threshold to be crossed again in the near future due to ongoing climate change.' The 12-month period from June 2024 to May 2025 saw a 1.57\u00b0C increase in global temperatures compared to the pre-industrial era.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[La-R%C3%A9publique-des-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es](https://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/societe/afp/en-mai-la-chaleur-est-restee-la-norme-sur-terre-comme-pour-les-mers-24814087.php)\n\n**2025 Sees Second-Hottest May on Record, Climate Change to Continue**\nAccording to the European climate change service 'Copernicus', this year has seen the second-hottest May on record, with climate change causing a heatwave that exceeded the record temperatures in Greenland. The Copernicus 'C3S' newsletter reported that last month was the second-hottest May on record globally, only surpassed by May 2024. In the period from March to May, the Northern Hemisphere recorded its second-highest average temperature for spring, reflecting the ongoing trend of rising global temperatures. The records show that the average global temperature last month was 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than the pre-industrial period between 1850 and 1900, which saw a significant expansion of fossil fuel burning for industrial purposes. Although May 2025 did not exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, as happened in 21 of the last 22 months, Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo confirmed that this 'temporary retreat' will not last, due to the continued global warming phenomenon, according to Reuters. Carlo Buontempo said, 'This may provide a brief respite for the planet, but we expect to exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold again in the near future due to the continued rise in global temperature.' Emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from fossil fuel burning are the main cause of climate change, and last year was the warmest on record globally. A study by the 'World Weather Attribution' group found that the recent heatwave in Iceland and Greenland was 3 degrees Celsius stronger due to climate change caused by human activities, leading to accelerated melting of Greenland's ice. Another study published by the organization found that 49% of the world's population lived through at least 30 additional days of extreme heat. The study defined 'extreme heat days' as those exceeding 90% of the highest recorded temperatures between 1991 and 2020. Copernicus' European records date back to 1940 and are regularly audited and compared to global climate records dating back to 1850, giving confidence in the alarming trends observed, according to experts.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 10:20 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/climate/2025/6/11/2025-%d9%8a%d8%b3%d8%ac%d9%84-%d8%ab%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a-%d8%a3%d9%83%d8%ab%d8%b1-%d8%b4%d9%87%d9%88%d8%b1-%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%8a%d9%88-%d8%ad%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a9-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89)\n\n**May 2025: The Second-Hottest May on Record, Global Warming Continues**\nAccording to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), May 2025 was the second-hottest May globally in recorded history, with an average surface temperature of 15.79\u00b0C, 0.53\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. This temperature increase did not exceed the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, but it clearly shows the continuation of global warming. The past 10 years have been the warmest 10 years on record. Carlo Buontempo, Director of C3S, said, 'May 2025 temporarily interrupted the 1.5\u00b0C above trend seen in 21 of the last 22 months, but the warming of the climate system will continue, and this threshold will be exceeded again soon.' The unusually dry spring in Europe, particularly in the northwest, has raised concerns about water scarcity and agricultural losses. C3S data shows that Turkey, Ukraine, southern Russia, and northern and central Europe experienced below-average rainfall in May 2025, with some areas recording the lowest soil moisture and rainfall levels since 1979. Similar drought conditions were observed in North America, the Horn of Africa, South Africa, South America, Central Asia, and southern Australia. The North Atlantic Ocean also set a record for the highest sea surface temperatures ever recorded in May.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:22 AM\nSource:[Haberler | Son Dakika Haberleri - Dirili\u015f Postas\u0131](https://www.dirilispostasi.com/kuraklik-alarmi-korkutan-rapor-aciklandi)\n\n**May 2025: A Brief Respite from Global Warming?**\nAccording to the Copernicus Observatory, the world experienced another hot May. The heat remained as the new norm on land and in the oceans, many of which are still experiencing 'unusually high' temperatures, as reported by the European Copernicus Observatory on Wednesday (June 11, 2025). Although it has returned below the 1.5\u00b0C threshold of warming compared to the pre-industrial era, last month was the second hottest May in history, just behind May 2024, explained the observatory. The month was marked by a mean temperature of 15.79\u00b0C, which is 0.12\u00b0C cooler than the record set last year but slightly warmer than May 2020, which ranks third. The same applies to the oceans: with a surface temperature of 20.79\u00b0C, the month was also the second warmest in recent history, just behind May 2024. However, these temperatures remained 'unusually high' in many seas or ocean basins, observes Copernicus. 'Large areas in the northeast of the North Atlantic, which have suffered heat waves, have recorded record-breaking surface temperatures for the month. Most of the Mediterranean Sea was much warmer than average,' say the experts. Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), notes that 'May 2025 interrupts a long sequence of unprecedented months above 1.5\u00b0C of warming.' This figure is a symbolic threshold agreed upon in the Paris Agreement on climate change. 'This may offer a brief respite for the planet, but it is expected that the 1.5\u00b0C threshold will be exceeded again in the near future due to the continued warming of the climate system,' he highlights.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[El Litoral](https://www.ellitoral.com/informacion-general/observatorio-copernicus-mundo-volvio-vivir-mayo-caluroso_0_odRMKC8QLv.html)\n\n**May 2025 was world's second-hottest on record, says EU climate agency**\nThe world experienced its second-warmest May on record, with a global surface temperature 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than in the pre-industrial period, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This break in extraordinary heat is unlikely to last, and scientists warn that the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold will be exceeded again in the near future. Carlo Buontempo, C3S director, said, 'Whilst this may offer a brief respite for the planet, we do expect the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold to be exceeded again in the near future due to the continued warming of the climate system.' A separate study found that human-caused climate change made a record-breaking heatwave in Iceland and Greenland about 3C hotter than it otherwise would have been, contributing to a huge additional melting of Greenland's ice sheet. Sarah Kew, study co-author, said, 'Even cold-climate countries are experiencing unprecedented temperatures.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 04:31 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/may-2025-was-world-s-second-hottest-on-record-says-eu-climate-agency-125061100248_1.html)\n\n**Earth Experiences 12 Consecutive Months of Record-Breaking Heat**\nThe Earth has experienced 12 consecutive months with record-breaking heat, a trend that began in June 2023 due to a new episode of El Ni\u00f1o. According to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the temperature in May was 0.65 degrees above the average between 1991 and 2020, marking 12 consecutive months of record-breaking heat. Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said, 'It's impacting, but not surprising, that we've reached this streak of 12 months. While this sequence of record months will eventually be interrupted, the general trend of climate change remains and there are no signs of a change in this trend.' Buontempo added, 'We're living in unprecedented times, but we also have an unprecedented ability to monitor the climate and this can help inform our actions. This series of warmer months will be remembered as relatively cool, but if we manage to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in the near future, we could return to these 'cool' temperatures by the end of the century.' The global average temperature in May was 1.52 degrees above the pre-industrial average of 1850-1900, marking the 11th consecutive month with at least 1.5 degrees of warming. Ann Harrison, climate policy advisor for Amnesty International, noted that 'recent floods in Brazil, Kenya, and Germany, and record-breaking heatwaves in India, other parts of South Asia, and Mexico highlight the imminent damage that will result from continued global warming unless serious and significant measures are taken.' According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), there is an 80% probability that the global average annual surface temperature will exceed pre-industrial levels by more than 1.5 degrees at least once in the next five years, exceeding the global warming limit set in the Paris Agreement.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2024 05:59 PM\nSource:[ondacero.es](https://www.ondacero.es/noticias/medio-ambiente/tierra-encadena-doce-meses-record-calor-oms-lanza-seria-advertencia_2024060566608b62f4db14000111ee98.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that 2025 will almost certainly be among the top three warmest years globally, according to the ECMWF, but is unlikely to surpass the record set in 2024. The primary reason cited is the fading of the strong El Ni\u00f1o that boosted global temperatures in 2023-2024, with 2025 trending into neutral or La Ni\u00f1a conditions\u2014historically associated with a slight global cooling. Although persistent marine heatwaves, extraordinarily high ocean heat content, and the steady rise of greenhouse gases (CO2, methane) are keeping global temperatures extremely high, interim data for 2025 (such as May being the second-hottest on record and the interruption of a long streak of >1.5\u00b0C anomalies) indicate that this year is tracking slightly below 2024. Multiple experts refer to authoritative sources (e.g., Copernicus, Berkeley Earth, Zeke Hausfather) stating that a new record in 2025 is 'very unlikely,' with the status quo, historical base rates, and observations all strongly favoring a No. However, most leave some non-negligible probability (ranging from 15% to 32%) for an upset due to exceptionally warm oceans or unforeseen climate system responses. Probabilities cluster tightly between 15% and 32%, with most between 15\u201325%. In summary, the consensus is that the probability of 2025 being the warmest year on record is low due to ENSO cooling, data so far, and historical precedent, though oceanic anomalies and the relentless warming trend keep the chance above zero.",
