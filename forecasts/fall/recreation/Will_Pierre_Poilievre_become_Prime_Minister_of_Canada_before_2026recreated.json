No new evidence or argument surfaced to warrant an increase in probability. The base rate, institutional inertia, and news context all continue to support a probability of 1%.",

Analysts estimate the deficit could approach $100\u202fbillion, and Carney acknowledged that $40\u202fbillion of additional spending had already been announced six months into the fiscal year. Poilievre warned that deficits drive up inflation, grocery prices, housing costs and interest rates, and that the government\u2019s fiscal anchors\u2014capping the annual deficit at 1\u202f% of GDP and maintaining a declining debt\u2011to\u2011GDP ratio\u2014are under scrutiny.

Poilievre said, 'When I left, there was a Liberal prime minister who was making excuses about breaking promises, running massive deficits. Costs, crime, chaos were all out of control,' and repeated the criticism when Carney replied, 'I understand the leader of the opposition was busy,' referring to Poilievre\u2019s loss of a seat and missed tax cuts. Conservative MPs shouted across the aisle. Government House Leader Steven MacKinnon admitted he had \u2018no illusion\u2019 about cooperation but warned Poilievre could choose to work with Liberals. Poilievre promised his MPs would work with any party, yet attacked Carney\u2019s record, saying, 'That is not what Canadians voted for. What we are getting from Mark Carney is the same Liberal bait\u2011and\u2011switch.' MacKinnon outlined the Liberal agenda: an austerity budget with a \u2018substantial\u2019 deficit, a controversial border\u2011security bill, and a willingness to listen to \u2018constructive criticism\u2019 and \u2018responsible alternative policies.\u2019 The Liberals and Conservatives had previously cooperated on major\u2011projects legislation, but remain divided on criminal\u2011justice matters; Conservative justice critic Larry Brock called for stricter bail, while Justice Minister Sean Fraser promised bills on hate crimes and violence. The Liberals hold 169 of the 343 seats in the House, needing only three more votes to pass legislation. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves\u2011Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet suggested MacKinnon might need to explain contradictory statements, and NDP MP Alexandre Boulerice said his caucus is ready to collaborate if results are delivered.

Costs, crime, chaos were all out of control,' and repeated the criticism when Carney replied, 'I understand the leader of the opposition was busy,' referring to Poilievre\u2019s loss of a seat and missed tax cuts. Conservative MPs shouted across the aisle. Government House Leader Steven MacKinnon admitted he had \u2018no illusion\u2019 about cooperation but warned Poilievre could choose to work with Liberals. Poilievre promised his MPs would work with any party, yet attacked Carney\u2019s record, saying, 'That is not what Canadians voted for. What we are getting from Mark Carney is the same Liberal bait\u2011and\u2011switch.' MacKinnon outlined the Liberal agenda: an austerity budget with a \u2018substantial\u2019 deficit, a controversial border\u2011security bill, and a willingness to listen to \u2018constructive criticism\u2019 and \u2018responsible alternative policies.\u2019 The Liberals and Conservatives had previously cooperated on major\u2011projects legislation, but remain divided on criminal\u2011justice matters; Conservative justice critic Larry Brock called for stricter bail, while Justice Minister Sean Fraser promised bills on hate crimes and violence. The Liberals hold 169 of the 343 seats in the House, needing only three more votes to pass legislation. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves\u2011Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet suggested MacKinnon might need to explain contradictory statements, and NDP MP Alexandre Boulerice said his caucus is ready to collaborate if results are delivered. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May will focus on climate\u2011target accountability. The article, sourced from The Canadian Press, reports on these exchanges and the broader context of a minority government seeking opposition support.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 04:49 AM\nSource:[steinbachonline.com](https://steinbachonline.com/articles/liberals-conservatives-talk-co-operation-but-trade-jabs-as-parliament-returns-2)\n\n**What to watch, who\u2019s hot and who\u2019s not as Parliament returns**\nOn September 14, 2025, the 45th Canadian Parliament is set to convene. New Prime Minister Mark Carney and opposition leader Pierre Poilievre will stand two sword\u2011lengths apart on the Commons aisle, reflecting the narrow two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011percentage\u2011point margin that separated the Liberal and Conservative parties in the federal election. Poilievre, who led the Conservatives to 144 seats \u2013 the party\u2019s best popular\u2011vote share in more than three decades \u2013 must now demonstrate a convincing, confidence\u2011inspiring performance before the January vote of Conservative members tests his leadership. He has warned that 'things are getting worse' in Canada under Carney\u2019s leadership and that the Conservatives are ready to 'propose solutions' to the country\u2019s economic woes. Poilievre has also used the metaphors 'housing hell' and 'hell on earth' to criticize Liberal policies, and his favourite refrain is 'Hell, hell, hell.' Yves\u2011Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, has pledged to advance separatism and oppose Carney\u2019s 'centralising' agenda, while Don Davies, interim leader of the New Democrats, will likely support Carney on some measures but remains wary of aligning too closely with the Liberals. The article frames the return of Parliament as a busy fall, noting the internal critics of Poilievre and the challenges facing each party.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 06:10 PM\nSource:[thestar.com](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/what-to-watch-whos-hot-and-whos-not-as-mps-return-to-parliament/article_65dcefa4-ded0-4ef2-afa3-1d299d82e515.html)\n\n**What to watch, who's hot and who's not as MPs return to Parliament**\nThe article, published by The Star on September\u202f14\u202f2025, examines the political landscape as the 45th Canadian Parliament convenes. It notes that Prime Minister Mark\u202fCarney and Opposition Leader Pierre\u202fPoilievre will sit two sword\u2011lengths apart in the House of Commons, reflecting the narrow two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011percentage\u2011point margin between the Liberals and Conservatives in the federal election. Carney faces a 169\u2011of\u2011172 vote majority requirement to pass key legislation, including the October federal budget, and must keep his cabinet and backbenchers aligned amid criticism over his handling of trade threats and climate policy. Poilievre, who has regained the Official Opposition leadership, is expected to balance attack rhetoric with proposals to address economic woes, ahead of a January leadership vote. The piece also discusses potential allies: the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, led by Yves\u2011Fran\u00e7ois\u202fBlanchet, may oppose Carney\u2019s centralising agenda; the New Democratic Party, under interim leader Don\u202fDavies, could support selective measures while distancing itself from the Liberals. Committees and caucus dynamics are highlighted, noting the Green Party\u2019s single MP and the NDP\u2019s lack of official status. Hot topics include Quebec sovereignty, the oil\u2011gas sector, unemployment (7.1\u202f%), inflation, housing affordability, and immigration. The article quotes Carney\u2019s advisers, former leaders, and political commentators, and uses metaphors such as \u201cPolitics is like hockey\u201d to illustrate his style. Overall, the piece offers an analytical overview of the challenges and opportunities facing both Carney and Poilievre as they navigate parliamentary politics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 11:08 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/what-to-watch-whos-hot-and-whos-not-as-mps-return-to-parliament/article_65dcefa4-ded0-4ef2-afa3-1d299d82e515.html)\n\n**Pierre Poilievre's Hardest Test Yet: His Own Party | The Walrus**\nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre is set to return to the House of Commons after winning the August\u202f18 Battle River\u202f\u2013\u202fCrowfoot by\u2011election with a little over 80\u202f% of the vote, matching past Conservative results in the riding.  The by\u2011election is described as the first and easiest step on Poilievre\u2019s road to political recovery, following his defeat in the 2025 general election and loss of his Carleton seat.  According to the Conservative Party constitution, a leader defeated in a general election must face a confidence vote at the next national convention in January\u202f2026, which will be held in Calgary.\n\nThe Angus Reid Institute (ARI) released post\u2011election polling that shows a significant portion of Canadians, including Conservatives, view Poilievre as too similar to U.S. President Donald Trump.  The survey found 59\u202f% of respondents agreed with the statement \u2018Pierre Poilievre sounded too much like Donald Trump\u2019 during the 2025 campaign, versus 35\u202f% who disagreed.  Regionally, majorities in Quebec (64\u202f%), Atlantic Canada (63\u202f%), Ontario (60\u202f%) and British Columbia (58\u202f%) agreed, and even in Alberta and Saskatchewan the agreement and disagreement rates were similar.\n\nAmong all voters, 55\u202f% of men and 64\u202f% of women agreed with the Trump comparison, and 19\u202f% of Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) voters held the same view, representing one in five Conservatives.  Additional dissatisfaction was noted: 29\u202f% of Conservatives said the campaign slogan \u2018Bring it Home\u2019 made no sense, and 27\u202f% felt the campaign was too negative.\n\nARI\u2019s final question asked whether Poilievre should remain leader or be replaced.  Overall, 64\u202f% of respondents favored Poilievre staying on, while 22\u202f% wanted him voted out, a nearly 3\u2011to\u20111 ratio in his favour.  The majority of respondents across all provinces, age groups, and genders supported his continued leadership.\n\nThese numbers suggest that while Poilievre retains a majority of support among Canadians and Conservatives, a notable minority\u2014especially within his own party\u2014expresses criticism that could surface at the upcoming convention.\n\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[The Walrus](https://thewalrus.ca/pierre-poilievres-hardest-test-yet-his-own-party/)\n\n**Pierre Poilievre Wins By-Election, Returns to Ottawa as Conservative MP**\nPierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, won the by-election on Monday with over 80% of the vote. He will return to Ottawa as a Member of Parliament for the Ontario Conservative Party. Poilievre said, 'It's an honor to meet the people of this region.' He spent several weeks in the new riding meeting with voters, attending events, and visiting local businesses. 'In fact, the whole process has been very effective,' he said. Poilievre's campaign focused on door-to-door canvassing and community events, a strategy he used in his first election in 2004. He will return to the House of Commons on September 15 and will face off against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Poilievre has promised to introduce a bill called the 'Canada Sovereignty Act' and has pledged to support the construction of several major infrastructure projects, including pipelines and a highway. The Conservative Party will hold its national convention in Calgary in January 2026, where Poilievre's leadership will be reviewed and a secret ballot will be held to determine his fate as party leader.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 19, 2025 03:04 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/8/19/n14576896.htm)\n\n**Pierre Poilievre's Return to the Commons: A New Challenge**\nPierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, will return to the House of Commons in mid-September after winning the by-election in the Battle River-Crowfoot riding in Alberta. This return to the Commons will allow him to question Prime Minister Mark Carney as soon as the parliamentary session resumes. Poilievre has mastered the art of parliamentary jousting, as he has demonstrated during Justin Trudeau's tenure. However, his return to the Commons does not mean that his ordeal is over, as he will now face even more daunting challenges in the next five months. He will have to convince Canadians that he is the best leader to lead the country, while also convincing his own party members that he is the right person to lead them into the next election. The Conservative Party's support has been declining in recent months, and Poilievre will have to work hard to regain the ground lost to the Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney. The Liberal Party has been adopting some of the Conservative Party's policies, making it harder for Poilievre to differentiate himself. Poilievre will have to convince Canadians that he is the best option, while also facing a vote of confidence from his own party members in January 2026.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 19, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[La Presse.ca](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/analyses/2025-08-19/pierre-poilievre-de-retour-aux-communes/la-fin-d-un-supplice-le-debut-d-un-autre.php)\n\n**Federal By-election to be Held in Alberta, Allowing Pierre Poilievre to Return to Parliament**\nCanadian Prime Minister Trudeau is expected to announce on Monday (June 30) that a by-election will be held in the Battle River -- Crowfoot riding in Alberta to allow Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre to return to Parliament by winning a seat in the riding. According to a report by the National Post, a source close to Trudeau revealed that voters will choose a new MP on August 11 or 18. The source, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that Trudeau will fulfill his promise to quickly announce the by-election results and avoid 'political games' so that the by-election can be completed before the House of Commons reconvenes in mid-September, rather than being delayed until December or January. The source added that the election will be held on August 11 or 18, as the first Monday in August is Alberta Heritage Day and it is a principle not to disturb that day. Pierre Poilievre lost his seat in the Carleton riding in Ottawa in the federal election on April 28 and therefore cannot enter Parliament to ask questions. Conservative MP Damien Kurek in the Battle River -- Crowfoot riding resigned in early June, paving the way for his party leader to participate in the by-election.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 29, 2025 08:44 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/6/29/n14541487.htm)\n\n**Poilievre says he's confident he'll get to stay as Conservative leader - National | Globalnews.ca**\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre expressed confidence that he will remain in his role despite losing his seat in the 2025 federal election. When asked about a potential leadership challenge, Poilievre replied, 'no.' He attributed the party's gains, including 2.4 million more votes and 25 more seats, to the party's success rather than his own loss. Poilievre stated, 'We got 2.4 million more votes, 25 more seats. We had the biggest vote count in our party's history. The biggest increase in our party's history. The biggest vote share since 1988.' Conservative MP Damien Kurek resigned his seat to allow Poilievre to run in a byelection, stating, 'My belief remains today that Pierre Poilievre is the right man to be prime minister of Canada.' Prime Minister Mark Carney promised to ensure the byelection process is expedited, saying, 'I will ensure that it happens as soon as possible. No games. Nothing.

He expressed his love for the House of Commons and his desire to return, saying, 'I love the House of Commons, I love the excitement and the thrill.' Poilievre plans to run in a byelection in a rural Alberta riding later this summer. In the meantime, Andrew Scheer, the Opposition leader, led the Conservatives during Prime Minister Mark Carney's first question period. Scheer promised to scrutinize Carney's words and actions, while Poilievre suggested that the Conservatives are ready to work with the minority Liberal government. He stated, 'We will vote for every tax cut, always and everywhere. We love taxpayers.' The Conservatives will try to amend the government's ways and means motion to increase the tax cut and end the industrial carbon price.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[ca.news.yahoo.com](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/poilievre-finds-himself-spectator-debate-190110970.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is overwhelming consensus that Pierre Poilievre will not become Prime Minister of Canada before 2026. The experts unanimously cite the very recent federal election (April 2025) which resulted in a Liberal minority government under Mark Carney, and note that minority governments in Canada\u2014especially those just a few seats shy of a majority\u2014historically persist for at least a year post-election unless destabilized by major scandal or crisis. The Liberals have effectively managed ad hoc support from smaller parties, and there are no news reports or signals of an imminent non-confidence vote, major scandal, or coordinated opposition maneuvering that could swiftly topple the government.\n\nPoilievre\u2019s position is further weakened by his loss of his own seat in the general election (though he returned via by-election) and his upcoming mandatory leadership review in January 2026, with some internal party criticism and doubts about his staying power. Even in the theoretical case of a sudden government fall\u2014through a failed budget or mass defections\u2014the calendar makes it extremely unlikely that a snap election, campaign, and government transition could all occur before the January 1, 2026 deadline. The logistical, parliamentary, historical, and procedural barriers to Poilievre\u2019s rapid ascension are judged as nearly insurmountable within the short remaining time window.\n\nAll base rates and comparable historical precedents point to the likelihood of a mid-term or immediate post-election change in Prime Minister being extremely low\u2014often described as well below 1% or 'vanishingly small.' The only remotely plausible 'yes' scenarios involve highly improbable shocks, such as an unprecedented government collapse, coalition realignment, or mass elite defection, none of which current news or parliamentary dynamics support. Final probabilities offered by all experts cluster between 0% and 2%, with the most common figure being 1%. The summary judgment is that the outcome is overwhelmingly likely to be negative: Pierre Poilievre will not become Prime Minister of Canada before 2026.",
