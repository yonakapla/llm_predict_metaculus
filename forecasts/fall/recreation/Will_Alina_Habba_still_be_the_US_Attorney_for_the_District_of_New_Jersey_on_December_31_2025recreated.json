However, the Trump administration has shown both creativity and a willingness to exploit ambiguities and slowdowns in the law, and the appeals process can take months, especially if the Supreme Court becomes involved. The question resolves on December 31, 2025, which is not immediate but is soon enough that the appeals could plausibly still be pending or at least unresolved at that date. With the DOJ and White House committed to keeping Habba in, Senate obstruction of alternatives, and a history of slow-moving judicial processes, there is a real chance she could remain on the website as acting U.S. Attorney through year-end. Still, the mounting pressure from the judiciary, operational dysfunction, and the clear legal finding against her appointment make it unlikely this status quo can persist for long. Weighing these factors, I judge that Habba remaining as U.S. Attorney on December 31, 2025 is improbable but not impossible\u2014much depends on the speed and aggressiveness of judicial enforcement and the administration\u2019s willingness to defy or slow-walk compliance.

The base rate for similar high-profile, statutorily defective appointments is that the official is eventually removed, especially when judicial orders and operational paralysis are involved. While the administration could conceivably delay compliance through further legal challenges or maneuvers, the mounting pressure from stymied prosecutions and the clear will of the district judiciary makes it unlikely that Habba will still be recognized as U.S. Attorney at the end of 2025. The only plausible 'yes' path is an appellate win for the DOJ or extended stays, but neither is more probable than not. Accordingly, the probability that Habba remains in office on December 31, 2025 is low but not zero, as the administration's resolve and ongoing appeals could allow temporary continuance.",

Historically, unlawful appointees do not survive long once courts have ruled; even the most aggressive executive maneuvering rarely extends beyond a few months. The question\u2019s reliance on the office\u2019s website as an arbiter further tilts the odds, because if the judiciary prevails (as is overwhelmingly likely after a clear appellate ruling), the website will reflect the lawful officeholder.

The status quo is already a crisis state (frozen prosecutions), which is institutionally unsustainable. The principal-agent dynamic here strongly favors institutional checks over executive will.

Nearly all forecasters\u2014across law, public administration, and political science\u2014converge around a 10-20% probability, and critiques of higher forecasts (notably Elite Theory's 30%) persuasively highlight the overwhelming legal and institutional constraints. Defenses of 10-18% forecasts emphasize the rarity of unlawful appointees lasting months after judicial invalidation, especially with operational paralysis and judicial unity. No new evidence or reasoning justifies a significant shift. If anything, the consensus and strength of the group\u2019s arguments support my initial estimate or could justify an even lower number. However, out of continued deference to the slim possibility of executive delay or a surprise appellate outcome, I will maintain my original 10% forecast.",

The key points reiterated in group deliberation are: (1) the judiciary\u2019s unique power and motivation to enforce its ruling; (2) the operational and institutional unsustainability of ongoing legal paralysis; (3) the extremely low base rate for unlawful appointees surviving post-judicial rebuke, and (4) the lack of plausible paths for indefinite delay, given the expedited appellate timeline. The only meaningful uncertainty stems from the administration\u2019s willingness to push boundaries and the potential for a last-minute stay or Supreme Court intervention, but even these are unlikely to extend through year-end. The deliberation reinforced that my earlier probability was well-calibrated, perhaps even slightly high. To reflect the overwhelming consensus and the base rate, I am revising down slightly.",

        "description": "[Alina Habba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alina_Habba) is a New Jersey lawyer who first came to prominence as a lawyer for then-former President Donald Trump in [2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-lawsuit-new-york-times-alina-habba/2021/09/22/8acaf1c2-1bce-11ec-a99a-5fea2b2da34b_story.html). On March 24, 2025, after Trump retook the presidency, he [nominated Habba](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/trump-alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney.html) to serve as the Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, replacing John Giordano, who had previously been named the Interim U.S. Attorney on March 3, 2025.\n\nUnder [federal law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/546), Interim U.S. Attorneys may serve for only 120 days, unless they are confirmed as the U.S. Attorney by the Senate. Once the 120-day period expires, it falls to the local federal district court to appoint someone to the office. In Habba's case, the Senate did not vote on her nomination, and, on July 22, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey [announced](https://www.njd.uscourts.gov/sites/njd/files/StandingOrder2025-03USAttyAppointment.pdf) that, upon the expiration of her term, Habba would be replaced by [Desiree Leigh Grace](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/nyregion/desiree-grace-new-jersey-us-attorney.html), a longtime prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nGrace's tenure would be short-lived. Within days of the court's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that [Grace had been fired](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-attorney-new-jersey-alina-habba-desiree-leigh-grace-pam-bondi/) and Habba re-installed, now as the Acting U.S. Attorney. At this time, President Trump also withdrew Habba's nomination to serve as the U.S. Attorney, so that she would be [statutorily eligible](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3345) to serve in the \"acting\" role.\n\nFederal criminal defendants in New Jersey soon got wise to the situation and began filing motions to dismiss the charges against them, on the basis that Habba's appointment was unlawful. And on August 21, 2025, a federal judge [ruled](https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Brann-Habba-opinion.pdf) that indeed Habba's appointment was unlawful. The government quickly appealed, and an [expedited briefing schedule](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818.10.2.pdf) was set, under which the appeal should be fully briefed by October 14, 2025. But in the meantime, federal criminal trials and hearings in New Jersey are at a [standstill](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/nyregion/new-jersey-federal-court-slowdown.html), raising questions about how long the status quo can endure.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39756,\"question_id\":39152}}`",

In March 2025 she took on the case of Do\u011fukan G\u00fcnayd\u0131n, a Turkish national who had been arrested by ICE after a 2023 DWI conviction. Although G\u00fcnayd\u0131n had paid a fine and completed probation, ICE detained him and began deportation proceedings. Brown noted, 'There are not a lot of immigration attorneys in Minnesota who represent folks who are in jail,' and she spent a day at the Sherburne County Jail to offer help. She secured a dismissal of the deportation case in immigration court, but ICE refused to release him. Brown then filed a habeas corpus petition with a federal judge. Fifty\u2011six days after his arrest, on May 22, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey M. Bryan signed an order stating that G\u00fcnayd\u0131n\u2019s detention violated his due\u2011process rights, leading to his release. G\u00fcnayd\u0131n publicly thanked Brown and partner Kelsey Hines of Hines Immigration Law. Brown anticipates more cases under the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive ICE detention policy. She also has extensive plaintiff\u2011side civil\u2011litigation experience but prioritizes immigration work, saying, 'It's a tough area for young lawyers to get into because it's not a moneymaker,' and adding, 'But we need a strong bar. We need a lot of people who are willing to fight.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 10:52 AM\nSource:[Minnesota Lawyer](https://minnlawyer.com/2025/09/15/2025-up-coming-hannah-brown-hb-law-and-advocacy/)\n\n**'Sit this one out': Alina Habba's 'revealing' social media post gets skewered online**\nAlina Habba, the Trump administration's acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, posted on X that 'Flags were ordered to be lowered by the President of the United States. Lower. Your. Flags.' The post followed President Donald Trump's order to lower flags to half\u2011staff after the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Trump\u2019s order applies only to federal properties, but some conservatives urged private citizens to comply. Political analysts and commentators responded sharply. For example, Wu\u202fTang\u202fis\u202ffor\u202fthe\u202fChildren wrote, 'Remember when Trump made them raise flags for his inauguration despite half\u2011staff order for Jimmy Carter's death\u2026Habba should sit this one out!' Retired naval officer Dave\u202fPetri said, 'I don't know what is more revealing about this post: that a US Attorney would imply that the President can order private citizens and businesses to comply with his directed speech in violation of the 1st Amendment...' Journalist Matt\u202fJohnson recalled, 'Hey, remember when Trump had to be shamed into lowering flags for John McCain?' Retired imagery scientist Gary\u202fFuller noted, 'The Flag Code is advisory, not mandatory\u2026the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that the government cannot compel private citizens to display or treat the flag in a certain way, since that would violate the First Amendment.' History professor William\u202fTurner added, 'If you are an agency of the federal government. Everyone else is free to choose.' The article, published September\u202f14\u202f2025 by Raw Story, reports that the post was widely skewered online.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 08:32 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/alina-habba-2673993269/)\n\n**Border apprehensions are low, but prosecutions of undocumented immigrants in San Diego are way up**\nThe article reports that after President Donald Trump returned to office in January 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) directed federal prosecutors to aggressively charge immigration\u2011related offenses.  According to a memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi, the DOJ would \"use all available criminal statutes to combat the flood of illegal immigration that took place over the last four years.\"  The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of California (SDCA) claims that this guidance has \"secured the border,\" citing a \"remarkable achievement\" in reducing border apprehensions to historic lows while increasing criminal prosecutions.\n\nCBP data show that between October\u202f2023 and May\u202f2024, Border Patrol agents apprehended an average of more than 33,000 single adults per month, peaking at 37,898 in April\u202f2024.  In contrast, the SDCA filed 100 felony re\u2011entry cases and 27 misdemeanor illegal\u2011entry cases in December\u202f2023 (Biden\u2019s last full month), rising to 331 felony re\u2011entry and 155 misdemeanor cases by May\u202f2024 under Trump\u2011appointed leadership.  This represents a 353\u202f% increase in illegal\u2011reentry filings while apprehensions fell by 92.6\u202f% from the same month the previous year.\n\nThe article notes that the proportion of border\u2011apprehended individuals charged criminally is now higher than during Trump\u2019s first term, despite lower overall apprehensions.  Quotes from David\u202fBier of the Cato Institute and Tom\u202fWong of UC San Diego highlight that while prosecutions may deter some, many desperate migrants will still attempt entry.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s directives began with a memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil\u202fBove on Jan.\u202f21, 2025, ordering prosecutors to \"charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offenses\".  A follow\u2011up memo from Bondi on Feb.\u202f5 reinforced these instructions.\n\nOverall, the piece presents a factual overview of the shift in immigration enforcement, citing specific metrics and official statements without overt editorializing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[San Diego Union-Tribune](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/14/border-apprehensions-are-low-but-prosecutions-of-undocumented-immigrants-in-san-diego-are-way-up/)\n\n**Who is Lisa Cook? Meet the Fed governor Trump said he fired but is refusing to leave**\nFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to sit on the Fed Board, is in the middle of a legal showdown with former President Donald Trump, who has tried to fire her.  Trump\u2019s attempt was blocked by a federal judge, and he has asked an appeals court to allow the firing to take effect before the Fed\u2019s policy meeting on Tuesday.  Cook was nominated by President Joe Biden in 2022 and confirmed by a 51\u201147 Senate vote after Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie\u2011breaking vote.  She was re\u2011nominated for a full term in May 2023 and reconfirmed by a 51\u201147 vote.  Trump cited alleged mortgage\u2011fraud allegations from a letter by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte as grounds for removal.  Cook\u2019s attorneys denied the allegations and argued that the \u2018for\u2011cause\u2019 provision only covers conduct in office.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb granted a temporary block of the firing, allowing Cook to continue serving at the Fed.  The case is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Cook\u2019s background includes a Ph.D. in economics from UC\u202fBerkeley, a Marshall Scholarship from Spelman College, and a BA from Oxford.  She has said, 'I still have scars from that -- scar where hair won't grow in my eyebrow and a scar on my leg from having been beaten during that period, during the period of desegregation,' reflecting her experience as a Black student during integration.  Senator Pat Toomey called her 'grossly unqualified', while Senator Sherrod Brown said she was 'extremely qualified.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 11:07 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-governor)\n\n**Pam Bondi: The Woman Chosen by Trump to Advance His Conservative Agenda**\nPam Bondi, the former Florida Attorney General who served two consecutive terms until 2019, has become a central figure in Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.  According to the article, Bondi first rose to national prominence in 2011 when she was elected Florida\u2019s first woman attorney general, a state that at the time was the \"capital of the opioid pill factories\" with 98 of the 100 top oxycodone prescribers located there.  She later led a strict legislative effort that shut down those 98 doctors and clinics.  Bondi\u2019s loyalty to Trump was evident during the 2016 campaign, and in February\u202f2025 the Republican\u2011controlled Senate confirmed her as the U.S. Attorney General.  She promised an \"independent\" Department of Justice, but her first actions\u2014such as dismantling internal structures, reversing policies, and aligning the DOJ with Trump\u2019s wishes\u2014were described as the \"most convulsive transition in DOJ history since Watergate\".\n\nThe article cites several high\u2011profile women in Trump\u2019s orbit, including Ivanka Trump, Kellyanne Conway, and Megyn Kelly, to illustrate how Trump\u2019s circle has historically \"domesticated and recycled\" strong women.  It quotes Susie Wiles, a long\u2011time Republican strategist, who said Bondi is \"blonde and beautiful, but has steel nerves and has faced devastating situations with grace.\"  Mark Cuban is quoted as saying, \"Donald Trump never surrounds himself with strong, intelligent women.  He is intimidated by them.  He does not like them to challenge him,\" a claim the article counters by listing Bondi\u2019s actions.\n\nBondi\u2019s tenure has been marked by a series of conservative measures: she defended Trump\u2019s hard\u2011line immigration policies, limited asylum for women fleeing domestic violence, and pursued aggressive actions against transgender healthcare.  In April\u202f2025 her DOJ issued memoranda labeling certain gender\u2011affirming treatments for minors as \"genital mutilation\" and sued states that allowed trans athletes to compete according to their gender identity.  She also appointed Alina Habba, a former Trump personal lawyer, as federal prosecutor in New Jersey.\n\nThe article details Bondi\u2019s involvement in the Epstein case, noting her promise of a \"list of many names and flight records\" and her organization of a White House event titled \"Epstein Files: Phase\u202f1.\"  It criticizes her handling of the case, including her justification of a missing minute in the security footage as a \"reset\" and her alleged use of the DOJ to pursue political retribution, such as reviving the Crossfire Hurricane investigation to target former Democrats.\n\nOverall, the piece portrays Bondi as a loyal executor of Trump\u2019s agenda, using her position to advance conservative policies and suppress dissent, while framing her actions as a threat to democratic institutions.\n\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 03:17 AM\nSource:[P\u00e1gina/12](https://www.pagina12.com.ar/857201-pam-bondi-quien-es-la-mujer-elegida-por-trump-para-llevar-a-)\n\n**Acting U.S. attorney 'is validly serving,' federal prosecutors say in response to challenge**\nFederal prosecutors responded on Wednesday to a challenge by Nevada public defenders over the appointment of acting U.S. attorney Sigal Chattah, asserting that Chattah 'is validly serving.' Even if Chattah had not been legitimately serving, prosecutors said she would be fully authorized, by delegation, to supervise criminal prosecutions in Nevada because the attorney general gave her the title 'special attorney,' according to a filing that lists Chattah and Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Flake. Chattah has been in office since April, first as interim U.S. attorney and then as acting from July, a day before her interim term would have expired. Nevada Democratic Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto oppose Chattah, who has said she was made acting U.S. attorney because the senators would not approve her nomination. Public defenders argue Chattah's term expired in July and she has been acting without 'force or effect,' seeking a court to appoint a proper interim U.S. attorney. Prosecutors counter that the court has no authority to do so, noting Chattah resigned as interim before the end of her 120\u2011day term. The challenge was filed in multiple criminal cases, asking courts to dismiss indictments or disqualify Chattah. The dispute follows a federal judge's August 21 ruling that Alina Habba, Chattah's counterpart in New Jersey, was serving unlawfully. In July, Chattah and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson publicly clashed over a child\u2011sex sting case involving an Israeli official; Wolfson said the bail was pre\u2011set, while Chattah posted on X that a 'liberal district attorney and state court judge in Nevada FAILED TO REQUIRE AN ALLEGED CHILD MOLESTER TO SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT.' Wolfson responded that Chattah had shown 'unfitness to serve' and was 'often confused and often irresponsible in her assertions.' A group of retired state and federal judges wrote a letter in late July urging the court not to appoint Chattah after her interim appointment expired, citing a 2021 text in which Chattah said Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, who is Black, 'should be hanging from a (expletive) crane.' Chattah has said the expression was 'tongue in cheek' and had no racial context.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 02:22 AM\nSource:[Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/acting-u-s-attorney-is-validly-serving-federal-prosecutors-say-in-response-to-challenge-3440933/)\n\n**Federal prosecutor nominee for northern Ohio wins Senate panel's OK but remains in doubt**\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed David Toepfer to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to advance his nomination, but the full Senate has not yet confirmed him. The vote was part of a broader pattern of delays by Senate Democrats on Trump\u2011appointed U.S. attorney nominees, a practice that mirrors former Senator JD Vance\u2019s earlier block of Biden nominees. The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Dick Durbin, cited Vance\u2019s obstruction and the precedent set by Senator Tom Cotton. Republican Senator Charles Grassley criticized Democrats, calling the delays \u2018unprecedented\u2019 and arguing that they harm public safety. Durbin countered, noting that Republicans had broken the precedent during Trump\u2019s first term and that 68 of Biden\u2019s 93 nominees had been approved before the GOP blockade. Toepfer, a career prosecutor with 25 years of experience, will lead the Cleveland office for at least 120 days, after which the district\u2019s 18 federal judges can extend his term. If not confirmed, the office would face its longest vacancy in 170 years. The last confirmed U.S. attorney, Justin Herdman, left in January 2021, and the previous nominee, Marisa Darden, resigned before assuming the role.  \u2018It is the honor of a lifetime to serve the people of northern Ohio in this role,\u2019 said Toepfer.  \u2018The obstruction of U.S. Attorneys hurts our public safety,\u2019 said Grassley.  \u2018There is a conversation underway to try to find a bipartisan way out of this mess,\u2019 said Durbin.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[Cleveland](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/09/federal-prosecutor-nominee-for-northern-ohio-wins-senate-panels-ok-but-remains-in-doubt.html)\n\n**US Atty Habba Seeks To Nix NJ Mayor's False Arrest Suit**\nNew Jersey's acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba told a federal judge that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka's lawsuit over his arrest outside an immigration detention center should be tossed because both the government and Habba are immune from suit, and the court cannot impose a damages remedy under U.S. Supreme Court precedent.  According to the article, Habba said the lawsuit \"should be tossed\" and that \"both the government and Habba are immune from suit,\" adding that the court \"cannot impose a damages remedy\" under Supreme Court precedent.

Chuck Grassley, R\u2011Iowa, has highlighted a delay in confirming 10 U.S. attorney nominees, including Erik\u202fSiebert for the Eastern District of Virginia.  The nomination has been stalled by a Democratic hold on the Senate floor, which Grassley says is a blanket obstruction of all nominees.  Grassley stated, 'We have 10 highly qualified nominees on the Senate floor right now waiting for confirmation, and there is no reason that we shouldn't get them to work for the American people today,' and added that Democrats are 'engaged in blanket obstruction of all nominees in their misguided attempt to derail the Trump administration.'  Sen.

Siebert has served in an interim capacity since January, when Jess\u202fAber resigned, and was re\u2011appointed by a federal judge in May; his formal nomination remains pending.  The article notes that the hold prevents voice votes on individual nominees, forcing a potential roll\u2011call that would consume extensive Senate time.

Durbin objected to Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley\u2019s request for a voice vote, citing precedent from former Senator J.D. Vance and past bipartisan holds that have stalled nominations. Durbin said, 'I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, that you did not agree with Senator Vance's actions back then, and I don't believe you do now, but we can't have one set of rules for Republican presidents and another for Democratic presidents.' The delay means the Senate must use floor time to process each nomination, depriving the ten communities\u2014Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and Philadelphia\u2014of leadership. Metcalf, who has served in an interim role since June and has overseen cases including a $770\u202fmillion Ponzi scheme indictment, was previously an assistant U.S. attorney in Maryland. The article notes that 94\u202f% of President Joe Biden\u2019s U.S. attorney nominees were approved by voice vote, while none received unanimous approval during the second Trump administration. Additionally, the Trump administration announced Brian David Miller for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and has yet to name a nominee for the Western District.

The probe was launched at the request of Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director Bill\u202fPulte and is being conducted by U.S. Attorney Ed\u202fMartin, who was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Pam\u202fBondi as a special assistant to assist with mortgage\u2011fraud cases involving public officials. Prosecutors in the North District of Georgia and the Eastern District of Michigan are handling the case. The investigation follows former President Donald\u202fTrump\u2019s August\u202f25 firing of Kuk, who was accused of providing false information on mortgage applications. In a letter to Kuk, Trump said he had \"sufficient grounds to remove\" her, citing that in 2021 she listed two properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on loan documents. Kuk\u2019s lawyer, Washington attorney Ebba\u202fLowe, replied that the president has no authority to fire her and that the removal would be challenged in court. Lowe also said the president\u2019s actions \"have no legal basis.\" Kuk\u2019s term on the Federal Reserve Board expires in 2038, but the law allows removal for \"good cause,\" a provision that has never been used before. The article notes that Kuk obtained mortgage loans before her appointment to the Fed; her 2024 disclosure lists three loans, two of which were for personal residence, and the interest rates were above the national average. Mortgage fraud, the article explains, involves deceiving banks to secure more favorable terms, and the investigation seeks to determine whether Kuk engaged in such conduct.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 07:41 AM\nSource:[Forbes.ru](https://www.forbes.ru/finansy/545333-reuters-uznal-ob-ugolovnom-rassledovanii-protiv-clena-soveta-upravlausih-frs-lizy-kuk)\n\n**U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton approved by judges to remain as top prosecutor in N.Y.**\nAccording to the article, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Jay Clayton, has been approved by the federal judges of the Southern District of New York to continue in the role, even though he has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The judges\u2019 decision, announced by Southern District Executive Edward Friedland, allows Clayton to serve unless a new nominee is approved by the Senate. Clayton, who served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 2017 to 2020 and has more than two decades of experience at a prominent international law firm, said: 'I am honored to continue serving the people of New York together with the talented and hardworking women and men of the Office.' The move follows a pattern in which Trump\u2011appointed U.S. attorneys have faced judicial rejection in other districts, prompting the administration to use alternative legal mechanisms to keep its picks in place. In the Northern District of New York, for example, judges rejected John A. Sarcone III, who was then appointed as a special attorney to the attorney general to allow him to continue in the role. Similar challenges have arisen in New Jersey with Alina Habba and in other jurisdictions with Bilal \u201cBill\u201d Essayli and Sigal Chattah. The article notes that the administration\u2019s appointments normally require Senate confirmation, but Democratic senators in the nominees\u2019 home states can block the process, giving the appointed prosecutor a 120\u2011day period before judges decide whether to retain them. The Southern District\u2019s decision is portrayed as a victory for the Trump administration, which has used unorthodox maneuvers to keep its nominees in office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 11:55 PM\nSource:[nystateofpolitics.com](https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/news/2025/08/18/u-s--attorney-jay-clayton-approved-by-judges-to-remain-as-top-prosecutor-in-new-york)\n\n**The Senate faces a reality check on blue slips**\nThe Hill article explains why President Trump\u2019s nominee for U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, has stalled: both New Jersey senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, refuse to return the blue\u2011slip that signals consent to a nomination. The piece outlines the blue\u2011slip tradition, a century\u2011old Senate Judiciary Committee practice that gives a state\u2019s senators veto power over federal appointments in their state. It notes that in 2017, Chairman Chuck Grassley ended the blue\u2011slip veto for circuit\u2011court nominees, enabling Trump to reshape the Ninth Circuit; the article cites that this reform removed the veto power of senators from California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.\n\nThe article describes how Democrats have slowed nominations in Trump\u2019s second term, aided by a handful of Republicans who are reluctant to work. It quotes Senator Thom Tillis, who said he will not support any nominee unless the nominee\u2019s home\u2011state senators return their blue slips, and notes that without Tillis Republicans lack the votes on the committee to move nominees to a floor vote. The author, Michael Zona, a former communications director for Chuck Grassley, writes that the blue\u2011slip rule remains \"sacrosanct\" to a few Republican senators and that the Senate is \"behind the times.\" The piece concludes that unless Republicans gain a majority, the rule will persist and that the Senate should focus on working within the current system.\n\nKey metrics and evidence: 2017 reform of the blue\u2011slip rule; 16 months remaining in the current Congress; 60 votes required for a discharge petition; quotes from Tillis and Zona; mention of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s overhaul; and the statement that \"I worked for Chairman Grassley\" (Michael Zona).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5484959-trump-nominee-blue-slip/)\n\n**Jeanine Pirro doubles down on demand for judge to promptly 'oust' official once and for all**\nFormer Fox News host and U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro filed a quo warranto action in mid\u2011July seeking to have the federal court declare that President Donald Trump lawfully removed CPB board member Diane Kaplan and that Kaplan is therefore \"ousted and excluded\" from the board. Pirro argues that the DOJ\u2019s earlier dismissal of claims against Laura G. Ross and Thomas E. Rothman leaves Kaplan as the sole defendant. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia contends that \"Any way you slice it, under executive removal precedents or under D.C. corporate law, the President had the power to remove Defendant at will,\" and requests summary judgment in favor of the United States. Pirro also contends that Kaplan has attempted to maintain a position through a CPB\u2011created contingency plan, citing a document dated June\u202f8\u202f2025 that purportedly appoints a \"contingent designated body\" under Article\u202fV of the CPB bylaws. The court documents state that the contingency would only activate if the board fell below the statutory minimum of three directors. Pirro maintains that Kaplan is not currently serving on such a body and that the contingency plan would allow her to remain in a temporary role until the President nominates and the Senate confirms a replacement. The article notes that the CPB lawsuit, filed in April, sought an injunction against Trump\u2019s removal of Kaplan, Rothman and Ross, but a federal judge in June dismissed the claim that Trump lacked authority to remove the board members. Pirro has now sought summary judgment, with Ross and Rothman already dismissed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 02, 2025 07:41 PM\nSource:[Law & Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/pirro-doubles-down-on-demand-for-judge-to-immediately-oust-official-after-revelation-of-backup-plan-to-stave-off-trump-firing/)\n\n**Judge Rules Trump\u2019s Former Lawyer Alina Habba Illegally Serving as New Jersey\u2019s Chief Federal Prosecutor**\nA federal judge in New Jersey ruled on August 21, 2025 that Alina Habba, who had served as President Trump\u2019s private lawyer, was illegally acting as the state\u2019s chief federal prosecutor since July. Judge Matthew Brann\u2019s 77\u2011page decision concluded, '\u9762\u5bf9\u54c8\u5df4\u5973\u58eb\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u6cd5\u5c65\u884c\u65b0\u6cfd\u897f\u5dde\u8054\u90a6\u68c0\u5bdf\u5b98\u804c\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u3002', and stated that because she lacks the authority to exercise the office, she must be barred from any ongoing cases. The ruling also declared that any prosecutions conducted under her supervision are invalid from July\u202f1, 2025, though the judge will not enforce the order until a higher court reviews it, allowing Habba to remain in her position temporarily.\n\nPresident Trump appointed Habba as interim U.S. attorney in March 2024 for a 120\u2011day term. When that term expired in July, the district judge appointed her deputy Desiree Grace as successor, but the Department of Justice immediately fired Grace and reappointed Habba as a \"Special Attorney to the Attorney General.\" Under federal law, an interim attorney\u2019s term ends unless the judge appoints a new interim or the Senate confirms a nominee; Habba\u2019s case is the only one currently litigated for violating this rule.\n\nThree criminal defendants in New Jersey sued, arguing that Habba had no authority to prosecute them after July and sought to have their charges dismissed. Judge Brann agreed that Habba lacked authority but refused to dismiss the charges, instead invalidating any actions taken under her supervision. The DOJ maintains that the President has broad discretion to appoint attorneys, asserting, '\u603b\u7edf\u5df2\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u9664\u54c8\u5df4\u5916\uff0c\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u4ee5\u4e34\u65f6\u8eab\u4efd\u586b\u8865\u7f8e\u56fd\u68c0\u5bdf\u5b98\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u7f3a\u3002' Pam Bondi, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, announced she would appeal the ruling and posted on X, '\uff08\u54c8\u5df4\uff09\u5728\u65b0\u6cfd\u897f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u975e\u5e38\u51fa\u8272 -- -- \u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u4fdd\u62a4\u5979\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\uff0c\u514d\u53d7\u53f8\u6cd5\u6fc0\u8fdb\u6d3e\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002'\n\nHabba has also investigated New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy\u2019s immigration policy, though no charges have yet been filed.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 07:13 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/8/22/n14578809.htm)\n\n**Alina Habba blocked from handling cases in rebuke to Trump**\nU.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled that Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney in New Jersey, was not lawfully performing the duties of the office because her appointment was invalid. Brann said, 'Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not.' The judge found Habba had been serving without valid authority since July\u202f1,\u202f2025, and that her actions since that date 'may be declared void.' The ruling blocks Habba from supervising or engaging in prosecutions of criminal defendants who challenged her appointment and applies to prosecutors working under her direction. The case arose after federal judges in New Jersey had selected Desiree Grace for a 120\u2011day interim term and a four\u2011year nomination that stalled in the Senate. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace, appointed Habba as 'special attorney to the attorney general,' then as first assistant U.S. attorney, and used the Federal Vacancies Reform Act to name her acting U.S. attorney. Brann rejected the Trump administration's maneuvers to circumvent the law that allows district judges to appoint a U.S. attorney when an interim official's 120\u2011day term expires, warning that accepting the government's reading would give the executive a permanent means of thwarting that provision.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 10:26 PM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3820883)\n\n**Breaking: Federal Judge Declares Appointment of Trump's Personal Lawyer As US Attorney Illegal**\nChief U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled that Alina Habba, appointed by President Trump as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, had been unlawfully serving since July\u202f1,\u202f2025, because her term could not exceed 120 days under 28\u202fU.S.C. \u00a7\u202f546. Brann said Habba\u2019s term ended no later than July\u202f28,\u202f2025, calling into question all actions by that office after that date. The article traces the timeline: Philip R. Sellinger resigned on January\u202f8,\u202f2025; Vikas Khanna became Acting U.S. Attorney until March\u202f8, when John Giordano was appointed interim; on March\u202f24 Trump announced Habba; Pam Bondi swore her in on March\u202f28. Under federal law, an interim U.S. Attorney may serve only 120 days, so Habba\u2019s term would have expired on July\u202f26,\u202f2025. Trump nominated her on June\u202f30, giving the Senate only 26 days to act. On July\u202f22, district judges invoked their statutory power to appoint a U.S. Attorney after the 120\u2011day term expired, appointing Desiree Grace. Trump\u2019s DOJ objected, and the judge ordered the appointment to be held pending appeal.

Judge Matthew W. Brann\u2019s 77\u2011page opinion, issued on August\u00a021,\u00a02025, removed Habba from all ongoing cases, including those involving Cesar Humberto Pina, Julien Giraud Jr., and Julien Giraud III. The dispute began when former U.S. attorney Philip R. Sellinger stepped down at the end of the Biden administration, and his first assistant Vikas Khanna served as acting U.S. attorney until March\u00a02025. Trump then named John Giordano interim U.S. attorney, but on March\u00a024,\u00a02025 announced on Truth Social that 'Alina Habba... will be our interim U. Attorney for the District of New Jersey... effective immediately,' and she was sworn in on March\u00a028,\u00a02025 for a 120\u2011day interim term that was to expire in late July. On July\u00a07,\u00a02025, Habba signed Pina\u2019s indictment, but on July\u00a022, the court appointed her first assistant Desiree Leigh Grace as U.S. attorney, a move the Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized, saying 'politically minded judges refused to allow [Habba] to continue in her position' and that Grace had 'just been removed.' The next day Grace pledged to 'serve in accordance with the law,' while the Trump administration attempted to keep Habba in power by withdrawing her nomination, having her resign as interim U.S. attorney, appointing her as a special attorney to the attorney general, and then elevating her to acting U.S. attorney under federal vacancy rules. On July\u00a026, the administration sent Grace a letter stating her appointment never became valid and that 'the President of the United States has removed you from that office today.' After hearings and briefs, Judge Brann concluded that Habba had been serving without lawful authority since July\u00a01,\u00a02025 and barred her from participating in the prosecutions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:28 PM\nSource:[Daily Voice](https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/yonkers/federal-judge-says-trump-linked-prosecutor-has-been-illegally-running-njs-top-law-office/)\n\n**Former Trump attorney Alina Habba is serving unlawfully as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, judge rules**\nU.S. District Judge Matthew Brann of Pennsylvania ruled that former President Trump lawyer Alina Habba has been serving as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey without lawful authority since July\u00a01, 2025, and must be disqualified from supervising any ongoing cases. The judge\u2019s decision followed challenges by three men facing criminal charges\u2014two charged with drug offenses and one with investment fraud and bribery\u2014who argued that Habba\u2019s appointment as acting U.S. attorney violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Brann wrote, 'Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not,' and added that she has served unlawfully since July\u00a01. The ruling does not invalidate the indictments of the three defendants, but it bars Habba from supervising their prosecutions and is on hold pending a possible appeal by the Justice Department. Earlier this year, Habba was named interim U.S. attorney, a role limited to 120 days unless extended by the district court or confirmed by the Senate; New Jersey senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim opposed her nomination. When the 120\u2011day limit approached, district court judges installed her second\u2011in\u2011command, Desiree Leigh Grace, as acting prosecutor, but Attorney General Pam Bondi subsequently fired Grace. To circumvent the judge\u2019s order, President Trump withdrew Habba\u2019s nomination to serve as the top federal prosecutor, allowing her to remain in an acting capacity until the court\u2019s order. Brann emphasized that the Trump administration could only appoint an interim U.S. attorney for 120 days, a clock that began in early March when Habba\u2019s predecessor was appointed, not in late March when Habba assumed the role. He also struck down the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to label her a 'special attorney', stating that without the official title she cannot perform the duties of U.S. attorney.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:26 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney-unlawfully-judge-rules/)\n\n**Alina Habba defiant after judges vote against her in New Jersey: 'I don't cower to pressure'**\nAlina Habba, a former personal defense attorney to President Donald Trump, has announced that she does not plan to leave her role as the temporary U.S. attorney of New Jersey, despite federal judges voting against extending her term.

A Department of Justice spokesman confirmed that Habba is now serving as the 'acting' U.S. attorney, rather than the 'interim' position she previously held. The maneuver by President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi to keep Habba as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey is governed by federal vacancy laws, which gave the New Jersey district court judges the authority to vote on whether to extend Habba's 120-day term or to replace her.

    "summary": "Across a diverse panel of experts\u2014including specialists in federal legal practice, US government affairs, public administration, political science, and law\u2014the overwhelming consensus is that Alina Habba is unlikely to remain the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey on December 31, 2025. All forecasters highlighted the following core points:\n\n1. The legal basis for Habba's appointment is extremely weak after a federal court ruled her service unlawful. This creates strong headwinds for her continued tenure, and base rates for similar situations suggest removal is the most likely outcome.\n\n2. The Trump administration and Attorney General Pam Bondi have demonstrated determination to keep Habba in place through creative statutory maneuvers and persistent resistance to judicial rulings, which marginally increases her chances of remaining temporarily.\n\n3. The expedited appeals process\u2014scheduled to conclude well before the resolution date\u2014means a final judicial outcome is likely by year's end. Experts believe the judiciary's assertiveness and strong statutory foundation make a successful defense of Habba\u2019s position on appeal unlikely.\n\n4. Senate obstruction and blue-slip traditions make a regular, confirmed replacement unlikely, but this does not significantly improve Habba\u2019s odds given the legal challenges and court authority to appoint a replacement.\n\n5. The practical standstill in federal criminal prosecutions in New Jersey adds pressure for a resolution, making indefinite legal limbo unsustainable.\n\n6. The official U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office website will serve as the tiebreaker; some experts noted a residual chance that bureaucratic inertia or further legal wrangling could delay an update past December 31, but this is considered improbable.\n\nProbabilities assigned by individual experts ranged from 10%-20% for Habba remaining in office through the resolution date, with only one outlier at 30%. All group discussions converged on the expectation that the judiciary will prevail in removing her, and that the unique willingness of the Trump administration to defy legal norms does not fully offset the statutory and judicial obstacles. The scenario described by all as most probable is the appeals court upholding the district court\u2019s decision, followed by Habba\u2019s removal and the office\u2019s website reflecting a new head before year\u2019s end.\n\nIn summary, while there remains a slim chance of continued executive defiance or procedural delay, the consensus is that legal, institutional, and operational factors make it highly unlikely that Alina Habba will be U.S. Attorney for New Jersey on December 31, 2025.",
