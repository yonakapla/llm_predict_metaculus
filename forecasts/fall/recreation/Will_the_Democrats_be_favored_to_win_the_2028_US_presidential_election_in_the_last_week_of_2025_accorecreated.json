Historically, even after major party setbacks, prediction markets gravitate toward parity or a slight Democratic edge\u2014especially when the Republican field is unsettled and the event horizon is years away. Your forecast overweights recent Republican wins and public sentiment, and underweights market structure, participant bias, and the tendency for market pricing to resist sharp corrections until candidate matchups or real scandals emerge.

Despite a brutal 2024 for Democrats, the market\u2019s fundamental tendency is to revert to parity or a slight out-party edge unless there\u2019s a clear, credible narrative that the center has permanently shifted rightward. With neither party\u2019s nominee set and with plenty of time for the political winds to shift, it makes sense that Kalshi would keep the Democrats as narrow favorites even amid a negative news cycle. The Median Voter Theorem reminds us that both parties are incentivized to drift to the middle, and unless Republicans can lock in their coalition or Democrats further implode, the market will hedge its bets.

The poll found Trump has 42\u202f% support on immigration, higher than former President Joe Biden\u2019s 26\u202f% (Reuters poll December\u202f2024). For a brief period (late February\u2011early March), 50\u202f% of Americans approved of Trump\u2019s mass\u2011deportation policies. Trump\u2019s overall approval on the economy is 35\u202f%, slightly below Biden\u2019s 34\u202f% (December\u202f2024). The poll also shows Trump and Republicans are more trusted than Democrats on most key issues, with 54\u202f% of respondents saying the economy is on the wrong track, up from 52\u202f% in July. Former White House strategist Alyssa Farah Griffin is quoted: 'I think if the election were re\u2011held today, Donald Trump would win by the same if not a bigger margin.'

She cited a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found 40% of voters trust Republicans to handle crime and immigration, compared with 20% for Democrats and 22% for Democrats on those issues. The poll also showed Republicans leading Democrats on foreign conflicts, the economy, gun control and political extremism, while Democrats had a plurality on respect for democracy, healthcare, the environment and women's rights. Another Ipsos/Washington Post poll reported Republicans ahead by 7% on the economy, 13% on immigration and 22% on crime, suggesting potential trouble for Democrats in the 2026 midterms. Griffin\u2019s remarks were met with audible groans from the audience and a sharp retort from co\u2011host Joy Behar.

I think if the election were re\u2011held today, Donald Trump would win by the same if not a bigger margin,' and her follow\u2011up: 'This country is so deeply polarized, if you hated [Trump] before, you hate him even more now.' The piece also notes exit polling from November 2024, where Trump secured every swing state, became the first Republican nominee in 20 years to win the popular vote, and made significant gains among Hispanic and blue\u2011collar voters, including the first Republican to win the Hispanic male vote.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[The Western Journal](https://www.westernjournal.com/view-co-host-triggers-panel-saying-trump-win-bigger-margin-2024-election-held-now/)\n\n**'View' crowd groans at Alyssa Farah Griffin's unsettling Donald Trump projection**\nOn September 26, 2025, ABC\u2019s talk show The View featured former Trump staffer Alyssa Farah Griffin, who sparked a heated debate by predicting that Donald Trump would win a re\u2011held election by a similar or larger margin.

Griffin countered Behar\u2019s point about democracy, saying, 'I think that people throw around the term 'democracy.'

Prediction markets show a 43% chance of a shutdown before year\u2011end, with over $1.2\u202fmillion wagered on the outcome. The uncertainty has already triggered a sharp sell\u2011off: Bitcoin fell 5.73% from about $104,000 to $96,522, Ethereum dropped 9.85% to $3,511, and Solana plunged 13% to $196, wiping more than $1.1\u202fbillion in market value. The decline continued throughout the week, with Ethereum breaking below $4,000 for the first time since August and the broader market erasing over $140\u202fbillion in value. Current prices show a modest rebound\u2014Ethereum at $4,018 and Bitcoin at $109,568\u2014yet both remain below recent peaks, with Bitcoin\u2019s all\u2011time high of $115,970 reached on September\u202f14,\u202f2025.\n\nA shutdown would reduce the SEC\u2019s staff to 10% of normal, limiting regulatory action on crypto. This could delay ETF approvals and new rule proposals, even though the SEC and CFTC recently issued joint guidance permitting spot crypto trading on registered exchanges. \"A shutdown would stall critical progress on crypto policy,\" said Jessica Martinez of the Blockchain Association.\n\nHistorical context shows that the 2018\u20112019 shutdown (35\u202fdays) delayed crypto approvals, and each week of closure typically costs the U.S. economy about $7\u202fbillion. The crypto market, valued at over $2\u202ftrillion globally, could face significant disruption. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand warned, \"I don't want to put an artificial deadline on anything,\" highlighting the prioritisation of budget battles over crypto legislation. Despite these risks, industry leaders remain optimistic, noting bipartisan support for crypto regulation.\n\nThe article concludes that while a shutdown would not cause permanent damage, it would create uncertainty and delay regulatory progress for months, underscoring the crypto market\u2019s dependence on traditional government decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 09:30 PM\nSource:[Brave New Coin](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/government-shutdown-threatens-crypto-markets-as-political-deadlock-intensifies)\n\n**Trump's No.1 policy that Republicans can ride into 2028 election**\nPresident Donald Trump should further emphasize immigration to position Republicans for a 2028 win, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,016 Americans surveyed from September\u202f19\u201121.

While some view the correction as a buying opportunity, others fear the rally may have ended. Eric Trump, son of the U.S. president, remains optimistic, claiming Bitcoin could soon exceed $1\u202fmillion and that Ethereum also holds promise. He has previously advised buying Ethereum at $3,500, a recommendation that was followed by a price drop, suggesting his forecasts should be treated as sentiment indicators rather than reliable trading signals. The piece notes that the fourth quarter has historically been the strongest period for Bitcoin, supporting the idea that a rally could continue. Critics point to the well\u2011known four\u2011year cycle that would predict an imminent peak, but many analysts argue that institutional adoption has overridden these cycles, potentially allowing growth into 2025 and 2026. The article also highlights the altcoin Snorter ($SNORT), which has attracted attention for its meme\u2011coin hype combined with practical features such as a Telegram\u2011integrated trading bot, sniper, copy\u2011trading, stop\u2011loss, take\u2011profit, and smart\u2011contract scanning to guard against rug pulls. The $SNORT token is currently in pre\u2011sale, with over $4\u202fmillion already invested before any exchange listing, and analysts expect it to surge post\u2011launch.

In some markets the prices of 'Yes' and 'No' shares did not sum to one dollar, creating an immediate profit opportunity.  In other cases, logically linked markets such as \"Trump wins the presidency\" versus \"Republican wins the presidency\" were priced differently, enabling traders to lock in gains regardless of the outcome.  The study estimates that arbitrageurs have already extracted more than $40\u202fmillion from Polymarket, and it identified over 7,000 markets with measurable mispricing, many of which are highly liquid.  The authors note, 'Prediction markets are often treated as if they represent the collective intelligence of the crowd,' and add, 'But our results show they can deviate significantly from probabilistic consistency, even in markets with substantial trading activity.'  The paper argues that such inefficiencies are not unique to Polymarket; any platform that permits continuous, peer\u2011to\u2011peer trading of outcome tokens\u2014whether on crypto rails like Polymarket and Myriad or in regulated venues such as Kalshi\u2014is subject to the same structural forces.

The platform\u2019s success in the 2024 U.S. presidential election\u2014correctly predicting Donald Trump\u2019s victory and processing over $8\u202fbillion in bets\u2014has driven a surge in monthly active traders.  In contrast, Kalshi, a CFTC\u2011approved exchange based in New\u202fYork, closed a $185\u202fmillion round at a $2\u202fbillion valuation in June\u202f2025 and is now reportedly on the verge of a $5\u202fbillion valuation, reflecting investor confidence in its regulated, fiat\u2011based model.  Kalshi\u2019s markets recorded $441\u202fmillion in volume during the NFL\u2019s opening week in September\u202f2025, a figure the CEO, Tarek Mansour, likened to the intensity of a national election.  Both firms are positioned within a broader renaissance of prediction markets, with 2025 seeing over $216\u202fmillion invested across 11 deals\u2014triple the previous year\u2019s total\u2014while firms such as Coinbase and Crypto.com enter the space.  The article emphasizes that regulatory stability and user adoption will be key to these platforms\u2019 continued growth, but the current investor enthusiasm signals a potential shift toward mainstream acceptance of prediction markets as tools for gauging public sentiment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[Crowdfund Insider](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2025/09/251243-prediction-markets-polymarket-and-kalshi-may-target-higher-valuations-via-potential-funding-rounds/)\n\n**Polymarket Reportedly Targets Fall U.S. Launch, Football Trading**\nPolymarket, a crypto\u2011based prediction\u2011market platform, is preparing a fall 2025 launch in the United States after a three\u2011year hiatus. The company is advertising on Meta\u2011owned Facebook and Instagram, and one ad targets Texas residents with a promotion for 'legal football trading', a feature that would compete with established sportsbooks such as FanDuel and DraftKings and with other prediction markets like Kalshi. The NFL remains the most popular betting sport, generating billions of dollars in wagers during the second half of the year. Sports betting is legal in 38 U.S. states, with Missouri set to bring the total to 39 when wagering begins on Dec.\u202f1. Flutter, owner of FanDuel, has said that prediction markets have not affected its sportsbook in jurisdictions where it operates. Kalshi has offered 'Yes' and 'No' contracts on game outcomes since the Super Bowl in February, and has recently added NFL and college\u2011football markets with spreads and totals. FanDuel announced a partnership with CME Group that will allow it to offer financial prediction markets to its customers, though it has not indicated plans to offer sports\u2011outcome contracts. Polymarket, which was blocked from offering event trading in 2022 by the CFTC, acquired the federally regulated derivatives exchange QCEX for $112\u202fmillion in July, potentially enabling it to introduce sports contracts in the U.S. market. SimilarWeb data from May\u202f2025 show the platform had 15.9\u202fmillion visits, surpassing FanDuel and DraftKings, and it boasts a 94\u202f% accuracy rate in forecasting. Founded in 2020, Polymarket raised $200\u202fmillion earlier this year, pushing its valuation above $1\u202fbillion. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election, more than $3\u202fbillion in contracts were traded on the site. The company now faces a controversial landscape, as Kalshi, which gained traction during last year\u2019s election after a court ruling, is embroiled in legal disputes with several states over sports\u2011outcome contracts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/report-polymarket-targets-fall-us-launch-football-trading-aug-21-2025)\n\n**Polymarket Users Predict 2028 US Presidential Election Outcomes**\nAccording to the Polymarket platform, 56% of users believe that current Vice President JD Vance will be the Republican Party's candidate for the 2028 US presidential election. Marco Rubio, the current Secretary of State, is in second place with 7% of users making bets on him. Meanwhile, 5% of users think that former President Donald Trump will win the primaries, despite being ineligible for a third term.

According to Polymarket, Vice President J.D. Vance is the current frontrunner with 27% of the vote, followed by California Governor Gavin Newsom with 15%. Former President Donald Trump has 5% of the vote, despite not being constitutionally able to run for the election. A new poll by Echelon Insights found that Vance is the top Republican candidate with 42% of the vote, while Kamala Harris leads the Democratic primary with 26%. However, the poll and prediction markets differ, with prediction markets pricing in Harris not running or placing her odds of winning the election extremely low. Vance dominates both the polls and prediction markets, but a large number of bets are coming in on Trump, with some bettors predicting he could end up being allowed to run.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 20, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/news/politics/25/07/46510082/2028-election-odds-out-from-polymarket-vance-tops-list-at-27-trump-has-5-heres-what-voters-say-in-new-poll)\n\n**Vance, Buttigieg Top 2028 Election Poll, Plus Betting Odds - USData (OTC:USDC)**\nA new 2028 presidential election poll shows a mix of candidates for both the Republican and Democratic parties.

In contrast to the 2024 presidential election, where traders gave Trump a higher chance of winning than polls suggested, the mayoral election market on Kalshi was more accurate. Brad Tusk, managing partner at Tusk Venture Partners, noted that the correlation between bettors and voters was high in the presidential race, but there was less information available for the mayoral primary, which may have contributed to the accuracy of the prediction markets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 25, 2025 09:33 PM\nSource:[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/25/zohran-mamdani-nyc-primary-prediction-markets)\n\n**Wetten auf Trag\u00f6dien: The Ethics of Prediction Markets**\nPlatforms like Polymarket and Kalshi allow users to bet on global events in cryptocurrencies. Polymarket gained fame when it correctly predicted the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election. However, these prediction markets are banned in Switzerland, Belgium, and Thailand as they are considered illegal gambling. Experts warn that these platforms turn human tragedies into a game. For example, when the 'Titan' submarine with five passengers on board went missing in June 2023, users bet $300,000 on their fate, with some winning up to $8,000. Julien Pillot, a doctor of economics at the University of Nice, says that these platforms raise questions about the 'monetization of reality' and 'gamification.' Dominique Boullier, a sociologist at Sciences Po Paris, warns that these bets are not opinion polls and lack an ethical code and control. He suggests that the media should ignore these cases as they do not influence public debate. However, studies have shown that these bets can influence elections, creating an 'oracle effect.' A case in point is the 2024 Romanian presidential election, where an anonymous investor spent over $2.5 million to influence the popularity of George Simion on Polymarket. Alexandru Leca, a Romanian computer scientist, revealed that an algorithm was used to maintain Simion's rating by placing thousands of orders. 'It's a form of manipulation where the rating of a candidate is artificially maintained by placing tens of thousands of orders,' Leca said.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 09, 2025 06:17 AM\nSource:[SRF News](https://www.srf.ch/news/dialog/polymarket-und-co-wetten-auf-tragoedien-wie-wettplattformen-die-ethik-herausfordern)\n\n**Trump Claims Victory Over Harris In US Presidential Election | HowAfrica Latest news, views, gossip, photos and video**\nDonald Trump claimed victory over Kamala Harris in the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, declaring that he would \"help our country heal,\" according to a speech he gave at his Florida headquarters with his wife Melania and several children present.  Only Fox News had called the race for Trump at the time of the report, while other networks had not yet made a call.  Trump\u2019s supporters cheered and chanted \"USA\" as he spoke, and he noted that \"US networks have called the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina for the 78\u2011year\u2011old,\" while the other states had not yet been called.  The article also reports that Trump\u2019s Republican Party seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats and overturning a narrow Democratic majority.  Markets reacted positively: the U.S. dollar surged, bitcoin hit a record high, and most equity markets advanced as traders bet on a Trump win.  The piece highlights the political tension, noting that the FBI said bomb threats at polling stations in Georgia and Pennsylvania appeared to originate in Russia, though the threats were later deemed hoaxes.  Trump\u2019s campaign was bolstered by a post from Elon Musk, who said \"Game, set and match\" on X.  The article describes Trump\u2019s pledge to cut aid to Kyiv and to launch an unprecedented deportation campaign of millions of undocumented immigrants, and it mentions his criminal case over hush\u2011money payments and his denial of the 2020 election defeat.  Quotes from the article include: \"We are going to help our country heal,\" and \"You won\u2019t hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from her tomorrow,\" said Cedric Richmond, Harris campaign co\u2011chair.  The report presents the events with sensational language, emphasizing dramatic reactions and political implications.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 08:56 AM\nSource:[howafrica.com](https://howafrica.com/trump-claims-victory-over-harris-in-us-presidential-election/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across the diverse expert analyses, forecasts on whether Democrats will be favored to win the 2028 US presidential election in the last week of 2025 (according to Kalshi) center on the persistent closeness of prediction market pricing and competing influences from political fundamentals, market structure, and sentiment. The status quo, as of mid-to-late 2025, shows a slight Democratic edge in Kalshi and other prediction markets (often around 52% Democrats, 48% Republicans), despite recent decisive Republican victories and public polling/issue sentiment favoring the GOP.\n\nForecasters from election modeling, financial markets, political science, economics, and communication studies each note powerful Republican momentum post-2024 (due to Trump\u2019s victory, Senate gains, and polling leads on core issues). This generally lowers the probability of Democrats being favored. However, multiple experts highlight the tendency of prediction markets to mean-revert or display inertia near parity in the absence of decisive information or candidates, sometimes maintaining a Democratic edge out of structural/participant bias, demographic trends, or historical base rates.\n\nFactors raising the odds for Democrats include:\n- Prediction market status quo bias and mean reversion, especially well ahead of the election.\n- Structural advantages (e.g., Electoral College map, demographic trends) occasionally overweighted by traders.\n- Potential for Democratic recovery or a new, popular candidate to emerge.\n- Market inefficiency, participant composition, and the technical details of median price resolution.\n\nFactors lowering Democratic odds:\n- Republican momentum from 2024 victories and strong issue polling.\n- Democratic party disarray, lack of clear leadership, and negative elite/media framing.\n- Continued dominance of the GOP in the agenda-setting information environment.\n\nExperts diverge moderately in probabilities: the most pessimistic for Democrats estimate the chance they are favored at year-end 2025 as low as 35\u201345%, while the most optimistic are in the 63\u201368% range. Most cluster narrowly above or just below even odds (48\u201359%), with the median forecast falling around 54\u201358%. The principal source of spread is the weighting of market inertia/status quo bias (helping Democrats) versus the enduring strength of Republican fundamentals and negative Democratic narratives (hurting Democrats).\n\nIn summary, the consensus is that Democrats retaining favored status on Kalshi is narrowly but not strongly more likely than not, barring a dramatic change in candidate dynamics or political environment. Most experts expect the market to remain close, with small edges potentially determined by market technicalities, participant bias, and status quo inertia.",
