However, as a DCF-focused analyst, I note that the sector faces a non-trivial risk from potential changes in server/chip depreciation accounting, which could cause a one-off downward repricing if consensus shifts. Nonetheless, the probability of such a re-rating occurring and being severe enough to push Microsoft below $421.50 in Q4 is moderate but not dominant. Base rates for large-cap tech closing higher over a calendar year are high, especially when the company is operationally outperforming and macro conditions are supportive.

You recognize that supportive Fed policy and the lack of an imminent macro or regulatory shock make a late-year mega-cap reversal unlikely, but you still leave real room for tail risk from sector-wide accounting changes. That\u2019s the right approach: don't let narrative euphoria crowd out respect for 'unknown unknowns,' but also don't overstate the likelihood of a sudden meltdown when neither the Fed nor regulators are signaling alarm. You correctly note that the calendar and status quo inertia are powerful, and that sharp, persistent drawdowns are rare without a catalyst\u2014even for crowded trades. Your forecast threads the needle, assigning high confidence but not certainty. This is what disciplined, probabilistic thinking looks like."

Nvidia projects the AI infrastructure market to grow from about $600\u202fbillion today to $3\u20134\u202ftrillion in the coming years. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL/GOOG) has turned AI into a growth driver: search revenue has risen, AI\u2011powered features such as Overviews, Lens and Circle to Search are driving more commercial queries, and a federal court decision preserved its Android and Chrome distribution advantage. Alphabet\u2019s cloud business grew 32% last quarter, with profits more than doubling, thanks to AI infrastructure demand; the company also plans to acquire cloud\u2011security firm Wiz.

There have been lots of questions about whether the backlog is real post that Oracle news, but they have, they seem to have been resolved to the point that it is positive, and demand looks very strong. Microsoft's Azure, Meta's AI, NVIDIA's chips, Tesla's autonomous driving, Google's Gemini, Amazon's Web Service would all seem to be big beneficiaries of that demand, meaning that they're probably doing so well that you see... the demand.'

It cites Gartner\u2019s estimate that worldwide spending on hardware and software nudged $1trn last year and is projected to double to $2trn by 2026, with the five firms expected to spend over $1trn on capital investments between 2024 and 2026.  Nvidia and Broadcom, whose combined market capitalisation is $6trn, are forecast to book almost $1trn in sales over that period.  The piece notes that Microsoft moved its server depreciation from four to six years in 2022, Alphabet did the same in 2023, Amazon and Oracle from five to six years in 2024, and Meta from five to five\u2011half years in January 2025; Amazon later reversed to five years, cutting 2025 operating profit by $700m (\u22481\u202f%).  It quotes Jensen Huang saying \u2018when Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn\u2019t give Hoppers away,\u2019 implying a 12\u2011month useful life for new chips, and Jim Chanos warning that if Meta\u2019s chips last only two to three years, \u2018most of its profits are materially overstated.\u2019  The article estimates that if servers lose value in three years instead of the longer schedules, the combined pre\u2011tax profit of the five firms would fall by $26bn (8\u202f% of last year\u2019s total), translating to a $780bn hit to market capitalisation.

There have been lots of questions about whether the backlog is real post that Oracle news, but they have, they seem to have been resolved to the point that it is positive, and demand looks very strong. Microsoft's Azure, Meta's AI, NVIDIA's chips, Tesla's autonomous driving, Google's Gemini, Amazon's Web Service would all seem to be big beneficiaries of that demand, meaning that they're probably doing so well that you see... the demand.' The article notes that Microsoft develops software, cloud services and devices such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics, LinkedIn, Azure, GitHub, Windows, Surface, Xbox, search and advertising solutions, and AI tools like Copilot. While acknowledging Microsoft\u2019s potential, the piece states that 'certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.'

It cites Gartner\u2019s estimate that worldwide spending on hardware and software nudged $1trn last year and is projected to double to $2trn by 2026, with the five firms expected to spend over $1trn on capital investments between 2024 and 2026.  Nvidia and Broadcom, whose combined market capitalisation is $6trn, are forecast to book almost $1trn in sales over that period.  The piece notes that Microsoft moved its server depreciation from four to six years in 2022, Alphabet did the same in 2023, Amazon and Oracle from five to six years in 2024, and Meta from five to five\u2011half years in January 2025; Amazon later reversed to five years, cutting 2025 operating profit by $700m (\u22481\u202f%).  It quotes Jensen Huang saying \u2018when Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn\u2019t give Hoppers away,\u2019 implying a 12\u2011month useful life for new chips, and Jim Chanos warning that if Meta\u2019s chips last only two to three years, \u2018most of its profits are materially overstated.\u2019  The article estimates that if servers lose value in three years instead of the longer schedules, the combined pre\u2011tax profit of the five firms would fall by $26bn (8\u202f% of last year\u2019s total), translating to a $780bn hit to market capitalisation.

(Hint: Oracle's Not One)**\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL) announced a projection that its cloud infrastructure revenue would rise to $144\u202fbillion over the next five years, a figure largely secured by non\u2011cancellable contracts.  Despite the headline\u2011making stock surge, the author argues that Oracle is unlikely to be the biggest beneficiary of its own cloud push because the company carries a heavy debt load, generates no free cash flow, and will need to spend heavily on capital expenditures to capture the projected revenue.  The article notes that the economics of the forecasted revenue are uncertain and that the three dominant cloud providers\u2014Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL/GOOG)\u2014have largely opted out of pursuing this opportunity.  Instead, Oracle is expected to build data centers for them.  Consequently, the author identifies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) as the two companies better positioned to benefit from Oracle\u2019s spending spree.  Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI infrastructure is highlighted by its 94\u202f% market share in the GPU space in Q2, a 56\u202f% surge in data\u2011center revenue to $41.1\u202fbillion, and a nearly doubled $7.3\u202fbillion in networking equipment sales.  Nvidia\u2019s competitive moat is built on its CUDA software platform and NVLink interconnect system, which enable developers to program GPUs for AI workloads and allow multiple GPUs to operate as a cohesive unit.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 07:35 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

In Q2, revenue rose 48% to $1\u202fbillion, and U.S. commercial sales nearly doubled, up 93% to $306\u202fmillion. The U.S. government remains its largest customer, with a $10\u202fbillion Army contract and a recent ICE deal. The article notes Palantir trades at high multiples, warning that execution risk could hurt the stock, but the opportunity is large. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) uses AI to improve content recommendations and advertising. Q2 advertising revenue grew 22% to $46.6\u202fbillion, and Meta is expanding ads on WhatsApp and Threads. CEO Mark Zuckerberg aims for Meta to lead in 'personal superintelligence' and is investing heavily in AI talent. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) integrated AI copilots into Microsoft\u202f365 and saw a 16% revenue jump last quarter; its Azure cloud revenue rose 39% last quarter, though capacity constraints limited growth. Microsoft is investing in GPUs and servers for AI workloads and sees quantum computing as a future growth driver.

To surpass their combined value, a company would need a market cap of $7.3\u202ftrillion by 2030. The author identifies Nvidia (NVDA) as the only plausible candidate, arguing that its AI\u2011driven GPU business and the continued spending of AI hyperscalers could drive Nvidia past that threshold. 'I think that a $7.3\u202ftrillion market cap is achievable for Nvidia by 2030,' the article states. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are the preferred hardware for AI workloads, and hyperscalers such as Alphabet and Meta are increasing capital expenditures\u2014Alphabet raised its 2025 cap\u2011ex projection to $85\u202fbillion, and Meta expects 'significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026' for building out its computing capacity. A third\u2011party estimate cited at Nvidia\u2019s 2025 GTC event puts global data\u2011center cap\u2011ex at $400\u202fbillion in 2024, projected to reach $1\u202ftrillion by 2028, implying a compounded annual growth rate of about 26\u202f%. Using that CAGR, Nvidia\u2019s revenue would grow from $149\u202fbillion to $335\u202fbillion and profits from roughly $74\u202fbillion (mid\u201150\u202f% margin) to $184\u202fbillion over the next 3\u00bd\u202fyears. Applying a forward P/E of 40, the model projects a market cap of $7.36\u202ftrillion by 2028, already exceeding the 2030 target. The article concludes that Nvidia is poised to remain dominant and that its stock will be a must\u2011own for investors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 09:15 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/21/prediction-this-supercharged-artificial-intelligen/)\n\n**US Stocks Open Higher on Strong Tech Gains**\nUS stocks opened higher on Thursday, driven by strong tech gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Index opened 1.13% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 0.66% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.19%. Microsoft and Meta Platforms shares surged after both companies reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Microsoft rose 5% and Meta rose 12%, boosting optimism in the broader technology sector. Microsoft's earnings came after the software giant reported a profit of $3.65 per share in the fourth quarter, beating analyst estimates of $3.37 per share. The company also announced that its Azure cloud computing service generated $75 billion in revenue, exceeding its strong position in the growing cloud infrastructure market. Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, rose sharply after it provided an optimistic outlook for third-quarter revenue, forecasting between $47.5 and $50.5 billion, significantly above analyst estimates of $46.16 billion. The positive forecast suggests continued strength in digital advertising and engagement on its platforms. Investors are now waiting for results from other Mag-7 components, including Apple and Amazon, which will report after the closing bell on Thursday. Markets are digesting the Fed's pause and inflation data. The market reaction followed a mixed session on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed lower on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a slight gain. The market reaction came after the US central bank held its benchmark interest rate in its July meeting, keeping it in a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, the decision was not unanimous, with Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller dissenting, indicating a growing split within the central bank. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that no monetary policy changes were made for September, and future steps will depend on data. The inflation data released on Thursday made inflation outlooks even more complex. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation indicator, rose 2.6% in the year-over-year comparison in June, slightly above the estimate of 2.5% from economists polled by Dow Jones. Weekly jobless claims for the week ending July 26 came in at 218,000, just below the expected 222,000. Market strategist Ross Mayfield, investment analyst at Baird, noted that current valuations are 'overdone' and that recent Fed comments could lead to a short-term consolidation. 'There are many good things already priced in, so I think small things at the margin can have a bigger impact when you've had a run like this,' he told CNBC. Trade tensions and stock movements also played a role. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that talks with China over tariffs are progressing, and both sides 'have the stuff of a deal.'

Markets are digesting the Fed's pause and inflation data. The moves on Thursday followed a mixed session on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed lower on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a slight gain.

Weekly jobless claims for the week ending July 26 were 218,000, just below the expected 222,000. Market strategist Ross Mayfield, investment analyst at Baird, noted that current valuations are 'overdone' and that recent Fed comments could lead to a short-term consolidation.

The company has experienced significant growth over the last decade, with its annual advertising revenue increasing from $11.5 billion in 2014 to $161 billion in 2024, driven by strong execution and major acquisitions, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts assign a high probability (ranging from 83% to 93%) that Microsoft stock will close 2025 higher than its starting price of $421.50, citing several reinforcing factors. The primary drivers for a 'Yes' outcome include strong momentum in AI and cloud segments (with Azure revenue and AI services repeatedly beating expectations), supportive macroeconomic conditions (notably the Federal Reserve signaling further rate cuts, which aid equity valuations), and robust institutional and retail sentiment toward large-cap tech stocks. Microsoft's diversified business, operational resilience, and leading position in AI/cloud provide additional insulation from sector rotation or competition. Base rates and historical context\u2014where tech mega-caps rarely finish down after a record-setting year without major shocks\u2014further support the expectation of a positive close.\n\nEvery expert flags the same primary risk: the potential for an accounting-driven repricing if depreciation schedules for AI/cloud infrastructure assets are forced to be shortened sector-wide, which could reduce reported profits and prompt multiple compression. This risk, while real, is generally viewed as more likely to unfold gradually or in future periods beyond 2025, rather than sparking an abrupt Q4 shock. Other secondary risks include overvaluation, possible late-year sector correction, exogenous macro/geopolitical shocks, and (less likely) regulatory action. Nonetheless, with about 2.5 months to go and Microsoft already above the threshold, the consensus is that only a dramatic, unforeseen event would reverse its gains enough to result in a 'No' outcome.\n\nOverall, the experts' forecasts converge in assigning a very high\u2014but not absolute\u2014probability to a 'Yes', balancing the strong operative and macro backdrop against tail risks that remain relatively remote in the time frame to resolution.",
