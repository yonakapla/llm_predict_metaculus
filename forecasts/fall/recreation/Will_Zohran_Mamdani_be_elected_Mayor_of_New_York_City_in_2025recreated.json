Endorsements from key Democratic leaders, including those previously cautious, suggest further consolidation is likely. The fragmented field actually helps Mamdani by splitting the opposition, while his ballot position and party affiliation maximize his turnout and straight-ticket support. His vulnerabilities (progressive stances, Israel/Palestine) are real but have not meaningfully dented his lead, and turnout modeling suggests he benefits from an energized base. The only plausible path to a 'No' is a late, major shock or sudden coalition among opponents, neither of which appears imminent given statements from Adams and Cuomo.

These are not likely, but they are more plausible than the 97% probability suggests. Thus, in deference to the tail risks and the real\u2014but still limited\u2014uncertainty in this fractured, identity-driven field, I am revising my probability downward modestly.",

A Marist poll released on September\u202f16 shows Mamdani leading former Gov. Andrew\u202fCuomo by 21\u202fpercentage points in a four\u2011way race that also includes Republican nominee Curtis\u202fSliwa and Adams. John\u202fWhitlow, a law professor at City University of New\u202fYork, writes in The\u202fNation that New\u202fYork City is the epicenter of a political and economic battle between Trump\u2019s \u201cbrand of despotism,\u201d rooted in 1980s real\u2011estate politics, and Mamdani\u2019s \u201cdemocratic socialism.\u201d Whitlow calls Trump\u2019s labeling of Mamdani a \u201ccommunist\u201d inaccurate, noting that Mamdani identifies as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d in the vein of Bernie\u202fSanders and Alexandria\u202fOcasio\u2011Cortez. Whitlow argues that Trump\u2019s real\u2011estate background\u2014acquiring Manhattan land after the 1970s fiscal crisis\u2014provides a \u201cthrough line\u201d to his governance style, and that Mamdani\u2019s housing platform threatens the neoliberal compact that has dominated the city\u2019s economy since the 1970s.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/the-right-wing/trump-mamdani-nyc/)\n\n**NY Democratic Party chair not endorsing Mamdani**\nNew York Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs announced on Thursday that he will not endorse Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. Jacobs said, 'Mr. Mamdani and I are in agreement that America's greatest problem is the continued growth of income disparity in our nation,' but added, 'On how to address it -- we fundamentally disagree.' He also criticized the \u2018fear mongering\u2019 around Mamdani\u2019s campaign and his views on Israel, stating that the Democratic Socialists of America does not represent the Democratic Party\u2019s principles. Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary in a surprise victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, has been a vocal critic of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and has threatened to order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visits the city. Jacobs\u2019 decision follows Governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s endorsement of Mamdani, who praised his \u2018can\u2011do spirit\u2019 while noting disagreements on policy. Neither Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Mamdani, despite meeting with him. New York State Senator Mike Gianaris called Jacobs\u2019 refusal to endorse \u2018disgraceful\u2019 in a post on X, questioning the party leader\u2019s role.

Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani earlier this week, but Schumer and Jeffries have yet to publicly endorse him. Liz Hohenberger of Our Revolution said the petition drive aims to \"over the line\" to secure endorsement: 'We're delivering over 85,000 petition signatures asking for Senator Schumer and Representative Jeffries to honor the primary elections and endorse the democratically elected nominee Zohran Mamdani for New\u202fYork City mayor.' Jeffries declined to comment, saying he would speak later. Schumer met with Mamdani last week and said, 'we had a very good conversation. We know each other well, and those conversations are continuing.' Polls show Mamdani with a double\u2011digit lead over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with the Republican candidate in third place and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams in fourth. The petition has drawn support from figures such as Alexandria Ocasio\u2011Cortez and Bernie Sanders, while others like Rep. Tom Suozzi oppose Mamdani: 'Sometimes change is more important than unity. And I think that the Democrats, we have to work on our brand. And I think that the message that Mr. Mamdani is standing for is not something that I agree with.' Trump criticized Hochul\u2019s endorsement on Truth Social, calling Mamdani a \"Liddle Communist\": 'Governor Kathy Hochul of New\u202fYork has endorsed the 'Liddle' Communist, Zohran Mamdani, running for Mayor of New\u202fYork.'

State Governor Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have endorsed Mamdani, giving him the backing of two of the state\u2019s most powerful Democrats. However, congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have been more cautious. Schumer said he met with Mamdani for a \u2018good conversation,\u2019 while Jeffries downplayed any concerns. Smikle, a longtime Democratic strategist, noted that \u2018the calculus for Hochul and Heastie\u2026is to find a way to embrace the movement he\u2019s created.\u2019 Hochul said, \u2018New York State and New York City are at our best when we stand together against those who attempt to tear us apart.\u2019 Heastie described Mamdani as an optimist promising a better direction for the city. Mamdani echoed the call for unity, saying, \u2018This is a time for unity. It is a time for strength, and it is a time to speak in one voice.\u2019 The article also mentions that the MTA lost nearly $1\u202fbillion in 2024 due to toll and fare evasion, and that Mamdani plans to make public transit free.

The endorsement appears to have prompted other establishment figures to follow suit. State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie is expected to back Mamdani this week, according to the New York Post. However, key progressive and moderate leaders\u2014House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u2014have declined to support the socialist candidate. The article notes that polls have Mamdani winning the race, even as his leading rivals, Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, have continued to downplay his margin of support.

A Data for Progress poll found that Democratic voters rate elected officials who describe themselves as democratic socialists about as positively as those who identify as Democrats, and that they prefer democratic socialism to capitalism when given written definitions. Nate\u202fSilver noted that Zohran\u202fMamdani\u2019s lead in the New\u202fYork City mayoral race is roughly 19 points \u2013 a margin that, given a 20\u2011point error range, gives him a 95\u202f% chance of winning. The report also reports that New\u202fYork City Mayor Kathy\u202fHochul\u2019s endorsement would pressure other high\u2011profile Democrats, such as House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck\u202fSchumer, to support Mamdani. In Georgia, the governor announced plans to run, while in Kentucky a candidate from the Transwestern real\u2011estate firm is positioning himself as an outsider. The report cites a 53\u201147 loss for Trump in a recent primary, a 72\u201122 defeat for a Wisconsin governor, and a 42\u201116 loss for a long\u2011serving legislator in another state. In New\u202fJersey, Democratic nominee Mikie\u202fSherrill faces GOP nominee Jack\u202fCiattarelli in an upcoming debate. The report also includes a quote from a political commentator: 'Conservatives in Alabama do not believe that the people of California or Massachusetts should be allowed to make their own decisions about their children\u2019s education, or health care.' It highlights the crowded field in Connecticut\u2019s 1st District, where former Hartford Mayor Luke\u202fBronin has pledged to self\u2011fund $500,000, and notes that the state\u2019s ballot\u2011access rules could limit the number of signatures required. Finally, the report covers a Minnesota special election in District\u202f34B, where Democratic nominee Xp\u202fLee, a Hmong refugee, defeated Republican Ruth\u202fBittner 63\u201137 in the primary and faces her in the general election. Overall, the report presents a data\u2011driven snapshot of the political landscape with key metrics and direct quotes from officials and analysts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[bluedelaware.com](https://bluedelaware.com/2025/09/17/the-political-report-september-17-2025/)\n\n**Trump says Zohran Mamdani likely to be New York's next mayor unless...**\nPresident Donald Trump said on a White House dinner that he believes Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New\u202fYork City\u2019s next mayor unless two of the three major candidates in the race drop out. Trump answered a reporter\u2019s question with a firm \u2018No\u2019 when asked if he had urged any candidate to quit, but added that he would like to see two people leave the race so it becomes a one\u2011on\u2011one contest.

That ain\u2019t happening.\u2019 He added, \u2018I can assure you for the 9,852nd time in this campaign I\u2019ve had to answer this: I\u2019m not dropping out.

Cuomo said, 'The fight to save our city isn\u2019t over,' and expressed his intention to win the general election in November. Cuomo's decision comes despite opposition from some of his traditional allies, including key labor unions and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who urged him to step aside. The general election will also feature incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, and Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol, who is running on the Republican line. Cuomo's campaign strategy contrasted with Mamdani's energetic street-level campaign centered around affordability issues.

Sliwa's campaign focuses on his decades-long fight against crime, but his 2023 arrest at an anti-immigration protest risks polarising voters. The November election, set for 4 November 2025, is shaping up as unusually competitive, with polls showing Mamdani leading but not dominating.

According to Mamdani, 'I will be your Democratic candidate for the office of Mayor of New York City.' Mamdani was born in Uganda to an Indian family and was supported by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during his campaign. Cuomo received backing from former US President Bill Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The current front-runner is Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old member of the New York State Assembly, who has been gaining ground on former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in recent polls. Mamdani, a Muslim candidate of Indian descent and Ugandan origin, is seen as a strong contender to become the first Muslim Mayor of New York City if he wins the primary election today. Mamdani represents the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which has been supportive of Palestine, while Cuomo represents the party's traditional wing and has been backed by pro-Israel lobbies. If Cuomo loses the primary election, he may run as an independent candidate in the general election on November 4. Current Mayor Eric Adams is not running in the primary election after facing criticism for his close ties to the Trump administration. The Republican Party has only one candidate, Curtis Sliwa, who is a radio host and the founder of the 'Guardian Angels' organization, which focuses on street safety. Sliwa is expected to face a strong Democratic opponent in the general election, given the city's demographics. In the primary election, voters can rank their top five choices, and if no candidate reaches 50% of the vote, the second-choice votes will be counted. Mamdani's campaign is seen as a strong contender in this system, especially if he can secure the second-choice votes of Brad Lander, another candidate.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 06:52 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/dunya/new-yorkta-demokrat-parti-belediye-baskan-adayi-icin-on-secim-yapiliyor/3611870)\n\n**From the vault: What burning questions do New Yorkers have for the next NYC mayor?**\nNew Yorkers were asked about their burning questions for the next city mayor ahead of the 2025 Democratic primary election mayoral debate. The issues that were front and center on their minds include the upcoming municipal primaries, where State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani leads the crowded 11-candidate Democratic primary field for New York City mayor, edging out former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo's run comes nearly four years after he resigned from office following allegations he sexually harassed 11 women. The winner of the Democratic mayoral primary is typically the heavy favorite for the general election in overwhelmingly Democratic-leaning New York City, but this year's party nominee will face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who was elected as a Democrat but skipped Tuesday's primary to run as an independent in November. Adams was indicted in a 2024 corruption case that President Donald Trump's Justice Department later dropped.

    "summary": "All expert forecasts converge on an extremely high probability (92\u201397%) that Zohran Mamdani will be elected Mayor of New York City in 2025. Forecasters from diverse disciplines\u2014ranging from urban sociology, polling analysis, campaign strategy, and political science to American Studies\u2014cite overlapping structural factors. The dominant drivers of Mamdani\u2019s frontrunner status are: (1) the overwhelming Democratic base rate and historic dominance in NYC mayoral elections, (2) consistent double-digit polling leads against fractured opposition, (3) persistent fragmentation among his main rivals (Cuomo and Adams, both now independents, and Sliwa as a weak Republican), and (4) robust turnout and coalition-building fueled by demographic and ideological realignment in the city. While all acknowledge some resistance from establishment Democrats (e.g., withholdings by Schumer/Jeffries and some negative reactions to Mamdani\u2019s stances on Israel/Palestine), this is deemed insufficient to offset his polling and grassroots advantages, especially after endorsements from Governor Hochul and other key state leaders. The main tail risks identified are the unlikely prospects of a last-minute scandal or rapid consolidation of anti-Mamdani voters\u2014such as if Adams or Cuomo were to drop out and endorse the other\u2014which could, in theory, threaten his path. Nevertheless, the short time until the election, lack of precedent for late rallies against such clear leads, and NYC\u2019s historical voting patterns underpin near-consensus: barring a highly improbable late shock, Mamdani is virtually certain to win.",
