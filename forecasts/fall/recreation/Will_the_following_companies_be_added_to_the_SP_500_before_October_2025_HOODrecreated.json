Instead, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP), Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) and Emcor Group (NYSE:EME) would join the index. Analysts cited heavy reliance on Bitcoin, the fact that Strategy had only one full year of GAAP profitability, and the committee\u2019s cautious history as possible reasons for the exclusion. Benchmark\u2019s Mark Palmer said 'the exclusion reflected the committee\u2019s cautious stance rather than Strategy\u2019s balance sheet', adding that the company remains a strong contender for future inclusion if profits hold. Jeff Walton of Strive Funds noted that Strategy\u2019s Q2 profits were 6.6 times higher than the three added firms combined and 2.5 times greater over the past year, making its exclusion difficult to justify. After the announcement, MSTR fell 1.78% to $329.90, while Robinhood surged 15.8% to $117.28.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 07:05 PM\nSource:[ValueWalk](https://www.valuewalk.com/news/strategy-snubbed-as-robinhood-emcor-applovin-join-sp-500/)\n\n**Strategy Misses S&P 500 Inclusion This Month: Will It Ever Make the Cut?**\nThe article reports that Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) was omitted from the S&P 500 during the latest index rebalancing, while AppLovin (APP), Robinhood (HOOD), and Emcor (EME) were added. Strategy meets the index\u2019s eligibility criteria\u2014U.S. domicile, market cap of at least $22.7\u202fbillion, profitability in the most recent quarter and over the last year, and sufficient public float\u2014but the S&P Index Committee also weighs sector weighting and other factors. The committee\u2019s decision is confidential, and the article notes that the committee added several bitcoin\u2011owning firms to the index this year, suggesting Strategy could be included in a future rebalancing if a spot opens. The piece cites Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who estimates $22\u202ftrillion is tied to S&P\u2011500\u2011based products, and Stephens, which projected that fund managers would need to purchase about 50\u202fmillion Strategy shares worth roughly $16\u202fbillion if the company were added. Strategy\u2019s $10\u202fbillion profit from bitcoin price gains in the last quarter is highlighted as evidence of its eligibility. The article quotes former committee chair David Blitzer, who said the committee\u2019s goal is \"to have an index that really is a great measure of the market,\" adding that the index should mirror market movements.

The Nasdaq Composite reached 21,798.699, up 98.311 points (0.45%).\n\nThe rally followed a weak August non\u2011farm payroll report and the Fed\u2019s \u201cblackout\u201d period before the September FOMC meeting, which has increased speculation that the Fed will lower rates. According to CME FedWatch, the probability of a 75\u2011basis\u2011point cut by December rose to 69.3% from 65.3% the previous day.\n\nInvestors are now focused on the upcoming August Producer Price Index (PPI) on the 11th and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the 12th, as a sharp inflation rebound could slow the pace of cuts. \"If inflation does not rise sharply this week, the Fed\u2019s cut is essentially confirmed,\" said Chris Larkin of iTrade, adding that the market will likely remain cautious until the CPI release.\n\nTech stocks showed mixed performance: Nvidia (+0.77%), Amazon (+1.51%), and Microsoft (+0.65%) gained modestly, while Apple (\u20110.76%), Meta (\u20110.02%), Alphabet (\u20110.34%), and Tesla (\u20111.27%) fell. Broadcom (+3.21%) and Palantir (+1.95%) continued to rally.\n\nIndividual stocks surged on index\u2011inclusion news: Robinhood jumped 15.83% and Apple\u2011Robinhood 11.59% after being added to the S&P\u202f500. In contrast, MicroStrategy, a Bitcoin\u2011holding company expected to be added, fell 1.78% after the inclusion was canceled.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 11:44 PM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/world/11414404)\n\n**Strategy Misses S&P 500 Inclusion This Month: Will It Ever Make the Cut?**\nThe article reports that Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) was omitted from the S&P 500 during the latest index rebalancing, while AppLovin (APP), Robinhood (HOOD), and Emcor (EME) were added. Strategy meets the index\u2019s eligibility criteria\u2014U.S. domicile, market cap of at least $22.7\u202fbillion, profitability in the most recent quarter and over the last year, and sufficient public float\u2014but the S&P Index Committee also weighs sector weighting and other factors. The committee\u2019s decision is confidential, and the article notes that the committee added several bitcoin\u2011owning firms to the index this year, suggesting Strategy could be included in a future rebalancing if a spot opens. The piece cites Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who estimates $22\u202ftrillion is tied to S&P\u2011500\u2011based products, and Stephens, which projected that fund managers would need to purchase about 50\u202fmillion Strategy shares worth roughly $16\u202fbillion if the company were added. Strategy\u2019s $10\u202fbillion profit from bitcoin price gains in the last quarter is highlighted as evidence of its eligibility. The article quotes former committee chair David Blitzer, who said the committee\u2019s goal is \"to have an index that really is a great measure of the market,\" adding that the index should mirror market movements. No opinion or loaded language is present, and the article sticks to factual reporting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 05:19 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Both firms have experienced record rallies over the past 12 months, soaring well over 400% and outpacing other tech favorites such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR).  The S&P 500 Index is rebalanced quarterly by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture of S&P Global (SPGI) and CME Group (CME); to qualify for inclusion a company must have a market capitalization of at least $22.7\u202fB and meet profitability, liquidity and other financial metrics, as well as qualitative judgment to ensure the index represents the U.S. economy.  The article notes that inclusion typically triggers a \u201cbig bounce\u201d as passive funds re\u2011balance their holdings, with the final effective date usually falling on one of the highest\u2011volume trading days of the year.

The update adds AppLovin Corp. (APP), Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), and Emcor Group Inc. (EME) to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), and Enphase Energy (ENPH), which will move to smaller\u2011cap indexes. Bloomberg reports that Robinhood\u2019s inclusion marks a shift from a pandemic\u2011speculation platform to a mainstream brokerage that now manages billions in assets across stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. The article cites that HOOD stock has gained over 434% in the past year and that being added to the S&P 500 automatically places the company into index funds, pensions, and retirement accounts worldwide, thereby expanding its institutional footprint. Other changes include Uber Technologies (UBER) joining the S&P 100, replacing Charter Communications (CHTR); MP Materials (MP) and Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS) moving into the S&P MidCap 400; and several firms\u2014Wendy\u2019s (WEN), MarketAxess, Caesars, Enphase, Acadia Healthcare (ACHC), and ManpowerGroup (MAN)\u2014transitioning to the S&P SmallCap 600.

If the company were accepted, passive index\u2011tracking funds would need to purchase roughly 50\u202fmillion shares, creating an estimated $16\u202fbillion inflow at current market prices.  The S&P\u202f500 committee evaluates liquidity, profitability, trading history, and sector balance; it requires a minimum market capitalization of $22.7\u202fbillion and positive income for the current and past four quarters.  Strategy\u2019s market cap exceeds $90\u202fbillion, comfortably above the threshold.  The technology sector dominates the index, and recent additions such as Coinbase Global and Block (founded by Jack\u202fDorsey) signal growing recognition of digital assets.  Melissa Roberts, managing director at Stephens, noted that \u2018If someone is a big player in the space, it\u2019s hard to ignore them.\u2019  Nonetheless, skepticism remains about the sustainability of Strategy\u2019s corporate\u2011treasury model, which raises capital through debt and equity to acquire Bitcoin.  Shares fell 17\u202f% in August, eroding the premium over Bitcoin holdings, and the 30\u2011day price volatility reached 96\u202f%, higher than that of Nvidia or Tesla, potentially raising red flags for the committee.  Although Strategy was included in the Nasdaq\u202f100 last December, the S&P\u202f500 is larger, with nearly $10\u202ftrillion tied to passive strategies.

No changes were made during the quarterly rebalancing in June, despite speculation that online brokerage Robinhood (HOOD) could be added. The S&P 500 is managed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which sets the criteria for inclusion. Key criteria include market value, with the most valuable companies accounting for the largest percentage of the index. Currently, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) account for roughly 20% of the S&P 500.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 01:37 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

    "summary": "All forecasting experts unanimously agree that Robinhood (HOOD) has been officially announced as being added to the S&P 500 before October 2025, with the effective inclusion date set for September 22, 2025. Each expert, drawing on specialized knowledge (index eligibility, IPOs, investment banking, market making, finance theory, economics, and business strategy), independently confirms this outcome based on multiple reputable news sources (including Bloomberg, Yahoo! Finance, Seeking Alpha, Benzinga, CoinDesk) reporting the official S&P Dow Jones Indices announcement. The fine print specifies that only the official announcement matters for resolution, not the actual effective date or any later retraction or reversal. Historical precedent indicates that such announcements are almost never reversed, and S&P 500 inclusion retractions post-announcement are virtually nonexistent. The only hypothetical 'No' scenarios would require all news sources to be wrong or the announcement to be retracted in an unprecedented fashion\u2014possibilities all experts dismiss as vanishingly unlikely with no evidence. All experts assign a probability of 99% or 100% for a 'Yes' resolution, citing the overwhelming corroboration of the official announcement, clear market reaction, and explicit resolution criteria. In summary: The probability that HOOD will be considered added to the S&P 500 before October 2025 is as close to certain as possible.",
