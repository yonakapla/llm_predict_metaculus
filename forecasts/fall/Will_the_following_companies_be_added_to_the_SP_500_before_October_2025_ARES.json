The absence of financial media buzz about imminent ARES inclusion, the lack of obvious new index vacancies among financials, and historic base rates showing slow cycling for large asset managers all combine to limit the likelihood sharply. With less than three weeks to the end of the window (and no news hinting at ARES as next in line), the probability that S&P announces ARES will join the S&P 500 before October 1, 2025, is low, though not zero. The original base rate for such late-window inclusions absent public signals or special events is under 10%.

The decision is a setback not only for Strategy but for the broader cohort of corporate crypto treasuries that use balance\u2011sheet bitcoin accumulation. The report points out that Strategy\u2019s inclusion in other major benchmarks\u2014such as the Nasdaq\u202f100 and MSCI indices\u2014has quietly given bitcoin a backdoor into retail and institutional portfolios. JPMorgan warns that the S&P\u202f500 decision could mark the limit of that trend and may prompt other index providers to rethink the inclusion of bitcoin\u2011heavy companies. Adding to the pressure, Nasdaq has reportedly begun requiring shareholder approval before companies can issue new stock to buy crypto. Strategy recently abandoned its no\u2011dilution pledge, indicating a willingness to issue shares at lower multiples to continue funding bitcoin purchases. Corporate crypto treasuries are facing weakening share prices and slowing issuance; equity and debt fundraising volumes declined last quarter, suggesting investor appetite is waning. The rising risk premium could push investors and index providers to favor crypto companies with operating businesses\u2014such as exchanges and miners\u2014over pure bitcoin\u2011holding vehicles. The report cites bitcoin\u2019s price at $108,783.53 and notes that the S&P\u202f500 decision could \"mark the limit of that trend\" and that \"the rising risk premium could push investors and index providers to favor crypto companies with operating businesses, like exchanges and miners, over pure bitcoin\u2011holding vehicles.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 11:58 AM\nSource:[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/11/strategy-s-s-and-p-500-snub-is-a-cautionary-signal-for-corporate-bitcoin-treasuries-jpmorgan)\n\n**S&P 500 Rejects Strategy Despite Meeting Eligibility Criteria, JPMorgan Reports**\nThe S&P\u202f500 index committee rejected Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) from the index last week, even though the company met all technical eligibility criteria. JPMorgan analysts, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, described the move as a \"blow to crypto treasuries\" and warned that it signals caution toward firms that function primarily as bitcoin funds. The decision affects not only Strategy but also other crypto\u2011treasury companies that have emerged recently. Strategy, the largest public crypto\u2011treasury firm, had previously been included in major benchmarks such as the Nasdaq\u202f100, MSCI\u202fUSA, MSCI\u202fWorld and the Russell\u202f2000, which had helped drive its stock performance. The rejection suggests that the indirect channel for bitcoin exposure through index inclusion may be \"reaching its limits,\" according to the JPMorgan report. The article notes that other index providers might reconsider adding similar firms after the S&P\u202f500\u2019s lead, potentially restricting their access to broader investment portfolios. Additional pressures include Nasdaq\u2019s new requirement for shareholder approval before issuing shares to fund crypto purchases, and a recent shift by Strategy away from a pledge to avoid issuing shares below a 2.5\u2011multiple. Market fatigue is evident in declining equity issuance volumes and slowing funding activity for crypto\u2011treasury firms, while debt issuance continues with higher risk premiums. JPMorgan analysts warn that skepticism toward bitcoin\u2011backed loans, token\u2011linked convertibles and other structured financing is growing, and that capital may shift toward crypto companies with operating businesses such as exchanges and miners. The S&P\u202f500 rejection reflects broader market concerns about companies whose primary business model revolves around holding cryptocurrency rather than traditional operations, and could reshape how crypto\u2011focused companies structure their balance sheets moving forward.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/sp-500-rejects-strategy-despite-meeting-eligibility-criteria-jpmorgan-reports/)\n\n**Part of the Club: Robinhood & AppLovin Soar on S&P 500 Inclusion**\nThe article reports that on September\u202f8, 2025, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:\u202fHOOD) and AppLovin (NASDAQ:\u202fAPP) were added to the S&P\u202f500 Index, a move that validates their business fundamentals and is expected to drive further share demand.  At the time of inclusion, Robinhood had a market capitalization of $33\u202fbillion and AppLovin $109\u202fbillion; about 25\u202f% of S&P\u202f500 constituents began 2025 with lower market caps, making the addition seem inevitable.  Shares reacted strongly: Robinhood closed up nearly 16\u202f% and AppLovin rose almost 12\u202f%.  Prior to the price action, both stocks had surged 496\u202f% and 520\u202f% over the previous 52\u202fweeks, respectively, but the article notes that such gains are not solely speculative.  S&P requires a positive GAAP net income over the last 12\u202fmonths; Robinhood has maintained positive GAAP net income for seven consecutive quarters, while AppLovin has done so for nine quarters, underscoring their profitability.  In contrast, Bitcoin\u2011buyer Strategy (NASDAQ:\u202fMSTR) \u2013 which also meets the market\u2011cap threshold of $22.7\u202fbillion \u2013 has shown positive GAAP net income only two of eight quarters, making it a less likely candidate for inclusion.  The article explains that passive funds such as BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core S&P\u202f500 ETF (NYSEARCA:\u202fIVV), which holds roughly $667\u202fbillion in net assets, will need to purchase the new constituents to track the index, creating additional buying pressure.  Active managers may also adjust their holdings toward the new index weights, further supporting demand.

The update adds AppLovin Corp. (APP), Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), and Emcor Group Inc. (EME) to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), and Enphase Energy (ENPH), which will move to smaller\u2011cap indexes. Bloomberg reports that Robinhood\u2019s inclusion marks a shift from a pandemic\u2011speculation platform to a mainstream brokerage that now manages billions in assets across stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. The article cites that HOOD stock has gained over 434% in the past year and that being added to the S&P 500 automatically places the company into index funds, pensions, and retirement accounts worldwide, thereby expanding its institutional footprint. Other changes include Uber Technologies (UBER) joining the S&P 100, replacing Charter Communications (CHTR); MP Materials (MP) and Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS) moving into the S&P MidCap 400; and several firms\u2014Wendy\u2019s (WEN), MarketAxess, Caesars, Enphase, Acadia Healthcare (ACHC), and ManpowerGroup (MAN)\u2014transitioning to the S&P SmallCap 600. The reshuffle is expected to trigger significant stock moves as passive investors adjust portfolios.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 04:24 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/25/09/47537068/robinhood-enters-sp-500-marking-retail-tradings-shift-to-wall-street-core)\n\n**S&P 500 Adds AppLovin, Robinhood, Emcor, Excludes MicroStrategy**\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported that the S&P Dow Jones Indices will add AppLovin (APP), Robinhood (HOOD) and EMCOR Group (EME) to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings (MXX), Caesars Entertainment (CZR) and Enphase Energy (ENPH). The additions will take effect on September 22, 2025. Seyffart also noted that MicroStrategy (MSTR) was not included in this round of additions, a decision attributed to the discretion of the S&P 500 committee. Balchunas explained, 'Why wasn\u2019t $MSTR allowed into the S&P 500 Index despite meeting all the criteria? Because the Committee said no.' The move highlights that meeting eligibility criteria does not guarantee inclusion. The quarterly rebalancing aims to keep the index representative of market capitalization and sector balance among large\u2011cap U.S. equities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 01:59 PM\nSource:[cryptotimes.io](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/09/06/s-and-p-500-adds-applovin-robinhood-emcor-excludes-microstrategy/)\n\n**S&P 500 Potential: Strategy Could See $16 Billion Inflows With Index Inclusion-Bloomberg | Bitcoinist.com**\nStrategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has become a major Bitcoin holder, generating a $14\u202fbillion unrealized gain in the last quarter, which Bloomberg reports satisfies the profitability requirement for S&P\u202f500 inclusion.  If the company were accepted, passive index\u2011tracking funds would need to purchase roughly 50\u202fmillion shares, creating an estimated $16\u202fbillion inflow at current market prices.  The S&P\u202f500 committee evaluates liquidity, profitability, trading history, and sector balance; it requires a minimum market capitalization of $22.7\u202fbillion and positive income for the current and past four quarters.  Strategy\u2019s market cap exceeds $90\u202fbillion, comfortably above the threshold.  The technology sector dominates the index, and recent additions such as Coinbase Global and Block (founded by Jack\u202fDorsey) signal growing recognition of digital assets.  Melissa Roberts, managing director at Stephens, noted that \u2018If someone is a big player in the space, it\u2019s hard to ignore them.\u2019  Nonetheless, skepticism remains about the sustainability of Strategy\u2019s corporate\u2011treasury model, which raises capital through debt and equity to acquire Bitcoin.  Shares fell 17\u202f% in August, eroding the premium over Bitcoin holdings, and the 30\u2011day price volatility reached 96\u202f%, higher than that of Nvidia or Tesla, potentially raising red flags for the committee.  Although Strategy was included in the Nasdaq\u202f100 last December, the S&P\u202f500 is larger, with nearly $10\u202ftrillion tied to passive strategies.  Saylor has suggested that 2025 could be a pivotal year for inclusion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 05:10 PM\nSource:[Bitcoinist.com](https://bitcoinist.com/sp-500-potential-strategy-could-16-billion-inflows/)\n\n**Strategy now meets all S&P 500 requirements after a $14 billion unrealized gain last quarte**\nStrategy Inc., a former enterprise software firm turned corporate Bitcoin vault, has met all technical criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500 after reporting an unrealized gain of $14\u202fbillion last quarter, according to Bloomberg. The company\u2019s market cap of $90\u202fbillion, liquidity of nearly $70\u202fbillion in Bitcoin, and positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the past four quarters satisfy the index\u2019s requirements of U.S. domicile, a market cap of at least $22.7\u202fbillion, and profitability. Among 26 candidates, Strategy topped the float\u2011adjusted liquidity ratio, a key metric for inclusion. Melissa Roberts, head of index rebalancing research at Stephens, told Bloomberg, 'They care about building representation of leading companies in the 500. So, if someone is a big player in the space, it\u2019s hard to ignore them.' The S&P committee, however, retains discretion, citing concerns over sector balance and the company\u2019s 30\u2011day price volatility of 96\u202f%, higher than Nvidia\u2019s 77\u202f% and Tesla\u2019s 74\u202f%. A failed preferred\u2011stock sale earlier this year forced Strategy to issue common stock, causing the share price to fall 17\u202f% in August. Despite these risks, passive index funds would need to buy roughly 50\u202fmillion shares\u2014about $16\u202fbillion at current prices\u2014if the company is added, turning institutional investors into indirect Bitcoin holders overnight. Research by Antti Petajisto shows that new S&P 500 entrants typically rally on inclusion, an effect that has slowed but still exists. Edward Yoon of Macquarie Capital warned that meeting eligibility does not guarantee inclusion, noting that the committee\u2019s discretion and sector\u2011weighting rules remain decisive. Saylor has said 2025 could be the year Strategy joins the index, and the numbers now support that possibility.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/strategy-checks-every-box-sp-500-inclusion/)\n\n**MicroStrategy Qualifies for S&P\u202f500, Inclusion Decision Awaiting Friday**\nMicroStrategy (ticker MSTR), now trading under the name Strategy, has officially qualified for potential inclusion in the S&P\u202f500 after reporting its strongest quarterly performance ever.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts\u2014representing domains such as index methodology, equity research, finance, accounting, and strategic management\u2014converge on a low probability (11%) that Ares Management Corporation (ARES) will be announced for addition to the S&P 500 before October 1, 2025. While ARES easily meets the technical criteria for inclusion (market capitalization, profitability, U.S. listing, public float, and robust business model), forecasters repeatedly emphasize that the S&P 500 committee applies significant discretionary judgment when selecting new constituents. Historical precedent\u2014including the recent rejection of other technically qualified companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR)\u2014illustrates that eligibility alone does not guarantee inclusion. \n\nAll experts note that the latest index rebalance in September 2025 saw the addition of other companies (Robinhood, AppLovin, Emcor) without ARES being mentioned, and neither market signals nor financial media speculation indicate imminent action for ARES. The base rate for out-of-cycle, late-window additions is extremely low, as scheduled quarterly rebalances are the typical window for changes. While ARES is fundamentally a strong and stable asset manager with sector representation arguments in its favor, there is no urgent catalyst, sectoral gap, or imminent constituent removal that would prioritize its inclusion. Discretionary committee factors\u2014sector balancing, business model appropriateness, and index stability\u2014further lower the near-term odds. Each expert outlines scenarios where an unscheduled event (like a constituent\u2019s sudden removal) could prompt a last-minute addition, but collectively see these as remote. Summing up, all expert perspectives align that the announcement of ARES\u2019s S&P 500 inclusion before October 2025 is quite unlikely; all assign an 11% probability, slightly above zero to allow for unforeseen events but reflecting historical patterns and current signals.",
