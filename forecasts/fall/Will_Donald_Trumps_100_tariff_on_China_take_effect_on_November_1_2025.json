Trump\u2019s messaging in the immediate aftermath already signals room for flexibility. The timing of the looming APEC summit, combined with the practical and legal obstacles to implementing an all-encompassing 100% tariff (including procedural delays, administrative preparedness, and intra-industry backlash), make literal, immediate implementation unlikely. Most comparable actions in the Trump era saw delay, dilution, or were restricted to narrower product lists after negotiation. The domestic and international stakes (market, allies, WTO) further militate against immediate follow-through. Given all this, the base rate for full implementation of a maximalist threat is well below 50%, even in moments of acute escalation. My expertise suggests that, as of November 1, it is more likely than not that some dilution, delay, or technical workaround denies the question a 'Yes' resolution, though a non-trivial risk of implementation remains due to the high volatility and strategic escalation.",

Congressional Republicans are less likely to block the action outright, but broader business, market, and global macro pressures are intense, as reflected by the market sell-off and warnings by trade experts in the news. The proximity of the APEC summit and Trump's own more conciliatory remarks on October 12 ('don\u2019t worry, everything will be fine') reinforce the pattern of maximalist threat as negotiation bait. China also faces economic and strategic costs, giving both sides incentive to negotiate up to the 11th hour.

The market reaction and rapid 'don't worry, everything will be fine' messaging signal a high likelihood the November 1 deadline is a negotiation tool, not a likely endpoint.

Recent threats for even higher tariffs (200%) were not carried out. The timing of the APEC summit literally one day before the deadline maximizes the space for a last-minute handshake, kick-the-can delay, or 'negotiations ongoing' announcement. Political and economic blowback in the U.S., especially with market reactions signaling recession risk, makes it even less appealing for Trump to actually impose a mutually damaging 100% tariff, absent an irrecoverable breakdown. However, because the question resolves as \"Yes\" if any new 100%+ tariff is implemented (even on a restricted good), there is some risk Trump may apply it narrowly to 'critical technologies,' enabling a partial face-saving measure. Balancing all these factors, and given the overwhelming historical evidence toward de-escalation and delay, I put the probability modestly above a pure base rate of 'very high tariff threat follow-through' (~10\u201315%), but below 1-in-4, given the high bar for a broad new 100% tariff.

Empirical evidence from the first Trump administration (2018\u20132020) shows almost all extreme tariff threats were relaxed or negotiated just before the deadline, with several announcements serving as tools to maximize leverage before de-escalation. Chinese restrictions on rare earths are a serious escalation, but Beijing also seeks reciprocal face-saving offramps: both authoritarian governments are highly incentive-aligned on avoiding a major disruption to their economies, especially with global supply chains at stake and both facing complex domestic conditions. The proximity of the APEC summit (with Xi-Trump meeting still officially on the books), the clear use of tariff announcements as bargaining chips (including Trump's reversal posts), and the overwhelming market backlash make unconditional imposition of 100% tariffs highly unlikely without some further warning or failed negotiation. The most probable path is a high-stakes, last-minute negotiation leading to a postponement (even if only for a few weeks or months). Historical frequency of walkback on extreme Trump tariff threats\u2014especially in periods of acute market panic and pending leadership summits\u2014suggests probability much lower than 50% for implementation exactly as threatened, barring a total diplomatic breakdown. I estimate the chances that any 100% tariff is actually in effect on November 1, 2025\u2014per credible trackers\u2014at about 18%.

Across the board, forecasters recognize that base rates for 'follow-through' on extreme headline tariff threats are low, even when diplomatic settings are tense. I also note a consistent consensus that, unless talks completely collapse or an unpredictable sequence of escalations unfolds, the odds of a 100% tariff taking effect as stated are tightly bounded in the \u2018unlikely but not impossible\u2019 range. No new arguments have shifted my assessment upward; if anything, the group discussion reveals some slight over-estimation by others who still assign probabilities in the high 20s to low 30s\u2014something historic precedent doesn\u2019t justify. The balance of probabilities remains firmly on walk-back/delay, so I will not revise my initial probability.",

This announcement triggered a sharp sell-off in U.S. markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 800 points on October 10. Trump also considered canceling his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea. China responded by issuing two new export control regulations targeting rare earth-related materials and technologies, asserting these measures are necessary for national security, similar to U.S. restrictions on chips and semiconductors. China accounts for approximately 70% of global rare earth mining and over 90% of global rare earth processing capacity. Despite the initial hardline stance, Trump reversed course on October 12, posting on Truth Social that 'don\u2019t worry, everything will be fine,' suggesting the tariff threat may be negotiable. U.S. media outlet Axios analyzed that China\u2019s new controls aim to gain leverage in trade negotiations, and if enforced, could severely impact the U.S. economy due to its lack of alternative rare earth sources, threatening sectors like semiconductors and defense.

Additionally, the U.S. will implement export restrictions on all critical software. This announcement triggered a market sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 800 points on October 10. Trump also indicated he might cancel his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. China's Ministry of Commerce had issued two announcements on October 9, 2025, restricting exports of rare earth-related materials and technologies, including those containing Chinese components, citing national security concerns. China produces approximately 70% of the world\u2019s rare earth mining output and controls over 90% of global rare earth processing capacity. China accused the U.S. of hypocrisy, noting that the U.S. also imposes export controls on chips and semiconductors. However, on October 12, Trump posted on Truth Social stating that there was no need to worry about China, and that Xi Jinping would not allow his country to fall into economic depression, prompting a rebound in U.S. stock futures and cryptocurrency prices. According to Axios analysis, China\u2019s new rare earth controls aim to gain leverage in trade negotiations. If fully implemented, they could severely impact the U.S. economy, as the U.S. currently lacks alternative sources for Chinese rare earth minerals, potentially disrupting semiconductor and defense industries. The Trump administration is actively working to strengthen domestic supply chains for critical minerals, having recently invested in MP Materials (MP.US), Lithium Americas (LAC.US), and quietly engaging with USA Rare Earth (USAR.US).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 11:21 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=3ab351d2-5004-4ed7-b219-555c631cc261)\n\n**Trump puts extra 100% tariff on Chinese imports - Taipei Times**\nOn October 12, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports, effective November 1, in response to China's export controls on rare earth minerals. The move, which also includes U.S. export restrictions on 'any and all critical software,' was framed by Trump as retaliation for what he described as Beijing\u2019s 'extraordinarily aggressive' actions. He claimed China\u2019s control over rare earth elements\u2014essential for smartphones, electric vehicles, military equipment, and renewable energy technology\u2014constitutes a 'hostile' strategy that allows China to 'hold the World captive.' Trump threatened to cancel a planned summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, stating, 'I was to meet President Xi in two weeks... but now there seems to be no reason to do so.' However, he later clarified to reporters in the Oval Office that he had not canceled the meeting, saying, 'I haven\u2019t canceled, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to have it, but I\u2019m going to be there regardless.' The announcement triggered a market reaction, with the NASDAQ falling 3.6% and the S&P 500 dropping 2.7%. Current U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods stand at 30% due to alleged Chinese support for the fentanyl trade and unfair trade practices, while China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs are at 10%. Trump\u2019s announcement followed a lengthy post on Truth Social where he claimed China had sent letters to countries worldwide about the rare earth export controls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[taipeitimes.com](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/10/12/2003845330)\n\n**Trump threatens tech export limits, new 100 per cent tariff on Chinese imports starting Nov. 1 or sooner**\nU.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, or sooner, in response to China's new export controls on rare earth elements and related technologies. The restrictions, announced by China on October 10, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain special approval for exporting rare earths and prohibit exports of products used in military goods. Trump described the move as 'shocking' and 'out of the blue,' claiming China is 'becoming very hostile' and holding the world 'captive' by restricting access to critical materials used in electronics, chips, lasers, and jet engines. He also stated that the U.S. would impose export controls on 'any and all critical software' from American firms. While Trump did not formally cancel a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a trip to South Korea, he expressed uncertainty about whether it would occur, saying, 'I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to have it.' The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% on the news, marking its worst day since April 2025, when similar tariff threats sparked fears of a global recession. Analysts note that Trump has a history of making high-stakes threats that he later withdraws, a pattern investors have dubbed the 'TACO' trade ('Trump Always Chickens Out'). Experts such as Sun Yun of the Stimson Center and Gracelin Baskaran of CSIS emphasize that while China\u2019s actions are disproportionate, there is still room for de-escalation and mutual negotiation. China controls 70% of global rare earth mining and 93% of permanent magnet production, giving it significant leverage. Craig Singleton of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies warned that Trump\u2019s post could end the recent tariff truce between the two nations, leading to 'mutually assured disruption.' The U.S. and China are also locked in broader trade tensions involving chip exports, soybean sales, and reciprocal port fees, with the situation remaining volatile as both sides prepare for high-stakes economic negotiations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 12:05 AM\nSource:[bnnbloomberg.ca](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tariffs/2025/10/10/trump-says-there-seems-to-be-no-reason-to-meet-xi-during-upcoming-asia-trip/)\n\n**Trump threatens to jack up tariffs on China over its new rare-earth controls**\nOn October 10, 2025, former President Donald Trump threatened to significantly increase U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in response to China's new export controls on rare-earth elements\u2014critical minerals used in semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries, jet engines, and defense weapons. The move, which took effect this week, lacks specified penalties in its English translation but was described by Trump as 'very hostile.' He announced that a 'massive increase of Tariffs' on Chinese imports is under consideration, along with other countermeasures. Trump also threatened to cancel a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later that month. Financial markets reacted negatively: the S&P 500 dropped 131 points (nearly 2%) to 6,664, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 624 points (1.3%), and the Nasdaq Composite declined nearly 600 points (2.6%). Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush attributed the sell-off to renewed trade tensions, calling the escalation a 'white-knuckle moment' for markets, especially for tech stocks, amid broader concerns about a potential bubble in AI-driven equities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 04:37 PM\nSource:[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-china-tariffs-rare-earth-elements/)\n\n**[Editorial] Ever-present risk**\nTensions in the US-China trade war have escalated after China announced export restrictions on rare earths on October 10, 2025. In response, former U.S. President Donald Trump declared he would impose an additional 100 percent tariff on all imports from China, effective November 1, raising total U.S. tariffs on China to 130 percent\u2014nearing the 145 percent rate previously imposed in April 2025 before a temporary truce. This new tariff effectively bans most Chinese exports to the U.S. Trump also announced export controls on critical software. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce stated it does not want a trade war but warned it would 'resolutely take corresponding measures' if the U.S. continues its current course. Trump indicated there is 'no reason' to proceed with a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. The renewed conflict has triggered global financial instability, with stock markets plunging in New York and Europe, raising fears of simultaneous recession and high inflation. South Korea is especially vulnerable: it depends on China for over 80 percent of its rare earth imports, which are vital for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and defense industries. China\u2019s new export controls extend to products containing more than 0.1 percent of domestically sourced rare earths or manufactured using Chinese technology. The additional U.S. tariff will shrink global trade and severely impact South Korea\u2019s export-driven economy. The Korean won has already strengthened to 1,430 per dollar, increasing financial market volatility. The Korean government is urged to stabilize foreign exchange markets, pursue currency swap agreements with the U.S., and accelerate efforts to secure alternative rare earth suppliers and develop overseas resources. While both Trump and Xi have not yet withdrawn from the APEC summit, a last-minute breakthrough remains possible\u2014but even a deal would not guarantee an end to the broader trade conflict. The Korea Herald warns that the risk of being caught in a sudden trade war between the two superpowers remains ever-present, necessitating long-term strategic planning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 08:56 PM\nSource:[The Korea Herald](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10592436)\n\n**Trump Threatens Massive Tariffs on China Over Rare Earth Minerals Export Controls**\nDonald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he is canceling his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, citing China's increasingly hostile stance. The move follows China's recent efforts to assert control over the export of rare earth minerals\u2014critical for electronics and electric vehicles\u2014by signaling potential restrictions on these materials and other products. In response, Trump declared plans to impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, effective November 1, 2025, alongside new export controls on critical software. This escalation reflects growing U.S.-China tensions over rare earth exports, which analysts say China now views as a powerful strategic lever. Ilaria Mazzocco of the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that China appears more confident in using these controls as a geopolitical tool, possibly marking a shift from the first Trump administration. Financial markets reacted sharply: the Dow Jones fell 1.9%, the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, and the Nasdaq declined 3.6%. Experts like Rush Doshi of the Council on Foreign Relations suggest further measures\u2014such as financial sanctions, semiconductor export controls, or an expanded 'transshipment' tariff\u2014could follow. Despite a 30% drop in U.S. imports from China this year, China remains the fourth-largest source of U.S. imports, indicating significant ongoing economic exposure.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 10:33 AM\nSource:[Bolsamania](https://www.bolsamania.com/capitalbolsa/noticias/economia/trump-sugiere-un-aumento-masivo-de-aranceles-a-china-esto-es-lo-que-hay-detras-de-la-amenaza--21029916.html)\n\n**Rare Earth Tensions: Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs on China, But Signals Possible Diplomatic Breathing Room**\nU.S. President Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, citing China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, and announced plans to restrict exports of critical software.

This follows China's recent imposition of stricter export controls on rare earth materials, which the U.S. views as economic retaliation. Trump also declared that the U.S. will tighten export controls on key software and add Boeing aircraft parts to the restricted list. He suggested that his scheduled summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2014planned for October 31 and November 1 during the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea\u2014could be canceled unless Beijing lifts its rare earth export restrictions and resumes purchasing U.S. agricultural products like soybeans. Trump labeled China\u2019s rare earth controls as 'unprecedented in international trade' and posted about the move on Truth Social. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce responded by stating that threatening others with excessive tariffs is not a path to coexistence and warned of firm countermeasures if the U.S. proceeds. Analysts interpret the escalation as part of a broader geopolitical power play ahead of the APEC summit and the November 10 expiration of a temporary tariff suspension. Despite earlier threats to cancel the meeting, Trump later told reporters that a summit could still occur, leaving room for negotiation. The U.S. currently levies a combined 55 percent tariff on Chinese goods, including a 20 percent duty related to fentanyl concerns, a 10 percent global tariff since April, and a 25 percent tariff under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 10:57 PM\nSource:[www.donga.com](https://www.donga.com/en/article/all/20251013/5896804/1)\n\n**Trump Says U.S. Will Hit China With 100% Additional Tariff Over Rare Earth Restrictions**\nOn October 12, 2025, former President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports and new export controls on critical software, effective November 1, 2025, in response to China\u2019s new export restrictions on rare earth elements, lithium batteries, and related technologies. The Chinese measures, which require foreign entities to obtain licenses for products containing as little as 0.1% Chinese rare earths or manufactured using Chinese processing technology, are set to take effect in early November. China processes approximately 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths, which are essential for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and military equipment, giving Beijing significant leverage over global supply chains. Trump stated that the move was a surprise given the previously stable U.S.-China relationship over the past six months and claimed other countries had expressed anger over China\u2019s actions. He also canceled a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, citing China\u2019s aggressive stance. The new U.S. tariffs could raise the average U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods above 150%. The dispute follows earlier tensions in April 2025, when China tightened rare earth exports, prompting supply chain concerns. A previous tariff truce had reduced U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from over 140% to an average of 57.6%, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods average 32.6%. The latest restrictions may be more disruptive, as many global tech firms may struggle to prove their products fall below the 0.1% threshold, requiring Chinese government approval for exports. Trump\u2019s announcement reflects U.S. leverage in advanced semiconductor technology and equipment, with American and allied companies controlling over 90% of global semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The federal government shutdown in the U.S. may have emboldened China, which interpreted it as a sign of domestic instability. Trump\u2019s response suggests China miscalculated his willingness to act decisively.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 01:15 PM\nSource:[breitbart.com](https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/10/10/trump-says-u-s-will-hit-china-with-100-additional-tariff-over-rare-earth-restrictions/)\n\n**Trump puts extra 100% tariff on Chinese imports - Taipei Times**\nOn October 12, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports, effective November 1, in response to China's export controls on rare earth minerals. The move, which also includes U.S. export restrictions on 'any and all critical software,' was framed by Trump as retaliation for what he described as Beijing\u2019s 'extraordinarily aggressive' actions. He claimed China\u2019s control over rare earth elements\u2014essential for smartphones, electric vehicles, military equipment, and renewable energy technology\u2014constitutes a 'hostile' strategy that allows China to 'hold the World captive.' Trump threatened to cancel a planned summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, stating, 'I was to meet President Xi in two weeks... but now there seems to be no reason to do so.' However, he later clarified to reporters in the Oval Office that he had not canceled the meeting, saying, 'I haven\u2019t canceled, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to have it, but I\u2019m going to be there regardless.' The announcement triggered a market reaction, with the NASDAQ falling 3.6% and the S&P 500 dropping 2.7%. Current U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods stand at 30% due to alleged Chinese support for the fentanyl trade and unfair trade practices, while China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs are at 10%. Trump\u2019s announcement followed a lengthy post on Truth Social where he claimed China had sent letters to countries worldwide about the rare earth export controls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[taipeitimes.com](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/10/12/2003845330)\n\n**Trump threatens 100 per cent tariff on Chinese imports**\nPresident Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, or sooner, in response to China\u2019s new export restrictions on rare earth elements and related technologies.

Trump described the move as 'shocking' and 'out of the blue,' accusing China of becoming 'very hostile' and holding the world 'captive' by controlling critical materials used in electronics, chips, jet engines, and defense systems. He stated the U.S. would also impose export controls on critical American software. Although Trump did not formally cancel a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a trip to South Korea, he expressed uncertainty about whether it would occur. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% on market fears, its worst day since April, reflecting concerns over renewed trade tensions. Analysts note that while Trump is known for making high-stakes threats, he often backs down\u2014leading to the 'TACO' trade (Trump Always Chickens Out).

The EU Chamber of Commerce in China warned the new controls add 'further complexity' to the global supply chain. Other flashpoints include U.S. restrictions on advanced chip exports, soybean sales, and tit-for-tat port fees.

This new tariff adds to the existing 30% tariff, raising the total effective tariff rate to approximately 130%. The move follows China's recent restrictions on the export of 12 out of 17 rare earth metals\u2014critical for high-tech manufacturing such as semiconductors, electric vehicles, and defense systems\u2014by tightening licensing requirements for foreign companies using Chinese technologies or materials. Trump labeled China\u2019s actions as 'morally reprehensible' and 'hostile,' and threatened to cancel his scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, stating, 'It was planned to meet President Xi in two weeks at APEC, but now there is no reason to meet.' Financial markets reacted sharply: the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 878 points (1.9%), the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, and the Nasdaq declined 3.6%, with major technology stocks like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Tesla, and Qualcomm suffering significant losses. This escalation follows a period of relative trade d\u00e9tente after years of high tariffs under Trump\u2019s administration, raising global concerns about renewed trade warfare disrupting global supply chains and increasing economic uncertainty. The U.S. administration also described China\u2019s policies as 'hostile' and 'dangerous' to global trade, and Trump threatened to impose export controls on sensitive U.S.-developed software used by China. The developments signal November 2025 as a pivotal month for U.S.-China trade relations.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 09:21 AM\nSource:[annahar.com](https://www.annahar.com/Economy/249874/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A9-100-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-1-%D9%86%D9%88%D9%81%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B1)\n\n**Trump Imposes 100% Tariffs in Response to China's Rare Earth Export Controls: A Renewed Trade Conflict**\nIn response to China's new export controls on rare earth materials, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on October 11, 2025, the imposition of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, effective November 1, 2025, and new export restrictions on 'critical software.' This move reignited trade tensions between the U.S. and China after months of relative calm. The announcement followed China's October 9 decree restricting exports of rare earth materials, related technologies, and products involving AI, logic chips, and memory chips, requiring approval for any product containing 0.1% or more of Chinese-sourced rare earths. The new rules also restrict exports to companies linked with foreign militaries and impose new limitations on equipment for electric vehicle batteries. China produces about 70% of the world\u2019s rare earth, and 90% of global rare earth refining is done in China, making the new controls a major concern for global supply chains. U.S. tech stocks suffered significantly, with Nvidia dropping nearly 5%, AMD falling nearly 8%, and the broader semiconductor sector declining over 5%. The announcement triggered a sharp market reaction: the Dow Jones fell nearly 900 points, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, its worst single-day decline since April. Trump initially threatened to cancel a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, but later indicated the tariff could be withdrawn before November 1 and that the meeting was not necessarily off. The U.S. government, particularly Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, expressed outrage, with some officials calling for a 'reset' of negotiations. Analysts suggest China may have implemented the controls to strengthen its bargaining position ahead of the Xi-Trump meeting, but experts like Stimson Center\u2019s Sun Yun and former USCBC Chairman Craig Allen believe both sides are overconfident, making compromise difficult. However, Quincy Institute\u2019s Jake Werner noted that Trump has previously threatened to 'destroy' U.S.-China relations but always returned to talks, as both nations recognize the mutual damage they can inflict. The crisis remains containable, with the U.S. tariff deadline set for November 1 and China\u2019s export control deadline for December 1, leaving a window for diplomatic resolution.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/124373/9063534)\n\n**Trump threatens tech export limits, new 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting Nov 1 or sooner**\nOn October 11, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he would impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, or sooner, citing China\u2019s recent export controls on rare earth elements as justification.

The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[breakingnews.ie](https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/trump-threatens-new-100-tariff-on-chinese-imports-from-november-1-or-sooner-1817838.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a broad panel of experts\u2014spanning international trade law, U.S. government policy, political science, economics, and China studies\u2014there is consensus that the probability of Donald Trump's announced 100% tariff on Chinese imports actually taking effect on November 1, 2025, is well below 50%. Most forecasts cluster between 15% and 32%. All experts emphasize the history of similar maximalist threats by Trump being used mainly as negotiating leverage, only to be delayed, weakened, or substituted for narrower measures following market turmoil, lobbying pressure, or diplomatic engagement. The much-discussed 'TACO' (Trump Always Chickens Out) pattern recurs as a key historical analogy, further reinforced by last-minute high-profile meetings such as the scheduled Trump-Xi summit at APEC on October 31, which provides an optimal window for face-saving de-escalation. Significant negative market reactions, pushback from powerful business and trade sectors, and institutional legal/bureaucratic hurdles are all cited as major forces decreasing the chance of rapid, blanket implementation. While the escalation by China via rare earth export controls is acknowledged as a strong bargaining move that increases the underlying pressure for retaliation, most analysts judge that both sides have incentives to avoid mutually assured economic harm. Some minor risk is noted that a limited 100% tariff could be applied on a small subset of goods as a face-saving gesture, thereby technically resolving the question as 'Yes', but even these scenarios are seen as unlikely based on recent precedent. Overall, the collective reasoning leads to a modest (roughly 15\u201332%) probability for a definitive 100% tariff being in effect on November 1, 2025, principally dependent on the outcome of last-ditch diplomatic talks or a critical breakdown thereof.",
