Kosovo is blocked by Russia/China, with no evidence of imminent change. No other candidate state exists with feasible prospects and the necessary Security Council consensus.

The window (2 months) is too short for a negotiated breakthrough, especially amid ongoing war in Gaza and hardening P5 positions. Thus, the probability of the number of UN member states exceeding 193 before January 1, 2026, is very low\u2014though not strictly zero, given extraordinary global pressure and diplomatic maneuvering.",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAs of July 2024, the United Nations has 193 member states. This question asks whether that number will increase before the start of 2026.\n\nJoining the UN requires a recommendation from the Security Council and a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly. The process of admitting new members to the UN is generally slow and deliberate, reflecting the organization's role in recognizing sovereign states on the global stage.\n\nPotential candidates for UN membership include:\n\n1. Palestine: Currently a non-member observer state.\n2. Kosovo: Partially recognized, but not a UN member.\n3. Taiwan: Though it functions as an independent state, its UN membership is complicated by China's position.\n4. South Ossetia and Abkhazia: Breakaway regions from Georgia with limited recognition.\n5. Northern Cyprus: Only recognized by Turkey.\n\nAdditionally, new states could potentially emerge through independence movements or the dissolution of existing states.\n\nFactors to consider when forecasting:\n\n- Historical rate of UN membership growth (e.g., the last new member, South Sudan, joined in 2011)\n- Current geopolitical tensions and conflicts\n- Ongoing independence movements\n- Diplomatic efforts of aspiring member states\n- The veto power of permanent Security Council members\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":26884,\"question_id\":26884}}`",

The article emphasizes the urgent need to rebuild international cooperation to achieve peace and stability. While the UN made significant achievements in the past decade\u2014such as adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal\u2014recent events have undermined its credibility. Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza, which the UN Human Rights Council\u2019s independent investigative committee has labeled as potential genocide, highlight the failure of global consensus. The Trump administration\u2019s 'America First' policy led to the U.S. withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council and WHO, and abandoning the Iran nuclear deal. The UN\u2019s effectiveness has also been hampered by structural flaws, particularly in the Security Council, where permanent members (the U.S., Russia, China, the UK, and France) retain veto power despite the expansion of membership from 51 to 193 countries. The Council has repeatedly failed to act during crises in Ukraine and Gaza due to vetoes by the U.S. and Russia. The article notes that despite the UN\u2019s historical successes\u2014such as mediating the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and leading the eradication of smallpox\u2014its relevance is now questioned. The UN\u2019s operational reforms, such as the 'UN80 Initiative' launched by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in March 2025 to improve efficiency and cut costs, are necessary but must not compromise the organization\u2019s core functions. Japan, a founding member since 1956, has long viewed the UN as a cornerstone of its foreign policy, contributing financially (reaching about 20% of total funding by 2000) and sending prominent figures like Sadako Ogata as High Commissioner for Refugees. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba questioned in September 2025 whether the current UN fulfills its original purpose. The article concludes that in an increasingly divided world, the UN must reassert its role as a bridge between nations, and countries like Japan must uphold their responsibility in doing so.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20251023/ddm/005/070/105000c)\n\n**Progressive Global Alliance Unanimously Adopts Resolution for Ceasefire, Palestinian Statehood, and Reconstruction of Gaza**\nThe Progressive Global Alliance's 40-member council, representing various geopolitical regions worldwide, unanimously adopted a resolution on September 21, 2025, calling for an immediate end to the destruction in Gaza, the termination of the Israeli occupation, humanitarian aid and reconstruction of Gaza, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state through peaceful means along the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. In a video conference statement from Ramallah, Arab world representative Muhammad Ashti highlighted the devastation, killing, and famine in Gaza, as well as the ongoing siege, Judaization, and incursions in the West Bank, including Jerusalem. The council reaffirmed its commitment to a peaceful, just resolution based on the principles adopted by the alliance in Santiago, Chile, on October 6, 2024. It demanded an immediate ceasefire, protection of civilians, unimpeded humanitarian aid, reconstruction of Gaza, and rejection of forced displacement. The resolution emphasized adherence to international law, the two-state solution along the 1967 borders, and the need for international pressure, including economic and trade measures, on Israel until compliance with international law is achieved. The council also called for full implementation of International Court of Justice (ICJ) provisional measures (January 26, 2024) in the South Africa vs. Israel case on the prevention of genocide, the unconditional release of hostages, and compliance with international humanitarian law. Additionally, it urged the enforcement of ICC arrest warrants, implementation of UN General Assembly Resolution 194 on the right of return, and condemnation of efforts to block Palestinian representation at the UN, including U.S. actions restricting President Mahmoud Abbas and his delegation. The council expressed support for international recognition of Palestine within the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital, full UN membership for Palestine, and the implementation of the New York Declaration on the peaceful settlement of the Palestinian issue and the two-state solution.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[fatehwatan.ps](https://fatehwatan.ps/page-196626.html)\n\n**The United Nations at a Crossroads: Between the Legitimacy of the Past and the Reality of a New World Order**\nThe United Nations, marking its global day amid rising global conflicts and instability, is once again under scrutiny as a central institution for international peace, cooperation, and humanitarian action. Since its founding in 1945, the UN has grown from 51 to 193 member states, becoming the sole globally recognized platform with universal legitimacy. It has shaped a comprehensive legal framework across political, economic, social, and human rights domains, serving as a key international reference. The UN has played a vital role beyond humanitarian aid\u2014promoting peace, deploying peacekeeping missions, responding to natural disasters, and fostering dialogue among peoples. Its initiatives have offered hope to millions affected by war, famine, and crises. However, the organization has faced significant failures, particularly in balancing international power dynamics, most notably in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where repeated use of the veto by permanent Security Council members has undermined its effectiveness and credibility. Despite this, the UN has achieved notable successes, including resolutions affirming Palestinian statehood based on pre-1967 borders and mediating peace in multiple regional conflicts. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is highlighted as a model of responsible engagement, consistently upholding international legitimacy, actively supporting UN programs, and ranking among the largest donors to humanitarian efforts. The UN maintains strong ties with major regional bodies, particularly the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which shares its goals in promoting global peace, combating terrorism and extremism, advancing intercultural dialogue, fighting Islamophobia, and protecting human rights. While criticisms persist regarding the UN\u2019s limited influence and declining ability to enforce stability, the article argues that abandoning or sidelining the organization is not viable. Instead, reform is essential\u2014modernizing its structures to enhance fairness, transparency, and representation of global public will, rather than being constrained by great power interests. A call by the Saudi Cabinet on October 1, 2024, underscores this urgency, advocating for Security Council reform to restore credibility and responsiveness amid escalating global crises and declining trust in the international system. The UN now stands at a critical crossroads: either reclaim its historical role as a platform for international justice, or cede ground to power politics and narrow interests. The world urgently needs a new international order rooted in balance, equity, and a UN that truly reflects the conscience of humanity and can meet future challenges.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 09:04 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646](https://www.alwatan.com.sa/article/1171754)\n\n**UK Urges UN Members to Recognize Kosovo for Long-Term Stability**\nThe United Kingdom urged United Nations member states that have not yet recognized Kosovo's independence to join the majority that have done so, emphasizing that recognition is essential for long-term stability and enabling Kosovo to fully realize its potential. Jennifer McNaughtan, the UK\u2019s senior adviser at the UN mission, stated during a Security Council meeting on Kosovo that the UK remains a 'firm supporter of Kosovo\u2019s democratic path and its journey toward integration into European and Atlantic institutions.' She welcomed the smooth conduct of recent local elections and the return of Serbian minority mayors to their positions in northern Kosovo, calling it 'a positive step toward a fully representative local government.' However, she expressed concern over statements threatening to undermine core state institutions, including the Constitutional Court. The UK reiterated its call for Serbia to reduce tensions and hold accountable those responsible for the 2023 Banjska attack, including Milan Radovi\u0107, noting that 'accountability for this attack and attacks on KFOR forces has been delayed too long.' The UK also urged both Kosovo and Serbia to resolve their disputes through EU-mediated dialogue, fully implement agreed commitments\u2014such as establishing the Serbian-majority municipalities association\u2014and ensure a peaceful transition respecting the rule of law to build trust and long-term stability.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645](https://m.akhbarelyom.com/news/NewDetails/4711207/1/%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81)\n\n**Is the UN still beneficial to small countries?**\nOn September 23, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump questioned the purpose of the United Nations during his address to the 80th UN General Assembly (UNGA), criticizing it for failing to resolve conflicts despite its potential. His remarks echoed concerns raised by many nations, particularly small states, about the UN\u2019s effectiveness due to the disproportionate influence of powerful members in the Security Council, especially the veto power held by permanent members. This imbalance undermines the UN Charter and international humanitarian law, as seen in the escalating crisis in Gaza, where the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed famine in Gaza Governorate by August 22, 2025, with projections of expansion by late September. By September 25, 2025, 157 of the UN\u2019s 193 member states\u2014about 81%\u2014recognized the State of Palestine, including the UK, Canada, France, Australia, and Portugal. While Trump argued that recognizing Palestine would reward Hamas for the October 2023 attacks, most countries, including Caribbean states, condemned Hamas\u2019s actions but affirmed the Palestinian right to statehood. They called for hostage releases, an end to indiscriminate attacks, and a two-state political solution, emphasizing that criticism of Israeli policies must not be conflated with antisemitism. On climate change, Trump dismissed it as \u2018the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,\u2019 contradicting small island states like Palau, whose President Surangel Whipps Jr. stressed that climate action is a matter of survival. Despite acknowledging China\u2019s rising emissions, small states urged all major emitters to cut greenhouse gases, noting China\u2019s 2025 announcement to reduce emissions by 7\u201310% below peak levels by 2035. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres emphasized that climate action is demanded by science, law, economics, and public will, warning that current pledges are inadequate and that multipolarity without effective multilateral institutions risks chaos. The U.S. has stepped back from leadership, while China\u2019s share of the UNFCCC budget is set to rise under the 2026\u201327 budget, though this reflects a bureaucratic adjustment, not a new climate finance pledge. Small states, including Caribbean nations, stress the need for U.S. engagement not only for resources but because U.S. climate impacts affect regional economies through rising insurance and transport costs. They also welcomed Trump\u2019s comments on Ukraine, expressing support for Ukraine reclaiming its territory and calling for swift progress. Despite structural limitations\u2014such as Security Council dominance, uneven rule application, volatile financing, and the politicization of science\u2014small states affirm the UN remains valuable. It is the only forum where all states are present, where concerns can be raised, and where specialized agencies deliver tangible services. However, credibility is strained when equity and consistency are compromised. The author, Sir Ronald Sanders, concludes that small states must continue using the UN\u2019s functional mechanisms while holding powerful members accountable, as the system\u2019s flaws stem from member behavior, not the Charter itself.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 07:49 PM\nSource:[nicefmradio.com](https://www.nicefmradio.com/is-the-un-still-beneficial-to-small-countries/)\n\n**How Will the Next UN Chief Be Chosen and Who Wants the Job?**\nA new United Nations Secretary-General will be elected for a five-year term starting January 1, 2027. The formal process begins when the UN Security Council and General Assembly send a joint letter soliciting nominations by the end of 2025. Candidates must be nominated by a UN member state, with regional rotation traditionally followed\u2014next due is Latin America, though some diplomats expect candidates from other regions. Publicly declared candidates include Michelle Bachelet of Chile, nominated by President Gabriel Boric on September 23, 2025; Rebeca Grynspan of Costa Rica, nominated by President Rodrigo Chaves on October 8, 2025; and Rafael Grossi of Argentina, who confirmed his candidacy on September 3, 2025. The Security Council will conduct secret straw polls using 'encourage,' 'discourage,' or 'no opinion' votes until consensus is reached, requiring nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the five permanent members (U.S., Russia, UK, China, France). The Council then adopts a resolution recommending a candidate to the General Assembly, which traditionally approves the appointment by consensus. The General Assembly adopted a resolution in September 2025 to improve transparency: candidates must submit a public vision statement, disclose funding sources, and consider suspending current UN roles during the campaign to avoid conflicts of interest. The Secretary-General serves as the UN\u2019s chief administrative officer, overseeing over 30,000 civilian staff, 11 peacekeeping operations with around 60,000 personnel, a core budget of $3.7 billion, and a peacekeeping budget of $5.6 billion. Despite limited formal power\u2014since military force and sanctions are controlled by the Security Council\u2014the role is seen as a diplomatic and advocacy leadership position. No woman has ever served as Secretary-General, and the General Assembly expressed 'regret' over this in its 2025 resolution, urging member states to strongly consider female candidates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 09:15 PM\nSource:[Asharq Al-Awsat](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5200331)\n\n**UN picks rights council members with bad records**\nThe United Nations General Assembly elected 14 new members to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on October 15, 2025, for three-year terms beginning in January 2026. The election process, marked by a lack of competition, saw all candidates selected by default through regional group consensus, requiring only a simple majority of the 193-member assembly\u2014making victory nearly guaranteed. Critics, including Hillel Neuer, Executive Director of UN Watch, condemned the selection as 'hypocritical' and likened it to 'the foxes guarding the henhouse.' Human rights activists argue that several new members have poor human rights records. Angola scored 28/100 in civil and political freedoms (Freedom House), Egypt 18/100, Iraq 31/100, Pakistan 32/100, and Vietnam a mere 20/100, with documented religious persecution and internet censorship. Despite India\u2019s 63/100 score, it is considered partly free. South Africa, though listed as free, has a 'questionable' record. Meanwhile, Estonia, Slovenia, Chile, Ecuador, Italy, and the United Kingdom are established democracies. UN Watch reports that 56% of current council members are not democracies, including China, Cuba, Qatar, Sudan, and Somalia. Neuer criticized the European Union for silence on the 'hypocritical candidates' that undermine the council\u2019s credibility. The selection process, according to the article, grants legitimacy to authoritarian regimes and insults nations seeking political transparency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/3125116/un-picks-rights-council-members-with-bad-records)\n\n**Editorial: 80 Years Since UN Founding \u2013 Rebuilding the Foundation for Global Cooperation**\nAs the United Nations marks its 80th anniversary amid rising 'national-first' global trends, the organization faces growing instability.

Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza, which the UN Human Rights Council\u2019s independent investigative committee has labeled as potential genocide, highlight the failure of global consensus. The Trump administration\u2019s 'America First' policy led to the U.S. withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council and WHO, and abandoning the Iran nuclear deal. The UN\u2019s effectiveness has also been hampered by structural flaws, particularly in the Security Council, where permanent members (the U.S., Russia, China, the UK, and France) retain veto power despite the expansion of membership from 51 to 193 countries. The Council has repeatedly failed to act during crises in Ukraine and Gaza due to vetoes by the U.S. and Russia. The article notes that despite the UN\u2019s historical successes\u2014such as mediating the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and leading the eradication of smallpox\u2014its relevance is now questioned. The UN\u2019s operational reforms, such as the 'UN80 Initiative' launched by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in March 2025 to improve efficiency and cut costs, are necessary but must not compromise the organization\u2019s core functions. Japan, a founding member since 1956, has long viewed the UN as a cornerstone of its foreign policy, contributing financially (reaching about 20% of total funding by 2000) and sending prominent figures like Sadako Ogata as High Commissioner for Refugees. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba questioned in September 2025 whether the current UN fulfills its original purpose. The article concludes that in an increasingly divided world, the UN must reassert its role as a bridge between nations, and countries like Japan must uphold their responsibility in doing so.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20251023/ddm/005/070/105000c)\n\n**Explainer-How will the next UN chief be chosen and who wants the job?**\nThe process for selecting the next United Nations Secretary-General will formally begin when the Security Council and the General Assembly send a joint letter soliciting nominations by the end of 2025. Candidates must be nominated by a UN member state, with the position traditionally rotating among regions\u2014following Eastern Europe (Antonio Guterres, Portugal), Latin America is next, though candidates from other regions may emerge. Publicly declared candidates include Michelle Bachelet of Chile, nominated by President Gabriel Boric on September 23, 2025; Rebeca Grynspan of Costa Rica, nominated by President Rodrigo Chaves on October 8, 2025; and Rafael Grossi of Argentina, who confirmed his candidacy on September 3, 2025. The 15-member Security Council will conduct secret straw polls using 'encourage,' 'discourage,' or 'no opinion' votes until a consensus is reached, requiring nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the five permanent members (U.S., Russia, UK, China, France). The process may take multiple rounds, as seen in 2016 when six straw polls were needed. The Security Council then adopts a resolution recommending the candidate, which the General Assembly typically approves as a formality. To increase transparency, the General Assembly adopted a resolution in September 2025 requiring candidates to submit a public vision statement, disclose funding sources, and consider suspending their current UN roles to avoid conflicts of interest. The role of Secretary-General, described as 'equal parts diplomat and advocate, civil servant and chief executive officer,' oversees over 30,000 civilian staff, 11 peacekeeping operations with ~60,000 personnel, a $3.7 billion core budget, and a $5.6 billion peacekeeping budget. Despite the title, the Secretary-General has limited executive power due to the Security Council\u2019s control over military force and sanctions. There is growing momentum to appoint the first female Secretary-General in the UN\u2019s 80-year history, with the General Assembly expressing 'regret' that no woman has held the role and urging countries to strongly consider female candidates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 03:15 PM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/world/explainer-how-will-the-next-un-chief-be-chosen-and-who-wants-the-job/2768821/)\n\n**Progressive Global Alliance Unanimously Adopts Resolution for Ceasefire, Palestinian Statehood, and Reconstruction of Gaza**\nThe Progressive Global Alliance's 40-member council, representing various geopolitical regions worldwide, unanimously adopted a resolution on September 21, 2025, calling for an immediate end to the destruction in Gaza, the termination of the Israeli occupation, humanitarian aid and reconstruction of Gaza, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state through peaceful means along the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. In a video conference statement from Ramallah, Arab world representative Muhammad Ashti highlighted the devastation, killing, and famine in Gaza, as well as the ongoing siege, Judaization, and incursions in the West Bank, including Jerusalem. The council reaffirmed its commitment to a peaceful, just resolution based on the principles adopted by the alliance in Santiago, Chile, on October 6, 2024. It demanded an immediate ceasefire, protection of civilians, unimpeded humanitarian aid, reconstruction of Gaza, and rejection of forced displacement. The resolution emphasized adherence to international law, the two-state solution along the 1967 borders, and the need for international pressure, including economic and trade measures, on Israel until compliance with international law is achieved. The council also called for full implementation of International Court of Justice (ICJ) provisional measures (January 26, 2024) in the South Africa vs. Israel case on the prevention of genocide, the unconditional release of hostages, and compliance with international humanitarian law. Additionally, it urged the enforcement of ICC arrest warrants, implementation of UN General Assembly Resolution 194 on the right of return, and condemnation of efforts to block Palestinian representation at the UN, including U.S. actions restricting President Mahmoud Abbas and his delegation. The council expressed support for international recognition of Palestine within the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital, full UN membership for Palestine, and the implementation of the New York Declaration on the peaceful settlement of the Palestinian issue and the two-state solution.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[fatehwatan.ps](https://fatehwatan.ps/page-196626.html)\n\n**The United Nations at a Crossroads: Between the Legitimacy of the Past and the Reality of a New World Order**\nThe United Nations, marking its global day amid rising global conflicts and instability, is once again under scrutiny as a central institution for international peace, cooperation, and humanitarian action. Since its founding in 1945, the UN has grown from 51 to 193 member states, becoming the sole globally recognized platform with universal legitimacy. It has shaped a comprehensive legal framework across political, economic, social, and human rights domains, serving as a key international reference. The UN has played a vital role beyond humanitarian aid\u2014promoting peace, deploying peacekeeping missions, responding to natural disasters, and fostering dialogue among peoples. Its initiatives have offered hope to millions affected by war, famine, and crises. However, the organization has faced significant failures, particularly in balancing international power dynamics, most notably in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where repeated use of the veto by permanent Security Council members has undermined its effectiveness and credibility. Despite this, the UN has achieved notable successes, including resolutions affirming Palestinian statehood based on pre-1967 borders and mediating peace in multiple regional conflicts. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is highlighted as a model of responsible engagement, consistently upholding international legitimacy, actively supporting UN programs, and ranking among the largest donors to humanitarian efforts. The UN maintains strong ties with major regional bodies, particularly the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which shares its goals in promoting global peace, combating terrorism and extremism, advancing intercultural dialogue, fighting Islamophobia, and protecting human rights. While criticisms persist regarding the UN\u2019s limited influence and declining ability to enforce stability, the article argues that abandoning or sidelining the organization is not viable. Instead, reform is essential\u2014modernizing its structures to enhance fairness, transparency, and representation of global public will, rather than being constrained by great power interests. A call by the Saudi Cabinet on October 1, 2024, underscores this urgency, advocating for Security Council reform to restore credibility and responsiveness amid escalating global crises and declining trust in the international system. The UN now stands at a critical crossroads: either reclaim its historical role as a platform for international justice, or cede ground to power politics and narrow interests. The world urgently needs a new international order rooted in balance, equity, and a UN that truly reflects the conscience of humanity and can meet future challenges.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 09:04 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646](https://www.alwatan.com.sa/article/1171754)\n\n**UK Urges UN Members to Recognize Kosovo for Long-Term Stability**\nThe United Kingdom urged United Nations member states that have not yet recognized Kosovo's independence to join the majority that have done so, emphasizing that recognition is essential for long-term stability and enabling Kosovo to fully realize its potential. Jennifer McNaughtan, the UK\u2019s senior adviser at the UN mission, stated during a Security Council meeting on Kosovo that the UK remains a 'firm supporter of Kosovo\u2019s democratic path and its journey toward integration into European and Atlantic institutions.' She welcomed the smooth conduct of recent local elections and the return of Serbian minority mayors to their positions in northern Kosovo, calling it 'a positive step toward a fully representative local government.' However, she expressed concern over statements threatening to undermine core state institutions, including the Constitutional Court. The UK reiterated its call for Serbia to reduce tensions and hold accountable those responsible for the 2023 Banjska attack, including Milan Radovi\u0107, noting that 'accountability for this attack and attacks on KFOR forces has been delayed too long.' The UK also urged both Kosovo and Serbia to resolve their disputes through EU-mediated dialogue, fully implement agreed commitments\u2014such as establishing the Serbian-majority municipalities association\u2014and ensure a peaceful transition respecting the rule of law to build trust and long-term stability.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645](https://m.akhbarelyom.com/news/NewDetails/4711207/1/%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81)\n\n**Who Determines the Number of Countries in the World and How Many Are There According to 2025 Data?**\nThe article discusses the complexity of determining the exact number of countries in the world, noting that while approximately 200 states are visible on maps, the precise count varies due to differing criteria used by international organizations. The United Nations (UN) recognizes 193 full member states, with Palestine and the Vatican as observer states, totaling 256 entries in its expanded list. However, discrepancies arise with partially or non-recognized states such as Kosovo, Taiwan, Western Sahara, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, and the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics (LNR/DNR), whose status is contested. The UN's membership requires consensus among all permanent Security Council members, which has prevented Kosovo's admission due to vetoes by China and Russia. Taiwan was removed from the UN in 1971 after the General Assembly recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of China. Western Sahara remains a non-self-governing territory under UN decolonization efforts, with Morocco and the Polisario Front contesting sovereignty. Abkhazia and South Ossetia are recognized only by a few states, including Russia. Northern Cyprus is recognized only by Turkey. The LNR and DNR were recognized by Russia in 2022, but this is not acknowledged by the international community, and the UN reaffirmed Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. Other organizations report different numbers: the Russian OKSM lists 253 countries as of August 1, 2024; the IMF includes 190 members, including Kosovo; the WHO recognizes 194 member states, including non-UN members; the IOC includes over 200 National Olympic Committees, including Hong Kong and Puerto Rico; and FIFA includes 211 associations, recognizing England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as separate teams despite being part of the UK. The article concludes that the number of countries is ultimately a matter of political recognition and remains a subject of ongoing debate.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 01:53 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418 Mail.Ru](https://news.mail.ru/society/68244058/)\n\n**Is the UN still beneficial to small countries?**\nOn September 23, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump questioned the purpose of the United Nations during his address to the 80th UN General Assembly (UNGA), criticizing it for failing to resolve conflicts despite its potential. His remarks echoed concerns raised by many nations, particularly small states, about the UN\u2019s effectiveness due to the disproportionate influence of powerful members in the Security Council, especially the veto power held by permanent members. This imbalance undermines the UN Charter and international humanitarian law, as seen in the escalating crisis in Gaza, where the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed famine in Gaza Governorate by August 22, 2025, with projections of expansion by late September. By September 25, 2025, 157 of the UN\u2019s 193 member states\u2014about 81%\u2014recognized the State of Palestine, including the UK, Canada, France, Australia, and Portugal. While Trump argued that recognizing Palestine would reward Hamas for the October 2023 attacks, most countries, including Caribbean states, condemned Hamas\u2019s actions but affirmed the Palestinian right to statehood. They called for hostage releases, an end to indiscriminate attacks, and a two-state political solution, emphasizing that criticism of Israeli policies must not be conflated with antisemitism. On climate change, Trump dismissed it as \u2018the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,\u2019 contradicting small island states like Palau, whose President Surangel Whipps Jr. stressed that climate action is a matter of survival. Despite acknowledging China\u2019s rising emissions, small states urged all major emitters to cut greenhouse gases, noting China\u2019s 2025 announcement to reduce emissions by 7\u201310% below peak levels by 2035. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres emphasized that climate action is demanded by science, law, economics, and public will, warning that current pledges are inadequate and that multipolarity without effective multilateral institutions risks chaos. The U.S. has stepped back from leadership, while China\u2019s share of the UNFCCC budget is set to rise under the 2026\u201327 budget, though this reflects a bureaucratic adjustment, not a new climate finance pledge. Small states, including Caribbean nations, stress the need for U.S. engagement not only for resources but because U.S. climate impacts affect regional economies through rising insurance and transport costs. They also welcomed Trump\u2019s comments on Ukraine, expressing support for Ukraine reclaiming its territory and calling for swift progress. Despite structural limitations\u2014such as Security Council dominance, uneven rule application, volatile financing, and the politicization of science\u2014small states affirm the UN remains valuable. It is the only forum where all states are present, where concerns can be raised, and where specialized agencies deliver tangible services. However, credibility is strained when equity and consistency are compromised. The author, Sir Ronald Sanders, concludes that small states must continue using the UN\u2019s functional mechanisms while holding powerful members accountable, as the system\u2019s flaws stem from member behavior, not the Charter itself.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 07:49 PM\nSource:[nicefmradio.com](https://www.nicefmradio.com/is-the-un-still-beneficial-to-small-countries/)\n\n**Global Leaders Close Ranks at the UN in Support of a State**\nMore than 75% of the 193 United Nations member states now recognize Palestine as a state, with over 150 countries having formally acknowledged it. The wave of recognitions accelerated in September\u202f2025 when European and G7 governments\u2014France, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, Andorra, Malta, Monaco, and San\u202fMarino\u2014joined, along with Australia and Canada. Earlier milestones include the 1988 wave following the Palestinian National Council\u2019s declaration of independence and the 2012 upgrade to permanent observer status at the UN. In 2024, Spain, Ireland, Norway and Slovenia added their recognition. Recognition does not automatically grant full UN membership; the article notes that admission would require at least nine of the fifteen Security\u2011Council members to vote in favor and no veto from any of the five permanent members\u2014US, Russia, China, France or the UK\u2014an outcome blocked by Washington in April\u202f2024. Israel views the recognitions as a \u2018recompensa\u2019 to Hamas, with Prime Minister Benjamin\u202fNetanyahu warning of diplomatic retaliation. The article reports that a conference in New\u202fYork on 22\u201123\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, organized by France and Saudi Arabia, coordinated the latest wave of recognitions and moved the debate to the UN General Assembly.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 12:09 PM\nSource:[Los Tiempos](https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/mundo/20250928/lideres-mundiales-cierran-filas-onu-apoyo-estado-palestino)\n\n**List | These are the 150 countries that recognize the Palestinian State**\nThe article reports that more than 150 of the 193 United Nations member states now recognize Palestine as a state, which exceeds 75\u202f% of the UN. The surge in recognitions accelerated after Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza and the escalation of violence in the West Bank. It lists the countries that have formally recognized Palestine, noting that the first major wave occurred in 1988 when the Palestinian National Council declared independence, followed by a second wave in 2012 when Palestine gained permanent observer status at the UN. In 2024, several European states\u2014Spain, Ireland, Norway and Slovenia\u2014joined the list, and in September\u202f2025 a new wave of recognitions came from G7 and EU members such as France, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, Andorra, Malta, Monaco and San\u202fMarino, as well as Australia and Canada. The article explains that recognition is a political gesture that acknowledges Palestine\u2019s sovereignty and right to self\u2011determination, but it does not automatically grant full UN membership. Full membership would require at least nine of the fifteen Security Council members to vote in favor and no veto from any of the five permanent members\u2014United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom\u2014an outcome that Washington has repeatedly blocked, most recently in April\u202f2024. Israel views the recognitions as a \u2018recompensa\u2019 to Hamas and has warned of possible diplomatic retaliation, while supporters argue the moves keep the two\u2011state solution alive amid deteriorating on\u2011the\u2011ground conditions.

The first wave on 21\u202fSeptember 2024 saw the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Portugal declare recognition, followed on 22\u202fSeptember by France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta and Andorra during a UN General Assembly session. Additional recognitions followed in the months that followed: Finland, Denmark, Croatia, New\u202fZealand and San\u202fMarino, as well as Ireland, Spain and Norway in May\u202f2024, Slovenia and Armenia in June, and Mexico early\u202f2025. The article notes that since the start of the Gaza conflict more than 15 countries have joined this trend. It also recalls the 1988 wave, when 82 states \u2013 mainly from the Middle East, Asia, Africa and the former Soviet bloc \u2013 recognized Palestine after the OLP\u2019s unilateral declaration of independence. Earlier recognitions include Sweden in 2014 and the 2012 admission of Palestine as a non\u2011member observer state at the UN. The piece highlights that the United States may veto further moves toward permanent membership, citing Washington\u2019s opposition under the Trump administration and its revocation of Palestinian leaders\u2019 visas ahead of a New\u202fYork meeting. Germany, Italy and Greece are portrayed as hesitant, while Japan remains non\u2011recognizing among the G7.

He explained that such recognition does not automatically grant full UN membership, but it does enhance Palestine\u2019s international legitimacy, isolate Israel diplomatically, and can lead to increased aid for state\u2011building projects such as judiciary, education and infrastructure.  Salama added that these recognitions are a \"push to revive the two\u2011state solution,\" which the international community views as the optimal resolution to the conflict.\n\nHe outlined the UN membership process: 1) Palestine must submit a formal application to the Secretary\u2011General; 2) the Security Council must approve the application with at least nine votes in favour and no veto from any of the five permanent members (the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China); 3) if the Security Council recommends admission, the General Assembly must approve it by a two\u2011thirds majority of the members present and voting.  The United States has historically used its veto to block Palestine\u2019s admission.\n\nThe article also reports that the New\u202fYork Declaration, adopted by the 2024 Two\u2011State Conference, received an exceptional endorsement from the General Assembly, with 142 countries voting in favour.  The declaration calls for the unification of Gaza and the West Bank under Palestinian Authority rule, the removal of Hamas, and the establishment of a realistic, region\u2011wide path to peace.  It warns that any Israeli annexation of the West Bank would be a \"red line\" with severe political and diplomatic consequences.\n\nKey metrics mentioned: 142 countries endorsed the New\u202fYork Declaration; the Security Council requires nine affirmative votes out of 15, with no veto from the five permanent members; the General Assembly requires a two\u2011thirds majority of members present and voting.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 05:29 AM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u062a\u0648](https://www.vetogate.com/5496866)\n\n**The UN and the Challenge of Peace in the Middle East**\nThe United Nations General Assembly, which convened in New\u202fYork this week, has drawn global attention to the Middle\u2011East conflict. The Assembly, composed of 193 member states, adopts resolutions through regulated procedures and transparent voting. During the high\u2011level week, heads of state and government presented priorities and issued statements, with the Middle\u2011East crisis dominating the debate. Key events include the United States refusing to issue visas to the Palestinian delegation, the General Assembly passing a resolution\u2014by a near\u2011unanimous majority\u2014calling for a cease\u2011fire and a two\u2011state solution, and the U.S. vetoing a Security Council resolution that would have demanded an immediate halt to hostilities. The Assembly also granted the Palestinian delegation an exceptional videoconference slot to ensure its voice in a forum where it has historically been marginalized. A broad\u2011based declaration reaffirmed the two\u2011state formula and recognized the Palestinian National Authority as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Nearly a dozen states\u2014Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and San\u202fMarino\u2014have announced intentions to officially recognize a Palestinian state. Recognition of a state implies that, in case of aggression, the matter becomes an international issue rather than an internal conflict, thereby raising global responsibility. It also supports the long\u2011standing UN\u2011backed two\u2011state solution, which envisions Israel and Palestine coexisting peacefully with borders based on the 1967 lines and under UN supervision, and requires that Palestinian authorities be democratically elected civilians rather than armed groups.\n\nPalestine has held observer\u2011non\u2011member status since 2012, allowing it to participate in the General Assembly and other UN bodies without voting rights. Currently, about three\u2011quarters of member states recognize Palestine as a sovereign state. However, its bid for full membership has repeatedly been blocked: the Security Council requires at least nine affirmative votes and no veto from the five permanent members, followed by a two\u2011thirds majority in the General Assembly. Palestine\u2019s 2011 and 2024 applications were vetoed by the United States, mirroring Kosovo\u2019s situation, whose independence in 2008 is recognized by over a hundred states but is still blocked by Russia and China. These examples illustrate how great\u2011power geopolitics determines new state admission to the UN. While Middle\u2011East tensions remain unresolved, the international actions\u2014beyond symbolic gestures\u2014highlight the importance of legitimizing institutions, ensuring regional stability, and upholding peoples\u2019 right to self\u2011determination. Each step toward recognizing the Palestinian state and supporting multilateral mechanisms is a necessary advance toward lasting peace, achievable only through strengthened legitimate institutions, respect for international law, and concerted global will.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/opinion/columnas/2025/9/22/la-onu-el-desafio-de-la-paz-en-medio-oriente-557806.html)\n\n**Recognition of Palestinian State: Symbolic Gesture or Path to Peace**\nThe article reports that about ten countries are expected to formally recognise an independent Palestinian state at a summit before the UN General Assembly. 147 of the 193 UN member states already recognise Palestine, with Mexico being the most recent recogniser in January 2025.  The United States has said it will only recognise a Palestinian state after a \"two\u2011state solution\" is agreed, a position echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said, 'This is a necessary condition, and it contradicts the idea of Palestinian sovereignty.'  The article notes that the Palestinian Authority has observer status at the UN but no voting rights, and that full UN membership would require Security Council approval, where Washington holds veto power.  It describes the limited territorial control of the Palestinian Authority, the 2007 Hamas takeover of Gaza, and the ongoing lack of agreed borders, a capital or army.  The piece lists 40 countries, including China, Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and South Africa, that maintain consular offices in Ramallah or East Jerusalem, while most other states keep their embassies in Tel Aviv.  It cites a 2012 UN General Assembly resolution that upgraded Palestine to a non\u2011member observer state, and a 2024 resolution that expanded its rights within the UN system, though the US vetoed full membership in April 2024.  The article concludes that recognition is largely symbolic, with limited practical impact on the conflict, but could pressure Israel to ease settlement construction and revive the peace process.

In French media, journalists distinguish between 'recognition by several countries at the UN' and 'recognition by the UN', a distinction that matters because membership requires a UN admission process. The UN\u2019s membership criteria, as stated on its website, demand that a state be 'peaceful', accept the obligations of the UN Charter and be deemed 'capable of fulfilling them'. The admission procedure has three stages: a request to the Secretary\u2011General, a Security Council recommendation (requiring nine of 15 votes, including all five permanent members), and a General Assembly vote of two\u2011thirds. Currently, 145 of 193 member states recognise Palestine, far more than the 122 votes needed for admission, yet the Security Council has blocked the bid twice\u2014once in 2011 with only eight votes, and again in 2024 when the United States vetoed a 12\u2011to\u20113 vote. Experts such as Insaf Rezagui of France Culture explain that the veto power of permanent members keeps Palestine from admission, with the US blocking Palestine, Russia blocking Kosovo, and China blocking Taiwan. Jean\u2011Paul Chagnollaud of IREMMO confirms that the US is the main obstacle, saying 'La Palestine ne pourra pas devenir un \u00c9tat membre \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re la faute aux \u00c9tats-Unis'. Despite the lack of UN membership, Palestine holds observer status, granted in 2012 with 138 votes in favour, 41 abstentions and nine against, and enjoys a permanent mission at the UN. The observer status allows attendance at most meetings and access to documents, but not voting rights. Ambassador Hala Abou Hassira of Palestine in Paris remains optimistic, saying that recognition by several countries will 'renforcer le caract\u00e8re juridique de l'\u00c9tat de Palestine' and 'ouvrir la porte pour concr\u00e9tiser son adh\u00e9sion comme \u00c9tat membre'.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Le Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/international/article/palestine-pourquoi-on-parle-de-reconnaissance-a-l-onu-et-non-par-l-onu-et-ce-que-ca-change_255109.html)\n\n**UK, Canada, Australia Recognize Palestine, Heightening Pressure on Israel**\nThe article reports that on 21\u202fSeptember\u202f2024 the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia announced recognition of the State of Palestine, with Portugal following later that day.  According to the piece, the number of countries that have formally recognized Palestine rose to 151, and a further six Western states are expected to join, potentially increasing the total to 157.  The article cites the United Nations\u2019 2012 upgrade of Palestine to a \"non\u2011member observer state\" and notes that full sovereign status still requires a unanimous Security Council resolution, a step that the United States has repeatedly blocked \u2013 the sixth use of its veto in two years to defeat a resolution demanding a cease\u2011fire in Gaza.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s statement on X is quoted: 'We must double our efforts to fight all forms of hatred, release hostages, end violence and suffering, and move toward a two\u2011state solution \u2013 the best hope for peace and security.'  He also criticised Hamas for its October\u202f7 attack and the Israeli government\u2019s continued bombardment of Gaza, calling the violence \"unacceptable\" and urging Israel to lift the blockade.\n\nThe article references the United Nations Independent Investigation Report of 17\u202fSeptember, which confirmed genocide in Gaza, and the subsequent Security Council meeting on 18\u202fSeptember where the U.S. vetoed a cease\u2011fire draft.  It also notes that the U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to hold a high\u2011level meeting on 22\u202fSeptember to discuss a peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue.\n\nAdditional context is provided about the historical role of the UK in the creation of Israel, the 2000\u20112024 evolution of UK\u2011Israel relations, and the recent U.S. and EU responses to the recognition wave.  The piece concludes by highlighting the complex geopolitical landscape, including the positions of Morocco, Taiwan, and other states that have not yet recognized Palestine.\n\nAll figures and quotations are taken directly from the article as published on 22\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 by \u8f49\u89d2\u570b\u969b udn Global.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 10:26 AM\nSource:[\u8f49\u89d2\u570b\u969b udn Global](https://global.udn.com/global_vision/story/8662/9021800)\n\n**France\u2019s recognition of Palestine: Macron\u2019s diplomatic gambit in a shifting global order**\nOn July 24, 2025, French President Emmanuel Macron announced France\u2019s recognition of Palestine as a state, citing the urgent need to end the war in Gaza and address the worsening humanitarian crisis following the escalation on October 7, 2023. This marked a significant policy shift, as France was previously a major arms supplier to Israel\u2014providing an estimated 10,000 rounds of machine-gun ammunition\u2014and had discouraged criticism of Israel under Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, warning it could be seen as antisemitic. By October 2024, France began reducing arms deliveries, eventually halting them entirely, and shifted toward advocating a political solution. France became the first G7 member to recognize Palestine, a move later mirrored by the UK and Canada. The decision is analyzed as a strategic diplomatic gambit: reasserting influence in the Middle East after losing strategic footholds in West Africa due to the rise of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), countering U.S. economic pressure under Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House in November 2024\u2014which imposed aggressive tariffs on French exports like luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, and auto parts\u2014and positioning France as a global mediator. With 147 of 193 UN member states already recognizing Palestine, Macron\u2019s move aims to reshape France\u2019s global role amid a shifting international order. The long-term impact will depend on outcomes at the September 2025 UN General Assembly session and subsequent diplomatic developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 19, 2025 07:01 PM\nSource:[theinformant247.com](https://theinformant247.com/frances-recognition-of-palestine-macrons-diplomatic-gambit-in-a-shifting-global-order/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasts overwhelmingly agree that the probability of the United Nations increasing its membership beyond 193 before January 1, 2026, is extremely low (ranging from 1\u20132%). Across diverse perspectives\u2014diplomatic, legal, area studies, and political science\u2014the consensus is that the primary barrier is the unyielding use of the Security Council veto by permanent members: the United States blocking Palestine, Russia/China blocking Kosovo, and China blocking Taiwan. While recent years have seen an unprecedented surge in diplomatic recognition for Palestine, with over 150 countries now backing its sovereignty, and increased activity at the General Assembly, none of these moves can circumvent the need for Security Council approval, which requires no P5 veto. Procedural obstacles (such as insufficient time for successful completion of the application, Security Council, and General Assembly processes in the remaining two months) further diminish the plausibility of new admissions. Other possible candidates for membership\u2014including Kosovo, Taiwan, and breakaway regions\u2014face even greater diplomatic and legal opposition, with no credible signs of a breakthrough. The historical base rate for new admissions (only one member since 2006) also heavily informs expert judgment. No expert identified any plausible emerging independence or state dissolution process likely to generate a new consensus member before the deadline. While black swan events or a dramatic shift in US/Russian/Chinese policy are not categorically ruled out, there is no evidence of such an imminent change, and the UN's institutional inertia strongly supports the continuation of the status quo. The modal forecast is a 1\u20132% probability of a positive outcome, grounded in base rates, Security Council dynamics, and the intransigence of major power interests.",
