For 45X specifically, there is no clear reporting, legislative language, or advocacy indicating momentum for mandating US subcomponents, nor is there the legislative time or focus to accomplish this before the end of 2025. The fiscal and procedural climate (shutdown, healthcare priorities, weak majorities) further decreases the likelihood.

Interest group theory would predict strong business opposition to sudden sourcing requirements for complex supply chains, with backing from influential clean energy lobbies and swing-district members whose jobs or investments are at risk. The base rate for additional domestic content requirements being added THIS LATE to this specific credit, after lower-hanging fruit (like phasing out credits, or transferring existing requirements), is low. News coverage across sources, including coverage of 45Z, does not mention a live debate or active effort on 45X sourcing\u2014 legislative energy has not crystallized in this direction.

While Trumpist Republicans rhetorically support 'America First' industry, all news signals show their focus is on scaling back clean energy incentives, not building in new complex regulations; attention is overwhelmingly on ACA tax credits and shutdown, not 45X. The insertion of domestic requirements for 45Z is an outlier, seemingly driven by agricultural/rural politics and bipartisan support distinct from advanced manufacturing. There is no evidence in the news that an effort for 45X requirements is being seriously discussed, nor is there legislative bandwidth. Symbolic gestures are possible, but actual passage is highly unlikely before resolution deadline. Thus, the probability that IRA's Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits (45X) will require domestic material or subcomponent sourcing before 2026 is very low, though not strictly zero\u2014there is always some chance for a surprise via legislative horse-trading.

Notably, no forecaster identified any active legislative text, advocacy, or visible movement toward such an amendment; all pointed to gridlock, retrenchment, and legislative capacity being focused elsewhere (primarily budget, shutdown, and healthcare battles). Even the highest forecast (15%) was roundly and convincingly critiqued as unjustifiably high given explicit evidence and theory. Multiple domain experts independently argued for probabilities as low as 2-5%, demonstrating strong consensus. No compelling new evidence or argument in the discussion made a YES scenario seem more plausible than in my initial analysis. To reflect both this convergence and to avoid anchoring just slightly above the consensus tail of 2-5%, I will nudge my probability down, but not to the absolute minimum; last-minute legislative surprises, though exceptionally rare and unindicated, remain nonzero.",

The original question opened on 2025-04-10 18:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/36490). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which established the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (AMPTC) for the domestic production of specific clean energy components.\n\nIn the wake of the 2024 US elections, Republicans took control of both Houses of Congress and the White House, with President Donald Trump [having expressed interest](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta/#the-ira-under-the-incoming-republican-white-house-and-congress) in reducing IRA spending. At the time of this question, congressional Republicans were working on a budget reconciliation bill to possibly enact tax and spending changes to the federal budget (see the Tax Foundation's updated [Budget Reconciliation tracker](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tax-cuts-2025-budget-reconciliation/)).\n\nIt is important to note that in the House of Representatives, the Republicans hold a slim majority of 220 to 213. In March 2025, a group of 21 Republican representatives [sent a letter](https://www.eenews.net/articles/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits/) to House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith to urge him to phase out rather than eliminate the clean energy incentives of the IRA. House Speaker Mike Johnson [told reporters](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5167829-johnson-inflation-reduction-act-ira-climate-tax-infrastructure/), in regard to repealing clean energy tax credits among other policies, \"It\u2019ll be somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.\" It's important to note, too, that reconciliation bills do not always succeed. In July 2017, for example, Senator John McCain famously [cast](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/senate-health-care-vote.html) a decisive No vote to a reconciliation bill that would have repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36490,\"question_id\":35925}}`",

GOP leadership rebuked by MAGA lawmaker on policy vision**\nU.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), a prominent MAGA figure, publicly rebuked Republican leadership, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), for lacking a concrete health care policy plan amid the expiration of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits. On October 22, 2025, Greene criticized Johnson during a GOP conference call for having 'pages of policy' but refusing to disclose any specific proposals. She blamed Democrats for creating the current health insurance crisis, citing the 2021 extension of ACA subsidies that are now expiring, and claimed that without reinstatement, many Americans\u2014especially in Georgia\u2014could face premiums 'more than double.' Greene accused Democrats of admitting that Obamacare is now 'way too expensive' and called on Republicans to 'build the off ramp off of Obamacare' by deregulating healthcare and pharmaceuticals, enforcing price transparency, and promoting market competition to lower costs. She urged Republicans to 'pick up your bat and ball and get in the game,' emphasizing that members are accountable to their constituents, not special interests or political loyalty. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s repeated promises during his first term and 2024 campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare, no comprehensive plan was ever delivered; a 2024 KFF report noted that past Republican proposals would reduce federal spending but increase out-of-pocket costs and uninsured rates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 06:21 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/mike-johnson-2674223536/)\n\n**API now opposes year-round E15 sales, citing shifting, unstable environment for refiners**\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) has reversed its previous stance and now opposes the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025, which would allow year-round sales of E15 gasoline (15% ethanol). In a letter to congressional leaders, API President Mike Sommers cited a dramatically changed operating environment for refiners and fuel blenders due to shifting federal compliance structures, a patchwork of state mandates, and an unstable biofuels marketplace. The legislation, co-sponsored by 16 senators\u2014two each from Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota, and West Virginia, and one each from Arizona, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wisconsin\u2014aims to amend the Clean Air Act to permit year-round E15 use, currently limited to part of the year. API member companies had invested in new infrastructure to produce region-specific E15 blends for eight Midwestern states that petitioned the EPA to opt out of the summer volatility waiver for E10. However, just days before delivery, the EPA issued emergency waivers that negated the opt-out requests, rendering the investments sunk costs and causing financial and operational harm. Additionally, the Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4 eliminated Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credits for imported feedstocks from countries with lower carbon intensity, such as Brazil. Sommers emphasized that domestic feedstock is insufficient to meet U.S. biofuel production capacity, meaning foreign feedstocks remain essential for viable operations. API remains willing to work with Congress to develop a balanced E15 policy that supports fuel choice, investment certainty, and a stable marketplace for consumers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 05:15 AM\nSource:[The Center Square: National Stories](https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/article_680e5dd0-0e0f-40cd-91a7-6e68483ed443.html?a)\n\n**Trump\u2019s budget bill is making energy expensive again**\nAccording to a clean energy business leader writing for the Minnesota Reformer, President Donald Trump\u2019s phaseout of clean energy tax credits\u2014via the One Big Beautiful Bill Act\u2014has triggered a rise in energy costs across the U.S. The repeal of these credits, which had supported hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs since 2022, is projected to cost over 80,000 jobs and increase cumulative household energy expenses by $170 billion from 2025 to 2034, according to Energy Innovation. Since Trump took office, electricity prices have risen 10%, outpacing inflation, with nearly 60 utilities planning rate hikes affecting 56.7 million electric and 26 million gas customers. As of March, over $24 billion in late utility payments were owed. Despite solar, wind, and battery storage supplying over 90% of new U.S. energy capacity in 2024, the bill has stalled clean energy projects. The author criticizes Republican lawmakers for opposing the very policies that created 400,000 new clean energy jobs\u2014most in Republican districts\u2014calling the situation an 'avoidable energy crisis.'

Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, along with 12 other Republican lawmakers, has urged House Speaker Mike Johnson to prioritize extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits before they expire at the end of 2025. The bipartisan-leaning letter, which praises Johnson\u2019s leadership in passing a budget resolution and reopening the federal government, calls for immediate action on healthcare affordability once the government shutdown ends. Gim\u00e9nez, the only Florida Republican to sign the letter, represents a district with the fifth-highest number of ACA enrollees in the U.S.\u2014344,000 Marketplace users, 241,000 of whom receive Advanced Premium Tax Credits. The letter emphasizes that allowing the credits to lapse would harm constituents and calls for a conservative path to reform, including fiscal responsibility and targeted assistance. Notably, Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar, who represents a district with 236,000 ACA enrollees\u2014more than Gim\u00e9nez\u2014did not sign the letter, and her office has not responded to inquiries. The group insists that while they oppose the Democratic-created expiration, they support long-term healthcare reforms. Gim\u00e9nez previously cosponsored a bill to extend the subsidies for one year and criticized Democrats for setting the expiration date during the original ACA passage. The letter does not signal full support for the ACA but calls for immediate action to protect families from rising premiums.

Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.) and Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), urged Speaker Mike Johnson to address the expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits immediately after the government shutdown ends. The lawmakers acknowledged the shutdown's harm to federal employees, veterans, law enforcement, and border agents, but argued that healthcare should not be tied to the funding debate. They emphasized that allowing the enhanced ACA subsidies to lapse would cause significant harm to millions of Americans, particularly working families. While supporting a conservative path to reform the credits to make them more fiscally responsible and targeted, they stressed that Republicans should not take healthcare away from those who depend on it. However, House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., rejected a clean extension of the subsidies, calling it 'insanity' without debate or negotiation, and stated that any deal would require weeks of discussion, including funding mechanisms and broader healthcare reforms. Democrats are using the shutdown as leverage to force a vote on extending the subsidies, which were expanded during the pandemic and extended through 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act. The House passed a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government through FY2025 on September 19, but Senate Democrats have blocked it 11 times as of October 21, 2025, leaving the shutdown unresolved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-push-renew-obamacare-subsidies-while-rejecting-democrats-shutdown-tie-in)\n\n**Nation backs Trump manufacturing agenda despite turbulence: Poll**\nA poll conducted by Tony Fabrizo for the Restoring American Dominance Coalition found that 59% of voters support the Duty Drawback program\u2014 which refunds up to 99% of certain import duties, taxes, and fees for goods exported or destroyed\u2014 compared to 17%, a 3-to-1 margin, nearly one year before the 2026 elections. The program, introduced during Trump\u2019s first term, was partially repealed by the House\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act but restored in the Senate before being signed into law by Trump in July. The poll revealed that Republican candidates opposing Duty Drawback lost an average of 7 percentage points, with a 26-point drop among Trump voters. In a scenario where a Republican candidate supported ending the policy to raise revenue via higher taxes on exporters, the Democratic lead expanded from 3 points to 10 points, driven by a loss of support from Trump voters\u2014from an initial 84-point lead to 58 points. The House is highly competitive in 2026 due to Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s narrow majority. The poll of 1,000 registered voters across 28 battleground districts (Oct. 5\u20137, 2025, in English and Spanish) showed that over 90% of voters believe Congress should support policies incentivizing American manufacturing and job creation, with 68% calling it very important. Among Trump voters, 89% share this view. Similarly, over 80% of voters support tax policies encouraging U.S. manufacturing, and 90% of Trump voters support foreign direct investment in American manufacturing. About 75% of independent voters and Harris voters also support such policies. The margin of error is \u00b13.1 points. The Restoring American Dominance Coalition, a conservative nonprofit founded by former Trump Domestic Policy Council director Joe Grogan, aims to revive American manufacturing and position the U.S. as a global leader in trade, innovation, and production.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3857496/trump-manufacturing-agenda-public-approval-poll/)\n\n**Taxation & Representation, Oct. 2025**\nThe U.S. government faces a potential shutdown on October 1, 2025, after the 'Big 4' leaders failed to reach an agreement with President Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) advocated for a broader deal including extended Advance Premium Tax Credits (eAPTCs), reversal of health care cuts from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, P.L. 119-21), and limits on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) unilateral funding rescission authority. However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) pushed for a 'clean' stopgap bill funding the government through November 21, 2025. The Treasury Department released a contingency plan stating the IRS will remain operational for five business days during a shutdown, with all employees exempt from furlough due to multiyear appropriations from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-169). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) confirmed that layoffs, if implemented, would require 60 days\u2019 notice. Meanwhile, the OBBBA accelerated the phaseout of clean energy tax credits, ending new electric vehicle (EV) tax credits as of October 1, 2025, with the alternative fuel vehicle refueling credit expiring on June 30, 2026. Investors are shifting capital toward clean energy projects that began construction before the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (ITC) expired at the end of 2024. The Treasury and IRS released the 2025\u20132026 Priority Guidance Plan (PGP), prioritizing 105 projects, including OBBBA implementation, tribal tax issues, digital assets, and SECURE 2.0. The PGP also outlines the phaseout of residential clean energy credits after 2025, with wind and solar project deadlines extending through 2027, and the Clean Fuel Production Credit extended through 2029 with stricter domestic content rules. On September 22, the IRS issued proposed regulations for the 'No Tax on Tips' provision under OBBBA, allowing up to $25,000 in qualified tips to be deducted annually from 2025 to 2028, phasing out for taxpayers earning over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers). Eligible occupations include hospitality, food service, entertainment, personal wellness, transportation, home services, recreation, and digital content creators. The public comment period runs until October 22, 2025, with a public hearing on October 23. The Treasury also released Notices 2025-46 and 2025-49 on the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT), clarifying rules for domestic transactions, financially troubled firms, and consolidated groups. The IRS Office of Chief Counsel faces staffing shortages after over 350 attorneys resigned, delaying guidance on OBBBA provisions like tip income and R&D deductions. The IRS is phasing out paper tax refund checks starting September 30, 2025, under President Trump\u2019s Executive Order, though lawmakers from Maine and New Hampshire urged a delay, citing risks to vulnerable populations and rural communities. The IRS has extended a deferred resignation offer to employees on administrative leave for the third time, with no disclosure on the number of acceptances. U.S. multinational companies are urging faster OECD Pillar Two negotiations, warning that delays could impose high compliance costs without a 'side-by-side' exception for the U.S. system. Some countries, including France, Spain, and Kenya, have maintained digital services taxes (DSTs), while India and Canada repealed theirs under U.S. pressure. The Treasury and IRS expect to release four pieces of international tax guidance by year-end, covering FDDEI, controlled foreign corporations, and foreign-earned income credits. The permanent extension of 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA, costing $362.7 billion over 10 years, has drawn criticism from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who asked the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to detail its beneficiaries and impacts. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on digital asset taxation on October 1, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 10:38 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/taxation-representation-oct-2025-4044212/)\n\n**Trump Cuts $8B Clean Energy Projects in Blue States**\nThe Trump administration has cancelled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for 223 projects across 16 states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, according to the U.S. Energy Department. The cuts, which include up to $1.2 billion for California\u2019s hydrogen hub (ARCHES) and $1 billion for a Pacific Northwest hydrogen project, were justified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright as necessary to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure economic viability. Russell Vought, White House budget director, stated the cancellations targeted 'Left's climate agenda' and were politically motivated, citing that all 16 affected states supported Harris and both of their senators opposed a Republican short-term funding bill. The Energy Department reviewed grants awarded during the transition period after the 2024 election, including over a quarter awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day. While Wright claimed the decisions were based on business criteria and not politics, Democrats and environmental groups condemned the move as punitive and shortsighted. Senator Patty Murray called it a 'blatant attempt to punish the political opposition,' and California Governor Gavin Newsom warned the cuts threaten over 200,000 jobs. The Department confirmed that terminated projects will not be restored after the government reopens. Other projects in West Virginia, Texas, and Louisiana are under review. Recipients have 30 days to appeal. The cancellations are part of a broader rollback of climate programs, including rescinding $13 billion in unspent funds from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Environmental advocates, including the NRDC and Clean Air Task Force, argue the move undermines clean energy innovation, raises energy costs, and weakens U.S. competitiveness in global clean tech markets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[manufacturing.net](https://www.manufacturing.net/energy/news/22951713/trump-cuts-8b-clean-energy-projects-in-blue-states)\n\n**The Uncomfortable Truths About Why The EV Credits Had To Die**\nThe article explains why the U.S. EV tax credits, originally part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), were abruptly ended next week under President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, cutting a $393\u202fbillion clean\u2011vehicle program. It cites a Penn Wharton study that estimated the IRA\u2019s clean\u2011vehicle provisions would cost $393\u202fbillion between 2023 and 2032, making them a target for spending cuts. The piece argues that the credits were doomed from the start because Americans dislike being told what to buy, the rules were overly complex, and the credits mainly benefited high\u2011income buyers \u2013 a point echoed by a Republican National Committee fact sheet that called them \u2018a giveaway to the rich.\u2019 It also notes that the credits were introduced during the Bush administration, expanded under Biden to spur domestic EV manufacturing and compete with China, but were ultimately killed by Trump and a Republican\u2011controlled Congress. The article includes quotes such as \u2018The U.S. consumer is really different,\u2019 said Raul Arredondo, and \u2018It\u2019s not just, \u2018OK, here\u2019s a tax credit.\u2019 It\u2019s, \u2018Here\u2019s a tax credit, and then here\u2019s 100,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations\u2026\u2019 said Chad Cummings, to illustrate consumer attitudes and regulatory complexity.

Here's What To Watch**\nThe Republican\u2011led House passed a large tax and spending bill that would cut or eliminate key subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), potentially raising the cost of clean energy and slowing investment.  The House version removes the 30\u202f% federal tax credit for residential solar systems and for home battery storage, and it scrapes the 30\u202f% credit for companies that lease solar panels, such as Sunrun.  Reuben Ly, a sales manager for A1 Sun in Berkeley, said, \u2018If I could see a knockout punch for solar, it would be if all of a sudden systems got 30\u202f% more expensive and payback times got 30\u202f% longer.\u2019  The bill also ends the $2,000 federal tax credit for high\u2011efficiency electric heat pumps and the $7,500 rebate for most electric vehicles, which would cut the projected EV share of new car sales in 2030 from about 48\u202f% to 42\u202f%, according to research by Elaine\u202fBuckberg.  In addition, the bill adds a $250 charge to EV registration fees and a $100 charge to hybrid vehicles.  BloombergNEF analysts Ethan\u202fZindler and Derrick\u202fFlakoll warned that the IRA\u2019s provisions that bar U.S. projects from using components from China would make it \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for U.S. solar and battery manufacturers to qualify for tax incentives.  Zindler said, \u2018For investors, the message is clear: The U.S. may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago.\u2019  The IRA\u2019s tax credits have already spurred $321\u202fbillion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean\u2011energy facilities, representing 4.7\u202f% of all U.S. private investment in Q1\u202f2025, and an additional $522\u202fbillion of announced investment across 2,217 facilities, which is expected to create more than 680,000 jobs, according to Energy Innovation.  Rhodium Group estimates that repealing the energy tax credits could increase U.S. emissions by at least 500\u202fmillion metric tons to more than a gigaton in 2035.  Senate Majority Leader John\u202fThune said the Senate will write its own version of the bill, but the House\u2019s slim margin may limit major changes.

The IRA, signed by President Biden in 2022, was a significant climate law providing hundreds of billions of dollars for tax credits and programs to bolster the clean energy sector. The OBBBA also cuts billions in spending from clean energy programs under the law, eliminates credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles, and phases out tax credits for investment in and production of clean energy. However, some tax credits are still available for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal energy, energy storage, clean hydrogen, and carbon capture. Environmental activists and experts say that the repeal will create massive uncertainty in the market, making it difficult to make capital investments and projects. They also note that the US is ceding the electric vehicle market to China, which is leading the world in producing cheap and cutting-edge cars.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3478969/biden-trump-legislative-legacy-undercut-repeal-ira-climate-measures/)\n\n**Trump Tax Cut Bill Expected to Harm Climate Change Efforts**\nThe Trump administration's tax cut bill, which was passed by the US House of Representatives on July 3, is expected to significantly reduce investment in climate change mitigation, according to initial analysis by environmental think tanks. The bill would end the tax incentives for electric vehicles established by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and gradually phase out support for solar and wind power. However, tax incentives for nuclear, geothermal, and hydroelectric power, as well as battery storage, would remain in place. Richard Black, policy and strategy director at the UK think tank Ember, said, 'It is almost certain that this will slow down the introduction of renewable energy in the US.' As China is already leading the world in clean energy investment and innovation, the US government's decision to 'not compete' is seen as a mistake. The Climate and Energy Solutions Center, a US environmental think tank, estimates that the US, which is the world's second-largest CO2 emitter, will see an 8% increase in CO2 emissions by 2035 due to this bill. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering relaxing regulations on coal-fired power plants, which could lead to further increases in greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the bill includes favorable policies for the fossil fuel industry, including tax breaks for domestic coal production and reduced fees for oil and gas extraction on federal land. Mike Sommers, CEO of the US Oil and Gas Association, praised the bill, saying, 'All of our priorities are included.' Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a leading US environmental NGO, strongly criticized the bill, saying, 'The lawmakers who voted for this bill have prioritized tax cuts for the wealthy over the health, budgets, public lands, and oceans of the American people.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: July 04, 2025 03:23 AM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20250704/k00/00m/030/107000c)\n\n**How Will Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' Impact US Climate Policy?**\nPresident Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' has largely repealed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a landmark climate law signed by Joe Biden in 2022. The IRA allocated $370 billion in tax credits for renewable energy projects, but these credits are now set to be slashed. 'These credits were all huge motivating incentives for clean energy to be built out across the country,' said Jean Su, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. 'With those removed, those renewable energy projects are all at risk of entirely failing.' The bill also eliminates tax credits for electric vehicles and fuel-efficient home and commercial upgrades, while preserving credits for nuclear, geothermal power, hydrogen, and carbon capture technologies. Critics argue that the bill locks in market volatility and incentivizes utilities to build costlier fossil plants, leading to higher electricity rates. Trump, who received an estimated $445 million from Big Oil during his campaign, has framed the clean energy rollbacks as a victory over what he calls the 'Green New Scam.' 'The pipeline of projects that had begun construction by the prescribed time is eventually going to dry up -- I don't know how they're going to start financing these projects without the tax credits,' said Doug Jones, a tax attorney and partner at Husch Blackwell.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 08:09 PM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-will-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-impact-us-climate-policy-8821894)\n\n**US Senate Passes Semiconductor Tax Credit Bill, Expanding Benefits to 35%**\nThe US Senate has passed a tax reform bill that increases the semiconductor tax credit from 25% to 35%. This is despite opposition from former President Donald Trump. The bill, known as the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' (OBBBA), was passed with a 50-50 vote in the Senate, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. Three Republican senators voted against the bill due to concerns about national debt. The tax credit will provide up to 35% of the tax benefit for investments in semiconductor factories and equipment, exceeding the current 25% rate. The benefit will apply to facilities that start operation before the end of 2026 and were under construction before the end of 2026. Trump has argued that investment incentives are not necessary, but the Senate has strengthened the incentives instead. The bill also includes benefits for semiconductor factory construction and loan support. Global semiconductor companies such as Samsung, SK Hynix, Intel, TSMC, and Micron are expanding their investments in the US based on this policy. However, some provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which aimed to promote renewable energy and electric vehicle conversion, have been significantly reduced. The tax credit for electric vehicle purchases will be reduced to $7,500 by the end of September and will be phased out by 2032, two years earlier than planned. Support for solar and wind power facilities will also be limited. The tax credit will only apply to facilities that start operation before the end of 2026, and a separate tax will be imposed on facilities that use Chinese components. The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC), which benefits Korean battery companies, will remain unchanged. The bill will now be sent to the House of Representatives for further consideration.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: July 03, 2025 02:05 AM\nSource:[\uae30\uc220\ub85c \uc138\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc14\uafb8\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc758 \ub180\uc774\ud130](https://it.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2023092143531)\n\n**Senate removes excise tax on renewable energy industry from Trump domestic policy bill**\nThe Senate has removed a new excise tax on the renewable energy industry from President Trump's domestic policy bill, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski's support. The tax would have increased energy prices by 8-10% and cost clean energy businesses $4-$7 billion by 2036. However, environmental groups are concerned about the bill's phase-out of wind and solar tax credits, which will make it harder to build new clean energy projects. The bill also terminates numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs. A new analysis predicts that the changes in the Senate bill will eliminate 1.6 million jobs, cause $290 billion in lost GDP, and increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035. Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency, saying it will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on. 'The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,' said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said, 'People should know that the policy is set to have these expire, and I support that. It's more a matter of doing it in a responsible [and] sustainable way.' A potential compromise is being discussed that would give wind and solar projects a full year of production and investment tax credits. Conservative Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) said, 'I think it's going to cause real problems. So if I were the Senate, I would take the House's position right now.'

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that the probability of the IRA's Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits (45X) requiring the use of domestic materials or subcomponents before January 1, 2026, is very low. Across tax law, clean energy policy, legal studies, public policy, and political science perspectives, the consensus is that the dominant legislative action in the Republican-controlled government has been the rollback, phaseout, or repeal of clean energy tax credits like 45X rather than increasing their regulatory burdens or adding new domestic content requirements. Experts note that while some political rhetoric and recent narrowly-focused legislation (such as the 45Z fuel credit) show a precedent for domestic sourcing restrictions, these exceptions are rare, highly targeted, and not extended to 45X. Legislative gridlock, government shutdowns, administrative capacity constraints, opposition from manufacturers dependent on global supply chains, and a lack of any explicit legislative proposals or news coverage regarding new 45X requirements all further reduce the likelihood. While marginal probabilities are assigned for a last-minute political compromise adding such a requirement (tail risks around 2\u201315%), the overwhelming base rate, political trend, and stakeholder analysis support a strong NO forecast. The likelihood of an enacted domestic sourcing requirement for 45X in the remaining two months of 2025 is consistently forecasted as extremely low, typically under 10%.",
