Technical implementation of usage reporting (not just purchase) would also be highly controversial, complex, and opposed by industry and privacy advocates.

While there is intense congressional and public attention on AI security, the regulatory space is highly fragmented and industry capture by economic actors remains strong. Even existing notification rules for lower-volume export orders (from the January 2025 Commerce rule) are focused on export diversion risk\u2014not proactive domestic monitoring or reporting of model training activity. Additionally, technical implementation of true usage reporting\u2014especially at the chip/cluster/firmware level\u2014requires stabilized new actor-networks (government-agency/industry consensus, technical standardization, compliance mechanisms), none of which show signs of rapidly coalescing. The narrower forms of reporting in the current regime (export shipment tracking, not domestic usage) do not fall under the resolution criteria of this question. Even highly publicized concerns about Chinese access continue to be managed by entity lists, licensing, and export bans, not by aggregate or granular reporting of domestic purchases. Thus, base-rate trends and current actor alignments weigh heavily against a new GPU usage reporting requirement for domestic buyers being enacted and implemented at scale within the next two months.",

There are no visible, actionable signals of a regulatory leap, and the few existing reporting requirements are either export-focused or allow long compliance windows, not domestic usage as per the resolution. Thus, my original estimate was too generous to the possibility space.",

The original question opened on 2023-05-17 15:19:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17094). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nTraining large AI models like GPT-4 requires a large number of high-performance GPUs, such as NVIDIA Tesla V100 and A100 models, or Google TPUs (tensor processing units).\n\nOne way for AI policy to impact training (and, to a lesser degree, serving/inference) of large AI models is to track how these chips are used. This can be done via firmware - software that runs on the chip, typically for things like power management, memory allocation, tracking device performance, reporting crashes, or importantly, reporting usage statistics. Or it could be done at the cluster or datacenter level.\n\nIn Oct 2022, the [US implemented export controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_New_Export_Controls_on_Advanced_Computing_and_Semiconductors_to_China), that, roughly speaking, bans export of semiconductors that involve US in their manufacturing chain to China. These chips are the ones referred to as \"US-export-controlled\". This willingness of the US to put restrictions on how certain chips are sold to certain people implies a potential for regulations on the monitoring of certain chips.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17094,\"question_id\":17094}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **YES** if by Dec 31, 2025, US law requires purchasers of a large number of GPUs to report their usage in the training of large AI models, and **NO** otherwise.",
        "fine_print": "Each point in the resolution will be interpreted broadly:\n\n* Can be any reasonable definition of GPUs, such as all NVIDIA or ARM GPUs covered by the export controls established in 2022. If training of large AI systems can be done by a wider set of chips, resolves based on whether such chips are generally implicated by these laws.\n\n* \"Large number of GPUs\" here can be any reasonable threshold, such as >100 GPUs, or >$100k of GPUs.\n\n* \"training of large AI models\" will be interpreted broadly - for example, requiring firmware that tracks whether _any_ ML training is occurring would qualify. However, the regulations must apply at the level of chip monitoring  - it is not sufficient that the purchasers of GPUs must summarize their usage patterns qualitatively.\n\n* \"Report\" here means that the usage must be reported to some governing authority, at a level of detail such that the governing authorities can clearly determine if large AI models have been trained using the chips.",

The report, authored by Garens Burk, Daike Kang, and Byron Tao, reveals that the U.S. government sometimes facilitated the sale of American technologies to Chinese government-linked bodies such as the Chinese police, surveillance firms, and security agencies. This was achieved through legal loopholes enabling Chinese entities\u2014both governmental and private\u2014to bypass strict export controls via cloud services, third-party distributors, and gaps in sanctions imposed after the Tiananmen massacre. Despite bipartisan objections, Congress has overlooked these loopholes, allowing China to purchase advanced semiconductor equipment worth over $20 billion in 2024 alone, despite existing restrictions. The report criticizes technology companies and their lobbying groups, noting that the influence of Silicon Valley and its associated lobbies became particularly evident during the presidency of Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s administration pursued policies to strengthen ties between the U.S. economy, taxpayers, and tech firms, including a $11 billion government stake in Intel and relaxed export controls on NVIDIA and AMD chips to China in exchange for 15% of revenue. Over the past 20 years, tech companies spent hundreds of millions on lobbying efforts aimed at weakening trade regulations affecting U.S.-China business. Chou Fengsu, a Chinese activist who witnessed the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown and later became a U.S. citizen, told Associated Press that the U.S. government ignores how American companies aid Beijing in surveillance and social control. He testified before Congress in 2024, urging an investigation into the role of U.S. firms in building China\u2019s surveillance infrastructure, a call reinforced by a separate AP report from September 2024. Fengsu described the U.S. government\u2019s inaction as 'profit-driven,' stating, 'This is a strategic failure of the United States.' The report also reveals Intel\u2019s past collaboration with a Chinese company to collect fingerprints without informing U.S. authorities. NVIDIA denies its chips are used in surveillance systems or software and claims no cooperation with Chinese law enforcement. Chinese entities can access cutting-edge AI chips and their capabilities without purchasing them directly, using cloud computing platforms like Microsoft Azure and AWS. The report notes that state-owned SDIC Contech attempted to access AWS and Azure services through third-party contracts. The Shanghai Qi Zhi Research Institute, a government-backed entity working on sensitive technologies including encryption, sought over $280,000 in cloud services from Azure to leverage OpenAI\u2019s chips. Dahua and Hikvision, leading Chinese surveillance camera manufacturers, both publicly use Amazon\u2019s cloud services. Microsoft denies providing cloud services to Chinese surveillance firms, and OpenAI states it adheres to Microsoft\u2019s cloud policies and does not work with Chinese companies. The report highlights that U.S. sanctions after Tiananmen did not cover modern surveillance technologies such as facial recognition, smart cameras, or surveillance software. Between 2006 and 2013, five attempts by lawmakers to close these loopholes failed due to bureaucratic obstacles. A notable example is the 2008 Commerce Department effort to update sanctions to include biometric sensors, which stalled until a new administration took office. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) argues that all tech companies possess vast wealth, which is the common factor behind the failure to update export laws.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 10:54 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/tech/2025/10/30/%d9%83%d9%8a%d9%81-%d8%b3%d9%85%d8%ad%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%88%d9%85%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%b1%d9%83%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%a8%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%b9)\n\n**Nvidia's Blackwell Chips: From Commercial Product to Diplomatic Leverage in U.S.-China Talks**\nNvidia's Blackwell AI chips have transitioned from a commercial product to a key diplomatic tool in U.S.-China relations. The U.S. has imposed export restrictions on Blackwell-class processors to prevent China from accessing the computational power needed to train frontier AI models. Blackwell, Nvidia's next-generation AI accelerator, features 208 billion transistors\u2014over 2.5 times more than its predecessor H100\u2014and delivers up to 20 petaflops FP4 performance. It enables massive AI model training across clusters of up to 576 GPUs, with 2.5x faster training and up to 5x faster inference than Hopper. The chip\u2019s fifth-gen NVLink and Transformer Engine support FP4 precision, doubling model size and efficiency while maintaining accuracy. U.S. officials argue that access to advanced computing equals national AI capacity, which directly translates to military modernization potential. The chip's geopolitical significance is underscored by Wall Street's reaction: Nvidia\u2019s stock rose 5% on October 28, 2024, hitting a record $201.03 per share, with market cap reaching $4.89 trillion. Analysts at HSBC set a $320 price target (nearly 60% upside), while Wells Fargo raised its target to $220, citing potential resumption of sales to China. Nvidia\u2019s China revenue dropped from 95% to zero after Beijing banned domestic firms from buying even the downgraded H20 chips. If President Donald Trump grants export approval for Blackwell or a rumored variant like B30A, Nvidia could unlock billions in quarterly revenue and strengthen dominance over Chinese cloud providers and AI startups. However, bipartisan opposition in Congress views loosening export controls as a national security threat. Market attention will focus on any statements from Trump or Xi regarding export cuts, licensing frameworks, or timelines. References to 'technology cooperation' or 'phased access' to advanced semiconductors in the joint communique would immediately trigger market revaluation of Nvidia.\nOriginal language: da-DK\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Invezz - Danish](https://invezz.com/da/nyheder/2025/10/29/nvidia-blackwell-i-trump-xi-forhandlinger-wall-streets-besaettelse-blev-bare-diplomati/)\n\n**U.S. Allows Companies to Sell Surveillance-Enabling Technology to China Despite Security Concerns**\nDespite repeated attempts by U.S. Congress members since September 2024 to close a loophole allowing China to circumvent U.S. export bans on advanced AI chips by leasing them through American cloud computing services, these efforts have failed in four separate attempts. Over 100 technology industry groups and trade associations lobbied against restrictions, contributing to congressional inaction. As U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping prepare for a long-awaited meeting, the issue of American companies selling advanced technology to China remains highly contentious, threatening billions in economic value and U.S. technological dominance. While Washington has repeatedly warned Beijing about national security and human rights violations, U.S. governments\u2014across five Republican and Democratic administrations\u2014have repeatedly permitted, and even actively facilitated, the sale of American technology to Chinese police, government agencies, and surveillance firms. Despite export regulations on advanced chips, China purchased $20.7 billion worth of semiconductor manufacturing equipment from U.S. companies in 2024, according to a recent congressional report. The U.S. technology sector\u2019s immense wealth and influence\u2014particularly under the Trump administration\u2014has hindered decisive action. In August 2025, Trump announced a deal with NVIDIA and AMD to lift export restrictions on advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% government revenue share. In the same month, the U.S. government acquired a 10% stake in Intel for approximately $11 billion, further entangling American fiscal interests with technology exports to China.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 03:30 PM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/aswaq/economy/2025/10/29/%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%AD-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86)\n\n**Nvidia's Blackwell Chip: From Wall Street Obsession to Diplomatic Flashpoint in Trump-Xi Talks**\nNvidia's Blackwell AI chip has become a central diplomatic issue ahead of the upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Originally a corporate product launch, Blackwell has evolved into a geopolitical tool, as the U.S. has imposed export restrictions on Blackwell processors to prevent China from accessing advanced computing power needed for cutting-edge AI model training. Blackwell, Nvidia's next-generation AI accelerator, features 208 billion transistors\u2014over 2.5 times more than the H100 Hopper\u2014and delivers up to 20 petaflops of FP4 computing in a single unified GPU, with fifth-generation NVLink offering 1.8 TB/s bidirectional bandwidth. It enables training of billion-parameter models across clusters of up to 576 GPUs, offering 2.5x faster training and up to 5x faster inference than Hopper. The U.S. justifies restrictions by arguing that access to high-performance computing equates to national AI capability, which directly impacts military modernization. Wall Street's obsession with Nvidia has turned Blackwell into a multibillion-dollar market variable: Nvidia's stock surged 5% on October 28, 2024, reaching a record $201.03, with a market cap of $4.89 trillion. HSBC and Wells Fargo raised price targets, citing potential recovery in Chinese sales. However, Chinese revenues dropped from 95% to zero after Beijing discouraged purchases of even the H20 chips designed to comply with export limits. If Trump approves Blackwell exports\u2014or a declassified variant like the rumored B30A\u2014Nvidia could unlock billions in quarterly revenue and expand dominance over Chinese cloud providers and AI startups. Yet bipartisan opposition in Congress warns that easing export controls threatens national security. Market watchers will monitor any mention of export exemptions, licensing frameworks, or delayed access to Blackwell-class chips in the joint statement. References to 'technological cooperation' or 'gradual access' to advanced semiconductors would trigger an immediate market reassessment of Nvidia.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 10:39 AM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/fr/actualites/2025/10/29/nvidia-blackwell-dans-les-pourparlers-trump-xi-lobsession-de-wall-street-vient-de-devenir-la-diplomatie/)\n\n**Nvidia Blackwell Chips in Trump-Xi Talks: Wall Street's Obsession Turns into Diplomacy**\nNvidia's Blackwell AI chips have transitioned from a commercial product launch to a central diplomatic issue in the upcoming U.S.-China summit between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea.

Huang argues that access to China's $50 billion annual AI chip market is essential for funding U.S. R&D, warning that exclusion harms Nvidia long-term. Nvidia's China revenue plummeted from 95% to 0% after Beijing banned domestic firms from buying even discounted H20 chips designed to comply with export controls. If Trump grants export licenses for Blackwell or a reduced version like the rumored B30A, Nvidia could unlock billions in quarterly revenue and strengthen its dominance among Chinese cloud providers and AI startups. However, political backlash is significant: both Republican and Democratic members of Congress oppose loosening export controls, framing advanced chip sales to China as a national security threat. Market reactions will closely follow any statements from Trump or Xi regarding 'technology cooperation,' 'phased access,' or licensing timelines. Any hint of eased restrictions will prompt immediate revaluation of Nvidia's stock.\nOriginal language: fi\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[Invezz - Finnish](https://invezz.com/fi/uutiset/2025/10/29/nvidia-blackwell-trumpin-ja-xin-neuvotteluissa-wall-streetin-pakkomielteesta-tuli-juuri-diplomatiaa/)\n\n**U.S. Allows Companies to Sell Surveillance-Enabling Technology to China Despite Security Concerns**\nDespite repeated attempts by U.S. Congress members since September 2024 to close a loophole allowing China to circumvent U.S. export bans on advanced AI chips by leasing them through American cloud computing services, these efforts have failed in four separate attempts. Over 100 technology industry groups and trade associations lobbied against restrictions, contributing to congressional inaction. As U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping prepare for a long-awaited meeting, the issue of American companies selling advanced technology to China remains highly contentious, threatening billions in economic value and U.S. technological dominance. While Washington has repeatedly warned Beijing about national security and human rights violations, U.S. governments\u2014across five Republican and Democratic administrations\u2014have repeatedly permitted, and even actively facilitated, the sale of American technology to Chinese police, government agencies, and surveillance firms. Despite export regulations on advanced chips, China purchased $20.7 billion worth of semiconductor manufacturing equipment from U.S. companies in 2024, according to a recent congressional report. The U.S. technology sector\u2019s immense wealth and influence\u2014particularly under the Trump administration\u2014has hindered decisive action. In August 2025, Trump announced a deal with NVIDIA and AMD to lift export restrictions on advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% government revenue share. In the same month, the U.S. government acquired a 10% stake in Intel for approximately $11 billion, further entangling American fiscal interests with technology exports to China.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 03:30 PM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/aswaq/economy/2025/10/29/%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%AD-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86)\n\n**Nvidia's Blackwell Chips at the Heart of Trump-Xi Diplomacy: From Market Power to Geopolitical Leverage**\nNvidia's Blackwell AI chips have become a central diplomatic issue in the upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, shifting from a commercial product launch to a geopolitical instrument.

NVIDIA released a three-minute video, for the first time showcasing the entire U.S.-based production chain: TSMC\u2019s Arizona wafer fabrication, Foxconn\u2019s assembly plants in California and Texas, and Siliconware\u2019s advanced CoWoS packaging line. Huang stated that demand for Blackwell GPUs is so strong that NVIDIA expects revenue from Blackwell and early Rubin chips to exceed $500 billion (approximately 15 trillion TWD) in 2026\u2014more than five times the total lifetime revenue of the Hopper chip. He noted that 6 million GPUs were sold in the first three quarters of 2025, with an additional 20 million to be delivered from Q4 2025 to Q4 2026. This growth is driven by massive capital expenditures from major CSPs (cloud service providers) such as CoreWeave, Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle, which are projected to increase by 60% in 2025, 23% in 2026, and double 2024 levels, with a further 15% rise in 2027. Huang thanked supply chain partners, emphasizing that 'we are producing again in America,' fulfilling Trump\u2019s initial request for national security and job creation. Foxconn Chairman Liu Yang-wei, speaking before Huang\u2019s talk, confirmed that Foxconn is building factories in Ohio, Texas, Wisconsin, and California, positioning this era as 'Industry 5.0' driven by AI. Foxconn also announced a board-approved budget of up to 42 billion TWD over the next year to invest in AI computing clusters and supercomputing centers, accelerating the development of its three smart platforms.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 11:28 PM\nSource:[businesstoday.com.tw](https://www.businesstoday.com.tw/article/category/183015/post/202510290002/)\n\n**Americans Impose Restrictions.

Taiwan\u2019s authorities accuse 11 Chinese companies of establishing shell companies on the island to evade U.S. economic sanctions and hire technology professionals; among them is SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation), a major Chinese chipmaker. Additionally, Chinese authorities have reportedly begun rejecting Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip, a slower version of the banned H100, due to suspicions that it may contain U.S.-installed espionage mechanisms\u2014claims Nvidia has strongly denied.

However, non-controlled segments like consumer GPUs and automotive chips remain operational, contributing $2.769 billion in China region revenue during Q2 of fiscal year 2026, or about 6% of total revenue. CEO Jensen Huang stated in a New York event: 'We have 100% exited the Chinese market for high-end chips,' and added that U.S. policy caused the loss of one of the world\u2019s largest markets. The U.S. export restrictions escalated from banning A100/H100 in 2022, to restricting the special H20 version in 2024, and ultimately imposing an indefinite suspension of H20 sales in April 2025\u2014resulting in $4.5 billion in stranded inventory and $8 billion in lost potential revenue. This has accelerated China\u2019s domestic chip substitution: Huawei's Ascend 910B matches H20 performance and is 20% cheaper; Cambrian AI and Biren have increased their market share from under 30% to 40% within two years, with domestic chips accounting for over 60% of procurement in government and state-owned enterprise projects. NVIDIA has suffered significant setbacks: H20 sales in China reached $0 in 2025, with data center revenue falling short of expectations for two consecutive quarters. The company has lost access to the world\u2019s largest AI application environment and critical feedback for technological iteration. The U.S. Semiconductor Association warned that decoupling could cost American firms over one-third of their revenue. Huang cautioned: 'Harming China often harms the U.S. more,' noting that 50% of global AI researchers are based in China, and technological isolation slows global progress. China\u2019s tech ecosystem has advanced: Huawei Ascend achieved H100-level performance via dual-chip packaging; SMIC\u2019s 12-inch wafer yield reached 95%; Yangtze Memory\u2019s 294-layer flash memory holds 8% global market share. Ecosystems are reconfiguring: Alibaba and Tencent are shifting to domestic chips; Huawei Ascend has begun exporting to Malaysia. China\u2019s AI server chip domestic share is projected to reach 40% by 2025. NVIDIA is developing compliant chips like Blackwell B30A, but approval from the U.S. government is required, and it faces growing competition from domestically advanced chips. The blockade has acted as a catalyst for China\u2019s chip industry: domestic AI chip sales surged by $16 billion in 2025, growing at three times the rate of international vendors. Huang urges a return to 'first principles'\u2014balancing technological leadership with global cooperation to avoid zero-sum outcomes.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 07:49 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7096020433_v1a6f4add106801e8mi.html?from=tech)\n\n**The risks of export controls on AI chips**\nUS export controls on advanced AI chips, particularly those from Nvidia and AMD, have fundamentally reshaped semiconductor design and global supply chains. Since 2018, the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has imposed strict limits on performance, memory bandwidth, and interconnect speeds to restrict China\u2019s access to cutting-edge AI hardware. These regulations led to the creation of downgraded, export-compliant variants such as the Nvidia A800 (400 GBps interconnect bandwidth vs. 600 GBps on the A100), H800 (300 GBps vs. 900 GBps on the H100), and later the H20, which met updated 2023 performance and density caps. These chips were intentionally crippled via firmware, clock adjustments, and reduced memory speeds\u2014turning engineering into compliance. The policy has driven Chinese companies like Huawei to surge in demand for their Ascend 910 series, while European stakeholders, alarmed by US restrictions\u2014including proposed 2025 rules that would have extended export limits to EU allies\u2014began planning to de-Americanize their supply chains. Although the US withdrew the controversial 'AI Diffusion Rule' in mid-2025 and resumed limited sales of H20 and AMD MI308 to China under special licenses, the long-term consequences include fractured global trust, accelerated development of rival ecosystems, and a shift in R&D investment from US firms to Chinese competitors. The result is a paradox: policies meant to maintain technological dominance may instead be fueling innovation in rival nations, undermining long-term US leverage. As one analysis notes, 'When policy, rather than physics, dictates chip specifications, innovation suffers.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 01:24 PM\nSource:[TheRegister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/the_risks_of_export_controls/)\n\n**Chinese Counterattack in AI Chip War | UDN**\nThe article explains how the U.S. Biden administration\u2019s 2023 export\u2011control regulations targeted Nvidia\u2019s H20 AI accelerator for the Chinese market. In April 2023 the Trump administration banned Nvidia from selling H20 to China, but in July the policy was relaxed, allowing imports. Chinese authorities, citing cybersecurity, then actively discouraged domestic firms from buying H20, tightening its sales and forcing Nvidia to slow production. Nvidia responded by downgrading existing GPUs and launching A800 (a lower\u2011spec version of the A100) and H800 (a lower\u2011spec version of the H100). The H20, however, slipped through the ban because its compute performance was below the threshold while its communication bandwidth exceeded it, making it a loophole in the U.S. policy that was only closed in April 2024. The piece notes that large\u2011language\u2011model (LLM) training relies heavily on data\u2011access throughput, so H20\u2019s overall performance can surpass other banned accelerators. Nvidia has also introduced GPUs with high\u2011bandwidth memory (HBM) and NVLink interconnects to mitigate memory\u2011access bottlenecks for LLMs. Chinese AI\u2011accelerator companies, lacking the latest semiconductor processes, typically have slower compute and higher power consumption; they compensate by scaling GPU count and enhancing inter\u2011GPU communication. Huawei\u2019s CloudMatrix\u202f384 exemplifies this strategy: it uses a unified interconnect of optical links and electronic switches, allowing each compute unit to access any memory in the system dynamically. Although CloudMatrix\u202f384\u2019s performance and cost\u2011effectiveness still lag behind Nvidia\u2019s newest products, it is roughly on par with the same tier and could eventually compete in the Chinese market. The article cites the Chinese government\u2019s past success in scaling industries such as solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, suggesting that Huawei\u2019s AI super\u2011computing system may eventually match Nvidia in China.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 04:04 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/7340/9007114)\n\n**Alibaba and Baidu Deploy Their Own AI Chips Amid US Export Restrictions**\nAlibaba and Baidu have begun using their own AI chips\u2014Alibaba's 'Zhenwu' and Baidu's 'Kunlun P800'\u2014to train small\u2011to\u2011medium models and large language models such as ERNIE. According to the IT media 'The Information', Zhenwu, launched early this year, matches Nvidia's H20 chip in performance and a newer version reportedly outperforms the older A100. Baidu's Kunlun P800 is being used for training and inference of ERNIE. Both companies still rely on Nvidia GPUs for cutting\u2011edge model development because their domestic chips are not yet on par with the latest Nvidia GPUs. Production of Zhenwu moved from Taiwan's TSMC to China's SMIC after US export restrictions tightened, a shift that reflects the broader push for semiconductor self\u2011reliance. Baidu's manufacturing partner remains unclear, but domestic production is likely. Analysts view the shift as a structural transformation of China's AI industry, accelerated by US export controls and supported by government policy. The article also recalls the 2018 US designation of Huawei as a national security threat, the subsequent sanctions that halted Google Android support, TSMC chip supply, and access to US semiconductors and equipment. Huawei's response\u2014its 'Spare Tire' strategy, the Hubble investment fund, and the 2023 launch of the Mate 60 Pro powered by SMIC's 7nm chip\u2014demonstrated that sanctions can spur domestic innovation. The article concludes that China will likely continue a hybrid strategy of using both domestic and Nvidia chips for the foreseeable future.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 01:18 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/11418536)\n\n**Chinese Firms Turn to Used Nvidia GPUs Following Beijing H20 Crackdown**\nChina\u2019s AI sector is increasingly turning to refurbished Nvidia GPUs after the H20 accelerator was effectively banned in July 2025. The H20, a Hopper\u2011based chip designed to meet U.S. export restrictions, was pulled from the market when Chinese regulators cited data\u2011security concerns, leaving firms scrambling for alternatives. According to a Digitimes report, demand for older A100 and H100 cards has surged as companies strip them down and reconfigure them into low\u2011cost, high\u2011performance inference systems.\n\nThe A100, launched in 2020 on the Ampere architecture, offers up to 80\u202fGB of HBM2e memory and 2\u202fTBps bandwidth. Despite lacking Hopper\u2019s peak throughput, its large memory pool and mature CUDA ecosystem keep it valuable for inference workloads such as chatbots and recommendation engines. The H100, released in 2022, delivers HBM3 memory and up to six times the AI training throughput of an A100. In contrast, the H20 was tuned for inference but was cut back so aggressively that it delivers between three and nearly seven times less AI performance than a full H100, and more than thirty times slower in FP64 supercomputing tasks.\n\nBecause inference is less compute\u2011intensive than training, models can run efficiently on trimmed or reconfigured hardware, making even an A100 attractive to Chinese buyers. China\u2019s data centers are willing to pay for refurbished boards, accepting lower reliability for round\u2011the\u2011clock operation.\n\nNvidia\u2019s position is complicated: the company took a $5.5\u202fbillion write\u2011down on unsold H20 inventory when Washington introduced licensing requirements for its export to China. Yet its GPUs continue to dominate China\u2019s AI boom, creating a gray\u2011market channel that could erode margins and slow adoption of newer architectures.\n\nThe gray market also poses a challenge for Beijing, which wants domestic firms like Huawei and Biren to scale. Each second\u2011hand, stripped\u2011down H100 installed in a Chinese data center represents a system not running on Ascend accelerators, potentially slowing domestic investment.\n\nUltimately, the recycling economy illustrates the unintended consequences of tightening export controls. U.S. policymakers hoped to throttle China\u2019s access to cutting\u2011edge compute, while Beijing sought to accelerate homegrown silicon adoption. Instead, yesterday\u2019s A100s and H100s continue to power tomorrow\u2019s AI deployments, showing a pragmatic extension of older hardware while waiting for political and technological roadblocks to clear.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 27, 2025 01:14 PM\nSource:[Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/china-repurposes-used-nvidia-gpus)\n\n**U.S. Sanctions Push Nvidia to Suspend H20 GPU Supply to China**\nThe article reports that Nvidia\u2019s H20 graphics chip, designed for the Chinese market, is facing a supply\u2011chain halt after U.S. sanctions prompted the company to ask its partners to suspend work. Amkor Technology (packaging), Samsung (memory) and Foxconn (back\u2011end assembly) were all told to stop H20 production for China, according to the Information and Reuters. The U.S. added export rules in April that required a license for the H20, and in July the Biden administration relaxed those restrictions only in exchange for a deal that lets the U.S. capture part of Nvidia\u2019s revenue from Chinese sales. Nvidia has not confirmed a production stop but said it is managing its supply chain to adapt to the new conditions. The H20 was intended as a workaround to continue selling GPUs in China after earlier bans on high\u2011performance chips such as the A100 and H100; it was built with reduced specifications to meet U.S. export thresholds while still delivering solid AI performance. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has advised state agencies and security\u2011related companies not to adopt the H20, a stance reportedly influenced by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick\u2019s comment that the U.S. does not sell \"even its third\u2011best products\" to China. These remarks have frustrated Beijing officials and may have contributed to the reluctance to use the chip. The article notes that even if U.S. restrictions were lifted, Chinese customers may already be seeking alternatives from domestic makers or other suppliers that can bypass U.S. controls. The situation illustrates how advanced semiconductor technology is increasingly entangled with geopolitics, with chips like the H20 becoming tools of national strategy and export policy. Nvidia\u2019s future with the H20 remains uncertain, as supplier suspensions could undermine the chip\u2019s rollout and drive Chinese firms to accelerate domestic accelerator development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 06:25 AM\nSource:[Guru3D.com](https://www.guru3d.com/story/us-sanctions-push-nvidia-to-suspend-h20-gpu-supply-to-china/)\n\n**US Semiconductor Export Controls Test Taiwanese Manufacturers' Adaptability**\nUS semiconductor export controls have fluctuated since the Trump administration, affecting Taiwanese manufacturers. The Commerce Department announced in August\u202f2022 a set of controls targeting Chinese advanced chip design, manufacturing equipment, and product sales to curb AI computing for military use. In October\u202f2023 a second round tightened rules on high\u2011performance computing chips and advanced process equipment. December\u202f2024 saw a third round adding controls on advanced DRAM memory defined by memory\u2011unit area and storage capacity per unit area, limiting China to 18\u202fnm or larger processes for high\u2011capacity advanced DRAM, and including high\u2011bandwidth memory (HBM) in the advanced computing chip standard configuration. In January\u202f2025 the department added 16 Chinese and Singaporean companies to its entity list, including two Singapore firms\u2014\u7b97\u80fd\u79d1\u6280 and PowerAir\u2014that had supplied TSMC\u2011manufactured chips to Huawei, prompting TSMC to halt supply. NVIDIA\u2019s FY\u202f2025 Q3 revenue from Singapore was $7.7\u202fbillion, 18% of its $35.1\u202fbillion total, indicating many Singapore\u2011based customers were buying GPUs and AI servers, yet only about 1\u20132% of those chips actually entered Singapore before being re\u2011exported to China and elsewhere. The US revoked the AI diffusion rules in May\u202f2024, citing pressure from NVIDIA and AMD that the rules would hurt US chipmakers\u2019 global profits. The same month it imposed EDA\u2011tool restrictions on China, but after June\u202f2024 US\u2011China talks the restriction was lifted. The article notes that the fluctuating controls create uncertainty for exporters and allies, and warns Taiwanese fabs to strengthen due\u2011diligence and avoid complacency to prevent end products from reaching controlled entities.

According to the US Department of Justice, the two men, aged 28, used a company in California to export the chips, including NVIDIA's H100 GPU, which is used for creating and running AI software. The chips require approval from the US government to be sold to certain countries. NVIDIA stated, 'This case shows that smuggling is not an option.' The company also said that its products are mainly sold to well-known partners, 'who help us ensure that all sales comply with US export control regulations.' NVIDIA added, 'Even smaller exporters and shipments are subject to thorough review and careful examination, and any transferred products will not receive any service, support, or updates.' The US has tightened restrictions on the export of semiconductors and chip manufacturing equipment in recent years to slow China's progress in the AI field. The Trump administration is exploring adding enhanced location tracking features to AI chips to help enforce export controls. The H100 series was considered the most powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) before being replaced by a new product from NVIDIA. The export of H100 series to China and other countries deemed a national security threat by the US requires approval from the US Commerce Department, which rarely issues such permits.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 06, 2025 08:28 AM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B/20250806-%E5%85%A9%E5%90%8D%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E4%BA%BA%E5%9B%A0%E5%9C%A8%E7%BE%8E%E9%9D%9E%E6%B3%95%E5%90%91%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E9%81%8B%E9%80%81%E8%8B%B1%E5%81%89%E9%81%94ai%E8%8A%AF%E7%89%87%E8%A2%AB%E8%B5%B7%E8%A8%B4)\n\n**US Temporarily Relaxes Export Controls on Advanced Chips to China**\nThe US has temporarily relaxed its export controls on advanced chips to China, according to a report by the Financial Times (FT). The move is aimed at avoiding interference with Beijing's trade talks and facilitating a meeting between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year. The report cites current and former officials as saying that the US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security has received instructions to avoid taking tough measures against China. High-level US and Chinese economic officials met in Stockholm on July 28-29 to discuss long-standing economic disputes between the two nations. Trump reportedly wants to avoid taking actions that could impact his meeting with Xi, but some officials believe that the US is being constrained by export controls, which could be countered by China's restrictions on the export of critical rare earth and magnetic materials. In May, China made its first move in this regard. NVIDIA, a leading chip manufacturer, has already announced that it will resume selling its H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to China, reversing a ban imposed by the Trump administration in April. The US had originally prohibited the export of advanced AI chips to China on national security grounds. However, a group of 20 security experts and former officials, including former White House Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger, have expressed concerns about the move in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. The letter states, 'This is a strategic mistake that will imperil US economic and military advantages in AI.' Experts note that the H20 chip is 'capable of significantly accelerating China's advanced AI capabilities' and performs better in 'inference' (executing AI functions, rather than training models) than the banned H100 chip, which will help China develop autonomous weapons systems, intelligence monitoring platforms, and other military technologies.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: July 28, 2025 06:55 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5603/8902462)\n\n**Commerce announces new export control on US AI products**\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce, under Secretary Gina Raimondo, announced new export controls on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on January 13, 2025. The rule, aimed at securing U.S. dominance in AI innovation and protecting national security, imposes licensing requirements on AI chips\u2014particularly advanced GPU computing chips\u2014and closed-source AI model weights trained with 10^26 or more computational operations. The controls restrict exports to adversarial nations while allowing allied countries such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the UK, and others to access U.S. AI innovation. The rule introduces two types of Data Center Validated End User (VEU) programs: universal VEUs for U.S. and allied entities, and national VEUs for non-embargoed countries. Supply chain activities like packaging and testing are excluded from new controls, but advanced computing chip exports require new authorizations. A new foreign direct product rule applies to closed AI model weights produced abroad using U.S.-origin technology. Open-weight models remain exempt. The rule includes security conditions for storing advanced AI models and compute clusters. A 120-day public comment period precedes a one-year compliance period. Raimondo acknowledged the rule may be revised by the incoming Trump administration, noting that feedback will be considered. A senior administration official stated that lower-volume chip orders (under 1,700 processing units) will no longer require licenses but will involve notification to prevent diversion to countries of concern. The rule targets countries including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and others under arms embargoes. NVIDIA\u2019s Vice President of Government Affairs Ned Finkle criticized the rule as a '200+ page regulatory morass' that risks stifling innovation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 03:42 PM\nSource:[nextgov.com](https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2025/01/commerce-announces-new-export-control-us-ai-products/402131/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014spanning government technology policy, critical infrastructure, legislative analysis, political science, law, and science and technology studies\u2014there is near-unanimous agreement that the probability of the US requiring purchasers of large numbers of GPUs to report their usage before 2026 is extremely low. Experts cite consistent factors: (1) intense industry lobbying and sectoral resistance have repeatedly stalled or blocked attempts at expanding regulatory control beyond export measures; (2) the US regulatory and legislative process is slow, with a strong base rate of inertia and a lack of precedent for rapid, sweeping domestic usage-reporting mandates; (3) existing and recent regulations (notably the January 2025 Commerce rule) focus on exports, not domestic use, and include long compliance windows; (4) the political climate, especially under the Trump administration, prioritizes economic competitiveness, industry profit-sharing, and stability over new compliance burdens; and (5) technical and administrative barriers further hinder the rapid rollout of meaningful usage-monitoring infrastructure. While experts acknowledge a small possibility of a sudden national security crisis prompting emergency action, the current evidence, news, and policy direction show no such trigger or movement. Probability estimates range from 2% to 7%, with most clustered at or below 5%. Therefore, the expert consensus is that a legal reporting requirement for large GPU purchases and usage will not be enacted and enforced by the end-of-2025 deadline.",
