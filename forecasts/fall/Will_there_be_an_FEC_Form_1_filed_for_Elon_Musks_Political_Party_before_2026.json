The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAssociated Press via NPR (July 6, 2025): [Musk forms new party after split with Trump over tax and spending bill](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/06/g-s1-76292/musk-political-party-america)\n\n> Elon Musk said he's carrying out his threat to form a new political party after [his fissure with President Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/article/trump-musk-tax-bill-6e7845081259c34db785182c51569c0c), announcing the America Party in response to the president's sweeping tax cuts law.\n\n> The formation of new political parties is not uncommon, but they typically struggle to pull any significant support away from the Republican and Democratic parties. But Musk, the world's richest man who spent at least \\$250 million supporting Trump in the 2024 election, could impact the 2026 elections determining control of Congress if he is willing to spend significant amounts of money.\n\n> It wasn't clear whether Musk had taken steps to formally create the new political party. Spokespeople for Musk and his political action committee, America PAC, didn't immediately comment Sunday.\n> \u200e\n> As of Sunday morning, there were multiple political parties listed in the Federal Election Commission database that had been formed in the the hours since Musk's Saturday X post with versions of \"America Party\" of \"DOGE\" or \"X\" in the name, or Musk listed among people affiliated with the entity. But none appeared to be authentic, listing contacts for the organization as email addresses such as \"wentsnowboarding \\[at] yahoo.com\u2033 or untraceable Protonmail addresses.\n\nA purported Form 1 filing of the America Party on July 6, 2025 [was reported](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1942009499109536185?s=46) by Elon Musk to be false.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38822,\"question_id\":38143}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2026, a Form 1 \"Statement of Organization\" is filed with the US [Federal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/data/filings/?data_type=processed) for any Elon Musk-founded political party, such as the [America Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Party).",
        "fine_print": "If any political party under a different name than the America Party is founded or co-founded by Musk and files a Form 1 after July 6, 2025 and before January 1, 2026, this question will resolve as **Yes**.\n\nIf there are any ambiguities over whether a Form 1 filing has occurred (such as scenarios in which the authenticity of a filing is in doubt), Metaculus may refer to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) to verify the truth of the matter.&#x20;\n\nForm 1 filings will only resolve this question if Musk is a founder or co-founder of the party, according to credible sources.

This comes amid electoral defeats driven by voter concerns over affordability, prompting emergency meetings in the West Wing. The White House has responded with a second reconciliation bill addressing both health care costs and Donald Trump\u2019s contested tariff policies, currently under review by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a preliminary National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report reveals that the left wing of a UPS cargo plane involved in a November 4, 2025, crash near Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, had fatigue cracks and signs of overstress. The crash killed 14 people, including three crew members, and injured 23; the NTSB confirmed that the left engine and pylon detached during takeoff, with a 'repeating bell' heard seconds before impact. The investigation remains ongoing. In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed he has agreed to work on a U.S.-drafted peace plan aimed at ending Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, which has entered its fourth year. The 28-point proposal, modeled on the Gaza ceasefire, is being developed in coordination with U.S. officials, with Zelenskyy expected to discuss it with President Donald Trump soon. Finally, UNICEF reported that 417 million children in low- and middle-income countries face severe deprivation in education, health, and nutrition, with sub-Saharan Africa most affected, followed by South and East Asia and the Pacific. While progress has been made this century, funding cuts to development and humanitarian aid, along with climate change and conflict, threaten to reverse gains. Of these, 412 million children live on less than $3 per day, though this metric only captures part of the full scope of deprivation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 01:14 AM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3926681)\n\n**Ossoff\u2019s Billionaire Donors Expose Hypocrisy of Democratic Senator Criticizing Political Corruption**\nSenator Jon Ossoff, a vulnerable Democratic candidate running for re-election in 2026, has publicly criticized the influence of corporate and billionaire money in U.S. politics, calling it the root cause of congressional failure to serve ordinary Americans. In a 2019 statement and on the left-leaning podcast 'Pod Save America,' Ossoff denounced the impact of 'rich political donors' and blamed the Citizens United decision for enabling secret, unlimited political spending. However, Federal Election Commission (FEC) records analyzed by Fox News Digital reveal that Ossoff has received nearly half a million dollars from billionaires since 2017, including over $154,000 in 2024 alone. Major contributors include Eric Schmidt, Reid Hoffman, James Cox-Chambers, Henry Laufer, and members of the Soros family. Despite claiming to reject PAC corporate money, Open Secrets data shows significant contributions from individuals linked to Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. Additionally, Ossoff received thousands from PACs representing law firms, lobbying groups, agribusiness, and unions. His campaign claims to be driven by small donors\u2014averaging $36 from about 233,000 contributors\u2014but over 80% of funds came from outside Georgia, with top donors from California, New York, and the D.C.-Virginia area. Ossoff declined to respond to inquiries about the discrepancy. He is described by CNN as the 'most threatened Democratic senator' and has positioned himself as a champion of a 'popular coalition' despite accepting substantial support from wealthy donors, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, whose net worth exceeds $3.5 billion. Ossoff narrowly defeated Republican David Perdue in a 2020 runoff election and now faces re-election in a state Trump won in 2024 by a two-point margin.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 10:45 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/registros-desenterrados-fec-exponen-hipocres%C3%ADa-224504765.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Reunites With Donald Trump After Month, Makes Official Appearance At U.S. State Dinner**\nElon Musk made his first public appearance at a U.S. State Dinner at the White House on November 20, 2025, marking a significant reconciliation with Donald Trump after a period of public conflict. The two were seen interacting warmly, with Musk receiving a pat on the stomach upon arrival, signaling a restored relationship. Their rift began in June 2025 when Musk criticized Trump\u2019s 'One Big Beautiful Bill' on X, calling it 'utterly insane' and 'destructive in nature,' citing its potential to destroy millions of jobs and harm future industries. Trump retaliated by threatening to withdraw federal funding from Musk\u2019s companies. Musk further escalated tensions by referencing the Jeffrey Epstein files and announcing plans to form a third political party in July 2025, which could have harmed the Republican base. The first sign of reconciliation occurred at the funeral of assassinated activist Charlie Kirk, where they were photographed in a friendly exchange. The White House later released a monochrome image of the two, suggesting their reunion was intentional. Musk had previously been invited to a White House AI summit hosted by Melania Trump in the renovated Rose Garden, where he clarified he could not attend but sent a representative. At the State Dinner, Musk, dressed in formal attire, engaged with Trump and other dignitaries, including posing for a selfie with football legend Cristiano Ronaldo.

Trump, hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, jokingly asked the audience if Musk had 'ever thanked me for that properly?' In response, Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter): 'I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world.' Trump had previously praised Musk multiple times during the forum, particularly highlighting federal tax deductions that benefit domestic car production, and remarked, 'You are so lucky I'm with you, Elon,' referencing policies that have supported Musk\u2019s ventures. The public reconciliation followed a bitter feud earlier in 2025, when Musk criticized Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans and announced plans to form a new political party, prompting Trump to threaten to withdraw billions in federal subsidies. The two men had previously worked closely, with Musk backing Trump\u2019s 2024 election campaign and briefly leading the Department of Government Efficiency, overseeing federal cost-cutting initiatives. A video from the event showed Trump, Melania Trump, and the Crown Prince spotting Musk and gently tapping him, to which Musk responded with a nod.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 11:09 AM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-does-exactly-what-us-president-donald-trump-asked-him-to-do-on-stage/articleshow/125460465.cms)\n\n**Trump, Elon Musk bromance back on: Inside how the president, mogul ended their nasty feud**\nA significant thaw in the relationship between former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has occurred, marked by public displays of camaraderie such as Trump's three shout-outs to Musk during a speech before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a warm arm-tap at a White House banquet. This reconciliation follows a bitter feud that erupted after Musk criticized Trump\u2019s 2024 One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included tax cuts and other campaign promises, and later threatened to form a third party, the America Party, on July 5, 2025. The d\u00e9tente was facilitated by Vice President JD Vance and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, who served as trusted intermediaries, according to five sources close to the White House. These sources emphasized that Musk values private, candid communication with Vance and Wiles, who have helped restore trust. Musk\u2019s support was further solidified by his $290 million in donations to Republican campaigns in 2024 and his role as unpaid head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from January to May 2025, which Wiles praised as impactful. The reconciliation began with a private conversation at the September 21, 2025, funeral of Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA cofounder, and was reinforced by Musk\u2019s renewed public support for the administration. Despite the improved rapport, a White House official cautioned that the relationship will never return to its former intimacy, stating, 'It\u2019s true they are friendly, but not \u2018friends.\u2019 The president forgives, but he does not forget.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2025 11:42 PM\nSource:[nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/11/19/us-news/bromance-back-on-inside-how-trump-and-elon-musk-ended-their-feud/)\n\n**Republican Legislative Challenges Mount Ahead of 2026 Elections Amid Trump\u2019s Declining Approval and Internal Divisions**\nThe Republican Party faces mounting challenges ahead of the 2026 legislative elections, as Democratic gains in the previous election have set a difficult electoral foundation. President Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to 38%, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey published on November 21, 2025, driven by backlash over tariffs affecting rural voters and immigration enforcement actions impacting Latino communities. Revelations about Trump\u2019s alleged association with Jeffrey Epstein\u2014specifically, having spent 'hours' with a victim and knowing about the child trafficking network\u2014have reignited controversy within the MAGA base. Despite Trump\u2019s attempt to downplay the scandal on Truth Social by emphasizing 'all the victories we\u2019ve achieved,' the bipartisan congressional approval of a law to release remaining Justice Department documents (with only one Republican dissenting) signals deep anxiety among Republicans. This unity reflects growing internal dissent, as Republican lawmakers are breaking party discipline to push for transparency, forcing Trump to concede and promise to sign the bill into law\u2014a reversal from his previous opposition. The fear of losing control of Congress, especially the House (219\u2013214 Republican\u2013Democrat split) and the Senate (53\u201347, with two independent Democrats), threatens to stall Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. Paradoxically, Trump has been inactive in supporting Republican candidates for the upcoming elections, offering only minimal Truth Social endorsements. Meanwhile, Democrats have gained momentum after redrawing electoral maps in California to gain more seats, while a federal judge blocked Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s attempt to redraw districts to gain five additional seats, ruling it 'unconstitutional.' The decision sets a precedent that could affect similar efforts nationwide. Trump has appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court in hopes of a favorable outcome, but the setback in Texas represents a significant blow to Republican electoral strategy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 05:14 AM\nSource:[P\u00fablico.es](https://www.publico.es/internacional/eeuu/elecciones-legislativas-atragantan-republicanos-empezar.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Sends 'Thank You' Note to Trump After He Was Reminded 'You're So Lucky'**\nElon Musk publicly thanked President Donald Trump on X (formerly Twitter) on November 19, 2025, following Trump\u2019s comment during a speech at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, where Trump said, 'You are so lucky I am with you, Elon,' while pointing to Musk. The remark came after Musk had previously criticized Trump\u2019s 'Big Beautiful Bill'\u2014a large government spending plan\u2014as a 'disgusting abomination' and later announced the formation of a new political party, the American Party, in response to its passage. This led to a public rift, with Trump calling Musk a 'train wreck' and accusing him of going 'off the rails.' Despite this, Musk attended Trump\u2019s White House dinner for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on November 18, 2025, and was seen briefly speaking with Trump at a memorial service for right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on September 21, 2025. The New York Times reported on November 18 that a celebration for Musk\u2019s time in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would be held in Austin, with Musk expected to attend.

According to multiple sources within the White House and close to Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles played pivotal roles in reconciling the rift, emphasizing that Musk maintains a direct line of communication with the president and that both officials serve as honest intermediaries. A source close to The Washington Post stated that Wiles and Vance reassured Musk he has a private, trusted channel to express his views, which is essential to the restored trust. Musk has shown interest in reaffirming his support for the administration. The relationship had deteriorated after Musk\u2019s surprise call in June 2024 to remove Trump from office and his announcement of forming a third party, 'America Party,' aimed at challenging Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. This was exacerbated by Trump\u2019s threat to cut federal funding to Musk\u2019s companies, SpaceX and Tesla, and Musk\u2019s claims about Trump\u2019s ties to Jeffrey Epstein. The turning point came after a private meeting between Trump and Musk at the funeral of Charlie Kirk, co-founder of 'Turning Point USA,' who was assassinated in Arizona on September 21, 2024. Further reconciliation followed when Trump\u2019s advisor Dan Scavino reversed a prior decision to withdraw Jared Isaacman\u2019s nomination to lead NASA\u2014a move that had deeply angered Musk. Scavino reportedly viewed this correction as a personal mission. Sources confirm that Musk now trusts Wiles and Vance more than any other individuals in the administration, and that their mediation was crucial in calming tensions. Wiles, described as a behind-the-scenes operator, has historically managed delicate relationship repairs when mutual interests exist. The improved dynamic is attributed to sustained, quiet diplomacy, particularly by Wiles, who has long served as a key facilitator in resolving conflicts within the administration.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 12:05 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645](https://www.emaratalyoum.com/politics/weekly-supplements/beyond-politics/2025-11-21-1.1989949)\n\n**Ossoff\u2019s Billionaire Donors Expose Hypocrisy of Democratic Senator Criticizing Political Corruption**\nSenator Jon Ossoff, a vulnerable Democratic candidate running for re-election in 2026, has publicly criticized the influence of corporate and billionaire money in U.S. politics, calling it the root cause of congressional failure to serve ordinary Americans.

According to lip reader Nicole Hickling, who analyzed video footage of the event, Musk, after taking a sip from his glass, asked Bourla, 'Do you think he is a terrorist?' Bourla was reportedly flustered by the remark. The banquet followed high-level talks in Washington, during which Saudi Arabia agreed to increase its investments in the U.S. economy from $600 billion to $1 trillion and designated the U.S. as its primary strategic partner. The agreement includes plans for Saudi Arabia to purchase 300 Abrams tanks and F-35 fighter-bombers from the U.S., strengthening the American defense industrial base, according to the U.S. president. The incident occurred amid a public feud between Musk and former President Donald Trump, which erupted in summer 2025 over a Republican tax bill that Musk criticized as 'a monstrosity' for increasing the budget deficit. Musk even considered forming a new political party in response. The conflict intensified with mutual accusations\u2014Musk implied Trump\u2019s ties to the Epstein case, while Trump claimed Musk could not have amassed wealth without state support. After emotions cooled, Musk admitted he had gone too far and initiated reconciliation. Though Trump remained distant for a time, a full rapprochement became possible only after Musk returned to the White House days before the banquet.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 08:22 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/news/mask-shokiroval-provokacionnym-voprosom-na-bankete-v-belom-dome-vsjo-objasnila-chtec-po-gubam_1447203)\n\n**Trump, Elon Musk bromance back on: Inside how the president, mogul ended their nasty feud**\nA significant thaw in the relationship between former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has occurred, marked by public displays of camaraderie such as Trump's three shout-outs to Musk during a speech before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a warm arm-tap at a White House banquet. This reconciliation follows a bitter feud that erupted after Musk criticized Trump\u2019s 2024 One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included tax cuts and other campaign promises, and later threatened to form a third party, the America Party, on July 5, 2025. The d\u00e9tente was facilitated by Vice President JD Vance and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, who served as trusted intermediaries, according to five sources close to the White House. These sources emphasized that Musk values private, candid communication with Vance and Wiles, who have helped restore trust. Musk\u2019s support was further solidified by his $290 million in donations to Republican campaigns in 2024 and his role as unpaid head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from January to May 2025, which Wiles praised as impactful. The reconciliation began with a private conversation at the September 21, 2025, funeral of Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA cofounder, and was reinforced by Musk\u2019s renewed public support for the administration. Despite the improved rapport, a White House official cautioned that the relationship will never return to its former intimacy, stating, 'It\u2019s true they are friendly, but not \u2018friends.\u2019 The president forgives, but he does not forget.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2025 11:42 PM\nSource:[nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/11/19/us-news/bromance-back-on-inside-how-trump-and-elon-musk-ended-their-feud/)\n\n**Elon Musk said he'd donate to a GOP congressman that Trump wants to defeat. It hasn't happened yet.**\nElon Musk stated in July 2025 that he would donate to Republican Congressman Thomas Massie\u2019s reelection campaign, following Massie\u2019s opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s 'Big Beautiful Bill'\u2014a stance Musk also supported. However, as of the end of September 2025, no donation from Musk has been disclosed in Massie\u2019s latest Federal Election Commission (FEC) quarterly report, which covers donations from July 1 to September 30. The report lists no contributions from Musk, and neither Musk nor Massie\u2019s campaign has responded to requests for comment. Despite the lack of a financial contribution, Musk\u2019s public support for Massie remains evident, with Massie thanking Musk for 'financial assistance' in a post shortly after Musk\u2019s reply. The race has become a proxy conflict between Musk and Trump, as Trump has openly sought to defeat Massie in a potential 2026 primary. Musk previously announced plans to step back from political donations after spending hundreds of millions on 2024 Republican candidates and to launch a new 'America Party,' though no such party has materialized. Musk has continued to express occasional support for Trump\u2019s actions, including a recent public appearance together at Charlie Kirk\u2019s memorial service.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/elon-musk-said-hed-donate-162007175.html)\n\n**Elon Musk's High-Tech Communication Path: Technological Vision Reshaping Political Discourse**\nElon Musk, known for his \"founder mode\", has repeatedly poured intense effort into ventures such as the acquisition of Twitter (now X), Tesla, and his support for Trump in 2024. In early 2025, he also invested heavily in the newly created Department of Government Efficiency established by executive order on Jan\u202f20\u202f2025, until his resignation at the end of May. On June\u202f5\u202f2025, Musk asked his X followers: '\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u8be5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63\u4ee3\u8868\u4e2d\u95f480%\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u653f\u515a\u4e86\uff1f' The poll attracted more than 5\u202fmillion participants, with 80\u202f% voting in favor, indicating significant public interest in an alternative to the two\u2011party system. A month later, after the passage of the \"Great and Beautiful Act\", Musk expressed anger and announced plans to form a new U.S. party, but a month later he had taken no formal steps and had not mentioned the idea for weeks. Forming a new party in the U.S. requires filing with the Federal Election Commission, collecting signatures on state ballots, and recruiting candidates for the 2026 House and Senate races; there is currently no evidence Musk has begun this process. Musk\u2019s political role has grown, especially after the $44\u202fbillion purchase of Twitter and his involvement in Trump\u2019s second administration. As a multi\u2011company owner, he shifted from donating to Democratic candidates to supporting Republicans, including Trump. His stance is often described as far\u2011right libertarian, and he has faced criticism for views on COVID\u201119 and climate change. He is also known as an 'absolute advocate of free speech', a position that has sparked controversy due to misinformation and hate speech on X.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 11:56 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250929/48869896.html)\n\n**USA: Elon Musk Is Unusually Restraint \u2013 This Has a Reason**\nThe article reports that Elon Musk, once a close ally of former President Donald Trump, has become unusually restrained and reportedly shelved plans to launch an \"America Party\". It claims Musk invested $300\u202fmillion in Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, lived in Pennsylvania for a month to win swing voters, and helped Trump win those states. After Trump\u2019s victory, Musk allegedly became head of the federal \"Efficiency Agency\" (DOGE), fired thousands of federal employees, and claimed he could cut the budget deficit by $2\u202ftrillion. Musk\u2019s frustration with Trump\u2019s new tax bill, which ended electric\u2011vehicle tax credits, led him to post on X that Trump\u2019s name appeared on the infamous \u201cEpstein list\u201d. The article states that on July\u202f4, 2024 Musk announced the America Party, whose mission is to give voters a voice and pursue \u201cjustice over established interests, innovation over bureaucracy, and responsible fiscal policy over frivolous spending\u201d. However, it notes that the party has not been registered with the Federal Election Commission or any state, and Musk has not funded it as promised, leaving it merely a concept. The piece also claims Musk is a close friend of Republican vice\u2011presidential candidate JD\u202fVance, and that his political ambitions threaten the Republican base. The article\u2019s tone is sensational, presenting unverified claims and political gossip without clear sources, aiming to provoke strong negative reactions toward Musk\u2019s political moves.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 08:45 PM\nSource:[nrz.de](https://www.nrz.de/politik/article409798440/elon-musk-ist-auffallend-zurueckhaltend-das-hat-einen-grund.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Puts Plan to Form New Party on Hold, Focusing on Business**\nElon Musk has put his plan to form a new political party on hold, focusing on his business ventures instead. According to sources, Musk told his allies that he wants to concentrate on his companies and doesn't want to alienate Republicans by establishing a third party that might split their votes. This decision is a reversal of his previous stance, as he announced the formation of the 'American Party' in July after President Trump signed the 'America First' bill. However, Axios reported that no formal registration documents have been submitted since Musk's promise to form the party, and a planned phone call with an external group to discuss third-party election activities was canceled. Musk is also concerned about maintaining his relationship with Vice President Harris, as he has been in touch with her and acknowledged that pursuing the party's formation might harm their relationship. Musk has expressed his willingness to support Harris in the 2028 presidential election if she decides to run, and has already spent nearly $300 million supporting Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election. While Musk's allies note that he hasn't completely ruled out forming a new party, he may still change his mind as the 2026 midterms approach. According to The Wall Street Journal, if Musk ultimately gives up on forming the 'American Party', it would be a significant victory for the Republicans before the midterms, as third parties have historically played the role of 'spoilers' and affected the vote distribution of the two major parties.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 01:25 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20250821/48741999.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Halts Plans for New Political Party, Focusing on Business**\nBillionaire Elon Musk has quietly put on hold his plans to launch a new political party, the 'America Party', citing a desire to focus on his businesses, according to the Wall Street Journal. Musk presented the party in July after a public dispute with US President Donald Trump over the tax and spending bill. Recently, he has been focused on maintaining ties with Vice President J. D. Vance, and has acknowledged to his associates that forming a political party would harm his relationship with Vance. Musk and his associates have told people close to Vance that the billionaire is considering using some of his financial resources to support Vance if he decides to run for president in 2028, according to the Journal. Musk spent nearly $300 million in 2024 to help Trump and other Republicans get elected, exercising significant influence in the early weeks of Trump's tenure as head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Reuters could not immediately verify the WSJ information. Tesla and the White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside of regular working hours. Vance, who had asked for a truce after Musk's public dispute with Trump, reaffirmed his position this month and said he had asked Musk to return to the Republican fold. Tesla's stock has fallen over 18% this year after registering its worst quarterly sales decline in over a decade and missing Wall Street's profit targets, although its profit margin was better than many had feared. Musk also warned of 'some difficult quarters' after the end of Trump's government support for electric vehicles.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 07:52 AM\nSource:[El Destape](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/internacionales/musk/musk-frena-en-seco-sus-planes-de-crear-un-nuevo-partido-politico-segun-el-wsj-202582042659)\n\n**Trump fundraising haul hits US$274 million ahead of midterms**\nThe latest Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show that Donald Trump's fundraising haul has reached US$274 million, leaving him with a significant war chest to deploy on behalf of Republican House and Senate candidates in the midterm elections. The fundraising efforts include donations from the crypto industry, with Foris DAX and Blockchain.com contributing US$10 million and US$5 million respectively. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz each gave US$3 million, while billionaire twins Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss combined to give just over US$2 million. Notably, Elon Musk, a close Trump ally, donated US$5 million to Maga Inc. on June 27, the same day he gave US$5 million cheques to two Super PACs backing Republican candidates. However, Musk has also criticized Trump and Republicans over their tax and spending bill, and in July, he vowed to create a third party.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 04, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3320689/trump-fundraising-haul-hits-us274-million-ahead-midterms-giving-republicans-huge-edge)\n\n**Elon Musk Donates $15 Million to Republican-Backed PACs, Raising Questions About His Future Role in US Politics**\nElon Musk, the world's richest man, previously clashed with US President Donald Trump over the 'big and beautiful' tax cut bill, and even threatened to form the 'American Party'. However, according to the latest campaign finance report, Musk donated $15 million to three Republican-supporting political action committees in June. Musk donated $5 million each to the 'MAGA Inc.', 'Senate Leadership Fund', and 'Congressional Leadership Fund', a total of $15 million. This donation was made on June 27, just after Musk resigned as Trump's advisor and announced his plan to form a third party. The new disclosure highlights Musk's significant influence in the US political arena and raises new questions about the role he may play in future elections. Musk has also donated $45 million to his own super PAC, 'America PAC', this year, in an attempt to influence the outcome of the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, but was unsuccessful. In the 2024 US presidential election, Musk spent over $290 million to help Trump and his supported congressional candidates win. He also served as a senior advisor to the White House and head of the government's efficiency department for several months, before leaving to focus on his own companies. At the time, he hinted that he may reduce his political spending, but by July, Musk was at odds with Trump and congressional Republicans over the 'big and beautiful' bill, and even threatened to form the American Party, but has yet to take any concrete steps towards it.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 09:55 AM\nSource:[NOWnews \u4eca\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nownews.com/news/6714547)\n\n**Elon Musk's 'American Party' Registration Delay Sparks Concerns**\nElon Musk announced the formation of a new political party, 'American Party', on July 5, but nearly a month later, he has yet to register the party. According to Axios, Musk has not submitted any formal documents to register the party. James Fishback, a Tesla investor, believes that Musk's announcement was a way to express his emotions after 'breaking up' with Trump, but he has not made any substantial progress, as he has not submitted registration documents or announced any candidates. The Independent reported that Musk has not registered the 'American Party', which is unusual for someone known for his swift actions, as he quickly formed the 'Department of Government Efficiency' during his time in the federal government. Musk's committee, 'American Political Action Committee', which he funds to support Trump's campaign, is the only formal political group he has led. Musk resigned as the head of the 'Department of Government Efficiency' in May after publicly disagreeing with Trump over the 'Big and Beautiful' tax and spending bill, which is expected to increase the US budget deficit by $340 billion over the next decade and lead to 10 million Americans losing their health insurance. Trump signed the bill on July 4, and Musk announced the formation of the 'American Party' the next day, aiming to participate in the 2024 congressional mid-term elections.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 02:39 PM\nSource:[app.myzaker.com](http://app.myzaker.com/news/article.php?pk=688b7c4c8e9f0964f82ca17d)\n\n**Musk's 'Party of America' Stalls Before Launch**\nElon Musk's political party, 'Party of America', has stalled before its launch, according to Axios. Despite the hype surrounding Musk's plans to create a new political party, no concrete steps have been taken, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Musk's potential entry into politics was seen as a disruptor in the US elections, but 'Musk read the room', Ives said. The billionaire has not taken any official steps to register the party, and communication with political consulting firms has ceased. James Fiskback, an investor in Tesla, said Musk was just 'venting his frustration' after criticizing a bill signed by President Donald Trump. Fiskback's company, Fiskback Investment, had temporarily halted trading of a Tesla-related investment fund due to Musk's re-entry into politics, but resumed it later. 'It's been 17 days since he said he would create the party... there's no file, no candidate, no nothing significant', Fiskback said. The tension between Trump and his former ally has eased, with Trump posting on social media 'I want Elon, and all companies in our country, to thrive, to thrive like never before'. However, the Democratic National Committee, which Musk used to spend around $250 million on in the 2024 election, remains active. The committee's purchasing power, a key electoral tool, remains intact despite not filing any reports this year, putting it at risk of non-compliance with Federal Election Commission rules. Ives believes Musk will continue to spend his money on supporting his preferred candidates, but it won't be a major draw for Musk or his efforts, unlike running a third party.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 12:27 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/musk-america-party-trump)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across ten expert perspectives\u2014spanning election law, campaign and party registration, political science, political consulting, and sociology\u2014there is near unanimity that the probability of an FEC Form 1 being filed for an Elon Musk-founded political party before January 1, 2026, is extremely low (estimates range from 2% to 6%, with most at 2-3%). The consensus is driven by a convergence of recent news indicating that, after briefly threatening to form a new party (the 'America Party') in July 2025, Musk has since reconciled with Donald Trump and the Republican establishment. This elite-level rapprochement eliminates the principal incentive for Musk to proceed with a move that would split GOP support or harm his business and political leverage. \n\nAll experts emphasize that: (1) No authentic Form 1 has been filed or meaningfully prepared, despite months having passed since Musk\u2019s announcement; (2) historical base rates for billionaire-led, last-minute new party formation and FEC registration are exceedingly low\u2014especially post-reconciliation; (3) legal, political, and reputational barriers make a last-minute filing highly unlikely absent a dramatic new rupture; and (4) recent media and insider reporting uniformly describe the party project as shelved, with Musk resuming his actions and influence inside the GOP. While several experts note that the short window before the cutoff technically leaves room for an impulsive reversal by Musk, all agree this window is small and unsupported by any current evidence or reporting. The only plausible 'Yes' scenarios would require an unforeseen, high-conflict split occurring in the final weeks of 2025. Thus, the dominant scenario is that no filing occurs, with probabilities aggregated near the floor of plausible outcomes.",
