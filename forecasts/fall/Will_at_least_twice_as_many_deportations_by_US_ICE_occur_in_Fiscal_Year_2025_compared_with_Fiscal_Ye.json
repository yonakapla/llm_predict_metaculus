Despite massive resource injections and removal 'surges,' numerous articles cite operational, logistical, and legal headwinds (including federal court injunctions blocking some mass enforcement methods, and structural bottlenecks in the immigration court system). Even the most favorable projections ('on pace to exceed 300,000 removals' or 'could surpass Obama-era records') point to figures in the 300k\u2013350k range by September 30. There is no plausible sign in reporting of a sudden doubling in daily removals for the rest of the fiscal year, nor of massive data underreporting or upcoming surprise releases. Therefore, the probability that ICE will deport at least twice as many people in FY25 as in FY24 is extremely low. My initial 88% NO (12% YES) forecast is justified and, if anything, a further decrease would be defensible, but I will maintain 88 to reflect some residual risk of dramatic late activity or reporting anomalies.",

Historically, ICE has some latitude to expand what is counted as a 'removal/expulsion,' especially with increased interagency removals and voluntary/CBP-facilitated returns, and future retroactive adjustments can't be ruled out during periods of high executive pressure. Additionally, the sheer volume and speed of recent administrative orders and novel statutory authorities in 2025 could, in rare scenarios, temporarily bypass typical bottlenecks.

The additional arguments\u2014especially from Migration Systems and Latin American Studies experts\u2014reinforce the notion that, beyond hard logistical limits, there are systemwide feedbacks and societal constraints that throttle removal rates despite maximal political and fiscal incentives.

No credible mechanistic, procedural, or legal pathway exists for such a late-cycle change of outcome magnitude.

He added that another million people have self\u2011deported and that up to 6\u202fmillion people who are staying illegally will be removed either by forced deportation or self\u2011deportation. Hough said that Trump\u2019s deployment of the military to the southern border has cut illegal crossings by over 90\u202fpercent. He also noted that during the Biden administration more than 10\u202fmillion people entered the country illegally. Hough cautioned students on visas to avoid political protests and urged them to follow proper channels for extensions.

It cites that 332,000 people have been deported so far, and that 92\u202f% of construction firms report hiring difficulties. The piece notes that immigrants comprise nearly 20\u202f% of the workforce, 45\u202f% of farm, fishing and forestry workers, 30\u202f% of construction workers, 24\u202f% of service workers, and a third of home\u2011health aides. It claims that the Biden administration\u2019s immigration surge added $1.2\u202ftrillion to federal coffers and $8.9\u202ftrillion to nominal GDP, but also increased costs for education, health care and housing. The article quotes David Bier of the Cato Institute, who says the U.S. is 35\u202fmillion workers short by the 2030s. It calls for legislation such as Rep. Derrick Van\u202fOrden\u2019s bill to legalize undocumented agricultural workers. The author concludes that the current policy is a \"cruel campaign\" that threatens the economy and moral fabric of the country, and urges a more nuanced, dispassionate message: 'It is time to craft a more nuanced, dispassionate message that recognizes both immigrants' contributions to this country and the need for secure borders.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Las Vegas Sun](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2025/sep/16/mass-deportations-are-creating-a-workforce-crisis/)\n\n**Deportations Break Families with Years of Roots in the US, Report Reveals**\nA report by the Kino Initiative for the Border found that among 278 migrants deported from Mexico to Nogales, Sonora between May and July 2024, 44% had lived in the United States for more than ten years, creating social ruptures that undermine family life and community stability. The study, titled 'Ellos no me dejaron decir adi\u00f3s', also reports that 39.2% of the deportees were separated from a family member\u2014most often a partner or child, many of whom were U.S. citizens. The report states that 57% of the deportees were residing in the United States at the time of their detention, compared with 5% the previous year. It notes that 33% of the deportations began with a local or state law\u2011enforcement detention, and almost half involved ICE directly, usually in public spaces such as streets and courthouses. Sixty percent of the arrests occurred in Arizona, with the remainder from California, Florida, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington. The deportees described overcrowding, medical neglect, exposure to toxic smoke, verbal and physical abuse, and prolonged transfers in degrading conditions, which the report says violate the right to personal integrity and access to basic health services. The report quotes: 'Muchas de estas personas tienen un profundo arraigo en sus comunidades, incluyendo hijos, c\u00f3nyuges y otras personas en Estados Unidos', highlighting the emotional, financial and caregiving difficulties faced by families left behind.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 11:56 PM\nSource:[La Jornada de San Luis](https://lajornadasanluis.com.mx/deportaciones-rompen-familias-con-anos-de-arraigo-en-eu-revela-informe/)\n\n**United States: Cuban Fear of End of Migratory Privilege Under Donald Trump**\nThe article reports on the changing migratory privileges for Cuban nationals in the United States under the Donald\u202fTrump administration. It follows 54\u2011year\u2011old artist Vizca\u00edno, who fled Cuba in 2022 and now lives in Arizona and Miami. Vizca\u00edno explains that he entered the U.S. with an i\u2011220A document, which \"allows entry\" but is not recognized by authorities as legal entry, leaving him in a legal limbo and fearful of arrest. He says, 'Hago menos de todo porque vivo en p\u00e1nico' and asks, 'No entiendo que me digan ilegal. Si soy ilegal, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 me dieron ayuda econ\u00f3mica y un n\u00famero de seguridad social cuando entr\u00e9?'. The article cites data from the Miami\u202fHerald that in 2025 ICE detains about 500 irregular Cubans per month, up from nearly 150 in 2024, and that 863 Cubans were deported in 2025. It also notes that the Obama administration ended the \"dry\u2011feet, wet\u2011feet\" policy in 2017, and that the Trump administration\u2019s high deportation targets have intensified enforcement. Professor Michael\u202fJ.\u202fBustamante and attorney Wilfredo\u202fAllen comment that the special pathways enjoyed by Cubans since the Cold War are eroding, and that ICE has never before detained Cubans with i\u2011220A at immigration courts.

Of the 393 individuals, 32 were apprehended for criminal offenses and 21 for alleged immigration violations.  The data show that 219 of the 393 people had a \u2018departed date\u2019 and \u2018departure country\u2019 listed, indicating they have been deported; the leading destination was Mexico (119 people), followed by Guatemala (24) and Honduras (22), with 15 other countries represented.  The records lack personal identifiers such as names, birth dates, and street addresses for many arrests, which the article notes hampers accountability.  ICE has repeatedly cited the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to justify redactions, yet the agency has issued press releases naming detainees in other contexts.  Block\u202fClub sued ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for FOIA violations after a prolonged lack of response; the lawsuit was filed in May\u202f2024.  The article quotes ICE\u2019s media contact\u2019s automated response: 'Thank you for your email,' and cites immigration expert Trina Realmuto\u2019s observation that \u2018there is no other way to get them to respond to FOIA requests, and the backlog is getting worse.\u2019  The piece highlights that ICE\u2019s 2024 fiscal year saw 59,300 FOIA requests, with 22,246 pending at year\u2011end, and that the National Immigration Litigation Alliance is working to secure regular data releases.  Overall, the article presents a detailed, evidence\u2011based account of ICE\u2019s post\u2011inauguration arrests and the challenges of obtaining full transparency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 01:31 PM\nSource:[Block Club Chicago](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/16/ice-arrested-nearly-400-in-chicago-nearby-states-in-the-days-after-trumps-inauguration-records/)\n\n**Pro-Trump Chicago Restaurateur Heads To Washington To Urge President To Slow Deportations**\nChicago restaurateur Sam Sanchez, a supporter of President Donald Trump, flew to Washington, D.C., to urge the White House to slow mass deportations and revive bipartisan immigration reform. Sanchez, former chair of the Illinois Restaurant Association and owner of venues such as Moe's Cantina, said he voted for Trump because of a 'law\u2011and\u2011order' stance that targets violent offenders, but he is alarmed by the current wave of deportations of non\u2011violent, hard\u2011working immigrants in Chicago. He told reporters, 'I can't regret supporting law and order,' and added, 'But what they're doing now... is not what the president promised.' Sanchez plans to meet senior White House advisers on Wednesday to push for 'common\u2011sense' reform and to honor Trump\u2019s 2024 Meet the Press pledge to help Dreamers\u2014children brought to the U.S. who are protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2014gain a path to citizenship. He also wants the administration to slow deportations of essential workers. Central to his campaign is the bipartisan Dignity Act, sponsored by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar and Veronica Escobar, which would grant renewable work permits and eventual permanent status to undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. since before 2020 and have no serious criminal record. The article notes that ICE launched Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, leading to increased raids and the fatal shooting of 38\u2011year\u2011old Silverio Villegas\u2011Gonzalez by an ICE agent; the incident sparked outrage among Latino leaders. Sanchez defended Trump, arguing that aggressive immigration officials\u2014not the president\u2014drive the surge, and warned that the administration risks alienating Hispanic voters. He cited exit polls showing about 46\u202f% of Latinos voted for Trump in 10 battleground states and nearly 48\u202f% nationwide, and noted that Trump\u2019s approval among Latinos fell from 43\u202f% to 39\u202f% in a recent poll. Sanchez has donated $118,831 to Illinois and Chicago politicians since 2003 and $1,000 each to U.S. Rep. Adriano de Jes\u00fas Espaillat Rodr\u00edguez and the Defend the Dream PAC. He concluded, 'I'm not lying to you -- I have my passport in my pocket right now,' highlighting his vigilance amid ICE activity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 12:54 PM\nSource:[Block Club Chicago](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/16/pro-trump-chicago-restaurateur-heads-to-washington-to-urge-president-to-slow-deportations/)\n\n**Deportations Break Families with Years of Roots in the U.S., Report Reveals**\nA report released by the Jesuit Migrants Network (Red Jesuita con Migrantes) found that deportations in the United States are tearing apart families that have been rooted in the country for years. The study, titled \"Ellos no me dejaron decir adi\u00f3s,\" interviewed 278 deportees held at a temporary Mexican detention center in Nogales. It reported that 39.2\u202f% of those deported were separated from a family member\u2014most often a partner or child, many of whom were U.S. citizens. The report also noted that 57\u202f% of the deportees had been living in the United States at the time of their arrest, up from 5\u202f% the previous year, indicating a shift toward deporting long\u2011established communities. 33\u202f% of the deportations began with a local or state law\u2011enforcement detainment, and almost half involved the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in public spaces such as streets and courthouses. 60\u202f% of the arrests occurred in Arizona, with the remainder spread across California, Florida, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.  The report highlights the harsh conditions experienced during detention and transport\u2014overcrowding, medical neglect, exposure to toxic smoke, verbal and physical abuse, and prolonged transfers in degrading conditions.  \"Estos relatos evidencian una vulneraci\u00f3n al derecho a la integridad personal y al acceso a servicios b\u00e1sicos de salud,\" the report states.

It cites that 332,000 people have been deported so far, and that 92\u202f% of construction firms report hiring difficulties. The piece notes that immigrants comprise nearly 20\u202f% of the workforce, 45\u202f% of farm, fishing and forestry workers, 30\u202f% of construction workers, 24\u202f% of service workers, and a third of home\u2011health aides. It claims that the Biden administration\u2019s immigration surge added $1.2\u202ftrillion to federal coffers and $8.9\u202ftrillion to nominal GDP, but also increased costs for education, health care and housing. The article quotes David Bier of the Cato Institute, who says the U.S. is 35\u202fmillion workers short by the 2030s. It calls for legislation such as Rep. Derrick Van\u202fOrden\u2019s bill to legalize undocumented agricultural workers. The author concludes that the current policy is a \"cruel campaign\" that threatens the economy and moral fabric of the country, and urges a more nuanced, dispassionate message: 'It is time to craft a more nuanced, dispassionate message that recognizes both immigrants' contributions to this country and the need for secure borders.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Las Vegas Sun](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2025/sep/16/mass-deportations-are-creating-a-workforce-crisis/)\n\n**Deportations Break Families with Years of Roots in the US, Report Reveals**\nA report by the Kino Initiative for the Border found that among 278 migrants deported from Mexico to Nogales, Sonora between May and July 2024, 44% had lived in the United States for more than ten years, creating social ruptures that undermine family life and community stability.

It follows 54\u2011year\u2011old artist Vizca\u00edno, who fled Cuba in 2022 and now lives in Arizona and Miami. Vizca\u00edno explains that he entered the U.S. with an i\u2011220A document, which \"allows entry\" but is not recognized by authorities as legal entry, leaving him in a legal limbo and fearful of arrest. He says, 'Hago menos de todo porque vivo en p\u00e1nico' and asks, 'No entiendo que me digan ilegal. Si soy ilegal, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 me dieron ayuda econ\u00f3mica y un n\u00famero de seguridad social cuando entr\u00e9?'. The article cites data from the Miami\u202fHerald that in 2025 ICE detains about 500 irregular Cubans per month, up from nearly 150 in 2024, and that 863 Cubans were deported in 2025. It also notes that the Obama administration ended the \"dry\u2011feet, wet\u2011feet\" policy in 2017, and that the Trump administration\u2019s high deportation targets have intensified enforcement. Professor Michael\u202fJ.\u202fBustamante and attorney Wilfredo\u202fAllen comment that the special pathways enjoyed by Cubans since the Cold War are eroding, and that ICE has never before detained Cubans with i\u2011220A at immigration courts.

According to Guatemalan financial analyst Jahir Dabroy, migrants \u2018when they perceive a high probability of deportation, as is happening now, they try to send any non\u2011banked cash to their families as quickly as possible\u2019.  The impact of deportations is reflected not only at borders but also in the flow of money back home.  In Central America, family remittances grew 20\u202f% in the first half of 2025.  In Colombia, remittances reached $1.158\u202fmillion in July 2025, a 15.1\u202f% increase over the previous year, according to the Central Bank.  In Honduras and Nicaragua, remittance inflows represent up to a quarter of each country\u2019s national economy.  The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) reported that remittance flows totaled US$6,874.5\u202fmillion between January and July 2025.  July alone saw remittances of US$1,047.7\u202fmillion, up US$125.8\u202fmillion (13.6\u202f%) from July 2024 and US$123.9\u202fmillion (13.4\u202f%) from June 2025.

The figure includes the last three and a half months of the Biden administration, but the bulk of the removals occurred under President Trump, who has roughly doubled the deportation pace compared to his predecessor. The agency\u2019s latest count on Sept. 6 shows 58,766 migrants in detention, down from an all\u2011time high of over 61,000 on Aug. 23. ICE is arresting about 920 people a day, a rate that has been steady since late July; it peaked at nearly 1,200 a day in early June during a high\u2011profile immigration arrest push in Los Angeles. Of those detained, 35% have criminal convictions and 30% have pending charges, a decline from over 40% in May, indicating a shift toward targeting migrants without criminal records. In the latter part of the Biden era, more than 90% of ICE arrests in detention had criminal records. The average daily deportation rate last year was about 740, while under Trump it averages 1,350, which, if sustained, would project roughly 335,000 deportations by the fiscal year\u2019s end. The all\u2011time record of 410,000 deportations was set in 2012 under President Obama. These data illustrate a significant increase in ICE\u2019s removal activity, especially during the Trump administration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/sep/12/ice-tops-300000-deportations-first-time-decade/)\n\n**The Lie of Mass Deportations**\nThe article argues that President Trump\u2019s promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants was a political bluff.  According to a FOIA request, between Inauguration Day and July\u202f31, 2023, ICE recorded about 145,000 removals, including self\u2011deportations, averaging 750 per day.  Extrapolated, this would amount to roughly one million removals over four years \u2013 a figure the author claims was never achieved.

The author quotes Trump saying, \u2018We need the people,\u2019 to illustrate the economic rationale for keeping low\u2011wage immigrant labor.  The article contends that the promised trade\u2011off between immigration enforcement and foreign policy gains was a sham, and that political power, not voter turnout, drives policy.

Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies noted that 38\u202f% of voluntary departure cases under Trump came from the border, compared with 20\u202f% under Biden. David\u202fBier of the Cato Institute said total removals have not increased much year\u2011to\u2011year, suggesting a hard capacity limit, and that removals of recent border crossers have fallen while removals of those in the U.S. for more than six months have tripled. The article claims that over a million aliens have left voluntarily, and that ICE\u2019s capacity to increase enforcement is limited by budget and staffing, despite Trump\u2019s \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\" The piece urges that the left should not criticize the administration for not deporting enough people.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 08:51 PM\nSource:[www.independentsentinel.com](https://www.independentsentinel.com/mass-deportations-have-not-begun-yet/)\n\n**ICE Surpasses 200,000 Deportations in First Year of Trump\u2019s Return, Marking Highest Spike in Ten Years**\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has carried out almost 200,000 deportations since January 2025, when Donald Trump returned to the presidency, according to a senior DHS official.  This places the administration on track to record the highest number of expulsions in a decade, a sharp reversal of the Biden era.  ICE\u2019s total deportations for the first seven months of Trump\u2019s second term are close to 350,000, combining ICE, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Coast Guard actions and voluntary departures.  CBP alone has logged more than 132,000 expulsions, with an additional 17,500 voluntary returns, bringing the combined total to nearly 350,000.  If the current pace continues, the fiscal year 2025 could end with over 300,000 deportations, the highest level since the Obama administration\u2019s 2014 peak of about 316,000.\n\nICE officials say the intensified operations are restoring border control and removing those who are not entitled to stay in the country.  A spokesperson for ICE stated, 'Estamos recuperando el control de nuestras fronteras y devolviendo a quienes no tienen derecho a estar en este pa\u00eds.'  The surge has been felt in major immigrant\u2011dense cities such as Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Houston, where community groups report widespread fear and families avoiding public institutions.\n\nMaria Hern\u00e1ndez, an activist with the Coalition for Immigrant Rights in Florida, warned that the policy is separating families and hurting the local economy: 'Estamos viendo padres detenidos cuando llevan a sus hijos al colegio, o trabajadores arrestados en sus centros de empleo. Esto no solo separa familias, tambi\u00e9n golpea la econom\u00eda local.'  Democratic senators, including Alex Padilla, have criticized the measures as a return to the darkest days of U.S. immigration, while Republican Senator Ted Cruz praised the administration for enforcing immigration laws without hesitation.\n\nEconomists caution that the crackdown could impact key sectors that rely on immigrant labor, such as agriculture, construction and hospitality, and that the resulting economic contraction may further strain local communities.

A DHS spokesperson said, 'Ante un n\u00famero hist\u00f3rico de \u00f3rdenes judiciales emitidas por jueces activistas, el ICE, la CBP y la Guardia Costera de EE.UU. han logrado un progreso hist\u00f3rico para cumplir la promesa del presidente Trump de arrestar y deportar a los inmigrantes indocumentados que han invadido nuestro pa\u00eds', adding that undocumented immigrants are being warned to 'v\u00e9anse ahora o afronten las consecuencias'.  However, inside the administration, officials remain frustrated with ICE\u2019s performance, noting that while arrest numbers have roughly doubled compared to the Biden era, interior arrests have fluctuated between 1,000 and 2,000 daily\u2014well below the White House goal of 3,000 daily.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 03:59 PM\nSource:[LaPatilla.com](https://lapatilla.com/2025/08/28/ice-deporto-a-casi-200-mil-personas-desde-que-trump-regreso-al-cargo/)\n\n**ICE Deported Nearly 200,000 People Since Trump Returned to Office, Heading Toward Highest Rate in a Decade**\nICE deported almost 200,000 people in the first seven months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, according to a senior DHS official, putting the agency on track for its highest deportation rate in at least a decade but still below the administration\u2019s target.  The Trump administration has recorded nearly 350,000 deportations since January, including 132,000 by CBP and 17,500 self\u2011deportations, matching the total ICE deportations for the same period.  ICE had previously deported about 71,400 people between October 2024 and December 2024, and is projected to exceed 300,000 deportations in fiscal year 2025, ending September 30.  The last time ICE reached such a figure was during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, when roughly 316,000 people were expelled in fiscal year 2014.  Trump\u2019s administration has mobilized multiple federal agencies to strengthen immigration enforcement, especially in cities like Los Angeles and Washington.  The DHS official stated, 'Ante un n\u00famero hist\u00f3rico de \u00f3rdenes judiciales emitidas por jueces activistas, el ICE, la CBP y la Guardia Costera de EE. UU. han logrado un progreso hist\u00f3rico para cumplir la promesa del presidente Trump de arrestar y deportar a los inmigrantes indocumentados que han invadido nuestro pa\u00eds', and added that 'los inmigrantes indocumentados est\u00e1n escuchando nuestro mensaje: v\u00e9anse ahora o afronten las consecuencias'.  Despite these claims, internal data show that interior arrests have fluctuated between 1,000 and 2,000 daily, below the White House goal of 3,000.  Trump\u2019s campaign promised a million deportations per year, but resource constraints have made mass expulsions difficult.  ICE is set to receive almost US$75\u202fbillion through 2029, with US$45\u202fbillion earmarked for detention center capacity and the remaining US$30\u202fbillion for enforcement and deportation operations.  The DHS has also promoted voluntary departure through multi\u2011million\u2011dollar advertising campaigns and financial incentives, with Secretary Kristi Noem praising the administration\u2019s \u2018contundente mensaje\u2019 at a recent White House Cabinet meeting.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 08:27 AM\nSource:[ABC17NEWS](https://abc17news.com/news/2025/08/28/ice-deporto-a-casi-200-000-personas-desde-que-trump-regreso-al-cargo-camino-a-alcanzar-el-nivel-mas-alto-en-una-decada/)\n\n**US Deports Over 1,300 People Daily, Highest Rate Since Years**\nThe US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is deporting approximately 1,300 people daily, according to the latest data released by the agency. This represents a significant increase in the Trump administration's efforts to step up deportation efforts. According to numbers released on July 26, ICE has deported 246,287 people since the beginning of the fiscal year, an increase from 228,282 cases recorded on July 12, which translates to 1,286 daily deportations, as reported by the Washington Times. If this rate continues, the total number of deportations could exceed 470,000 by the end of the year, surpassing the record set in 2012 under President Barack Obama, which was around 420,000 deportations. Despite the increase in deportations, the number of daily arrests has decreased to less than 900, indicating challenges in implementing Trump's goal of deporting millions who entered the country during the 'border chaos' under former President Joe Biden. The agency is facing legal challenges in this context, with a judge in Los Angeles ruling last month that some of the security campaigns conducted by ICE in June were unconstitutional, and a judge in Washington blocking the use of expedited deportation procedures against migrants who entered the country with a 'conditional release' permit issued by the Biden administration. Currently, ICE is holding 56,945 people, a slightly lower number than the peak of 57,861 in June, but significantly higher than last year's numbers, which ranged from 30,000 to 40,000 detainees. The budget approved by Trump includes funding to significantly expand the agency's detention and deportation capabilities, which could lead to increased numbers in the coming months as the agency escalates its activities. 'We are seeing a significant increase in deportations, and it's a clear indication of the Trump administration's efforts to step up deportation efforts,' said an ICE spokesperson, as reported by the Washington Times. 'We are committed to enforcing our immigration laws and protecting national security.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 05:18 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/8/1/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A8-1300-%D8%B4%D8%AE%D8%B5-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89/7074656)\n\n**Trump Team Pushing 'Utter Propaganda' on Deportations to Create 'Climate of Fear': Experts**\nTrump\u2019s administration announced a mass deportation operation that began the day after his inauguration. The White House posted on social media that \u2018Deportation Flights Have Begun.\u2019 According to the article, ICE arrested 538 undocumented immigrants on Thursday, while a former Capitol Hill staffer noted that Biden\u2019s average arrests were often higher. Experts countered the narrative, noting that the 2024 average of 4.27 deportation flights per day (including weekends) and 508 flights to Guatemala that year represent \u2018just under an average of 10 flights per week.\u2019 They also highlighted that the 2024 cargo\u2011plane flight carried 75\u201180 people, \u2018lower than the average of 125\u2019 on ICE deportation flights to Guatemala. The article quotes an expert saying, \u2018The only thing new about this is subjecting people to transport on a cargo plane rather than charter and the LOWER number of people on the plane \u2013 75\u201180 compared to the average for ICE deportation flights to Guatemala of 125.\u2019 The piece also reports that the Trump administration\u2019s social\u2011media push is intended to create a \u2018climate of fear\u2019 and that experts view it as propaganda.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 06:38 PM\nSource:[thenewcivilrightsmovement.com](https://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2025/01/trump-team-pushing-utter-propaganda-on-deportations-to-create-climate-of-fear-experts/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts unanimously assess that it is extremely unlikely U.S. ICE will deport at least twice as many people in Fiscal Year 2025 as in Fiscal Year 2024 (542,968+ vs. 271,484), based on a convergence of institutional, legal, operational, and historical factors. Despite an increase in deportations during 2025\u2014driven by heightened political focus, additional funding, and aggressive rhetoric under the Trump administration\u2014actual mid-September ICE removal figures put FY2025 on track for approximately 320,000 to 350,000 deportations, far short of the threshold necessary for a 'Yes' resolution.\n\nExperts across discipline\u2014immigration law, public administration, political science, sociology, and area studies\u2014cite consistent historical ceilings (the highest-ever ICE deportations were about 410,000 under Obama in 2012); ongoing judicial challenges and injunctions blocking expedited removal; physical and bureaucratic bottlenecks in detention, case processing, and transport; and significant diplomatic, economic, and societal resistance curbing operational capacity. While additional factors like voluntary departures and creative counting could marginally increase totals, the fine print and ICE reporting standards exclude enough of these to prevent bridging the gap. Even the most optimistic projections, assuming very aggressive month-to-month escalation, only approach 400,000\u2014making a sudden, unprecedented late-year surge to more than 540,000 implausible. Expert probabilities for a 'Yes' outcome cluster between 2% and 12%, with nearly all citing base rates, year-to-date data, and the absence of system-transforming breakthroughs. In summary, all available data and expert analysis indicate the question will resolve 'No'\u2014ICE deportations in FY2025 will not double those of FY2024.",
