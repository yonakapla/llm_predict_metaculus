Recent Q2 Eurozone growth is anemic (0.1% q/q, 1.5% y/y), and Germany/Italy remain weak, reducing the probability of a full catchup within just one quarter (Q3 2025). Risks to the Yes outcome center on abrupt Spanish deceleration, but such a reversal appears unlikely in just one quarter given present data and ongoing external support.

Nearly all forecasters, whether focused on macroeconomic modeling, scenario analysis, or theoretical frameworks (endogenous and New Keynesian growth, optimum currency area, integration/convergence, etc.), anchor their reasoning in the base rate (recent substantial Spanish outperformance), strong near-term realized data (Q2 2025: Spain 2.8% y/y vs 1.5% for the Eurozone), and institutional forecasts for 2025 (Spain ~2.7%, EZ ~1.2%). Structural headwinds and mean reversion risks are consistently acknowledged, yet argued to operate primarily over a longer horizon than the 1-year window to Q3 2025. Critiques of slightly overstated structural risks in some responses reinforce, rather than undercut, the near-term case for Spanish outperformance. No new arguments surfaced that would substantially increase or lower the risk of a sharp reversal by Q3 2025.

No participant advanced a compelling argument or new evidence to support either a higher or lower probability for the Yes outcome.

Debates over possible convergence and impending headwinds stress that the narrowing gap is real, but nearly all arguments point to the substantial statistical lead that Spain still holds as of Q2 2025, as well as the inertia of macroeconomic momentum over a single-year interval.

Several critiques reinforce that most structural headwinds will play out over a longer horizon.

President Isabel D\u00edaz\u202fAyuso highlighted Madrid as 'el motor econ\u00f3mico de Espa\u00f1a' and said that 'cada vez que se habla de las cifras de Espa\u00f1a, un tercio de esas cifras las aporta Madrid'. She added that cumulative growth since 2019 is 10%, 2.7 percentage points above the national average and almost triple the Eurozone average. D\u00edaz\u202fAyuso described Madrid as a 'puerto seguro en mitad de una tormenta global' and said the region is 'en equilibrio, de manera humana' and 'en uno de sus momentos m\u00e1s positivos'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:20 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/madrid/noticia-economia-madrilena-crecio-29-segundo-trimestre-supera-25800-millones-inversion-extranjera-20250922102021.html)\n\n**Five Pending Issues in the Spanish Economy That Growth Cannot Hide**\nThe Spanish government, the Bank of Spain and the Funcas panel project that Spain\u2019s GDP will grow steadily until 2027, with 3.2% in 2024, 2.7% in 2025 and around 2% in 2026\u201127\u2014higher than most EU peers.  Economy Minister Carlos\u202fCuerpo said the challenge is to \"translate that economic growth into social improvements\" and to keep \"progressing\" amid a structural change.  Economist Eduardo\u202fGarz\u00f3n warned that projections can fail and that the GDP figure does not capture quality of life, adding that he is more concerned with unemployment, wages and inflation.  Spain\u2019s labour market remains a key issue: the overall unemployment rate is 10.4\u202f% (Eurostat) and 10.29\u202f% (INE), the highest in the EU, while youth unemployment sits at 24.5\u202f% (INE) and 24\u202f% (Eurostat).  The housing market is another hurdle; house prices rose 12.7\u202f% and rents 14\u202f% in 2024, with a 24\u202f% cost to buy and 38\u202f% to rent according to Fotocasa.  Real wages have barely grown\u2014only 2.76\u202f% over the last 30\u202fyears\u2014leaving a 45\u202f% wage gap between young and older workers and a 20\u202f% gender pay gap (men 30,372.49\u202f\u20ac vs women 25,591.31\u202f\u20ac).  Productivity remains low, and Spain is among the five EU countries with the highest severe material deprivation (8.3\u202f% of the population, versus the EU average of 6.4\u202f%).  Material poverty is 19.7\u202f% of the population, with only a slight decline since the pandemic.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 04:06 AM\nSource:[P\u00fablico.es](https://www.publico.es/economia/cinco-asignaturas-pendientes-economia-espanola-crecimiento-puede-ocultar.html)\n\n**Now or Never: Europe Needs Ambition to Reclaim Economic Growth**\nParticipants of the Economic Observatory say there is \"much that can still be done and there is no time to lose,\" and they argue that Europe must feel an \"urgency for growth.\" The European Central Bank is urging governments to adopt economic and fiscal policies that favour growth and job creation, framing the issue as one of Europe\u2019s future political and social direction. In Spain, macro\u2011economic indicators appear better than in the eurozone, with GDP growing 2.8\u202f% in the first half of 2025\u2014well above the eurozone average\u2014and 3.2\u202f% in 2024, both exceeding expectations. However, experts point to a lack of structural reforms. \u00c1ngel de la Fuente, CEO of Fedea, notes that Spain\u2019s growth is \"more extensive than intensive,\" driven largely by population and labour\u2011market expansion rather than a significant rise in GDP per capita. He questions whether Spain is experiencing \"tailwinds\" or a shift to a new growth model driven by emerging structural factors.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 03:28 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2025-09-22/observatorio-economico-el-confidencial-mapfre_4211788/)\n\n**Spain Leads EU GDP but Living Standards Lag Behind**\nEurostat\u2019s latest \"consumo individual efectivo\" indicator shows that Spain\u2019s aggregate value added from goods, services, public aid and welfare services remains eight points below the EU average, despite a 3.5\u202f% GDP growth in 2024 that matches Denmark and is only behind Croatia. The indicator also reveals that Spain\u2019s living standard is 26 points below Germany\u2019s, 14 points below France\u2019s and 6 points below Italy\u2019s, placing Spain 15th in the EU ranking of 27 countries. The article attributes the persistent gap to a higher inflation rate over the past three years and a significant rise in fiscal pressure: the tax burden on households is projected to reach 39\u202f% of GDP this year, up from 34\u202f% before the S\u00e1nchez administration, with the bulk of the increase falling on workers. The combined social security and IRPF contributions now account for 40.2\u202f% of a single, child\u2011free worker\u2019s gross salary. A recent Funcas study is quoted as saying that \u2018el IRPF ha frenado el crecimiento de la renta real neta media de los hogares espa\u00f1oles\u2019, underscoring that Spanish households have not regained the pre\u20112008 real purchasing power. The article notes that the large public spending surge since 2018 has largely gone into expanding bureaucratic structures and subsidies with low aggregate impact, rather than improving public service quality, which has deteriorated since the pandemic.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:14 PM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/economia/2025/09/22/68d03c4fe5fdea8b148b45ac.html)\n\n**Carmen Tom\u00e1s \u2013 Triumphality Fails to Reach Households**\nThe Spanish government updated its economic forecasts this week, announcing a 2.7\u202f% GDP growth for 2025, a figure the Minister of Economy, Carlos Cuerpo, hailed as a management success and evidence of economic strength.  However, the article argues that this growth largely stems from increased public spending and does not translate into real welfare gains for households.  Key indicators show a decline in foreign investment, rising consumer\u2011basket prices, a surge in housing costs, and a reduction in disposable income after high tax burdens and social security contributions.  Youth unemployment remains one of the highest in Europe, general unemployment stays above chronic thresholds, and more than 2.3\u202fmillion people depend on the Minimum Income Benefit to make ends meet.  The poverty index is expanding, pushing more Spaniards toward exclusion.  The Bank of Spain projects that 2026 GDP growth will be half of 2023\u2019s level, hampered by rising labor costs, while both the Bank of Spain and AIReF note Spain\u2019s failure to meet EU public\u2011spending commitments despite a 12\u202f% rise in the IRPF last year.  The government\u2019s rhetoric that Spain is \"the best economy on the planet\" relies on percentages that mask the daily reality of millions, where wage increases are swallowed by inflation, a lack of IRPF deflation, and higher taxes.  In short, macro\u2011economic statistics paint a picture of dynamism, yet many Spaniards live poorer than before, and the 2.7\u202f% growth is a mirage that does not hide the widening poverty gap.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/otr-press/firmas/carmentomas/noticia-carmen-tomas-triunfalismo-no-llega-hogares-20250921080048.html)\n\n**Madrid, Spain\u2019s Economic Engine Despite S\u00e1nchez\u2019s 'Attacks', Grew 2.9% in Q2**\nThe article reports that in 2024 the Madrid region attracted \u20ac25.812\u202fbillion in foreign investment, the second\u2011best record in its history.

She said Madrid is \"the economic engine of Spain\" and that \"each time Spain\u2019s figures are discussed, a third of those figures come from Madrid.\" Ayuso highlighted that cumulative growth since 2019 is 10\u202f%, 2.7 percentage points above the national average. She also announced the launch of Madrid\u2019s first Internationalisation Strategy in 2026 and the next step in drafting a new law against hyper\u2011regulation, which will simplify or eliminate outdated rules and be reviewed every two years.

The week is crucial for investors, firms and policymakers to adjust growth forecasts, assess inflation risks and shape investment strategies.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 10:15 AM\nSource:[Poder360](https://www.poder360.com.br/poder-economia/semana-tera-revisao-do-pib-nos-eua-e-indicadores-na-europa/)\n\n**Reasons Barclays Predicts ECB December Rate Cut**\nBarclays analysts predict that the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut rates by 25 basis points at its December meeting as part of risk\u2011management.  The analysts, led by strategist Silvia Aldana, cite growing concerns that the ECB\u2019s medium\u2011term inflation target of 2\u202f% will remain below that level for an extended period.  They argue that these concerns will be reinforced by a slowdown in real GDP growth in the second half of 2025, a weaker currency, a deceleration in nominal wage growth, and updated forecasts that show inflation falling below 2\u202f% in at least part of 2026 and 2027.  The analysts also note that the euro\u2011area economy is not in a good state but is expected to improve, with real GDP projected to stagnate in Q3 2025 and grow only 0.1\u202f% in the final quarter of 2025.  They foresee acceleration next year as the negative impact of tariff hikes and trade\u2011related uncertainty eases and monetary and fiscal policy support strengthens.  Growth is expected to rebound in Germany, France and Italy, while Spain is projected to slow due to a pull\u2011back from multi\u2011year trends, stabilisation of immigration inflows and lower absorption of EU post\u2011pandemic recovery funds.  The ECB left policy rates unchanged this month because inflation is broadly on target but economic and political outlooks remain uncertain.  The ECB cut its main deposit rate to 2\u202f% in June, halving the previous peak of 4\u202f% over a year, but has paused the rate\u2011cut cycle.  Core inflation is forecast at 2.4\u202f% in 2025, 1.9\u202f% in 2026 and 1.8\u202f% in 2027, while headline inflation is expected to average 2.1\u202f% in 2025, 1.7\u202f% in 2026 and 1.9\u202f% in 2027.  Real GDP growth is projected at 1.2\u202f% in 2025 (up from an earlier 0.9\u202f% estimate), 1.0\u202f% in 2026 (slightly lower) and 1.3\u202f% in 2027 (unchanged).\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 09:18 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/economy/article-1255724)\n\n**Barclays Expects ECB Rate Cut in December**\nBarclays analysts predict that the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points at its December meeting as a form of risk\u2011management.

They add that euro\u2011zone growth is 'not in a good place' but is projected to improve, with real GDP expected to stagnate in the third quarter of 2025 and grow only 0.1\u202f% on a quarter\u2011on\u2011quarter basis in the final three months of 2025 before accelerating next year as the negative effect of higher tariffs and trade\u2011related uncertainty fades.

Economy Minister Carlos\u202fCuerpo said the challenge is to \"translate that economic growth into social improvements\" and to keep \"progressing\" amid a structural change.  Economist Eduardo\u202fGarz\u00f3n warned that projections can fail and that the GDP figure does not capture quality of life, adding that he is more concerned with unemployment, wages and inflation.  Spain\u2019s labour market remains a key issue: the overall unemployment rate is 10.4\u202f% (Eurostat) and 10.29\u202f% (INE), the highest in the EU, while youth unemployment sits at 24.5\u202f% (INE) and 24\u202f% (Eurostat).  The housing market is another hurdle; house prices rose 12.7\u202f% and rents 14\u202f% in 2024, with a 24\u202f% cost to buy and 38\u202f% to rent according to Fotocasa.  Real wages have barely grown\u2014only 2.76\u202f% over the last 30\u202fyears\u2014leaving a 45\u202f% wage gap between young and older workers and a 20\u202f% gender pay gap (men 30,372.49\u202f\u20ac vs women 25,591.31\u202f\u20ac).  Productivity remains low, and Spain is among the five EU countries with the highest severe material deprivation (8.3\u202f% of the population, versus the EU average of 6.4\u202f%).  Material poverty is 19.7\u202f% of the population, with only a slight decline since the pandemic.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 04:06 AM\nSource:[P\u00fablico.es](https://www.publico.es/economia/cinco-asignaturas-pendientes-economia-espanola-crecimiento-puede-ocultar.html)\n\n**Now or Never: Europe Needs Ambition to Reclaim Economic Growth**\nParticipants of the Economic Observatory say there is \"much that can still be done and there is no time to lose,\" and they argue that Europe must feel an \"urgency for growth.\" The European Central Bank is urging governments to adopt economic and fiscal policies that favour growth and job creation, framing the issue as one of Europe\u2019s future political and social direction. In Spain, macro\u2011economic indicators appear better than in the eurozone, with GDP growing 2.8\u202f% in the first half of 2025\u2014well above the eurozone average\u2014and 3.2\u202f% in 2024, both exceeding expectations. However, experts point to a lack of structural reforms. \u00c1ngel de la Fuente, CEO of Fedea, notes that Spain\u2019s growth is \"more extensive than intensive,\" driven largely by population and labour\u2011market expansion rather than a significant rise in GDP per capita. He questions whether Spain is experiencing \"tailwinds\" or a shift to a new growth model driven by emerging structural factors.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 03:28 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2025-09-22/observatorio-economico-el-confidencial-mapfre_4211788/)\n\n**Spain Leads EU GDP but Living Standards Lag Behind**\nEurostat\u2019s latest \"consumo individual efectivo\" indicator shows that Spain\u2019s aggregate value added from goods, services, public aid and welfare services remains eight points below the EU average, despite a 3.5\u202f% GDP growth in 2024 that matches Denmark and is only behind Croatia. The indicator also reveals that Spain\u2019s living standard is 26 points below Germany\u2019s, 14 points below France\u2019s and 6 points below Italy\u2019s, placing Spain 15th in the EU ranking of 27 countries. The article attributes the persistent gap to a higher inflation rate over the past three years and a significant rise in fiscal pressure: the tax burden on households is projected to reach 39\u202f% of GDP this year, up from 34\u202f% before the S\u00e1nchez administration, with the bulk of the increase falling on workers. The combined social security and IRPF contributions now account for 40.2\u202f% of a single, child\u2011free worker\u2019s gross salary. A recent Funcas study is quoted as saying that \u2018el IRPF ha frenado el crecimiento de la renta real neta media de los hogares espa\u00f1oles\u2019, underscoring that Spanish households have not regained the pre\u20112008 real purchasing power.

However, the article argues that this growth largely stems from increased public spending and does not translate into real welfare gains for households.  Key indicators show a decline in foreign investment, rising consumer\u2011basket prices, a surge in housing costs, and a reduction in disposable income after high tax burdens and social security contributions.  Youth unemployment remains one of the highest in Europe, general unemployment stays above chronic thresholds, and more than 2.3\u202fmillion people depend on the Minimum Income Benefit to make ends meet.  The poverty index is expanding, pushing more Spaniards toward exclusion.  The Bank of Spain projects that 2026 GDP growth will be half of 2023\u2019s level, hampered by rising labor costs, while both the Bank of Spain and AIReF note Spain\u2019s failure to meet EU public\u2011spending commitments despite a 12\u202f% rise in the IRPF last year.  The government\u2019s rhetoric that Spain is \"the best economy on the planet\" relies on percentages that mask the daily reality of millions, where wage increases are swallowed by inflation, a lack of IRPF deflation, and higher taxes.  In short, macro\u2011economic statistics paint a picture of dynamism, yet many Spaniards live poorer than before, and the 2.7\u202f% growth is a mirage that does not hide the widening poverty gap.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/otr-press/firmas/carmentomas/noticia-carmen-tomas-triunfalismo-no-llega-hogares-20250921080048.html)\n\n**Eurozone GDP and employment rise 0.1%**\nEurostat data show the eurozone economy grew 0.1% in the second quarter of 2025, while the EU grew 0.2% in the same period.

The GDP of the 20 countries that share the euro grew by 0.1% in the quarter, exceeding expectations of no change, as Spain, France, and Ireland continued to grow above expectations, offsetting the weakness of Germany and Italy, according to Eurostat data published on Wednesday. In comparison with the second quarter of the previous year, the economy of the block grew by 1.4%, above the expected 1.2%. Although the data still indicates a significant deceleration compared to the 0.6% expansion in the first quarter, that figure was skewed by pre-anticipated imports from US companies before the implementation of new tariffs and did not reflect the real economic strength. However, if examined together, the two first quarters indicate resilience, supported by the latest PMI reading, which showed that business activity accelerated more rapidly than expected, driven by a solid improvement in services and the continued recovery of the manufacturing industry. Spain continued to stand out, with a quarterly expansion of 0.7%, while French growth, at 0.3%, also exceeded the average. On the other hand, Italy and Germany retreated by 0.1%, according to Eurostat data. Furthermore, the US reached a trade agreement with the European Union, reducing uncertainty and improving growth prospects, especially since agreements have also been reached with other major powers, such as Japan and the UK. Although these agreements involve higher tariffs, which could reduce eurozone growth by 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points annually, according to economist estimates, this impact has already been taken into account in most forecasts. Additionally, Germany plans to drastically increase its public spending from next year to finance infrastructure and defense, a growth stimulus that will compensate for much of the impact of the tariffs, economists argue. This economic resilience is a key factor why financial investors believe that the ECB is about to end its easing of borrowing costs after reducing its official interest rate to 2% over the past 13 months. Markets only see a 50% chance of another cut by December and a small possibility of interest rates starting to rise by the end of 2026 as the economy accelerates and price pressure begins to rise again, according to economists.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/economia/crecimiento-zona-euro-mantiene-mejor-previsto-2t-20250730-770434.html)\n\n**Eurozone Economy Exceeds Expectations with 0.1% GDP Growth in Q2 2025**\nThe European Statistical Office (Eurostat) released the preliminary Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the European Union (EU) and the Eurozone.

In the first quarter of 2025, seasonally adjusted GDP grew by 0.6% compared to the previous quarter, and by 1.5% compared to the same quarter last year. This is a faster pace of growth than expected, which was 0.3% and 1.2% respectively. The European Central Bank's president, Christine Lagarde, has suggested that a pause in interest rate cuts may be justified in July. According to Eurostat, the growth was driven by investments and exports, which has strengthened expectations that the ECB will take a more cautious approach to further interest rate cuts. 'The economy of the eurozone has achieved better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2025, with growth driven mainly by investments and exports, which has strengthened expectations that the ECB will take a more cautious approach to further interest rate cuts,' Eurostat said. In comparison, the US GDP fell by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter, and grew by 2.1% compared to the same quarter last year. The highest growth rate in the eurozone was recorded in Ireland (+9.7%), followed by Malta (+2.1%) and Cyprus (+1.3%). Poland recorded a growth rate of +0.7%, ranking it fourth among the countries that exceeded the average.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 10:26 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/gospodarka/polska-gospodarka-rosnie-ponad-srednia-unijna-jest-zaskoczenie/lzb06qs)\n\n**Euro Area GDP Rises 0.6% in Q1 2025, Despite Uncertainty Over Trump Tariffs**\nThe European Union's Eurostat agency has reported that the euro area's GDP (PIL) increased by 0.6% on a quarterly basis and 1.5% on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This is an upward revision from the preliminary estimate of 0.4% on a quarterly basis and 1.2% on an annual basis. The data was released after the European Central Bank (BCE) announced its eighth interest rate cut since June 6, 2024, as part of its efforts to combat high inflation in the eurozone. The BCE also updated its economic growth projections for 2025-2027, forecasting a real GDP growth rate of 0.9% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026, and 1.3% in 2027. According to the Eurotower, 'the unchanged growth projection for 2025 reflects a more vigorous first quarter performance than expected, associated with weaker prospects for the rest of the year.' While there is some uncertainty about the impact of Trump's tariffs on the euro area's economy, the BCE believes that the increase in real incomes and a robust labor market will allow households to spend more, and that favorable financing conditions will increase the economy's resilience to global shocks. However, the BCE also presented a worst-case scenario in which the impact of Trump's tariffs is more severe than expected.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 09:16 AM\nSource:[Money.it](https://www.money.it/pil-euro-i-trimestre-rivisto-al-rialzo-ma-attenti-al-worst-case-scenario-della-bce-con-dazi-trump)\n\n**Eurozone GDP Growth Accelerates to 0.6% in First Quarter of 2025**\nThe eurozone's GDP growth accelerated to 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025, more than double the 0.3% recorded in the last quarter of 2024. This is the highest growth rate in the region since the third quarter of 2022, according to Eurostat's latest revised data. In comparison to the same period last year, the eurozone's GDP grew by 1.5%, while the EU's GDP grew by 1.6%. The largest increases in GDP were seen in Ireland (+9.7%), Malta (+2.1%), and Cyprus (+1.3%), while the largest decreases were observed in Luxembourg (-1%), Slovenia (-0.8%), Denmark, and Portugal (both -0.5%). The major EU economies, such as Germany (+0.4%), France (+0.1%), Italy (+0.3%), and Spain (+0.6%), also showed growth. In contrast, the US GDP decreased by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter. The European Central Bank's latest macroeconomic projections, published on Thursday, forecast an average GDP growth of 0.9% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026, and 1.3% in 2027.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/economia/macroeconomia-00338/noticia-eurozona-acelero-expansion-06-primer-trimestre-anticipacion-aranceles-20250606110052.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a clear consensus that Spain is highly likely to outgrow the Eurozone between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, but with a declining margin relative to previous years. All forecasters point to Spain\u2019s substantial growth advantage in recent quarters\u2014driven by a robust labor market, immigration, strong services/tourism, and effective absorption of EU recovery funds\u2014as a reason for continued outperformance. However, they also emphasize growing headwinds: mean reversion dynamics ('payback' after catch-up growth), structural issues (high unemployment, low productivity, material deprivation), diminishing returns from EU stimulus, and forecasts of a moderate recovery in major Eurozone economies (Germany, France, Italy), which could narrow the growth gap. Most institutional forecasts and panel projections (Spanish government, FUNCAS, ECB, Barclays) expect Spain\u2019s 2025 growth in the 2.7\u20132.8% range and the Eurozone\u2019s at about 1.1\u20131.2%, suggesting Spain\u2019s lead is likely to persist for this window. Scenario analysis across all experts suggests that only a sharp and unexpected Spanish slowdown combined with a rapid Eurozone rebound could produce a no outcome, which most view as improbable given current data and structural inertia. No experts foresee an abrupt divergence reversal, though all caution the gap will likely narrow going forward. All forecasters independently arrived at a 76% probability for Spain to outgrow the Eurozone over the stated period, reflecting high but not overwhelming confidence, with the primary risks being a sharper-than-expected Spanish deceleration or stronger-than-expected Eurozone core recovery.",
