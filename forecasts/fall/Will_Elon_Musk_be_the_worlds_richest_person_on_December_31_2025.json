The only challenger with a credible chance, Larry Ellison, briefly overtook Musk due to a company-specific surge, but failed to sustain it. Furthermore, the base rate for the richest person changing hands within a single quarter\u2014especially when the lead exceeds $100 billion\u2014is extremely low. Tech equity volatility remains high, but Musk\u2019s combination of diversified public and private assets, recent positive corporate actions, and a lack of near-term existential threats to his businesses or assets means that the likelihood of a flip on the exact date of December 31 is low. There remains tail risk related to regulatory, legal, or competitive surprises, but these are not visible or imminent based on data and news provided. Bloomberg\u2019s methodology is also relatively sticky for large fortunes unless a major asset markdown is triggered. Historically, the richest person rarely loses the top position without an extended, sustained reversal in net worth trajectories. Therefore, Musk being the world\u2019s richest person, according to Bloomberg on December 31, 2025, is much more probable than not.",

This forecast underweights the idiosyncratic, non-systematic risk specific to Tesla and Musk himself, evidenced by multiple recent and historical drawdowns (think, for instance, Tesla Q1 2023 or late 2022, and the reputational consequences of Musk\u2019s polarizing public persona). Private asset valuation \"buffers\" can act as a double-edged sword: in event of sudden, high-visibility failure or repricing, Bloomberg may be forced to mark down SpaceX or xAI far faster than the Forbes team would, as Bloomberg is sometimes more reactive day-to-day in its methodology. Moreover, the tail risks of a late-year collapse or negative legal event affecting Musk specifically (recall, e.g., the 2018 SEC episode) warrant slightly more caution with a shorter time frame and a higher volatility asset mix. In sum, while the probability of a Musk dethronement remains low, a 93% estimate underrepresents the real risk posed by high-leverage tech equity and private/illiquid assets compared to, for example, Ellison\u2019s Oracle holdings. A point estimate in the upper 80s seems more defensible given recent events and historical variance at the very top of the billionaire rankings."

First, Musk's broad asset base\u2014spanning public and rapidly appreciating private assets\u2014provides meaningful insulation compared to prior leaders more reliant on a single public equity (like Bezos during Amazon's turbulent stretches). Second, Musk\u2019s own actions (buybacks, CEO role reaffirmation, strategic compensation structuring) have reinforced market confidence and reduced downside scenarios in the short run. While the chance of a legal or regulatory bombshell can't be discounted, Bloomberg's methodology (as evident in the latest index responses) tends to be relatively inertial absent a sustained, material event\u2014meaning short news-cycle hit pieces or moderate regulatory action are unlikely to cut Musk from #1 in a compressed 2.5 month window. Finally, the probability range (75\u201385%) seems slightly on the low side given the substantial current lead and the compressed window; it overweights generic market tail risks versus the more relevant, empirically rare idiosyncratic shocks at this scale in contemporary rankings."

By explicitly grounding risk in sectoral volatility and disruptive innovation feedback loops, their rationale strengthens the group\u2019s caution and reflects the real-world dynamics that drive such rare, but not impossible, billionaire ranking upsets.

The focus on 'behavioral inertia' may thus understate not only the volatility factor inherent in disruptive tech, but also the specific competitive moves or market developments (such as an AI/cloud supercycle for Oracle or negative revelations for Tesla) that can produce dramatic, idiosyncratic outcomes around year-end. These are especially salient given the market\u2019s heightened narrative sensitivity during reporting periods, and the single-day reversals in lead already observed in September.

The pronounced lead in net worth Musk holds is not just the product of VRIN resources; the behavioral momentum around his persona and firms further strengthens the insulation against sudden upsets. After all, ranking reversals within a single quarter, when the lead is $100B+, are exceedingly rare historically, and behavioral feedback loops (investor FOMO, self-reinforcing media coverage, institutional reluctance to downgrade a 'winner') can mute the impact of negative news in the absence of outright catastrophe. The recent Ellison episode underscores that, outside of an extreme, perfectly-timed convergence of a Musk-specific crash and a rival super-rally, the Musk narrative\u2014and the market\u2019s tendency to anchor to it\u2014creates resistance to rapid dethronement. Therefore, while caution is merited, discounting these behavioral and narrative-based tailwinds arguably leads to underestimating Musk\u2019s real resilience: a probability in the low-to-mid 80s may better reflect the status quo, behavioral anchoring, and high switching cost in the #1 billionaire slot across such a compressed window."

These tail risks, though individually low probability, collectively suggest that a trimmed, upper-80s estimate is more prudent\u2014particularly given December\u2019s history of sharp swings, rebalancing, and reporting-driven surprises.

The consensus is clear: the magnitude of Musk's current lead ($100B+), the time horizon (under 3 months), and the co-movement of the largest tech fortunes all strongly favor persistence at the top. Importantly, group deliberations reinforced the behavioral finance perspective\u2014anchoring effects and narrative stickiness\u2014in addition to the base-rate-backed 'stickiness' of the #1 slot when such a margin exists. Most critiques of more extreme probabilities (low or high) focused on the non-negligible, but still small, possibility of an outlier Musk-specific event (private asset markdown, governance shock, tie-breaking scenario). The most compelling points for slight upward revision came from group arguments that behavioral and organizational momentum, as well as institutional inertia, add insulation beyond what pure volatility would suggest. At the same time, justified critiques argued that Musk's unique asset risk (Tesla, SpaceX, xAI) and the historical example of a single-day reranking (Ellison's brief #1) preclude assigning near-total certainty. Summing up, while my original estimate was reasonable, the group dynamics and reinforcement of status-quo probabilities\u2014plus the psychological tailwinds favoring Musk\u2014support a modest upward revision.",

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the top 10 billionaires lost a combined US$ 68.8 billion. Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest individual, led the losses with a US$ 15.8 billion decline in his fortune. Jeff Bezos lost US$ 10.2 billion, Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) lost US$ 9.67 billion, and Jensen Huang (Nvidia) lost US$ 8 billion. The sell-off was driven by Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls on critical U.S.-made software, effective November 1, 2025. U.S. tech stocks\u2014Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)\u2014fell approximately 5%, collectively erasing US$ 770 billion in market value. The Nasdaq dropped 3.6% and the S&P 500 fell 2.7%, marking their worst day since April 2024.

Jensen Huang rose from No. 9 to No. 7, gaining $10.7 billion as Nvidia's valuation hit $4.5 trillion amid surging AI chip demand.

His estimated wealth reached $500 billion before a slight dip due to market fluctuations, with Tesla\u2019s valuation exceeding $1.5 trillion. Musk\u2019s wealth is composed of approximately $180 billion from Tesla (~12% ownership), $160+ billion from SpaceX (~42% ownership), and $75+ billion from xAI (majority stake). A proposed $1 trillion stock-based pay package from Tesla\u2019s board is conditional on future production and revenue targets, potentially making Musk the world\u2019s first trillionaire. SpaceX, valued at around $400 billion, continues to grow through space exploration, satellite launches, and defense contracts. Despite volatility\u2014Musk lost over $70 billion in early 2025 due to political controversies and Tesla\u2019s stock downturn\u2014his net worth rebounded after he disengaged from political disputes. His fortune reflects the risks and rewards of wealth tied to innovation in tech, space, and artificial intelligence.

Of these, 23 saw a decrease in wealth. However, Indian billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani saw their net worth increase.

Ambani\u2019s wealth grew by $6.85 billion and Adani\u2019s by $10.1 billion year-to-date. The Indian stock market also performed strongly, with the BSE Sensex rising 328 points to close at a higher level.

Thiel made this statement during a private lecture in San Francisco as part of the 'Antichrist' program, according to TASS. He argued that Musk, who is considered the wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of $485 billion, should not participate in the pledge, which requires donating a significant portion of one's wealth to charity during life or through a will. 'Your money will go to left-leaning non-profit organizations chosen by Gates,' Thiel told Musk directly. Musk joined the Giving Pledge in 2012, which has since attracted over 240 major entrepreneurs and business leaders from 29 countries, including Michael Bloomberg, George Lucas, David Rockefeller, and Mark Zuckerberg. Thiel\u2019s warning comes amid reports of a sharp rise in leadership turnover at Musk\u2019s companies, particularly among key AI and robotics specialists. Additionally, following the deterioration of relations between Donald Trump and Elon Musk last summer, leaders from Meta and OpenAI have reportedly sought ways to reestablish ties with the U.S. president.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:59 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/55438856-soratnik-trampa-til-rekomendoval-masku-ne-zhertvovat-sostoyanie-v-giving-pledge-geytsa/)\n\n**The richest people of September 2025: Elon Musk rockets to $490bn, while Bezos takes a billion-dollar dive**\nIn September 2025, the world's top 10 billionaires collectively gained $201 billion, bringing their combined net worth to $2.3 trillion as of October 1, 2025, driven by record-high US stock markets.

A proposed $1 trillion stock-based pay package from Tesla\u2019s board is conditional on future production and revenue targets, potentially making Musk the world\u2019s first trillionaire. SpaceX, valued at around $400 billion, continues to grow through space exploration, satellite launches, and defense contracts. Despite volatility\u2014Musk lost over $70 billion in early 2025 due to political controversies and Tesla\u2019s stock downturn\u2014his net worth rebounded after he disengaged from political disputes. His fortune reflects the risks and rewards of wealth tied to innovation in tech, space, and artificial intelligence. While Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly challenged Musk\u2019s ranking, Forbes currently lists Musk as the world\u2019s richest person, underscoring the dynamic nature of modern wealth in technology-driven markets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 01:47 AM\nSource:[el-balad.com](https://www.el-balad.com/2020291)\n\n**Elon Musk Remains World's Richest as Ellison Surges to Second in 2025 Bloomberg Billionaires Index**\nAs of September 30, 2025, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla (TSLA.US), remained the world's richest person with a net worth of $459 billion, an increase of nearly $27 billion year-to-date. Tesla's stock closed at $459.46 on Wednesday, its highest level since December 24, 2021. On September 10, 2025, Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle (ORCL.US), briefly surpassed Musk in net worth due to a stock surge driven by strong earnings, reaching $405 billion. However, by the end of the day, Musk's net worth rebounded to $384 billion, slightly ahead of Ellison's $383 billion. Despite this, Ellison's wealth rose by $148 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, making him the top-gaining billionaire and securing second place globally. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Meta (META.US), saw his wealth grow to $258 billion due to a 23% stock increase, placing him third. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon (AMZN.US), saw only a 1.2% stock gain, with investor concerns over AWS market share and a $100 million AI capital expenditure plan, keeping his net worth at $243 billion and dropping to fourth. Meanwhile, Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, saw his wealth fall by $5 billion due to a 6% decline in luxury goods demand, dropping from fifth to eighth. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, saw his net worth decline from $159 billion to $122 billion after announcing a $200 billion donation pledge over 20 years in May 2025, falling from ninth to fifteenth place.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 11:37 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/hkstock/hkstocknews/2025-10-03/doc-infsqhuu5487015.shtml)\n\n**Elon Musk may become World's First Trillionaire; Check 2025 Richest People list - Pakistan Observer**\nElon Musk has become the first person in history to reach a net worth of $459 billion, according to the 2025 World Richest Persons list published by Pakistan Observer. This milestone, confirmed by Forbes\u2019 Real-Time Billionaires tracker, places Musk $150 billion ahead of second-place Larry Ellison, who has a net worth of $340 billion. Musk\u2019s wealth surge is driven by three major ventures: Tesla, which contributed an estimated $9.3 billion in value after a 4% stock increase; SpaceX, valued at $400 billion with Musk owning a 42% stake worth $168 billion; and xAI Holdings, a merged AI venture with X (formerly Twitter), valued at $113 billion and worth $60 billion to Musk due to his 53% ownership. Musk\u2019s rise has been rapid: from $24.6 billion in March 2020, he crossed $100 billion in August 2020, became the world\u2019s richest person in January 2021, and reached $400 billion by December 2024. The first trillionaire in history may be within reach by March 2033, when the initial vesting date of Musk\u2019s $1 trillion Tesla pay package occurs. Despite his immense wealth, Musk has expressed greater focus on control than on financial metrics. The 2025 ranking lists Musk at No. 1, followed by Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg ($258B), Jeff Bezos ($243B), Larry Page ($213B), Sergey Brin ($200B), Steve Ballmer ($178B), Bernard Arnault ($172B), Jensen Huang ($162B), and Warren Buffett ($151B).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[pakobserver.net](https://pakobserver.net/elon-musk-may-become-worlds-first-trillionaire-check-2025-richest-people-list/)\n\n**Elon Musk becomes world's first half-trillionaire - for a few hours**\nElon Musk became the first person in history to reach a net worth of at least $500 billion on October 2, 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks the wealth of the world\u2019s richest 500 individuals. His net worth briefly peaked at $500 billion before falling to $470 billion by the end of the day, a $10.5 billion increase in a single day, driven by a 3.3% rise in Tesla shares and a further 0.7% gain in pre-market trading. Musk owns a 12\u201313% stake in Tesla, and future performance-based compensation could significantly increase his holdings, potentially making him a trillionaire if certain milestones are met. His wealth is bolstered by ownership of SpaceX, The Boring Company, and xAI, with some private ventures seeing higher valuations in 2025. Despite Tesla\u2019s challenges in European sales and rising competition from Chinese EV makers, its shares have risen over 70% in the past six months, though they remain slightly below the December 2024 record high. Musk briefly lost the title of the world\u2019s richest person to Larry Ellison of Oracle in early September, when Ellison\u2019s net worth briefly surged to $349 billion.

Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, became the first person ever valued at over $400 billion in December. Tesla's stock rose approximately 4% on Wednesday, increasing Musk's fortune by $9.3 billion. The stock price reached $459.46 by the end of the trading session, nearing all-time highs. Since January 1, Tesla shares have risen 13.8%, and over the past 12 months, they have increased by 78.1%, with a 89.5% gain over the last three years. Forbes notes that if Musk maintains this pace, he could become the world\u2019s first trillionaire by March 2033. Musk, who was the largest donor to Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, concluded his role as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in late May. A public dispute between Musk and Trump occurred over tax cuts and government spending. At the current Tesla share price, Musk leads second-place Larry Ellison of Oracle, whose wealth is valued at $350.7 billion.

His wealth surge is largely driven by a 35% increase in Tesla\u2019s stock price since early September, which rose to $460 per share. On a single day, Musk\u2019s fortune grew by $10 billion, making him the leading candidate to become the world\u2019s first trillionaire. While Forbes values Musk at $500 billion, Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $459 billion, reflecting methodological differences: Forbes uses more conservative valuations, while Bloomberg adjusts for daily market volatility. Musk\u2019s wealth is not solely tied to Tesla; significant portions stem from private ventures like SpaceX, valued at over $210 billion, and xAI, his AI startup competing with OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The top global fortunes are increasingly concentrated in technology, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms\u2014sectors that have dominated stock market value creation over the past decade. Tesla\u2019s market capitalization now exceeds $1.4 trillion, making it the world\u2019s most valuable automaker, surpassing traditional giants like Toyota and Volkswagen. Larry Ellison (Oracle) ranks second with $340\u2013349 billion, Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) third with $246\u2013258 billion, and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) fourth with around $240 billion.

His Tesla compensation package, based on market performance targets and valued in tens of billions, has drawn criticism from corporate governance bodies and even Pope Leo XIV, who called it 'a distortion of the value of human labor.'

Forbes reported Musk's net worth increased by about $10 billion from Tuesday to Wednesday, citing its 'Real-Time Billionaires' rankings, which use interviews and annual research. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which updates daily using stock prices and financial ratios, placed Musk's net worth at $459 billion. Differences in methodology\u2014such as Forbes applying larger discounts and Bloomberg adjusting for taxes and market swings\u2014explain the discrepancy. Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, was ranked second wealthiest by both publications, with Forbes valuing him at $349.1 billion and Bloomberg at $340 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) was valued at $246.7 billion by Forbes and $258 billion by Bloomberg. Jeff Bezos (Amazon) ranked fourth with $233.6 billion per Forbes and $243 billion per Bloomberg. Musk's wealth is primarily derived from ownership stakes in privately held companies like SpaceX and xAI, as well as early investments in PayPal. He previously led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Trump but returned to full-time business activities in May 2025.

This move reinforces his confidence in Tesla, the company he founded and led for over two decades, and sends a strong signal to investors about the future of electric vehicles and autonomous driving. The purchase coincided with a new executive compensation package approved by Tesla's board on September 5, 2025, which could be worth up to $900 billion if Musk achieves ambitious goals over the next decade, including an eightfold increase in Tesla's market value, deployment of one million autonomous taxis, large-scale production of humanoid robots, and a 24-fold increase in profits, while remaining CEO for at least 10 years. The market reacted positively, with Tesla's stock rising nearly 7% on the news. The purchase is interpreted as both a show of commitment to Tesla's strategic vision and a defensive strategy to strengthen Musk's control amid intensifying competition from companies like BYD, Rivian, Lucid Motors, Ford, and General Motors, as well as regulatory challenges in China and Europe. Musk's broader influence is also underscored by his roles as CEO of SpaceX and owner of X (formerly Twitter), and his $1 billion share buyback helped him reclaim the top spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index after briefly losing it to Larry Ellison.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 07:48 PM\nSource:[diarioelnacionalista.com](https://diarioelnacionalista.com/2025/09/15/elon-musk-compra-acciones-de-tesla-por-1-000-millones-de-dolares/)\n\n**Elon Musk's mentor, Larry dislodges him as world's richest person**\nOn September 4\u202f2025, Oracle\u2019s shares surged more than 40% after better\u2011than\u2011expected earnings, lifting the company\u2019s market value to $958\u202fbillion at $340 per share.

Jeff Bezos is listed as the fourth\u2011richest, while Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Steve Ballmer, Jensen Huang, Bernard Arnault, and Warren Buffett round out the top ten.  Musk\u2019s fortune is tied to Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company, and he is noted for holding 15\u202fmillion Tesla shares.  Ellison\u2019s wealth of $280.1\u202fbillion comes largely from Oracle and his Tesla stake.  Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook empire grew from a campus project to a global social\u2011media platform.  Bezos\u2019s Amazon began as a garage startup in 1994 and now dominates e\u2011commerce.

    "summary": "All experts agree that Elon Musk is currently the world's richest person with a very large lead\u2014typically over $100 billion\u2014over his nearest challengers (mainly Larry Ellison), per Bloomberg and Forbes data as of October 2025. The panel emphasizes that Musk's fortune is highly concentrated in Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI, which bring both substantial upside from innovation/market optimism and significant downside risk due to sector volatility, regulatory threats, and market sentiment. \n\nExperts identify risks that could dethrone Musk, such as a sharp and sustained drop in Tesla's stock (especially if combined with private asset markdowns or regulatory/legal crisis), paired with an extraordinary surge from a rival (e.g., Ellison or Zuckerberg benefiting from unexpected positive shocks in Oracle or Meta). Several also note the non-negligible risk of Bloomberg's methodology producing a tie (which would resolve as 'No') or of black-swan events (market/corporate/legal disasters). However, Musk's buffer is so large, and most rivals remain tech-exposed (thus suffering from systemic shocks alongside Musk), that the base rate for a change at the #1 spot over the next 2.5 months is historically very low.\n\nMost analyses highlight that Musk's current positioning is unusually robust: he holds a durable lead, private assets like SpaceX/xAI smooth volatility, and recent actions (buybacks, new pay packages) reinforce his stake. Short-lived past overtakings (like Ellison in September) have reversed quickly. Although experts allow for the possibility of extreme downside scenarios, these are viewed as low-probability over the remaining time frame. Final probabilities assigned by the experts cluster in the 78% to 93% range, with most judgments in the high 80s\u2014reflecting confidence that, barring an unforeseen catastrophic event or once-in-a-generation market shock, Elon Musk will end 2025 as the world\u2019s richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
