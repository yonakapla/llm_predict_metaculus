Given the tight time window, the risk is less than 50-50 but meaningfully elevated, particularly as at least one MP (e.g., Conservative Shannon Stubbs, currently on medical leave), appears at risk, and historical norms suggest instability does not end instantly after a major vote.

The window is short, and both the holiday calendar and reactive party discipline could clamp down on instability. Yet, when parliamentary margins are so thin and MPs are under such personal and professional pressure (including receipt of threats and public criticisms), it often takes only a small catalyst for precedence to breed repetition. Given recent historical events (two rapid departures in a divided caucus), the base rate for such a rapid repeat drops, but remains well above normal.

However, a strong countervailing force is the short forecast window\u2014just six weeks\u2014and the observable, swift moves by party leadership to clamp down on dissent. With attention turning toward the holidays and no scheduled confidence votes in the next week, political incentives to move may ebb slightly, and the shock of two high-profile departures could cause others to freeze. Overall, the odds for a further defection/resignation are nontrivial but below even odds: the pressure is there, but the window is tight, party mechanisms are mobilizing, and individual MPs may prefer to let the party leadership review or next policy battle clarify their choices.

However, historical base rates for such moves do not suggest a full collapse, and party apparatuses typically react to stem the tide temporarily. The proximity to the winter holidays and the leadership review in January may mildly decrease further imminent moves, as many MPs may wait to see the outcome of the January contest. Nonetheless, the probability remains meaningfully elevated by structural incentives, ongoing government efforts to woo MPs, and the evidence of real fissures in the main opposition.

Holiday timing further demobilizes any actionable plans: with Parliament going into recess, the incentives to jump ship before the leadership review (when a new leader could shift the entire dynamic) are weakened, not strengthened. Moreover, the emotional backlash and media onslaught against both Jeneroux and d'Entremont serve as highly effective cautionary tales\u2014virtually every recent Canadian cross-bencher has paid a public reputational cost. The arithmetic supports an elevated probability, but not one above 60%: most MPs are risk-averse, will wait for the dust to settle, and the six-week window means momentum will falter, not build. This is a classic case of over-updating on recent events, neglecting institutional inertia and the cooling function of the holiday break."

You assert the reward calculus for floor-crossers is 'just above threshold,' but that presumes both a predictably available reward (which the Liberals, by your own evidence, have already deployed twice) and an absence of new deterrence (which is plainly underway in both caucuses after the recent storm). Finally, you underplay the natural lull associated with recess; most MPs will see greater value in hedging and keeping options open into the post-leadership review phase.

The incentives you cite for crossing or quitting\u2014elite-level rewards, majority arithmetic\u2014have already been exploited, and the Liberals will find the next MP a much harder sell precisely because public blowback, media ambushes, and intra-party threats now get national attention. Parliamentary drift into recess further cools the environment: MPs know the leadership review could change everything, so only the extraordinarily impulsive would jump now instead of waiting.

The deterrent effect of public shaming and career-ending reputational damage is real, and your estimate seems to undervalue this, as well as the holiday brake on parliamentary action. The leadership review looming in January offers a clear rational moment to pause, not leap, and discounting that inflection point skews your projection.

You capture that while the risk is definitely above baseline, Canadian MPs are not lemmings, and the rational calculus is shot through with fear of backlash and uncertainty.

Yes, Canadian parties react and try to clamp down, but their ability to suppress movement in a minority, especially one this fractured and volatile, is limited. The suggestion that most MPs will simply 'wait out' the holidays and leadership review ignores both the recency of deep ideological splits (not just about leadership, but fundamental party direction) and the highly personal nature of pressure campaigns for floor-crossers. You also miss the point that Liberal incentives to strike for a majority\u2014right now\u2014are peaking, with promised rewards and targeted appeals already occurring. In short, your tethering to 'baseline' risk is overly academic; sometimes cascades do escalate, and when party discipline is already proven shaky, moderate odds like yours downplay real-world risk for the comfort of historical mean reversion.

Those arguing for higher probabilities over-emphasize short-term volatility and recent precedent without enough recognition of post-crisis consolidation. Defenses of lower probabilities (near my own, as in the Legislative Studies argument) reinforce the insight that after two dramatic moves, the system's response is typically to freeze rather than accelerate.

These countervailing factors, combined with party elites' post-defection lockdown and MPs' desire to hedge until after January, suggest the overall environment is less combustible than my initial forecast implied.

The NDP sought funding from new revenue and reallocation of spending, including from national defence, which receives nearly $82 billion over five years. Sources confirmed that the government did not seriously engage in negotiations, with former NDP official Anne McGrath stating the Liberals were 'going through the motions.' The government secured support through abstentions from two New Democrats (Gord Johns and Lori Idlout) and two Conservatives (Matt Jeneroux and Shannon Stubbs), while five NDP MPs voted against the budget. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet criticized the government for failing to build alliances, warning that future parliamentary battles would be difficult and suggesting a general election could occur as early as next spring. Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne defended the budget as addressing key issues like housing, infrastructure, and defence.

Two senior Conservatives, MPs Andrew Scheer and Scott Reid, claimed their electronic voting app failed and requested to vote against the budget minutes before the vote concluded, but only cast their votes after all other members had finished. Video footage showed individuals behind curtains on the Conservative side during the vote count, though Scheer's chief of staff denied it was him or Reid. The budget passed due to two NDP abstentions and two Conservative absences\u2014Scheer and Reid did not vote, while MP Shannon Stubbs was on medical leave and unable to vote remotely due to facial recognition restrictions from a post-surgery apparatus. Despite Poilievre\u2019s strong opposition to the $78-billion deficit budget, he did not mention the two absent Conservatives in his public statement, instead framing the vote as a 'no' from the party. Former PM Brian Mulroney\u2019s chief of staff David McLaughlin suggested the Conservatives may have strategically manufactured the government\u2019s majority. The Liberals celebrated the outcome, with Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne stating Parliament was 'working,' and Carney calling it 'a great day for Canadians.'

The outcome hinged on two abstentions each from the Conservative and NDP parties; had they voted with their party lines, the budget would have failed. Former senior advisor to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Supriya Dwivedi, argues that this narrow passage reflects poorly on Carney, labeling him a 'political rookie' in a minority Parliament. She emphasizes that in such a context, the government must actively seek opposition support, not assume it. The government delayed consulting opposition leaders until October 21, when interim NDP leader Don Davies publicly criticized the lack of engagement. Although Carney later met with all opposition leaders, the delay raises concerns about strategic prioritization. Dwivedi suggests the government may have bet on attracting disaffected Conservative MPs\u2014such as floor crosser Chris D'Entremont\u2014to secure support, but this strategy failed. She warns that Carney cannot rely solely on moderate Conservatives; he must also compromise with progressive allies, including within his own caucus, to advance his agenda. The article notes that while Carney is an accomplished economist, political effectiveness requires the art of compromise, which he has yet to demonstrate. The Bank of Canada\u2019s recent message underscored that fiscal policy, not monetary policy alone, is now essential for economic progress, placing greater responsibility on political leaders like Carney.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 04:52 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/the-budget-just-barely-passing-shows-that-mark-carney-is-a-still-a-political-rookie/article_f8e5d090-539f-4052-9687-c3aa9a5f2793.html)\n\n**Beyond Local: Liberal budget survives in tight House vote before Carney departs for UAE**\nPrime Minister Mark Carney's minority government narrowly survived a crucial confidence vote in the House of Commons on November 18, 2025, passing 170 to 168.

The plan includes investments in ports and trade infrastructure to double Canadian exports to non-US markets within a decade and provides direct support to businesses affected by US tariffs, with the government projecting C$1 trillion in private sector investment over the same period. To balance the budget, Carney has proposed a 10% reduction in the federal workforce, a move criticized by public sector employees who warn it could slow government operations. The budget, first introduced in early November 2025, survived two prior votes. Debate was overshadowed by partisan drama, including the defection of Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont of Nova Scotia, who cited Pierre Poilievre's 'negative' political style and stated the Liberal budget aligns with his constituents' priorities. Another Conservative MP, Matt Jeneroux of Alberta, resigned the same week to focus on family. These departures raised questions about Poilievre\u2019s leadership, but he affirmed his intention to remain as leader, stating his goal is to lead 'the only leader that's fighting for an affordable Canada where our people who work hard can afford a home and food.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 12:34 AM\nSource:[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8531xvy26o)\n\n**Canadian Prime Minister Faces Crucial Budget Vote That Could Trigger New Election**\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney faces a crucial parliamentary vote on his first budget, with a defeat potentially triggering a second federal election in less than a year. Carney's Liberals hold a narrow majority in the 343-seat House of Commons, requiring support or abstention from opposition MPs to pass the budget. Although Carney appears secure, the left-wing New Democrats\u2014having lost nearly three-quarters of their seats in the April election\u2014have signaled they will not overthrow him, due to financial constraints and lack of a permanent leader. A senior Liberal source told the Globe and Mail that the government expected a narrow victory. If the budget fails, Carney could call a new election or negotiate a deal with the New Democrats, potentially securing their support in exchange for increased social spending, similar to the two-and-a-half-year agreement between Justin Trudeau and the New Democrats. Recent polls suggest the Liberals would retain power in a new election. The Conservative Party, the official opposition, is experiencing internal divisions after its April defeat, and leader Pierre Poilievre faces a formal performance review in January. Carney\u2019s budget, an economic plan for the next fiscal year, proposes doubling the fiscal deficit to counter U.S. tariffs and fund defense and housing programs. While it includes a reduction in federal government employees, it contains fewer austerity measures than feared.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 04:56 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/news/economy-news/premie-do-canada-enfrenta-votacao-crucial-sobre-orcamento-que-pode-provocar-eleicao-1748703)\n\n**Two Conservative MPs are gone.

Carney is now two seats short of a majority, and success in securing the budget will determine whether his government survives its first year. The political turmoil has been fueled by a defection: Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont announced he was considering joining the Liberals, later confirming his departure, which triggered panic in the Conservative caucus. Speculation followed that MP Matt Jeneroux might also cross the floor, but he instead announced his resignation from politics on Thursday, citing personal reasons and a desire to focus on his family. Jeneroux\u2019s office confirmed he had been in discussions with the Liberals and even spoke with Carney, though the Prime Minister\u2019s Office declined to comment. The Liberals claim Jeneroux was pressured by conservative bullying and threats, including death threats reported to the RCMP, while Conservative leaders like Andrew Scheer accused Carney of undemocratic backroom deals. Despite the chaos, the Conservatives rallied behind Leader Pierre Poilievre, who avoided media all week but later projected confidence in Toronto, vowing to broaden their base. Liberal MPs, including Judy Sgro and Mark Gerretsen, argue that Poilievre\u2019s populist leadership is driving progressive Conservatives away and that the party is fracturing. The outcome of the budget vote remains uncertain, with Carney needing two additional votes to pass the legislation; failure would trigger a snap election.

Their actions occurred amid growing internal dissent following Pierre Poilievre\u2019s controversial interview, in which he labeled the RCMP leadership 'despicable' and alleged unproven misconduct by Justin Trudeau. Poilievre had previously claimed unity within the party, but the defections exposed cracks in that narrative. d'Entremont cited a misalignment with the party\u2019s ideals and a desire to 'lead a country to try to make it better' rather than 'knock it down.' He described himself as a 'red Tory,' a moderate conservative, signaling a potential shift in the party\u2019s ideological direction. His move increased the Liberals\u2019 seat count to 170, while Jeneroux\u2019s resignation temporarily reduced the Opposition to 172 seats and opened a potentially winnable riding. Jeneroux denied coercion and stated he met with Liberal leader Mark Carney prior to his decision.

Jeneroux cited family time as his reason, rejecting claims of political pressure, which were denied by Poilievre\u2019s adviser Jenni Byrne. Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer accused the Liberals of using 'undemocratic means' and 'pressure tactics' to undermine the opposition. Despite the defections, MP Roman Baber and strategist Kory Teneycke affirmed the caucus remained united, with Teneycke noting floor-crossings are common in minority governments but still acknowledged the loss as damaging. Poilievre, speaking at the Economic Club of Canada in Toronto, avoided addressing internal drama and instead criticized Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s $140-billion spending plan over five years, calling it a threat to future generations and harmful to business investment. He argued for eliminating both regulatory barriers and subsidies, stating, 'My view is, let's do neither. Let's stop blocking our entrepreneurs.'

The government's budget passed two of three required confidence votes: on Thursday, the NDP and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois opposed a Conservative motion to reject the budget, and on Friday, Liberal MPs joined Conservatives in defeating a Bloc motion calling for rejection. The Liberals remain two votes short of a majority. The political instability followed the floor-crossing of Nova Scotia MP Chris d'Entremont to the Liberal caucus, citing dissatisfaction with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s leadership. His departure sparked backlash from former colleagues, including Andrew Scheer, who accused the Liberals of using 'undemocratic means' and 'pressure tactics' to destabilize the opposition. Late Thursday, Conservative MP Matt Jeneroux announced his resignation from Parliament, stating he had no coercion and that his decision was long-standing. He confirmed he had spoken with Poilievre and that his departure would likely occur in the spring. Liberal sources confirmed a private meeting between Carney and Jeneroux during question period, though Scheer denied the meeting occurred, claiming the Liberals were harassing Conservatives. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May declared the budget 'dead to me' but offered conditional support if stronger environmental commitments are added.

His resignation follows that of Nova Scotia MP Chris d'Entremont, who defected to the Liberals citing dissatisfaction with Poilievre\u2019s leadership. Poilievre publicly thanked Jeneroux for his service and suggested his official departure may be in spring 2026. Jeneroux confirmed his exit would occur 'this spring,' prompting a byelection in his Edmonton seat, which he won by a narrow five-point margin in April 2025. Conservative leadership has since worked to prevent further defections, including efforts by former campaign manager Jenni Byrne, and several MPs, including Quebec\u2019s Dominique Vien, have publicly reaffirmed their loyalty. Liberal sources acknowledge ongoing discussions with Conservative MPs, with Prime Minister Carney stating, 'We'll speak to anyone publicly or otherwise who can support us.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 03:35 PM\nSource:[CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-matt-jeneroux-resigns-9.6970100)\n\n**Down goes another**\nEdmonton Riverbend MP Matt Jeneroux announced his resignation from politics on November 7, 2025, just as Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre attempted a budget confidence vote to bring down Prime Minister Mark Carney's government. The news caused immediate chaos in the House of Commons, with MPs exchanging phones and reacting in shock during the vote, which ultimately failed. Jeneroux, who was not in Ottawa and abstained from voting on the opposition's subamendment, later clarified in two statements that his resignation was voluntary and driven by a desire to focus on family, with no coercion involved. Conservative MPs emphasized his personal reasons, distancing his departure from the recent floor-crossing of Chris D'Entremont, while Liberal officials suggested Poilievre's leadership style may be driving progressive MPs away. The resignation adds to Conservative Party instability, with Jeneroux being the second Conservative MP to resign in 48 hours. Meanwhile, the Liberal government is abandoning its comprehensive online harms bill, opting instead to split it into multiple legislative pieces across ministries, citing the need for more focused and effective legislation. Health Minister Marjorie Michel defended the culling of 300 ostriches on public health grounds after the Supreme Court of Canada rejected an appeal by Universal Ostrich Farms, despite public outcry and pressure from animal rights groups. The decision has sparked debate, with some Conservative MPs criticizing the CFIA\u2019s handling and lack of communication, while others, like Brad Vis, stressed that such decisions should be left to scientists. The government faces another confidence vote later that day via a Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois amendment to the budget, with the full budget to be voted on in mid-November after a parliamentary break. Prime Minister Carney is scheduled to speak at the Canadian Club Toronto and tour an AI research institute, while Poilievre delivers an economic keynote in Toronto. The article also notes broader political developments, including the retirement of Nancy Pelosi from Congress, Senate representative Pierre Moreau stepping down from his law firm, and media changes such as Heather Hiscott\u2019s departure from CBC\u2019s Morning Live. The article concludes with a Playbook-style summary of key political, policy, and cultural developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 06:03 AM\nSource:[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/canada-playbook/2025/11/07/matt-jeneroux-to-exit-conservatives-and-politics-altogether-00641629)\n\n**Carney government survives first of three budget votes as Conservatives face another MP departure**\nCanada's minority Parliament witnessed political upheaval on November 7, 2025, as Alberta Conservative MP Matt Jeneroux announced his resignation from Parliament just before the government survived its first confidence vote on the federal budget. The vote passed 198 to 139, with the Liberals, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, New Democrats, and the Green MP supporting the budget. The government treated the vote as a confidence matter, meaning defeat would have triggered a potential snap election. Jeneroux, who had previously denied defection rumors, did not confirm when he would resign but stated he would focus on family. Two days earlier, Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont had defected to the Liberals, increasing their seat count to 170\u2014two short of a majority. A Liberal source revealed the party had nearly convinced Jeneroux to cross the floor, though he ultimately chose not to. Jeneroux denied any pressure from Conservative leadership, including Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s office, which declined to confirm a meeting. Conservative insiders expressed disappointment, with one source criticizing Leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s leadership as too right-wing and lacking 'adults in the room,' citing Poilievre\u2019s recent criticism of the RCMP. The source described the caucus as 'subdued' and 'defeated' after d'Entremont\u2019s exit. Poilievre has not personally reached out to all MPs, according to the source, who said he has 'acquaintances, not friends.' Despite internal dissent, the source has no intention of leaving the party, hoping for a future leadership challenge. The Liberals now face a second confidence vote on Friday and a third on November 17, when the Bloc and likely the Greens will oppose the budget. The NDP, with seven members, could hold the balance of power; interim leader Don Davies has not yet declared their vote. The government needs 172 votes to pass the budget, but could succeed with fewer if opposition members abstain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 03:41 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/carney-government-survives-first-of-three-budget-votes-as-conservatives-face-another-mp-departure/article_8fbdc91d-040a-4ddf-aa37-d7fcdab56199.html)\n\n**Conservative MP announces resignation days after another crosses the floor**\nConservative MP Matt Jeneroux, representing Edmonton Riverbend, announced his resignation from Parliament, stating it was a difficult but necessary decision driven by his desire to spend more time with his family. His resignation follows the recent floor-crossing of Nova Scotia MP Chris d'Entremont to the Liberal Party, which left the Conservative government two seats short of a majority, jeopardizing its ability to pass the budget without opposition support. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre confirmed Jeneroux's departure would occur in spring 2026 and praised his decade of service. Jeneroux expressed admiration for all elected members of Parliament, stating their work sustains hope for a stronger, more unified Canada. He emphasized that his decision was not coerced and that he hopes to address the House of Commons one final time. Other Conservative MPs, including Garnett Genuis and Frank Caputo, publicly praised Jeneroux for his advocacy on mental health and the families affected by the downing of flight PS752. Quebec MP G\u00e9rard Deltell downplayed the significance of d'Entremont\u2019s departure, calling it isolated, while colleague Jacques Gourde remained uncertain about future defections. Jeneroux was first elected in 2015.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 03:21 AM\nSource:[coastreporter.net](https://www.coastreporter.net/national-news/conservative-mp-announces-resignation-days-after-another-crosses-the-floor-11457082)\n\n**Carney doesn't rule out more floor-crossing talks**\nChris d'Entremont, a Conservative MP representing a rural Nova Scotia riding with a military base and strong agricultural and fishery sectors, resigned from the Conservative caucus and joined the Liberals on November 5, 2025, following the release of Prime Minister Carney's budget. This floor-crossing brought Carney's government one step closer to a majority, now two seats away from securing a majority in the House of Commons. Carney stated that d'Entremont sought alignment between his values and the government's budget, which he found. The move was met with strong backlash from Conservatives: MP Aaron Gunn called it 'shameful,' MP Jamil Jivani labeled d'Entremont an 'idiot,' and the party accused him of betrayal. d'Entremont cited a lack of representation for his 'red Tory' and eastern Canadian ideals, stating that Pierre Poilievre's leadership style was incompatible with his values. He also referenced the awkwardness of not being backed by his caucus in his bid for deputy speaker earlier in the year, which he said contributed to his decision. Despite Conservative claims that the party is a 'big tent' welcoming centrist voices, d'Entremont emphasized that his progressive conservatism led to increasing alienation. Government Whip Mark Gerretsen confirmed that a seat has been reserved for d'Entremont in the House, specifically in the Liberal class of 2019. The Liberals have not disclosed whether they are pursuing additional floor-crossers. The Conservatives, while denying rumors of further defections, have been avoiding media and using back doors to enter caucus meetings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 04:57 PM\nSource:[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/chris-dentremont-mark-carney-conservative-liberal-defections-00637328)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts broadly agree that the likelihood of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before January 1, 2026, is significantly elevated due to recent events and the current parliamentary conditions, though estimates of probability vary. The principal drivers cited are the instability of the minority government, the active and public efforts by the Liberal Party to recruit opposition MPs, visible internal conflict and leadership instability within the Conservative Party (including an imminent leadership review and acute factionalism), and the recent high-profile departures of two Conservative MPs (one defection, one resignation). These factors are seen as raising the base rate for further defections or resignations, with recent moves potentially triggering a 'bandwagon' or contagion effect among other disaffected MPs.\n\nCountervailing factors include the short remaining time window (about six weeks), increased party discipline and defensive measures following the recent departures, heightened reputational and career risks for potential defectors (including harsh public and intra-party backlash), and the upcoming holiday recess which traditionally reduces political activity and pressure. Some experts note that party apparatuses often react quickly to plug leaks after an initial cluster, and some wavering MPs may prefer to wait until after the January leadership review or the holiday break to make moves.\n\nEstimates of probability for another MP departure range from about 37% to 43% among analysts stressing base rates, discipline, and the cooling-off effect, to 58%\u201372% among experts who see the political incentives and instability overriding deterrents. Nearly all agree that risks are notably higher than historical averages and that turbulence within the Conservative caucus\u2014in particular\u2014makes further movement plausible, though not guaranteed. The consensus scenario sees any additional defection or resignation most likely coming from a disaffected or moderate Conservative (possibly NDP), motivated by dissatisfaction with leadership, strategic career considerations, and/or government inducements before the window closes. The least likely outcome is a complete lockdown of party ranks with no further changes until the New Year.",
