While the war in June 2025 was unprecedented and the region is on a hair trigger, the immediate limited war seems to have passed its tipping point for wider intervention. Recent events show actors are deterred, preferring proxies or deniable moves. However, given (1) the magnitude of the recent conflict, (2) the possibility of further miscalculation or an overt action by a less stable government under popular/elite pressure (notably Syria, Iraq, or possibly a Lebanese government collapse), and (3) the knife-edge state of regional stability, the risk is not negligible.

The strongest historical pattern since 1973 is that, no matter the intensity of Israeli regional war, Arab states and Iran\u2019s other allies avoid entering directly. Israeli and US deterrent signals, and Russia/China's preference for non-involvement, reduce further the likelihood of formal military intervention by a new state.

The current situation features higher-than-normal tension and significant force mobilization, raising the tail risk slightly. However, clear US deterrence, exhausted regional actors, and a strong local preference for plausible deniability and proxy warfare dramatically lower the probability of states overtly, unambiguously acknowledging or being credibly attributed with new attacks during the resolution window. The main risk factors are miscalculation or a massive new provocation, but there is currently no direct evidence (per news reporting or military activity) of imminent overt attack plans by potential new entrants. The most likely pathway to a 'Yes' is an official Hezbollah/Lebanese government move, a Syrian miscalculation, or an Iraqi PMU over-calibration, but these are still low probability events. Accounting for increased volatility post-conflict, I adjust from a base of ~7% upward to 13% to incorporate heightened risk, but not enough clear indicators for a higher rating.

Mediation channels (US, Russia, China, EU, Gulf states) remain deeply engaged; escalation aversion is now even stronger, given demonstrated destructive capacity and unpredictable consequences. Even states most likely to escalate (Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Gulf states) are constrained by internal division, economic fragility, and clear US and international warnings about consequences. The most probable \u2018wild cards\u2019\u2014accidental or emotional retaliations by e.g., Qatar, Iraq, or Lebanese state forces\u2014are mitigated by these constraints and would only trigger the question if the action were publicly, officially owned or credibly attributed.

Factors that modestly raise risk\u2014namely regime instability, revisionist brinkmanship, or an accidental escalation\u2014are real but not new and thus unlikely to override decades of precedent, especially given the magnitude of destruction on both sides in recent months. The most likely vector for a 'Yes' is Turkish miscalculation or a Syrian/Iraqi border skirmish spiraling into something overt, but these are historically rare and regime interests remain strongly oriented toward avoiding open war. I see no compelling current evidence of preparations, public signaling, or political benefit that would override the steep costs and risks for other countries to intervene directly at this point.

While you mention tail risk from less stable governments (i.e., Iraq, Syria, Lebanon), it would strengthen your forecast to more robustly explore how internal state fragility and transnational/securitarian pressure may circumvent deterrence logics\u2014especially in scenarios where domestic legitimacy, not just external power balancing, becomes paramount. For example, multi-sectarian contestation or regime-destabilizing events triggered by external violence could drive state (not just proxy) missteps, particularly if a government feels its immediate survival or credibility among its population depends on overt action. While your 13% estimate is well-defended relative to base rates, the forecast could benefit from additional nuance on these undercurrents\u2014which may moderately boost or reduce the probability but certainly affect scenario richness."

Multiple forecasters, especially those drawing on Deterrence Theory and Intelligence Analysis, persuasively argue that while deterrence remains strong and the base rate low, the tail risk from accidental miscalculation, regime instability, or a one-off forced acknowledgment is modestly higher given recent events.

My own initial weighting incorporated both historical rarity and the new volatility, landing in consensus.

My own analysis, which weighs Regional Security Complex volatility and 'black swan' risk, aligns closely with these arguments for a low but not trivial estimate. However, engagement with the Diplomacy and Preventive Mediation perspective made me reconsider whether I've fully weighted the depth and efficacy of current diplomatic crisis management and international mediation, which may act as a real downward adjustment on risk. At the same time, the willingness of most forecasters to remain in the 10-13% bracket\u2014despite no acute warning indicators\u2014suggests that the systemic volatility is persistent, not just situational.

Critiques in deliberation offer two points possibly underweighted: (1) The severity and unprecedented nature of the June\u2013July escalation and direct US entry does likely raise the 'fat tail' risk of black swan events (e.g., a regime under pressure in Iraq or Syria miscalculates or claims an attack under duress); (2) historic regime and alliance shocks, though rare, can break with rational cost-benefit patterns in ways that pure sectarian/transnational logic might not entirely anticipate.

The IRGC emphasized that any new mistake or potential aggression from the enemy will be met with a harsher, more precise, and more devastating response than previous actions under Operation Sadiq Promise. On September 30, an Iranian official told the Mehr News Agency that there was no military activity in the region, and Iran's armed forces remained fully prepared. This came after an Israeli military official threatened a return to war with Iran following the activation of UN sanctions, claiming Israel and Iran are engaged in a regional arms race and that Israel is preparing for various scenarios, including a potential military response against Iran. The official asserted that Iran suffered a severe blow in the previous confrontation and fully understands the extent of the damage and Israel\u2019s military capabilities. In a surprise escalation, Israel launched a 12-day war against Iran on June 13 with U.S. support, targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites, assassinating military and nuclear scientists, and destroying infrastructure. Iran retaliated by striking Israeli military and intelligence facilities with ballistic missiles and drones, causing unprecedented destruction and panic, resulting in 28 deaths and 3,238 injuries, according to Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:55 AM\nSource:[Elnashra News](https://www.elnashra.com/news/show/1743959/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%20%D8%A3%D9%8A-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A3-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B3)\n\n**Israel Considers Launching a New Attack Against Iran**\nAccording to a senior Israeli military official, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are preparing for multiple scenarios, including the possibility of launching another attack against Iran. The official stated, 'We are closely monitoring developments across the Middle East and in Iran. Both Israel and Iran are engaged in an arms race and a learning process. We are preparing for various scenarios and possibilities, one of which is that we may need to act against Iran again.' The official added that Iran has suffered a significant blow from Israel and is fully aware of the extent of the damage and Israel's capabilities. Meanwhile, Mohsen Rezaei, former commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, warned in a state television interview that Iran would enter a war with the United States if Israel launches another attack, and emphasized that Tehran would not accept negotiations with Western countries that could allow Israel time to prepare or strengthen its position. This follows the '12-day war' that began on June 13, when Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military commanders, senior officials, and nuclear scientists\u2014many of whom were killed along with their families. The conflict escalated when the U.S. joined the assault, striking three major Iranian nuclear sites. In response, Iran attacked the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, located in Qatar. A ceasefire was announced on June 24, ending the hostilities between Tel Aviv and Tehran.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/567016-israel-evaluaria-lanzar-nuevo-ataque-iran)\n\n**Jeffrey Sachs Suggests U.S. Involvement in Conflict with Iran**\nAccording to Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist and professor at Columbia University, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may attempt to involve the United States in a military conflict with Iran. In an interview with journalist Tucker Carlson, Sachs stated that the likelihood of such a conflict is high, citing Netanyahu's consistent resolve on this issue over nearly thirty years. Sachs noted that Netanyahu has previously initiated U.S. military-political intervention in Iran's affairs and may seek to repeat this strategy. On the night of June 13, Israel launched a military operation against Iran, accusing Tehran of developing a secret nuclear weapons program. Targets included nuclear facilities, military leadership, prominent nuclear scientists, and airbases. Iran rejected the allegations and launched retaliatory strikes. For 12 days, both sides exchanged attacks, and the United States joined the conflict by conducting a single strike on Iranian nuclear sites on the night of June 22. On June 23, Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. military base Al-Udeid in Qatar, stating it did not seek further escalation. U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope that Iran's action was a way to release tension and that current events could lead to peace in the Middle East. He also announced that a ceasefire agreement had been reached between Israel and Iran, set to officially end the 12-day armed confrontation within 24 hours.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 01:06 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/dzheffri-saks-predpolagaet-vovlechenie-ssha-v-konflikt-s-iranom-706594.html)\n\n**Netanyahu Trying to Drag the U.S. into War with Iran, Expert Says**\nAccording to an expert, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is attempting to draw the United States into a war with Iran.

The IRGC emphasized that any new mistake or potential aggression from the enemy will be met with a harsher, more precise, and more devastating response than previous actions under Operation Sadiq Promise. On September 30, an Iranian official told the Mehr News Agency that there was no military activity in the region, and Iran's armed forces remained fully prepared. This came after an Israeli military official threatened a return to war with Iran following the activation of UN sanctions, claiming Israel and Iran are engaged in a regional arms race and that Israel is preparing for various scenarios, including a potential military response against Iran. The official asserted that Iran suffered a severe blow in the previous confrontation and fully understands the extent of the damage and Israel\u2019s military capabilities. In a surprise escalation, Israel launched a 12-day war against Iran on June 13 with U.S. support, targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites, assassinating military and nuclear scientists, and destroying infrastructure. Iran retaliated by striking Israeli military and intelligence facilities with ballistic missiles and drones, causing unprecedented destruction and panic, resulting in 28 deaths and 3,238 injuries, according to Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:55 AM\nSource:[Elnashra News](https://www.elnashra.com/news/show/1743959/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%20%D8%A3%D9%8A-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A3-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B3)\n\n**Israel Considers Launching a New Attack Against Iran**\nAccording to a senior Israeli military official, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are preparing for multiple scenarios, including the possibility of launching another attack against Iran.

We are preparing for various scenarios and possibilities, one of which is that we may need to act against Iran again.' The official added that Iran has suffered a significant blow from Israel and is fully aware of the extent of the damage and Israel's capabilities. Meanwhile, Mohsen Rezaei, former commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, warned in a state television interview that Iran would enter a war with the United States if Israel launches another attack, and emphasized that Tehran would not accept negotiations with Western countries that could allow Israel time to prepare or strengthen its position. This follows the '12-day war' that began on June 13, when Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military commanders, senior officials, and nuclear scientists\u2014many of whom were killed along with their families. The conflict escalated when the U.S. joined the assault, striking three major Iranian nuclear sites. In response, Iran attacked the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, located in Qatar.

The movement, described as unprecedented, signals a heightened U.S. military readiness in the region amid rising tensions following a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel and recent Israeli attacks on Qatari territory. The KC-135s are critical for aerial refueling, enabling long-range missions by U.S. fighter jets in the Persian Gulf. This deployment coincides with controversial statements by U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and former President Donald Trump\u2019s nuclear threats, as well as prior aircraft movements before the June U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While the Pentagon has not issued official statements, unconfirmed military sources cite a 'logistical reinforcement' in anticipation of a critical phase. Iran has responded with strong rhetoric, vowing to expand its missile capabilities and retaliate decisively, with former Revolutionary Guard commander Mohsen Rezaei stating that Iran would enter war with the U.S. if Israel attacks. The situation is further complicated by reports of U.S.-Israel joint plans for a large-scale military strike on Iran, including operations in southern Iran and control of the Persian Gulf. Simultaneously, the U.S. has pressured India to sever ties with Iran and abandon the Chabahar port, while a U.S. delegation visited Kabul amid internet blackouts by the Taliban. Iran has strengthened military ties with Russia and China, including missile technology transfers and Russian military flights. The article questions whether this represents strategic deterrence or a descent into open conflict, with Qatar\u2019s strategic role as the U.S. Central Command hub becoming increasingly central. The article also notes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was forced by Trump to publicly apologize to Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani after a prior attack on Doha, highlighting shifting regional dynamics.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[DAGOSPIA](http://www.dagospia.com/cronache/ci-strani-movimenti-cieli-mediorientali-gli-uniti-schierato-decine-449118)\n\n**Iran's Revolutionary Guards call to extend missile range in wake of war with Israel**\nIn response to Western demands to limit Iran's missile capabilities\u2014seen as a major obstacle to a nuclear deal\u2014Mohammadjafar Asadi, deputy inspector of the Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, stated that Iran will extend its missile range to any point deemed necessary. Iran currently self-imposes a 2,000-kilometer (1,200-mile) missile range, sufficient to reach Israel, but has increasingly launched missiles from eastern regions of the country following Israeli strikes on western launch sites in June 2024. Asadi claimed that the current missile range limited the June war to 12 days and implied that expanded range would enhance Iran\u2019s deterrence in future conflicts. The conflict was triggered by Israel\u2019s large-scale attack on Iran\u2019s military leadership, nuclear scientists, enrichment sites, and missile program, which Israel justified as preventing Iran\u2019s stated goal of destroying the Jewish state. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons but has enriched uranium to weapons-grade levels, obstructed international inspections, and expanded its ballistic missile program. In retaliation, Iran launched over 500 ballistic missiles and approximately 1,100 drones at Israel, resulting in 31 deaths, over 3,000 injuries, 36 missile impacts, one drone strike in populated areas, damage to 2,305 homes across 240 buildings, two universities, a hospital, and displacement of over 13,000 Israelis.

The book highlights Iran's persistent nuclear ambitions, including uranium enrichment and weapon development, which predated and continued beyond the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Black details how Iran received support from other nations and benefited from Western sanctions relief or non-enforcement, enabling its nuclear program. Despite widespread awareness of Iran's cheating, few acted. Black, an award-winning investigative journalist, traces the timeline of events from 2004 onward, including the development of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bunker buster, which was kept secret for over two decades by hundreds of U.S. Defense Department personnel and officials. The 2025 update reveals that Israel executed 'Operation Midnight Hammer'\u2014a highly synchronized strike involving twelve MOPs at Fordow, two at Natanz, and Tomahawk cruise missiles at Isfahan\u2014within minutes. The book also covers covert operations such as the 2018 theft of Iran\u2019s nuclear archive, assassinations of Iranian scientists, and sabotage of facilities. Israel\u2019s retaliatory actions included the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, pager attacks on Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon on September 17, and the destruction of Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut on September 27. Iran responded, but Israel\u2019s defenses successfully intercepted a massive barrage in April 2024, which included 30 cruise missiles, 120 ballistic missiles, and 170 drones, injuring a seven-year-old girl in Arad. The book concludes with a cautionary note from Black: 'The most important warning of this book is contained not in the text written above, but the text yet to be written below...

The Director-General of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, confirmed that on June 21, Israeli aircraft attacked a nuclear complex in the Iranian city of Isfahan for the second time since the start of the war. According to the IAEA, six buildings of the nuclear complex were damaged, including a centrifuge production plant. Grossi noted that there was no nuclear material stored at the Isfahan facility, so there will be no radioactive consequences.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 22, 2025 05:31 AM\nSource:[newsru.co.il](https://www.newsru.co.il/israel/22jun2025/d10_110.html)\n\n**US Conducts Precision Air Strike on Iranian Nuclear Facilities, Trump Warns of Stronger Counterattacks**\nThe US military conducted a precision air strike on three key nuclear facilities in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, at midnight local time on June 22. According to US President Trump, these facilities have been 'completely and thoroughly destroyed.' Trump stated, 'Our goal is to destroy Iran's uranium enrichment capability and prevent this Middle East country, which is the largest supporter of terrorism, from manufacturing nuclear weapons.' He emphasized that all US military aircraft involved in the attack have safely left Iranian airspace and declared, 'Now is the time for peace.' Trump also warned on social media platform Truth Social that if Iran retaliates against the US, it will face 'even stronger counterattacks.' The US used B-2 stealth bombers carrying heavy GBU-57 'massive bunker buster bombs' to drop several massive bombs on Fordow, while Natanz and Isfahan were attacked with approximately 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from US submarines. Iran initially denied the attack, but later confirmed that the three facilities were attacked, stating that nuclear materials had been removed beforehand to minimize losses. Iran warned that all US citizens and military personnel in the Middle East region will become 'attack targets,' and hardline parliamentarian Hamid Rasaei called for a 'strong response' to the strike. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu supported the action, calling it a 'historic declaration,' while UN Secretary-General Guterres expressed concern that it could lead to a regional conflict and urged all parties to return to diplomatic channels.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 22, 2025 04:07 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u982d\u6bbc Newtalk](https://newtalk.tw/news/view/2025-06-22/977683)\n\n**Trump Announces US Military Strike on Iranian Nuclear Facilities**\nUS President Trump announced on June 21 that the US military had successfully launched a strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. According to CBS, Trump stated on his social media platform 'Truth Social' that 'we have successfully completed the attack on Iran's three nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan.' He emphasized that all planes have left Iranian airspace and 'all ammunition has been dropped on the main target Fordow.' Trump also stated that 'now is the time to pursue peace.' Trump described the operation as 'a spectacular military success' and stated that 'Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely destroyed.' Fordow is considered a critical facility in Iran's nuclear program, located 300 feet underground with multiple air defenses. Experts believe that the most effective way to destroy the facility is to use the US-made 'Bunker Buster' GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb, which can only be launched by the US B-2 stealth bomber. A source confirmed that MOP was used in the operation, with each target hit by two bombs. However, a Pentagon official stated that three B-2 bombers participated in the attack, each carrying two MOPs. Additionally, the US military launched 30 Tomahawk missiles from a submarine, targeting Natanz and Esfahan nuclear facilities. White House officials stated that the US had notified Israel before the strike. Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu after the strike, and Netanyahu praised Trump's actions, stating 'Trump has consistently emphasized that strength leads to peace. Tonight, Trump has shown great strength with the US.' Iran had previously stated that if the US joined Israel's attack, it would retaliate. Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military targets on June 13, and Iran responded with missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities. A US intelligence official stated that 'we are in uncharted territory. We don't know how Iran will respond, as this is the most tense and intense conflict in modern times. We can't determine how the Hamani regime will respond.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 22, 2025 03:12 AM\nSource:[NOWnews \u4eca\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nownews.com/news/6698374)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across diverse expert perspectives\u2014including military strategy, intelligence analysis, diplomacy, international relations, and regional/sectarian studies\u2014there is strong consensus that the probability of any new country overtly attacking Israel or Iran (outside Israel, Iran, the US, or Palestine) between June and December 2025 is low, though not zero. All experts rely on historic base rates which demonstrate that, even at moments of severe regional escalation, new-state entry is rare: post-1973, third states have overwhelmingly preferred proxy warfare or plausible deniability rather than overt, attributable interstate attacks. The unprecedented intensity of the June 2025 Iran-Israel conflict, including direct U.S. military involvement, raises overall volatility and tail risk, but has also reinforced deterrence and risk aversion among other regional actors. Domestic political pressures, alliance dynamics, and the potential for accidental escalation or miscalculation are acknowledged as possible, but unlikely, triggers for direct entry by states such as Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, or the Gulf states. Great power patrons (U.S., Russia, China) are seen as inclined to exercise restraint over their allies and avoid further escalation. Most experts forecast a probability in the 7\u201313% range for a new country attacking Israel or Iran by the end of 2025, with one notably lower outlier at 4%. The modal reasoning is that restraint, deterrence, and past precedent outweigh the heightened risk from recent events, meaning a Yes outcome would require a significant, highly unusual breakdown in the current deterrent structure.",
