On-chain analytics show no signs of mass distribution among HODLers or ETF withdrawal waves, and core support clusters remain unchallenged. However, the recent high leverage means volatility remains elevated, and a sudden macro or liquidity shock could drag prices lower in the short term. Still, with only ~25% downside buffer to flip to 'No' and over three months for corrective forces to abate (or a Q4 rally to resume), statistical and on-chain evidence jointly support a strong probability (>80%) that Bitcoin ends 2025 above its starting value.

Current price action shows a healthy correction after a euphoric rally, with clear evidence of over-leveraged positions being flushed. However, structural tailwinds are intact: regulatory clarity, novel investor access (401(k)s, ETFs), and continued US institutional acceptance provide support. The drop from $124K to ~$112K is significant but does not erase the YTD gain, and a further ~17% sustained drop in the next 100 days would likely require the emergence of a sustained macro shock or a dramatic sentiment reversal. While not impossible\u2014especially if global risk appetite sours\u2014the base rate and sentiment data favor a 'Yes'.

Massive inflows to ETFs and corporate treasuries have institutionalized demand. History shows that when BTC is substantially up by September, it rarely closes the year below its open, absent true systemic collapse. The main risk is a dramatic deleveraging event, macro shock, or unexpected regulatory backlash\u2014but this would require a sharper fall than is statistically normal in this context (about a 17% decline from here).

(2) New inflows via U.S. ETFs and treasuries reinforce buy-side pressure, and institutional presence is known to dampen, not amplify, downside volatility in late-cycle bull markets. (3) Macro tailwinds (rate cuts, abundant liquidity) make aggressive risk-off moves less probable. (4) The recent correction appears to be an unwinding of leverage after overextension, not the beginning of a lasting bear market; historical base rates indicate post-correction years with strong macro/policy alignment almost always close green. (5) Only the emergence of a severe new exogenous shock or a dramatic negative narrative shift would threaten a full roundtrip to sub-$93K levels by December 31, and none are currently visible.

I see a substantial cushion for 'Yes,' and even with this week's crash, the distributed architecture of actors/investors/uses gives the system a way to absorb shocks without full meltdown.

Defenses from asset pricing and technical perspectives also highlight that the September correction appears to be a healthy flush rather than a signal for an imminent, sustained bear market. The one area that could justify a minor upward revision is the added assurance from on-chain accumulation data and low exchange balances, but this is balanced by appreciation of persistent volatility.

Particularly persuasive was the defense of East Asian and global adoption trends as distributed-system analogs for network redundancy, and the point that even market structure shocks (liquidations) are being absorbed by institutional flows as visible on-chain.

This move signals a shift from a niche strategy to a broader trend among listed companies. The article cites Bloomberg 2024 data showing a 0.82 correlation between MicroStrategy\u2019s share price and Bitcoin, far exceeding the impact of its core business, and a 2021 Morgan Stanley report that Bitcoin holdings could lift a company\u2019s target price by about 8\u202f%. It also notes that during the 2022 Bitcoin crash of 65\u202f%, MicroStrategy\u2019s shares fell 71\u202f%, outpacing the Nasdaq. A JPMorgan 2023 study found that firms with crypto holdings above 20\u202f% of net assets had a 42\u202f% higher stock\u2011price volatility than the industry average (based on 37 listed firms). To hedge, Meitu (ticker 1357) reduced its Bitcoin\u2011market beta from 1.2 to 0.9 by buying CME Bitcoin futures. Regulatory uncertainty is highlighted by the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase that wiped $3.1\u202fbillion from its market cap in a single day, and by Trump Media\u2019s announcement that mentioned the phrase '\u6ce2\u52d5\u6027\u98a8\u96aa' 17 times. The piece discusses implications for Hong Kong, noting that HKFRS has no clear crypto\u2011asset accounting rules and that investors should scrutinise a company\u2019s on\u2011chain transparency and risk\u2011management capability when evaluating DAT strategies. The article concludes that while DAT can create sustained market premiums when paired with clear funding strategies and strict risk controls, investors must assess whether a firm\u2019s intent is long\u2011term value storage or short\u2011term speculation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[\u5373\u6642\u65b0\u805e instant news](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%e7%b6%93%e6%bf%9f/article/20250923/s00004/1758561103528/%e9%99%b3%e9%a0%b4%e5%b3%af%e5%8d%9a%e5%a3%ab-dat-%e6%95%b8%e5%ad%97%e8%b3%87%e7%94%a2%e8%b2%a1%e5%ba%ab-%e4%b8%8a%e5%b8%82%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e8%b2%a1%e5%ba%ab%e7%ae%a1%e7%90%86%e6%96%b0%e6%b5%aa%e6%bd%ae)\n\n**Crypto Crash: $1.5\u202fBillion in Wagers Liquidated \u2013 Bitcoin on the Decline**\nBitcoin fell below $112,000, dropping 2.9% on Monday, while Ether lost about 9% to $4,075. According to the analysis firm Coinglass, more than 407,000 traders had to liquidate positions, wiping out roughly $1.5\u202fbillion of bets, as reported by the British newspaper 'The Telegraph'. The crash pushed the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies below $4\u202ftrillion, according to 'CoinGecko'. The downturn follows a period in which former U.S. President Donald Trump, who had previously called cryptocurrencies a 'Scam', has shifted his stance, launching memecoins with his wife Melania and securing a $1\u202fbillion deal between Trump Media & Technology Group and the exchange 'crypto.com'. The U.S. government has also adopted several crypto\u2011friendly measures\u2014building a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dropping lawsuits against crypto firms, enacting laws that allow banks to issue stablecoins, and permitting pension funds to invest in cryptocurrencies\u2014which helped lift Bitcoin to a record high of $120,000 in August, double the previous year\u2019s peak. Despite the market pullback, the Trump family reportedly stands to gain from their crypto investments, with two holdings valued at $6.5\u202fbillion, surpassing the earnings from their traditional real\u2011estate business, according to 'The Telegraph'.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:49 PM\nSource:[Focus](https://www.focus.de/finanzen/krypto-crash-1-5-milliarden-dollar-an-wetten-liquidiert-bitcoin-auf-talfahrt_04dafd1b-a1d7-4937-b53e-1b1b220bd01b.html)\n\n**Crypto suffers \u00a31bn slump as 'Trump bump' fades**\nTraders lost $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) of cryptocurrency bets when prices fell, according to Coinglass data. The slump hit 407,000 traders who had leveraged positions, triggering margin calls. Bitcoin fell 2.9% to below $112,000, while Ether dropped 9% to $4,075. The total market cap fell below $4tn, per CoinGecko. Coinbase shares slid 2.7% in pre\u2011market trading. The decline followed a rally that had been fueled by Donald Trump\u2019s pro\u2011crypto stance. Mr Trump once called cryptocurrencies a \"scam\", but has adopted a far more crypto\u2011friendly tone in his second term, launching his own \"memecoins\" and signing a multibillion\u2011dollar deal with Crypto.com. The administration has also enacted pro\u2011crypto policies, such as a strategic Bitcoin reserve and dropping lawsuits against crypto firms. Congress has passed laws allowing banks to issue stablecoins, and Trump has said pension funds should be able to invest in crypto. Bitcoin reached $120,000 in August, its highest level since the 2020 election. Edouard Hindi, chief investment officer at Tyr Capital, said the market is \"unwinding\" after overvaluation. He noted that 'you could just feel that there was something growing\u2026 the market froze, liquidity dropped and a couple of investors liquidated their positions overnight.' He added, 'It didn't make sense. That premia was a bit too high and the whole thing has started to unwind in the last 10 days.' The Trump family has made billions from a series of crypto ventures, with two of the family's crypto investments valued at a combined $6.5bn earlier this month.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Between July\u202f2024 and June\u202f2025, the region processed $2.3\u202ftrillion in received transaction value, peaking at $244\u202fbillion in December\u202f2024, driven by institutional inflows and post\u2011election bullish sentiment. Stablecoin usage also reached a record high in December\u202f2024, signalling a shift from speculative trading to regulated investment vehicles.\n\nU.S. regulators have moved from uncertainty to streamlined frameworks. The SEC, OCC, and CFTC have updated guidance, and in July\u202f2025 President Trump\u2019s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released recommendations to crown the U.S. as the \u2018crypto capital of the world.\u2019 The GENIUS Act, signed that month, created a two\u2011tier system for stablecoins: federal oversight for issuers with market caps above $10\u202fbillion and state oversight for smaller issuers.\n\nTokenized U.S. Treasuries and spot bitcoin ETFs are highlighted as key drivers. Tokenized money\u2011market funds grew from $2\u202fbillion AUM in August\u202f2024 to over $7\u202fbillion by August\u202f2025. Global bitcoin ETF AUM reached $179.5\u202fbillion by mid\u2011July\u202f2025, with U.S.\u2011listed funds holding more than $120\u202fbillion. Ethereum ETFs amassed $24\u202fbillion shortly after launch.\n\nStablecoins dominate the ecosystem, with monthly transfer volumes in 2025 routinely exceeding $2\u202ftrillion and peaking near $3\u202ftrillion. From January to July 2025, adjusted transaction value approached $16\u202ftrillion, nearly triple the previous year\u2019s figures.

The task force, led by officials from the US Treasury and the UK Treasury and including regulators from both countries, aims to coordinate rules while each nation is still drafting its own legislation and to facilitate cross\u2011border capital raising for crypto companies. The US Treasury Department stated, 'These recommendations are to be developed in close collaboration with industry partners ensuring we unlock opportunities for investors, businesses, and market participants on both sides of the Atlantic.' Major financial and crypto firms\u2014Bank of America, Barclays, Circle, Citi, Coinbase, and Ripple\u2014sent representatives to early meetings. Dante Disparte of Circle called the task force a 'pivotal step forward' and said it would help create 'safer, more resilient markets.' Coinbase highlighted the need for a 'stablecoin corridor' between the two countries. The announcement follows the Trump administration\u2019s pro\u2011crypto stance and the UK\u2019s April 2025 draft legislation that will bring crypto firms under the same regulatory framework as traditional financial firms, with full rules expected in 2026. The task force faces challenges such as stablecoin regulation and balancing innovation with consumer protection. Market reactions included a 3.5% drop in Coinbase shares and Bitcoin trading at about $112,700, down 2.4% in 24 hours. The partnership is seen as a potential global benchmark for crypto regulation, with the US and UK hoping to outpace other financial centers like Singapore and Hong Kong.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 11:10 PM\nSource:[Brave New Coin](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/us-and-uk-create-joint-crypto-task-force-to-shape-future-regulations)\n\n**Dr. Chen Ying\u2011feng: DAT Digital Asset Treasury \u2013 A New Wave for Listed Companies**\nThe article reports that in August 2024, former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Trump Media & Technology Group announced a strategic partnership with the top\u201110 cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com, using $105\u202fmillion of company funds to buy CRO tokens and create a corporate digital\u2011asset treasury (DAT). This move signals a shift from a niche strategy to a broader trend among listed companies. The article cites Bloomberg 2024 data showing a 0.82 correlation between MicroStrategy\u2019s share price and Bitcoin, far exceeding the impact of its core business, and a 2021 Morgan Stanley report that Bitcoin holdings could lift a company\u2019s target price by about 8\u202f%. It also notes that during the 2022 Bitcoin crash of 65\u202f%, MicroStrategy\u2019s shares fell 71\u202f%, outpacing the Nasdaq. A JPMorgan 2023 study found that firms with crypto holdings above 20\u202f% of net assets had a 42\u202f% higher stock\u2011price volatility than the industry average (based on 37 listed firms). To hedge, Meitu (ticker 1357) reduced its Bitcoin\u2011market beta from 1.2 to 0.9 by buying CME Bitcoin futures. Regulatory uncertainty is highlighted by the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase that wiped $3.1\u202fbillion from its market cap in a single day, and by Trump Media\u2019s announcement that mentioned the phrase '\u6ce2\u52d5\u6027\u98a8\u96aa' 17 times. The piece discusses implications for Hong Kong, noting that HKFRS has no clear crypto\u2011asset accounting rules and that investors should scrutinise a company\u2019s on\u2011chain transparency and risk\u2011management capability when evaluating DAT strategies. The article concludes that while DAT can create sustained market premiums when paired with clear funding strategies and strict risk controls, investors must assess whether a firm\u2019s intent is long\u2011term value storage or short\u2011term speculation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[\u5373\u6642\u65b0\u805e instant news](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%e7%b6%93%e6%bf%9f/article/20250923/s00004/1758561103528/%e9%99%b3%e9%a0%b4%e5%b3%af%e5%8d%9a%e5%a3%ab-dat-%e6%95%b8%e5%ad%97%e8%b3%87%e7%94%a2%e8%b2%a1%e5%ba%ab-%e4%b8%8a%e5%b8%82%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e8%b2%a1%e5%ba%ab%e7%ae%a1%e7%90%86%e6%96%b0%e6%b5%aa%e6%bd%ae)\n\n**US\u2011UK Transatlantic Working Group to Explore Crypto Regulation Collaboration**\nOn September 22 2025, the U.S. Treasury and the UK Treasury announced the creation of a Transatlantic Working Group on Future Markets to examine cryptocurrency laws and regulations. The group, which will operate through the existing UK\u2011US Financial Regulation Working Group, is expected to publish a report with recommendations within 180 days. It will study how the two countries can collaborate on wholesale digital\u2011market innovation and will seek input from leading industry experts, as the Treasury said it would \"recabar la opini\u00f3n de los principales expertos del sector\". The announcement followed a Financial Times report of a meeting between UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Representatives from several crypto firms participated in the discussion. The U.S. Treasury did not say whether the group relates to pending U.S. legislation such as the Payment Stablecoin Framework Act (GENIUS). Coinbase\u2019s vice\u2011president Daniel Seifert said the company was \"orgullosa\" of supporting the collaboration. Both governments have taken steps to address regulatory issues for digital assets in 2025, including a memorandum of understanding signed by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and former U.S. President Donald Trump to explore technology development, though the agreement is not legally binding. The U.S. Treasury has also indicated it will explore \"neutral budgetary paths\" for acquiring Bitcoin as part of its crypto reserve plans.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 07:45 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/us-uk-digital-asset-task-force-regulation)\n\n**Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP In Freefall: What's Driving The Current Crypto Slump?**\nThe cryptocurrency market began the week with a notable downturn, as total sector capitalization dipped toward $3.8\u202ftrillion. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant correction, trading as low as $112,700. CoinGecko data shows that this decline had a ripple effect, causing major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) to register losses of 7\u202f%, 5\u202f%, 7\u202f%, and 10\u202f%, respectively. The sell\u2011off also impacted crypto\u2011related stocks: Bitcoin investment firm Strategy (MSTR) fell 2.6\u202f%, while US\u2011based crypto asset exchange Coinbase dropped 3.4\u202f% during afternoon trading. In contrast, the benchmark S&P\u202f500 index gained 0.4\u202f%, positioning itself for another potential all\u2011time high. Analysts suggest that the recent market slump can be attributed to a buildup of excess leverage following last Thursday\u2019s Federal Reserve (Fed) decision to cut interest rates. Adam Morgan McCarthy, head of research at Kaiko, indicated that funding rates have risen since the Fed meeting, pointing to speculative trading that may have occurred in the wake of the rate cut. He noted that the combination of excess leverage from speculative bets and an earlier price decline triggered a wave of liquidations, further exacerbating the market downturn. The Fed\u2019s decision to lower borrowing costs by a quarter point marked its first rate cut of 2025. However, as Barron\u2019s reported on Monday, Chair Jerome Powell characterized this move as a 'risk-management cut,' implying a cautious approach rather than a wholesale easing of monetary policy. Despite the immediate challenges facing the cryptocurrency market, the longer\u2011term outlook appears optimistic. Deutsche Bank strategist Marion Laboure expressed confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, predicting it could surpass $120,000 by the end of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource:[NewsBTC](https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-in-freefall-whats-driving-the-current-crypto-slump/)\n\n**Binance-linked cryptocurrency hits record: What is driving the surge? | Stock Market News**\nOn September\u202f22\u202f2025, Bloomberg data showed the BNB token, the fifth\u2011largest cryptocurrency by market value, surged to an all\u2011time high of $1,083 on Sunday. The price later retraced alongside Bitcoin and Ether during a broader market sell\u2011off. The rally has been attributed to speculation that Binance co\u2011founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) may receive a U.S. presidential pardon, a claim he reiterated on a May podcast. He publicly stated on a podcast in May that he was seeking a pardon from US President Donald Trump. Online betting platform Polymarket set a 64\u202f% probability of a pardon on September\u202f13, later dropping to 50\u202f%. Patrick Horsman, co\u2011founder of Build and Build Corp, told Bloomberg that 'Rumors of CZ's (Changpeng Zhao) possible pardon fuel further speculation,' he said. Regulatory pressure is also a factor: Senator Elizabeth Warren has asked the U.S. Justice Department to confirm Binance\u2019s compliance with its 2023 settlement over money\u2011laundering and sanctions violations, and Binance may soon negotiate a deal to remove an external compliance monitor. CoinMarketCap data indicate that listed accumulators hold about $560\u202fmillion of BNB, representing 0.4\u202f% of the total supply.

According to the analysis firm Coinglass, more than 407,000 traders had to liquidate positions, wiping out roughly $1.5\u202fbillion of bets, as reported by the British newspaper 'The Telegraph'. The crash pushed the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies below $4\u202ftrillion, according to 'CoinGecko'. The downturn follows a period in which former U.S. President Donald Trump, who had previously called cryptocurrencies a 'Scam', has shifted his stance, launching memecoins with his wife Melania and securing a $1\u202fbillion deal between Trump Media & Technology Group and the exchange 'crypto.com'. The U.S. government has also adopted several crypto\u2011friendly measures\u2014building a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dropping lawsuits against crypto firms, enacting laws that allow banks to issue stablecoins, and permitting pension funds to invest in cryptocurrencies\u2014which helped lift Bitcoin to a record high of $120,000 in August, double the previous year\u2019s peak.

The total market cap fell below $4tn, per CoinGecko. Coinbase shares slid 2.7% in pre\u2011market trading. The decline followed a rally that had been fueled by Donald Trump\u2019s pro\u2011crypto stance. Mr Trump once called cryptocurrencies a \"scam\", but has adopted a far more crypto\u2011friendly tone in his second term, launching his own \"memecoins\" and signing a multibillion\u2011dollar deal with Crypto.com. The administration has also enacted pro\u2011crypto policies, such as a strategic Bitcoin reserve and dropping lawsuits against crypto firms. Congress has passed laws allowing banks to issue stablecoins, and Trump has said pension funds should be able to invest in crypto. Bitcoin reached $120,000 in August, its highest level since the 2020 election. Edouard Hindi, chief investment officer at Tyr Capital, said the market is \"unwinding\" after overvaluation. He noted that 'you could just feel that there was something growing\u2026 the market froze, liquidity dropped and a couple of investors liquidated their positions overnight.' He added, 'It didn't make sense. That premia was a bit too high and the whole thing has started to unwind in the last 10 days.'

Between July\u202f2024 and June\u202f2025, the region processed $2.3\u202ftrillion in received transaction value, peaking at $244\u202fbillion in December\u202f2024, driven by institutional inflows and post\u2011election bullish sentiment. Stablecoin usage also reached a record high in December\u202f2024, signalling a shift from speculative trading to regulated investment vehicles.\n\nU.S. regulators have moved from uncertainty to streamlined frameworks. The SEC, OCC, and CFTC have updated guidance, and in July\u202f2025 President Trump\u2019s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released recommendations to crown the U.S. as the \u2018crypto capital of the world.\u2019 The GENIUS Act, signed that month, created a two\u2011tier system for stablecoins: federal oversight for issuers with market caps above $10\u202fbillion and state oversight for smaller issuers.\n\nTokenized U.S. Treasuries and spot bitcoin ETFs are highlighted as key drivers. Tokenized money\u2011market funds grew from $2\u202fbillion AUM in August\u202f2024 to over $7\u202fbillion by August\u202f2025. Global bitcoin ETF AUM reached $179.5\u202fbillion by mid\u2011July\u202f2025, with U.S.\u2011listed funds holding more than $120\u202fbillion. Ethereum ETFs amassed $24\u202fbillion shortly after launch.\n\nStablecoins dominate the ecosystem, with monthly transfer volumes in 2025 routinely exceeding $2\u202ftrillion and peaking near $3\u202ftrillion. From January to July 2025, adjusted transaction value approached $16\u202ftrillion, nearly triple the previous year\u2019s figures.

Coinbase CEO Armstrong Names Trigger - Business Insider**\nThe article reports that the cryptocurrency market has been largely sideways over the weekend, with Bitcoin trading around $115,000 and Ethereum near $4,500. 2025 has seen a positive trend, as Bitcoin has gained roughly 25\u202f% year\u2011to\u2011date, largely driven by regulatory changes in the United States.  Under the Trump administration a more crypto\u2011friendly environment was created, and the current focus is on the proposed \"Clarity Act\" (also known as the Market Structure Bill).  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the Act could be the \"next decisive step\" for U.S. regulation, providing legal certainty for companies, investors and projects and potentially becoming \"the biggest catalyst\" for the sector.  The bill, H.R. 3633, would split oversight between the SEC and CFTC, require exchanges and brokers to register, set transparency and disclosure obligations, and regulate stablecoins while excluding certain DeFi activities and banning a Fed\u2011issued CBDC.  It was passed by the House in July 2025 and is now in the Senate Banking Committee.  Analyst Daniel Olshansky views the Act as a technical improvement in jurisdictional clarity but notes token classification remains complex, with assets split into speculative ROI tokens, utility tokens (including stablecoins and infrastructure) and security tokens focused on governance or privacy.  He expects courts to decide on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis, so full clarity may not arrive immediately.  The article also highlights the importance of speed in the volatile crypto sector, citing Snorter's Telegram\u2011based bot that processes blockchain data in real time to execute trades instantly, giving traders an edge in markets where seconds matter.  Snorter's SNORT token, used to access the bot, offers lower fees, voting rights and staking rewards; the presale raised over $4\u202fmillion, signalling strong demand for automated trading solutions.  The project operates on Solana for low fees and high speed, with plans to expand to other blockchains.

Ethereum has also surged to $4.7K, its highest level since late 2021. The rise in Bitcoin is driven by a favorable legislative environment created by President Donald Trump, which has increased demand and potential for further gains. The coordinated action highlights that mainstream benchmarks and speculative market corners are using the same source of optimism. According to CoinGecko, both tokens now account for roughly 70% of all cryptocurrency market valuation. The steady demand from recently active treasury firms has driven Ether's rise, while Bitcoin's more gradual ascent has relied on ongoing exchange-traded inflows despite technical resistance. As anticipated, this week's US inflation data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in September, improving financial conditions and attracting capital from blue-chip stocks to volatile digital tokens.

This growth is largely attributed to the adoption of the first national law on stablecoins in the US, initiated by the administration of former President Donald Trump. The law regulates digital assets tied to the US dollar and provides for state oversight, ensuring transparency and security for institutional investors. This has significantly increased the trust of major players in the cryptocurrency market. As Bloomberg reports, citing CoinGecko data, the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has exceeded $4 trillion for the first time in history. The law establishes clear rules for stablecoin issuers, including reserve requirements and liability, and opens the door for traditional financial institutions to participate in the cryptocurrency sector. The cryptocurrency community has welcomed the law, as it reduces regulatory uncertainty and encourages institutional capital to enter the cryptocurrency space. Analysts predict that if the US maintains a favorable policy and a stable regulatory environment, the market capitalization may reach $5 trillion by the end of 2025. 'The path for Bitcoin to reach $150,000 looks increasingly inevitable,' said an analyst. In the wake of the growth in Bitcoin's value, the altcoin segment has also become more active. For example, Ether has risen by 22% over the past five days, Uniswap has increased by 24%, and Solana has added 6.5%.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: July 30, 2025 07:10 AM\nSource:[pozitciya.com.ua](https://pozitciya.com.ua/111315-kriptorinok-perevischiv-4-trln-zavdyaki-zakonu-trampa-pro-steyblkoyini.html)\n\n**Crypto Policy Under the Trump Administration Could Enhance Adoption of Digital Assets : Analysis**\nThe Trump Administration has ushered in a transformative period for cryptocurrency policy in the United States, aiming to position the nation as the global 'crypto capital.' President Trump signed two pivotal executive orders, including the 'Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology' order, which promotes self-custody, blockchain access, mining, and uncensored transactions while prohibiting the development of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The order also established the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, chaired by David Sacks, to deliver a federal regulatory framework within 180 days. The Treasury Department created a 'Strategic Crypto Reserve,' including assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano, positioning cryptocurrencies alongside traditional reserves like gold. The SEC has launched 'Crypto 2.0,' a task force to develop clear regulatory boundaries and sensible disclosure frameworks, and has rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, allowing banks to custody client crypto assets. The GENIUS Act, signed by President Trump on July 18, 2025, regulates stablecoins, sets clear rules for banks and issuers, and marks a historic recognition of crypto in U.S. law.

Analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. As institutional investors increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies as a safe-haven asset or long-term speculation, more listed companies are allocating a portion of their reserve capital to Bitcoin, solidifying the sector's reputation as a 'safe-haven'. The stock market is also reflecting this trend, with stocks like Coinbase and Robinhood reaching record highs due to the cryptocurrency rally.

Ether, the second-biggest crypto token, has more than doubled over the past three months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 20, 2025 07:44 PM\nSource:[The Daily Star](https://www.thedailystar.net/business/global-economy/news/crypto-sector-breaches-4tn-market-value-3944256)\n\n**Cryptocurrency Market Surpasses $4 Trillion as US Regulatory Advancements Drive Price Surge**\nThe cryptocurrency market has surpassed $4 trillion in total market capitalization, driven by the surge in XRP and Ethereum (ETH) prices. According to CoinGecko, this is the first time the market has reached this level, reflecting a rotation of capital from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins. The price increase, the largest since November 2021, is directly linked to the regulatory advancements in the United States, a shift in the era of Biden. The Congress has approved two widely anticipated laws: the GENIUS Act, focused on stablecoins, and the CLARITY Act, which sets guidelines for the cryptocurrency market in general. Both measures received bipartisan support and are now awaiting signature from President Donald Trump. Additionally, a report by the Financial Times revealed that Trump may sign an executive order in the coming days authorizing investment in cryptocurrencies through 401(k) retirement accounts. This news led Bitcoin to surpass $120,000, while XRP broke its 2018 historical maximum and reached $3.50, with a 14% increase in the day and over $200 billion in market value. 'The approval of the GENIUS Act represents a historic turning point,' said Rep. French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. According to him, the project 'establishes clear rules for stablecoin payments.' Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, described the advancement as 'an important milestone for US leadership in payment innovation, with a focus on consumer safety.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 18, 2025 10:40 AM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mercados/xrp-e-ethereum-disparam-e-mercado-cripto-vai-a-us-4-tri-apos-eua-aprovarem-regulacao/)\n\n**Bitcoin Surpasses $123,000 for the First Time in History**\nBitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $123,091 for the first time in its history, according to CoinMarketCap. This comes as investors expect a long-awaited political gain for this type of asset this week. The US House of Representatives will discuss a series of laws to provide a regulatory framework for the digital assets industry later today, a long-awaited demand. The progress made in cryptocurrency legislation has added momentum to the rally, with the House of Representatives discussing and possibly voting on the 'Clarity' law, the central bank digital currency monitoring law, and the 'Genius' package of stablecoins introduced by the Senate, while Republicans are moving to support President Donald Trump's agenda in favor of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has risen by 29% since the beginning of the year, leading to a broader recovery in other cryptocurrencies in recent weeks despite the tariffs imposed by Trump and the chaos they caused. George Mandris, a major trader at eXBT Trading, said, 'This shift indicates a mature perspective on Bitcoin; it's not just a speculative asset, but a complete hedging tool and a rare value store.' Investors have injected more than $2.7 billion into US-traded Bitcoin funds last week, marking the fifth-largest weekly inflow since its debut in January last year. The 12 funds now manage a combined $151 billion in assets, and the open interest in Bitcoin futures has reached a record high of $86.3 billion, according to data from CoinGlass. In terms of decentralized trading, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has risen to its highest level in over 5 months at $3,062, and 'XRP' has risen by about 3%.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 14, 2025 08:09 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2025/7/14/bitcoin-first-history-price)\n\n**Bitcoin Surpasses $118,000 for the First Time in History**\nBitcoin has surpassed $118,000 for the first time in its history, according to data from the cryptocurrency exchange platform 'CoinGecko'. The price of Bitcoin rose from around $113,000 on Thursday evening to $118,000 at 9:03 am on Friday, before falling back to $117,262. This is the highest level in the history of the cryptocurrency, surpassing the previous record of $111,000 set in May. According to Anadolu Ajans\u0131's correspondent, this significant increase in price is driven by unprecedented inflows into Bitcoin futures traded on the US stock exchange, as well as a range of political and economic factors. These factors include the ongoing decline in the value of the dollar and legislative efforts in the US Congress to regulate the cryptocurrency market, particularly stablecoins, which are often pegged to the dollar or euro to ensure their stability. Additionally, the positive stance on cryptocurrencies by the administration of US President Donald Trump has added momentum to this increase, amidst growing political support for this sector. In this context, the US Senate recently approved a bill known as the 'Geneva Act', aimed at establishing a regulatory framework to protect users of stablecoins. The bill is expected to be presented to the US House of Representatives next week, seen by observers as a step towards wider official recognition of digital assets in the US. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency futures market has seen unprecedented liquidations, with over $1.11 billion in short positions being closed in just 24 hours, according to data from 'Quandl'. This is the largest liquidation since the beginning of the year, exceeding the previous record set on May 10, reflecting the volatility of the market and the impact of Bitcoin's sudden surge on traders who had bet on its decline.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 05:38 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B2-118-%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87/3628516)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts unanimously forecast a high probability\u2014specifically, 83%\u2014that Bitcoin will close 2025 above its starting price of $93,429.20. Their analyses draw from diverse perspectives (on-chain analytics, sentiment, international regulation, regional adoption, behavioral and monetary economics, asset pricing, technical analysis, cryptography, and distributed systems), yet reach strikingly similar conclusions.\n\nKey supporting factors across forecasts include:\n- Strong US regulatory tailwinds: The Trump administration\u2019s pro-crypto stance, with landmark legislation (GENIUS Act), ETF approvals, and enhanced regulatory clarity, has drawn institutional capital and reduced existential downside risk.\n- Heavy and persistent institutional inflows: Spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate/sovereign treasuries underpin significant and relatively stable demand, lowering the likelihood of deep or sustained drawdowns below the threshold.\n- Macro conditions: Recent US Federal Reserve rate cuts and generally supportive risk-on environments favor continued demand for high-beta assets like Bitcoin.\n- Historical base rates: In years where Bitcoin is substantially up by late-September and significant regulatory/institutional infrastructure is in place, the asset has rarely ended the year below its starting level, barring severe macro or regulatory shocks.\n\nPotential risks moderating a higher probability include:\n- Recent sharp correction and deleveraging: The drop from $124,000 to ~$112,000, liquidating $1.5B in positions, reveals ongoing volatility and the market\u2019s susceptibility to downside if deleveraging accelerates or new macro shocks emerge.\n- Outlier tail risks: Scenarios such as coordinated regulatory crackdowns, catastrophic technical failures or hacks, or a sudden global risk-off event could, in theory, push Bitcoin below $93k by year-end, but these are seen as unlikely given current trends and buffers.\n\nConsensus scenarios are:\n- A 'Yes' outcome is seen as most probable: Bitcoin stabilizes or rebounds on the back of structural flows, resilient long-term holders, and institutional participation, keeping it well above the opening threshold even if volatility persists.\n- A 'No' outcome would likely require a severe and sustained confluence of adverse events or a black swan shock, for which there is currently scant evidence.\n\nIn summary, despite acknowledging near-term risks from recent pullbacks and market fragility, the structural, regulatory, and historical context overwhelmingly favor a 'Yes' resolution. The collective probability is consistently set at 83% by all experts, reflecting considerable confidence but not complete certainty.",
