The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn February 26, 2025, the FDA unexpectedly canceled its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting that was scheduled for March 2025. This meeting is typically held annually to select the influenza virus strains to be included in the upcoming season's flu vaccines for the United States.\n\nThe FDA has maintained an uninterrupted annual approval process for seasonal influenza vaccines since 1973. Each year, the FDA follows a consistent timeline for approving updated flu vaccine formulations based on recommendations about which influenza strains are likely to circulate during the upcoming flu season. The strain selection process typically occurs in spring to give vaccine manufacturers sufficient time to produce shots for fall distribution.\n\nThe cancellation coincides with other significant changes in U.S. public health policy:\n\n* In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization (WHO)\n* Federal health officials were subsequently ordered to stop communicating with the WHO\n* A CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was also recently postponed\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":35582,\"question_id\":35030}}`",

The change will reduce mandatory vaccines to varicella, hepatitis\u202fB, influenza\u202fHib, and pneumococcal diseases, while keeping polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus. The decision places responsibility on parents, as stated by state health secretary Joseph\u202fLadapo: 'Si quieren, Dios los bendiga, pueden poner todas las que deseen. Y si no, los padres deben tener la capacidad y el poder de decidir qu\u00e9 entra en el cuerpo de sus hijos. Es as\u00ed de simple'. The move follows a rise in vaccine\u2011preventable diseases: measles has reached its worst U.S. outbreak in over 30\u202fyears with more than 1,400 confirmed cases and three deaths, mainly in Texas; pertussis has caused the deaths of at least two babies in Louisiana and a five\u2011year\u2011old in Washington, with more than 19,000 reported cases as of August\u202f23, up nearly 2,000 from the same date last year, according to CDC preliminary data. The World Health Organization reports that vaccines have saved at least 154\u202fmillion lives worldwide in the past 50\u202fyears. Florida currently allows religious exemptions. The state legislature will not reconvene until January\u202f2026, with committees meeting in October, meaning the current vaccination schedule will remain in force for the rest of the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 10:19 PM\nSource:[CiberCuba](https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-09-15-u1-e135253-s27061-nid310966-cambio-norma-vacunas-escolares-florida-entrara-vigor)\n\n**Despite Policy Confusion, Vaccines for Flu, COVID Still Strongly Recommended**\nMichigan Medicine experts explain that flu, RSV, and COVID vaccines remain essential for preventing severe disease and death. Pamela Rockwell, D.O., notes that immunization rates are falling, citing a recent measles outbreak and that 14 Michigan children died of the flu last year, most unvaccinated. Adam Lauring, M.D., Ph.D., confirms that the science of vaccine benefit hasn't changed. He states the 2025\u20112026 flu vaccine is updated and should be available soon; for most people it can be taken anytime, but if not high\u2011risk, October is acceptable. Lauring also describes FluMist, an inhaled live\u2011attenuated vaccine approved for home use in ages 2\u201149, noting it can cause mild sniffles but does not give flu. RSV vaccine recommendations target people over 75, those 50\u201174 with chronic conditions, and pregnant women between 32\u201136 weeks; a monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab, protects infants \u22648\u202fmonths. CDC data for the 2024\u20112025 RSV season show 190,000\u2011350,000 hospitalizations and 10,000\u201123,000 deaths. Regarding COVID, Rockwell says the recommendation that people 6\u202fmonths and older are eligible remains, but policy changes may limit access: the FDA ended emergency use for Pfizer in kids under 5, leaving Moderna as the only option; the FDA now recommends COVID vaccines only for those 65+ or at high risk, listing conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, cancer, obesity, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes, depression, disabilities, physical inactivity, pregnancy, etc. She warns that insurance coverage could be jeopardized and that many patients declined the vaccine when offered.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[The Good Men Project](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/despite-policy-confusion-vaccines-for-flu-covid-still-strongly-recommended/)\n\n**How RFK Jr. just made getting vaccinated a matter of what state you live in**\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, has reversed many vaccine policies, sparking a split across states. In June, he dismissed all 17 members of the CDC\u2019s independent advisory panel on immunization and replaced them with vaccine skeptics, claiming the move was to 're\u2011establish public confidence in vaccine science.' He also cancelled $500\u202fmillion in federal funding for mRNA vaccine research and removed former CDC director Susan Monarez in late August. The FDA narrowed approval of updated COVID\u201119 shots for people under 65 to those with at least one underlying condition, excluding otherwise eligible individuals.\n\nStates have responded in divergent ways. The West Coast Health Alliance\u2014Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii\u2014announced it would issue its own vaccine guidance to counter the CDC\u2019s \"destruction.\" Florida, led by Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Governor Ron\u202fDeSantis, became the first state to abolish school vaccine mandates, with Ladapo declaring that 'every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery.' In contrast, New\u202fMexico, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Colorado allowed pharmacies to administer COVID\u201119 vaccines without prescriptions. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey ordered insurers to cover all state\u2011recommended immunizations; New\u202fYork Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order protecting near\u2011universal access to COVID\u201119 vaccines until October\u202f5; Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and New Jersey Dept. of Health expanded pharmacy access; Virginia Health Commissioner Karen Shelton cleared pharmacy administration for adults 65+ and certain 18\u201164 medical conditions. Illinois remains undecided, expecting guidance by end of September. Former CDC chief of staff Kyle McGowan warned that without federal leadership, states would pursue \"50 states doing 50 different things.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 01:03 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/covid-vaccine-2025-trump-rfk-where-b2820238.html)\n\n**Butantan\u2019s Race to Produce 80\u202fMillion Flu Vaccine Doses Before Next Winter**\nThe article explains how the Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o\u202fPaulo is operating a \"war\u2011like\" effort to produce 80\u202fmillion doses of the seasonal influenza vaccine before the upcoming winter.

One doctor recounted spending 30\u202fminutes returning calls from anxious patients and said, 'Had I reviewed their histories and written vaccine prescriptions it would have taken all day. I would have had to reschedule 18 future appointments to make up that lost day.' The article blames Health and Human Secretary Robert Kennedy for an anti\u2011vaccination stance, noting that he fired the Advisory Panel on Immunization Practices, the body that approves immunization recommendations. Without that panel\u2019s approval, most states will not allow COVID shots without a written prescription. It cites a September\u202f17\u201118 panel meeting that will now be staffed by Kennedy\u2019s appointees, raising concerns about decision\u2011making.\n\nThe piece also highlights federal budget cuts: CDC funding has been cut by nearly half, leading to eroded confidence among health professionals; the National Institutes of Health has lost more than $2\u202fbillion in grants and 1,300 jobs, causing research and clinical trials to be canceled. It warns that a projected $1\u202fbillion cut to Medicaid from Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d will take effect in October\u202f2026, and that North Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services has recommended a $819\u202fmillion Medicaid increase for the current budget year, but only $500\u202fmillion was authorized. This shortfall forces a minimum 3\u202f% reduction in payments to Medicaid providers and a 10\u202f% cut for inpatient, residential, behavioral therapy and autism services.\n\nThe article predicts that over 600,000 Medicaid\u2011expanded enrollees could lose benefits, pushing more patients to emergency departments. It also raises the possibility that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) could be revised or repealed under the financial strain on hospitals, potentially leading to the closure of rural hospitals.

In a shift from the previous four\u2011valent formulation, the CDC will procure a trivalent vaccine for the 2024 season.  The change follows a World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that, since March\u202f2020, no natural B\u2011type Yamagata strain has been detected worldwide, and that the strain should be removed from vaccine compositions.  CDC Deputy Director Tseng Shih\u2011hui explained that the decision was made after the 24\u202fJanuary 2024 advisory meeting of the Ministry of Health and Welfare\u2019s Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Advisory Committee.  The agency will purchase 6\u202f864\u202f910 trivalent doses, of which 6\u202f479\u202f080 are earmarked for the 114\u2011year influenza vaccination program, 185\u202f830 for central and local procurement, and an additional 200\u202f000 doses may be ordered to meet demand.  The procurement cost is about 1.57\u202fbillion New Taiwan dollars.  Five manufacturers\u2014Guangong, GlaxoSmithKline, Taiwan Oriental, Sanofi, and High\u2011End Vaccine\u2014will supply the vaccine.  Children from elementary to high school, vocational, and junior college first\u2011through\u2011third\u2011year students will receive the vaccine on campus to reduce travel for parents.  The CDC is also improving the \u201cVaccination Administration Electronic System (NIAS)\u201d so parents can sign consent online via a QR code or link, or use paper forms if preferred.

Kennedy Jr. has taken aggressive steps to overhaul the CDC and FDA. In a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Kennedy was questioned by Senator Ron Wyden about alleged statements to former CDC Director Susan Monarrez; Kennedy denied the claim, saying, 'No, I did not say that to her,' and later replied, 'Yes, sir,' when Wyden asked if Monarrez was lying. The hearing highlighted a growing political rift over vaccine mandates and pharmaceutical influence.

The move follows a tense Senate Finance Committee hearing in which Sen. Bill Cassidy criticized HHS Secretary Robert F.

By August\u202f2025, he had dismantled key federal programs: the Office of Long\u202fCOVID Research and Practice was closed, the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion was consolidated, and NIH\u2011funded clinical trials for antivirals and immunotherapies were halted. The cuts also stopped large\u2011scale cohort studies and diagnostics development. Kennedy\u2019s reorganization coincided with a Trump executive order to reduce federal bureaucracy, but the agency\u2019s actions alone bear responsibility. He has also restricted COVID\u2011vaccination access: the FDA denied approval for vaccines under 65 without high\u2011risk conditions, revoked EUA for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine in children under 5, and limited Moderna\u2019s formulation to high\u2011risk children. The CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was overhauled, replacing members with vaccine skeptics. Kennedy cut $500\u202fmillion from mRNA research, halted CastleVax\u2019s intranasal vaccine, and altered wastewater surveillance thresholds, reducing data reliability. These moves undermine prevention, research, and public health infrastructure, leaving millions of Long\u202fCOVID patients without support. The article argues that Kennedy\u2019s policies reflect an ableist, anti\u2011vaccine agenda that prioritizes political ideology over science and public health.\n\nKey metrics: a meta\u2011analysis shows vaccination reduces Long\u202fCOVID risk by ~30\u202f%; 5.8\u202fmillion U.S. children are affected by post\u2011COVID conditions; Kennedy\u2019s cuts eliminated $500\u202fmillion in mRNA research.\n\nQuotes: Kennedy said, 'Absolutely, senator, with enthusiasm.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[Counter Punch](https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/09/05/rfk-jr-doesnt-care-about-long-covid/)\n\n**Holland & Knight Health Dose: September 3, 2025**\nU.S. Congress has reconvened after its August recess for a brief session, facing a looming to\u2011do list to extend government funding beyond Sept.\u202f30,\u202f2025.

For the flu, it states that everyone six months and older should be vaccinated by the end of October; children 6 months to 8 years need two doses four weeks apart if it is their first shot; adults 65+ should receive a high\u2011dose, recombinant, or adjuvanted vaccine, while those 18\u201164 who have had a solid\u2011organ transplant are also advised to use a stronger formulation. The RSV section notes a one\u2011time vaccine for adults 75+ and for adults 50\u201174 with chronic conditions, listing the available options\u2014Abrysvo, Arexvy, and mResvia\u2014as equally recommended. Pregnant women at 32\u201136 weeks should receive Abrysvo between September and January to protect their newborns, who can alternatively receive a monoclonal antibody injection after birth. The Covid section reports that the FDA has approved an updated 2025\u20112026 vaccine for adults 65+ and for people 6 months and older with underlying health conditions; the CDC advisory panel will meet on September 18\u201119 to decide on broader recommendations, and if a narrower group is chosen, other eligible individuals may still receive the vaccine \"off\u2011label\".

It notes that the updated COVID\u201119 shots target the newest variants, while flu vaccines are updated annually to match the most likely strains for the upcoming season. The piece highlights recent federal uncertainty: the CDC director was fired, and the FDA has imposed new restrictions that could limit vaccine access and create cost\u2011related barriers. Insurance coverage for the shots is unclear, with some plans potentially requiring co\u2011pays. The author, Dr.\u202fBarron, urges readers to ignore misinformation and to get vaccinated, citing that \u201cUpdated flu and COVID\u201119 vaccines reduce severe illness, hospitalizations and deaths from respiratory viruses.\u201d She emphasizes that high\u2011risk groups\u2014older adults, people with asthma, COPD, hematologic malignancies, immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, and health\u2011care workers\u2014should prioritize vaccination. Dr.\u202fBarron also explains that vaccines do not guarantee immunity but significantly lower the risk of severe disease and enable people to continue daily activities. She advises consulting a doctor for a prescription if needed, as some pharmacies now require one for COVID\u201119 shots. The article concludes that the best time to get vaccinated is when it is convenient, because protection lasts for months and the flu season typically runs from October through May.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 02, 2025 04:27 PM\nSource:[realvail.com](https://www.realvail.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-getting-covid-flu-vaccines-in-colorado-this-fall/a23422/)\n\n**Flu season approaches**\nGlobe Gazette reports that the 2025\u201126 flu season will still rely on the annual flu shot as the main preventive measure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to recommend that all people aged six months and older receive a yearly flu vaccine, and most insurers will cover it. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert\u202fF.\u202fKennedy\u202fJr., who has previously opposed vaccines, nevertheless agreed that most people should get the flu shot. A federal panel rejected a recommendation for multidose shots containing thimerosal, but the preservative has already been removed from most flu vaccines. The vaccine for this season is a trivalent formulation that protects against two influenza\u202fA strains and one influenza\u202fB strain, with an updated A/H3N2 component that aligns with WHO guidance. Experts advise getting vaccinated in September, October, or early November so that antibody levels peak before the February influenza peak. While the vaccine does not guarantee perfect protection, it reduces the risk of severe illness and death; as William\u202fSchaffner, a Vanderbilt professor, said, 'protecting us from the most severe consequences of influenza.' Benjamin\u202fLee, a pediatric infectious diseases physician, added, 'A flu vaccine may not guarantee perfect protection against the flu, but skipping your flu shot simply guarantees you'll have no protection at all.' The FDA approved the vaccine formula on March\u202f13, and manufacturers are expected to have an adequate supply by September. Funding cuts announced by Kennedy\u2014$500\u202fmillion for mRNA vaccine development\u2014have raised uncertainty about future vaccine innovation, though no mRNA flu vaccines are currently approved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 01, 2025 07:39 PM\nSource:[Globe Gazette](https://globegazette.com/article_1598021b-1a07-42e7-b741-1279a52710df.html)\n\n**Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza...**\nCDC\u2019s 2025\u201126 influenza vaccine recommendations specify that all U.S. vaccines will be trivalent, containing the following strains: an H1N1pdm09\u2011like virus derived from A/Victoria/4897/2022 (egg\u2011based) or A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (cell\u2011culture or recombinant); an H3N2\u2011like virus derived from A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (egg\u2011based) or A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (cell\u2011culture or recombinant); and an influenza B Victoria\u2011lineage virus derived from B/Austria/1359417/2021. This updates the H3N2 component from the 2024\u201125 season. Routine annual vaccination is recommended for all persons \u22656\u202fmonths without contraindication. The CDC advises that most people receive one dose in September or October, but vaccination can continue after October as long as viruses circulate and vaccine is available. \"Vaccination during July and August is not recommended for most groups because of potential waning of vaccine\u2011induced immunity during the influenza season.\" July and August vaccination is generally discouraged except for specific groups: older adults (\u226565\u202fyears) and pregnant women in the first or second trimester should avoid July/August unless later vaccination is uncertain; children who need two doses should start as early as possible, even in July/August, to allow a second dose \u22654\u202fweeks later; pregnant women in the third trimester may be vaccinated in July/August because it protects infants. Vaccine selection guidelines state that children \u226418\u202fyears, pregnant women, and all adults should receive single\u2011dose formulations free of thimerosal. Adults \u226565\u202fyears are preferentially recommended to receive a high\u2011dose or adjuvanted vaccine (HD\u2011IIV3, RIV3, or aIIV3). LAIV3 is not recommended for pregnancy, immunocompromised persons, or those with certain medical conditions, and is contraindicated for ages <2 or >49\u202fyears. Contraindications include a history of severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component; egg allergy is a labeled contraindication for egg\u2011based IIV3s and LAIV3, but the CDC recommends that all persons with egg allergy receive an appropriate influenza vaccine. The guidance also details dosing schedules for children 6\u202fmonths\u20138\u202fyears who may need one or two doses depending on prior vaccination history, and specifies intramuscular administration volumes (0.5\u202fmL for most, 0.25\u202fmL for certain Afluria doses).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 11:48 AM\nSource:[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7432a2.htm)\n\n**US FDA Approves Updated COVID\u201119 Vaccines with New Restrictions**\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved updated COVID\u201119 vaccines for the fall season, but imposed new eligibility restrictions. The agency will allow vaccination for people aged 65 and older, and for younger individuals only if they have at least one underlying health condition. Healthy children under 18 may receive the vaccine after a doctor's consultation. However, a newly restructured advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must recommend use, and the committee has been altered to include vaccine skeptics. The approval marks the first fall\u2011winter season in which widespread vaccination of the general public and children is not recommended, putting the Trump\u2011era federal health officials at odds with national medical bodies. In a social\u2011media post, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the approvals \u201ckeep vaccines available for those who want them and require companies to conduct controlled trials,\u201d and noted a new study on \u201cpost\u2011vaccination syndrome.\u201d Public health experts view the changes as part of Kennedy\u2019s broader campaign against mRNA vaccines, citing the cancellation of a $500\u202fmillion grant for flu and COVID vaccine research, which could delay development of better treatments. The FDA\u2019s limited authorization covers two mRNA vaccines: Moderna, authorized for people 6\u202fmonths and older with underlying conditions and all over 65, and Pfizer, authorized for the same age groups starting at 5\u202fyears. The FDA also revoked emergency use authorizations for child\u2011specific formulations, making Pfizer unavailable for those under 5. The CDC\u2019s decision is expected within a month and could significantly affect pharmacy availability. Several U.S. pharmacists have expressed concern about legal liability for administering vaccines, with Minnesota epidemiologist Michael Osterholm noting, 'I hear pharmacists fear they may be held legally liable if they give vaccines. We have created an environment of fear around giving vaccines, and that is what I hear a lot.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 27, 2025 07:38 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5179914)\n\n**It's almost flu season.

The meeting was marked by the inclusion of an inaccurate and outdated presentation about thimerosal, which unscientifically affected the subsequent flu vaccine vote. The ACIP voted 5 to 2 in favor of clesrovimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody for infants, for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, the committee failed to discuss and vote on the HPV vaccine, and no vote was taken for COVID vaccines. The FDA announced the new 2025-2026 COVID vaccine formula, a monovalent JN.1 lineage, preferably using the LP 8.1 strain. Two new COVID vaccine products have been fully licensed by the FDA: a protein-based vaccine, Nuvaxovid by Novavax, and Moderna's new lower-dose mRNA COVID vaccine, mNEXSPIKE. HHS Secretary Kennedy issued a directive removing COVID vaccines from the immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, citing no new evidence to support the decision. The CDC staff gave updates on COVID epidemiology and vaccine safety and effectiveness at the meeting. The ACIP's decision to remove thimerosal from flu shots for children, pregnant women, and adults may have unintended consequences, including reducing the availability of multidose flu vaccine and increasing vaccine hesitancy. The new ACIP chair plans to reevaluate the childhood immunization schedule, the birth dose of Hep B, and the use of MMR and varicella vaccines for young children, which could further upend the child and adult vaccine schedules and sow mistrust in vaccines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/acips-june-meeting-glaring-omissions-and-shocking-addition-2025a1000i3k)\n\n**FDA gives Covid vaccine manufacturers instructions for next fall's shot**\nThe FDA has instructed Covid vaccine manufacturers to update their vaccines to target the LP.8.1 strain of the virus for the fall 2025 season, in an effort to more closely match the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The agency's expert vaccines panel, VRBPAC, debated the pros and cons of asking manufacturers to update their vaccines, with some members expressing concerns that it could trigger new testing requirements and delay delivery of vaccines. The panel ultimately voted unanimously to recommend that the 2025-2026 vaccine target a JN.1 version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The FDA's new policy, outlined in a proposed regulatory framework, also suggests that Covid vaccines will only be available to people who are at high risk of severe illness from Covid, and that manufacturers will be asked to produce human immunogenicity data to support approval of any updated product. The agency has not indicated how large those studies will need to be. Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech partnership seem to anticipate a move to LP.8.1, but Novavax, which uses a vaccine production method that requires months of lead time, may struggle to update its vaccine in time for the fall.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 12:28 AM\nSource:[STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/22/fda-gives-covid-vaccine-manufacturers-instructions-for-next-falls-shot/)\n\n**FDA advisory panel split on whether agency should require updates of Covid-19 vaccine**\nThe FDA's expert vaccine panel, the Vaccines and Related Biologics Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), was split on whether Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers should update the strain of the virus that their products target. Some members were concerned that a strain change could delay vaccine delivery, while others were unconvinced that an update would offer significantly more protection. The committee ultimately voted unanimously to target the JN.1 version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the 2025-2026 vaccine, but was divided on whether to update the version. The FDA has not yet made a decision, but is leaning towards recommending the LP.8.1 subvariant.

The policy, announced by the FDA just two days prior to the meeting, limits routine approval of COVID-19 boosters to seniors and those at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to conduct new studies to determine whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people under 65. 'This is a mess,' said an infectious disease expert, citing concerns that the new policy may prevent parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to. The FDA is also considering whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna, and. Current data suggests that the virus continues to cause 'enormous burden' on the healthcare system, with 30,000 to 50,000 adults dying from COVID-19 since October. The CDC's Dr. noted that older adults account for most hospitalizations and deaths, but COVID-19 is also a major cause of pediatric hospitalization, especially in children under 2.

    "summary": "All experts forecast a very high probability\u2014specifically 98%\u2014that the FDA will approve a seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2025-2026 flu season before October 1, 2025. Their unanimous confidence is grounded in several overlapping factors. Historically, the FDA has an uninterrupted record of annual, on-time flu vaccine approvals for over five decades, regardless of political climate or public health crises. Despite recent, unprecedented disruptions\u2014such as the cancellation of the VRBPAC strain selection meeting, replacement of expert advisory panels with skeptical members, U.S. withdrawal from WHO coordination, leadership changes, and policy turbulence under the Trump/Kennedy administration\u2014no credible evidence indicates these events have derailed or delayed the approval process for this particular flu season. On the contrary, multiple reputable news sources, CDC guidance, and FDA-related communication all confirm that the 2025-26 flu vaccine's trivalent composition was granted FDA approval as early as March 13, 2025. Manufacturers have completed production and distribution is expected or underway, matching the usual fall timeline. Minor uncertainties exist only in the form of extremely rare ('black swan') risks: a catastrophic last-minute regulatory blunder, explicit FDA reversal, or unprecedented political sabotage before the deadline. However, no expert believes these are supported by current evidence. All experts, drawing on their fields\u2014regulatory science, vaccine manufacturing, public health, and epidemiology\u2014emphasize the robust inertia, regulatory insulation, and technical maturity of the annual influenza vaccine process, especially as distinct from recent COVID-19 vaccine policy upheaval. The consensus: unless something completely extraordinary and presently undetected occurs, the 2025\u201326 U.S. flu vaccine approval will proceed as normal, with a vanishingly small probability of disruption.",
