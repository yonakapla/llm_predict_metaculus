High-profile clusters are either explained by animal vector or remain unclassified due to insufficient evidence, surveillance deficits, or reporting caution exacerbated by the US public health infrastructure shortfall.",

Rigorous investigation rules out shared animal exposures, and the CDC publicly reports that a specific individual was likely infected by another human\u2014using language such as 'likely spread from human to human' or equivalent. This could occur via enhanced surveillance, serological or genomic linkage in a well-studied cluster, or retrospective case investigation.",

Recent peer-reviewed work led by CDC scientists acknowledges past likely H2H events, but those predated the question window and have not yet resulted in revised public reporting standards or threshold crossing for current clusters. Surveillance is hampered by the US public health shutdown, which directly impedes detection, investigation, and reporting chains. Even though experts are less dismissive of the plausibility of H2H transmission, the official position remains there are 'no reported cases.' Historically, agencies are slow and conservative in officially designating H2H without clear epidemiological proof. With only about two months left before deadline and no clear signal of a near-term CDC statement changing this status, the likelihood is still nontrivial (given the volume of animal and human H5N1 infections and growing scientific concern), but remains below even odds. I estimate a 25% probability that a specific, official CDC report will emerge confirming at least one likely H2H case before January 1, 2026, with the balance of probability on the side of continued caution and inertia in case definition and reporting standards.",

However, for question resolution, an explicit CDC report linking a specific infection to human-to-human spread is necessary. The combination of: (1) rising number of mild/asymptomatic human H5N1 infections, (2) enhanced scientific scrutiny, (3) mounting evidence for isolated human-to-human events, and (4) increased pressure post-NASEM/CDC review, all push the probability much higher than the pre-2024 base rate (nearly zero), suggesting a real possibility of formal acknowledgment. However, major impediments exist: the CDC's reporting conservatism, possible institutional delays or caution post-government shutdown, and the question's dependence on a stated CDC conclusion\u2014not mere plausibility or media inference. Given ~2 months to go, this creates a classic 'knife-edge' scenario, but the recent CDC review and growing evidence make the probability much more likely than not, provided that even one clear cluster is investigated and reported according to the new scientific mood.",

Historical base rates for the CDC making such specific public attributions about H5N1 are near zero. Overall, while the anatomical and epidemiological conditions for limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission almost certainly exist today, unless a striking, well-characterized cluster emerges and is officially reported in the next weeks, the probability of formal CDC confirmation in time is much lower than the biological reality of occasional transmission. Therefore, the prediction must discount the increase in biological plausibility with the rarity and delays of official explicit reporting.",

Practically, for the CDC to declare a new case as H2H *right now* would require a near-simultaneous occurrence, exhaustive ruling out of animal/environmental exposure, sequencing, and a fast-tracked report\u2014all while the agency is hobbled by shutdown and risk-averse bureaucracy.

Second, fellow forecasters with a surveillance and epidemiological focus echoed my concerns about bureaucratic conservatism and the immense friction in updating public CDC judgments, particularly under shutdown-related dysfunction. PublicHealthSurveillance (EventBasedSurveillance)'s high estimate (72%) overstates the impact of shifting scientific tone against the realities of CDC risk communication and confirmation. No one credibly identified a current ongoing investigation or emerging cluster that might break this inertia before the end of 2025.

Arguments for a much higher probability (e.g., 72% or even mid-30s) over-index on changing scientific tone and the growing case denominator, while underweighting the notorious slowness and risk-aversion in both the CDC\u2019s communications and cluster investigations\u2014particularly as the reviewing period closes.

The study analyzed data from 10 reports identifying 18 asymptomatic H5N1 cases, including 2 with molecular and serologic confirmation (MSC) and 16 with molecular confirmation alone (MC). Two MSC cases were identified in adults in Pakistan and Vietnam through household contact investigations; one had exposure to infected poultry, while the other likely contracted the virus through human-to-human transmission, with no poultry contact. Of the 16 MC cases, 11 were found through enhanced surveillance of poultry-exposed individuals (8 in Bangladesh, 2 in Spain, 1 in the UK), and 5 were identified via contact tracing (3 in Vietnam, 2 in Cambodia). The authors emphasize the need for robust data collection from asymptomatic individuals to inform public health responses. In a related commentary, Rick Bright and Nicole Lurie note that since March 2024, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has spread among dairy cattle, with over 800 infected herds in at least 16 US states. As of mid-2025, approximately 70 human cases have been reported, mostly mild, with at least one death. High viral loads have been detected in raw milk, and live virus has been found in mammary tissue and milking equipment. Spillover to other mammals\u2014including cats, dogs, mice, wild carnivores, marine mammals, and swine\u2014has been documented. The authors challenge the traditional view that H5N1 infections in humans are always severe and that human-to-human transmission does not occur, calling attention to a critical gap in surveillance systems that focus on symptomatic illness rather than infection detection, and stressing the importance of investigating clusters for potential limited transmission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 07:16 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/review-human-h5n1-avian-flu-cases-can-be-asymptomatic-and-virus-likely)\n\n**Avian Influenza: The H9N2 Strain Could Trigger the Next Pandemic**\nThe H9N2 strain of avian influenza, previously considered less significant due to its mild effects in birds, may pose a greater pandemic risk than previously thought, according to researchers from the University of Hong Kong. Although global surveillance has focused on the highly lethal H5N1 virus, especially after its spread among dairy cows in North America, H9N2 has shown increased adaptation to infect humans. Since 1998, H9N2 has caused 173 human infections, primarily in China, according to Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong. The virus has undergone genetic changes since around 2015, making it more infectious to human cells\u2014evidenced by a 2024 sample infecting more human cells than a 1999 sample in laboratory tests. The modern strain also demonstrates improved binding to human respiratory tract receptors, suggesting adaptation for human transmission. Despite this, no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission has yet been found. Experts, including Gian Carlo Icardi from the University of Genova and Michelle Wille from the Peter Doherty Institute, stress the need for enhanced surveillance, particularly in mammals in close contact with birds, as genetic reassortment in co-infected animals could create new pandemic-capable strains. The current lack of mandatory reporting for low-pathogenicity strains like H9N2 hampers risk assessment. Researchers emphasize that ongoing global monitoring is essential to detect early signs of adaptation and prepare for potential future pandemics.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[lastampa.it](https://www.lastampa.it/salute/2025/10/29/news/influenza_aviaria_ceppo_minore_virus_pandemia-424945772/)\n\n**Video: Avian Influenza: Answers to the Most Important Questions About the New Disease**\nThe avian influenza (bird flu) has emerged as a new public health concern following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primarily affecting birds, the disease has now spread to other animals including cats and cows, and in rare cases, humans. The Robert Koch Institute confirms over 2,600 human cases worldwide since 2003, with the H5N1 variant causing particular concern; however, no human-to-human transmission has been documented. H5N1 cases are currently reported in Asia and the Americas, with outbreaks among dairy cows in the United States since March 2024. The virus has not yet been detected in Europe, but there is a potential risk of introduction via trade in cattle or beef products. Transmission occurs mainly through raw milk, not airborne routes. The risk to people working with animals is considered low to moderate. Symptoms include fever, cough, breathing difficulties, and in severe cases, pneumonia; gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting may also occur. Finland plans a vaccination campaign for high-risk groups, while Germany is not participating in the EU\u2019s vaccine procurement. Prevention includes consuming only pasteurized milk and thoroughly cooking meat. Treatment involves antiviral medications such as baloxavir, oseltamivir, or zanamivir, as antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections, according to the Science Media Center.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[RP Online](https://rp-online.de/leben/gesundheit/vogelgrippe-antworten-auf-die-wichtigsten-fragen-zur-neuen-krankheit_vid-117390457)\n\n**How Dangerous Are H5N1 Bird Flu Mutations for Humans?**\nThe H5N1 avian influenza virus, a highly contagious subtype of the Influenza A virus, is currently widespread in Germany and globally, primarily affecting birds such as cranes, but also found in various mammals including cats, bears, and seals. While human infections remain rare, with 992 confirmed cases worldwide according to the ECDC\u2014mostly in Asia, Turkey, Spain, the UK, and the US\u2014symptoms in humans range from mild eye or respiratory infections to severe pneumonia that can be fatal. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently assesses the risk to the general population as low, noting that the virus has not yet efficiently adapted to human cells. However, researchers warn that a single mutation\u2014such as the Q226L mutation\u2014could significantly enhance the virus's ability to bind to human receptors, potentially enabling human-to-human transmission. The risk of a pandemic remains low for now, but experts caution that if H5N1 were to co-infect a human with seasonal influenza, genetic reassortment could create a novel, transmissible strain, similar to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The virus has also recently infected cattle in the US, raising concerns about zoonotic transmission and the potential for contaminated raw milk to spread the virus to other livestock. While the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) considers the risk of transmission via imported dairy products as very low due to processing and lack of live cattle imports from the US, isolated cases in mammals\u2014such as an infected sheep in England\u2014have been reported, likely due to contact with contaminated equipment on farms with infected poultry. Authorities recommend avoiding direct contact with sick or dead wild birds and maintaining strict biosecurity measures in poultry and livestock farming.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 02:38 PM\nSource:[schwarzwaelder-bote.de](https://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/inhalt.vogelgrippe-pandemie-wie-gefaehrlich-ist-der-subtyp-h5n1-fuer-menschen.15a49190-ce80-4b1b-a578-aa061e0bac49.html)\n\n**Review: Human H5N1 avian flu cases can be asymptomatic, and the virus likely spreads among people**\nA scoping review by researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), published in JAMA Network Open on October 29, 2025, reveals that asymptomatic human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) occur and that person-to-person transmission is likely in certain settings. The study analyzed data from 10 reports identifying 18 asymptomatic H5N1 cases, including 2 with molecular and serologic confirmation (MSC) and 16 with molecular confirmation alone (MC). Two MSC cases were identified in adults in Pakistan and Vietnam through household contact investigations; one had exposure to infected poultry, while the other likely contracted the virus through human-to-human transmission, with no poultry contact. Of the 16 MC cases, 11 were found through enhanced surveillance of poultry-exposed individuals (8 in Bangladesh, 2 in Spain, 1 in the UK), and 5 were identified via contact tracing (3 in Vietnam, 2 in Cambodia). The authors emphasize the need for robust data collection from asymptomatic individuals to inform public health responses. In a related commentary, Rick Bright and Nicole Lurie note that since March 2024, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has spread among dairy cattle, with over 800 infected herds in at least 16 US states. As of mid-2025, approximately 70 human cases have been reported, mostly mild, with at least one death. High viral loads have been detected in raw milk, and live virus has been found in mammary tissue and milking equipment. Spillover to other mammals\u2014including cats, dogs, mice, wild carnivores, marine mammals, and swine\u2014has been documented. The authors challenge the traditional view that H5N1 infections in humans are always severe and that human-to-human transmission does not occur, calling attention to a critical gap in surveillance systems that focus on symptomatic illness rather than infection detection, and stressing the importance of investigating clusters for potential limited transmission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 07:16 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/review-human-h5n1-avian-flu-cases-can-be-asymptomatic-and-virus-likely)\n\n**Asymptomatic Human Infections With Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus**\nA scoping review of human asymptomatic infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published on October 30, 2025, analyzed 10 reports from 25 countries identifying 18 cases of confirmed A(H5N1) infection without symptoms. Of these, 2 cases were molecularly and serologically confirmed (MSC), including an adult in Pakistan (2007) with possible human-to-human transmission from symptomatic siblings and an adult in Vietnam (2011) who handled infected chickens; both were seropositive and had no symptoms. The remaining 16 cases were confirmed by molecular testing alone (MC), including 14 adults and 2 children, mostly detected through enhanced surveillance in Bangladesh, Spain, the UK, and household contact investigations in Vietnam and Cambodia. Most MC cases had high RT-PCR cycle threshold values (>30), suggesting low viral load, and some were considered potentially due to environmental contamination. Only two enhanced surveillance programs reported denominator data, with detection rates of 1% and 4% among asymptomatic individuals with animal exposure. The review highlights that asymptomatic A(H5N1) infections are rare, and robust data collection\u2014including serial respiratory and serum sampling, detailed symptom monitoring, and postexposure prophylaxis tracking\u2014is critical to assess true infection rates, duration of viral shedding, and potential for transmission. The study concludes that current evidence is limited by lack of denominator data, inconsistent symptom ascertainment, and absence of serologic confirmation in most cases, underscoring the need for prospective surveillance to inform public health risk assessments and infection control strategies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840680)\n\n**Avian Influenza in Germany: Experts Warn of Risks Despite Low Human Threat**\nThe H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in Germany has caused thousands of cranes to die and led to the culling of tens of thousands of poultry to prevent further spread. Professor Christa K\u00fchn, President of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI), explains that this year's outbreak is unusual due to its early onset and the high visibility of affected cranes, which evoke public sympathy. While previous outbreaks occurred mainly in wild birds, this year the virus has also reached poultry farms. The virus, a mutating RNA virus, varies in aggressiveness, with severe outbreaks occurring in the early 2020s and summer 2023. Though the virus has infected cows in the U.S., no cases have been found in Germany despite intensive monitoring. Transmission among cows likely occurred via milk and milking equipment, not respiratory droplets. Human infection risk is considered low, with only 70 cases reported in the U.S. (mostly conjunctivitis), and no deaths directly linked to H5N1. K\u00fchn warns against handling dead birds and urges caution during the human flu season to avoid potential viral recombination. Although vaccines exist, they are problematic: they can allow silent virus circulation (impedance), require extensive monitoring, and have severe economic consequences\u2014e.g., France lost U.S. poultry export access after starting vaccinations. Culling remains the EU-mandated standard for infected poultry, as it is both legally required and ethically necessary to prevent animal suffering. Infected carcasses are incinerated; their meat is prohibited from consumption due to contamination risks during transport. The state's animal disease control measures prioritize stopping the spread of H5N1.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:58 AM\nSource:[DIE WELT](https://www.welt.de/gesundheit/article68fa199b59e2e09750709527/vogelgrippe-es-gibt-impfstoffe-doch-sie-sind-problematisch.html)\n\n**Avian Influenza: The H9N2 Strain Could Trigger the Next Pandemic**\nThe H9N2 strain of avian influenza, previously considered less significant due to its mild effects in birds, may pose a greater pandemic risk than previously thought, according to researchers from the University of Hong Kong. Although global surveillance has focused on the highly lethal H5N1 virus, especially after its spread among dairy cows in North America, H9N2 has shown increased adaptation to infect humans. Since 1998, H9N2 has caused 173 human infections, primarily in China, according to Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong. The virus has undergone genetic changes since around 2015, making it more infectious to human cells\u2014evidenced by a 2024 sample infecting more human cells than a 1999 sample in laboratory tests. The modern strain also demonstrates improved binding to human respiratory tract receptors, suggesting adaptation for human transmission. Despite this, no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission has yet been found. Experts, including Gian Carlo Icardi from the University of Genova and Michelle Wille from the Peter Doherty Institute, stress the need for enhanced surveillance, particularly in mammals in close contact with birds, as genetic reassortment in co-infected animals could create new pandemic-capable strains.

The virus was confirmed by official laboratories and is consistent with strains previously identified in other parts of Spain during the autumn. Although the case occurred in a wild bird and not in a commercial poultry farm, it immediately triggered biosecurity and surveillance protocols established by the Ministry of Agriculture and regional authorities. All poultry farms in Navarra, especially those near wetlands or migratory bird routes, were urged to strengthen preventive measures. Navarra has over 500 poultry farms and 9 million birds, according to the Rural Development and Environment Department\u2019s 2024 data. Beni Irurita of UAGN stated that the sector is experiencing 'concern', particularly among farm operators, who are holding ongoing meetings with the Department of Animal Health. The concern stems from the fact that, despite strict biosecurity measures, the risk remains outside their control due to migratory birds arriving in winter. Irurita emphasized that the disease is classified as type A, which implies eradication is the goal\u2014making vaccination incompatible with current policy. The Government of Arag\u00f3n has responded by confining outdoor poultry farms, a measure likened to COVID-19 lockdowns. Irurita stressed that avian influenza only affects birds, though susceptibility varies by species (e.g., ducks vs. chickens), and urged the public not to panic: 'Consumers should remain calm regarding poultry meat, eggs, and other farm products.' Veterinarian Nicol\u00e1s Urbani explained that the virus has low and high pathogenicity strains, with the latter\u2014currently detected in Navarra and Aragon\u2014especially affecting migratory birds during their seasonal journey. Stressed, exhausted birds are more likely to reactivate latent infections. While the disease primarily affects birds, rare cases of transmission to mammals\u2014particularly carnivores consuming infected carcasses\u2014have been noted. In case of a farm outbreak, the protocol requires official reporting, laboratory confirmation, mandatory culling, movement restrictions, and a 10-kilometer surveillance zone (potentially expanding to 20 km). Urbani also highlighted the critical role of hunters as 'sanitary sentinels' in detecting sick or dead birds, recommending avoidance of waterfowl hunting in wetlands and compliance with the national directive prohibiting the use of calls for waterfowl hunting. The case has triggered heightened vigilance across the region.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[COPE | Noticias y radio online](https://www.cope.es/emisoras/navarra/podcast/noticias/sector-avicola-navarro-alerta-primer-caso-gripe-aviar-vivimos-horas-preocupacion-20251029_3241463.html)\n\n**H9N2 Bird Flu Virus Could Pose Human Pandemic Risk, Experts Warn**\nThe H9N2 avian influenza virus, previously considered low-risk due to its mild effects in birds, may pose a pandemic threat to humans, according to researchers led by Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong. Although H9N2 has caused 173 human infections since 1998\u2014mostly in China\u2014surveillance has focused more on the more deadly H5N1 strain, which has killed 21 people since 2020 and spread to dairy cows in North America. H9N2 is the second most common bird flu strain in humans, yet infections are likely underreported because they often cause mild or asymptomatic illness, and people are more commonly tested for H5N1. To\u2019s team found that H9N2 has undergone genetic changes since 2015, making it more infectious to human cells: a 2024 virus sample infected more human cells in lab tests than a 1999 sample and showed improved binding to human cell receptors. However, no evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission has been found. Michelle Wille from the Peter Doherty Institute notes that for H9N2 to trigger a pandemic, it must adapt to prefer human cell receptors and grow efficiently at human body temperature and pH levels. Wille stresses the need for enhanced surveillance, particularly in mammals near birds or poultry, to detect viral reassortment\u2014where genetic material from multiple viruses mixes in a host, potentially creating novel pandemic-capable strains. To warns that H9N2 genetic material has already been detected in past human bird flu outbreaks, underscoring the urgency of monitoring low-pathogenicity strains, which are not currently required to be reported by countries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 12:21 PM\nSource:[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/h9n2-bird-flu-virus-could-pose-human-pandemic-risk-experts-warn/)\n\n**Video: Avian Influenza: Answers to the Most Important Questions About the New Disease**\nThe avian influenza (bird flu) has emerged as a new public health concern following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In northeastern Germany, thousands of laying hens, ducks, and turkeys were culled preemptively. Austria is set to activate Level One of its outbreak response protocol, which includes avoiding contact with wild birds, feeding livestock only in enclosed barns or shelters, and securing outdoor water sources. Salzburg\u2019s Regional Veterinary Director Peter Schiefer emphasized strict hygiene practices for farmers, such as disinfecting equipment, using shoe changes, and preventing the introduction of the virus from the environment into farms. The situation in Germany, where over 1,000 dead crane carcasses infected with the H5N1 virus were found recently, is being closely monitored to avoid similar scenarios. According to Schiefer, avian influenza is now a year-round disease, appearing in waves. The Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) states the risk of human transmission remains low, with all known human cases linked to close contact with infected poultry or their feces. Human-to-human transmission has not been observed globally.

This marked the first widespread mammalian transmission, leading to 70 confirmed human cases by May 2025\u2014up from just one in 2022\u2014with 41 linked to contact with infected cows and 24 to poultry farms. Despite the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stating the public health risk remains 'low' and no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, global health experts are alarmed by viral adaptations observed in Kansas cattle and rising case numbers. The outbreak has triggered economic devastation: over 168 million poultry have been culled since December 2024, reducing egg supply by 7%\u201310% and driving the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs to $5.89 in February 2025\u2014peaking above $8\u2014up from $4.10 in late 2024. The USDA paid over $1.4 billion in compensation between January 2022 and November 2024. The crisis intensified in September 2025, with nearly 7 million farm birds dead, including 1.3 million turkeys, threatening Thanksgiving supplies. Wild bird infections surged, and outbreaks were confirmed in Idaho, Nebraska, and Texas. The pandemic coincided with a federal government shutdown due to partisan budget disputes, which severely disrupted the public health response. The CDC\u2019s official avian flu website displayed a notice stating it was 'under revision in accordance with a presidential executive order,' and the agency ceased publishing its vital biweekly H5N1 situation summaries starting January 17, 2025. Although emergency plans claimed essential services would continue, in practice, data collection, analysis, and oversight were halted. The CDC acknowledged delays in monitoring report analysis and inability to guide state and local health departments. Systemic damage included the dismissal of public health inspectors, freezing of NIH research funding reviews, and massive cuts to USAID personnel, leading to the abrupt termination of U.S. surveillance programs in 49 countries. The shutdown, a political choice rather than a natural disaster, turned the public health system into a casualty of partisan conflict, severely undermining the CDC\u2019s credibility as the nation\u2019s source of truth. This erosion of trust\u2014critical during any pandemic\u2014inflicted lasting damage on America\u2019s most vital intangible asset: public confidence in science and government.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:07 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://technews.tw/2025/10/28/with-h5n1-bird-flu-ravaging-the-u-s-the-federal-government-cuts-research-budgets-and-shuts-down/)\n\n**Avian Influenza in Europe and the World: June\u2013September 2025 Monitoring Report**\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a scientific report on highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Europe and globally, covering the period from June 7 to September 5, 2025. The report, produced in collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the EU Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza, provides a comprehensive overview of HPAI A(H5) detections in poultry, captive birds, and wild birds across 15 European countries. A total of 183 detections were reported, with the majority (156) occurring in wild birds\u2014particularly in colonial seabirds, especially the European herring gull. There was a noted decline in detections among waterfowl compared to previous months. In poultry, the number of affected farms was lower than in the prior monitoring period (March\u2013June 2025), and no secondary spread of outbreaks was observed. In mammals, four Arctic foxes in Norway tested positive for HPAI A(H5N5). In the United States, HPAI A(H5N1) detections in dairy cattle remained stable, while the muskrat and the round-tailed ground squirrel were reported as newly infected species. Regarding human health, 19 human cases were reported between June 7 and September 5, 2025, including three fatalities, in Bangladesh (1 case of A(H5N1)), Cambodia (11 cases of A(H5N1)), China (1 case of A(H10N3) and 5 cases of A(H9N2)), and India (1 case of A(H5N1)). In most A(H5N1) human cases, exposure to poultry preceded illness. No human-to-human transmission was documented during this period. The risk of infection remains low for the general population in the EU/EEA and low to moderate for individuals with occupational or other exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments. The report concludes that HPAI continues to circulate persistently in wild birds across Europe, with emerging mammalian infections, necessitating sustained surveillance and preventive measures. EFSA recommends long-term risk reduction strategies in poultry farming, such as avoiding high-risk areas for farms, reducing flock density in vulnerable zones, and maintaining high biosecurity standards.

The agency urged all dairy farms to strengthen biosecurity measures ahead of the upcoming fall migration season of birds. The USDA stated that there is no concern that this situation poses a risk to consumer health or the commercial milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that pasteurization effectively inactivates H5N1, ensuring the safety of pasteurized dairy products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted that H5N1 viruses circulating in birds and dairy cattle in the U.S. pose a low risk to the general public, but warned that people with occupational or recreational exposure to infected birds or mammals face higher risk and should take appropriate precautions.  'No existe preocupaci\u00f3n de que esta circunstancia represente un riesgo para la salud de los consumidores ni de que afecte la seguridad del suministro de leche comercial, afirm\u00f3 el USDA.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 06:16 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](https://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250916/3e8f1914a3274ee5a34b75d8ee4178a1/c.html)\n\n**US confirms highly pathogenic avian flu in Nebraska dairy herd**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that a dairy cattle herd in Nebraska tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13, marking the first known case of HPAI in cattle in the state. The detection followed state\u2011led tracing after an initial finding in pre\u2011movement surveillance milk samples, which are required under a federal order issued by the USDA in April 2024. Since the outbreak began in March 2024, dairy cattle infections have been reported in 17 states, though the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) notes that cases have remained confined to a small number of states this year. APHIS is working closely with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture to conduct additional on\u2011farm investigation, testing and gather epidemiological information to better understand the detection and prevent further spread. The agency urged all dairy farms to strengthen biosecurity measures, especially as the fall migratory bird season approaches. The USDA stated that there is no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health or affects the safety of the commercial milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration confirmed that pasteurisation effectively inactivates H5N1, ensuring the safety of pasteurised milk products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that H5N1 viruses circulating in birds and U.S. dairy cattle are believed to pose a low risk to the general public, but warned that individuals with occupational or recreational exposure to infected birds or mammals are at higher risk and should take appropriate precautions. HPAI is a highly contagious transboundary disease with zoonotic potential, causing variable clinical signs and high mortality rates in both wild and domestic bird populations. Current outbreaks have severely impacted countries globally, causing losses of rare and important wild bird species, as well as significant social and economic costs, including livelihood losses and egg shortages. The spread of HPAI also strains poultry\u2011related businesses, as measures such as culling and movement restrictions are necessary to contain the virus, which can disrupt the trade of poultry products. The ongoing devastation highlights the urgent need for improved control measures to prevent spillover and viral changes that could lead to a global pandemic. HPAI also infects mammals and humans, posing serious public health risks; infected mammals include domestic cats, cattle, and wild animals such as foxes and seals, with human cases, although rare, occurring in those with close contact with infected poultry or environments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 03:57 AM\nSource:[Social News XYZ](https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/09/15/us-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-flu-in-nebraska-dairy-herd/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts from a wide range of disciplines\u2014public health surveillance, veterinary medicine, epidemiology, virology, and global health\u2014offered diverse perspectives on whether the CDC will report at least one case of human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 globally before January 1, 2026. All agreed that the base rate for confirmed, officially reported human-to-human H5N1 transmission is extremely low, despite a recent surge in zoonotic cases (particularly mild and asymptomatic) linked to adaptation in mammals (notably cattle) and detection in multiple continents. The October 2025 CDC-led JAMA review marked a shift in the scientific consensus, openly acknowledging that limited person-to-person transmission has been 'likely' in past clusters; however, this report cited historical events and did not itself meet the strict resolution criteria that require a CDC public acknowledgement tied to a specific case in the relevant period.\n\nMany forecasters highlighted factors that increase the probability of a 'Yes' resolution: (1) ongoing mammalian adaptation and rising numbers of human infections, (2) recent peer-reviewed CDC analysis endorsing plausibility of human-to-human spread, (3) heightened surveillance and expert/media scrutiny, (4) the increasing pool of mild and asymptomatic cases that could harbor undetected transmission events, and (5) international pressure if a clear cluster emerges abroad. However, these are counterbalanced by substantial barriers: (a) CDC and peer agency conservatism, requiring explicit language and strong evidence to confirm human-to-human spread, (b) operational disruption to US public health surveillance and reporting due to political factors (notably a government shutdown), (c) the high evidentiary bar\u2014ambiguous, plausible, or suggestive events are insufficient, (d) historical reluctance to attribute ambiguous clusters, and (e) the short remaining window before question closure.\n\nProbabilities assigned by the experts ranged from 13% to 72%, with most clustering below 40%. Higher estimates came from those giving greater weight to the recent CDC/JAMA review and increased scientific recognition of plausibility and opportunity for detection, while lower estimates reflected skepticism that a clear, timely, formal CDC attribution would occur given operational and institutional limitations. The most optimistic expert (focused on event-based surveillance) forecast a 72% chance, emphasizing strong recent scientific shifts, but most others, especially those versed in surveillance/reporting systems and historical precedents, assigned probabilities in the teens to mid-30%s. All experts outlined plausible 'yes' scenarios hinging on the rapid detection and unambiguous confirmation of a cluster where animal exposure can be convincingly excluded and the CDC issues explicit language. Most considered a 'no' outcome more probable, given the high threshold for CDC public attribution and the short window remaining\u2014unless an unexpected, clearly documented cluster prompts a late, definitive report.",
