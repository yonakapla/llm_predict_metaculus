U.S. courts typically move slowly, especially on complex constitutional campaign questions, and the leap from a plausible cause of action to a ruling of illegality (unappealed or not stayed) by year-end is substantial. Prior case law highlights reticence to criminalize ambiguous campaign incentives unless there is egregious or widespread harm. Despite powerful signals\u2014plaintiffs have a viable claim, courts are allowing discovery, and the pre-selection of winners may bolster fraud charges\u2014no U.S. court or agency has yet ruled the conduct illegal. With the litigation timeline unlikely to yield a non-appealable, final ruling by December 31, 2025, and absent a regulatory bombshell, the base rate for mid-level campaign incentive schemes being finally determined illegal within 14 months is low. My compliance expertise thus points to a moderate but not high probability for 'Yes', likely in the 20\u201335% range, with most risk residing not in the underlying illegality (which is ambiguous) but in the litigation calendar and appellate process.

Despite public outrage and damning commentary from law professors and legal scholars, legal outcomes hinge less on public sentiment and more on the letter of the law and the ability of plaintiffs to demonstrate both intent to defraud and material harm. The news indicates that, as of August 2025, a judge has declined to dismiss the federal class-action suit and is allowing the case to move forward\u2014a significant escalation compared to previous unsuccessful injunctions. However, in U.S. legal practice, cases of this profile rarely result in a final, effective ruling of illegality\u2014particularly when powerful defendants can appeal adverse rulings and muddy the status until higher courts weigh in. Given the time left before resolution (~2.5 months), it is plausible that Musk could lose at the trial level, but for that ruling to absolutely stick (be effective and unoverturned/not stayed by 12/31) would require a rapid, unblocked process and no interim stays or higher-court interventions. The base rate for high-profile campaign finance/election law cases resulting in a clear 'Yes, illegal' outcome in the first year, sustained through all appeals and legal maneuvers, is very low. Therefore, while the probability of an initial finding of illegality is not trivial (perhaps 15\u201325%), the probability that such a finding remains legally effective and unoverturned at the resolution date is lower.",

My only constructive suggestion would be to note that, because the resolution requires an operative finding \"not overturned\" as of the resolution date\u2014not necessarily a Supreme Court conclusion\u2014the probability is driven mostly by the timing of trial-level rulings and whether any automatic stays apply. Nevertheless, your forecast is well-rooted in both legal base rates and the power dynamics at play, making your low probability defensible and historically aligned."

You rightly highlight that the class action has only just survived a motion to dismiss with no trial date set, and that appellate tactics by wealthy defendants like Musk almost always delay true legal finality beyond tight windows such as this one. Your reasoning is especially strong in noting the difference between a court signaling receptivity to claims (as here, with denial of dismissal) and actually delivering a non-stayed, not-appealed adverse verdict within months. You further recognize a material but still-sub-coin-flip risk, appropriately adjusting for the increased scrutiny and momentum compared to base rates for such cases.

Specifically, your rationale somewhat underemphasizes how the strict temporal and finality requirements (a not-overturned, on-the-record finding of illegality by December 31, 2025) strongly disadvantage plaintiffs in practice, even when judicial tone or public opinion is unfavorable to Musk. American traditions you reference often manifest not only in reluctance to criminalize gray-zone conduct, but also in reluctance to issue definitive (and unappealable) adverse rulings without exhaustive process\u2014even where discovery produces negative publicity or strong evidence. This, combined with the historical slow pace of elite-targeted campaign litigation, suggests that a probability at the higher end of your range is perhaps a shade optimistic absent explicit signs of expedited proceedings or regulatory breakthrough."

You highlight how the most probable scenario is ongoing, unresolved litigation or a technically ambiguous regulatory status by deadline\u2014matching both my own and broader academic findings on the judicial reluctance to set controversial, precedent-setting judgments quickly in ambiguous legal contexts. This defense recognizes your insight that even in the presence of strong appearances of wrongdoing, courts and agencies tend to stretch out process\u2014deliberately or otherwise\u2014especially after the immediate electoral cycle, making the window for a conclusive 'illegal' answer narrow indeed."

Moreover, your probability estimate accurately captures the elevated, though still sub-coin-flip, risk posed by the ongoing legal process without overstating the responsiveness of legal institutions to public opinion or media controversy.

While I generally lean toward skepticism regarding swift outcomes in American electoral law, your view is well-supported by examples of comparatively speedy lower court decisions in election-related matters, especially when major media scrutiny and political consequences accelerate scheduling. Thus, your calibration on the possibility of a swift, legally operative finding is a useful corrective to unduly static base rate forecasts, backing a slightly higher probability than strictly historical pacing alone would suggest."

Given the live nature of proceedings, judicial openness to the claims, and risk of a quick summary decision (however rare), I now assess the real-world odds to be at the upper end of the plausible range. Still, the overwhelming inertia of the legal system suggests any revision should be minor.

The history of high-profile election litigation still strongly supports a low chance overall, but this technical nuance means that a trial-level ruling of illegality or a summary judgment (not stayed or overturned by year-end) is sufficient for a YES outcome, and such a ruling could plausibly occur if the court acts with unusual speed or if damaging evidence motivates a brisk disposition.

Notably, the Election Law (FederalElectionCommissionRegulations) forecaster persuasively points out that the resolution does not require a final, unappealable judgment\u2014just a standing court or regulatory ruling of illegality that is not yet overturned or stayed. This nuance marginally increases the odds that a trial-level or regulatory finding within 2.5 months, if adverse to Musk and not immediately stayed, could satisfy resolution. However, other forecasters consistently demonstrate that summary judgments, even when issued quickly, are often stayed pending appeal in these contexts, and defendants like Musk will almost certainly pursue all procedural delays. The considerable historical inertia of the FEC and DOJ in unprecedented, high-profile cases also remains a major drag. The plausible risk remains, but there is not enough to justify a substantial adjustment.

Critiques of my initial forecast suggest that while my timeline and legal process skepticism are sound, I might be slightly overweighting procedural/finality risk relative to the precise resolution language: the operative outcome is any unoverturned ruling as of December 31, 2025, not final exhaustion of all appeals. That said, multiple defenses and layered reasoning among the experts reinforce that, while a negative trial-level ruling is possible, the odds that such a ruling arrives and goes un-stayed or unchallenged within the next several weeks remain low. Factors like accelerated handling of high-profile cases and evidentiary damningness arguably nudge the estimate upward, but not by a drastic amount.

The best counter-argument\u2014namely, that a surprising, rapid, trial-level ruling could occur\u2014is acknowledged but, per deeper analysis, likely means a YES is possible only in the event of unusual speed and lack of stays/appeals, which remains historically rare, especially in such high-profile, well-defended cases. The arguments for a probability in the low-to-mid 20s (rather than much lower or higher) are bolstered by ongoing case momentum, but practical realities and base rates keep the probability far below 50%. I note several forecasters are clustering tightly in the 18-28% range, and critique of upper-end probabilities (such as 25%) further supports a tilt toward the lower half of that spread.

(2) The strict resolution criterion\u2014requiring a court or regulatory finding of illegality not overturned or stayed as of December 31, 2025\u2014amplifies the temporal challenge, as emphasized by the LegalStudies and Compliance experts more than even my original analysis. (3) However, points raised by ElectionLaw (FECRegulations) warrant modest upward adjustment, namely that unusually rapid movement is possible in the wake of damning evidence or heightened public pressure, and that the bar for resolution is not absolute finality but merely a first-instance ruling not yet overturned. Even so, several constructive critiques suggest that while my base estimate captured procedural friction, the possibility of a shock summary judgment or regulatory move is not zero and should nudge the probability upward slightly.

However, the consensus also stressed the historical slowness of such cases and the absence of expedited proceedings or regulatory actions to date. The highest considered probabilities (25-28%) reflected an optimistic reading of judicial speed or a surprise regulatory finding, but the modal expert view (across law, compliance, political science) maintains a low base rate for such final findings within this narrow window, especially post-election. Thus, while it is reasonable to modestly adjust upward based on group consideration\u2014but not fully to the mid-20% range\u2014I will raise my estimate slightly to align with the broad lower bound of the most closely-reasoned forecasts, while keeping it decidedly below coin-flip territory.",

After its announcement, Elon Musk and America PAC\u2019s actions came under significant scrutiny.

Thiel warned Musk that if he followed through on the pledge, a large portion of his fortune could go to 'left-wing nonprofits' selected by Gates, whom Musk has publicly disagreed with. Thiel cited actuarial data, calculating that if Musk died within the next year, approximately $1.4 billion could be transferred to Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do -- give it to my children?' and added, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' Thiel also expressed apocalyptic concerns, suggesting that a future 'Antichrist' figure could emerge by exploiting global crises like nuclear war, AI, or climate change to seize power and establish a one-world government. He even speculated whether Donald Trump could be that figure, saying, 'Do you think Trump is the Antichrist? I will give you a hearing. And we should consider that.'

Insights from Past Laureates and Trump's Controversial Candidacy**\nThe 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, worth 11 million Swedish kronor (approximately 967,000 euros), is set to be awarded on October 10, 2025, by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo. A total of 244 individuals and 94 organizations were nominated. Donald Trump has been publicly advocated for by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who claimed Trump 'deserves' the prize due to his efforts in Gaza ceasefire negotiations, though bookmakers assign him low chances of winning. The prize money is not directed by the Nobel Foundation; recipients are free to use it as they see fit. Historically, Peace Prize laureates often donate their winnings to humanitarian causes: Juan Manuel Santos (2016) gave his entire prize to victims of Colombia\u2019s civil war; Barack Obama (2009) distributed funds to war veterans, earthquake victims, and impoverished students; and Dmitry Muratov (2022) auctioned his medal for over 100 million USD, with proceeds going to Ukrainian refugee children via UNICEF. Other laureates have used the money for research (Marie Curie, Swetlana Alexijewitsch), investments (Al Gore), or personal purchases (Paul Nurse\u2019s motorcycle, Franco Modigliani\u2019s yacht). Notably, Albert Einstein promised his future Nobel Prize money to his first wife, Mileva, in his 1919 divorce papers, and reportedly fulfilled the promise. In contrast, Trump has shown no indication of charitable intent\u2014refusing to place gifts like a state aircraft from Qatar into public ownership\u2014raising doubts about his potential use of the prize if awarded.

Thiel warned that Musk\u2019s fortune might otherwise be directed to left-wing nonprofits chosen by Gates, arguing it would be better used to fight a potential global authoritarian regime. Thiel claimed Musk was receptive to this idea. Despite Musk\u2019s public pledges\u2014such as a $6 billion donation of Tesla shares to the UN in 2021\u2014investigations revealed the funds were redirected to Musk\u2019s own foundation, the Musk Foundation, which failed to meet legal charitable donation requirements for three consecutive years. Thiel also labeled environmental activist Greta Thunberg and AI critic Eliezer Yudkowsky as 'legionnaires of the Antichrist,' framing the Antichrist as a 21st-century Luddite opposed to scientific progress. He further expressed frustration with increasing tax surveillance, stating it has made hiding wealth 'quite difficult.' Thiel, a PayPal cofounder and longtime associate of Musk and Vice President JD Vance, has been a major financial backer of conservative political causes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 02:50 PM\nSource:[Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/peter-thiel-antichrist-lecture)\n\n**Peter Thiel Reportedly Warned Elon Musk To Rethink Donating His Wealth: 'Much Worse To Give It To Bill Gates'**\nBillionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel reportedly advised Elon Musk to reconsider leaving the Giving Pledge, a commitment to donate most of one's wealth to charity. Thiel, in a series of lectures in San Francisco, expressed concern about the potential rise of an 'Antichrist' figure who could establish a one-world government by promising to solve global crises like nuclear threats, AI risks, or climate change. Thiel, known as a political benefactor of JD Vance and an early backer of Donald Trump, also shared an anecdote in which he warned Musk that, based on actuarial tables, there was a high statistical likelihood of Musk's death within a year, meaning $1.4 billion could end up with Bill Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do\u2014give it to my children?', to which Thiel replied, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' This exchange reflects the ongoing public feud between Musk and Gates, who have clashed over philanthropy, with Musk criticizing Gates for allegedly shorting Tesla stock and then requesting donations, while Gates criticized Musk\u2019s cuts to federal programs like USAID and PEPFAR. Despite their differences, both remain committed to philanthropy: Musk donated Tesla shares worth over $101 million to charity before 2025, and Gates plans to increase his foundation\u2019s contributions over the next two decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 01:25 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/10/48146278/peter-thiel-reportedly-warned-elon-musk-to-rethink-donating-his-wealth-much-worse-to-give-it-to-bill-gates)\n\n**Trumpy Billionaire Reveals He Told Musk Not to Give His Fortune to Charity**\nAccording to transcripts and audio of lectures reviewed by Reuters, Peter Thiel, a right-wing billionaire and co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, urged Elon Musk to reconsider his commitment to the Giving Pledge\u2014a philanthropic initiative co-founded by Bill Gates in 2010 that calls for wealthy individuals to donate a significant portion of their wealth to charity. Thiel warned Musk that if he followed through on the pledge, a large portion of his fortune could go to 'left-wing nonprofits' selected by Gates, whom Musk has publicly disagreed with. Thiel cited actuarial data, calculating that if Musk died within the next year, approximately $1.4 billion could be transferred to Gates. Musk reportedly responded, 'What am I supposed to do -- give it to my children?' and added, 'You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.' Thiel also expressed apocalyptic concerns, suggesting that a future 'Antichrist' figure could emerge by exploiting global crises like nuclear war, AI, or climate change to seize power and establish a one-world government. He even speculated whether Donald Trump could be that figure, saying, 'Do you think Trump is the Antichrist? I will give you a hearing. And we should consider that.'

The suit was filed by U.S. citizen Jacqueline Macaverty on November\u202f5, 2024, claiming that Musk and his affiliated political action committee encouraged voters in swing states to sign a petition in exchange for a daily $1\u202fmillion prize, but that winners never received the money and personal data were collected. Judge Robert Beaton, appointed by former President Barack Obama, said Musk\u2019s language \u2018suggested a real chance to win money,\u2019 giving the case a solid legal basis. Musk defended the effort as a voluntary political campaign, noting clear warning signs, while the plaintiff argued the goal was to influence votes for former President Donald Trump. A Pennsylvania court had earlier ruled Musk\u2019s contests were not illegal, but the Philadelphia District Attorney announced plans to seek larger damages. Musk also announced plans to form a new \u2018America Party\u2019 to challenge the one\u2011party system, but later withdrew under pressure from Republican leaders, including Vice\u2011President J.D.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, invokes the Class Action Fairness Act and alleges that the total value of all class members\u2019 claims exceeds $5\u202fmillion. It seeks damages and injunctive relief on behalf of petition signers who say they were wrongly induced to provide personal identifying information when signing the petition. The complaint names Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty as lead plaintiff and alleges that America PAC and Musk induced voters in seven battleground states\u2014Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina\u2014to sign a petition supporting free speech and Second Amendment positions by promising $1\u202fmillion daily prizes chosen \u2018randomly\u2019 until Election Day. The suit says petition signers were required to provide names, addresses, emails and phone numbers and that the defendants benefited by driving traffic to X, Musk\u2019s social platform, and by collecting valuable political contact data. It also alleges that the lottery was not random, giving voters no real chance to collect. In November, Musk\u2019s lawyers told a Pennsylvania judge that winners were not chosen at random but were selected in advance\u2014contradicting Musk\u2019s own statements when he launched the contest. U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman ruled that McAferty plausibly alleged that she had been misled and that an expert could testify about the commercial value of battleground voters\u2019 contact information. Pitman told Reuters on Wednesday: \u2018It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery \u2013 even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do.\u2019 Jarrett L. Ellzey of EKSM LLP told Newsweek: \u2018We are pleased with the Court\u2019s ruling and agree with Judge Pitman\u2019s careful reasoning.

It really is not complicated. This is just fraud; a simple, ugly fraud on the public.\u2019 The case, McAferty v.

A federal judge in Arizona on 20\u202fAugust ordered Musk to respond to the suit. The suit, filed on 5\u202fNovember\u202f2023, alleges that Musk and his America\u202fPAC misled voters in seven swing states\u2014Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North\u202fCarolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014by asking them to sign a petition promising a random $1\u202fmillion prize, while in reality the winners were pre\u2011selected and the prize was a payment for acting as a campaign spokesperson. The judge said, 'The plaintiff has reason to believe the defendant was objectively offering a chance to enter a random drawing, even if that was not the defendant\u2019s subjective intent.' Musk\u2019s lawyers have not yet responded. The lawsuit also claims that the data collected from petition signers is valuable to the PAC. Musk previously announced on 19\u202fOctober that the America\u202fPAC would give a $1\u202fmillion prize to one signer each day in the seven swing states before Election Day. The case raises questions about the legality of such voter incentives, as U.S. law prohibits bribing people to register to vote. The judge noted that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows the prize was not truly random. The lawsuit was joined by a separate civil action filed by a Philadelphia prosecutor in October\u202f2023, accusing Musk of running an illegal lottery. The article reports the facts without editorializing, so the tone is objective.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 09:35 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8m0AtrL5JRV)\n\n**Elon Musk In Trouble? Tesla Owner Faces Lawsuit For Duping Voters Over $1 Million Election Lottery**\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been ordered by a U.S. federal judge to face a lawsuit from voters who allege he misled them into signing a petition for the U.S. Constitution in exchange for a promised $1\u202fmillion\u2011a\u2011day giveaway. The plaintiff, Jacqueline McAferty of Arizona, claims that winners were pre\u2011selected, contrary to Musk\u2019s promotion of the giveaway as a lottery. U.S. District Judge Robert\u202fPitman in Austin, Texas, ruled that McAferty\u2019s proposed class action against Musk and his political group, America\u202fPAC, is valid. McAferty also alleges that America\u202fPAC unlawfully collected her personal details during the giveaway in the final stretch of the 2024 election campaign. According to the lawsuit, Musk and America\u202fPAC targeted voters in seven swing states, offering a $1\u202fmillion lottery\u2011style prize to persuade them to sign the petition, even though participants had no real chance of winning. Signers were required to provide personal details, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers. Musk denied the allegations, stating that the PAC\u2019s campaign language that the $1\u202fmillion recipients were 'selected to earn' the money and were expected to serve as America\u202fPAC spokespeople clarified that it was not a lottery. He asked the court to dismiss the case. Judge\u202fPitman noted that other PAC statements claimed the money was 'awarded' and could be 'won,' which could have led the plaintiff to believe it was a random lottery. The judge also said an expert in political data could testify on the value of voter information in swing states. Musk\u2019s lawyers and America\u202fPAC have not commented on the ruling. Musk created America\u202fPAC to support Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:18 AM\nSource:[Zee News](https://zeenews.india.com/india/elon-musk-in-trouble-tesla-owner-faces-lawsuit-for-duping-voters-over-1-million-election-lottery-2949318.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Faces Lawsuit Over 'Daily Million Dollar Election Giveaway'**\nElon Musk's 'Daily Million Dollar Election Giveaway' in 2024 was a short-lived sensation, but it soon faced a collective lawsuit from some voters. The voters filed a lawsuit on November 5, 2024, alleging that Musk used a petition to sign in support of the US Constitution as a way to lure them into participating in the daily $1 million giveaway, which involved fraudulent behavior. Musk requested a judge to dismiss the lawsuit in January, stating that he had not organized an 'illegal' giveaway. However, a US federal judge ruled on August 20 that Musk must face the voters' legal challenge. US District Judge Robert Pitman stated in the ruling that Arizona voter Jacqueline McAferty had reasonably alleged that Musk and 'America PAC' misled her into providing personal information to participate in the giveaway by signing a petition in support of the US Constitution. McAferty alleged that Musk and America PAC lured seven swing state voters into signing the petition, promising to randomly select a daily $1 million winner, but the voters had no real chance of winning. She stated that the voters who signed the petition were asked to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Musk stated in January that the daily $1 million winner was 'selected to earn' the money, and the organizers of the activity had informed the voters that they would be reviewed to see if they could become a spokesperson for America PAC and earn $1 million. Therefore, he did not believe that the money was a prize. However, the judge pointed out that the plaintiff's statements showed that the defendants had 'awarded' $1 million, and that the money could be 'won.' The ruling stated: 'The plaintiff has a reasonable basis to rely on these statements, believing that the defendant objectively provided her with the opportunity to participate in a random draw -- even if the defendant subjectively did not intend to do so.'

According to the plaintiffs, this occurred during a daily giveaway of $1 million (approximately \u20ac850,000), organized by Musk in the run-up to the recent US presidential election. A judge ruled that the complaint makes it plausible that the winners of the disputed action were not chosen randomly, but by Musk's employees. Musk wanted the case to be dismissed, but the judge has allowed it to proceed. The plaintiffs claim that Musk and his political action committee America PAC collected voter data for Trump's presidential campaign through the action, which also aimed to drive traffic to Musk's platform X. Musk had promised to pay $1 million daily to someone who signed an online petition in support of the US Constitution. However, during a previous pre-trial hearing, Musk's lawyers confirmed that the selection was not random, while Musk publicly spoke about 'randomly' distributing the money. According to the judge, this could have given voters the impression that it was a real lottery. The action targeted voters in seven swing states crucial for Trump's re-election. Signers were required to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Through a collective claim, the voters are seeking at least $5 million in damages.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 04:36 AM\nSource:[Brabants Dagblad](https://www.bd.nl/buitenland/elon-musk-moet-zich-voor-de-rechter-verantwoorden-over-geldweggeefactie-rond-verkiezingen~a6d81bd6/)\n\n**Elon Musk Faces Lawsuit Over Sweepstakes-Style Giveaway During 2024 US Presidential Election**\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest man, has been sued over a sweepstakes-style giveaway that he ran during the 2024 US presidential election. US District Judge Robert Pitman has ruled that Musk must face the lawsuit. According to Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that Musk and his political action committee, America PAC, used the giveaway to encourage voters to sign a petition in support of the US Constitution and collect their personal information. The lawsuit claims that Musk and America PAC ran the giveaway in seven key swing states, promising to randomly select a winner each day who would receive a $1 million prize, 'like a lottery', but in reality, participants had 'almost no chance of actually winning'. The lawsuit also alleges that signers of the petition were required to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. Musk had previously established America PAC to support Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. The organization was accused of using the prize promise to boost the number of petition signatures. Musk's lawyers had previously asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing 'obvious flaws' in the allegations, but Judge Pitman did not accept the motion and ruled that the lawsuit would continue. As of now, Musk's lawyers have not responded to media requests for comment. As the actual controller of Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk's public image is closely tied to his companies. This negative political news, which involves allegations of election fraud, may damage consumer trust in his brands and raise concerns among some investors and business partners. The case is ongoing.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 03:08 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8lziPLVxJjv)\n\n**Elon Musk Must Face Lawsuit Over Alleged Fraud in Giveaway**\nA US federal court has ruled that Elon Musk must face a lawsuit alleging fraud related to a giveaway. Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, sided with plaintiff Jacqueline McAferty, who claims Musk and his political action committee America PAC misled voters into providing personal data. Musk had founded America PAC to support Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. He announced in October that he would give away $1 million daily to those who signed a petition and were registered voters in one of seven key swing states. McAferty said Musk and America PAC lured voters into signing the petition by promising they could win $1 million, but the signers had no real chance of receiving the money. They were also required to provide names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. Musk had argued that the giveaway was not an illegal lottery, as the winners were chosen to 'earn' the money and were expected to serve as spokespeople for the committee. However, the judge rejected this argument, citing other statements from Musk that suggested the money was 'given' and 'won.' McAferty's lawyer said, 'It is plausible that the plaintiff relied on these statements.' Musk had also denied that the signers of the petition suffered any harm from providing their contact information. Pitman said an expert on political data brokerage could testify about the value of this information for voters in the contested states. The lawsuit was filed on election day, November 5, 2024.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 02:19 AM\nSource:[ZEIT ONLINE](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2025-08/elon-musk-betrugsvorwuerfe-usa-wahlkampf)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the consensus is that Elon Musk's million-dollar giveaway to registered voters is unlikely to be officially considered illegal by a U.S. court or regulatory body by December 31, 2025, though there remains a real\u2014albeit modest\u2014chance. Experts highlight that while there is ongoing litigation (notably a federal class action), no court or regulatory body has yet ruled Musk's actions illegal, and major rulings up to this point have allowed the giveaway to proceed. Legal ambiguity surrounds whether such inducements fall under prohibited 'vote buying' or simply constitute innovative, if controversial, civic engagement. Factors increasing the probability of a 'Yes' outcome include courts' willingness to let lawsuits proceed and evidence suggesting fraudulent or misleading winner selection. Factors weighing against a 'Yes' revolve around slow judicial processes, the likelihood of settlements or delays beyond the resolution date, base rates for similar cases (which rarely yield final rulings against novel political incentives in such a short time), and the possibility for immediate appeals or stays if an adverse ruling does occur. Regulatory bodies like the FEC are seen as slow and often deadlocked, unlikely to produce definitive findings before year's end. The median probability assigned by experts hovers in the 15\u201328% range, reflecting slight differences in emphasis but a broadly shared expectation that, absent a fast-tracked and upheld ruling, the giveaway will not be formally deemed illegal by the resolution date.",
