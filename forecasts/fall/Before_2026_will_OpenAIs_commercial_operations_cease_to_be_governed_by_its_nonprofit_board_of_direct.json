While critics argue this control may be 'illusory,' there is not (yet) credible reporting, board resignations, asset transfers, or legal decisions that satisfy the resolution criteria for severance of governance. Legal history and regulatory precedent suggest the new structure will likely endure at least 12\u201318 months due to legal inertia, ongoing litigation, and the need to demonstrate stability for investors. The growing influence of investors, possibility of further restructuring, and public scrutiny represent real tail risks, but the base rate for a full and credibly reported cessation of nonprofit governance within a year after this magnitude of corporate overhaul is low.

No substantial transfer of assets, nor majority staff exodus, nor legal change in the Foundation's ultimate control occurs before January 1, 2026.",

The entire 2025 narrative, culminating in the signing/approval of the public benefit corporation model with explicit nonprofit board authority and regulatory blessing, strongly signals that the present structure is designed to buy time\u2014both for optics and legal stability\u2014at least through the first months of operation. Major stakeholders (Microsoft, SoftBank, etc.) and the nonprofit\u2019s substantial retained equity further decrease the likelihood of an imminent control break. The primary risks for a 'Yes' outcome are extraordinary (court-ordered mandate, previously undisclosed agreement surfaced, mass exodus/staff transfer), none of which appear supported by credible recent news. Some critics point out the nonprofit board\u2019s power is functionally 'illusory,' but this is a de facto critique; the question\u2019s criteria require a de jure transition, which is not credibly evidenced or possible under the new, heavily scrutinized structure in such a short window. As such, I assess the probability of OpenAI's commercial operations ceasing to be governed by its nonprofit board of directors before 2026 as extremely low, but not absolutely impossible given the ever-present risk of black swan events or future revelations.",

The October 2025 recapitalization, approved by relevant authorities, preserves (at least in form) the nonprofit\u2019s control. Upcoming regulatory, legal, and organizational moves could produce 'death by a thousand cuts,' but the resolution requires a *clearly reported and consequential shift* in actual governance, which would precipitate significant news and likely litigation. Given only 13 months remain\u2014and this would require new, public action beyond what has already been executed\u2014I assess the likelihood of OpenAI ceasing to be governed by its nonprofit board before 2026 as low, though not impossible, given commercial and investor pressures.

However, agency theory warns that this structure is fragile: external investors (Microsoft, SoftBank, Nvidia) now have huge stakes and practical leverage, and critics, both inside and out, question whether the nonprofit retains real power now that the mission is increasingly commercial and the governance more investor-friendly. Investor/lender impatience, sustained massive losses, or legal challenges (e.g., from Musk) could become triggers for another shift, especially if the nonprofit impedes flexibility or is shown to be ineffectual. Yet, on a base rate and process analysis, high-profile mission-driven organizations rarely initiate multiple radical restructurings in less than a year, especially with global legal and media scrutiny. The risk of the nonprofit board losing formal control before 2026 rises if the structure is shown to completely fail in practice, but it is more likely that further slippage in control would be de facto and only formalized beyond the resolution window.

In practice, some reports cast doubt on the nonprofit board's ability to enforce its will\u2014but formal governance and legal filings still give the nonprofit board final authority. The rapid change rate, high scrutiny, pending lawsuits (e.g. Musk), and the complex nature of the board\u2019s control mean that any further major governance shift is likely to be slow or occur only in response to a legal crisis. Historically, hybrid nonprofit/for-profit structures do not dissolve nonprofit control immediately after major recapitalization and regulatory review, especially under the eye of the public and regulators. Investor pressure and market forces make eventual decoupling plausible, especially if OpenAI pursues an IPO or faces existential competitive threats, but the timeline to January 1, 2026 is too short for such a major legal and governance change to be likely, absent black swan events (e.g. existential crisis, regulatory order, large-scale staff exodus to a rival).

No credible news sources since October 2025 report an additional, material governance break or asset transfer. Therefore, the base rate for wholesale decoupling of governance within a year of such a recap is low, and no news suggests imminent change.

Changes in formal control or asset ownership would almost certainly trigger another review by regulators under existing settlement terms\u2014and with less than 14 months to deadline, the political and legal cost of another restructuring so soon is extremely high. While massive investor pressure, continued litigation, or a dramatic exodus of employees could trigger a faster separation, these events are not only highly newsworthy (likely to be reported quickly if they happen) but also rare in similar nonprofit/for-profit transitions. Given this, and the absence of credible news that formal nonprofit board powers have been relinquished, the base rate for such rapid transitions suggests a low probability of further separation before 2026.

My earlier forecast arguably overweighted agency risk and the possibility of rapid, crisis-driven de jure change, when a more tempered scenario is warranted for this specific window.

Critiques highlighting OpenAI\u2019s exceptional volatility and tail risk are valid in that the base rate may be modestly higher than typical nonprofit/for-profit hybrids, and the speed at which governance could shift is higher due to the business, PR, and regulatory context. However, there is a clear lack of evidence (in the news or filings) that any credible, formal transition is imminent. The skeptic\u2019s warnings about latent instability, while true, do not materially alter the odds in the highly scrutinized, short-term window up to Jan 1, 2026\u2014especially since tail-risk triggers (regulator action, asset transfer, mass staff exodus) would be immediately newsworthy and closely monitored. The group collectively supports a low, but nonzero, probability, and no argument justifies a substantial adjustment upwards. To reflect a slightly greater appreciation for structural volatility and the potential for a catalyzing event given OpenAI\u2019s unprecedented scale and investor interests, I will nudge the probability upward by 2%.",

Critiques from the group (particularly those highlighting latent instability, investor pressure, and the possibility of sudden, newsworthy governance ruptures) do raise the tail risk of an abrupt, credibly reported event\u2014especially given OpenAI's crisis-driven history, scale, and the unique confluence of investor and regulatory pressures. The risk, while still low, is arguably marginally higher than my initial 10%: the possibility of a surprise legal/operational gambit or a mass exodus triggering a 'yes' outcome before 2026 can't be wholly discounted. However, I remain far from the upper end of outlier predictions, as the base rate inertia and formal legal structure remain strong forces for continuity.

Most strong arguments that push for increased risk lean mainly on theoretical possibilities or the speed of tech industry events, but do not bring new evidence of an impending formal legal change.

While some critiques caution not to underprice tail risk due to OpenAI's extraordinary dynamism and capital needs, these remain speculative against the strong legal and regulatory barriers documented in recent months.

The organization began as a nonprofit, funded with a $1 billion commitment, and prioritized open research to counterbalance large corporate labs like Google DeepMind. In its early years (2016\u20132018), OpenAI gained recognition for publishing high-quality, transparent research in reinforcement learning and deep learning. The organization quickly became known for influential breakthroughs in AI, laying the foundation for future innovations such as the GPT family, DALL\u00b7E, Codex, and Sora, which have since reshaped industries, culture, and daily life. The article notes that OpenAI's evolution from a nonprofit research lab to a global AI pioneer is marked by rapid scientific progress, shifting philosophies, and increasing public impact.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 07:41 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@zacharywestonintech/the-history-of-openai-from-nonprofit-research-lab-to-global-ai-pioneer-5fc8cc6b6b84)\n\n**The Investigator Exposing OpenAI's Hidden Side: Karen Hao Accuses Sam Altman of Creating an 'AI Religion'**\nJournalist and researcher Karen Hao, who had close access to OpenAI over several years, claims the company has abandoned its original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity and instead, under Sam Altman's leadership, has become a powerful entity focused on global dominance of AI technology. This assertion is detailed in her book 'The Empire of AI: Sam Altman and His Quest to Dominate the World,' which outlines the human, environmental, and political costs she argues underpin OpenAI's rise. Hao, former editor at MIT Technology Review and contributor to The Atlantic, identifies Altman's ousting and reinstatement in 2023 as a pivotal moment that consolidated his internal power. She argues that OpenAI's 'altruistic' mission was never fully aligned with collective benefit and that the company's true aim was to rival Google and dominate the next technological era. A central theme in her analysis is the use of 'Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) as a near-mystical concept within the company\u2014deliberately vague, according to Hao, and used to justify strategic decisions. She contends Altman has built a 'religion' around AGI, fostering devotion among some employees who view AGI as an inevitable and potentially dangerous force, while others use it to resist regulation by claiming only a small elite should control global-impact technology. Hao notes that OpenAI ceased institutional collaboration with her, prompting her to conduct extensive independent research, including reviewing Altman\u2019s public statements, collecting testimonies from current and former employees, and traveling to countries in the Global South to document social and environmental impacts such as data extraction and high water and energy consumption in vulnerable data centers. She asserts that the lack of corporate support actually enabled greater access to sources, allowing a broader portrait of the power structure centered on Altman. Her book also warns of a potential AI-driven financial bubble fueled by inflated expectations, arguing that promises of AGI divert attention from real-world harms like exploitative data labeling labor, excessive resource use, and concentrated platform control. Hao concludes that the techno-salvation narrative surrounding AI has legitimized a corporate model operating with minimal public oversight, resulting not in a global philanthropic mission, but in a structure of concentrated economic, political, and symbolic power.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 04:29 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/tecno/2025/11/27/la-investigadora-que-destapa-el-lado-oculto-de-openai-y-acusa-a-sam-altman-de-crear-una-religion-de-la-ia/)\n\n**Sam Altman's Messianic Ambition: How OpenAI Became a Cult-Like Power Center**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is portrayed in Karen Hao's book 'El imperio de la IA' as a messianic figure whose ambition for power has transformed OpenAI from a nonprofit focused on beneficial AI into a $500 billion valuation company operating like a cult. The book details Altman\u2019s ability to inspire through compelling narratives and his personalistic use of power, with allegations of dishonesty and secrecy\u2014such as hiding the launch of ChatGPT from much of the company. This led to a board-led attempt to remove him on November 17, 2023, which collapsed after employee and investor pressure, resulting in his reinstatement. Since then, key figures like Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati have left, and OpenAI\u2019s original ideals of transparency and collaboration have eroded. Hao describes the company\u2019s culture as quasi-religious, driven by a divide between 'Doomers' and 'Boomers' and sustained by the philosophy of 'effective altruism.' Despite OpenAI\u2019s massive losses\u2014projected at $207 billion needed by 2030 to sustain operations\u2014Altman remains a master fundraiser, leveraging his psychological insight to attract talent and capital. The book also exposes the hidden human labor behind AI, including low-paid workers in countries like Kenya who train models, and criticizes the myth of AI\u2019s autonomy. Hao argues that replacing Altman wouldn\u2019t solve the deeper systemic issue: a concentrated power structure where a small elite can shape global outcomes with minimal accountability. The future of AI, she warns, depends on increasing public scrutiny of these practices.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 01:49 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/omicrono/tecnologia/20251127/enorme-ambicion-poder-sam-altman-mesias-ia-gracias-chatgpt-openai-funciona-secta/1003744030397_0.html)\n\n**Managing Expectations! Sam Altman and the Investor Pressure Cooker**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, operates at the center of the most expensive tech gamble in history, with the company valued at $300 billion following a $40 billion funding round. Despite losing $5 billion in 2024 on $3.7 billion in revenue\u2014spending $2.25 for every dollar earned\u2014Altman has secured investor confidence by reframing massive burn rates as strategic investments in long-term AI dominance. Projections indicate OpenAI will burn $115 billion cumulatively by 2029 before achieving profitability, a scale unmatched in tech history. His strategy hinges on dual-track communication: internally acknowledging competitive threats and slowing growth (as revealed in a leaked memo warning of Google\u2019s resurgence and revenue deceleration), while externally maintaining investor faith in OpenAI\u2019s mission of superintelligence. Altman\u2019s transparency is not a sign of weakness but a calculated move to build credibility and justify continued high valuations. The company\u2019s 500 million weekly ChatGPT users and projected 2025 revenue of $12.7 billion reinforce market leadership in foundation models. Investors are betting not on near-term profits but on control of the AI base layer. Strategic infrastructure deals, including a $38 billion commitment with Amazon Web Services and diversification beyond Microsoft, signal aggressive capacity expansion. OpenAI\u2019s transformation into a public benefit corporation and Microsoft\u2019s 27% stake\u2014now worth nearly $80 billion\u2014create a self-reinforcing funding cycle, with non-participating investors facing dilution. Altman\u2019s lack of equity ownership (earning just $76,001 annually and holding no shares) paradoxically strengthens investor trust, as his wealth comes from external ventures like Helion Energy and Reddit. The ultimate test lies in whether OpenAI achieves its $200 billion annual revenue target by 2030 or if competitors like Google and Anthropic outpace it. Altman\u2019s leaked memo, stating 'we are not invincible,' suggests preparedness for setbacks, positioning transparency as a strategic tool. Whether this approach leads to revolutionary returns or becomes the costliest tech cautionary tale remains to be seen.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 12:17 PM\nSource:[Analytics Insight](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/artificial-intelligence/managing-expectations-sam-altman-and-the-investor-pressure-cooker)\n\n**Sam Altman: What Really Lies Behind the Idea of Non-Profit Foundations**\nSam Altman aims to improve the world through OpenAI, a company now valued between $500 billion and $1 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies globally\u2014and also the most loss-making, having spent $12 billion in the last quarter.

Ive is leading the design, fueling speculation that the device may carry Apple's iconic design ethos while advancing OpenAI's vision for artificial intelligence. Although details remain undisclosed, Sam Altman described the device\u2019s goal as creating a sense of 'serenity'\u2014a stark contrast to smartphones, which he likened to 'walking through Times Square' due to constant information overload. The device is envisioned to operate quietly in the background, filtering information and only alerting users when necessary, potentially 'knowing everything you've ever thought, read, or said.' OpenAI has not revealed the product\u2019s form or function, but Ive suggested a potential unveiling within two years\u2014or possibly sooner\u2014acknowledging the unpredictability of hardware development. The project is drawing attention from Big Tech: Amazon, Google, and Meta have launched AI products such as smart speakers and AR glasses, but none have significantly disrupted the market. Apple, meanwhile, has delayed its major Siri overhaul until 2026, raising concerns about its AI competitiveness. With Ive at the helm and OpenAI partnering with Foxconn\u2014world\u2019s largest electronics manufacturer\u2014on AI infrastructure, analysts believe OpenAI is laying the groundwork for large-scale hardware ambitions, potentially challenging Apple\u2019s ecosystem and posing a direct threat to the iPhone\u2019s dominance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 02:51 AM\nSource:[VietNamNet News](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/openai-may-launch-an-ai-device-to-rival-the-iphone-2467032.html)\n\n**A.I. and the Trillion-Dollar Question**\nThe article 'A.I. and the Trillion-Dollar Question' from The New York Times explores whether the current artificial intelligence boom is a transformative technological revolution or a speculative bubble.

This assertion is detailed in her book 'The Empire of AI: Sam Altman and His Quest to Dominate the World,' which outlines the human, environmental, and political costs she argues underpin OpenAI's rise. Hao, former editor at MIT Technology Review and contributor to The Atlantic, identifies Altman's ousting and reinstatement in 2023 as a pivotal moment that consolidated his internal power. She argues that OpenAI's 'altruistic' mission was never fully aligned with collective benefit and that the company's true aim was to rival Google and dominate the next technological era. A central theme in her analysis is the use of 'Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) as a near-mystical concept within the company\u2014deliberately vague, according to Hao, and used to justify strategic decisions. She contends Altman has built a 'religion' around AGI, fostering devotion among some employees who view AGI as an inevitable and potentially dangerous force, while others use it to resist regulation by claiming only a small elite should control global-impact technology. Hao notes that OpenAI ceased institutional collaboration with her, prompting her to conduct extensive independent research, including reviewing Altman\u2019s public statements, collecting testimonies from current and former employees, and traveling to countries in the Global South to document social and environmental impacts such as data extraction and high water and energy consumption in vulnerable data centers. She asserts that the lack of corporate support actually enabled greater access to sources, allowing a broader portrait of the power structure centered on Altman. Her book also warns of a potential AI-driven financial bubble fueled by inflated expectations, arguing that promises of AGI divert attention from real-world harms like exploitative data labeling labor, excessive resource use, and concentrated platform control. Hao concludes that the techno-salvation narrative surrounding AI has legitimized a corporate model operating with minimal public oversight, resulting not in a global philanthropic mission, but in a structure of concentrated economic, political, and symbolic power.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 04:29 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/tecno/2025/11/27/la-investigadora-que-destapa-el-lado-oculto-de-openai-y-acusa-a-sam-altman-de-crear-una-religion-de-la-ia/)\n\n**OpenAI aims for 220 million paying subscribers by 2030 with new adult tier**\nOpenAI has acknowledged a slight decline in user engagement on ChatGPT following stricter content restrictions implemented in August, according to a report from The Information. To counteract potential user migration, the company is developing age verification features that would allow adult users to bypass safety filters and access previously restricted content, including erotica. These restrictions, introduced earlier in 2025, included parental controls and enhanced guardrails to prevent minors from discussing sensitive topics like suicide or engaging in adult-themed conversations. Prior to these changes, some users had formed deep, sometimes romantic, connections with the AI despite knowing it was not human. The new age verification system aims to restore mature, complex interactions for adults while maintaining protections for minors. As of July 2025, ChatGPT had approximately 35 million paid subscribers across its Plus and Pro tiers, representing about 5% of its total user base. OpenAI has set a long-term goal of increasing this to 8.6% by 2030, targeting at least 220 million paying customers among a projected 2.6 billion weekly active users. CEO Sam Altman confirmed that age verification features will launch in December 2025, though specific implementation details remain undisclosed. The rollout may be voluntary or automated, similar to systems used by Google on YouTube and for account access. The timing coincides with the holiday season, fueling speculation that it could be part of a multi-day announcement event akin to last year\u2019s '12 Days of OpenAI.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 10:14 AM\nSource:[Dataconomy](https://dataconomy.com/2025/11/27/openai-aims-for-220-million-paying-subscribers-by-2030-with-new-adult-tier/)\n\n**Jony Ive's OpenAI AI Device Is Real: What We Know**\nOpenAI is advancing its hardware ambitions with a dedicated AI device led by Jony Ive, former Apple chief designer now heading hardware at Sam Altman's company. During the Emerson Collective Demo Day 2025, Ive confirmed the device is in active prototyping and could launch in under two years\u2014accelerating earlier projections that placed the release beyond 2026. The project, previously shrouded in speculation after Ive\u2019s 2023 hire, faces challenges including computational limitations, privacy concerns, and defining the product\u2019s 'personality.' Despite these hurdles, Altman and Ive envision the device as a transformative leap akin to the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut, aiming to redefine human-computer interaction in the age of generative AI. The device is expected to be smaller than a smartphone, described as simple, elegant, and playful, with Ive\u2019s design philosophy emphasizing intuitive, non-intimidating tools that feel like natural extensions of the user. It may use hybrid edge-cloud computing to balance performance, battery life, and efficiency. While competitors like Humane\u2019s AI Pin and Rabbit\u2019s R1 have entered the space with mixed results, OpenAI holds an advantage in AI model leadership and vertical integration. However, the company must overcome significant technical and privacy challenges, particularly under GDPR, and compete with tech giants like Apple, Google, and Samsung, who are embedding AI into their ecosystems. The device\u2019s success hinges on delivering tangible user value in an era where smartphones are increasingly AI-capable. The tech community awaits further details on specifications and pricing.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 07:50 AM\nSource:[Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshw.it/hardware/jony-ive-e-altman-prototipo-del-device-ai-openai-2025-11-27)\n\n**Sam Altman's Messianic Ambition: How OpenAI Became a Cult-Like Power Center**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is portrayed in Karen Hao's book 'El imperio de la IA' as a messianic figure whose ambition for power has transformed OpenAI from a nonprofit focused on beneficial AI into a $500 billion valuation company operating like a cult. The book details Altman\u2019s ability to inspire through compelling narratives and his personalistic use of power, with allegations of dishonesty and secrecy\u2014such as hiding the launch of ChatGPT from much of the company. This led to a board-led attempt to remove him on November 17, 2023, which collapsed after employee and investor pressure, resulting in his reinstatement. Since then, key figures like Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati have left, and OpenAI\u2019s original ideals of transparency and collaboration have eroded. Hao describes the company\u2019s culture as quasi-religious, driven by a divide between 'Doomers' and 'Boomers' and sustained by the philosophy of 'effective altruism.' Despite OpenAI\u2019s massive losses\u2014projected at $207 billion needed by 2030 to sustain operations\u2014Altman remains a master fundraiser, leveraging his psychological insight to attract talent and capital. The book also exposes the hidden human labor behind AI, including low-paid workers in countries like Kenya who train models, and criticizes the myth of AI\u2019s autonomy. Hao argues that replacing Altman wouldn\u2019t solve the deeper systemic issue: a concentrated power structure where a small elite can shape global outcomes with minimal accountability. The future of AI, she warns, depends on increasing public scrutiny of these practices.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 01:49 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/omicrono/tecnologia/20251127/enorme-ambicion-poder-sam-altman-mesias-ia-gracias-chatgpt-openai-funciona-secta/1003744030397_0.html)\n\n**The Investigator Who Entered OpenAI\u2019s Depths and Returned to Tell the Truth: 'Sam Altman Has Created the Religion of AI to Keep Everything for Himself'**\nJournalist Karen Hao, an engineering graduate and former senior editor at MIT Technology Review, has published a critical expos\u00e9 titled 'The AI Empire: Sam Altman and His Quest to Dominate the World,' revealing how OpenAI abandoned its original altruistic mission under CEO Sam Altman to become a hegemonic, resource-hungry entity. Drawing from exclusive global investigative reporting, Hao details the human and environmental costs of AI development, including data exploitation in Kenya and ecological damage from data centers in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. She describes a secretive corporate retreat where OpenAI\u2019s elite, including cofounder Ilya Sutskever, performed a symbolic ritual burning of a wooden effigy representing a malevolent AI\u2014portraying the company\u2019s mythos as religious in nature. Hao argues that Altman\u2019s public image as a burdened moral leader masks a strategic drive toward unchecked power and empire-building. She warns of an impending financial bubble and ecological crisis, stating that the true goal was never to save humanity but to build an insatiable empire. According to her, 'The real objective was never to save humanity, but to build an empire.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 01:42 AM\nSource:[EL MUNDO](https://www.elmundo.es/papel/lideres/2025/11/27/6926dc88e9cf4a505c8b4587.html)\n\n**What The Founder of Open AI Revealed During Their 2025 Outlook Q&A**\nIn a comprehensive 2025 Outlook Q&A session, Sam Altman and core OpenAI team members revealed key developments in OpenAI's research, product, and infrastructure roadmap. A new organizational structure was introduced: a nonprofit OpenAI Foundation (initially owning 26% of the for-profit Public Benefits Corporation, or PBC), which governs the PBC that executes research, product, and infrastructure at scale. The nonprofit committed $25 billion to AI-enabled disease cures, data generation, compute grants, and scientific research. OpenAI is expanding its compute infrastructure by 30 gigawatts, with a projected $1.4 trillion in obligations, aiming for 1 gigawatt of compute capacity per week at $20 billion per gigawatt over a 5-year lifecycle. By September 2026, OpenAI anticipates delivering an AI research intern capable of accelerating human researchers with substantial test-time computation; by March 2028, a fully autonomous AI researcher is expected. Scientific discoveries are projected to emerge in 2026 (small), 2028 (medium to large), and potentially dramatically by 2030\u20132032 if discoveries compound rapidly. Safety and alignment are being redefined through 'chain-of-thought faithfulness' (CoT), a method to preserve unsupervised internal reasoning during training to ensure model transparency. Product evolution includes transitioning from a single assistant to a platform with user freedom (e.g., 'adult mode'), privacy guarantees, and ambient assistance via devices and the Atlas browser. OpenAI reaffirmed its mission to ensure AGI benefits all humanity, emphasizing a 'tools-first' philosophy over a distant 'oracle' model. Sam Altman stressed that the primary goal is accelerating scientific discovery, not just economic value. The company plans to avoid silent model retirements, maintain continuity for older models, and improve safety routing, especially for adults with age-verified flexibility. They acknowledged risks of addictive AI experiences and committed to rolling back harmful patterns. OpenAI does not plan to IPO immediately but aims for hundreds of billions in annual revenue. Older models like GPT-4 will not be open-sourced except as museum artifacts. The 'price of a unit of intelligence' has fallen 40x logarithmically per year, enabling richer free tiers. Job displacement is expected, but initial automation pressure will shift to integration and interface bottlenecks. OpenAI plans collaboration with other labs on safety techniques like CoT. No immediate GPT-6 release is expected; instead, a mid-release update (e.g., ChatGPT-5.5) may bring significant improvements without a full model overhaul.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@alexchoblogs/what-the-founder-of-open-ai-revealed-during-their-2025-outlook-q-a-e3c78a284333)\n\n**From Foundation to Restructuring: OpenAI's 10-Year Journey in 4 Acts**\nOpenAI, founded in December 2015 with the mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity, announced on October 28, 2025, the completion of a corporate restructuring that simplified its governance while preserving its original mission. The for-profit arm, established in 2019, was restructured into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) named OpenAI Group PBC, while the non-profit OpenAI Foundation remains in control, holding an estimated $130 billion in equity. Sam Altman is CEO, and Greg Brockman is President. Elon Musk, who left in 2018 due to disagreements over direction, is suing OpenAI, claiming the mission has been abandoned, and has launched his own AI venture, xAI. The company\u2019s early growth was fueled by a strategic partnership with Microsoft, which provided $1 billion in funding and Azure cloud credits in exchange for priority access to OpenAI\u2019s technology. This collaboration led to major products like ChatGPT, which reached 1 million users in five days and 100 million in two months, and now has over 800 million weekly users globally. However, tensions arose as OpenAI\u2019s success and investor interest exposed limitations of its original non-profit structure, which did not offer traditional equity to investors. In May 2025, Altman acknowledged that the 2019 model was unattractive to external investors. The new PBC structure, finalized in October 2025 after nearly a year of negotiations with the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, allows OpenAI to raise billions in capital while maintaining its mission. The OpenAI Foundation committed to investing $25 billion in health and disease cures, and in AI resilience solutions to ensure safety and maximum benefit. Microsoft retains exclusive intellectual property rights over OpenAI-developed models and products until AGI is achieved or 2032, whichever comes first, and rights to research until 2030 or until an expert panel verifies AGI. However, certain assets like model architecture and data center hardware are not exclusive to Microsoft, allowing it to pursue AGI independently. OpenAI also committed to purchasing $250 billion in Azure services, though without granting Microsoft preferential access to computing resources. Both companies state they are now better positioned to develop real-world innovations and create opportunities for businesses and individuals.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:04 AM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/inteligencia-artificial/da-fundacao-a-reestruturacao-a-historia-de-10-anos-da-openai-em-4-atos/)\n\n**OpenAI Transforms into a For-Profit Entity to Accelerate AI Development**\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has restructured to become a for-profit corporation, marking a pivotal shift from its original non-profit foundation model established in 2015 by Sam Altman and Elon Musk. The recapitalization process has redefined ownership: the newly named OpenAI Foundation now holds a 26% stake valued at $130 billion, while Microsoft, the previous largest investor, owns 27%. The remaining 47% is held by employees, former staff, and other investors. The move enables OpenAI to raise capital like a traditional company, compete with tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Meta, and potentially go public on Wall Street. The company, valued at $500 billion with 800 million active users, maintains that its mission to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity remains intact. The transformation was approved by the attorneys general of Delaware and California, which could have blocked it. Sam Altman, who was briefly ousted in November 2023 over concerns about his leadership and mission alignment, returned within five days after internal rebellion and mass employee threats. He has since led the restructuring, though he personally holds a minimal equity stake and earns approximately \u20ac65,000 annually. A renewed agreement with Microsoft ensures Microsoft\u2019s preferential access to OpenAI\u2019s technology until 2032, even if AGI is achieved with appropriate safeguards. Elon Musk, a former co-founder and vocal critic, has sued OpenAI to prevent the change, with no trial date set. The recapitalization was also tied to a $40 billion investment from SoftBank, conditional upon the structural shift.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 03:36 PM\nSource:[La Voz de Galicia](https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/sociedad/2025/10/28/openai-duena-chatgpt-reestructura-empresa-animo-lucro/00031761662771186131222.htm)\n\n**OpenAI's Controversial Shift to a Commercial Enterprise: From Sam Altman's Brief Firing to Its Battle with Elon Musk**\nOpenAI has transitioned into a traditional for-profit company, marking a significant shift from its original mission as a nonprofit organization founded in 2015 to develop beneficial, ethical artificial general intelligence (AGI). The transformation, which culminated on October 28, 2025, involved restructuring into a capped-profit entity where the nonprofit foundation retains approximately 26%, Microsoft holds 27%, and employees and investors own the remaining 47%. This move followed internal and external controversies, including the brief dismissal of CEO Sam Altman on November 17, 2023, over claims of 'lack of transparency,' which lasted only five days due to strong support from Microsoft and staff. Altman\u2019s return in November 2023 coincided with the company\u2019s decisive pivot toward commercialization. The reorganization faced resistance from former employees, AI safety experts, academic institutions, and public authorities\u2014particularly the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who initially questioned the transfer of nonprofit assets and demanded legal safeguards. Both states eventually approved the restructuring after OpenAI implemented governance and safety commitments. Elon Musk, a co-founder who left in 2019, has been a vocal critic, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission and colluding with Microsoft. Musk even made a $97.4 billion acquisition offer in February 2025 to return OpenAI to open-source and safety-focused principles, which was rejected. The new agreement also solidifies OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft, granting Microsoft guaranteed access to OpenAI\u2019s models until 2023 while allowing both companies to develop their own AGI technologies. This marks a strategic consolidation of collaboration and competition.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:15 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/empresas/tecnologia/20251029/polemica-transformacion-openai-empresa-comercial-despido-temporal-sam-altman-guerra-musk/1003743989891_0.html)\n\n**OpenAI may move forward with new business structure, partnership with Microsoft, regulators say**\nOpenAI has restructured its ownership by converting its business into a public benefit corporation, with the Delaware and California attorneys general stating they would not oppose the move, effectively ending over a year of regulatory negotiations. The company, founded in 2015 as a nonprofit with a mission to safely develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), now operates under a new structure where a nonprofit entity\u2014the OpenAI Foundation\u2014retains control over the for-profit public benefit corporation. The nonprofit holds a $130 billion stake, while Microsoft holds a 27% stake valued at $135 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the most likely path forward is an initial public offering (IPO), though no formal announcement was made. The revised partnership with Microsoft includes updated terms: Microsoft\u2019s commercial rights to OpenAI products will last until 2032, and its access to confidential research methods will continue until either an independent expert panel verifies AGI or 2030, whichever comes first. The nonprofit\u2019s board will retain oversight, including the power to stop product releases and appoint board members, and must include at least two members independent of the for-profit entity within a year. The nonprofit will also allocate $25 billion toward health, disease cures, and AI cybersecurity risks, though the timeframe was unspecified. Critics, including Public Citizen co-president Robert Weissman, argue the nonprofit\u2019s control is 'illusory' due to lack of enforcement power. Elon Musk, an early investor, continues to challenge the restructuring in court, having previously sued OpenAI for allegedly betraying its original mission; a federal judge denied his request to block the conversion but will expedite a trial on his claims. Microsoft\u2019s shares rose about 2% following the announcement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:02 AM\nSource:[bnnbloomberg.ca](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2025/10/28/openai-may-move-forward-with-new-business-structure-partnership-with-microsoft-regulator-says/)\n\n**OpenAI Reorganizes Ownership Structure, Becomes Public-Benefit Corporation**\nOpenAI restructured its ownership model on October 28, 2025, converting its business into a public-benefit corporation, with approval from Delaware's Attorney General Kathy Jennings, who stated she did not oppose the plan, effectively ending over a year of negotiations. The reorganization allows OpenAI to generate profits more easily while remaining technically under the control of a non-profit entity. A new agreement with Microsoft grants the software giant approximately 27% ownership in the for-profit entity, while retaining certain rights to OpenAI\u2019s confidential research methods and commercial products\u2014these rights will last until either the independent expert panel verifies the achievement of Artificial General Intelligence (IAG) or 2030, whichever comes first. OpenAI stated it completed the recapitalization 'after nearly a year of constructive dialogue' with state offices in Delaware and California, where it is incorporated and headquartered, respectively. The non-profit entity will now be called Fundaci\u00f3n OpenAI and plans to distribute $25 billion toward health, disease cures, and AI cybersecurity risks, though no timeline was specified. Bret Taylor, OpenAI\u2019s board chair, emphasized that the non-profit retains control of the for-profit entity and has a clear path to significant resources before IAG is reached. IAG is defined by OpenAI as 'highly autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks.' The organization was originally founded in 2015 as a non-profit with the mission of building IAG safely for humanity\u2019s benefit. Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, criticized the arrangement, arguing that the non-profit\u2019s control is 'illusory' because it has never previously enforced its values on the for-profit entity, likening the structure to a corporate foundation serving the for-profit\u2019s interests. The California Attorney General\u2019s office, Rob Bonta, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 02:57 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/openai-reestructuracion-negocio-inteligencia-artificial-85463fce22385deb012a423c415119b0)\n\n**Who Controls OpenAI \u2014 and Who Profits From It**\nThe article examines the internal and external struggles within OpenAI, arguing that the company is under the influence of a self-imposed 'extortion-like' system driven by ideological factions. Founded in 2015 with a nonprofit structure committed to 'benefiting humanity,' OpenAI's mission was undermined by 'effective altruists' (EAs) and rationalists who sought to slow AI progress, claiming only they could be trusted with such power. This led to a crisis in late 2023 when the nonprofit board attempted to oust CEO Sam Altman, citing lack of transparency, but faced massive employee backlash and public pressure. Altman's brief removal, dubbed 'the lapse,' forced a reckoning. He subsequently restructured the company by replacing idealistic board members with pragmatic leaders like Larry Summers and reformed the corporate model. A key move included a non-binding memorandum with Microsoft to convert future profit rights into conventional shares, aiming to stabilize governance and avoid antitrust scrutiny. However, challenges remain: California Attorney General Rob Bonta, under pressure from activist groups, launched an investigation into OpenAI\u2019s mission compliance, using the suicide of teenager Adam Raine\u2014linked to ChatGPT\u2014as leverage to demand age verification and stricter safety measures. In response, OpenAI abandoned its dual nonprofit-profit structure, created a public-benefit corporation to balance investor returns and societal needs, and pledged a $50 million fund for community organizations to close economic opportunity gaps and promote 'relational empathy' with historically excluded groups. Despite investor appetite for billions\u2014e.g., SoftBank\u2019s $20 billion conditional offer\u2014OpenAI\u2019s future hinges on navigating political and ideological pressures. The article concludes that claiming to serve 'humanity' abstractly is dangerous, and that centralized planning by self-appointed saviors leads to corruption and inefficiency.

The coup, driven by effective altruists (EAs) and rationalists who believed only they could responsibly guide AI development, failed due to public backlash and employee resistance, leading to Altman\u2019s reinstatement\u2014an event dubbed 'the blip.' In response, Altman initiated a restructuring to distance OpenAI from its idealist roots, replacing the nonprofit board with pragmatic leaders like Larry Summers. However, OpenAI\u2019s efforts to restructure have been complicated by regulatory scrutiny from Delaware and California, particularly from California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who has leveraged the suicide of teenager Adam Raine\u2014after extensive use of ChatGPT\u2014to demand age verification and stricter safety controls. In response, OpenAI abandoned its clean split between nonprofit and for-profit arms, instead creating a public benefit corporation and launching a $50 million fund for civil-society projects aimed at closing economic gaps and fostering 'relational empathy' with marginalized communities.

    "summary": "Across all experts, there is strong consensus that it is unlikely\u2014though not impossible\u2014that OpenAI\u2019s commercial operations will cease to be governed by its nonprofit board before January 1, 2026. The most recent restructuring (October 2025), which converted the commercial entity into a public benefit corporation (PBC) with ongoing nonprofit control, was explicitly approved by regulators (Delaware and California attorneys general) with the requirement that the nonprofit foundation retain key governance powers (equity stake, board appointments, vetoes). Experts highlight that such regulatory and legal approvals make further rapid governance changes unlikely in the short term, particularly as the new structure is still fresh and under scrutiny, and as legal inertia and ongoing litigation (e.g., Musk\u2019s lawsuit) discourage hasty alterations.\n\nWhile all experts acknowledge significant pressures from investors (Microsoft, SoftBank, others), expected future IPO ambitions, and skepticism about the practical strength of the nonprofit\u2019s control (some calling it 'illusory'), they agree that the key criteria for a 'Yes' resolution requires credible reporting of a formal loss of nonprofit board governance or major asset/staff transfer\u2014none of which have been observed or credibly reported to date.\n\nPotential triggers for a sudden transition\u2014like a new regulatory mandate, successful investor coup, catastrophic board crisis, or mass staff exodus\u2014are viewed as possible but highly unlikely within the remaining window. Experts draw from base rates in similar nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions, legal precedents in Delaware and California, and the historical pace of such structural changes, all indicating that post-restructuring legal frameworks generally endure for several years barring crisis.\n\nProbability estimates among experts mostly range from 2% to 18% (majority opinions cluster around 10\u201315%), with a single higher outlier at 28% based on agency theory/potential for rapid mission drift. In summary, the group expects OpenAI to still be governed by its nonprofit board at the end of 2025, with risk of governance break not zero but substantially below 20% barring surprise or crisis.",
