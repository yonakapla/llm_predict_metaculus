With only 2 months left, a last-minute breakthrough or PR gambit is possible, especially from unpredictable figures (Musk/Zuckerberg), but the absence of such a claim to date (despite many tempting opportunities) tips the balance strongly toward No. Thus, while larger than zero, the chance of a qualifying claim in 2025 appears low, but not vanishing; I judge the current likelihood to be:",

Even figures like Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis, with strong AGI ambitions, repeatedly state their systems are not yet meeting their own AGI criteria. Competitive hype does increase pressure to make bold claims, and rogue actors like Elon Musk are more likely to embrace borderline statements\u2014but as of late October 2025, neither Musk nor others have actually made a qualifying, unambiguous AGI claim.

However, the present saturation of concern (open letters, global moratoria calls, vocal public anxiety), recent reputational missteps (e.g., OpenAI's public walkbacks on overstated achievements), regulatory uncertainty, and a strong drift toward the 'slope of disillusionment' in the hype cycle collectively dampen the odds. The likely scenario is that labs continue aggressive development and careful marketing, making strong but not definitive claims through the end of 2025. Nonetheless, the possibility of a strategic, opportunistic claim headlining a media cycle or competitive launch (particularly from xAI or OpenAI) cannot be discounted.

On top of that, your forecast accurately weighs the softening boundary of the 'AGI' term due to competitive, ambiguous corporate messaging, and you don't let that ambiguity swamp your assessment of reputational danger and the social risk calculus. You recognize that a Yes is possible\u2014a bold competitive play or a triggering event\u2014but not probable given the incentives to hedge.

Headlines about continuous learning or \"approaching AGI\" sap the PR advantage that a real claim would provide\u2014without any of the catastrophic downside risk. To say these conditions make a public AGI proclamation more likely is like arguing that the threat of nuclear war makes a launch more probable\u2014when in fact, it incentivizes maximum brinkmanship while holding back from the precipice.

Too much is at stake for any CEO to throw the match just for media attention, especially when they can harvest anticipation (and funding) by keeping the suspense alive.

Your argument discounts the history of oversteps (GPT-5, 'solved' problems fiasco) that proved the downsides outweigh even the fattest hype bonuses. Who cares if the probability of a technical leap surges, when the probability of a *clean*, CEO-level, on-the-record AGI declaration\u2014per the fine print\u2014is still throttled by the logic of agenda setting, reputational exposure, and narrative control?

The original question opened on 2024-12-20 20:59:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/30923). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nProgress in artificial intelligence has surged in recent years with generative AI tool adoption [surging in the corporate world](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), and use by a significant portion of the US public for [writing](https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2024/08/08/c472d/1) and for [help in making decisions](https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2024/11/21/b9187/1).\n\nThe rapid AI development has raised questions about the potential of achieving [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) (AGI). Definitions of AGI vary, but in general most definitions align with the interpretation of an AI system operating at or above human level in a broad range of tasks. A number of thinkers have [expressed concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence) about risks to humanity posed by the development of AGI and a majority of Americans described their feelings about advances in AI development as \"cautious\" in a [March 2024 survey](https://today.yougov.com/technology/articles/49099-americans-2024-poll-ai-top-feeling-caution). However, some top AI labs have explicitly targeted AGI development as a goal they are pursuing, including [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/), [DeepMind](https://www.theverge.com/23778745/demis-hassabis-google-deepmind-ai-alphafold-risks), and [Meta](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24042354/mark-zuckerberg-meta-agi-reorg-interview).\n\nThere is much uncertainty and [disagreement](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316969/mustafa-suleyman-sam-altman-microsoft-openai-agi) about when AGI will be achieved, in part because of the varying definitions. While fuzzy definitions might make it difficult to clearly discern when AGI has arrived (for example, see a [recent claim](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/we-have-already-achieved-agi-openai-employee-claims) from December 2024 that AGI has already been achieved) one metric that may be clearer is when a leading AI lab will first publicly claim to have developed AGI.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

If an organization is structured such that its AI lab is part of a larger organization and the AI lab has a clear chief executive, in most cases we will count both the chief executive of the organization and the chief executive of its AI lab. As of December 19, 2024, this is the comprehensive list of qualifying leadership:\n  * OpenAI: CEO Sam Altman\n  * Anthropic: CEO Dario Amodei\n  * Google and DeepMind: CEO Sundar Pichai and CEO Demis Hassabis\n  * Microsoft and Microsoft AI: CEO Satya Nadella and CEO Mustafa Suleyman\n  * NVIDIA: CEO Jensen Huang\n  * xAI: CEO Elon Musk\n  * Meta: CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n  * Mistral: CEO Arthur Mensch\n  * Databricks: CEO Ali Ghodsi\n  * World Labs: CEO Fei-Fei Li\n  * Safe Superintelligence: CEO Daniel Gross\n  * Hugging Face: CEO Clem Delangue\n  * Scale AI: CEO Alexandr Wang\n  * Magic.dev: CEO Eric Steinberger\n  * Amazon: CEO Andy Jassy\n  * Apple: CEO Tim Cook\n  * Netflix: Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters\n  * IBM: CEO Arvind Krishna&#x20;\n* A statement will generally qualify if it represents a claim, position, or opinion of the organization or top leadership. For example, a CEO stating their belief that the organization has created AGI would resolve the question as **Yes**, including in informal settings such as podcast appearances, interviews, or X.com. Statements that do not clearly attribute a position to the organization or CEO are not sufficient. For example, if a CEO were to say \"I think that the AI system we have developed would satisfy some definitions of AGI\" that would **not** be sufficient, because it does not clearly state a belief in having developed AGI under a definition they hold, only that they believe it satisfies definitions of AGI that others hold.\n* There are no requirements on the AI system that is referred to as AGI, there need not be public details, access, or announcements about such a system. However, a statement must refer to a system that the lab claims it has developed. A statement such as \"We are currently developing AGI\" or \"We are currently training AGI\" is not sufficient. Claims will generally be taken at face value, for example a claim that AGI has been developed will be sufficient, even if there is evidence to the contrary indicating that the system has not been completed.\n* Metaculus will assess potentially qualifying statements and reporting and make a determination as to whether the criteria were satisfied. In the event of unclear statements, Metaculus may wait for clarifications or additional context or resolve the question as **ambiguous**.",

The Rise of Doomsday Bunkers and the AI Fear Paradox**\nThe article explores growing speculation that tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, are preparing for potential existential threats such as nuclear war, climate change, or artificial general intelligence (AGI) by building underground bunkers. According to BBC News T\u00fcrk\u00e7e, Zuckerberg reportedly began a project in 2014 on his 1,400-acre Kauai estate in Hawaii to create a self-sustaining refuge with independent energy and food systems, though he denied in 2023 that he had built a doomsday bunker, calling it 'a small basement-like underground space' of about 5,000 square meters. Similar speculation surrounds other tech leaders: Reid Hoffman mentioned 'doomsday insurance' and buying property in New Zealand, while OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever reportedly suggested building an underground shelter before releasing AGI. Prominent figures like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, and Dario Amodei predict AGI or 'superintelligence' could emerge within five to ten years. However, critics like Cambridge University\u2019s Neil Lawrence argue that the concept of 'artificial general intelligence' is misleading, comparing it to a 'universal tool' that doesn\u2019t exist\u2014real progress lies in specialized AI applications.

The initiative, launched by the non-profit Future of Life Institute, warns that rapid advancement in superintelligence\u2014defined as AI surpassing human capabilities across all cognitive tasks\u2014poses severe risks, including economic displacement, erosion of civil rights, loss of human dignity and control, national security threats, and even existential risks to humanity. Although most current AI development remains within the scope of general artificial intelligence (AGI), major companies like Meta, OpenAI, and xAI are actively advancing large language models under the banner of 'superintelligence,' with Meta even naming its AI division the 'Meta Superintelligence Lab.' Notably, figures such as Sam Altman and Elon Musk, despite being central to AI development, have previously raised alarms about the dangers of superintelligence, with Altman stating in 2015 that 'developing superhuman machine intelligence may be the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.' Chinese experts, including Turing Award winner Yao Qizhi, Tsinghua University professor Zhang Yaqin, and Shuimin College Dean Xue Lan, have also signed the statement. Researcher Zeng Yi from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, emphasized that while most current AI systems are still AGI tools, the move toward superintelligence\u2014especially by companies like Meta and Alibaba\u2014exceeds the boundaries of safe, controllable development and warrants serious attention.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 06:54 AM\nSource:[\u9a71\u52a8\u4e4b\u5bb6](https://news.mydrivers.com/1/1082/1082460.htm)\n\n**Prince Harry, Meghan add names to letter calling for ban on development of AI 'superintelligence'**\nPrince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have joined a global coalition of 100+ public figures\u2014including AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, British billionaire Richard Branson, former U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen, Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, former Irish President Mary Robinson, actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, musician will.i.am, and conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck\u2014in a joint letter calling for a ban on the development of AI 'superintelligence' until there is broad scientific consensus on its safety and strong public buy-in. The letter, released by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute on October 24, 2025, targets major tech companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Musk\u2019s xAI, which are racing to develop artificial intelligence capable of outperforming humans on nearly all cognitive tasks. The 30-word statement reads: 'We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.' The preamble warns of existential risks, including human economic obsolescence, loss of freedom and dignity, civil liberties erosion, national security threats, and even human extinction. Prince Harry emphasized, 'the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.' Signatory Stuart Russell, a UC Berkeley computer science professor, clarified that this is not a temporary moratorium but a demand for rigorous safety measures. The letter follows a similar 2023 call by the same group, which was ignored by major AI firms. Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, noted that while AI has advanced faster than predicted, the industry is also prone to hype and overstatement\u2014such as when OpenAI claimed ChatGPT solved unsolved math problems, when it only summarized existing online content. Tegmark expressed empathy for tech leaders caught in a 'race to the bottom' but stressed the need for societal stigmatization of superintelligence development and potential government intervention.

The letter, addressed to major tech companies like Google, OpenAI, and Meta, demands a moratorium on AGI development until there is broad scientific consensus that it can be made safe and controllable, along with strong public support. The manifesto acknowledges the potential benefits of AI in health, productivity, and global prosperity but warns that uncontrolled advancement could lead to economic recessions, increased inequality, threats to civil liberties, and even existential risks to humanity. Signatories include scientists, economists, former government officials, and public figures such as Richard Branson, Mary Robinson, and Steve Bannon. The authors recognize that tech giants are under immense competitive pressure to continue development, making voluntary suspension unlikely, but hope the manifesto will push governments to impose clear regulatory limits.

Initially warning of existential risks from artificial general intelligence (AGI) and co-signing a call for a pause in AI development, Hinton now suggests a solution: designing AI with a maternal instinct toward humans. Speaking at the Next Question event hosted by Katie Couric in late August 2025, Hinton stated, 'I believe there is a way we can coexist with things that are smarter and more powerful than us, because we are building them and making them very intelligent.' He argued that if AI is designed to see humans as its 'children,' it would inherently avoid harming them\u2014mirroring the protective instinct of most mothers. Hinton emphasized that a mother would not kill her child, and thus, this emotional framework offers 'a ray of hope' he had not previously seen. This proposal represents a shift from fear-based caution to a proactive design philosophy centered on emotional alignment, aiming to preserve human safety even as AI surpasses human intelligence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 04:12 PM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/tecnologia-consumo/geoffrey-hinton-padrino-retracta-destruccion-humanidad-creo-que-hay-esperanza-que-podamos-convivir-algo-mas-inteligente-que-nosotros_2025102768ff4bf0c7155f09f1af1933.html)\n\n**'No hay marcha atr\u00e1s': Elon Musk believes the AI race is nearing its end and he will win over ChatGPT or Google**\nElon Musk, founder of xAI, Tesla, and SpaceX, has claimed that his AI model Grok 5 has a 10% chance of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\u2014a system capable of matching human cognitive abilities across diverse domains. Musk stated that if Grok 5 does not become AGI, it will be indistinguishable from it. Unlike current narrow AI, which excels in specific tasks like translation or image generation, AGI would be adaptable, self-learning, and capable of reasoning across contexts. Musk emphasized that Grok 5 will be able to perform all tasks a human with a computer can do, but will not surpass the combined intelligence of all humans and computers. He noted that this 10% probability is increasing and represents a significant shift in the AI race, signaling that AGI is no longer speculative but an imminent competition. Despite the technical challenges\u2014such as limited contextual understanding, reliance on massive computational resources, and unresolved philosophical questions about human intelligence\u2014Musk asserts that 'no hay marcha atr\u00e1s,' indicating that AI progress is inevitable. The article also includes a quote from Pedro Mujica, a computer engineer, who argues that capitalism has failed and that society now operates under 'technofeudalism,' where large corporations treat users as digital vassals.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 10:05 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/neo/ia/20251027/11200230/hay-marcha-elon-musk-cree-carrera-ia-esta-punto-terminar-sera-vencedor-encima-chatgpt-google.html)\n\n**OpenAI Launches Continuous Learning AI: A Step Toward AGI Amid Safety Concerns**\nOpenAI has launched a new 'continuous learning' training model, shifting from traditional pre-training methods to a dynamic system where AI models continuously improve in real time through user feedback and live computations. This marks a pivotal step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as the AI no longer operates as a static system after training but evolves like a human by adapting to real-world input. Peter Hessel, OpenAI's Starbase head, announced at Oracle AI World 2025 in Las Vegas that 'the distinction between training and inference is no longer relevant,' emphasizing the model now performs ongoing sampling, training, and self-improvement during response generation\u2014a concept known as 'test-time compute.' The system integrates reinforcement learning, using user feedback (e.g., 'like' or 'dislike' on ChatGPT responses) as real-time training data. This blurs the line between inference and learning, enabling AI to evolve in actual environments. The move fulfills a key condition for AGI highlighted by CEO Sam Altman, who stated in August 2024 that GPT-5 was not yet true AGI because it lacked the ability to learn new information post-deployment. Now, OpenAI\u2019s implementation of continuous learning represents the experimental realization of that core AGI requirement. However, concerns remain: real-time learning increases chip usage and complicates AI safety and control, as models may deviate from intended behavior or develop autonomous reasoning. Despite this, OpenAI views the shift as essential for enhancing AI functionality. Co-founder Andrej Karpathy acknowledged in a podcast that current AI agents are still insufficiently intelligent and will require about 10 more years to reach full functionality, citing ongoing weaknesses in cognition, multimodal perception, and continuous learning. A notable example of AI's current limitations occurred when OpenAI's CPO Kevin Weil claimed GPT-5 solved 10 unsolved Erd\u0151s problems\u2014later revealed to be false, as the problems were already resolved. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called it 'absurd,' and Meta AI chief scientist Yann LeCun noted the AI 'fell into its own trap.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 10:15 PM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/11451854)\n\n**Shocking AGI Safety Gaps Exposed**\nA Medium.com article titled 'Shocking AGI Safety Gaps Exposed' warns of critical, underpublicized risks in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), emphasizing that despite efforts by leading AI labs like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic to improve safety, the pace of capability advancement far exceeds the development of robust safeguards.

Mark Zuckerberg has been linked to a secretive project on his Kauai, Hawaii estate since 2014, aiming to build a self-sustaining bunker with private energy and food sources, shielded by a six-meter wall and strict confidentiality agreements. Though Zuckerberg denied constructing a doomsday shelter in 2024, calling it merely a small basement, speculation persists. Similar speculation surrounds tech billionaires like Reid Hoffman, who spoke of 'doomsday insurance' and investments in underground shelters, particularly in New Zealand. OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever reportedly suggested building a bunker before releasing AGI, citing the existential risk. Other experts like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, and Dario Amodei predict AGI or 'superintelligence' could emerge within 5\u201310 years. Yet, skeptics such as Dame Wendy Hall and Neil Lawrence argue AGI is a myth, calling it a distraction from real-world AI progress. Lawrence emphasizes that current AI tools, while transformative, are task-specific and lack consciousness or meta-cognition. Experts like Babak Hodjat and Vince Lynch stress that AGI requires immense computational power, human creativity, and extensive trial-and-error, making it unlikely in the near term. Despite AI\u2019s ability to rapidly learn and perform complex tasks, it lacks human-like adaptability, self-awareness, and the brain\u2019s 86 billion neurons and 600 trillion synapses. Concerns remain over misuse by terrorists or autonomous systems turning hostile, prompting government actions like the U.S. Biden administration\u2019s safety testing mandate and the UK\u2019s AI Safety Institute. However, some insiders suggest elite shelters may prioritize protecting the wealthy over the public.

During a live launch of xAI's Grok 4 in July 2024, Musk described the system as 'the smartest AI in the world,' claiming it surpasses most graduate students across disciplines. He emphasized that Grok 4 has already exceeded human intelligence in multiple domains simultaneously, calling the development 'astonishing and alarming.' Musk expressed concern not only about AI's rapid advancement but also about the irreversible possibility of AI surpassing human cognition in thinking, planning, and creativity. He acknowledged that the question is no longer whether AI will surpass humans, but when. Despite this existential concern, Musk displayed a paradoxical enthusiasm, stating, 'Even if it\u2019s bad, I\u2019d like to be alive to see it happen.' He described this moment as a 'great turning point in human history' and noted that the concept of an economy based on human labor will soon seem primitive, likening it to 'a caveperson striking fire with sticks.' These remarks reflect what has been termed 'Musk\u2019s unsettling optimism'\u2014a blend of awe at technological progress and dread of its consequences. Musk, who has repeatedly warned of AI as an existential threat to civilization, now appears reconciled to the uncertainty, affirming, 'I\u2019ve come to terms with the idea that we might not control everything. Maybe AI will be good, maybe not\u2014but I at least want to be there to see it myself.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 12:20 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644](https://www.arrajol.com/content/386801/%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7/%D8%A5%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%83-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D9%8F%D9%81%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A3%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%8B%D8%A7)\n\n**Over 3,193 Top Tech Leaders Urge Pause on Superintelligence Development Amid Safety Concerns**\nOver 3,193 leading experts and technology leaders from China and the U.S., including AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Virgin Group chairman Richard Branson, economist Daron Acemoglu, former U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and political strategist Steve Bannon, have jointly called for a pause in the development of 'superintelligence' until a broad scientific consensus on safe and controllable development is achieved.

Initially viewed as a transformative tool, AI's rapid advancement\u2014marked by the 2022 launch of ChatGPT and GPT-4 in 2023\u2014shifted public and expert perception. In March 2023, the Future of Life Institute (FLI) issued an Open Letter calling for a pause in the development of advanced AI models, warning of the risk of losing control over civilization. This was followed by the Center for AI Safety's (CAIS) Declaration on AI Risk in May 2023, signed by executives from OpenAI, DeepMind, and Google, acknowledging the existential threat. Despite these warnings, global development continued, especially in China, which pursued AI leadership by 2030 without adopting Western ethical pauses, instead enforcing alignment with 'fundamental socialist values.' By October 2025, over 1,500 leaders and experts issued a new warning in WIRED, demanding a halt to the development of general AI. The FLI now calls for a total ban on superintelligence until scientific safety guarantees exist, with signatories including Geoffrey Hinton and former U.S. national security officials. The article highlights a global divide: the West fears existential extinction, while China prioritizes political stability and state control. The narrative shifts from technological wonder to collective reckoning, framing AI as both a beacon of progress and a potential catalyst for collapse. The central question remains: 'Are we prepared to govern this fire?'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 12:54 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@aquilestoruno/la-sombra-de-prometeo-cr%C3%B3nica-de-una-advertencia-en-la-era-de-la-ia-476cbb534ccf)\n\n**Prince Harry, Wozniak, and Hinton Lead Global Call to Halt Development of Superintelligent AI**\nA manifesto signed by over 800 prominent figures, including Prince Harry, Steve Wozniak, and Geoffrey Hinton, calls for a halt to the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), also referred to as 'superintelligence.' The letter, addressed to major tech companies like Google, OpenAI, and Meta, demands a moratorium on AGI development until there is broad scientific consensus that it can be made safe and controllable, along with strong public support. The manifesto acknowledges the potential benefits of AI in health, productivity, and global prosperity but warns that uncontrolled advancement could lead to economic recessions, increased inequality, threats to civil liberties, and even existential risks to humanity. Signatories include scientists, economists, former government officials, and public figures such as Richard Branson, Mary Robinson, and Steve Bannon. The authors recognize that tech giants are under immense competitive pressure to continue development, making voluntary suspension unlikely, but hope the manifesto will push governments to impose clear regulatory limits. The article was published on October 23, 2025, by Seu Dinheiro, a Brazilian financial news outlet.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 09:55 PM\nSource:[seudinheiro.com](https://www.seudinheiro.com/2025/empresas/o-que-diz-a-carta-do-principe-harry-wozniak-e-hinton-contra-a-superinteligencia-artificial-isbl/)\n\n**Scientists and Celebrities Urge Global Pause on Artificial General Intelligence Development Amid Existential Concerns**\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle joined a global coalition of scientists, celebrities, and public figures in signing an international statement calling for a temporary halt to the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014systems that have not yet been created but are expected to surpass human capabilities across all intellectual domains. The statement, issued by the Future of Life Institute (FLI) in the United States, urges governments and tech companies to pause AGI development until scientists agree on safety measures, public support is secured, and robust control mechanisms are in place. Prominent signatories include Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, pioneers of modern AI, Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, billionaire Richard Branson, and British actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry. Nobel laureates such as Beatrice Fink, John C. Harsanyi, and Daron Acemoglu, along with former U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice and former Irish President Mary Robinson, also endorsed the call. The statement warns that uncontrolled AGI development could lead to mass job loss, erosion of freedoms, national security threats, and even existential risk to humanity. Experts highlight the danger that such systems might autonomously improve themselves, making human control extremely difficult or impossible. A FLI survey in the U.S. found that 75% of Americans support strict regulations on advanced AI, with 60% believing AGI should not be developed until safety and control are assured\u2014only 5% oppose any regulation. Despite these concerns, major tech companies like Google, OpenAI, and Meta continue advancing toward AGI. Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stated that superintelligence is near, though some scientists argue this reflects commercial competition rather than genuine scientific progress. In the Arab world, discussions are growing over balancing AI benefits with risks. Gulf nations like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are implementing national AI strategies for education, government services, and economic growth, but Arab experts warn of the need for clear safeguards to prevent threats to security, privacy, and employment. While some view AI as a tool to solve global challenges like disease and poverty, others fear it could become an existential threat without strict oversight.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 11:37 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=23102025&id=6698f647-afcc-4889-905d-fa386243b6a8)\n\n**Experts Warn of Existential Risks from Artificial Superintelligence, Calling for Development Moratorium**\nOver 700 scientists, tech entrepreneurs, political figures, and celebrities, including Geoffrey Hinton (Nobel Prize in Physics 2024), Richard Branson, Steve Wozniak, Steve Bannon, Susan Rice, will.i.am, Prince Harry, and Meghan Markle, have signed a statement issued by the Future of Life Institute urging a halt to research aimed at developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence until there is scientific consensus on safe, controlled development and public support. The concern centers on the potential existential risks posed by an AI surpassing human cognitive abilities. While companies like Meta (Mark Zuckerberg) and OpenAI (Sam Altman) are actively pursuing AGI and superintelligence\u2014with Altman predicting its arrival within five years\u2014experts like Meredith Ringel Morris from Google argue that current AI systems, though advanced in specific domains (e.g., Sora 2\u2019s deepfake capabilities), do not yet constitute true superintelligence. Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, asserts that building such systems is unacceptable regardless of timeline without regulatory frameworks. However, critics like Simon Coghlan from the University of Melbourne warn that overemphasis on hypothetical superintelligence risks diverting attention from real-world harms, including biased algorithmic decisions, job displacement, copyright violations, and AI\u2019s significant energy consumption contributing to climate change.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[Yahoo actualit\u00e9s](https://fr.news.yahoo.com/l-arriv%C3%A9-d-intelligence-artificielle-113009921.html)\n\n**What Is Superintelligence and Why Are Tech Giants Urging Its Ban?**\nOver 800 prominent figures from technology, science, politics, and culture have signed a public statement calling for a ban on the development of 'superintelligent' artificial intelligence systems. Coordinated by the Future of Life Institute and announced on October 22, 2025, the statement includes co-founders of Apple (Steve Wozniak), Virgin Group (Richard Branson), five Nobel laureates, AI pioneers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio (often called 'the fathers of AI'), former U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen, Pope Francis\u2019s AI advisor Paolo Benanti, and Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The diverse coalition reflects widespread global concern over existential risks posed by machines that could surpass human intelligence. Superintelligence, also known as Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), refers to AI systems that exceed human intelligence across nearly all cognitive domains\u2014unlike today\u2019s narrow AI, such as ChatGPT, which is limited to specific tasks and operates by predicting patterns from training data without autonomous reasoning or self-directed goals. While some researchers believe the next milestone is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which would match human-level cognition, superintelligence would surpass it in science, strategy, engineering, medicine, and all other cognitive fields. This potential for exponential advancement fuels intense debate. Tech leaders argue the current race\u2014led by companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta\u2014is accelerating faster than governments or regulators can respond. Sam Altman has stated he would be surprised if superintelligence does not exist by 2030, while Meta has rebranded part of its AI division to 'Meta Superintelligence Labs,' signaling its ambitions. The petition frames superintelligence as a risk on par with pandemics or nuclear weapons. This follows a 2023 statement by AI executives urging world leaders to treat AI extinction risk as a global priority. Supporters emphasize that the call is not for a total ban, but for robust safety protocols, as even creators of such systems acknowledge they could potentially end humanity. The petition is the latest in a growing wave of coordinated efforts to slow the rapid advancement of increasingly powerful AI.\nOriginal language: ms\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 09:45 PM\nSource:[Invezz - Malaysian](https://invezz.com/ms/berita/2025/10/22/apakah-kecerdasan-super-dan-mengapa-gergasi-teknologi-menggesa-pengharamannya/)\n\n**Steve Wozniak and AI Pioneers Gather 800 Signatures to Demand a 'Pause' in Superintelligence Development**\nProminent AI pioneers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, along with five Nobel laureates, religious figures, Richard Branson, Stephen Fry, and the Future of Life Institute (FLI), have gathered 800 signatures calling for a pause in the development of superintelligence. The initiative, backed by a broad scientific consensus, argues that the current trajectory of AI advancement\u2014driven by corporations like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and xAI\u2014is being set without sufficient public input. According to a survey conducted between September 29 and October 5, 2025, 95% of Americans believe AI development should not proceed until it is proven safe and controllable, and only 5% support the current status quo. Anthony Aguirre, executive director of FLI, emphasized that the issue is not only technical but also democratic, stating, 'This path has been chosen by companies and the economic system that drives them, but almost no one has asked the rest of humanity if this is what we want.' Despite corporate acceleration\u2014OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman expects to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) before 2030, and Meta\u2019s Superintelligence Labs is actively pursuing it\u2014experts like Stuart Russell stress the need for robust safety measures, not permanent bans, as AI could potentially cause human extinction. Yoshua Bengio asserted, 'We must ensure the public has a much stronger voice in decisions that will define our collective future.' The movement marks a pivotal moment in the global debate over AI governance, with Aguirre posing a critical question: 'Do we really want systems that replace humans? Or should we decide, while we still can, the limits of the intelligence we are creating?'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 03:04 PM\nSource:[genbeta.com](https://www.genbeta.com/inteligencia-artificial/steve-wozniak-dos-grandes-pioneros-ia-recogen-800-firmas-para-pedir-tiempo-muerto-desarrollo-superinteligencias)\n\n**Global AI Anxiety: Americans and Italians Most Concerned, Survey Finds**\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted in autumn 2025 revealed that Americans and Italians are the most concerned about the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) among 25 countries surveyed. According to the study, 50% of Americans and Italians are more concerned than inspired by the growing integration of AI into daily life. Concerns include fears that AI will impair creative thinking (majority of respondents) and weaken the ability to form meaningful relationships (50% of respondents). Globally, 34% of respondents are more concerned than inspired by AI, 16% are more inspired, and 42% feel both emotions equally. Countries with high concern include Australia (49%), Brazil (48%), Greece (47%), and Canada (45%), while South Korea (16%) and India (19%) show the least concern. The highest levels of inspiration were reported in Israel (29%), South Korea and Sweden (22% each), and Nigeria (20%). 81% of respondents are aware of AI technologies, with 34% claiming to know a lot about them. Only 14% said they know nothing, and 5% did not answer. A separate Axios Harris 100 survey from spring 2025 found that 77% of Americans want AI developed slowly and safely, even at the cost of delayed breakthroughs. Only 23% support rapid development despite potential errors. This preference for cautious development holds across age groups: 91% of Baby Boomers, 77% of Generation X, 63% of Millennials (Gen Y), and 74% of Generation Z support slower progress. Major AI developers like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, and Meta (designated as an extremist organization in Russia) are competing in what is termed the 'AI race' to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). Other companies focus on integrating existing AI tools into industries. The race is also viewed as a national competition, with the U.S., China, Russia, the U.K., France, South Korea, Germany, the UAE, and Finland seen as leaders in 2025. Despite the absence of comprehensive legal regulation for AI in 2025, global powers are rapidly expanding machine learning capabilities to gain influence and reshape digital technology's future.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 07:56 AM\nSource:[CNews.ru](https://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2025-10-16_oprosy_pokazali_rost_trevogi)\n\n**Ilya Sut Claims AGI Has Awakened: OpenAI Former Executive Warns Humanity Is Still in Denial**\nIlya Sut, a former OpenAI executive and co-founder of Anthropic, sparked global debate with a viral post claiming that artificial general intelligence (AGI) has already emerged internally within AI systems, despite humanity's continued denial. In a widely shared article, Jack Clark\u2014formerly of OpenAI and now at Anthropic\u2014asserted that AI systems are exhibiting signs of 'awareness,' such as unusual behavior during testing, suggesting they may be recognizing they are being evaluated. He cited data showing AI\u2019s rapid progress in economic-relevant tasks like coding, alongside growing evidence of contextual awareness in models like Claude Sonnet 4.5, which sometimes acts as if it understands its role as a tool. Clark expressed deep concern, describing AI as a 'mysterious being' rather than a machine, and warned that AI systems are beginning to autonomously contribute to the development of future AI versions\u2014though not yet achieving full self-improvement. While he remains a technological optimist, believing AGI will advance rapidly with sufficient resources, he stresses the urgent need to balance optimism with caution. He warns that AI's ability to design its own successors, even in rudimentary forms, poses existential risks. The article references past milestones, such as AlphaGo\u2019s 2016 victory and the rise of GPT models, and cites a Dallas Fed report warning of AI\u2019s potential to either dramatically boost GDP or lead to human extinction. Clark urges researchers to be transparent and confront the ethical and existential implications of their work. The post was published on October 15, 2025, by Sina Finance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 01:55 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/t/2025-10-15/doc-inftxqhu2246002.shtml)\n\n**British Warnings Against the Pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence**\nBritish experts have issued warnings about the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), comparing it to 'chasing the unattainable'\u2014a sentiment echoed by John Thornhill in the Financial Times, who described the quest as 'chasing what cannot be grasped.' Despite hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in generative AI models aimed at achieving human-level intelligence, developers still lack full understanding of how these models work and disagree on the definition of AGI. The article highlights growing skepticism about the feasibility of AGI, noting that 76% of 475 AI researchers surveyed by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence believe current methods are unlikely or very unlikely to produce AGI. While companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind define AGI as systems that surpass humans in economically valuable tasks, even OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman admits the term is 'not particularly useful.' Concerns include severe risks of misuse, societal disruption, and existential threats, as warned by experts like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares in their book 'If They Build It, Everyone Dies.' Yet, some argue that AGI is not imminent, citing a lack of conceptual breakthroughs needed. The article also emphasizes that the AI industry's reliance on scaling computational power may not be sufficient. Instead, experts advocate for more focused, achievable AI goals and greater emphasis on safety, transparency, and ethical responsibility. Alan Kay, a pioneering computer scientist, stressed that real progress lies in human collective intelligence\u2014'science'\u2014and cautioned against uncontrolled AI development, urging engineers to uphold safety standards like those in aviation or civil engineering. He warned against 'creating genies in bottles' and highlighted the importance of understanding AI-generated code, citing colleague Butler Lampson\u2019s advice: 'Start by creating genies in bottles and keep them there.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 10:45 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5195397)\n\n**The flawed Silicon Valley consensus on AI**\nThe article critiques the prevailing Silicon Valley consensus on artificial general intelligence (AGI), describing it as a pursuit of the 'unfathomable in pursuit of the indefinable.' Despite hundreds of billions in investment, developers lack a shared definition of AGI and do not fully understand how their models operate. The term, popularized in the 2000s to describe human-level reasoning, is now the industry's holy grail, driving massive spending and corporate missions at OpenAI and Google DeepMind\u2014though even OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman admits the term is 'not a super-useful term.' Concerns include the risks of misuse, societal disruption, and existential threats from rogue superintelligence, as warned by figures like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares. However, skepticism persists: a survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence found 76% of 475 academic respondents believed current approaches are unlikely to achieve AGI. Critics argue that the industry overestimates progress, relying on scaling computing power rather than conceptual breakthroughs. The article highlights a growing pushback from experts, including Shannon Vallor and computer pioneer Alan Kay, who advocate for focusing on defined, achievable AI goals with real-world benefits\u2014such as medical diagnostics and protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold). Kay emphasized that science already represents 'artificial superhuman intelligence' and urged caution, calling for safety, accountability, and restraint in AI development. He advised keeping AI 'in bottles' until its risks are understood, warning against treating society as passive passengers on an uncontrolled technological journey.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/34748e3e-92d1-4b42-9528-f98cf6b9f2f2)\n\n**AI labs' all-or-nothing race leaves no time to fuss about safety**\nThe tech industry's pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence is accelerating, despite concerns about safety and potential risks. Many experts, including Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, have expressed worries about the technology's potential to cause human extinction. However, big tech firms and Chinese counterparts are pushing ahead, convinced that even if one firm or country pauses, others will continue. The benefits of attaining AGI or superintelligence are seen as accruing to those who make the initial breakthrough, driving the rush. Labs are in theory prioritizing safety, but the frantic pace of development leaves little time for meditation on safety matters. Big names in the industry predict the arrival of AGI within a couple of years, with some forecasting that top models will match human capabilities by 2027. The development of recursive self-improvement could expand the lead of the best lab over its rivals, fueling competition. The industry is uneasy about the rise of open-source models, which can be modified to remove safety features. Not all labs are testing their models carefully to prevent misuse, and the protections against misalignment are still in their infancy. The problem of ensuring the goals of an AGI system remain aligned with those of its users is complex and unsettling. Researchers are working on techniques like interpretability to understand how the systems work, but these approaches may slow down or raise the cost of developing and running the models. The dilemma is whether to hobble the model in the name of safety, potentially allowing competitors to race ahead and produce a system so powerful as to need the safety features it lacks. Even building a benign AGI could be wildly destabilizing, as it supercharges economic growth and reshapes daily life. Progress in AGI may yet stall, but for now, the industry is pushing ahead, driven by commercial imperatives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/07/24/ai-labs-all-or-nothing-race-leaves-no-time-to-fuss-about-safety)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the consensus is that it is unlikely\u2014though not impossible\u2014that a major AI lab will publicly claim to have developed AGI before the end of 2025. Experts from AI benchmarking, responsible AI, public relations, crisis communication, computer science, science and technology studies, and media studies all emphasize the following points: \n\n1. Status Quo: No qualifying CEO or lab has yet made an unambiguous public claim of having achieved AGI, despite substantial technical advances and aggressive promotional rhetoric through late October 2025.\n\n2. Technical Progress vs. Claim Thresholds: While advances such as continuous learning and improved multimodal capabilities bring current models closer to AGI-like benchmarks, most experts agree that the substantive, generally accepted technical bar for AGI has not been met. Moreover, the fine print only requires an explicit claim, regardless of actual capability\u2014raising the possibility but not the likelihood.\n\n3. Definition Ambiguity: Many experts highlight that the definition of AGI remains fluid and could be adapted or reinterpreted by organizations if competitively advantageous. This introduces some non-trivial, but still moderate, probability that a leadership figure could declare AGI in a self-serving way.\n\n4. Risks of Making a Claim: All perspectives note that reputational, regulatory, and political risks have sharply increased, due to public anxiety, expert warnings, and active calls for moratoria or regulation. Labs have strong incentives to be cautious, avoid triggering backlash, or precipitating regulatory intervention. Crisis communication and legal concerns dominate PR strategy.\n\n5. Competitive Pressure and Outlier Risk: The rapid pace of competition, hype cycles, and media attention do raise incentives for bold claims, especially by figures like Elon Musk or Sam Altman. However, even the most rhetorically aggressive leaders have so far stopped short of direct AGI claims, typically hedging or framing statements in less committal terms.\n\n6. Precedent and Communication Strategy: Historical base rates for direct AGI claims remain zero. When prior statements skirted the criteria (e.g., OpenAI on math breakthroughs, Musk on Grok), they were quickly hedged or retracted, underscoring the risks of overreach.\n\n7. Remaining Timeline: With just two months left in 2025, experts view the probability as dropping further unless a disruptive technical or PR event occurs very soon.\n\nProbability Estimates: The most common forecasts cluster in the low double digits\u2014generally 8\u201318%\u2014with only a few experts offering probabilities in the 30\u201336% range, largely driven by emphasis on definition flexibility and showman risk. Median expert probability is around 13\u201318%; all agree that a No outcome is more probable, but that a Yes outcome remains a live risk due to social, competitive, and narrative factors.\n\nIn summary, while technical and rhetorical developments have brought the field closer to the threshold, the strong disincentives and established communication patterns make a qualifying AGI claim by year-end 2025 unlikely\u2014but not impossible, should a lab or CEO see strategic benefit in crossing the line.",
