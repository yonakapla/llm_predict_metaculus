Altman's case has had neither: the scandals are managerial and reputational, not criminal, and regulatory overseers have repeatedly combed through the relevant transitions. While you rightly admit a slender background rate for something truly unpredictable, this is the only rational approach. The hand-waving about asset transfer or political risk from other forecasters collapses under the weight of clear legal precedent: the U.S. system gives plenty of warning before pulling the criminal trigger on someone this high-profile.

However, critiques of my original argument and of analogous elite-protection views reminded me not to overestimate the durability of elite coalitions or underestimate rapid shifts: the protection afforded by interest groups and aligned elites can dissolve quickly if a scandal or credible criminal evidence emerges, especially in the face of political or populist pressure. While this reminds me to avoid excessive structural complacency, there is still no visible trigger or smoke for criminal referral, and the timeline is short.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, made the announcement during a live stream on October 29, 2025. This declaration coincided with OpenAI's transition from a non-profit organization to a public benefit corporation, which removes previous governance constraints and enables greater capital investment. Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's Chief Scientist, clarified that a 'full AI researcher' would be capable of autonomously executing large-scale research projects. He added that, according to OpenAI's assessment, superintelligent systems surpassing human intelligence across a broad range of critical tasks could be developed through deep learning in less than a decade. To achieve these goals, OpenAI will focus on two key areas: continuous algorithmic improvements and a radical increase in computational resources during the inference phase\u2014the time models spend deliberating on tasks. Currently, AI models can operate within approximately five hours to produce results comparable to human performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad. However, Pachocki emphasized that these limits will expand rapidly through significantly greater computational power. OpenAI plans to use AI to accelerate scientific research in medicine, physics, and technology to achieve discoveries faster and solve more complex problems. As part of the restructuring, the non-profit OpenAI Foundation will receive 26% of the commercial entity\u2019s shares and will set research priorities.

The transformation, which culminated on October 28, 2025, involved restructuring into a capped-profit entity where the nonprofit foundation retains approximately 26%, Microsoft holds 27%, and employees and investors own the remaining 47%. This move followed internal and external controversies, including the brief dismissal of CEO Sam Altman on November 17, 2023, over claims of 'lack of transparency,' which lasted only five days due to strong support from Microsoft and staff. Altman\u2019s return in November 2023 coincided with the company\u2019s decisive pivot toward commercialization. The reorganization faced resistance from former employees, AI safety experts, academic institutions, and public authorities\u2014particularly the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who initially questioned the transfer of nonprofit assets and demanded legal safeguards. Both states eventually approved the restructuring after OpenAI implemented governance and safety commitments. Elon Musk, a co-founder who left in 2019, has been a vocal critic, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission and colluding with Microsoft. Musk even made a $97.4 billion acquisition offer in February 2025 to return OpenAI to open-source and safety-focused principles, which was rejected. The new agreement also solidifies OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft, granting Microsoft guaranteed access to OpenAI\u2019s models until 2023 while allowing both companies to develop their own AGI technologies.

In a pivotal move, OpenAI announced plans to restructure its for-profit arm into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), valued at $500 billion, with Microsoft retaining a $135 billion stake (approximately 27%) and the OpenAI Foundation, a nonprofit, retaining control. This shift follows a turbulent period including the abrupt firing of CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman in November 2023, which triggered mass staff threats to quit and join Microsoft. Altman was reinstated on November 21, 2023, after a board shake-up, and later returned to the board in March 2024. The company has since faced legal challenges, including a lawsuit from The New York Times (December 27, 2023) and a separate suit from Musk (March 1, 2024), who later dismissed his case but revived it in August 2024. In 2024, OpenAI saw leadership departures, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever and top technical leaders like CTO Mira Murati. The company raised $6.6 billion in October 2024, valuing it at $157 billion. In early 2025, OpenAI formed a joint venture with SoftBank and Oracle to build up to $500 billion in AI data centers in the U.S., with SoftBank committing $19 billion and OpenAI also pledging $19 billion. A consortium led by Musk offered $97.4 billion to acquire OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit parent in February 2025.

Under the new agreement, OpenAI will purchase $250 billion in Azure cloud services from Microsoft, though Microsoft no longer holds first refusal rights as OpenAI's compute provider. Microsoft's intellectual property rights for OpenAI's models and products are extended through 2032. The deal, approved by regulators, marks a shift toward greater independence for OpenAI, allowing it to develop products with third parties and deploy services on competing cloud platforms. This restructuring follows governance tensions in November 2023 when OpenAI's board briefly fired CEO Sam Altman, leading to an employee revolt and Microsoft's intervention. The new framework aims to stabilize OpenAI\u2019s governance, attract new investors, and support its mission of using generative AI to cure diseases and maximize societal benefits while minimizing risks. Microsoft retains the ability to pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI) development independently or with other partners. The partnership began in 2019 with a $1 billion investment and was deepened in 2021 and January 2023 with a $10 billion investment following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022.

This timeline follows OpenAI's transition to a public benefit corporation, which lifts constraints from its original non-profit charter and enables greater capital raising. Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's chief scientist, described the 'legitimate AI researcher' as a system capable of autonomously delivering on large-scale research projects. He stated that deep learning systems could achieve superintelligence\u2014defined as systems surpassing human capabilities across critical domains\u2014within less than a decade. To reach these goals, OpenAI is focusing on algorithmic innovation and significantly increasing 'test time compute,' allowing models to spend more computational time solving complex problems. Pachocki noted that current models already match top human performance in competitions like the International Mathematics Olympiad and operate with a five-hour time horizon, but future breakthroughs may require dedicating entire data centers' worth of computing power to single problems. The restructuring establishes the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, which will own 26% of the for-profit entity and govern research direction. The foundation has a $25 billion commitment to use AI for curing diseases and managing AI safety.

Her leadership helped scale OpenAI from a research lab to a global AI leader. In November 2023, she briefly served as interim CEO following Sam Altman\u2019s removal, a role that brought her widespread public attention. Despite controversy over her remarks on AI\u2019s impact on creative jobs\u2014'Some creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn't have been there in the first place'\u2014she has consistently advocated for responsible AI and government regulation. In September 2024, Murati left OpenAI to launch Thinking Machines Lab, a public benefit corporation focused on democratizing AI through accessible, customizable tools. The startup raised $2 billion in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Nvidia, AMD, Meta, and others, achieving a $12 billion valuation. In a high-profile move, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg launched a 'full-scale raid' on the company, offering over $1 billion to individual employees, including $200 million to $1.5 billion over multiple years. Despite these incentives, no employee accepted the offers, demonstrating strong team loyalty. Murati\u2019s vision centers on empowering individual agency through distributed, human-aligned AI. Her platform, Tinker, enables users to fine-tune large models like Meta\u2019s Llama and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen with minimal technical expertise. She was ranked 57th on Fortune\u2019s 2023 list of 'The 100 Most Powerful Women in Business' and featured in Time\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in AI in 2024.

Gordon-Levitt, a father of an 8-year-old, expressed outrage in the op-ed, warning of 'synthetic intimacy' exposing children, and urged voters to reject candidates funded by tech super PACs that have pledged up to $200 million to oppose AI regulation. In response, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone questioned Gordon-Levitt\u2019s credibility, noting that his wife, Tasha McCauley, is a former OpenAI board member who participated in the November 2023 board coup that temporarily removed CEO Sam Altman. McCauley was later replaced after Altman\u2019s reinstatement. Stone also highlighted that Meta\u2019s internal documents, leaked by Business Insider, showed the company\u2019s legal and policy teams\u2014including its chief ethicist\u2014approved guidelines permitting sexually suggestive interactions with minors. The New York Post reported on the controversy on October 1, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 05:23 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/10/01/business/meta-rips-ny-times-for-joseph-gordon-levitt-op-ed-criticizing-mark-zuckerberg/)\n\n**Stories that will change your life\u200a -- \u200aPart 2: Sam Altman**\nIn November\u202f2023, Sam\u202fAltman, the CEO of OpenAI, was abruptly fired by his board over concerns about his \u2018candid communication\u2019 style. The decision sparked an internet uproar, Microsoft threatened to pull billions of dollars, and employees staged protests. Within days, Altman was reinstated, stronger than before, a move the article describes as a \u2018plot twist of the decade.\u2019 The piece frames Altman\u2019s career as a journey from a dorm\u2011room coder to a visionary betting on AI to make humanity better, highlighting his grit, foresight and the belief that bold ideas can change the world. It notes that Altman was born on April\u202f22\u202f1985 in St.\u202fLouis, Missouri, grew up in a middle\u2011class Jewish family, and has spent the last decade shaping startups and technology. The narrative uses quotes such as \u2018candid communication\u2019 style and \u2018Why not me?\u2019 to underscore his bold persona.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 07:11 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@sanyam_learningportal/stories-that-will-change-your-life-part-2-sam-altman-712932b26aa9)\n\n**A Movie About Sam Altman's Ouster and Wild Week at OpenAI Is Currently Filming. Here's Who's Portraying the Tech CEO (and His Nemesis, Elon Musk).**\nAn upcoming film depicts the November\u202f2023 ouster of OpenAI CEO Sam\u202fAltman and his brief return after a staff revolt. The board fired Altman for 'was not consistently candid in his communications,' and interim CEO Mira\u202fMurati was appointed. Ninety\u2011five percent of employees signed a letter threatening to quit unless Altman was reinstated, and he was back in the role after a few days. The movie, shot across San\u202fFrancisco this summer, is directed by Luca\u202fGuadagnino and stars Andrew\u202fGarfield as Altman, Monica\u202fBarbaro as Murati, and Ike\u202fBarinholtz as Elon\u202fMusk. The screenplay has been compared to the 2010 film The\u202fSocial\u202fNetwork. Since the incident, Murati left OpenAI in\u202f2024 to lead the AI startup Thinking\u202fMachine\u202fLab, while other former co\u2011founders have joined Meta\u2019s AI teams.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 04:50 PM\nSource:[Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-firing-retold-as-hollywood-movie/496670)\n\n**Sam Altman: The King of Cannibals**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has become the leading figure in AI thanks to his ability to sell the apocalypse. According to his mentor Paul Graham, 'You could drop him on a deserted island of cannibals and, in five years, he would be the king.' Altman's philosophy is to 'add another zero to any success metric you define.' This mindset drives him to transform, not just accumulate wealth. His ambition is to redesign the recipe of civilization, not just get a share of the pie. His investments and obsessions, such as fusion energy and a global cryptocurrency for a universal basic income, are not secondary projects, but pieces of a larger puzzle: the total reengineering of society. By framing the fierce competition in AI as a necessary step in a crusade for humanity's benefit, Altman justifies almost any tactic. He has positioned himself as the primary prophet of existential risk, using the fear of an uncontrolled superintelligence to consolidate his power and silence his critics. As Peter Thiel observed, 'We should treat him more like a messianic figure.' However, the myth of the benevolent and omniscient leader was shattered in November 2023, when Altman was fired for being 'not consistently sincere.' The justification for his reinstatement days later, backed by his employees and Microsoft, reveals a clash of fanatics: the board's commitment to safety versus Altman's conviction that only his leadership can drive progress.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 04:10 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/neo/ia/20250818/10965558/sam-altman-llegado-mayor-genio-ia-gracias-venderte-apocalipsis-podrias-lanzarlo-paracaidas-isla-canibales-volver-cinco-anos-seria-rey.html)\n\n**The Optimism of Sam Altman: A Journey to Creating ChatGPT**\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is known as the 'father of ChatGPT', but he didn't write the code. His strength lies in his ability to persuade and drive, making the impossible possible. Altman's new book, 'Living in the Future with Altman', explores his journey from creating ChatGPT to leading the AI revolution. The book, written by a Wall Street Journal journalist, follows Altman's life from his childhood in St. Louis to his current status as one of the top leaders in the tech industry. Altman's optimism and ability to design the future are showcased through various anecdotes, including his experience as a startup accelerator at Y Combinator and his founding of OpenAI. In 2022, Altman tweeted, 'Today we're launching ChatGPT. Try it out at chat.openai.com. This is an early demo, and there are many limitations and things we're still working on.' Initially, the comments were skeptical, but as more people used ChatGPT, the response shifted to excitement. The book highlights two key themes: 'future' and 'optimism'. Altman's life has been marked by his belief that 'the future will be better'. Even when he was fired by OpenAI's board in 2023, he remained calm. Altman joined Microsoft, but the board soon began negotiating his return. He is also optimistic about the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which he believes will be able to perform all intellectual tasks. 'Most people didn't believe in AGI when I did, and I'm sure many still don't. But now, more people will be willing to try it. It's like holding onto AI and wrestling with it. This process will unfold over the next few years.' \nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: July 18, 2025 07:47 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/culture/11371502)\n\n**OpenAI's Talent Drain: A Desperate Attempt to Contain the Bleeding**\nOpenAI, the leading artificial intelligence company, has closed its doors temporarily and given its employees a week off to 'recharge'. However, this was not a wellness initiative, but a strategic retreat in the midst of a fierce and decisive war for talent. The company's arch-nemesis is Meta Platforms, the social media empire that includes Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta's tactics are becoming increasingly aggressive. In a recent message to employees, Altman acknowledged the departure of several key researchers who have been poached by Meta. 'Meta is acting somewhat unpleasantly,' Altman wrote, recognizing the 'gigantic offers' that many members of his team have received. He described the current situation as a new, chaotic but predictable phase: 'We went from being nerds in a corner to being the most interesting people in the tech industry (at least),' he commented. 'Twitter about AI is toxic,' he added, and concluded: 'After being fired and coming back, I said that it wouldn't be the most crazy thing that would happen in the history of OpenAI; this, undoubtedly, is not.' The message reflects the growing tension in the battle for talent in artificial intelligence. It also reveals something deeper: OpenAI, the leading lab in the pursuit of generative AI, may be struggling to retain its own team. To counter this, Altman is appealing to a moral argument, downplaying Meta's success in attracting talent and claiming that they 'haven't gotten their best options and had to go very low on their list.' He also acknowledged that OpenAI is evaluating the salaries of its entire research team, promising to do it 'fairly and not just for those that Meta decided to target.' This is a notable admission. To stop the talent drain, Altman is forced to play by Meta's rules.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 04, 2025 01:10 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo en Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.gizmodo.com/openai-entra-en-estado-de-panico-que-esta-pasando-2000177181)\n\n**Former OpenAI board member said companies are going to start trying to poach Meta's new AI hires from day one**\nHelen Toner, a former OpenAI board member, warned that Meta may struggle to retain its new AI hires due to the competitive nature of the industry. Toner stated that other companies will likely try to poach Meta's new AI talent from day one, and that Meta will need to show it is 'moving fast enough' in the field to retain them. Toner also expressed concerns about Meta's organizational dynamics, saying that managing egos and procuring resources will be significant challenges. Additionally, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, criticized Meta's recruitment efforts, stating that offering large signing bonuses may not set up a great culture. Toner and Altman have a complicated history, with Toner voting to fire Altman as OpenAI's CEO in November 2023. However, Toner stated that she has not interacted with Altman since his brief ouster.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 04, 2025 05:21 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/ex-openai-board-member-companies-poach-meta-new-ai-hires-2025-7)\n\n**OpenAI brings back Sam Altman as CEO just days after his firing unleashed chaos**\nOpenAI announced on November 21, 2023, that it had reached an agreement in principle for co-founder Sam Altman to return as CEO following his abrupt ouster just days earlier. The decision came after intense negotiations between Altman\u2019s team and the board, which had cited a lack of candor as the reason for his removal. The board\u2019s internal trust in Altman eroded gradually, though no serious wrongdoing was identified. The company confirmed that Altman would return under a new board composed of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D\u2019Angelo. The previous board, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who later publicly regretted the decision, largely stepped down. Elon Musk and other investors, including venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, criticized the board\u2019s governance, with Khosla accusing it of misapplying 'effective altruism' principles. Microsoft, which had hired Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman, supported a resolution that preserved OpenAI\u2019s mission and governance integrity. The company emphasized collaboration on structural and safety-related details, with interim CEO Emmett Shear stating the path taken maximized safety and stakeholder alignment. The board\u2019s structure remains under review, with a key responsibility being to determine when AI surpasses human capability in economically valuable work. The episode highlighted vulnerabilities in AI governance, with experts like Johann Laux of the Oxford Internet Institute warning of the fragility of the AI ecosystem and the urgent need for regulatory frameworks. The original board\u2019s two female members, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, both of whom raised concerns about AI safety, were removed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2023 06:35 AM\nSource:[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/altman-openai-chatgpt-31187f7f6eca8ff9d0eef7585aac6ace)\n\n",
    "date": "2025-10-29T03:46:10.592973",
    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the probability of Sam Altman being indicted before January 1, 2026 is considered very low, generally ranging from 2-5%. Most experts underscore that, as of late 2025, there is no public evidence or credible reporting of criminal investigations, whistleblower revelations, or regulatory referrals indicating that Altman is at risk of indictment. Key signals\u2014such as the regulatory approval of OpenAI\u2019s transition from nonprofit to for-profit status, absence of criminal referrals in ongoing lawsuits (e.g., Musk, New York Times), and Altman\u2019s continued high public visibility and elite backing (notably Microsoft and major investors)\u2014all point to a lack of near-term legal jeopardy. Internal governance crises (such as the 2023 board ouster for 'lack of candor') are characterized as matters of organizational transparency or philosophy rather than potential criminality, especially given no public claim of fraud or embezzlement. Experts note that the historical base rate for high-profile tech CEO indictments in the absence of blatant, well-documented fraud (as in Theranos or FTX) is extremely low.\n\nWhile some experts acknowledge that the scale, controversy, and scrutiny around OpenAI\u2014including activist pressure, ongoing civil suits, AI safety concerns, and potential for sudden whistleblower revelations\u2014mean that a shock indictment scenario is not strictly impossible, they agree such a scenario would require new and unexpected evidence. The regulatory approvals obtained after thorough review by California and Delaware Attorneys General are especially viewed as having diminished the risk of asset-transfer or nonprofit law violations. All experts articulate 'yes' scenarios centering on unforeseen whistleblower disclosures or dramatic evidence of criminal conduct, but assign these outcomes only a small, background probability given the absence of supporting developments.\n\nIn sum, the consensus is that, barring an extraordinary and currently unforeseeable event, Sam Altman is highly unlikely to be indicted in the United States before 2026. Final assigned probabilities cluster in the low single digits, with expert forecasts between 2-5%.",
