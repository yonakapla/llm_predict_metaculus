However, the legal bar is high; in nearly all past Olympic medal disputes, no reversal has occurred after IOC/CAS action, and even a win would mean further CAS review, not reinstatement of the medal per se. The absence of any reporting (up to November 27, 2025) of a Tribunal decision, with the USAG and Chiles team still publicly stating 'waiting on a decision,' suggests nothing dramatic is imminent. Further, Swiss Tribunal outcomes are typically promptly reported given the public nature of Olympic controversies.

Although the case involves allegations of procedural unfairness (such as video evidence and conflict of interest), such claims are rarely successful at the SFT unless the violations are flagrant\u2014and current reporting does not suggest so. Further, there is no reported SFT decision yet, and the typical duration of such appeals means a decision could arrive late. If the SFT sends the case back to a fresh CAS panel, a reversal might still be possible within 13 months, but this would be unprecedented in an Olympic medal allocation due to a sporting procedure (rather than, for example, a doping violation). The moral/political controversy (racism, etc.) is unlikely to sway the Swiss judiciary. On balance, the odds are extremely low, but not zero, especially as there is a formal right to appeal and ongoing media and legal advocacy.

The original question opened on 2024-08-20 17:22:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/27208). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nDuring the women's floor exercise final at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Jordan Chiles of the United States initially finished in fifth place. However, her coach filed an inquiry regarding her difficulty score, which resulted in Chiles being awarded an additional tenth of a point, moving her into third place and earning her the bronze medal.\n\nRomania, whose gymnasts Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea finished fourth and fifth respectively after the inquiry, protested the decision, claiming that Chiles' inquiry was filed too late. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) agreed with Romania's protest and vacated Chiles' inquiry, officially revising her score and placing her back in fifth place.\n\nAs a result, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that it would reallocate the bronze medal to Ana B\u01cerbosu. However, USA Gymnastics has [challenged](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/11/g-s1-16509/us-gymnast-jordan-chiles-bronze-medal-return) the CAS ruling, submitting video evidence that allegedly proves Chiles' inquiry was filed within the allowed time frame.\n\n[CNN reports](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/sport/jordan-chiles-bronze-olympics-controversy-explained/index.html) that the CAS does not have authority to revisit the case.\n\nA [CAS Bulletin](https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Bulletin202_2011.pdf) published in 2011 explores the issue of CAS appeals in more detail in the section \"Appeals against Arbitral Awards by the CAS\", starting on page 19 (pdf page 22). The section describes that CAS appeals are heard by the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which is essentially the supreme court of Switzerland, the particular conditions under which an appeal is typically heard, and says the following about the frequency and success of appeals:\n\n>Nowadays the CAS assumes that an appeal will be filed against approximately 10% of its arbitral awards. However, the success rate of these appeals is low. Since the CAS was established in 1984 only five appeals against CAS arbitral awards have succeeded. On average only 1% of all appeals against CAS arbitral awards were successful in 2009 and 2010. If one expresses the number of successful appeals as a percentage of all of the arbitral awards that have so far been delivered by the CAS (1984 \u2013 2010), the success rate is 0.3%.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":27208,\"question_id\":27208}}`",

The Russian Ski Federation appealed this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which is scheduled to hear its case on December 1, 2025. The ruling is expected no later than December 10, 2025. FIS announced the decision on October 21, shortly before the start of the Alpine Ski World Cup. Russia holds strong positions in FIS disciplines, particularly in cross-country skiing. In its CAS appeal, the Russian federation seeks the same participation conditions under FIS as those granted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the 2026 Winter Olympics, where athletes from Russia and Belarus may compete under the neutral designation AIN. Prior to the decision, FIS attempted to influence national federations by sending a questionnaire asking whether athletes from aggressor nations should be reinstated, arguing that athletes should not be discriminated against based on birthplace. However, when FIS leadership lacked sufficient support, it issued a brief statement announcing the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2026 Winter Olympics qualification, without commentary from its president, Johan Eliasch, who reportedly avoided commenting on what he viewed as a personal and painful defeat. The statement lacked the usual official remarks from FIS leadership, such as those from the president or general secretary.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 09:12 AM\nSource:[Rus.Postimees.ee](https://rus.postimees.ee/8368337/mezhdunarodnaya-federaciya-pytalas-povliyat-na-sportsmenov-i-vernut-rossiyan-v-sport-no-bezuspeshno-delo-doshlo-do-suda)\n\n**Pernilla Wiberg on Her Controversial Stance: 'It Has Been J\u00e4ttetufft'**\nPernilla Wiberg, a 55-year-old Swedish sports figure, expressed her disagreement with the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) 2022 decision to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from international competition following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Despite the criticism, Wiberg affirmed her stance, saying she spoke from a human and principled perspective based on IOC regulations and the athletes' rights. She revealed she has blocked specific words on her social media to manage online harassment. While the IOC has since allowed Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under a neutral flag for the Paris 2024 and Winter Olympics, the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) has extended the ban on Russian and Belarusian skiers, who are currently excluded from the Milano-Cortina 2026 Olympics.

The decision sparked widespread debate in gymnastics circles and online. Chiles addressed the incident at the ESPY Awards on July 16, stating she remains committed to embracing her Paris experience and that she views her performance as a bronze-level effort regardless of the final ruling. She has not yet decided whether to return for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, noting she plans to complete one more year of college before making a formal decision. As of November 25, 2025, she has not provided any new public updates on her Olympic future. Chiles is currently competing on Dancing with the Stars (DWTS) Season 34, where she and partner Ezra Sosa are in a close race for the finale. For the finale, they will perform a paso doble to Rihanna\u2019s 'Breakin\u2019 Dishes' and a freestyle to Normani\u2019s 'Motivation.'

The decision followed controversy over her public support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine, which reportedly violated the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) neutrality rules. Melnikova, 25, signed with the club earlier in November and made her debut at the second-to-last league event in Esslingen, Germany, on November 15. Although no protests occurred at the time, the city mayor, Matthias Klopfer, urged the club to reconsider her participation. On November 25, club coach Tatjana Bachmayer confirmed to Deutsche Welle that Melnikova would not compete in the final event in Heidelberg on November 29. The club's board made the decision to protect its coaches, citing a 'very tense' two-week period. FIG granted Melnikova 'neutral' status in March 2024, allowing her to compete internationally despite rules prohibiting 'active support' of the war in Ukraine. She has been photographed with the Russian military 'Z' symbol, which FIG explicitly prohibits. Melnikova also ran in Russian local elections as a candidate for United Russia, a party aligned with Putin. She declined to discuss her neutral status during an interview with SWR, responding with 'No comment.' Since 2023, FIG has permitted Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals, and three such athletes participated in the 2024 Paris Olympics trampoline events. Melnikova won two golds and one silver at the World Championships in Jakarta in October 2024, including the all-around title, prompting Putin to congratulate her on her 'brilliant achievements.' FIG has refused to comment on individual cases, stating it does not issue individual explanations. The German gymnastics league affirmed its compliance with FIG regulations.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/zh/%E5%9B%A0%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E6%99%AE%E4%BA%AC-%E4%BF%84%E4%BD%93%E6%93%8D%E8%BF%90%E5%8A%A8%E5%91%98%E8%A2%AB%E5%BE%B7%E5%9B%BD%E4%BF%B1%E4%B9%90%E9%83%A8%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E5%8F%82%E8%B5%9B/a-74881639)\n\n**Angelina Melnikowa's German Turnliga Campaign Ends Amid Political Controversy**\nAngelina Melnikowa, the Russian gymnast and self-identified supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, will not participate in the German Turnliga (DTL) final on November 29, 2025, as confirmed by TSV Tittmoning-Chemnitz coach Tatjana Bachmayer. Her planned debut in the final, following a contract signed earlier in November for the last two Bundesliga events of the season, was halted due to controversy over her political affiliations and visible support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, including being photographed with the military symbol 'Z'. Although the club initially stated the signing was based solely on sporting merit\u2014'We don\u2019t want to make a political statement,' Bachmayer said\u2014internal pressure and the intense backlash led the club\u2019s board to make the final decision to exclude her. The club cited the need to protect its coaching staff, calling the past two weeks 'very intense.' While the club has not officially confirmed the termination of Melnikowa\u2019s contract, her participation in future Bundesliga events is now effectively ended. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) granted her 'neutral athlete' status in March 2024, allowing her to compete internationally despite rules prohibiting athletes who actively support the war in Ukraine. Melnikowa has refused to comment on the matter, stating 'No comment!' in a SWR interview. She had been banned from international competition since the start of the war in 2022, missing major events including the 2022 and 2023 World Championships, the 2022 and 2023 European Championships, and the 2024 Paris Olympics. Her return as a neutral athlete was marked by a gold medal performance at the 2024 World Championships in Jakarta, where she won two golds and a silver. Russian President Putin publicly congratulated her on her 'outstanding performance.' The DTL affirmed it follows FIG regulations, and the FIG declined to comment on individual cases.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 10:39 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/de/zeit-von-angelina-melnikowa-in-deutscher-turnliga-beendet/a-74877049)\n\n**'I Did Not Fight for This': Fourcade Reacts to Awarding of 2010 Olympic Gold Medal After Ustyugov's Disqualification**\nSix-time Olympic champion Martin Fourcade responded to the upcoming awarding of the gold medal from the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver following the disqualification of Russian biathlete Evgeny Ustyugov. According to Ski Chrono, Fourcade stated, 'I did not fight for this. Some might think I feel disappointment or bitterness over what could be seen as a stolen moment of triumph. I have been rewarded for my fight against doping. My case proves that this fight still matters even 16 years later.' The medal ceremony is scheduled to take place during the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy. In September 2025, Ustyugov was stripped of his gold medal from the 2014 Sochi Olympics, as well as gold and bronze medals from the 2010 Vancouver Games, due to anti-doping rule violations identified in his past performances. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended in March 2022 that Russian and Belarusian athletes be excluded from competition, but in December 2023 it recommended allowing Russian athletes to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics under a neutral status. As the 2026 Winter Olympics approach, questions about the eligibility of Russian athletes continue to resurface, with the IOC serving as the governing body for such decisions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 08:38 PM\nSource:[\u0421\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 Mail.ru](https://sportmail.ru/news/biathlon/68869887/)\n\n**International Ski Federation's Attempt to Influence Athletes Fails; Case Reaches CAS**\nThe International Ski Federation (FIS) decided in October 2024 to exclude athletes from 'aggressor countries' from international competitions, including the current season.

The suspension stems from three missed whereabouts failures within a 12-month period between October 2024 and June 2025. In July 2025, Oleksiak voluntarily accepted a provisional suspension and did not contest the arbitral decision, agreeing to the consequences proposed by the ITA. She will be ineligible until July 2027 and will lose all individual results achieved since June 16, 2025. This includes her absence from the Paris 2024 Olympics, where she did not win medals, unlike her four medals in Rio 2016 and three in Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021 due to the pandemic). According to Suzanne Paulins, executive director of Canada's national swimming team, Oleksiak\u2019s violations were unintentional and no prohibited substances were used, but the anti-doping rules are in place to ensure fair competition. The decision may be appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but it does not prevent Oleksiak from aiming for a fourth consecutive Olympic appearance at Los Angeles 2028. Oleksiak, 25, became the first athlete born in the 21st century to win an individual Olympic gold medal in Rio 2016, tying with American Simone Manuel in the 100-meter freestyle final.

According to the International Testing Agency (ITA), Oleksiak voluntarily accepted a provisional suspension in July 2025 and did not contest the decision or challenge the proposed consequences. As a result, all individual results achieved since June 16, 2025, are nullified, and she did not win any medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics\u2014unlike her four medals in Rio 2016 and three in Tokyo 2020, which were held a year after the original schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since 2023, FIG has permitted Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals, and three such athletes participated in the 2024 Paris Olympics trampoline events. Melnikova won two golds and one silver at the World Championships in Jakarta in October 2024, including the all-around title, prompting Putin to congratulate her on her 'brilliant achievements.'

Her planned debut in the final, following a contract signed earlier in November for the last two Bundesliga events of the season, was halted due to controversy over her political affiliations and visible support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, including being photographed with the military symbol 'Z'. Although the club initially stated the signing was based solely on sporting merit\u2014'We don\u2019t want to make a political statement,' Bachmayer said\u2014internal pressure and the intense backlash led the club\u2019s board to make the final decision to exclude her. The club cited the need to protect its coaching staff, calling the past two weeks 'very intense.' While the club has not officially confirmed the termination of Melnikowa\u2019s contract, her participation in future Bundesliga events is now effectively ended. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) granted her 'neutral athlete' status in March 2024, allowing her to compete internationally despite rules prohibiting athletes who actively support the war in Ukraine. Melnikowa has refused to comment on the matter, stating 'No comment!' in a SWR interview. She had been banned from international competition since the start of the war in 2022, missing major events including the 2022 and 2023 World Championships, the 2022 and 2023 European Championships, and the 2024 Paris Olympics. Her return as a neutral athlete was marked by a gold medal performance at the 2024 World Championships in Jakarta, where she won two golds and a silver. Russian President Putin publicly congratulated her on her 'outstanding performance.' The DTL affirmed it follows FIG regulations, and the FIG declined to comment on individual cases.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 10:39 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/de/zeit-von-angelina-melnikowa-in-deutscher-turnliga-beendet/a-74877049)\n\n**Cas to Hear Russian Appeal on Olympic Participation on December 1**\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) will hear the Russian Ski Federation's appeal on December 1, 2025, in a expedited proceeding. The appeal challenges the decision by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), which, despite efforts by FIS President Johan Eliasch to align with the IOC's stance allowing individual Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano/Cortina, was rejected by the FIS executive board one month prior. The Russian Ski Federation submitted the appeal to Cas in Lausanne, Switzerland, seeking a review of FIS's decision. Cas announced that the parties will be heard via video conference on December 1, 2025, and will issue an operational decision (without reasoning) by no later than December 10, 2025.

However, the Romanian athletic commission appealed the decision, arguing the US challenge was submitted four seconds late. The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the appeal, and the International Olympic Committee ordered Chiles to return the medal, which was reallocated to Barbosu. Over a year later, during an appearance on the 'Baby, this is Keke Palmer' podcast, Chiles stated she felt racism played a role, saying, 'They didn't want to see three beautiful Black women standing on that podium,' and cited a surge in racist and threatening social media comments that led her to temporarily leave social media. She also criticized Barbosu\u2019s coach, Patrick Kiens, for celebrating prematurely before the final decision, calling it 'highly unusual and premature.' Chiles emphasized that medal ceremonies are final unless a doping or rule violation is found, which has historically been the case at past Olympics. The incident drew international attention, including a Romanian prime minister\u2019s threat to boycott the closing ceremony.

In a September 2024 interview at the Forbes Power Women's Summit and a November 2025 podcast appearance on 'Baby, this is Keke Palmer,' Chiles stated that she initially did not consider racism as a factor until she began receiving racially charged online abuse, including threats to take her life. She noted that the historic 'all-Black' podium\u2014featuring Chiles, Simone Biles, and Rebeca Andrade\u2014was rare and apparently unwelcome to some, saying, 'they didn't want to see three beautiful Black women standing on that podium.' Chiles claimed the incident was not about the medal but about her skin color. The controversy began when a US coach appealed a scoring decision, leading to a score adjustment that moved Chiles from fifth to third place, displacing Romania\u2019s Ana Barbosu, who reacted with visible distress. After CAS ruled the appeal was submitted past the one-minute deadline, the IOC required Chiles to return the medal. Chiles and Team USA have appealed the CAS decision, arguing that the appeal was submitted on time and supported by video evidence, and that the official who ruled on the case had ties to Romania. Chiles also filed an appeal with the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, claiming she was denied a fair hearing and that video evidence was not properly considered. The CAS and USOPC jointly criticized the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) for lacking proper procedures, stating that 'a great deal of heartache would have been avoided' with better mechanisms. Barbosu, who received the bronze medal after the reversal, expressed sympathy for Chiles and teammate Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, emphasizing the Olympic spirit.

Chiles stated she initially did not consider racism as a factor until she began receiving severe racist and threatening comments on social media, including death threats, which led her to temporarily leave social media. She highlighted that the podium featured the first-ever all-Black Olympic medalists in women's gymnastics\u2014herself, Simone Biles, and Rebeca Andrade\u2014and noted that the visibility of three Black women dominating the event seemed to provoke backlash. Chiles emphasized that the incident was not just about the medal but about her identity as a woman of color. The medal was initially awarded to her after a U.S. coach appealed a scoring decision, moving her from fifth to third place, displacing Romania\u2019s Ana Barbosu, who reacted in tears. However, CAS ruled the appeal was submitted past the one-minute deadline, and the IOC ordered Chiles to return the medal.

She previously spoke about the incident at the Forbes Power Women's Summit in September 2024, becoming emotional while discussing the loss of recognition of her identity.

Chiles said, 'I was like, if they told me, it's a secret. I can't tell anybody. I'm not telling anybody,' and added, 'I told Laurie [Hernandez] a few weeks ago, because I just [had] seen her in person. I was like, 'Oh, she's going to love this, because she's a remarkable person, and I love her so much.'' Chiles will dance with pro Ezra Sosa in season 34. She earned a gold medal in the women\u2019s team all\u2011around at the 2024 Paris Olympics and a bronze in the individual floor exercise, which was later stripped after a scoring appeal. The controversy involved a score adjustment by coach Cecile Landi that moved Chiles to third place, prompting the Romanian Gymnastics Federation to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) ultimately awarded the bronze to Romanian gymnast Ana B\u0103rbosu, but Chiles and her legal team have continued to contest the decision, filing appeals in the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland and seeking CAS to review audio and video evidence from Netflix\u2019s \u201cRising\u201d docuseries. On the one\u2011year anniversary of the floor exercise, Chiles posted on Instagram: 'A year ago today I walked off the floor in Paris with a bronze medal -- and lessons I'll carry with me for life,' and reflected on the highs and lows of her journey.

Chiles' coach Cecile Landi initially appealed the decision, arguing that Chiles had not been given full credit for a tour jete, a leap. However, CAS ruled in favor of the Romanians, Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voineau, citing that Chiles' inquiry was filed four seconds after the 60-second deadline. Chiles' attorneys have criticized CAS' decision, pointing out multiple flaws, including the fact that Chiles was not given sufficient notice, and that the head of the CAS panel had a potential conflict of interest. Chiles has appealed to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which is still pending. If the tribunal rules in her favor, the case will be sent back to CAS.

    "summary": "All experts converged on a very low probability (2\u20134%) that the decision to reallocate the bronze medal in the women\u2019s floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Olympics from the US to Romania will be overturned before January 1, 2026. Their analyses unanimously emphasized the extremely rare historic success rate (<1%, often 0.3%) for overturning Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) awards via appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT), which only acts on narrow procedural errors rather than merits of sporting disputes. While the US appeal cites procedural concerns\u2014timing, alleged improper exclusion of new video evidence, and possible conflict of interest\u2014experts agree these claims slightly increase but do not substantially alter the overwhelmingly negative base rates. The existing high-profile nature of the case, international media attention, and allegations of bias were seen as insufficient to sway the SFT, which is institutionally resistant to external pressure. Experts also noted the short time frame left for a decision. The most likely scenario\u2014supported across all fields (sports law, arbitration, Olympic administration, and governance)\u2014is that the SFT upholds the CAS ruling or fails to rule before the deadline, leaving the medal with Romania. Even in the unlikely event of a procedural win for the US, the process would likely involve a remand and rehearing, which would be difficult to complete before 2026. Thus, prospects for a reversal within the time limit are extremely slim, reflected in consensus probabilities of 2\u20134%.",
