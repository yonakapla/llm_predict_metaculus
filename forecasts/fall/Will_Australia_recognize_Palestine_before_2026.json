In state recognition theory (both doctrinally and in diplomatic history), recognition is not purely about the legal procedural act but about the intersubjective understanding among states that is established through clear, public, and repeated statements. The constructivist reading finds direct support here: the Australian government (PM Albanese and FM Wong) issued unequivocal, widely broadcast statements of recognition, which were received and reciprocated by other states and the Palestinian Authority as constitutive of new diplomatic facts. The constructivist lens is especially apt when considering the Metaculus-style resolution, which cares about public, widely accepted governmental recognition rather than only technical legal notes. In this case, repeated, explicit official declarations are not only rhetorical but are the constitutive act itself. This focus on performativity further reduces the likelihood of disqualification due to subtle legal ambiguities, and thus justifies the extremely high probability forecast."

For example, even after public recognition, Realism offers little analytical purchase to understand how international legitimacy is constructed and maintained\u2014key for outcomes like this, which hinge on intersubjective acceptance as well as material signaling. The Realist perspective might underappreciate how public discourse, coalition-building, and the interplay of domestic and global norms drive policy irreversibility. The constructivist lens highlights that once a performative recognition occurs, especially in coordination with peers, it becomes exceedingly difficult for a state to retract or soften without incurring serious legitimacy costs, even if core security interests shift.

Policy process theory highlights how even after formal announcements, implementation phases and international reactions can occasionally introduce obstacles or clarifications (especially in high-stakes diplomatic recognitions). While in this case, the risk of reversal or softening is extremely remote given the coordinated, highly public move, a complete forecast would acknowledge this, even if only to then dismiss it as negligible. The analysis could also benefit from recognizing how policy stickiness is reinforced not just by the act, but by subsequent entrenchment through institutionalization (e.g., changes in official Australian foreign policy documents, diplomatic representation, or engagement with Palestinian authorities). This added layer of analysis would underline the robustness of recognition, while also offering a more thorough account of how and why reversals are vanishingly rare after such announcements."

Their stress on institutional inertia and the unlikelihood of a rapid reversal following highly publicized, coalition-aligned recognition resonates with both the empirical history of Western recognitions and policy transition theory in political science. By acknowledging that only an extraordinary or unprecedented event would lead to a retraction, while also noting the reinforcing effects of international bandwagoning, the analysis offers a methodologically sound justification for an extreme probability and provides reassurance that this is not a case of premature or merely rhetorical recognition. Their approach models a best-practices application of the policy process framework to a tightly defined, time-bound diplomatic question."

In 2025, a growing number of Australian lawmakers, particularly within the Labor Party, have recently urged the federal government to officially recognize a Palestinian state.

The new partnership focuses on defence, economic stability, climate change, pandemic preparedness, and emerging technology research. Meanwhile, seven Australians detained in Israel for attempting to deliver aid to Gaza have criticized the Australian government for a lack of support, with Juliet Lamont stating they were not assisted with their deportation to Jordan and claiming they were physically abused and denied food and water during detention; Israel denies mistreatment, while DFAT confirms it continues consular assistance. A total of 472 out of 479 people detained in the flotilla incident have now been deported. In Australia, Optus failed to notify the Department of Communications of a major triple-zero outage on September 18, 2025, due to an email sent to the wrong address, and the government was not informed until September 19, more than 24 hours later; the outage affected 600 emergency calls. The Tasmanian government argues that not building the proposed $1 billion AFL stadium on the Hobart waterfront would cause reputational damage and harm future generations, despite the planning commission\u2019s formal recommendation against it; the government maintains the stadium would bring unquantifiable benefits like community pride and job creation, and although opposition Labor supports it, passage of legislation in the upper house remains uncertain. The European Union has urged Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government to improve women\u2019s rights, as it announces over $350 million in humanitarian aid, emphasizing that aid delivery depends on lifting restrictions on women, especially after a recent earthquake. In sports, Arsenal\u2019s women\u2019s team, featuring three Matildas, began their defence of the Women\u2019s European Champions League title with a 2-1 loss to French side Lyon, the eight-time champions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[SBS](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/sbs-news-in-easy-english-8-october-2025/whwmm56t5)\n\n**The Two-State Solution: A Pivotal Moment**\nA high-level conference on achieving a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian issue and implementing the two-state solution is taking place in New York on Monday, October 7, 2025, alongside the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly. This follows the launch of the 'International Coalition for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution' during the previous session, which included Arab, Islamic, European, and international organizations such as the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the European Union. Egypt hosted the coalition\u2019s fourth conference in February 2025, following earlier meetings in Saudi Arabia, Belgium, and Norway. At the prior New York conference in July 2025, Egypt called on the international community to build on its outcomes to advance comprehensive and fair peace, emphasizing that there is no alternative to fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, including liberation from occupation and the establishment of a contiguous, viable, independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Egypt also urged support for the Arab-Islamic recovery and reconstruction plan for Gaza, and the cessation of systematic Israeli violations in the West Bank. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi discussed the importance of the conference in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, stressing its role as a pivotal step toward recognizing Palestine and implementing the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders. Sisi welcomed France\u2019s announced intent to recognize Palestine, calling it a positive contribution to achieving a just and comprehensive Middle East peace, and urged other non-recognizing states to follow suit. Egypt reiterated its unwavering support for Palestine as the central issue of the Arab nation, emphasizing that regional stability cannot be achieved without a fair and comprehensive resolution to the Palestinian conflict. This stance was reaffirmed during the emergency Arab-Islamic summit in Doha, where Sisi underscored that no state\u2019s sovereignty would be violated and peace efforts would not be undermined, with all Arab and Islamic nations standing united in defense of Palestinian rights. Egypt co-founded the International Coalition, with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty stating that the current crisis stems not from October 7, 2023, but from years of illegal Israeli occupation, land confiscation, and demographic engineering, necessitating the fulfillment of Palestinian aspirations for independence. The conference is seen as a pivotal moment, especially after the UN General Assembly adopted the 'New York Declaration'\u2014the closing statement from the previous conference\u2014containing a 'roadmap' for lasting, fair, and comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Additionally, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Portugal recognized Palestine on Sunday, October 6, 2025, with at least ten more countries, including France, expected to follow shortly, despite Israel\u2019s ongoing military offensive to seize control of Gaza, the largest urban center in the territory.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5253344)\n\n**International Outcry Grows Over Israel\u2019s Gaza War: Europe and Latin America Escalate Pressure Amid Calls for Accountability**\nOn the second anniversary of the Gaza war, international condemnation of Israel intensified, with Europe and Latin America adopting stronger stances. Spain led European diplomatic efforts by formally recognizing Palestine in May 2024, imposing a comprehensive arms export ban to Israel, and blocking military cargo from entering Spanish ports. Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares demanded an immediate and unconditional halt to Israeli military operations in Gaza, stating, 'This war must stop now, regardless of negotiations,' and affirmed Spain\u2019s support for a viable, independent Palestinian state. Spain also called for revising EU-Israel partnership agreements based on human rights, a move described as a 'painful diplomatic blow' to Israel. Ireland and Norway suspended military cooperation, while Belgium joined calls to freeze the EU-Israel partnership, citing ethical and legal violations. France saw rising public and parliamentary pressure to halt arms sales and launch an international investigation into civilian casualties. The UK witnessed large-scale protests demanding a ban on companies supplying arms to Israel. The Netherlands blocked entry to extremist Israeli officials and supported EU-imposed economic restrictions, particularly on goods from Israeli settlements. Italy, under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, called for a ceasefire, demanded humanitarian access to Gaza, and expressed readiness to recognize Palestine\u2014conditional on the release of all Israeli hostages and the exclusion of Hamas from any future Palestinian government. Italy joined a joint statement by 25 countries calling for an immediate end to hostilities and humanitarian access. The EU issued a statement in September 2024 calling for an immediate ceasefire, condemning the Gaza blockade as an 'unacceptable collective punishment,' reaffirming support for a two-state solution, and endorsing ICC investigations into alleged war crimes. In Latin America, Colombia severed all diplomatic ties with Israel in May 2024, calling it a 'racist apartheid state committing crimes against humanity.' Bolivia and Chile recalled ambassadors in protest, while Brazil froze all arms deals with Israel and reassessed military and intelligence cooperation. Argentina, Nicaragua, and Peru supported UN-led investigations and signed a joint resolution demanding an independent international mission to document violations. CELAC reaffirmed full support for Palestinian rights and called for sanctions against Israeli officials responsible for attacks on civilians. According to Spanish newspaper La Raz\u00f3n, public opinion in Spain, Germany, and France shows over 60% of citizens demanding reduced cooperation with Israel, and the number of countries recognizing Palestine has risen to over 150, including three new European states in 2024. Analysts view this as the beginning of a growing diplomatic isolation of Israel, fueled by pressure from human rights groups and the ICC, which has opened investigations into attacks on hospitals, schools, and shelters in Gaza. The second anniversary marked not only a remembrance of the tragedy but also a turning point in global policy, with increasing calls for justice, accountability, and an end to the 18-year-long blockade of Gaza.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 03:24 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://m2.youm7.com/story/2025/10/7/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%85%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9/7147491)\n\n**View from The Hill: Two years of a distant war have brought much damage to Australian society**\nTwo years after the Hamas attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023, Australia has experienced significant societal damage due to the ongoing Middle East conflict. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations, including graffiti such as 'Glory to Hamas' and 'Oct 7, do it again' in Melbourne\u2019s Fitzroy, have been labeled 'terrorist propaganda' by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who called for legal consequences. A court case is ongoing over whether a protest outside the Sydney Opera House should be permitted, with the Palestine Action Group (PAG) arguing that denying the protest would set a dangerous precedent for free expression in Australia, framing the issue as constitutional. The conflict has deeply fractured Australian social cohesion, raised tensions around multiculturalism, and intensified debates over free speech, protest rights, and hate speech laws. NSW Premier Chris Minns acknowledged the balancing act between free expression and protection from vilification, noting that recent changes to hate speech laws are currently under challenge in the High Court. The Australian Jewish community has faced increased fear and attacks, including two incidents linked to Iran, which sought to incite division. Palestinian supporters have maintained consistent weekend demonstrations. The Australia-Israel relationship has deteriorated, with the Albanese government criticizing Israel\u2019s military actions and recognizing Palestinian statehood at the UN\u2014policies that have drawn sharp criticism from the Coalition, which accuses Labor of abandoning a key ally. The Greens have taken a progressive stance on Palestine, while public opinion remains divided: a September 2024 Essential poll showed 34% support and 30% opposition to Palestinian state recognition. The once-bipartisan Middle East policy, which long supported Israel and a two-state solution, has collapsed, with the Coalition now strongly pro-Israel and accusing Labor of failing to combat antisemitism.

According to a statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, the meeting aimed to reaffirm the 'friendship and trust' between France and Jordan and to strengthen bilateral cooperation in economic, technological, security, and defense sectors. Prince Hussein, 31, is the heir to the Jordanian throne and son of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania; he married Rajwa Al Sa\u00eff in June 2023. Their first child, Princess Iman bint al-Hussein, was born in August 2024. The discussion included Jordan\u2019s 'essential role in regional stability,' particularly regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On September 23, 2025, King Abdullah condemned 'an illegal occupation and flagrant violations of numerous UN resolutions, international law, and human rights conventions' at the United Nations.

Meanwhile, seven Australians detained in Israel for attempting to deliver aid to Gaza have criticized the Australian government for a lack of support, with Juliet Lamont stating they were not assisted with their deportation to Jordan and claiming they were physically abused and denied food and water during detention; Israel denies mistreatment, while DFAT confirms it continues consular assistance. A total of 472 out of 479 people detained in the flotilla incident have now been deported. In Australia, Optus failed to notify the Department of Communications of a major triple-zero outage on September 18, 2025, due to an email sent to the wrong address, and the government was not informed until September 19, more than 24 hours later; the outage affected 600 emergency calls.

The three nations emphasized that the terrorist organization Hamas must not survive or participate in future democratic elections in Palestine, called for a ceasefire in Gaza, and demanded the release of hostages. They cited direct commitments from the Palestinian Authority to reform and hold democratic elections excluding Hamas. This announcement followed their prior pledge in July 2025 to recognize Palestine before the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which began on September 9, 2025, with its high-level week running from September 22 to September 30. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by condemning the move as a threat to Israel\u2019s survival, accusing the three nations of rewarding terrorism and warning of future Israeli retaliation. He reiterated Israel\u2019s stance of achieving peace through strength, stating, 'I have to tell you: this will not happen. A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River.' Portugal also announced recognition of Palestine later the same day. Palestinian officials hailed the recognition as a victory for Palestinian rights and the justness of their cause.

This follows the launch of the 'International Coalition for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution' during the previous session, which included Arab, Islamic, European, and international organizations such as the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the European Union. Egypt hosted the coalition\u2019s fourth conference in February 2025, following earlier meetings in Saudi Arabia, Belgium, and Norway. At the prior New York conference in July 2025, Egypt called on the international community to build on its outcomes to advance comprehensive and fair peace, emphasizing that there is no alternative to fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, including liberation from occupation and the establishment of a contiguous, viable, independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Egypt also urged support for the Arab-Islamic recovery and reconstruction plan for Gaza, and the cessation of systematic Israeli violations in the West Bank. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi discussed the importance of the conference in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, stressing its role as a pivotal step toward recognizing Palestine and implementing the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders. Sisi welcomed France\u2019s announced intent to recognize Palestine, calling it a positive contribution to achieving a just and comprehensive Middle East peace, and urged other non-recognizing states to follow suit. Egypt reiterated its unwavering support for Palestine as the central issue of the Arab nation, emphasizing that regional stability cannot be achieved without a fair and comprehensive resolution to the Palestinian conflict. This stance was reaffirmed during the emergency Arab-Islamic summit in Doha, where Sisi underscored that no state\u2019s sovereignty would be violated and peace efforts would not be undermined, with all Arab and Islamic nations standing united in defense of Palestinian rights. Egypt co-founded the International Coalition, with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty stating that the current crisis stems not from October 7, 2023, but from years of illegal Israeli occupation, land confiscation, and demographic engineering, necessitating the fulfillment of Palestinian aspirations for independence. The conference is seen as a pivotal moment, especially after the UN General Assembly adopted the 'New York Declaration'\u2014the closing statement from the previous conference\u2014containing a 'roadmap' for lasting, fair, and comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Additionally, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Portugal recognized Palestine on Sunday, October 6, 2025, with at least ten more countries, including France, expected to follow shortly, despite Israel\u2019s ongoing military offensive to seize control of Gaza, the largest urban center in the territory.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5253344)\n\n**\u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e\u5df4\u4ee5\u51b2\u7a81\u7206\u53d1\u4e24\u5468\u5e74 \u52a0\u6c99\u505c\u706b\u8c08\u5224\u8fdb\u7a0b\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8**\nThe\u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e of the Israel-Palestine conflict has entered its second year on October 7, 2025, with ceasefire negotiations continuing in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. According to sources close to Hamas, the talks remain 'difficult and complex,' as Hamas has not yet responded to Israel\u2019s conditions, particularly regarding disarming Hamas and future governance of Gaza. Technical teams are discussing Israel\u2019s detailed map of withdrawal zones and the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released. Hamas has proposed mechanisms for releasing Israeli hostages and outlined conditions for a permanent ceasefire, including unimpeded humanitarian aid, the return of displaced Palestinians, immediate reconstruction under independent Palestinian technical oversight, and a fair prisoner exchange. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry stated that the talks aim to reach agreement on the first phase of the U.S.-proposed 20-point ceasefire plan, which includes hostage and prisoner releases, full and unconditional humanitarian access via UN channels, and the establishment of a security mechanism ensuring Israel\u2019s full withdrawal from Gaza and advancing a two-state solution. He emphasized the need for significant progress to end the war and alleviate Palestinian suffering. Qatar\u2019s Foreign Ministry said negotiations involved several hours of in-depth discussions, with key details still pending, and reaffirmed Qatar\u2019s role as mediator, noting that no solution satisfies all parties, but efforts continue. Qatar stressed that Gaza\u2019s future must be in Palestinian hands, and that discussions on Hamas\u2019s future are premature. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for immediate, unconditional release of hostages, an end to hostilities in Gaza and Israel, and the pursuit of a 'just and lasting peace' allowing both peoples to coexist securely and with mutual respect. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reiterated Australia\u2019s support for a two-state solution, calling for peaceful coexistence between Israel and Palestine within internationally recognized borders and a collective responsibility to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:04 PM\nSource:[news.cn](http://www.news.cn/world/20251007/9681d5c47e454728a8b131d8a3fd5ba3/c.html)\n\n**Reading council to welcomes recognition of Palestinian statehood by government**\nReading Borough Council is set to welcome the UK government's recognition of Palestine as an independent state, announced on September 21, 2024. The motion, introduced by Labour councillor Liz Terry (Coley), acknowledges the State of Palestine as comprising the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories separated by Israel. The motion expresses support for the UK government\u2019s commitment to a two-state solution, condemns the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack that killed 1,195 people, wounded 3,400, and resulted in 251 captives, and calls for the immediate release of all hostages. It also affirms the UK\u2019s moral and legal responsibility to uphold international humanitarian law and prevent further civilian suffering in Gaza. The motion supports an immediate ceasefire, the safe return of hostages, and a two-state solution, urging all parties to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Council members are asked to consent to Terry writing a letter to Foreign Secretary David Lammy in support of the recognition. The motion will be debated at a full council meeting on October 14, 2025, marking the second anniversary of the Hamas invasion. The 'two-state solution' concept originated from UN Resolution 181 (1947), which failed to establish separate states after the British Mandate ended in 1948; Israel was declared in May 1948, followed by the 1967 Six-Day War, which expanded Israeli control into Palestinian territories.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[readingchronicle.co.uk](https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/25524727.reading-council-welcome-recognition-palestine/)\n\n**International Outcry Grows Over Israel\u2019s Gaza War: Europe and Latin America Escalate Pressure Amid Calls for Accountability**\nOn the second anniversary of the Gaza war, international condemnation of Israel intensified, with Europe and Latin America adopting stronger stances. Spain led European diplomatic efforts by formally recognizing Palestine in May 2024, imposing a comprehensive arms export ban to Israel, and blocking military cargo from entering Spanish ports. Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares demanded an immediate and unconditional halt to Israeli military operations in Gaza, stating, 'This war must stop now, regardless of negotiations,' and affirmed Spain\u2019s support for a viable, independent Palestinian state. Spain also called for revising EU-Israel partnership agreements based on human rights, a move described as a 'painful diplomatic blow' to Israel. Ireland and Norway suspended military cooperation, while Belgium joined calls to freeze the EU-Israel partnership, citing ethical and legal violations. France saw rising public and parliamentary pressure to halt arms sales and launch an international investigation into civilian casualties. The UK witnessed large-scale protests demanding a ban on companies supplying arms to Israel. The Netherlands blocked entry to extremist Israeli officials and supported EU-imposed economic restrictions, particularly on goods from Israeli settlements. Italy, under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, called for a ceasefire, demanded humanitarian access to Gaza, and expressed readiness to recognize Palestine\u2014conditional on the release of all Israeli hostages and the exclusion of Hamas from any future Palestinian government. Italy joined a joint statement by 25 countries calling for an immediate end to hostilities and humanitarian access. The EU issued a statement in September 2024 calling for an immediate ceasefire, condemning the Gaza blockade as an 'unacceptable collective punishment,' reaffirming support for a two-state solution, and endorsing ICC investigations into alleged war crimes. In Latin America, Colombia severed all diplomatic ties with Israel in May 2024, calling it a 'racist apartheid state committing crimes against humanity.' Bolivia and Chile recalled ambassadors in protest, while Brazil froze all arms deals with Israel and reassessed military and intelligence cooperation. Argentina, Nicaragua, and Peru supported UN-led investigations and signed a joint resolution demanding an independent international mission to document violations. CELAC reaffirmed full support for Palestinian rights and called for sanctions against Israeli officials responsible for attacks on civilians. According to Spanish newspaper La Raz\u00f3n, public opinion in Spain, Germany, and France shows over 60% of citizens demanding reduced cooperation with Israel, and the number of countries recognizing Palestine has risen to over 150, including three new European states in 2024. Analysts view this as the beginning of a growing diplomatic isolation of Israel, fueled by pressure from human rights groups and the ICC, which has opened investigations into attacks on hospitals, schools, and shelters in Gaza. The second anniversary marked not only a remembrance of the tragedy but also a turning point in global policy, with increasing calls for justice, accountability, and an end to the 18-year-long blockade of Gaza.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 03:24 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://m2.youm7.com/story/2025/10/7/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%85%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9/7147491)\n\n**View from The Hill: Two years of a distant war have brought much damage to Australian society**\nTwo years after the Hamas attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023, Australia has experienced significant societal damage due to the ongoing Middle East conflict. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations, including graffiti such as 'Glory to Hamas' and 'Oct 7, do it again' in Melbourne\u2019s Fitzroy, have been labeled 'terrorist propaganda' by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who called for legal consequences. A court case is ongoing over whether a protest outside the Sydney Opera House should be permitted, with the Palestine Action Group (PAG) arguing that denying the protest would set a dangerous precedent for free expression in Australia, framing the issue as constitutional. The conflict has deeply fractured Australian social cohesion, raised tensions around multiculturalism, and intensified debates over free speech, protest rights, and hate speech laws. NSW Premier Chris Minns acknowledged the balancing act between free expression and protection from vilification, noting that recent changes to hate speech laws are currently under challenge in the High Court. The Australian Jewish community has faced increased fear and attacks, including two incidents linked to Iran, which sought to incite division. Palestinian supporters have maintained consistent weekend demonstrations. The Australia-Israel relationship has deteriorated, with the Albanese government criticizing Israel\u2019s military actions and recognizing Palestinian statehood at the UN\u2014policies that have drawn sharp criticism from the Coalition, which accuses Labor of abandoning a key ally. The Greens have taken a progressive stance on Palestine, while public opinion remains divided: a September 2024 Essential poll showed 34% support and 30% opposition to Palestinian state recognition. The once-bipartisan Middle East policy, which long supported Israel and a two-state solution, has collapsed, with the Coalition now strongly pro-Israel and accusing Labor of failing to combat antisemitism. These divisions, which existed before October 7, 2023, have widened dramatically. Even if peace emerges, lasting fractures, anger, and fear are expected to persist, leaving governments with enduring policy challenges.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/view-from-the-hill-two-years-of-a-distant-war-have-brought-much-damage-to-australian-society-265858)\n\n**Gaza War Opens Long-Awaited Battle for the Palestinian State**\nTwo years after October 7, 2023\u2014the pivotal moment in the Palestinian-Israeli and Arab-Israeli conflict that reshaped the region\u2014the central question remains unresolved: did the 'Al-Aqsa Flood' uprising bring the Palestinian state closer or destroy it permanently? While the war in Gaza has begun to subside, a new political battle has emerged over the establishment of a Palestinian state. Supporters argue that the attack prompted significant international recognition of Palestine, paving the way for statehood. Opponents counter that it was the Israeli military operations, mass casualties\u2014including women and children\u2014and unprecedented humanitarian crises that triggered global recognition, not the attack itself. As of October 2025, 158 out of 193 UN member states have recognized the State of Palestine, including major Western powers such as the UK, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany. This wave of recognition, particularly from key U.S. allies, has alarmed Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declaring, 'No Palestinian state will be established, and we will respond to any attempt to impose a terrorist state on us in the heart of our country.' Israeli journalist Anat Barchaki described the recognition as a 'political earthquake' and a 'slow erosion of Israel\u2019s diplomatic immunity,' signaling a changed international reality. The U.S. presidential plan by Donald Trump, while not guaranteeing statehood, opened a complex and contested path, with Palestinian sources emphasizing that recognition ignores the Palestinian Authority\u2019s authority over Gaza. The Authority insists on leading post-war governance, including holding elections within a year, unifying security forces, combating corruption, reforming curricula, and ending payments to families of prisoners and martyrs. The Palestinian leadership has welcomed Trump\u2019s efforts and issued a statement in the name of 'State of Palestine' for the first time, affirming commitment to the two-state solution and reforms. In contrast, Arab and Muslim foreign ministers issued a joint statement affirming support for the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unification of the West Bank and Gaza, a joint security mechanism, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza, and a just peace based on two states. Netanyahu rejected any Palestinian governance in Gaza, stating that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority would be involved in post-war administration. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar declared, 'We will continue our struggle against the Palestinian state for years to come. I do not want to deceive the public\u2014there is a real threat of a Palestinian state emerging.' The conflict has thus shifted from military to political, with global recognition now a key battleground between those supporting Palestinian statehood and Israel\u2019s firm opposition.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 04:11 AM\nSource:[aawsat.com](https://aawsat.com/%D8%B4%D8%A4%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A5%D9%82%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9/5194096-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A9)\n\n**Rising International Recognition Revives the Two-State Solution Efforts**\nAs of October 6, 2025, 159 out of 193 United Nations member states have recognized Palestine, following a wave of international recognition that has intensified after two years of war in Gaza.

Earlier in May\u202f2024, Spain, Norway and Ireland had jointly recognized Palestine, and Brazil had recognized it in 2010.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:04 AM\nSource:[A Cr\u00edtica](https://www.acritica.com/geral/canada-reino-unido-e-australia-reconhecem-o-estado-palestino-1.384259)\n\n**Wave of Recognitions for Palestine Shocks the UN**\nThe United Nations General Assembly in New\u202fYork has seen a surge of state\u2011recognition moves for Palestine, with the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia \u2013 all long\u2011time supporters of Israel \u2013 officially acknowledging a Palestinian state.  This shift follows earlier declarations by France in July and the expectation that Saudi Arabia will also address the two\u2011state solution at the same forum.  Belgium\u2019s foreign minister, Maxime\u202fPrevot, announced that Belgium would recognise Palestine, adding that the move would be formalised only after the release of all hostages taken on 7\u202fOctober\u202f2023 and the removal of Hamas from power.  The article notes that more than 140 UN members already recognise Palestine, and that other countries such as Malta, Portugal, Luxembourg, New\u202fZealand and Australia are also considering or have announced recognition.  The piece quotes Prevot saying, 'sanciones firmes' against the Israeli government and that the recognition will not be formalised until hostages are released and Hamas is eliminated.  It also reports that Prime Minister Anthony\u202fAlbanese linked Australia\u2019s recognition to commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including demilitarisation and general elections, and that Canadian Prime Minister Mark\u202fCarney stressed the need for coordinated action with the UK and Australia because the current Israeli government is \u2018meticulously working to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state\u2019.  The article lists countries that have not yet recognised Palestine \u2013 Panama, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Cameroon, Italy and Germany \u2013 and highlights the growing divide in Europe, where Norway, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia have joined the recognisers, while Italy and Germany remain silent.  Overall, the report presents the developments as a significant diplomatic shift that isolates Israel amid escalating humanitarian concerns in Gaza.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 10:31 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/el-mundo/la-ola-de-reconocimientos-a-palestina-estremece-a-la-onu-nid21092025/)\n\n**UK, Australia and Canada Recognise Palestine Amid Middle East Conflict**\nOn September 21 2025, the German newspaper taz reported that the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada have formally recognised the State of Palestine, following earlier announcements by Australia and Canada. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in a video message, said 'Angesichts des wachsenden Horrors im Mittleren Osten handeln wir, um die Hoffnung auf Frieden und eine Zweistaatenl\u00f6sung am Leben zu erhalten' and added 'Vor \u00fcber 75 Jahren haben wir einen israelischen Staat als Heimst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr die Juden anerkannt. Heute erkennen wir auch einen pal\u00e4stinensischen Staat an.' The article notes that Starmer had previously outlined conditions such as a ceasefire, UN\u2011approved humanitarian aid distribution and a commitment to a two\u2011state solution. It also reports that Starmer will sanction Hamas leaders in the coming weeks and described Hamas as a 'brutale Terrororganisation' that should not play a role in a future Palestinian government.\n\nThe piece describes the diplomatic context: the first G7 states to recognise Palestine, the upcoming two\u2011state conference in New York on Monday before the UN General Assembly, and the reaction of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the recognition a threat to Israel\u2019s existence. It also mentions the Israel Time Coalition, a joint group of Jewish and Palestinian Israeli peace activists, which supports the move, and quotes Yehuda Shaul of the Israeli public\u2011affairs centre Ofek, who says the growing pressure in the UN Security Council could isolate the United States, the only permanent member not recognising Palestine.\n\nThe article further outlines the European stance: the EU has repeatedly urged a two\u2011state solution but has only recognised Palestine after a successful negotiation; Sweden\u2019s 2014 recognition began to erode this policy, and in 2024 Spain, Ireland, Norway and Slovenia followed. Germany and Italy, however, still refuse recognition, with German Foreign Minister Friedrich Merz not attending the conference and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\u2019s deputy Antonio Tajani being sent instead. It concludes that the diplomatic moves in New York are unlikely to affect the Gaza war or the humanitarian crisis unless the United States also changes its position, noting that the U.S. denied entry to the Palestinian delegation and that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will participate via video link.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 06:03 PM\nSource:[taz.de](https://taz.de/Krieg-in-Nahost/!6111399/)\n\n**Canada, Australia and UK Recognise Palestine: Diplomatic Implications**\nOn 21\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom simultaneously announced recognition of the State of Palestine, a move described as a \"turning point\" in Western policy toward the Palestinian issue.

The article reports that 147 of 193 UN members already recognise Palestine, including Russia since 1988, but the United States, the United Kingdom, France and 42 other states do not.  A high\u2011level UN conference in New\u202fYork from 28\u201330\u202fJuly, organised by Saudi Arabia and France, produced a joint statement by 15 foreign\u2011ministerial delegations (Australia, Andorra, Ireland, Iceland, Spain, Canada, Luxembourg, Malta, New\u202fZealand, Norway, Portugal, San\u202fMarino, Slovenia, Finland and France) affirming that recognising Palestine is a key step toward a two\u2011state settlement.  Experts quoted in the piece\u2014Alexander\u202fKargin, Makram\u202fHuri\u202fMahul and Khaled\u202fAbdel\u202fMajid\u2014argue that the recognitions are largely symbolic and unlikely to bring immediate practical changes, citing the continued dominance of the United States in international politics and the need for clear definitions of borders, the status of East\u202fJerusalem and the right of return for refugees.  The article presents these facts and viewpoints without overt editorialising, offering a balanced overview of the diplomatic developments and their potential implications.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 04:08 PM\nSource:[URA.RU](https://ura.news/news/1052999065)\n\n**UK formally recognises state of Palestine to revive hope of peace, two-state solution**\nOn 21 September 2025, the United Kingdom announced formal recognition of the State of Palestine, a move aimed at reviving hope for a two\u2011state solution. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the recognition was not a reward for Hamas, calling the group a 'brutal terror organisation' and insisting that the decision would give Hamas 'no role in government or security'. He also directed sanctions against other Hamas figures. Starmer urged Hamas to release all Israeli hostages taken on 7 October 2023 and described the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as 'utterly intolerable', noting that 'tens of thousands have been killed, including thousands as they tried to collect food and water'. The announcement follows a July plan that would grant statehood only if Israel agreed to a Gaza ceasefire, a long\u2011term sustainable peace, and UN aid resumption. The UK joins 150 countries that have recognised Palestine, and other states such as France, Portugal, Canada, Australia, Spain, Ireland, Norway and India have also made the move. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the recognition 'rewards terror', while U.S. President Donald Trump opposed the move and demanded hostages be released before further action. U.S. critics warn the recognition could empower Hamas and undermine Israel's security. The announcement came amid internal pressure on Starmer from the Labour Party ahead of its annual conference.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/world/uk-formally-recognises-state-of-palestine-to-revive-hope-of-peace-two-state-solution/2748048/)\n\n**UK, Canada and Australia officially announce recognition of Palestine**\nOn September\u202f21\u202f2025, the prime ministers of the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia announced that their governments would formally recognise the state of Palestine. UK Prime Minister Kir Starmer said the UK recognises Palestine \"to revive hope for peace and a two\u2011state solution\", called Hamas a \"harsh terrorist organisation\" and pledged new sanctions. He added that the UK had recognised Israel more than 75\u202fyears ago and now joins over 150 countries that also recognise Palestine. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Israel\u2019s settlement expansion on the West Bank and attacks on Gaza had caused \"tens of thousands of civilians\" deaths and famine, and that Canada recognises Palestine and offers partnership for a peaceful future. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny\u202fWong said Australia recognises the \"legitimate and longstanding aspirations\" of the Palestinian people and that the move is part of coordinated international efforts for a two\u2011state solution. Earlier in May\u202f2024, Norway, Ireland and Spain had recognised Palestine, followed by France and the UK, and later Canada and Australia. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry called the Canadian decision a \"reward for Hamas\" and a \"strike on ceasefire efforts in Gaza\", and the United States and Israel do not recognise Palestine.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 01:36 PM\nSource:[Meduza](https://meduza.io/news/2025/09/21/velikobritaniya-kanada-i-avstraliya-ofitsialno-ob-yavili-o-priznanii-palestiny)\n\n**Australia and France to Recognize Palestinian State**\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that Australia will recognize the Palestinian state ahead of the upcoming UN General Assembly in September. Albanese stated, 'Breaking the cycle of violence in the Middle East, ending the conflict, suffering, and hunger in Gaza, a two-state solution is the hope of humanity.' He also highlighted the dire situation in Gaza, saying, 'The situation in Gaza has gone beyond the world's biggest fears. The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny adequate aid, food, and water to desperate people, including children.' Albanese rejected the notion that the recognition of Palestine is just symbolic, saying, 'This decision is an important contribution to gaining momentum.' Australia joins 147 UN member states that have officially recognized Palestine since 2025, including regional powers such as China, Russia, South Africa, Brazil, and Indonesia. In Europe, countries like Sweden (2014), most Eastern European countries, and recently Spain, Norway, and Ireland (2024) have also recognized Palestine. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will also recognize Palestine and make a formal statement at the UN General Assembly in September, saying, 'In order to remain faithful to our historical commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the Palestinian state.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: August 11, 2025 07:14 AM\nSource:[Yeni Akit Gazetesi](https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/haber/bir-ulke-daha-haykirdi-filistini-taniyacagiz-1948625.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all experts, there is unanimous, near-certainty (probability: 99%) that Australia has recognized Palestine before 2026. Every expert\u2014drawing from diverse perspectives such as diplomacy, international relations (constructivism and realism), Australian domestic politics, comparative politics, policy process, and Middle East studies\u2014points to multiple credible, contemporaneous reports from late September 2025 confirming that the Australian federal government, led by Prime Minister Albanese and Foreign Minister Wong, formally and publicly recognized the State of Palestine. This action was part of a coordinated diplomatic move alongside the UK and Canada, and was widely reported by international and Australian media. The base rates for such recognitions being reversed or substantially misunderstood are extremely low, with no credible evidence of later walk-back, ambiguity, or condition that would render the recognition void under Metaculus's resolution criteria. Experts highlight that party-political will, international peer alignment, domestic pressures, and historical diplomatic behavior all point toward this being a completed, official act of recognition. The only plausible 'No' scenario would require an unprecedented, formal retraction or a critical reporting error, both considered extremely unlikely by the group. Therefore, the consensus is that the question will resolve Yes with virtual certainty.",
