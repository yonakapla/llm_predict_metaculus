Defenses of lower probabilities (such as those aligned with Y-chromosome or mitochondrial DNA specialists) validate the weight placed on technical and institutional inertia, as well as the negative Bayesian signal from official silence.

Key points that emerged: (1) Embalming and prolonged burial materially increase the rate of inconclusive or failed extractions\u2014even with advanced modern techniques. (2) In famous, media-centric cold cases, positive breakthroughs are almost always publicized rapidly; the current late-stage silence is a strong Bayesian negative indicator.

The woman, identified as Linda Cecilia Haddad, was 39 years old at the time of her death and originally from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her remains were found by a passerby and an IDOT snowplow driver along US Route 136 between Le Roy and Bellflower. Initial medical examiners found no evidence of foul play, but her identity remained unknown despite extensive investigations, including interviews with individuals who had given her rides, forensic anthropological analysis, and DNA submissions to CODIS and NamUs, which yielded no matches. In 2016 and again in 2021, leads were pursued but did not result in identification. In August 2023, Moxxy Forensic Investigations, in partnership with the McLean County Coroner's Office and Sheriff's Office, reopened the case. After a fundraising campaign achieved its goal in November 2024, genetic genealogical analysis began in February 2025. By late March 2025, a potential candidate was identified through living relatives; a DNA sample from a relative confirmed the match. Final confirmation was made on August 1, 2025, when genetic comparison confirmed Linda Cecilia Haddad, born August 27, 1942, as the deceased. The investigation involved collaboration with Genologue (Atlanta, GA) for DNA sequencing, Parabon NanoLabs (Reston, VA) for bioinformatics, and the public DNA database GEDmatch. Seven investigative genetic genealogists conducted a month-long analysis. Moxxy Forensic Investigations' co-founder Kaycee Connelly called the case 'a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when science, compassion, and determination come together.'

She reports that he locks eyes, touches, and kisses these women while she feels ignored, humiliated, and disrespected.

Eric replies with two pieces of advice: 1) if the boyfriend refuses to stop, she should separate herself from the relationship until the issue is resolved, and 2) she should seek confirmation from trusted friends about what she is witnessing. Eric emphasizes that the behavior is unhealthy and that she should not dismiss her own experience. The second part of the article is a separate letter from a 64\u2011year\u2011old man to his father. He recounts discovering through DNA testing that his three children are not biologically his, and that his ex\u2011wife has had children with other men. He expresses deep emotional conflict but also a commitment to his children and grandchildren. He writes to his father, explaining that family is defined by love and connection rather than blood relation, and that his children consider him their father.

The woman, identified as Linda Cecilia Haddad, was 39 years old at the time of her death and originally from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her remains were found by a passerby and an IDOT snowplow driver along US Route 136 between Le Roy and Bellflower. Initial medical examiners found no evidence of foul play, but her identity remained unknown despite extensive investigations, including interviews with individuals who had given her rides, forensic anthropological analysis, and DNA submissions to CODIS and NamUs, which yielded no matches. In 2016 and again in 2021, leads were pursued but did not result in identification. In August 2023, Moxxy Forensic Investigations, in partnership with the McLean County Coroner's Office and Sheriff's Office, reopened the case. After a fundraising campaign achieved its goal in November 2024, genetic genealogical analysis began in February 2025. By late March 2025, a potential candidate was identified through living relatives; a DNA sample from a relative confirmed the match. Final confirmation was made on August 1, 2025, when genetic comparison confirmed Linda Cecilia Haddad, born August 27, 1942, as the deceased. The investigation involved collaboration with Genologue (Atlanta, GA) for DNA sequencing, Parabon NanoLabs (Reston, VA) for bioinformatics, and the public DNA database GEDmatch. Seven investigative genetic genealogists conducted a month-long analysis. Moxxy Forensic Investigations' co-founder Kaycee Connelly called the case 'a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when science, compassion, and determination come together.' Haddad\u2019s family expressed gratitude to the investigative teams and the people of Le Roy, Illinois, who had helped her in her final days. McLean County Sheriff Matt Lane praised the dedicated efforts of past and present investigators, stating the case brought closure after 43 years.

The judge used default\u2011judgment authority because the presumed father, Theodore Gifford, did not contest the petition. DNA testing matched Logan and Theodore to the teen at 99.9%, an ambiguous result that does not confirm biological paternity. Logan, who has been the primary caregiver since his mother\u2019s release from prison in 2025, now has legal standing to make decisions about the boy\u2019s education, healthcare and custody. The mother pleaded Alford in 2015 to charges of attempted sexual assault and lewdness with a minor, was sentenced to 8\u201120 years and served about nine years. The ruling underscores the court\u2019s role in protecting vulnerable children while acknowledging the limits of genetic evidence in sibling\u2011paternity cases.

The initiative is part of a nationwide effort to aid criminal investigations, citing the 28\u2011year\u2011old rape\u2011murder case in Nanjing that was solved in 2020 when the suspect\u2019s Y\u2011DNA matched a sample from a male relative in the Y\u2011library. The bureau\u2019s staff confirmed that the collection is not compulsory, saying \u2018\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u91c7\u96c6\u2019. The Y\u2011library, which records Y\u2011chromosome data from male family members, is said to be effective because Y\u2011DNA is passed unchanged from father to son, making it useful for tracing paternal lineages. Experts quoted in the piece explain that a Y\u2011library can narrow investigations to a specific family branch, saving time and resources.

Researchers traced the male line of the da\u202fVinci family back to 1331, covering 21 generations and about 400 individuals, and identified at least six living descendants whose DNA confirms a direct link to Leonardo.  The team has also confirmed the existence of a family burial site in the Santa\u202fCroce\u2011in\u2011Vinci church, where the remains of Leonardo\u2019s grandfather Antonio, uncle Francesco, and full\u2011blood brothers are believed to lie.  The next step is to perform genetic analysis of those remains to compare them with the DNA of the living descendants and reconstruct Leonardo\u2019s full genome.  \"Further detailed analyses are needed to determine whether enough DNA has been preserved,\" said David\u202fCaramelli of the University of Florence.  \"By restoring Leonardo\u2019s DNA we hope to understand the biological roots of his exceptional vision and creative abilities,\" added Alessandro\u202fVettczi of the Leonardo da\u202fVinci Heritage Association.  The successful reconstruction of Leonardo\u2019s genome could not only clarify the circumstances of his life and death but also provide insights into the health of great historical figures, potentially revealing new genetic patterns.  The study is considered a sensational breakthrough for both art historians and medical researchers.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 02:26 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/science/2283700-leonardo-da-vinci-dna-research/)\n\n**Asking Eric: DNA testing gave shocking results about my 3 children**\nA 64\u2011year\u2011old man writes to a friend named Eric, explaining that he discovered through DNA testing that his three children\u2014two boys and a girl who were 2, 4, and 6 years old when he was 26\u2014are not biologically his.

The author, who grew up in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, learned that his father had fathered a child with a woman who later married the author's mother, resulting in Linda\u2019s birth in 1954. The DNA match was a 25\u202f% paternal match, prompting the author to send a brief message to Linda asking if they shared the same father. Linda responded quickly, saying, 'Nothing would surprise me,' and revealed that she had always suspected something was amiss in her family. She had been teased as an adopted child and had long wondered why she differed from her siblings. The author and Linda met in person, found striking physical and personality similarities, and have since maintained contact, even traveling together. The narrative explores the emotional complexities of late\u2011life sibling discovery, including the author's lingering grief over his father's death, the sense of loss and anger Linda may feel about never knowing her biological father, and the lack of cultural or literary guidance for such relationships. The author reflects on how this revelation reshapes his understanding of his past and future, and he questions whether he and Linda should merge families, cultivate a private sisterhood, or simply appreciate the serendipity of their meeting.

The Leonardo da\u202fVinci DNA Project, led by Alessandro Vezzosi, Agnese Sabato, David Caramelli, and Elena Pilli, has identified 15 direct male\u2011line descendants linked to Leonardo\u2019s father and half\u2011brother.  Geneticists tested six of these men and found matching Y\u2011chromosome fragments, confirming a 15\u2011generation continuity of the Da\u202fVinci line.  The team plans to compare this living DNA with remains excavated from the Church of Santa\u202fCroce in Vinci, where bone fragments of Leonardo\u2019s grandfather Antonio, his uncle Francesco, and other relatives were recovered.  Caramelli notes that \u2018Further detailed analyses are necessary to determine whether the DNA extracted is sufficiently preserved,\u2019 and that a match would validate centuries of genealogical work.  The project\u2019s goal is to use the DNA to learn about Leonardo\u2019s visual acuity, health, diet, left\u2011handedness, and to potentially verify the authenticity of disputed works.  As Jesse H.

Preer, a 49\u2011year\u2011old mother from Chevy Chase, was found dead in her upstairs bathroom; the original investigation had focused on her husband, Carl \"Sandy\" Preer, who had a strained marriage and a failed polygraph.  DNA recovered from under Preer\u2019s fingernails did not match Sandy, leaving the case unsolved for 23 years.\n\nIn 2022, Augustin was transferred to the cold\u2011case unit and teamed with Dupouy.  They obtained an enhanced DNA profile from Othram, a forensic genetics company, and entered it into public genetic databases.  The search produced a high\u2011match profile linked to a Romanian family line.  Augustin traced the surname \"Gligor\" back to Eugene Gligor, Preer\u2019s daughter\u2019s high\u2011school boyfriend, who was a first cousin twice removed of the Romanian match.\n\nThe detectives collected a DNA sample from a discarded water bottle at Dulles Airport, confirming that Gligor\u2019s DNA matched the sample found under Preer\u2019s fingernails.  They secured arrest warrants, and Gligor was apprehended in Washington, D.C., extradited to Maryland, and charged with second\u2011degree murder.  He pleaded guilty in May 2024 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in August 2025.\n\nDetective Augustin said, 'Throughout my whole career, my goal was to get to the cold case unit,' and noted that the case \"was a sense of closure and just rewarding, letting them know we got the guy and we didn\u2019t forget about Leslie.\"  The investigation cleared Preer\u2019s husband of any involvement and brought closure to the Preer family.\n\nKey metrics: 2001 murder, 23\u2011year cold case, 2022 transfer to cold\u2011case unit, 2024 guilty plea, 22\u2011year sentence in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 05:06 PM\nSource:[abc7ny.com](https://abc7ny.com/post/how-detectives-used-genetic-genealogy-crack-open-23-year-old-cold-case/17801904/)\n\n**Six Men Share Da Vinci\u2019s DNA: Science Opens an Unexpected Path to His Tomb**\nThe Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project, led by Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato, reconstructed seven centuries of genealogy from parish, notarial, and judicial records. Although Leonardo had no direct descendants, the researchers traced the paternal line and half\u2011siblings to locate living male descendants. Of the fifteen identified, six agreed to participate in a genetic analysis coordinated by forensic anthropologist Elena Pilli. The study focused on the Y chromosome, which is transmitted nearly intact from father to son. The concordance among the six descendants confirmed the continuity of the male line across fifteen generations. Scientists also recovered remains of historical ancestors from Tuscan cemeteries, validating their belonging to the same lineage through dating and paleogenomics. Comparison of ancient bones and current DNA supports the lineage, though final verification with the tomb in Amboise, France remains pending. The project also aims to apply genetics to authenticate artworks by analyzing microorganisms, fibers, or biological traces in manuscripts and canvases, matching them to Leonardo\u2019s reconstructed genetic profile. This approach is already used in Europe to resolve questions about old works and could help identify forgeries or confirm authorship, rewriting part of art history. The complete sequencing of Leonardo\u2019s DNA could provide clues about his ancestry, physical traits, and possible medical conditions, offering unprecedented biological context. While genetics cannot explain the origin of genius, it can close questions that history and art criticism have not resolved. The discovery of living descendants and the possibility of comparing their genes with remains and objects linked to Leonardo marks a milestone: modern science is closer than ever to solving the mystery of his tomb and opening a new era in cultural heritage studies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 01:40 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo en Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.gizmodo.com/seis-hombres-comparten-el-adn-de-da-vinci-la-ciencia-abre-un-camino-inesperado-hacia-su-tumba-2000188141)\n\n**6 Living Men Share Leonardo da Vinci's DNA.

This study, the result of decades of interdisciplinary work, also located a family tomb in Vinci that could contain remains compatible with the lineage of the Renaissance genius. The discovery allows for the advancement of da Vinci's genetic profile reconstruction, opening new avenues for understanding aspects of his biology and health, still unknown after five centuries. The study, part of the Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project, was led by Italian researchers Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato, and published in the book Gen\u00eca Da Vinci. Genealog\u00eda e Gen\u00e9tica per il ADN di Leonardo, edited by Angelo Pontecorboli Editore. The research reconstructed a 21-generation genealogical tree, starting from 1331, by analyzing parish records, wills, land registries, and death certificates. The team identified 15 living male descendants of the same family branch as da Vinci's father and one of his half-brothers, Domenico Benedetto. Of these, six voluntarily underwent genetic analysis, revealing clear coincidences in their Y chromosomes. The study highlights the importance of the Y chromosome, which remains almost unchanged from father to son, allowing direct connections to be established in the male line without the need for direct descent, essential given da Vinci's lack of known children. The researchers also located a family tomb in the church of Santa Croce in Vinci, where da Vinci's grandfather Antonio, his uncle Francesco, and several of his half-brothers were buried. Fragments of bones found during the excavation have been dated using carbon 14, and one of them corresponds to a male whose chronology matches the sought-after family generation. The fragment is currently undergoing paleogenetic analysis to determine if its DNA can be compared with that of the living descendants and confirm its belonging to the Da Vinci lineage. If the results match, the team will move towards a more ambitious goal: the partial reconstruction of da Vinci's genetic profile. One of the most striking findings related to the project was a drawing discovered in an old house in Vinci, representing a fantastical creature, the 'Unicornio Drag\u00f3n', and showing stylistic similarities with da Vinci's anatomical studies. Although its authorship is still under study, the drawing was restored and analyzed due to its potential artistic and scientific value. The research not only has a genetic dimension but has also become a tool for reconstructing da Vinci's territory, i.e., the physical and social environment he inhabited. Thanks to the analysis of land registries and writings, the authors of the project have located up to seven family homes in the Vinci area and two inherited properties by da Vinci. The project poses several future lines of study: 'The study of da Vinci's living relatives represents a turning point in the combination of history, archaeology, and biology. The goal is not to build a myth, but to better understand the factors that contributed to forming a figure so influential. It is even possible to find indications of the abilities that characterized him: sharp vision, advanced spatial thinking, multifaceted creativity. In da Vinci's own writings, one can observe reflections on heredity, reproduction, and the impact of the environment on children, made centuries before the development of modern genetics, reinforcing the interest in recovering biological data from the artist from a scientific and non-idealized perspective.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/historia/estupefaccion-cientificos-hallazgo-6-parientes-vivos-leonardo-da-vinci-traves-adn-14852144)\n\n",

    "summary": "Expert forecasts regarding whether the Somerton Man's DNA will be matched to 'Jestyn's' family before the December 31, 2025, deadline generally agree on several core factors and uncertainties. Across perspectives\u2014from forensic genetics, genetic genealogy, Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA analysis, to historical and social context\u2014most experts highlight significant technical advances in the recovery of degraded DNA and the growing success rates in resolving decades-old cold cases (including those with embalmed or very old remains). The presence of volunteered, high-quality comparison DNA from 'Jestyn's' family, coupled with rare phenotypic traits shared between the Somerton Man and Robin Thomson, increases the plausibility of a biological relationship and thus the chances of a positive match, assuming DNA can be successfully extracted and analyzed. \n\nHowever, nearly all forecasters also emphasize persistent risks: the substantial difficulties associated with extracting usable DNA from embalmed, long-buried remains, the historically lower success rates in such circumstances, and the strict requirement for a publicly announced or officially confirmed result by end of 2025. The lack of any public confirmation as of October 2025, despite major technical attempts and sustained public/media interest, is interpreted by most as a negative signal for the likelihood of resolution within the required timeframe. \n\nTypical probabilities assigned by experts range from 12% (particularly those focusing on Y-chromosome analysis and the lack of recent news) up to 39%, with one notably higher outlier (75%) from a kinship analysis forecaster who weighs recent technical breakthroughs and strong motivation for closure more optimistically. Most other estimates cluster between 20% and 39%. Nearly all agree that while the biological relationship is plausible (or even likely), the odds that it will be officially established and announced in the brief time remaining are not high, primarily due to DNA preservation challenges and institutional/publication delays. The consensus thus reflects cautious optimism about technical capability but pessimism about administrative and temporal constraints, with a best-estimate probability that the question resolves 'Yes' below 40%, and most experts expecting a 'No' by default due to procedural or technical barriers.",
