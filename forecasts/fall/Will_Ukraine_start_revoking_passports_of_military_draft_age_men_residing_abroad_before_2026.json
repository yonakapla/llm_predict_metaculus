No reports\u2014even as of late September 2025\u2014indicate the government readying such a drastic step; ministries have rather focused on tightening the linkage between the military registry and access to consular services. Credible media distinguish rumors from policy, and the main echo chamber for mass passport revocation remains Russian info-space. While further tightening is possible (e.g., blacklisting, red notices, or in-country consequences for non-compliance), mass invalidation with announcement seems very unlikely absent a further major escalation or collapse. The window to implement and publicize such a policy before January 1, 2026 is shrinking.

Such an extreme move would backfire diplomatically and run counter to the need for continued Western humanitarian, military, and financial support. No major wartime government in the post-Soviet space, facing actual or potential manpower crisis, has enacted a mass passport revocation of this kind, given the technical, legal, and foreign policy obstacles, and the severe alienation among key constituencies it would create. The current crisis is severe, and social stresses are growing, but none of the available news or legal developments indicate the key threshold (active revocation initiative, not mere denial of renewal/services) has been or is about to be crossed. Rumors and Russian amplification do not substitute for credible, publicized action; indeed, rumors exist precisely because this would be such a drastic escalation. While Ukraine\u2019s pressure on its diaspora will continue, the expected path is to ratchet up bureaucratic friction, not undertake public mass revocations.

While all signs today point toward continued administrative coercion not revocation, the tail risk is, in my judgment, still a bit higher than 'minimal.'

He also noted that the campaign would use the Unified Military Registry while paper summonses would remain in circulation.

(the article quotes TASS). Russia operates a mixed conscription system, with regular conscription twice a year and a service period of one year (the article explains). The age limit for conscription was raised from 27 to 30 after the start of the Ukraine 'special military operation' in 2023 (the article notes).

The campaign will run from October\u00a01 to December\u00a031 and is expected to mobilize 135,000 men aged 18\u201130 who are not in reserve. The decree also states that soldiers whose service term has ended will be discharged. In 2024, 133,000 citizens were conscripted during the autumn draft, and in June 2024 the State Duma raised the upper age limit for conscription from 27 to 30, which will increase the number of conscripts by more than two million in the coming years. On January\u00a030, the Main Intelligence Directorate reported that in 2025 Russia plans to bring at least 126,000 soldiers from the so\u2011called special contingent (prisoners, debtors, etc.) into the war against Ukraine. Overall, the Kremlin aimed to mobilize 280,000 people this year. In April, Ukrainian General Staff commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said the aggressor Russia adds 8\u20119 thousand troops per month through contract soldiers, amounting to 120\u2011130 thousand per year. On June\u00a021, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence reported an increase in forced mobilization of Central Asian citizens for the war against Ukraine, who are lured by quick wages and short\u2011term contracts but most die quickly. Key metrics: 135,000 conscripts planned for 2025; 133,000 conscripted in 2024; 126,000 special contingent soldiers targeted for 2025; 280,000 mobilized this year; 8\u20119 thousand contract soldiers added monthly; 120\u2011130 thousand contract soldiers added annually.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 12:35 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukr/world/countries/putin-pidpisav-ukaz-pro-osinniy-prizov-do-armiji-novini-rosiji-50548780.html)\n\n**This Year, the Numbers Will Be Higher: Putin Signs Decree on Autumn Military Draft**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on 29\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 ordering an autumn draft for 2025.

The campaign will run from October\u00a01 to December\u00a031 and is expected to mobilize 135,000 men aged 18\u201130 who are not in reserve. The decree also states that soldiers whose service term has ended will be discharged. In 2024, 133,000 citizens were conscripted during the autumn draft, and in June 2024 the State Duma raised the upper age limit for conscription from 27 to 30, which will increase the number of conscripts by more than two million in the coming years. On January\u00a030, the Main Intelligence Directorate reported that in 2025 Russia plans to bring at least 126,000 soldiers from the so\u2011called special contingent (prisoners, debtors, etc.) into the war against Ukraine. Overall, the Kremlin aimed to mobilize 280,000 people this year. In April, Ukrainian General Staff commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said the aggressor Russia adds 8\u20119 thousand troops per month through contract soldiers, amounting to 120\u2011130 thousand per year. On June\u00a021, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence reported an increase in forced mobilization of Central Asian citizens for the war against Ukraine, who are lured by quick wages and short\u2011term contracts but most die quickly.

Pensioners and recipients of social assistance may lose payments if they have not completed mandatory identification by the deadline; identification can be done at a PPU service centre, via video call, or through the \u2018Diia.Pidpis\u2019 electronic cabinet. The state will automatically add a pension supplement for those aged 70 and over: 300 UAH for ages 70\u201374, 456 UAH for 75\u201379, and 570 UAH for 80+. An additional payment is available for single people over 80 who need external care, subject to medical and family\u2011structure certificates. On 26 October, clocks will be set back one hour at 04:00 to observe winter time. The heating season for 2025/2026 will begin when the average temperature for three consecutive days does not exceed +8\u00b0C; the government has prepared 115,000 houses and nearly 22,000 social\u2011sector facilities for the cold. New rules for card\u2011to\u2011card transfers aim to increase transparency and reduce fraud. Basic social assistance will become available to all eligible individuals, with a six\u2011month duration and automatic two\u2011year renewal. From 12 October, EU border crossing rules for Ukrainian citizens will change: the Entry/Exit System (EES) will replace passport stamps for stays up to 90 days within any 180\u2011day period, recording biometric data and passport details.

State Border Guard Service spokesman Andrey\u202fDemchenko said 'young people had already begun departing after the travel ban was lifted' and reported that large numbers were heading toward the Polish and Hungarian borders, causing traffic jams that have been widely publicized on social media. He confirmed that the first applicants had already completed the necessary paperwork at checkpoints and left the country. Prime Minister Yulia\u202fSvyrydenko announced the regulation on Tuesday, stating it would apply to all men in the age group, including those already abroad, and it took effect on Thursday, requiring those crossing the border to present a passport and military ID. Ukraine\u2019s general mobilisation, which mandates all able\u2011bodied men aged 25\u201160 to serve, has failed to offset ongoing battlefield losses and has reportedly led commanders to voice concerns over persistent manpower shortages.

The changes, announced by State Border Service spokesperson Andriy Demchenko, will take effect only after the decree is published on the official Government portal. The new rule does not apply to men 18\u201160 who are subject to mobilization, nor to officials holding state or local government positions, who may travel only on official assignments.

The amendment follows the 16 May 2024 decree \u2116\u202f560 that obliges border guards to check such documents, and the 24 February 2022 presidential decree that extended martial law until 5 November 2025.

Men aged 18 to 22\u202finclusive now have unrestricted border crossing, while those holding positions in state authorities or local self\u2011government remain limited to official business. All travelers must carry a passport and a military\u2011registration document (paper or electronic) and present them at checkpoints upon request. The decree takes effect the day after its official publication. The change follows earlier discussions: in July\u202f2023, Speaker Ruslan Stepanchuk noted that 18\u201122\u2011year\u2011olds were not subject to mobilization but were restricted from leaving. On August\u202f12\u202f2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a simplified procedure for this age group to maintain ties and educational opportunities. RBC\u2011Ukraine correspondent Fedir Veniyslavsky explained that the restrictions forced young Ukrainians to seek semi\u2011illegal routes to study abroad.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: August 27, 2025 12:31 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/viyizd-kordon-cholovikiv-22-rokiv-z-yavivsya-1756297899.html)\n\n**Ukraine Lowers Wartime Exit Restrictions, Allowing 18\u201122\u2011Year\u2011Old Men to Leave**\nUkraine has relaxed wartime exit restrictions, allowing men aged 18\u201122 to leave the country freely for the first time since the war began more than three years ago.  Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced the change on her Telegram channel on 26\u202fAugust, stating that the new measure also applies to citizens currently abroad.  She said, '\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u70cf\u514b\u862d\u4eba\u80fd\u5118\u53ef\u80fd\u8207\u7956\u570b\u4fdd\u6301\u806f\u7e6b'.  The policy comes as the Verkhovna Rada reviews an amendment to formalise wartime exit rules, giving men below draft age more freedom.  Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk had earlier criticised the existing policy as unfair, noting that 18\u201125\u2011year\u2011old men were prohibited from studying abroad or reuniting with family; he said at a Kyiv youth forum, '\u6211\u5011\u5fc5\u9808\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u500b\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u8b93\u4ed6\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u884c\u4f7f\u9019\u4e9b\u6b0a\u5229'.  Since Russia\u2019s full\u2011scale invasion on 24\u202fFebruary\u202f2022, 18\u201160\u2011year\u2011old men have generally been barred from leaving, with only limited exceptions such as having three or more minor children or a disabled child.  The military enlistment age is 25\u201160, and since July\u202f2024 all 18\u201160\u2011year\u2011old men must carry military registration documents when crossing borders or encountering police checks.  Eurostat data cited in the article show that as of June\u202f2025, about 4.3\u202fmillion Ukrainians live in EU member states, roughly 1\u202fmillion of whom are adult men.  In April\u202f2024 the government suspended consular services for overseas 18\u201160\u2011year\u2011old men, requiring them to return home to obtain passports and related documents.  President Zelensky reported in January\u202f2025 that Ukraine has about 880,000 soldiers deployed for defence and combat, while Russia\u2019s spring draft of 160,000 men is the largest since 2011.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 27, 2025 02:07 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/8/27/n14581907.htm)\n\n**Men 18\u201122 Travel Abroad Law: Everything About the Legislation**\nThe article reports on a Ukrainian parliamentary initiative, first discussed in July\u202f2025, to allow men aged 18\u201122 to travel abroad. Ruslan\u202fStefanchuk, the parliamentary speaker, explained that \"People 18 to 25 are not subject to mobilization, but they cannot exercise many of their rights\u2026\" (article). On 12\u202fAugust President Zelensky proposed simplifying border crossings for young Ukrainians, and on 18\u202fAugust Prime Minister Yulia\u202fSviridenko said that by 22\u202fAugust the Cabinet could adopt a decree permitting such travel, but instead the Cabinet submitted a draft law that would impose up to three years of imprisonment for attempted illegal border crossing and 3\u20115 years for conscripts, reservists or military personnel staying abroad during martial law (article). On 22\u202fAugust Sviridenko confirmed that the Cabinet was still considering the issue and consulting with the military, noting that \"This is regulated by a Cabinet decree and does not require changes to the law\u2026\" (article). Fedir\u202fVynyslavskyi, a member of the National Security Committee, said the decision would be taken by the Council instead of the Cabinet. Draft law No.\u202f13685 would allow men 18\u201122 to leave Ukraine freely without additional reasons such as study; it would enable all 22\u2011year\u2011old men to travel, while those turning 23 would be excluded. The current mobilization law exempts men under 25 from conscription, creating an \u201cabsurd situation\u201d where young people who left before adulthood fear returning (article). Ivan\u202fTymochko, head of the reserve forces council, emphasized that the initiative aims to communicate with youth and find legal ways to keep them in Ukraine, noting that 18\u201122 is a critical period for first higher\u2011education studies (article). Demographic data cited in the article show that, according to the UN, 5.6\u202fmillion Ukrainians were abroad as of 1\u202fJuly\u202f2025, and the National Bank of Ukraine forecasts that about 200\u202f000 will leave per year for the next two years, with a gradual return expected only in 2027 (article). Expert Elena\u202fLybanoeva warned that allowing 18\u201122\u2011year\u2011olds to travel could have negative consequences because there is no guarantee of return; she noted that mobilization age starts at 25 and expressed concern that young people may not return after studying or working abroad (article). The draft law has not yet passed its first reading, and its details remain unknown. The article also notes that, under current law, men 18\u201160 with deferment or exemption can travel abroad, but must possess military registration documents; since the start of 2025 the State Border Service has detained over 13\u202f000 people for attempted illegal border crossing (article).\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 01:55 PM\nSource:[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439](https://ua.korrespondent.net/articles/4810366-vyizd-za-kordon-cholovikiv-do-22-rokiv-vse-pro-zakon)\n\n**Men Under 24 May Be Allowed to Travel Abroad**\nA draft bill (\u2116\u202f13685) has been filed in the Verkhovna Rada to lift the travel ban on men under 24 who are not subject to conscription.  Currently, men aged 18\u201160 who are conscripted or called up are prohibited from leaving Ukraine, but those who are exempt from mobilization because they have not reached the conscription age of 25 are also barred from travel.  The bill would allow men who have not yet reached 25 to travel abroad, while keeping the ban for those who are 25 or older.  The proposal cites that many 18\u201125\u2011year\u2011olds who work or study abroad for more than three years cannot return, and that families sometimes send 17\u2011year\u2011olds abroad to avoid future travel restrictions.  Deputies argue the restriction creates \u201cserious obstacles\u201d for young people\u2019s return and \u201cprovokes attempts to circumvent the law.\u201d  They also note that the bill would not threaten Ukraine\u2019s defence readiness, and that it would preserve the current restriction for men who turn 25 in the current or following year.  The draft would amend Article\u202f6 of the Law on the Order of Exit and Entry of Ukrainian Citizens, adding a clause that temporarily limits exit rights for conscripts, reservists and those exempt from mobilization due to age.  The proposal also adds a phrase to Article\u202f11 that allows military personnel to leave on general terms unless otherwise specified by law.  The initiative follows a presidential decree by President Zelenskyy on allowing men under 22 to travel, but the related government resolution has not yet been tabled.  Prime Minister Yulia\u202fSviridenko says the issue is being processed together with the armed forces.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 11:31 AM\nSource:[dailylviv.com](https://dailylviv.com/news/sytuatsiyi-i-pryhody/cholovikam-do-24-rokiv-mozhut-dozvolyty-vyyizd-za-kordon-140074)\n\n**Traveling abroad during wartime: who are exempt from restrictions**\nDuring the state of war in Ukraine, military conscripts aged 18-60 are restricted from traveling abroad. However, there are exceptions for certain individuals, as defined by law. OBOZ.UA explains the details. In August 2025, the rules for men traveling abroad will remain unchanged. The list of categories allowed to temporarily leave Ukraine includes: individuals called up for mobilization, men deemed unfit for service due to health reasons, single parents of three or more children under 18, single fathers, men accompanying individuals with disabilities or those requiring constant care, individuals with minor children and a spouse serving in the military, men whose close relatives have been killed or gone missing during the war, and military personnel traveling abroad for treatment, rehabilitation, or training, as well as other categories specified in Article 23 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Mobilization Preparation and Mobilization'. The crossing of the border by men under 25 has changed. In late 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers updated the rules for men aged 18-25 who have signed a contract to serve in the Armed Forces or intelligence units of the Ministry of Defense but have not completed full-term military service (except for basic training). These individuals can cross the border if they have: a military unit or TCC document with information about the contract signing; and a military ID document confirming their service. The necessary documents for men traveling abroad include: a military ID document, which must be presented together with a passport, as well as: a disability certificate; documents for deferment; birth certificates for children; documents for education and other documents confirming the right to leave the country. The full list is specified in the Cabinet's Resolution No. 57 of January 27, 1995, taking into account the latest changes made during the state of war. Reasons for refusal to cross the border include: the absence of a military ID document; the lack of other documents confirming the right to leave the country; errors or discrepancies in the documents; and the individual being wanted. We remind you that the Verkhovna Rada is discussing an initiative that would allow military conscripts aged 18-24 to cross the border. However, it is too early to talk about any legislative norms. For now, it is unknown what the decision of the relevant committee of the VRU will be. As OBOZ.UA wrote earlier, Vladimir Zelensky stated that Ukraine is not considering demobilization of soldiers. In his words, defenders will return home after victory.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: July 20, 2025 08:55 AM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/novosti-obschestvo/viizd-za-kordon-pid-chas-voennogo-stanu-dlya-kogo-isnuyut-vinyatki.htm)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014diplomatic, legal, political science, and area studies\u2014the consensus is that the probability Ukraine will start revoking passports of at least 1,000 military draft-age men residing abroad before January 1, 2026, is low but not zero (estimates cluster at 7-8%, with one slightly lower at 3%). The experts agree Ukraine has ramped up administrative and bureaucratic pressures (such as suspending consular services and denying passport renewals) for noncompliant men abroad, but has so far avoided the much more drastic and controversial step of revoking already-issued passports. Key factors decreasing the likelihood include formidable legal and international law constraints (risking violations of conventions on statelessness and citizenship rights), stiff administrative and technical challenges, risk of severe diplomatic and reputational backlash (notably with EU and Western partners), and the lack of precedent for such actions among democracies or post-Soviet states facing conscription shortages. The base rate and historical pattern strongly favor continued use of indirect coercion, not mass revocation. Slight increases in probability are acknowledged only under scenarios of catastrophic military or political deterioration, where existential desperation could overcome these barriers, but no available credible reporting or government signaling indicates an imminent policy shift. Rumors of mass revocations are heavily amplified by Russian disinformation, not grounded in government announcements or legislative action. Experts consistently describe a 'no' scenario as one of continued and escalating administrative pressure with provision of services denied, while the 'yes' scenario requires an unlikely radical policy pivot triggered by extreme crisis. The time frame before the question closes (only about three months) further diminishes the likelihood of such a major new initiative.",
