Risks include last-minute field changes or damaging events, but present polling and institutional signals don't support a rapid reversal. Voter turnout among key demographics likely benefits Mamdani, and the fractured opposition is a structural advantage.

The base rate for the Democratic nominee in NYC is overwhelming, and Mamdani is leveraging a potent coalition among progressives and working-class/ethnic minority communities. The opposition is badly divided, and New York\u2019s FPTP (first-past-the-post) system punishes fragmented moderate/center-left opposition. None of the rival candidates shows strong coalition appeal or polling momentum. However, some headwinds exist: the late and incomplete rallying of the Democratic establishment around Mamdani, risks that a rival could withdraw/endorse creating a sudden anti-Mamdani coalition, and Mamdani\u2019s polarizing policy stances which could shift the narrative in the final weeks if exploited by rivals. Still, as polling, field dynamics, and demographic realities stand in mid-September, Mamdani enjoys a commanding position. Given continued polling leads, coalition fragmentation, and strong campaign infrastructure, but holding a discount for possible 'October surprises' or rapid realignment, the probability stands at 77%.",

While vulnerabilities remain (endorsement shortfalls, strong negative ads, and Gaza/Netanyahu controversy), there is no evidence thus far that these are eroding the large lead. The ballot structure further helps Mamdani. Late-stage realignment is possible, but practical and organizational barriers (strong egos, independent operator status of Cuomo/Adams, Republican Sliwa ceiling) make full consolidation highly unlikely. Therefore, I am confident, but not absolutely certain, that Mamdani will win; there is a 75-80% likelihood at present.

However, the New York City political opportunity structure currently presents an unusually open window for left insurgency (major establishment candidates wounded or fragmented, establishment resources divided, progressive organizational strength, and enthusiasm of base). The base rate for a Democratic nominee with ballot primacy is extremely high (>90%) in NYC; only extensive intra-party fracture or exceptional scandal has historically overcome it.

The persistent polling lead is valuable, but not so unassailable\u2014especially given the still-disjointed, but not immaterial, possibility of elite defection or a late, targeted mobilization among key anti-Mamdani segments (e.g., Orthodox Jewish, moderate Black, or older union voters). Second, identity politics yields high variance: the excited progressive base may not scale proportionally for general turnout, and backlash-mobilization on polarizing stances (especially if stoked by last-minute coordinated messaging) has a precedent of shifting several crucial percentage points in NYC history. The current absence of consolidating opposition is more contingent than you suggest, and even modest field realignment, or a sufficiently salient negative incident, could narrow Mamdani's lead considerably.

The consensus among experts across relevant disciplines (campaign, demographic, polling, historical, sociological, and identity politics) is robust: NYC\u2019s Democratic base rate and Mamdani\u2019s structural/polling advantages outweigh the plausible but so-far unmaterialized risks of late elite/field realignment or mass negative mobilization. While one or two forecasters used slightly higher probabilities (81\u201382%), critiques reminded us not to minimize tail risks from negative narrative shifts, demographic swing, or a last-minute coalition. There is widespread caution about overconfidence but alignment in the substantive assessment of the current odds. My own group critique confirmed for me that although Mamdani remains the strong favorite, the extraordinary field configuration and polarizing context merit prudent discounting and a buffer vs. historic base rates. Therefore, I maintain the forecast at 77%.",

Engagements in the deliberation phase reinforced how persistent uncertainties remain, given urban volatility, imperfect Democratic establishment unity, and the existence of plausible late-game realignment scenarios. Defenses of the consensus probability successfully highlight that risks exist (including shifts in identity coalitions, voter turnout shocks, and unpredictable narrative turns), meriting some discount from base-rate maximalism.

Critiques of my slightly more optimistic 81% highlighted, credibly, that NYC politics\u2014particularly when identity factors are highly salient and establishment unease persists\u2014merit a slightly larger discount for tail risks: particularly the possibility of a sudden, face-saving withdrawal or deal between Adams and Cuomo, escalation of identity-based controversies, or late elite coordination/endorsement shift. Additionally, statistical prudence recommends not straying well above consensus base-rate estimates (which are 75-78% for Democratic nominees in the rare, fragmented field scenario), given the novel mix of persistent non-GOP challengers, incomplete party unity, and live national/ethnic controversy. While none of these risks appears likely at present, a slight downward adjustment better reflects the aggregate historical precedent and the converging views of specialists in turnout, campaign strategy, and NYC political history.",

Critiques of more optimistic forecasts (over 80%) appropriately note the non-negligible risk of late field consolidation, elite defection, or issue-driven backlash (e.g., over Israel/Palestine or policing), which historically can move several points even in structurally lopsided races.

A Marist poll released on September\u202f16 shows Mamdani leading former Gov. Andrew\u202fCuomo by 21\u202fpercentage points in a four\u2011way race that also includes Republican nominee Curtis\u202fSliwa and Adams.

Jacobs said, 'Mr. Mamdani and I are in agreement that America's greatest problem is the continued growth of income disparity in our nation,' but added, 'On how to address it -- we fundamentally disagree.' He also criticized the \u2018fear mongering\u2019 around Mamdani\u2019s campaign and his views on Israel, stating that the Democratic Socialists of America does not represent the Democratic Party\u2019s principles. Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary in a surprise victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, has been a vocal critic of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and has threatened to order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visits the city. Jacobs\u2019 decision follows Governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s endorsement of Mamdani, who praised his \u2018can\u2011do spirit\u2019 while noting disagreements on policy. Neither Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Mamdani, despite meeting with him. New York State Senator Mike Gianaris called Jacobs\u2019 refusal to endorse \u2018disgraceful\u2019 in a post on X, questioning the party leader\u2019s role.

Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani earlier this week, but Schumer and Jeffries have yet to publicly endorse him. Liz Hohenberger of Our Revolution said the petition drive aims to \"over the line\" to secure endorsement: 'We're delivering over 85,000 petition signatures asking for Senator Schumer and Representative Jeffries to honor the primary elections and endorse the democratically elected nominee Zohran Mamdani for New\u202fYork City mayor.' Jeffries declined to comment, saying he would speak later. Schumer met with Mamdani last week and said, 'we had a very good conversation. We know each other well, and those conversations are continuing.' Polls show Mamdani with a double\u2011digit lead over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with the Republican candidate in third place and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams in fourth. The petition has drawn support from figures such as Alexandria Ocasio\u2011Cortez and Bernie Sanders, while others like Rep. Tom Suozzi oppose Mamdani: 'Sometimes change is more important than unity. And I think that the Democrats, we have to work on our brand. And I think that the message that Mr. Mamdani is standing for is not something that I agree with.' Trump criticized Hochul\u2019s endorsement on Truth Social, calling Mamdani a \"Liddle Communist\": 'Governor Kathy Hochul of New\u202fYork has endorsed the 'Liddle' Communist, Zohran Mamdani, running for Mayor of New\u202fYork.'

Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo are buried deeper down the ballot.

State Governor Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have endorsed Mamdani, giving him the backing of two of the state\u2019s most powerful Democrats. However, congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have been more cautious. Schumer said he met with Mamdani for a \u2018good conversation,\u2019 while Jeffries downplayed any concerns. Smikle, a longtime Democratic strategist, noted that \u2018the calculus for Hochul and Heastie\u2026is to find a way to embrace the movement he\u2019s created.\u2019 Hochul said, \u2018New York State and New York City are at our best when we stand together against those who attempt to tear us apart.\u2019 Heastie described Mamdani as an optimist promising a better direction for the city. Mamdani echoed the call for unity, saying, \u2018This is a time for unity. It is a time for strength, and it is a time to speak in one voice.\u2019 The article also mentions that the MTA lost nearly $1\u202fbillion in 2024 due to toll and fare evasion, and that Mamdani plans to make public transit free. With about a month and a half before Election Day, the endorsements and the poll suggest growing momentum for Mamdani, though key Democratic leaders remain hesitant.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 05:43 PM\nSource:[nbcconnecticut.com](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/politics/zohran-mamdani-new-york-democrats-chuck-schumer-hakeem-jeffries/3639539/)\n\n**NY Poll Monitor: What to Expect from the Zohran\u202fMamdani vs. Andrew\u202fCuomo Showdown**\nAccording to the article, the race for New\u202fYork City mayor is shaping up as one of the most intense political battles in recent years.

State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, who won the Democratic primary against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, issued a muted endorsement: 'The Democratic voters in the New York City primary made their choices. I respect their decisions and support the team of Zohran Mamdani for Mayor,' he said. 'Though Assemblyman Mamdani and I have some serious differences on certain policies, I look forward to working with him to help New York City succeed and thrive.' The endorsement appears to have prompted other establishment figures to follow suit. State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie is expected to back Mamdani this week, according to the New York Post. However, key progressive and moderate leaders\u2014House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u2014have declined to support the socialist candidate. The article notes that polls have Mamdani winning the race, even as his leading rivals, Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, have continued to downplay his margin of support.

A Data for Progress poll found that Democratic voters rate elected officials who describe themselves as democratic socialists about as positively as those who identify as Democrats, and that they prefer democratic socialism to capitalism when given written definitions. Nate\u202fSilver noted that Zohran\u202fMamdani\u2019s lead in the New\u202fYork City mayoral race is roughly 19 points \u2013 a margin that, given a 20\u2011point error range, gives him a 95\u202f% chance of winning. The report also reports that New\u202fYork City Mayor Kathy\u202fHochul\u2019s endorsement would pressure other high\u2011profile Democrats, such as House Minority Leader Hakeem\u202fJeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck\u202fSchumer, to support Mamdani. In Georgia, the governor announced plans to run, while in Kentucky a candidate from the Transwestern real\u2011estate firm is positioning himself as an outsider. The report cites a 53\u201147 loss for Trump in a recent primary, a 72\u201122 defeat for a Wisconsin governor, and a 42\u201116 loss for a long\u2011serving legislator in another state. In New\u202fJersey, Democratic nominee Mikie\u202fSherrill faces GOP nominee Jack\u202fCiattarelli in an upcoming debate. The report also includes a quote from a political commentator: 'Conservatives in Alabama do not believe that the people of California or Massachusetts should be allowed to make their own decisions about their children\u2019s education, or health care.' It highlights the crowded field in Connecticut\u2019s 1st District, where former Hartford Mayor Luke\u202fBronin has pledged to self\u2011fund $500,000, and notes that the state\u2019s ballot\u2011access rules could limit the number of signatures required. Finally, the report covers a Minnesota special election in District\u202f34B, where Democratic nominee Xp\u202fLee, a Hmong refugee, defeated Republican Ruth\u202fBittner 63\u201137 in the primary and faces her in the general election.

Trump answered a reporter\u2019s question with a firm \u2018No\u2019 when asked if he had urged any candidate to quit, but added that he would like to see two people leave the race so it becomes a one\u2011on\u2011one contest.

The November election, set for 4 November 2025, is shaping up as unusually competitive, with polls showing Mamdani leading but not dominating.

The current front-runner is Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old member of the New York State Assembly, who has been gaining ground on former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in recent polls. Mamdani, a Muslim candidate of Indian descent and Ugandan origin, is seen as a strong contender to become the first Muslim Mayor of New York City if he wins the primary election today. Mamdani represents the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which has been supportive of Palestine, while Cuomo represents the party's traditional wing and has been backed by pro-Israel lobbies. If Cuomo loses the primary election, he may run as an independent candidate in the general election on November 4. Current Mayor Eric Adams is not running in the primary election after facing criticism for his close ties to the Trump administration. The Republican Party has only one candidate, Curtis Sliwa, who is a radio host and the founder of the 'Guardian Angels' organization, which focuses on street safety. Sliwa is expected to face a strong Democratic opponent in the general election, given the city's demographics. In the primary election, voters can rank their top five choices, and if no candidate reaches 50% of the vote, the second-choice votes will be counted. Mamdani's campaign is seen as a strong contender in this system, especially if he can secure the second-choice votes of Brad Lander, another candidate.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 06:52 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/dunya/new-yorkta-demokrat-parti-belediye-baskan-adayi-icin-on-secim-yapiliyor/3611870)\n\n**From the vault: What burning questions do New Yorkers have for the next NYC mayor?**\nNew Yorkers were asked about their burning questions for the next city mayor ahead of the 2025 Democratic primary election mayoral debate.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that Zohran Mamdani is the strong favorite to be elected Mayor of New York City in the 2025 election. The main reasons cited across perspectives include his status as the Democratic nominee in a city with an overwhelming Democratic registration and base rate, his robust and consistent double-digit lead in all major polls, the high levels of enthusiasm and effective mobilization among progressives, younger, and minority voters, and the significant fragmentation of the opposition vote between Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams, and Curtis Sliwa, making it very difficult for any one rival to consolidate enough support to challenge him. Most experts estimate Mamdani's probability of victory at 77%, with the exception of two slightly higher forecasts (81% and 82%) from identity politics and urban machine experts, respectively.\n\nKey risk factors identified are: possible late withdrawal or consolidation among the opposition candidates (Cuomo and Adams) that could unify anti-Mamdani voters; lack of full establishment Democratic support (notably Schumer and Jeffries withholding endorsements); the potential for late-breaking scandals, negative campaigning, or external crises (particularly focused on Mamdani\u2019s foreign policy stances); and the historical volatility of polling with progressive/outsider candidates. However, these scenarios are considered low-probability given current polling, organizational, and field dynamics.\n\nThe consensus yes-scenario is that Mamdani retains his current polling lead, the opposition remains divided, and Democratic turnout patterns hold, resulting in his election by a comfortable margin. The consensus no-scenario would require a dramatic, unified anti-Mamdani push, a major scandal, or unprecedented turnout collapse among his supporters\u2014considered unlikely by all experts at this stage. In summary, the expert community sees Mamdani\u2019s election as highly probable given NYC\u2019s partisan baseline, fractured opposition, and polling, with only modest risk from extraordinary late developments.",
