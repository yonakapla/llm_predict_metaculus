However, such moves tend to fade fast unless continually re-ignited by new catalysts. The key question is whether, within 6 days, there will be another coordinated meme/short event sufficient to more than double the recent high (from ~$7.70 to $12). The base case for meme stocks with this much energy and short interest is that while another irrational spike cannot be ruled out, they typically need fresh and shocking news or viral momentum\u2014neither of which is visible materially in the current news cycle. Still, historical meme runs (GME, AMC, BBBY) show multi-day, unpredictable peaks well beyond any DCF logic. Factoring in the massive volatility, high beta, and the precedent of prior meme moves, I assess the risk as real, but still minority\u2014higher than the market or analyst consensus, but not the base case. I also weigh the DCF logic: fundamentals, dilution, and absence of institutional buyers sharply limit the plausible ceiling, but in the world of meme trading this can be temporarily overridden.

However, after peaking, BYND has already crashed back to $2.19, showing that such rallies are hard to sustain or relaunch unless there's a new catalyst.

Yet the presence of tail risk\u2014meme/short-squeeze recurrence\u2014cannot be dismissed, particularly given 2021 and current precedents. With just six days left, the likelihood of a transformational operational event is essentially zero, but the risk of a technical, sentiment-driven spike remains, albeit lessening with each post-rally day of falling price and fading hype.

Liquidity, participation, and short interest needed for an even larger spike are likely exhausted.

Current short interest remains extreme, and float is relatively small, enabling outsized mechanical squeezes. Fundamentals, consumer adoption, and analyst sentiment all imply deep structural weakness and no plausible 'organic' path to $12. However, the possibility of a violent, sentiment-driven, transient price super-spike cannot be discounted while meme fever, options market activity, and short covering can converge again. So, although the fundamental likelihood is near-zero, the \u2018meme spike\u2019 risk\u2014rendered real in October\u2014genuinely places the probability above the base rate for failing consumer brands. If there is no renewed viral squeeze event, the company will not naturally reach $12; if there is, any touch of $12 would be a pure technical flash event rather than a new sustainable level.

The entire point of these recent meme spikes\u2014BYND included\u2014is that they\u2019re disruptive precisely *because* they're irrational, emergent, unpredictable, and media-driven. History shows these moves can and do occur in rapid succession, often with even less narrative than the first squeeze: exhaustion fuels defiance, despair breeds 'hail Mary' momentum, and with short interest and beta this high, $12 is not mathematically out of reach. If we're using the logic of the disruptive innovation lens, the disruption here is not from Beyond Meat's burgers, but from retail traders upending price discovery rules. Three percent gives the market too much credit for learning its lesson; fat tails are fatter and dumber in meme land, and disruption is rarely so neatly priced."

Your call out of the 22% forecast as 'aggressively optimistic, bordering on wishcasting' is spot on: there's no precedent for a failed meme rocket being relaunched to all-time volatility highs in a week. Your 8% is bold enough to acknowledge meme tail risk, but conservative, evidence-based, and not deluded by post-squeeze gambler\u2019s fallacy.

You highlight that options expiry or end-of-month can be wildcards\u2014and history backs that. What dissenters miss: the logics of innovation disruption apply to trading mechanics, not just product launches. In meme stocks, volatility itself is the innovation. Your acknowledgment of technical triggers and meme mobilization as persistent wild cards is both accurate and underappreciated by those treating every move as a one-and-done anomaly. Yes, the probability should be low, but with this setup and the tiniest social spark, a freak rally isn\u2019t science fiction: 7% isn\u2019t wild, it's prudent in the new rules of market disruption."

You overstate the analogy between consumer adoption tail risk and meme rally recurrence: the innovation adoption S-curve is not the same as meme-stock volatility. In consumer studies, positive network effects drive repeated, stepwise surges; here, we're actually looking at collective 'attention abandonment' where every spent rally resets the social energy almost to zero. BYND already blew its viral stack with the influencer and Walmart, and meme traders notoriously move on fast after the bag-holders are left behind. Right now, the innovation is about how quickly attention *moves away*, not re-concentrates. Your 7% is more like the long-term tail of a struggling consumer product, not the ultra-short window of terminally exhausted meme price action. If any discipline should understand collapse after failed critical mass, it's consumer adoption theory\u2014you should be lower, closer to the reality of post-fad, post-pump brands."

Importantly, you recognize that food category narratives have a unique kind of fatigue\u2014the first squeeze already exhausted most hopeful triggers, and consumer adoption patterns don't support massive, sustainable bounces on mediocre retail news. The post-pump malaise is a real force that always drags meteoric runs back down, as we've seen with countless microcap packaged food implosions.

However, on further reflection, the lack of new catalysts, the magnitude of the required move (>5x from the latest $2.18 close to $12), extreme dilution just enacted, and the quick collapse after the first squeeze all make another run to $12 less likely than I initially accounted for. The base rate for double-meme-surge events in a single week is extremely low, and even GME/AMC required ongoing narrative fuel. While I still judge the risk materially above the strict fundamental value\u2014given meme market mechanics\u2014I am revising downward to better align with the balance of evidence and to recognize how exhausted the 'squeeze ammo' is for a 6-day window.

However, I stand by my initial figure. While it's higher than several peers, I do not see strong evidence to push further downward: short interest, meme market structure, option positioning, and precedent for secondary runs (however improbable) do support some residual fat-tail risk above 1\u20133%.

The best behavioral/consumer precedent is sub-5%. My field expertise as a packaged foods analyst already skewed me toward the lower (but not absolutely minimal) end, acknowledging nonzero tail risk.

General Motors (NYSE: GM) surged over 14% on Tuesday, rising more than 19% from last week, after reporting strong earnings that exceeded consensus estimates for both revenue and profit, with an impressive full-year profit outlook. Tigress Financial Partners reaffirmed a 'strong buy' rating and raised its 12-month target price to $92, citing GM's cash flow from its leading pickup truck and SUV portfolio, which is being used to accelerate revenue growth in software and services. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) saw a sharp 200%+ weekly gain despite a post-peak drop after a prior week of decline; the surge followed the company's announcement of an early settlement with bondholders, involving new shares and bonds, which triggered a short squeeze as retail investors bought shares, further fueled by news of a distribution deal with Walmart. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) fell over 12% on Thursday after a disappointing earnings report, with weak U.S. growth and a bearish outlook signaling declining demand for HOKA and UGG brands; Bernstein Global Group analyst Anisha Sharma downgraded the target price from $100 to $85 and maintained an 'underperform' rating, citing shrinking U.S. markets and compressed profit margins for both brands. Dow (NYSE: DOW) rose about 13% on Thursday and gained approximately 12.9% from last week after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, with EPS of ($0.19), beating the analyst forecast of ($0.31) by $0.12, though revenue of $9.97 billion fell short of the consensus $10.22 billion. Warner Bros.

Key stock movements included: General Motors (NYSE: GM) surged over 14% on Tuesday and is projected to rise more than 19% for the week following strong earnings, exceeding consensus revenue and profit estimates, with analysts praising its guidance and cash flow from its leading light truck and SUV portfolio, as well as growth in services and programs. Tigress Financial Partners reaffirmed its 'Strong Buy' rating and raised its 12-month price target to $92. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) saw a sharp decline after a strong Monday-Wednesday rally but ended the week up over 200%, driven by a debt restructuring deal involving new shares and bonds, increased retail investor buying, and a distribution deal with Walmart Stores. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) fell over 12% on Thursday after issuing weak guidance, with Bernstein SocGen analyst Anisha Sherman citing weaker U.S. demand for HOKA and UGG brands and margin pressure, lowering the price target to $85 from $100 and maintaining a 'Underperform' rating. Dow Inc. (NYSE: DOW) rose about 13% on Thursday and 12.9% for the week on a positive earnings report, with third-quarter EPS of -$0.19, beating estimates by $0.12, though revenue of $9.97 billion missed the $10.22 billion consensus. Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) rose this week after announcing a strategic review of alternatives, including continuing its planned split into two independent media companies by mid-2026, a full company sale, or separate deals for Warner Bros. and/or Discovery globally. The stock also benefited from reports of potential bidding interest from Netflix, Comcast, and Paramount Skydance.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 07:33 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Saudi Arabia](https://sa.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-3033583)\n\n**What's Fueling the Wild Swings in Meme Stock Beyond Meat (BYND)?**\nBeyond Meat (BYND) stock surged from $0.70 to over $7.00 in six days, driven by a meme stock rally and a new distribution deal with Walmart (WMT) to sell products in over 2,000 stores nationwide, expanding access to mainstream consumers. The rally reversed sharply, with shares dropping more than 20% on Thursday to close at $2.84, though they rose over 12% in pre-market trading on Friday. Despite the volatility, the company remains unprofitable, having never posted a yearly profit and continuing to burn cash. The broader plant-based meat market has slowed, adding pressure. A short squeeze likely amplified the price surge, as heavily shorted stocks rise rapidly, forcing short sellers to cover positions. Wall Street analysts maintain a Moderate Sell consensus, with five Sells and three Holds in the past three months. The average price target of $2.20 per share implies over 22% downside from the current level, indicating that the stock\u2019s movement remains speculative rather than grounded in fundamentals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/what-s-fueling-the-wild-swings-in-meme-stock-beyond-meat-bynd-1035424821)\n\n**Beyond Meat Stock Falls. Is the Meme-Fueled Rally Over?**\nBeyond Meat shares fell after initially surging, reaching an intraday high of $7.69 earlier in the week following a series of positive announcements. On October 13, 2025, the stock traded below $1 for the first time, signaling significant market distress. However, the company rebounded after announcing on Tuesday that it was expanding distribution to over 2,000 Walmart locations in the U.S., and on Thursday revealed that upscale grocer Erewhon would carry its latest Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef products. Beyond Meat was the first pure-play company dedicated to plant-based alternative meat to go public.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The stock rose as much as 112% on Wednesday, briefly exceeding $7, but ended down 1% to close at approximately $3.60. Despite the rally, the company remains fundamentally weak, having not posted a quarterly profit in over five years and facing sluggish sales of its plant-based products. The stock is still far below its 2019 peak of over $230. Analyst Mark Hackett of Nationwide noted that the Walmart deal served as a key catalyst, potentially boosting demand, but cautioned that the surge reflects 'emotions and technicals, versus fundamentals.' The broader market context includes concerns about a potential bubble in the AI sector and regulatory scrutiny over meme stock volatility, with the SEC warning of possible market manipulation. Calls for tighter rules on short selling and social media-driven trading have emerged, but no significant regulatory action has been taken.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 06:07 PM\nSource:[bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cew4kqg09j8o)\n\n**Five Stocks Capturing Retail Investors\u2019 Attention This Week: Tesla, Beyond Meat, Rigetti, IBM, and Amazon**\nFrom October 20 to October 24, 2025, retail investors focused on five stocks\u2014Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2014amid heightened discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets, driven by government shutdown speculation and AI-related enthusiasm. Tesla (TSLA) drew attention after Elon Musk threatened to resign as CEO following the rejection of his proposed $1 trillion compensation package, alongside updates on the 2026 Optimus V3 prototype, Cybercab production, robotaxi expansion in 8\u201310 U.S. cities by year-end, FSD v14 release, and a $900 million increase in AI/chip capital spending for 2025. Despite weak earnings, TSLA\u2019s stock rose 3.40% to close at $433.72 on Friday, up 14.35% year-to-date and 65.22% annually, with a 52-week range of $214.25 to $488.54. Beyond Meat (BYND) surged over 1,300% from its 52-week low, fueled by a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) distribution expansion, but fell 23.06% to close at $2.18 on Friday, down 43.25% year-to-date and 66.79% annually, with a 52-week range of $0.50 to $7.69. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) began the week bearish due to reports of U.S. government review on tech export restrictions and a Trump administration investment rumor, but reversed momentum after a report of a $10 million equity investment negotiation, though the U.S. Commerce Department denied it. RGTI closed Friday at $38.84, up 94.20% year-to-date and 2,489.33% annually, with a 52-week range of $1.06 to $58.15. IBM (IBM) gained visibility due to speculation about U.S. government investment in quantum computing firms, with analysts like Martin Shkreli and Jim Cramer favoring IBM over RGTI, IONQ, and QBTS. IBM closed Friday at $307.46, up 7.88% on the day and 39.79% year-to-date, with a 52-week range of $203.51 to $301.04. Amazon (AMZN) started the week with a major AWS outage due to DNS resolution issues, but later revealed plans to automate 75% of its U.S. business by 2033 using new Blue Jay systems, drawing criticism from Senator Bernie Sanders. Retail investors called for separating AMZN and AWS operations amid negative returns. AMZN closed Friday at $224.21, up 1.41% on the day and 1.81% year-to-date, with a 52-week range of $161.43 to $242.52. All five stocks were discussed in the context of meme-driven narratives, with S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq showing positive market movements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 08:15 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/48422931/5-ibm)\n\n**Beyond Meat is on a wild ride. Why you should think twice before taking a bite.**\nBeyond Meat Inc. (BYND) shares have surged up to 1,400% from their October 16, 2025 closing low of $0.52, driven by intense retail investor interest and social media buzz reminiscent of the 2021 meme-stock frenzy. The stock reached an intraday high of $7.69 on Wednesday, up 112.4%, but erased most gains, closing at $3.58\u2014still down over 50% from its rally peak. By Friday, shares had fallen further to $2.19 after three consecutive daily declines. Despite the rally, Beyond Meat remains far below its all-time high of $234.90 from July 2019, requiring a 9,800% increase to recover. The company has not reported an annual profit since May 2020 and continues to burn cash amid declining sales and stiff competition from Impossible Foods. Market research firm Circana reports that plant-based meats accounted for just 1% of U.S. meat sales in 2024, with declining household adoption and a $4.20 price gap between alternative and traditional meat. Wall Street remains skeptical: none of the eight analysts surveyed by FactSet are bullish, with five bearish and three neutral. Mizuho Securities analyst John Baumgartner cut his price target to $1.50, implying 37% downside. Positive catalysts include a debt-for-equity swap that improved the balance sheet (at the cost of shareholder dilution) and a Walmart partnership. However, the stock\u2019s recent surge is driven by short interest and speculative momentum, not fundamentals. As MarketWatch notes, while social media hype can fuel short-term gains, long-term success depends on strong financial performance, which Beyond Meat continues to lack.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 01:37 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20251025148/beyond-meat-is-on-a-wild-ride-why-you-should-think-twice-before-taking-a-bite)\n\n**Investing.com's Weekly Watchlist: GM Soars, Beyond Meat Surges on Short Squeeze, Deckers Falls on Weak Outlook**\nThe U.S. stock market declined on Wednesday due to investor concerns over U.S.-China trade relations, but is expected to close the week higher.

Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) saw a sharp 200%+ weekly gain despite a post-peak drop after a prior week of decline; the surge followed the company's announcement of an early settlement with bondholders, involving new shares and bonds, which triggered a short squeeze as retail investors bought shares, further fueled by news of a distribution deal with Walmart. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) fell over 12% on Thursday after a disappointing earnings report, with weak U.S. growth and a bearish outlook signaling declining demand for HOKA and UGG brands; Bernstein Global Group analyst Anisha Sharma downgraded the target price from $100 to $85 and maintained an 'underperform' rating, citing shrinking U.S. markets and compressed profit margins for both brands. Dow (NYSE: DOW) rose about 13% on Thursday and gained approximately 12.9% from last week after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, with EPS of ($0.19), beating the analyst forecast of ($0.31) by $0.12, though revenue of $9.97 billion fell short of the consensus $10.22 billion.

Despite the rally, the company remains fundamentally weak: it has never posted an annual profit, revenues have declined for three consecutive years, and consumer demand for plant-based meat has waned amid a shift toward less processed diets. In September, Beyond Meat executed a debt-for-equity swap to avoid default, significantly diluting existing shareholders, and announced layoffs and the hiring of a chief transformation officer. Analysts remain skeptical, noting that while the company has liquidity to survive for about a year, a real recovery requires stable sales, successful partnerships, and a profitable business model. The global refrigerated plant-based meat market has declined by double digits annually, undermining earlier projections of a $140 billion industry. Experts suggest Beyond Meat may need a more radical reset\u2014such as share buybacks, activist investment, or product line changes\u2014to move beyond the meme-driven rally and demonstrate sustainable growth.

The rollout includes a value-oriented 6-pack of the flagship Beyond Burger, as well as Beyond Chicken Pieces and Korean BBQ-Style Steak, targeting price-sensitive shoppers with a product offering that provides 21 grams of protein, no cholesterol, and only 2 grams of saturated fat per serving. The expansion aims to boost top-line growth and retail sell-through, potentially driving further share price gains. However, despite the rally\u2014up 350% in less than a week\u2014BYND remains a high-risk investment due to persistent cash burn, negative margins, lack of profitability, and intense competition in the plant-based meat sector. The stock\u2019s recent rise is attributed to a meme stock rally and short squeeze dynamics, which are inherently volatile and unsustainable.

The rally was driven by multiple factors: inclusion in the Roundhill Memes ETF (MEME) by Roundhill Investments, which led to significant fund inflows, and a major partnership with Walmart. FactSet data shows that over 63% of Beyond Meat\u2019s float was sold short, creating a highly leveraged short squeeze environment. As the stock rose, short sellers were forced to cover their positions, amplifying volatility. The company\u2019s announcement that Walmart would become one of the first national retailers to carry the new Beyond Burger 6 packaging\u2014offered in an economy-sized format\u2014was a key catalyst. This expanded distribution includes Beyond Burger 6, Beyond Chicken Nuggets, and Korean BBQ-flavored Beyond Steak, with plans to roll out across more than 2,000 Walmart stores nationwide. Industry analysts highlight three advantages from the Walmart deal: market channel expansion beyond premium retailers like Whole Foods, product line diversification, and a revised pricing strategy through economy packaging to improve cost efficiency. Founded by Ethan Brown in 2009 and listed on the Nasdaq in May 2019, Beyond Meat has struggled with profitability, reporting losses in nearly every quarter since its IPO, according to Wind data.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 10:34 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8ng1yFatRJg)\n\n**How Beyond Meat\u2019s Stock Soared 600% in 72 Hours: Rally or Speculative Hype?**\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) shares surged nearly 600% over three trading days from October 17 to October 21, 2025, rising from a historical low of $0.50 to $3.62, drawing widespread attention across financial markets. The rally followed a debt-for-equity exchange that diluted shareholders by over 300%, pushing the company to record lows. The dramatic price increase raises questions about whether it reflects genuine fundamental improvement or speculative hype driven by short squeezes and social media enthusiasm. Over 63% of the float was sold short, with trading volumes exceeding 1.2 billion shares on October 21 alone\u2014characteristic of a meme stock rally rather than a shift in business fundamentals. The surge was fueled by a confluence of technical and sentiment-driven catalysts: inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF on October 20 brought institutional inflows and momentum trader interest. On October 21, the company announced expanded distribution in over 2,000 Walmart stores for its Beyond Burger 6-pack and Beyond Chicken Pieces, providing a tangible business development that coincided with the speculative surge. Market microstructure played a key role: 39.59 million shares were sold short by late September (63.13% of float), up 26.65% from the previous month, creating conditions for a violent short squeeze as pessimistic investors rushed to cover. Options activity spiked to 15 times normal volume on October 21, with 74.49% of 2.53 million contracts being calls. Borrowing costs reached triple-digit annual rates by mid-October, making short positions prohibitively expensive. Social media amplification intensified the momentum, notably from Dubai-based trader Dimitri Semenikhin (\u2018Capybara Stocks\u2019), who bought ~4% of circulating shares and promoted a bullish thesis on Reddit and YouTube, arguing the debt exchange eliminated bankruptcy risk. Despite the rally, fundamentals remain weak: in Q2 2025, revenue was $75 million\u2014nearly 20% lower than the prior year\u2014with gross margins falling from 14.7% to 11.5%, driven by declining volumes and exit from China. The company reported a net loss of $29.2 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $22.1 million, reflecting broader industry slowdown in plant-based meats across U.S. retail and international foodservice. Beyond Meat also withdrew its full-year guidance and announced a 6% workforce reduction, signaling growing pressure. Revenue dropped from $465 million in 2021 to $326 million in 2024, while its balance sheet remains strained: $1.2 billion in debt against only $103.5 million in cash. Wall Street remains skeptical: of eight analysts covering the stock, five rate it \u2018sell\u2019 or \u2018strong sell,\u2019 with a median price target of $2.27\u2014over one-third below the October 21 close of $3.62.

The broader market context includes concerns about a potential bubble in the AI sector and regulatory scrutiny over meme stock volatility, with the SEC warning of possible market manipulation. Calls for tighter rules on short selling and social media-driven trading have emerged, but no significant regulatory action has been taken.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 06:07 PM\nSource:[bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cew4kqg09j8o)\n\n**How Did Beyond Meat Shares Surge 600% in 72 Hours: A Real Rally or Just Hype?**\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) shares surged nearly 600% over three trading sessions from October 17 to October 21, 2025, rising from a record low of $0.50 to $3.62, drawing renewed attention across retail brokerage platforms. The rally followed a debt-for-equity exchange that diluted shareholders by over 300%, pushing the stock to historic lows. The dramatic price increase was driven by a combination of technical and sentiment-based catalysts rather than operational improvements. On October 20, Beyond Meat was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, triggering institutional inflows and boosting visibility among momentum traders. On October 21, the company announced expanded distribution in over 2,000 Walmart stores nationwide for its Beyond Burger 6-pack and Beyond Chicken Pieces, aligning with the speculative surge. Market microstructure played a key role: by the end of September, 39.59 million shares were shorted\u201463.13% of float\u2014up 26.65% from the prior month. Short interest above 60% created conditions for a violent short squeeze as bearish investors rushed to cover positions amid rising prices. Options activity spiked to 15 times normal volume on October 21, with 74.49% of 2.53 million contracts being call options. High borrowing costs, reaching triple-digit annual rates in mid-October, made maintaining short positions unsustainable. Social media campaigns amplified momentum: Dubai-based trader Dimitri Semenikhin, known as 'Capybara Stocks,' claimed to have acquired approximately 4% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares and promoted a bullish thesis on Reddit and YouTube, asserting the debt exchange eliminated bankruptcy risk. However, fundamentals remain weak: net revenue fell to $75 million in Q2 2025, down nearly 20% year-on-year, with gross margins dropping to 11.5% from 14.7%. Sales volumes continued to decline, and the company exited China. It reported a net loss of $29.2 million and a adjusted EBITDA loss of $22.1 million. The company also lowered its full-year guidance and announced a 6% workforce reduction, signaling increasing pressure. Revenue has declined from $465 million in 2021 to $326 million in 2024, with $1.2 billion in debt against only $103.5 million in cash. Wall Street remains skeptical: of eight analysts covering the stock, five rate it a 'sell' or 'strong sell,' with a median price target of $2.27\u2014more than a third below the October 21 closing price of $3.62. TD Cowen recently cut its target to $0.80 from $2.00, warning the business faces an 'existential threat' if no changes occur.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 12:38 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/sv/nyheter/2025/10/22/hur-okade-beyond-meat-aktien-med-600-pa-72-timmar-riktigt-rally-eller-hype/)\n\n**Beyond Meat: Walmart Launch Paves Way for Broader Plant-Based Market Penetration | Investing.com ZA**\nBeyond Meat Inc.

This followed a prior 128% jump the day before, which was triggered by the company\u2019s conversion of approximately $1 billion in convertible debt into stock, significantly increasing liquidity and strengthening its balance sheet. The rally was further fueled by news that Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, is expanding Beyond Meat\u2019s distribution to over 2,000 stores nationwide. Walmart is also one of the first retailers to offer the new Beyond Burger six-pack, along with Beyond Chicken Pieces and Beyond Steak Korean BBQ-Style. Despite the stock\u2019s extraordinary volume\u2014over one billion shares traded\u2014analysts caution that the rally is speculative. Beyond Meat remains unprofitable, with declining revenue, and if this trend continues, the company could face bankruptcy, leading to a stock value of zero. The Motley Fool holds positions in and recommends Beyond Meat, citing its improved balance sheet and strategic retail expansion as positive signals, but acknowledges the long-term risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 09:46 PM\nSource:[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2025/10/21/beyond-meat-shares-surge/86821978007/)\n\n**Beyond Meat (BYND) Surges on Expanded Walmart Partnership**\nBeyond Meat (BYND) shares surged over 40% following the announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart, under which Beyond Meat products will be available in over 2,000 Walmart locations nationwide, including the exclusive launch of the Beyond Burger 6-Pack. The rally was primarily driven by a short squeeze triggered by a recent debt-for-equity swap, despite ongoing market skepticism and weak demand for plant-based alternatives. Financially, Beyond Meat reported $301.35 million in revenue with a three-year decline of 12.4%, operating margin of -53.04%, net margin of -50.97%, and a gross margin of 10.57%. The company\u2019s balance sheet shows strong liquidity (current ratio: 3.29, quick ratio: 2.07) but severe leverage concerns due to a negative debt-to-equity ratio of -1.9 and an Altman Z-Score of -2.57, indicating a high risk of bankruptcy within two years. Valuation metrics show a P/S ratio of 0.49, near a 10-year low, suggesting potential undervaluation, though analyst sentiment remains cautious with a hold recommendation. Institutional ownership is 44.57%, and insider ownership is 5.43%, with three insider sell transactions in the past three months. The stock\u2019s beta of 3.28 reflects high volatility, and sector risks include fluctuating consumer demand and intense competition in the consumer packaged goods industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 02:56 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3152468/beyond-meat-bynd-surges-on-expanded-walmart-partnership)\n\n**Beyond Meat stock soars after expanding Walmart distribution**\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock surged over 60% on October 21, 2025, following the company's announcement that it would expand distribution of select plant-based products to over 2,000 Walmart stores nationwide. The rally followed an 180% increase in shares over the prior three days, fueled by market speculation of a potential short squeeze. The expanded distribution includes three products: the Beyond Burger 6-Pack, Beyond Chicken Pieces, and Beyond Steak Korean BBQ-Style. According to Ethan Brown, founder and CEO of Beyond Meat, the company is 'proud to expand our distribution at Walmart' and emphasized the value pack\u2019s affordability and nutritional benefits, noting each serving delivers 21g of protein, no cholesterol, and only 2g of saturated fat from heart-healthy avocado oil. The fourth-generation Beyond Burger contains no GMOs or cholesterol, while the chicken and steak products offer 21g and 20g of protein per serving, respectively. The announcement marks a significant step in Beyond Meat\u2019s strategy to increase consumer access amid rising food prices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 01:52 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, forecasts converge on a very low probability that Beyond Meat will hit $12/share before November 1, 2025\u2014despite acknowledging rare but real tail risk scenarios. The most optimistic probability comes from the Equity Research (DCF) forecaster at 22%, citing the technical possibility of a meme-driven, short-squeeze super-spike but stressing the need for a new major catalyst, which none see as visible. Most other experts\u2014spanning equity analysis, industry research, financial economics, business strategy, and consumer studies\u2014anchor their forecasts in the 1-10% range (several at 7% or 8%), referencing the collapse after the recent squeeze ($0.65 to $7.69 to ~$2), the exhaustion of meme momentum, and the overwhelming headwinds from extreme dilution, business deterioration, negative analyst sentiment, and sector malaise. While all agree another technical blow-off is not impossible given precedents like GameStop or AMC, they uniformly emphasize that such second-wave explosive rallies are historically very rare, especially after an initial squeeze fails and in the absence of a new viral trigger. Scenarios that lead to a 'Yes' outcome almost always involve unpredictable, highly-coordinated retail buying campaigns or sudden, viral events. In contrast, 'No' scenarios reflect a return to fundamentals, meme fatigue, and the weight of dilution and weak sector dynamics. Probabilities span from a low of 1% (Industry/Plant-based Protein; Fundamental Analysis) to a high of 22% (Equity Research/DCF), with a consensus clustering around 3-10%. The group collectively judges the event as highly improbable but not categorically impossible, with the most significant risk coming from market microstructure anomalies rather than business fundamentals or innovation-driven surges.",
