My OSINT/standards lens gives considerable weight to the Ministry's historically conservative figures; union claims of 1 million almost never translate into matching official numbers. Base rate analysis indicates only rare events move the needle past 600,000. Unless a genuine shock arises\u2014a snap election, particularly draconian budget announcement, or violent police event\u2014the calendar, seasonal patterns, and protest fatigue all weigh against the probability of a qualifying mass protest.

However, two counterweights weigh heavily: (1) protest fatigue (after three rapid mobilizations); (2) the statistical conservatism of Interior Ministry counting\u2014meaning actual 'million person marches' are needed for a 600k official count. The next ~3 weeks are critical (budget deadline, possible no-confidence or dissolution). If a government move is seen as undemocratic or draconian, capacity for a one-off mega-protest remains real. Historic base rates suggest that, while rare, such events do cluster in crisis years. The odds have shifted from about 10-15% (normal baseline) to considerably higher due to current instability, but the question remains whether the movement can crest again in the short remaining window.

Yet, given the political volatility (unstable government, looming budget deadline), the organizing power of French unions, and the historical precedent for major surges when opportunity and outrage align, the chance of a massive upsurge before year's end remains real if a catalytic event occurs. Since the status quo alone makes another 600k protest somewhat unlikely, but an acute trigger could rapidly flip that calculus, my forecast must balance these. I weigh the base rate of giant officially-counted protests (uncommon), the clear but so-far insufficient 'routine' mobilization, and the heightened possibility of government 'error' catalyzing an escalation in the coming weeks.

The current situation is unusually volatile: five PMs in two years, palpable public anger, budget crisis, and a continued core grievance over austerity. The window (budget approval process in Oct\u2013Dec) is a classic protest trigger, and another government move toward 'unfair' cuts or procedural end-run (e.g., forcing through a budget with 49.3) could catalyze record turnout. The recent peak (500,000 MoI) suggests the 'floor' for mobilization is high. However, October 2 saw a substantial dip, suggesting some fatigue and no immediate trigger.

If any new government policy is perceived as an escalation or a symbolic fight, unions could rapidly remobilize even larger numbers than in September, and the historical and cultural context of French contention supports rapid turnout spikes. That said, the strong recent trend of declining participation, lack of upcoming scheduled demos, and some likely protest fatigue are significant headwinds. The risk of ad hoc escalation remains notable, but absent a major new trigger, inertia could dominate. I balance these perspectives and\u2014while not taking an extreme position due to declining recent numbers and protest fatigue\u2014assign a probability moderately above the base rate expectation for a protest of such size given the just-missed threshold, high organizational capacity, continued elite instability, and unresolved structural grievances.",

The 600,000 bar is difficult to clear, especially as the government is under extreme pressure and may attempt to de-escalate, at least short-term, with modest concessions. The window to mobilize above 600,000 is short and requires a catalyst: a major government provocation (like Article 49.3), an overwhelming sense of elite contempt, police violence, or fresh budget draconianism.

While resource mobilization theory rightly highlights the robust organizing infrastructure and latent protest capacity of French unions, it may overstate the readiness of those resources to activate at maximal scale absent an acute, widely-perceived injustice or state overreach. The peak of 500,000 (Ministry count) is not a trivial gap from 600,000\u2014especially as unions already poured considerable mobilizing energy into that September action, and momentum has since fallen sharply (195,000 on October 2). Your scenario seems to imply that another mass action of even greater scale is likely despite no new triggering event currently visible, and despite clear signals of protester fatigue and union leadership caution. Furthermore, the Ministry of the Interior's counting practices tend toward conservative estimates, even when union numbers soar beyond a million. While the risk is materially above baseline, a nearly 7-in-10 chance underplays the headwinds indicated by current open-source protest monitoring: absence of a fresh outrage, organizational exhaustion, lack of new protest dates, and the trend of declining turnouts. The pathway to 600,000+ may reopen with a government blunder or severe repression, but without one, recent history and OSINT standards suggest your estimate is too aggressive."

Crucially, you weigh both protest fatigue and France's unique mobilizational infrastructure, as well as the cultural norm of strategic rapid-scaling protests.

Resource Mobilization Theory cautions against treating current decline or absence of 'scheduled' escalation as determinative; French unions retain slack resources and mobilization capacity that can manifest rapidly when political opportunities surface\u2014especially in highly unstable environments. The marginal gap between the September peak (500,000) and the 600,000 threshold, when base rates and protest infrastructure are considered, suggests a relatively small event or new government provocation could tip mobilization over the line. Historical episodes (2010, 2023) show that after fatigue periods, grievance accumulation combined with catalytic policy shocks often result in turnout surges\u2014even if not pre-scheduled. Thus, your estimate may be too conservative, missing how resource-rich actors can quickly reverse turnout declines in volatile environments. You might consider more weight for the contingency of acute triggers within the short remaining window, especially amid institutional instability and deep-seated grievances."

While you emphasize declining momentum and protest fatigue, these risks may not outweigh the extreme volatility of the period, where even a minor procedural provocation (e.g., Article 49.3) or symbolic austerity move could trigger a swift and dramatic remobilization above the threshold. Where your reasoning is strongest is in recognizing that the risk is above long-term averages but short of certainty. Still, given the opportunity structure, I would argue for a more assertive probability\u2014on par or slightly above my own (45%)\u2014to reflect how such alignment of POS variables rarely persists for months without a mass mobilization spike."

The observation that previous peaks (e.g., 2010, 2023) were achieved under conditions quite similar to those today (elite delegitimization, mass grievances, leadership crisis) reinforces why a 600,000+ protest remains plausible, yet not a foregone conclusion. I also think your attention to the recent downturn in turnout, absence of immediate union escalation plans, and the short window left aligns with collective action theory's stress on the risk of demobilization. Importantly, you balance caution (no imminent scheduled mega-protest, protest fatigue) with the recognition that latent potential can be unleashed by a single unforeseen catalyst, which is a recurring motif in French protest cycles.

Your recognition that the recent 500,000 participant floor is itself indicative of crisis potential matches well with the idea that latent mobilization can become actualized rapidly if a procedural or substantive trigger arises. Unlike approaches overly anchored to mechanical trend lines or fatigue, your estimate (45%) successfully captures the depth of the current structural opening in the French opportunity field; this is what allows movements to 'flip' mobilization from moderate to historic in short order.

My critique of the highest estimate (68%) stands: while structural capacity is significant, the likelihood of activation at record scale absent a major new government provocation is low. No new intelligence or argument has emerged suggesting a material increase in the probability of a qualifying protest before 2026. However, reflecting on the Political Science (Political Opportunity Structure) and Sociology (Social Movement Theory) perspectives, which offer a slightly higher probability due to the ongoing triggers of parliamentary crisis and budget volatility, I see a minor case for a modest upward nudge: the risk of a sudden trigger in the next 2.5 months, while not dominant, is real and may have been slightly underweighted previously.

Importantly, no new or imminent political 'trigger' has appeared, and the continued protest momentum seems increasingly contingent on either a major government miscalculation or an unforeseen acute crisis. The critiques of higher forecasts, such as the 68% estimate, convincingly point out that the gap between 500k and 600k (by official count) is significant, not trivial. My original probability already reflected the system's volatility, and I now feel slightly more confident being a bit less aggressive.

My defense of the collective action theory perspective, which closely matched my own assessment, highlighted the importance of protest fatigue and the lack of scheduled large actions alongside the persistent risk of rapid escalation. Considering all updated perspectives, the probability for a 600k+ MoI-counted protest before 2026 remains notably above long-term French political norms, but not dramatically higher than my initial estimate. I see no compelling reason to move significantly; if anything, after hearing that even risk-modellers and POS theorists are staying below 50%, my forecast looks well-calibrated. I revise slightly down to acknowledge the broad consensus that the pathway to a qualifying protest is somewhat narrower than I initially weighted (violent repression or procedural outrage, but not simply ongoing political instability), and to further reflect how protest demobilization after October 2 is a strong headwind.",

At the same time, the defense of my initial perspective highlights that elite instability and volatile opportunity structures still hold open a path to an acute escalation with the right catalyst (government overreach, procedural outrage, sudden policy shock). While these factors mean the probability is well above normal background years, the lack of an immediate forecastable trigger, and persistent downward trend since September, suggests my initial estimate may slightly overstate the likelihood in the absence of a scheduled action or overt policy acceleration.

Importantly, no one compellingly argued for a substantially higher risk (except one outlier at 68%, who was effectively critiqued for overestimating the likelihood of a new mass surge absent a visible catalyst or union escalation strategies). Critiques highlighted that, while France retains latent protest capacity, protest fatigue and the absence of scheduled mass actions are real headwinds. However, the defense of the French Protest Culture perspective also validated my own view: protest dynamics in France can flip rapidly with a single catalytic event, and the alignment of opportunity structures is currently rare but volatile. Considering the strength of declining momentum, nonlinearity of protest cycles, and the risk that no acute shock will materialize, but also the very high readiness for escalation, I will slightly echo the consensus and edge my estimate down a touch to reflect the group\u2019s general midpoint and the current lack of a scheduled provocation.

The move, made following a meeting with centrist and left-wing parliamentary leaders at the Elys\u00e9e Palace\u2014excluding representatives from the right-wing 'National Rally' and left-wing 'La France Insoumise'\u2014was met with strong opposition, with both parties vowing to file a motion of no confidence. Lecornu must form a cabinet and present a new budget by Monday, or France risks another political crisis. Experts, including political analyst Maria Frolova and researcher Sergei Fedorov, argue the decision reflects Macron\u2019s limited options, with no viable alternative capable of forming a stable government. The crisis stems from a 5.4% GDP budget deficit and 114% debt-to-GDP ratio, with the government aiming to save \u20ac44 billion by cutting social spending while maintaining military spending at \u20ac70 billion by 2030. The previous government, led by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, collapsed after parliament rejected austerity measures, including freezing pension indexation and cutting public holidays. Lecornu\u2019s new government is seen as a stopgap, relying on potential compromises with the Socialist Party, which demands the reversal of pension reform.

Lecornu, in a social media statement, accepted the mission to deliver a budget and solve daily citizens' problems by year-end, emphasizing that stability and an end to political instability are essential for France's image and interests. However, the rapid reversal\u2014Lecornu resigned on Monday and was reappointed by Macron on Friday\u2014provoked strong criticism. Mathilde Panot of the far-left La France Insoumise (LFI) called it a moment of 'revulsion and anger,' accusing Macron of delaying the inevitable: his departure. She announced plans to submit a no-confidence motion and a proposal to remove Macron. Marine Tondelier of the Greens labeled the move 'incredible.' Fabien Roussel of the French Communist Party (PCF) denounced it as 'an unacceptable choice,' stating Macron is disconnected from the people and serving financial elites, calling for new elections. Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally (RN) described the appointment as a 'shame for democracy' and an 'insult to the French people,' pledging to support a no-confidence motion. Marine Le Pen also stated that the dissolution of Parliament is unavoidable. The political crisis followed the collapse of Michel Barnier's government on December 4, 2024, after a disagreement over the 2025 budget. Macron initially appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou on December 13, 2024, but Bayrou's government fell on September 8, 2025, after failing a confidence vote. Bayrou had proposed a 2026 budget with 4.3 billion euro in savings, including the removal of some public holidays, provoking public backlash. Lecornu, appointed on September 9, 2025, resigned the next day due to mounting criticism.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 03:52 AM\nSource:[TRT haber](https://www.trthaber.com/haber/dunya/macronun-istifa-eden-lecornuyu-yeniden-basbakan-atamasi-tepki-cekti-922420.html)\n\n**France's Political Crisis Worsens as Prime Minister Resigns Hours After Cabinet Announcement**\nFrance's political crisis deepened on October 10, 2025, when Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu resigned just 14 hours after announcing a new government cabinet, following strong opposition from his coalition partner, the conservative party Les R\u00e9publicains (LR). Lecornu, who had been in office since September 9, 2024, had unveiled a continuity government that included the return of former Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire to the Defense portfolio\u2014a move that angered LR, as its Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was not consulted. LR, a historically dominant right-wing party, rejected participation in the government, with leader Xavier Bertrand stating, 'We cannot participate in this government.' The political instability stems from the fragmented results of the 2024 legislative elections, which left the National Assembly without a majority, divided among three major blocs: left, center-right, and far-right. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella called for early elections, while left-wing deputy Mathilde Panot urged President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s removal, despite his term ending in 2027. Lecornu\u2019s government failed to secure parliamentary support, having rejected key Socialist Party demands such as a 2% wealth tax on the ultra-rich and reversing the controversial 2023 pension reform. His resignation comes amid ongoing protests by unions demanding greater 'fiscal justice' and pressure from financial markets to reduce public debt, which stood at 115.6% of GDP. His predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, had previously fallen after failing to pass a 2026 budget plan that included \u20ac44 billion in cuts and the elimination of two public holidays.

This marks the fifth prime minister to resign in less than two years, following Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, whose unpopular 44-billion-euro austerity budget led to a parliamentary vote of no confidence. Lecornu\u2019s brief term was defined by efforts to continue austerity policies. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s approval rating has plummeted to 17%, with 80% of French citizens expressing distrust in him. The country remains without a functioning budget. Political figures across the spectrum\u2014including Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of France Insoumise, Marine Le Pen of the National Rally, and leaders from the Communist Party and CGT union\u2014have called for either parliamentary dissolution, new elections, or Macron\u2019s resignation. The Communist Party advocated for a left-wing government through cohabitation, proposing a platform including a \u20ac100 immediate increase for workers and retirees, reversal of pension reforms, higher taxation on capital and high incomes, and a \u20ac100 billion fund for industry and public services. They warned that the National Rally, absent from social mobilizations, is not a viable alternative due to its xenophobic and racist platform. The CGT emphasized that Lecornu\u2019s resignation followed massive nationwide protests on September 10, 18, and October 2, driven by opposition to Macron\u2019s imposed pension reform and broader austerity measures. The union criticized Macron\u2019s use of Article 49.3 to bypass parliamentary vote, calling it a democratic failure. Meanwhile, France\u2019s public debt has surged to over \u20ac3.35 trillion\u2014114% of GDP\u2014and is projected to reach \u20ac107 billion annually in debt servicing by 2030. The crisis is further fueled by Macron\u2019s push for military rearmament and support for Ukraine, despite rising social unrest and economic strain.

The move, made following a meeting with centrist and left-wing parliamentary leaders at the Elys\u00e9e Palace\u2014excluding representatives from the right-wing 'National Rally' and left-wing 'La France Insoumise'\u2014was met with strong opposition, with both parties vowing to file a motion of no confidence. Lecornu must form a cabinet and present a new budget by Monday, or France risks another political crisis. Experts, including political analyst Maria Frolova and researcher Sergei Fedorov, argue the decision reflects Macron\u2019s limited options, with no viable alternative capable of forming a stable government. The crisis stems from a 5.4% GDP budget deficit and 114% debt-to-GDP ratio, with the government aiming to save \u20ac44 billion by cutting social spending while maintaining military spending at \u20ac70 billion by 2030. The previous government, led by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, collapsed after parliament rejected austerity measures, including freezing pension indexation and cutting public holidays. Lecornu\u2019s new government is seen as a stopgap, relying on potential compromises with the Socialist Party, which demands the reversal of pension reform. Analysts warn that failure to pass the budget could trigger the dissolution of Parliament, with Macron threatening to 'take responsibility' and call new elections. Without a new budget, France risks operating under temporary legislation, leading to fiscal instability, higher borrowing costs, and investor anxiety.

The Elys\u00e9e Palace announced the decision, citing Lecornu's commitment to 'duty' to ensure France has a budget by year-end and end the political crisis harming the country's image. Lecornu outlined key conditions for accepting the role: parliamentary debate on all issues discussed in recent consultations with party leaders, restoring budget balance, and forming a new cabinet reflecting 'renewal and diversity of competencies.' His urgent tasks include forming a government and submitting the 2026 budget to parliament by October 13. France faces severe economic challenges, with public debt exceeding 114% of GDP and a projected budget deficit of 5.4%. Lecornu\u2019s success depends on his ability to broker compromise in a deeply divided parliament to avoid a vote of no confidence and another crisis. Lecornu was first appointed Prime Minister on September 9, 2025, following the resignation of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou\u2019s government. He previously served as Minister of Defense. This marks the fifth government change in two years. On September 8, 2025, France\u2019s National Assembly passed a vote of no confidence against Bayrou with 364 votes in favor and 194 against, opposing Bayrou\u2019s austerity plans to reduce national debt.

According to the French Ministry of the Interior, approximately 195,000 people participated nationwide, with 24,000 in Paris. The CGT, France\u2019s largest union, estimated participation at 600,000 but acknowledged declining momentum, noting that the September 18 protest had drawn between 500,000 and 1 million demonstrators.

Despite a strike call, disruptions were limited: TGV trains and much of the Paris metro operated normally, though regional services (TER, RER, Intercit\u00e9s) experienced delays, and minor air travel issues occurred without major cancellations.

France\u2019s fiscal situation remains strained: the deficit reached 5.8% of GDP in 2024\u2014nearly double the EU\u2019s 3% limit\u2014and public debt stands at over 3.3 trillion euros, or 114% of GDP. According to French media, Lecornu is considering measures to ease living costs, such as tax reductions for low-income couples and reduced payroll burdens on overtime. Unions continue to pressure the government for concrete concessions, though no new national protest dates have been announced, with the possibility of future actions remaining open if the government proceeds with what they call 'unfair austerity measures'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 05:41 AM\nSource:[Euronews Espa\u00f1ol](http://es.euronews.com/2025/10/03/las-protestas-por-los-recortes-en-francia-pierden-fuelle-en-su-tercera-convocatoria)\n\n**Protesters in France Demonstrate Against Public Spending Cuts**\nThousands of protesters demonstrated across France in response to a call by unions demanding action against proposed public spending cuts for the next fiscal year. Unions are pressuring President Emmanuel Macron and new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu to reverse austerity plans, particularly after the previous Prime Minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, was ousted by Parliament over a proposed 44-billion-euro budget cut. Lecornu has pledged to break from those plans. At least 85,000 people participated in protests nationwide, according to the Interior Ministry, with students blocking school entrances in Paris and other schools being disrupted elsewhere. Around 76,000 police officers were deployed to maintain order. The government previously faced widespread strikes and protests in September 2024, when hundreds of thousands\u2014including teachers, metro workers, pharmacists, hospital staff, and students\u2014opposed the 2026 budget proposal. The French budget deficit reached 5.8% of GDP in 2024, nearly double the EU\u2019s 3% limit. Lecornu now faces the challenge of securing parliamentary support for the 2026 budget, requiring cooperation from the center-right and concessions to socialists, despite broad agreement on reducing the deficit but disagreement on methods.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:34 PM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/10/02/manifestantes-protestam-na-frana-contra-cortes-nos-gastos-pblicos.ghtml)\n\n**Hundreds of Thousands Protest in France Against Prime Minister Lecornu\u2019s 2026 Budget Plan**\nOn October 2, 2025, hundreds of thousands of people across France participated in a general strike and nationwide protests against the 2026 budget plan outlined by newly appointed Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu. According to government figures, approximately 195,000 people mobilized nationwide, including 24,000 in Paris, where 5,000 police officers were deployed. The CGT union reported nearly 600,000 participants, while student unions noted 80,000 youth demonstrators\u2014fewer than the 110,000 from the previous month\u2019s strike. Around 6% of the teaching staff joined the strike, marking a lower turnout than expected despite union efforts to pressure Lecornu ahead of his upcoming policy speech. CGT Secretary General Sophie Binet criticized Lecornu as a 'clone of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou' and affirmed that 'social outrage' in France is 'undeniable.' Lecornu had previously announced plans to cut \u20ac6 billion from state spending and target a public deficit of 4.7% of GDP by 2026, promising not to present an 'austerity and social regression budget,' though these proposals have failed to convince unions. This marked the third strike against Lecornu, who has opposed suspending the controversial pension reform passed by former Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. Unions continue demanding more generous pension measures and the reinstatement of the tax on large fortunes. Lecornu was appointed on September 9, 2025, following Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou\u2019s resignation after his confidence motion failed in the National Assembly due to a proposed \u20ac44 billion budget cut plan.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:39 PM\nSource:[Diario de Noticias](https://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/union-europea/2025/10/02/miles-personas-salen-calles-francia-10162118.html)\n\n**October 2 Gr\u00e8ve: Smaller Mobilization but Unchanged Anger Amid Lecornu's Budget Proposals**\nOn Thursday, October 2, 2025, a third nationwide mobilization in less than a month drew approximately 600,000 participants across France, according to the CGT, marking a slight decline from the 500,000 to 1 million demonstrators on September 18, 2025, during the 'Bloquons tout' movement. The protests, organized by the intersyndical coalition, demand the abandonment of the budget proposed by former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, which they describe as 'brutal' for workers, and call for greater social and fiscal justice. Despite the reduced turnout, union leaders emphasize that the sustained momentum\u2014three days of strikes and demonstrations in one month\u2014remains unprecedented, especially as Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu has faced three such actions since his appointment three weeks prior. Lecornu had previously met with union leaders on September 24, 2025, but left them dissatisfied, offering no clear budgetary direction. His recent announcements, including the reinstatement of the Macron bonus, tax reductions for couples slightly above the minimum wage, and inheritance aid, were dismissed by union leaders as 'distractions' and 'minor adjustments' that fail to address core issues like unemployment insurance, public aid to businesses, the 'white year' policy, pension reform, and public sector job cuts. Leaders such as Sophie Binet (CGT), Marylise L\u00e9on (CFDT), Fran\u00e7ois Hommeril (CFE-CGC), and Murielle Guilbert (Solidaires) criticized the measures as recycled right-wing policies lacking substance. Manon Aubry (La France Insoumise) condemned Lecornu\u2019s proposal to revive a controversial retirement reform for women, calling it unacceptable. Marine Tondelier (Ecologistes) accused Lecornu of using a 'chloroform strategy' to pacify protesters with superficial, ideologically conservative measures. Meanwhile, the Socialist Party, led by Olivier Faure, met with Lecornu on Friday, October 3, 2025, to discuss potential non-censure of their deputies, though Faure stated the proposals were 'very below expectations'\u2014yet he left the door open for further dialogue.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:31 PM\nSource:[L'Obs](https://www.nouvelobs.com/social/20251002.OBS108317/greve-du-2-octobre-face-au-budget-de-lecornu-une-troisieme-mobilisation-moindre-avec-la-meme-colere.html)\n\n**Why 500,000 French Protesters Took to the Streets: Targeting Macron and New PM Lecornu**\nOn 18 September 2025, France saw a nationwide wave of protests that drew an estimated 500,000 participants, according to the Interior Ministry, up from about 200,000 the previous week. The demonstrations, which took place in Paris, Lyon and Nantes, were organized by trade unions in response to the government\u2019s austerity plan proposed by former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou. The plan, amounting to 44\u202fbillion euros (\u2248NT$1.6\u202ftrillion), aimed to cut public spending and raise taxes on the wealthy, but was rejected in Parliament and led to Bayrou\u2019s resignation. President Emmanuel Macron subsequently appointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as the new prime minister.\n\nUnion leaders demanded the withdrawal of the budget cuts, increased public\u2011service spending and higher taxes on the rich.

I will tell Prime Minister Lecornu that the budget is not decided by the cabinet, but by the streets!\u2019). The protests were largely peaceful, but clashes occurred in the three cities. French police deployed 80,000 officers, riot units, drones and armored vehicles; over 300 people were arrested.\n\nLecornu, who had just taken office a week earlier, announced the scrapping of two national holidays and the curtailment of special privileges for former ministers, yet he has not fully abandoned Bayrou\u2019s austerity agenda. He pledged to negotiate with unions in the coming days but emphasized a willingness to seek \u2018compromise\u2019. The French Parliament remains fragmented, with no single bloc holding a majority, making the passage of a new 2026 budget difficult.\n\nProtesters also targeted President Macron, with a 36\u2011year\u2011old IT engineer Cyrielle stating, \u2018\u99ac\u514b\u5b8f\u7684\u7d93\u6fdf\u8207\u793e\u6703\u653f\u7b56\u6211\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u8a8d\u540c\uff0c\u767d\u80e1\u7684\u9810\u7b97\u4e5f\u4e00\u6a23\u7cdf\u7cd5\u3002\u6211\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u8cc7\u6e90\u6295\u5165\u516c\u5171\u670d\u52d9\u548c\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u8b93\u6709\u9322\u4eba\u591a\u5206\u64d4\u4e00\u4e9b\u3002\u2019 (\u2018I completely disagree with Macron\u2019s economic and social policies, and Bayrou\u2019s budget is equally bad.

Massive Protests Against France's Austerity**\nOn September 18, 2025, citizens across France staged a massive protest against the government's austerity measures, marking the second such demonstration since the 10th of the month and coinciding with a nationwide general strike. Major railway, health, education, and energy unions joined the action, declaring a joint action day that led to a large-scale strike. In Paris, thousands gathered at the Bastille Square and marched roughly 5\u202fkm through the city. The French government reported that about 60,000 people participated in Paris and over 500,000 nationwide, while the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) claimed about 1\u202fmillion participants. Interior Minister Bruno Le\u202fTaille announced that 309 protesters were detained and 26 police officers were injured during the crackdown. The protests were sparked by former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou\u2019s announcement on July\u202f7 of a 43.8\u202fbillion\u2011euro (\u2248\u202f71\u202ftrillion\u202fKRW) fiscal deficit cut for the next year\u2019s budget, which faced fierce opposition from the opposition and public opinion, ultimately leading to Bayrou\u2019s resignation in August following a vote of no confidence.

The CGT union claimed the turnout was \"more than a million\". The protest was part of a broader wave of demonstrations against President Emmanuel\u202fMacron\u2019s fiscal and social policies, which have sparked several protests since 2017. The former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois\u202fBayrou\u2019s 2026 budget plan had cut 44\u202f000\u202fmillion euros (US$51.9\u202fbillion) and eliminated two public holidays; the new plan will not include the holiday cuts. The demonstration was largely peaceful, but police and gendarmes deployed 80,000 officers, used tear gas in cities such as Paris, Nantes and Rennes, and detained 181 participants. In Paris, a group of demonstrators briefly entered the Ministry of Finance and urged the government to \"find the money where it is: in the pockets of the richest,\" as stated by Fabien\u202fVilledieu of the SUD\u202fRail union. The protest also called for the abolition of the 2023 pension reform, more public services, and the implementation of a \"Zucman tax\"\u2014a 2\u202f% annual levy on wealth above \u20ac100\u202fmillion (US$118\u202fmillion), which 86\u202f% of French citizens reportedly support. The article notes that the new budget must be presented by mid\u2011October amid a fiscal deficit of 5.8\u202f% of GDP and a public debt of 114\u202f%. The Fitch agency downgraded France\u2019s sovereign debt rating on the same day, adding pressure on the government. The piece concludes that the protests signal a clear warning to Lecornu and may intensify the political crisis and calls for Macron\u2019s resignation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:55 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/internacional/2025/09/18/medio-millon-de-personas-protestaron-en-francia-contra-el-plan-de-ajuste-del-nuevo-primer-ministro/)\n\n**Thousands Protest Against Austerity in France Amid Budget Controversy**\nThousands of French citizens gathered on Thursday, 18 September, in cities across France to protest against the government's austerity measures and demand higher taxation of the wealthy. The protest, organized by unions, aimed to pressure new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu to abandon the 2026 budget plan that proposes \u20ac44\u202fbillion in cuts and the removal of two public holidays. According to authorities, about 500\u202f000 people took part, while the CGT union claimed more than one million. Protesters cited the 86\u202f% support for a 'Zucman tax' that would levy 2\u202f% annually on assets over \u20ac100\u202fmillion. The day began with strikes and blockades of public transport and schools; more than 80\u202f000 police and gendarmes were deployed, and 181 people were detained by the Interior Ministry. A symbolic 20\u2011minute occupation of the Ministry of Finance was led by Fabien Villedieu of the SUD Rail union, who said the government should 'look for the money where it is: in the pockets of the rich'. Lecornu has rejected the Zucman tax but said he is 'willing' to discuss fiscal justice with unions. The crisis is intensified by Fitch's downgrade of France's sovereign debt rating and the rise in public discontent. The budget will be presented in mid\u2011October amid pressure to reduce the deficit and the debt, which stands at 114\u202f% of GDP.

The French Interior Ministry has cut that figure to 76,500. The strike has heavily disrupted urban transport; in Paris, all lines except the automated ones are closed, operating only during peak hours with a minimal service. According to the FSU\u2011SnuiPP, one\u2011third of teachers at the nursery and elementary levels are on strike. French intelligence services predict that the Thursday mobilisation will be larger than the September 10 event organised by the citizen movement \u201cBloqueemos todo.\u201d Early this morning, clashes between police and protesters were reported in Marseille and Paris, where students erected barricades made of urban furniture in front of university and high\u2011school entrances. Police recorded 63 blocking actions nationwide, including \u201csnail\u201d operations on southeastern highways to slow traffic. The protest was called after former Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou presented a budget cutting 44\u202fbillion euros and eliminating two public holidays. Following Bayrou\u2019s loss of a confidence motion, President Emmanuel Macron appointed Sebastian Lecornu as the new prime minister, who is still negotiating with parties to form a new government and draft a more consensual budget, but has yet to succeed.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 02:37 PM\nSource:[Acento](https://acento.com.do/rfi/francia-los-sindicatos-anuncian-400-000-manifestantes-contra-el-plan-de-recortes-9552282.html)\n\n**French Workers Strike Against Fiscal Austerity Plans**\nOn September 18\u202f2025, French unions mobilized up to 800,000 people in strikes across the country to protest austerity measures. They demanded the abandonment of budget cuts, more investment in public services, taxation of the wealthy, and the repeal of a pension reform that increased the retirement age. In a joint statement the unions called the fiscal measures \"'brutais'\" and \"'injustas'\". In Paris, several metro lines were suspended except during peak hours; students blocked school entrances; and traffic was reduced on a highway near Toulon. President Emmanuel Macron and new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu face pressure from parliament and investors concerned about France\u2019s deficit. The teachers\u2019 union FSU\u2011SNUipp reported that one in three primary teachers nationwide, nearly half in Paris, were on strike. EDF\u2019s nuclear production fell by 1.1\u202fGW at the start of the day. The pharmacists\u2019 union USPO found that 98\u202f% of pharmacies could close that day. The Interior Ministry deployed 80,000 police, including riot units, drones and armored vehicles, to monitor the demonstrations. The previous budget plan by former PM Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou called for a \u20ac44\u202fbillion adjustment; Bayrou was ousted by parliament last week. Lecornu signaled willingness to negotiate but has not detailed specific measures. France\u2019s last fiscal deficit was almost twice the EU 3\u202f% ceiling, heightening pressure for fiscal adjustments.

    "summary": "Forecasters from varied disciplinary backgrounds generally agree that while France is currently experiencing significant political instability and persistent large-scale protests, the probability of a political protest exceeding 600,000 participants (as officially counted by the Ministry of the Interior) before January 1, 2026, is moderate but not high. Most experts cite several key factors: 1) While the September 2025 protest nearly reached the threshold (500,000+), turnout has since declined significantly (195,000 in October), suggesting some protest fatigue and a waning of momentum. 2) French unions remain highly capable of mass mobilization, and the political environment is unusually volatile\u2014recent rapid government turnover, ongoing budget crises, and the possibility of further austerity shocks or government repression provide fertile conditions for a resurgence if a catalytic event were to occur (e.g., budget passage by decree, dissolution of parliament, or police violence). 3) The base rate for >600,000 MoI-reported protests is low in French history, typically only seen at the peak of acute crises (2010, 2023 pension protests), and Ministry of the Interior figures are reliably more conservative than union claims. 4) Imminent political calendar dates (budget deadlines, potential for snap elections) and the unprecedented political fragmentation may trigger a new wave, but absent such an escalation, the trend suggests mass protest turnout will likely remain below the target threshold. Most forecast probabilities lie in the 28-45% range, with one outlier as high as 68% (Resource Mobilization Theory) emphasizing the continued latent capacity for escalation, and a few closer to one-third probability, weighting recent declining mobilization and absence of a scheduled trigger more heavily. In sum: all forecasters recognize the high structural risk and potential for a rapid, high-turnout event, but the absence of a scheduled mass action and declining official counts result in moderate, not high, probability assessments for a 600,000+ protest before year's end.",
