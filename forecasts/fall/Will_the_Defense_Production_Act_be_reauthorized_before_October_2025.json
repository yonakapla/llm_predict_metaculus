However, my critique of the NationalSecurityPolicyContinuityOfGovernmentPlanning forecast confirms my view that a non-trivial risk persists: procedural bottlenecks, policy infighting, and the late-September crunch could still lead to a brief but technical lapse. While the operational incentives are sky-high, recent congressional performance makes me reluctant to move above 85%. The new information does not surface any materially increased risk, nor does it suggest the group is discounting true process threat. The consensus supports a high probability, and I see no reason to further revise upward or downward. My prior probability remains justified by both historical base rates and visible procedural danger: Congress could still miss the pre-October 1 deadline inadvertently. Therefore, no change.",

The critique of national security optimism bias is well-founded: even powerful statutes can slip through procedural cracks during especially contentious and overloaded legislative endgames. I initially accounted for this with only a modest discount, but given that every other must-pass deadline (CR, appropriations, social issue amendments) is converging in the same window, the odds of a brief technical lapse (even if rapidly fixed) are somewhat higher than my initial estimate. The operational impact might be trivial if backfilled, but for the strict resolution criteria, it's the pre-October 1 signature that matters.

The consensus across almost all forecasters is that substantive opposition to the DPA is almost non-existent; however, several emphasize the unique, measurable danger of a technical lapse purely due to procedural gridlock, stacked deadlines, and the possibility that a continuing resolution or NDAA standoff pushes all substantive packages past October 1. My original estimate was already notably high (93%), in line with the highest-end base rates but accounting for non-zero process risks. Given the new emphasis on procedural friction and endgame calendar chaos, a slight trim is warranted. I still assess the odds as very high\u2014well above 80%\u2014due to the law\u2019s institutional salience, elite consensus, and the multiple legislative vehicles in play.

Notably, the arguments by PoliticalSciencePunctuatedEquilibriumModel were critiqued for underestimating this process risk, and discussion consensus centered on increased gridlock and unpredictability rather than substantive opposition to the DPA itself. However, nobody presented a compelling case that the risk is drastically higher than initially assessed. The modal forecast clustered around 83\u201393%, supporting my positioning slightly below the upper bound.

However, these risks do not rise to the level of a true systemic punctuation or a plausible ultimate failure to reauthorize by the deadline, given the current salience of national security and procedural backup options.

The main risk is not substantive opposition but procedural malfunction or last-second standoffs. I also take seriously the critique that my legal institutional logic, while firmly grounded in precedent, underweights the elevated brittleness of modern Congress's capacity to act on time. Backfilling after a lapse is not at issue here; the question demands *on-time* (pre-October 1) resolution. Therefore, while I still see reauthorization as highly likely given the incentives, base rates, and status of the NDAA, the tails are fatter than a purely legal or historical reading would suggest. The probability should be marked down to account for a modest but meaningful risk of a brief technical lapse due to gridlock, process error, or unrelated disputes.",

Recent history (notably, the 1990-91 lapse) and current headlines suggest that intent and even strong consensus do not immunize against accidental, short-term lapses. These critiques argue convincingly for trimming back the base-rate optimism and properly accounting for the thickening risk premium on procedural grounds.

While my initial forecast was already embedding a modest haircut for these factors, I now see stronger justification for moving the needle further down, if only modestly. The modal expectation is still a late, but timely, reauthorization\u2014most likely in the NDAA or a minibus\u2014but the risk of a brief technical lapse (\u00e0 la 1990-91) is somewhat more tangible this year, given intensity of social policy disputes and overall legislative logjam.

Every time there has been a lapse, Congress has backfilled authority.\n\nTitle I prioritization powers under the DPA are used 300,000 times a year by the Department of Defense for \"[virtually all eligible contracts](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R43767)\", and was used in the procurement of the B-2 bomber, Air Force One, and MRAPs. DPA powers were also used in the execution of [Operation Warp Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed).\n\nThere is a [sunset provision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision#Federal_level) in the [previous re-authorization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5515/text) of the DPA (in the National Defense Authorization Act FY19), moving its expiry to **September 30, 2025**.

It cites the Army\u2019s 2022 recruitment shortfall of nearly 30,000 soldiers\u2014the worst in 50\u202fyears\u2014as evidence that DEI initiatives have eroded enlistment and morale. The author notes that the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cunconscious bias\u201d workshops and a 2022 Air Force goal to reduce white\u2011male applicants in the ROTC have further weakened the force. In contrast, the Trump administration\u2019s emphasis on a \u201cwar\u2011fighter culture\u201d has already produced results: the Army announced it had exceeded its 2025 recruitment goal and female enlistment surged. The piece calls for Congress to ban DEI offices, training, quotas, and data collection; to prohibit race and gender from academy admissions and promotions; to outlaw hormone therapy and sex\u2011change surgeries; and to remove \u201ccritical race theory\u201d and other radical ideologies from all military levels. It also demands symbolic changes such as banning drag shows, limiting social\u2011media use, and ensuring only official flags fly on bases.

The Senate still lacks confirmations for key positions such as the NLRB, EEOC, OSHA, WHD, and EBSA. A primary focus for the next weeks is extending federal funding beyond the September 30, 2025 deadline; Congress will be out the week beginning September 22, leaving only 12 legislative days, so a continuing resolution is the most likely solution to avoid a shutdown.\n\nOn September 4, 2025, the Trump administration released the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, outlining rule\u2011making for the next six months. The agenda does not include submissions from the EEOC or NLRB.\n\nThe Treasury issued guidance on the 'no tax on tips' provision of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Workers may deduct up to $25,000 in tips from taxable income per year through 2028 when tips are received by an individual in an occupation that customarily and regularly receives tips on or before December 31, 2024, as provided by the Secretary.

The bill cites a demand for AI GPUs that far exceeds supply, creating long wait times for U.S. customers, while chipmakers continue to ship components to embargoed or close\u2011tied countries, leaving the domestic market behind.  The proposal would establish a \u2018pre\u2011emptive right\u2019 for U.S. buyers and impose new export\u2011license conditions: no backlog of domestic orders, no preferential pricing or terms for foreign buyers, no internal supply delays, and guarantees that exports do not reduce U.S. production capacity.  Products covered would include NVIDIA\u2019s HGX H20 and H100, AMD\u2019s Instinct MI308, and potentially high\u2011end gaming GPUs such as the GeForce RTX 5090, which exceed the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s performance threshold of 4,800\u202fTFLOPS.  The debate is tied to the America\u2011First industrial strategy launched under the Trump administration; in August, Washington negotiated a 15\u202f% sales quota on H20 and MI308 chips sold to China in exchange for export licenses.  NVIDIA has reacted strongly, calling the proposal a \u201creplica of the controversial AI Diffusion Rule\u201d and a \u201cscience\u2011fiction\u2011catastrophic\u201d measure.  The company argues that international sales do not deplete U.S. resources but rather expand opportunities, and notes that H20 models destined for China use outdated technology that performs far below the Blackwell accelerators available in the U.S., thus not affecting the production capacity of the most demanded models.  Critics warn that the measure oversimplifies AI supply chains, which also depend on complex data\u2011center infrastructure, and that restricting exports could foster competitive alternatives in other countries, especially China.  The GAIN AI Act is not yet law; it must pass Congress and receive the President\u2019s signature.  The discussion pits national\u2011security advocates and domestic\u2011priority proponents against technology giants concerned about market freedom and U.S. leadership in AI.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 08:16 AM\nSource:[Hardware Upgrade - Il sito italiano sulla tecnologia](https://www.hwupgrade.it/news/skvideo/priorita-agli-acquirenti-americani-nuove-restrizioni-usa-sulle-gpu-per-intelligenza-artificiale_143009.html)\n\n**U.S. Congressman Proposes Bill to Produce 1\u202fMillion Drones a Year to Counter China and Russia**\nThe Epoch Times reports that U.S. Representative Pat Harrigan introduced the SkyFoundry Act of 2025, a bill that would establish a U.S.-led design, testing, and mass\u2011production pipeline for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

The House Homeland Security Committee advanced both bills during a markup session, but the deadline is tight. One bill, the Widespread Information Management for the Welfare of Infrastructure and Government (WIMWIG) Act, would extend the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 for ten years, until 2035, and add an AI provision and updated cross\u2011references for terms such as \u2018critical infrastructure\u2019 and \u2018Sector Risk Management Agency\u2019 while keeping the established list of 16 sectors. According to retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, \u2018The federal government needs to be able to collaborate closely and efficiently with the private sector to secure critical infrastructure against cyber actors attempting to preposition destructive capabilities in our systems.\u2019 He added, \u2018Core to collaboration is the ability to share information.\u2019 The second bill, the Protecting Information by Local Leaders for Agency Resilience Act (PILLAR), reauthorizes the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, which began in 2022 and earmarked $1\u202fbillion to state and local governments over the next four years to mitigate cyber risks. The PILLAR Act also includes an AI provision and prioritizes best practices such as multi\u2011factor authentication and secure\u2011by\u2011design software development. Mitch Herckis, global head of government affairs at Wiz, said, \u2018The PILLAR Act will help build efficiencies through shared services, ensure rural and underserved local governments are able to defend critical systems, replace outdated cybersecurity tools, and ensure more localities are well positioned to securely integrate emerging technologies.\u2019 The article notes that nearly 20 senior cybersecurity figures endorsed the WIMWIG proposal, and that the House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Andrew Garbarino described the reauthorization as essential for maintaining cyber resilience.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 12:01 AM\nSource:[TheRegister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/04/cyber_threat_intelsharing_funding_lifeline/)\n\n**Potential Outcomes If Congress Misses the Federal Funding Deadline**\nThe article explains that by October 1, 2025 Congress must decide how to fund the federal government for fiscal year 2026, or a partial shutdown could occur. It notes that there are 12 appropriation bills, each covering one or more agencies. To date, the Senate has passed only three bills \u2013 Agriculture; Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies; and the Legislative Branch \u2013 while the House has approved just two: Defense and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. With only a few weeks left, lawmakers are considering a continuing resolution (CR), a 'minibus' spending package, a shutdown, or a hybrid approach. A CR would keep agencies funded at prior\u2011year levels for a set period, whereas a minibus would bundle several bills for passage. A shutdown would furlough most employees, except those performing essential functions such as protecting life, property, and public safety. The article emphasizes that no savings accrue to taxpayers during a shutdown because furloughed employees receive backpay. It concludes that the most likely outcome is a CR followed by progress on the remaining bills, but the situation remains uncertain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 06:42 PM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/potential-outcomes-if-congress-misses-federal-funding-deadline)\n\n**September Energy, Sustainability, and Infrastructure Washington Update**\nThe Washington update reports that the Department of Energy (DOE) announced on August 13, 2025, notices of intent to issue four notice\u2011of\u2011funding\u2011opportunity (NOFO) packages totaling nearly $1\u202fbillion to advance critical\u2011minerals and rare\u2011earth supply\u2011chain technologies, using authorities from the Energy Act of 2020 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

The provision would allow the Secretary of Defense to intervene in the supply chain, provide funding for defense missions, and take ownership interests in private firms. Section 849A would differ from the DPA in several ways, including the transfer of program custodianship, tightening the statute's substantive reach, and erecting a statutory bar on spending in China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea. The provision would also impose no ceiling on funding, allowing Congress to supply as much money as needed. The Senate Armed Services Committee is acting now due to time pressure, operational urgency, the certainty and security of supply chains, and appropriations politics. The real strength of any military is measured not just in brigades, squadrons, and ships, but in the factories, foundries, and fabs that build and sustain them.

The DPA has evolved beyond its wartime origins and has been invoked over 100 times during the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize production of medical supplies, vaccines, and critical materials. In-house counsel must understand the DPA's scope, implications, and compliance requirements to prepare for potential involvement. The DPA grants the president three primary categories of authority, including prioritizing and allocating materials, expanding production, and gathering information. Companies subject to DPA orders must navigate complex compliance requirements, which can conflict with existing contractual obligations, antitrust laws, and international trade regulations. In-house counsel should take proactive steps to prepare for potential DPA involvement, including developing internal protocols, reviewing contracts, assessing supply chain vulnerability, monitoring government priorities, and coordinating with other legal areas.

He emphasized that the law remains vital to national defense by ensuring the private sector continues to produce goods and services the government may need during emergencies. Kendall also expressed concern about the level of cyberattacks affecting defense suppliers and is considering changes in contracting procedures to mitigate the risk of corporate espionage. 'Industry has no obligation to prioritize national security requirements,' he added, 'and at times, they're financially motivated to do otherwise.' He noted that financial incentives provided to U.S. industry reduce the likelihood of the government having to rely on foreign suppliers.

According to Reuters, Trump plans to invoke emergency powers to relax the requirements of the DPA. The DPA was established during the Korean War to increase steel production and gives the US President the authority to direct companies to prioritize production of materials necessary for national security. Trump previously invoked the DPA in March to promote domestic production of critical minerals used in computer chips, robots, and advanced weapons. However, the DPA has certain requirements, including congressional approval for projects over $50 million and a one-year deadline. Trump is expected to use an exception clause that allows him to bypass these requirements in emergency situations. This move is expected to be published in the Federal Register on June 4. Reuters notes that this move shows the White House's efforts to reorganize the critical minerals industry, which is dominated by China. China, which has a de facto monopoly on the global rare earth market, announced export controls on rare earths in April in response to Trump's trade war. Despite a Geneva agreement with the US, China has maintained its export controls and continues to exert its influence. According to Dr. John Paul Helveston, a professor at George Washington University, 'If the US wants to access critical minerals over the next 5-10 years, it needs to maintain trade relations with China.' He notes that investment in critical minerals is a long-term solution, but in the short term, the US remains vulnerable to China's trade policies.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 12:35 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250604036800009)\n\n**Exclusive-Trump set to waive Defense Production Act requirements to boost critical minerals**\nU.S. President Donald Trump is set to waive some requirements of the Defense Production Act, including congressional approval for larger projects, to boost domestic production of critical minerals and weapons.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is strong consensus that reauthorization of the Defense Production Act (DPA) before October 1, 2025, is highly likely but not guaranteed. Every expert emphasizes the DPA's centrality to U.S. national security, its bipartisan support, and historical patterns showing routine reauthorization\u2014almost always within the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) or a similar legislative vehicle. Most stress the 'must-pass' nature of the NDAA and institutional inertia which strongly support timely extension. Key risks cited include: intense partisan disputes over NDAA riders (especially related to social/culture-war issues), an extremely compressed 3-week legislative calendar with only about 12 session days, and the possibility of a government shutdown or reliance on a continuing resolution (CR) that does not include DPA language. All agree lapses have occurred in the past but were swiftly and retroactively remedied. Some note a minor uncertainty regarding proposed alternative DPA-like authorities for the Pentagon, but none believe these will substitute for extending the core DPA this cycle. The lowest probability given by the experts is 83%, with most clustering around 90-93% for on-time reauthorization. The predominant scenario is that Congress and the President complete legislative action\u2014most likely via the NDAA or, if needed, through a CR/minibus\u2014before the September 30 deadline. The only plausible 'No' outcome is a short technical lapse caused by unresolved gridlock or legislative delay, which has precedent but is considered unlikely given the stakes. Overall, the experts' consensus is a very strong likelihood of a Yes outcome, but not absolute certainty due to the process risks."
