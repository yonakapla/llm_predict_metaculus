The Katz case took years and involved factors (misconduct unrelated to protected speech) that are absent here. The overwhelming weight of evidence, legal inertia, and administrative caution point to a status quo hold. To the extent there\u2019s a plausible 'yes,' it\u2019s science fiction under the time constraints and real-world institutional limitations.

While a few forecasters treat institutional risk-taking as more likely because of recent right-wing activism or administrative CYA impulses, you rightly stick with multi-year norm-following, especially as real administrative innovation is vanishingly rare under direct legal threat. If anything, your sub-5% estimate could arguably be even more aggressive given the continued legal gridlock, but your caution is justified and your logic unassailable."

The collective argumentation reinforces that the factual and procedural barriers\u2014no fast-track proceedings, lack of precedent for purely speech-based tenure revocation, ongoing litigation by Wax, and the tight timeline\u2014are overwhelming.

The critiques of higher estimates (notably OrganizationalBehavior's 7%) are robust and persuasive, underscoring the institutional inertia and the lack of precursors for surprise late-term action. No relevant information has emerged to increase my sense of upside risk, and the main possibility for 'Yes' remains a pure black swan event\u2014now even less plausible as no one produced a plausible rapid-process scenario.

No one produced credible evidence of an accelerated process or plausible scenario for imminent loss of tenure in December 2025. Indeed, every additional perspective reinforced that the legal/administrative status quo will hold, and the only real variance in probability reflects speculative overestimation, not genuine risk.

Organizational isomorphism and cautious institutional behaviors further reinforce that innovation or surprise in this domain is extremely unlikely, especially with the specter of additional litigation.

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a decorated U.S. Navy veteran and former NASA astronaut, is under investigation by the Pentagon following a video in which he stated that military personnel can refuse illegal orders. The Department of Defense is reviewing 'serious allegations of misconduct' and has asked the Navy secretary to assess Kelly's comments for 'potentially unlawful conduct,' with the possibility of a court-martial. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has escalated the matter, calling for a review of Kelly\u2019s remarks. President Donald Trump responded with extreme rhetoric, accusing Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers of 'SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH,' and shared a post calling for their hanging. The FBI has also launched its own probe, seeking interviews with the lawmakers\u2014a highly unusual step. Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and John Curtis (R-Utah), publicly defended Kelly, with Murkowski calling the investigation 'frivolous' and criticizing the focus on a constitutional right to challenge unlawful orders. Curtis praised Kelly\u2019s service record as a combat naval aviator and astronaut, emphasizing his discipline and dedication. Kelly, appearing on ABC\u2019s 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' called Hegseth 'totally unqualified' and accused him of prioritizing the president over the Constitution. Despite the backlash, Kelly remains unyielding: 'I'm not backing down.' His remarks have elevated his profile within the Democratic Party, with speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run. The legal protection of the speech and debate clause of the U.S. Constitution may shield lawmakers from prosecution, but the political and institutional fallout continues. Trump\u2019s administration has pursued multiple critics through the DOJ, including recent criminal charges against three prominent opponents, though two cases were dismissed by a judge.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mark-kelly-trump-military_n_69270c07e4b063285311daed)\n\n**Trump's case against Senator Mark Kelly faces steep hurdles under military law**\nThe Trump administration's threat to recall Senator Mark Kelly to active Navy duty to prosecute him under military law for urging troops to disobey illegal orders faces significant legal hurdles, according to seven military law experts. Kelly, a former Navy pilot, and five other Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds released videos stating that servicemembers can and should refuse illegal orders\u2014a principle widely recognized in military law. The FBI and Department of Defense are investigating the videos, which Trump labeled 'dangerous' and 'seditious.' Experts, including Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor, and Geoffrey Corn, a law professor and Army veteran, stated that Kelly\u2019s statements did not violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), as they reiterated a well-established legal doctrine. A lengthy legal process must be followed before any charges can be brought: an initial investigation, a senior officer\u2019s review, a legal opinion, a military judge\u2019s preliminary hearing, and a convening authority\u2019s decision\u2014each layer acts as a safeguard against weak or politically motivated cases. Eugene Fidell, a Yale Law School professor, said the likelihood of the case gaining traction in the military justice system is 'essentially zero.' Even if charges proceeded, Kelly could invoke First Amendment protections, as his speech was factual and not inciting disobedience, and claim constitutional immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause. Additionally, concerns over 'unlawful command influence' are significant, given public statements by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accusing lawmakers of disloyalty. While precedent exists\u2014such as the 2016 conviction of retired Marine Staff Sergeant Steven Larrabee for a post-service sexual assault\u2014experts argue such cases are rare and require clear violations. The White House countered that Democrats are encouraging defiance of lawful orders, not just unlawful ones, and that such actions threaten national unity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 11:05 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/trump-s-case-against-senator-mark-kelly-faces-steep-hurdles-under-military-law-ce7d5ed2d180f723)\n\n**Indiana's Attack on Intellectual Diversity**\nIndiana's Act 202, framed as a measure to promote intellectual diversity, has led to the suspension of Indiana University (IU) Social Work professor Jessica Adams from teaching a course titled 'Diversity, Human Rights and Social Justice' after U.S. Senator Jim Banks objected to a chart in her class that listed 'Make America Great Again' as a slogan associated with covert white supremacy. Senator Banks claimed the content caused student discomfort and has no place in the classroom, but critics argue that such rhetoric belongs in academic discourse and that suppressing it undermines academic freedom. Act 202 does not authorize suspensions or censorship; it only permits institutions to refer complaints to trustees for consideration in tenure and promotion decisions and prohibits limiting faculty academic freedom. The suspension of Adams violates the law\u2019s explicit protection of faculty rights to teach, research, and publish on diversity, equity, and inclusion topics. The law\u2019s provision allowing punishment based on a trustee\u2019s subjective judgment that a professor is 'likely' to express unrelated political views\u2014without evidence\u2014creates a chilling effect and violates the First Amendment. This mechanism, rooted in David Horowitz\u2019s 2003 'Academic Bill of Rights' initiative, weaponizes the language of intellectual diversity to suppress left-leaning viewpoints. Organizations like Heterodox Academy warn that such broad, viewpoint-specific penalties erode academic freedom. The law undermines tenure by enabling post-tenure reviews by non-expert trustees, threatening shared governance. The suspension of Adams, occurring despite no due process and in violation of both the law and the Bill of Rights, exemplifies how the law is being misused to suppress controversial ideas. The broader threat lies not in opposing intellectual diversity, but in defending it from laws that cynically exploit its language to dismantle academic freedom. The situation reflects a growing climate of fear and silence in higher education, especially amid budget cuts and contingent faculty insecurity. Academic freedom is under greater threat when administrators exceed the law\u2019s limits and when intellectual diversity is weaponized to silence dissent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 09:39 AM\nSource:[Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/debatable-ideas/2025/11/26/indianas-attack-intellectual-diversity)\n\n**Fiscal\u00eda Questions Judge Peinado's Decision to Keep Madrid Government Delegate Imputed in G\u00f3mez Case**\nThe Spanish Attorney General has expressed 'perplexity' to Judge Juan Carlos Peinado regarding the continued imputation of Francisco Mart\u00edn Aguirre, the Delegate of the Government in Madrid, in the 'Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez case', while Judith Alexandra Gonz\u00e1lez, the former Secretary General of the Presidency, had her case dismissed. The prosecution argues that Mart\u00edn Aguirre's situation is 'identical' to Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s: same position held, no hierarchical relationship or dependency, and no incriminating evidence suggesting knowledge of wrongdoing. Mart\u00edn Aguirre served in the Presidency from July 2021 to March 2023\u2014during which time Cristina \u00c1lvarez, then Director of Programs at Moncloa, managed most of the private affairs related to the extraordinary chair at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) co-directed by the wife of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Despite this, the Fiscal\u00eda questions why Mart\u00edn Aguirre remains under investigation for embezzlement of public funds while Gonz\u00e1lez was freed. The prosecution states it 'does not understand the reasoning' behind the differing decisions. In its motion for reform, the Fiscal\u00eda also criticizes Judge Peinado for including a 'complaint' about the non-attendance of four still-investigated individuals at a November 16 hearing\u2014despite prior attendance\u2014and for highlighting their exercise of the right not to testify as a 'relevant milestone'. The Fiscal\u00eda argues this is merely the exercise of a legal right and should not be emphasized without stronger objective evidence. Additionally, the prosecution aligns with defense attorney Antonio Camacho in requesting the closure of proceedings against G\u00f3mez and the annulment of her case being sent to a jury trial\u2014previously unified by the Madrid Provincial Court\u2014for charges including influence trafficking, corruption in business, illegal appropriation, professional intrusion, and embezzlement. The Fiscal\u00eda also calls for the dismissal of charges against the Moncloa official and entrepreneur Juan Carlos Barrab\u00e9s, who is set to face a public trial on influence trafficking and corruption in the private sector.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 09:08 AM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/espana/fiscalia-reprocha-juez-peinado-que-delegado-gobierno-madrid-siga-imputado-causa-perplejidad_202511266926c3a96e5e5012dcce67fc.html)\n\n**Opinion | The Night the University Lost Its Voice**\nOn November 28, 2025, the Faculty of Law at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) experienced an event that raised serious concerns about academic freedom and intellectual pluralism.

The case centers on Professor Laura Murphy, a researcher at the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice (HKC), who led a series of reports from 2021 to 2023 exposing forced labor in China's supply chains, particularly involving Uyghur workers in Xinjiang. Her work gained international recognition and was cited by the UK Parliament and governments in Canada and Australia. In early 2025, upon returning from a position with the US Department of Homeland Security, Murphy found her research unit shut down. The university cited concerns over insurance, risks to staff in China and the UK, and potential 'conflicts of interest' in external activities. Internal documents revealed that China's Foreign Ministry labeled HKC as a 'front for anti-China forces' in 2022, followed by the blocking of the university's website in China, including its English language testing portal, hindering Chinese student applications. In 2024, university officials reported that the research had negatively impacted recruitment, with only 73 Chinese students admitted in the 2024/25 academic year\u2014down from 500 in 2018. In April 2024, three Chinese national security officials visited the university\u2019s China office, questioning staff in a threatening manner and demanding the cessation of research. A July 2024 internal email confirmed the website blockage was due to the HKC\u2019s research on Uyghur persecution. In September 2024, the university decided not to release the final report on forced labor and informed China\u2019s national security authorities, resulting in improved relations. A 2023 report naming a Hong Kong company, Smart Shirts Ltd., led to a defamation lawsuit; in December 2024, the High Court ruled the report 'defamatory' in a preliminary decision, and the university\u2019s insurer excluded related claims. After the documents were leaked to BBC and The Guardian, the university apologized, pledged to support Murphy\u2019s research, and affirmed its commitment to academic freedom under the 2023 Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act, which prohibits universities from restricting research based on country of origin. The university cited the inability to secure professional indemnity insurance as the reason for the shutdown. South Yorkshire Police referred the case to counter-terrorism units under Section 3 of the UK's National Security Act, which criminalizes assisting foreign intelligence agencies. The UK government stated that foreign interference in UK academia would not be tolerated and emphasized its updated national security powers. Professor Murphy remains deeply concerned about systemic underfunding making universities vulnerable to such pressures, noting there are 150,000 Chinese students in the UK.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 03:12 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/11/27/n14644479.htm)\n\n**'Seditious Six' Democrats Freak Out Over FBI Investigation**\nThe Trump administration has launched an FBI investigation into six Democratic lawmakers\u2014known as the 'Seditious Six'\u2014following a November 18 social-media video in which they advised U.S. service members they are obligated to follow lawful, not illegal, orders under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The video, featuring lawmakers with national security backgrounds, echoed Democratic criticisms of President Donald Trump\u2019s adherence to constitutional norms. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), a retired Navy commander, remains subject to UCMJ and may face disciplinary action; he directed Navy Secretary John Phelan to review Kelly\u2019s remarks by December 10. Hegseth labeled the video as 'despicable, reckless, and false,' claiming it undermines military discipline. Five of the six lawmakers are not under Department of Defense jurisdiction\u2014four are former military personnel not retired, and one is a CIA employee\u2014though Kelly, as a retired officer, remains subject to UCMJ. The FBI has contacted all six lawmakers for interviews, with Slotkin reporting outreach from the counterterrorism division. The four House members issued a joint statement: 'No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution.' Legal scholars note the case raises constitutional questions under Article I, which protects legislative speech, potentially requiring judicial interpretation to balance military conduct statutes with congressional speech protections. Republican lawmakers have reacted cautiously: Sen. John Curtis (R-UT) expressed personal respect for Kelly, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) called accusations of treason and sedition 'reckless and flat-out wrong.' On Truth Social, Trump condemned the lawmakers as engaging in 'SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!' and amplified a post calling for their hanging. The controversy coincides with scrutiny of Hegseth, whose authority is being overshadowed by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, and FBI Director Kash Patel, who faces criticism for deploying FBI tactical resources for personal security. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the allegations, stating she was in the Oval Office with Trump and the law enforcement team when the story was published. Despite political risks, Hegseth\u2019s stance may inadvertently boost Kelly\u2019s profile, who is viewed by some as a potential 2028 presidential contender. Several lawmakers, including Slotkin, have reported increased threats, with Slotkin now receiving Capitol Police protection. The investigation remains ongoing, with no official charges filed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 08:25 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/seditious-six-democrats-freak-out-over-fbi-investigation)\n\n**GOP Senators Defend Mark Kelly As Pentagon Ratchets Up Threats**\nSen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a decorated U.S. Navy veteran and former NASA astronaut, is under investigation by the Pentagon following a video in which he stated that military personnel can refuse illegal orders. The Department of Defense is reviewing 'serious allegations of misconduct' and has asked the Navy secretary to assess Kelly's comments for 'potentially unlawful conduct,' with the possibility of a court-martial. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has escalated the matter, calling for a review of Kelly\u2019s remarks. President Donald Trump responded with extreme rhetoric, accusing Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers of 'SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH,' and shared a post calling for their hanging. The FBI has also launched its own probe, seeking interviews with the lawmakers\u2014a highly unusual step. Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and John Curtis (R-Utah), publicly defended Kelly, with Murkowski calling the investigation 'frivolous' and criticizing the focus on a constitutional right to challenge unlawful orders. Curtis praised Kelly\u2019s service record as a combat naval aviator and astronaut, emphasizing his discipline and dedication. Kelly, appearing on ABC\u2019s 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' called Hegseth 'totally unqualified' and accused him of prioritizing the president over the Constitution. Despite the backlash, Kelly remains unyielding: 'I'm not backing down.' His remarks have elevated his profile within the Democratic Party, with speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run. The legal protection of the speech and debate clause of the U.S. Constitution may shield lawmakers from prosecution, but the political and institutional fallout continues. Trump\u2019s administration has pursued multiple critics through the DOJ, including recent criminal charges against three prominent opponents, though two cases were dismissed by a judge.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mark-kelly-trump-military_n_69270c07e4b063285311daed)\n\n**Hegseth Targets Senator Kelly Over 'Illegal Orders' Video, Weighs Military Prosecution**\nPete Hegseth, U.S. Secretary of Defense, has publicly criticized six Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Mark Kelly, for releasing a video urging military personnel to disobey illegal orders, calling them the 'Six Seditionists' and labeling their message as 'disgusting, reckless, and false.' Hegseth specifically targeted Kelly, a retired Navy captain, mocking his uniform photo and stating his conduct 'discredits the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.' Behind closed doors, Hegseth is evaluating potential punishments for Kelly, including reducing his retired rank and pension, or prosecuting him under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Unlike the other five lawmakers, Kelly is a retired military officer eligible for recall to active duty and thus subject to UCMJ restrictions on free speech. Legal experts warn that prosecuting a sitting senator under the UCMJ would be unprecedented, raising serious separation-of-powers concerns and constituting 'unlawful command influence,' as Hegseth\u2019s public statements may taint a fair trial. A coalition of retired military judges issued a rare joint statement condemning the Pentagon\u2019s move as partisan, legally unfounded, and tainted by unlawful command influence. While Hegseth cited multiple UCMJ provisions, experts note the legal basis is unclear and inconsistent. The Pentagon is conducting a 'review' rather than a formal investigation, with no involvement from military police. Hegseth has delegated the matter to the Secretary of the Navy, who must submit recommendations by December 10. Hegseth has hinted at administrative rank reduction, referring to Kelly as a 'retired Navy commander' below his actual rank of captain. The Pentagon has also referenced a WWII-era federal law prohibiting interference with military discipline, though it has not been used in modern times and is considered legally defunct. Other cited provisions relate to conduct that 'discredits' the armed forces. If prosecuted, Kelly\u2019s case would be handled by military judges, but Hegseth has reshaped the role of these judges, removing those who opposed his policies. Legal scholars argue that using the UCMJ to punish a senator for speech protected under the First Amendment would represent a major escalation. The UCMJ allows prosecution of retired service members, but its restrictions on free speech are widely seen as unconstitutional for civilians. Kelly has defiantly responded, stating he will not be intimidated or silenced by those prioritizing power over constitutional protection. The video in question urged military and intelligence personnel to reject illegal orders, referencing concerns over U.S. military actions in the Caribbean and troop deployments in cities despite governor opposition. The Trump administration labeled the video as 'seditious behavior at the highest level.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 01:16 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/hegseth-centra-posibles-castigos-senador-131645611.html)\n\n**Trump's case against Senator Mark Kelly faces steep hurdles under military law**\nThe Trump administration's threat to recall Senator Mark Kelly to active Navy duty to prosecute him under military law for urging troops to disobey illegal orders faces significant legal hurdles, according to seven military law experts. Kelly, a former Navy pilot, and five other Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds released videos stating that servicemembers can and should refuse illegal orders\u2014a principle widely recognized in military law. The FBI and Department of Defense are investigating the videos, which Trump labeled 'dangerous' and 'seditious.' Experts, including Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor, and Geoffrey Corn, a law professor and Army veteran, stated that Kelly\u2019s statements did not violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), as they reiterated a well-established legal doctrine. A lengthy legal process must be followed before any charges can be brought: an initial investigation, a senior officer\u2019s review, a legal opinion, a military judge\u2019s preliminary hearing, and a convening authority\u2019s decision\u2014each layer acts as a safeguard against weak or politically motivated cases. Eugene Fidell, a Yale Law School professor, said the likelihood of the case gaining traction in the military justice system is 'essentially zero.' Even if charges proceeded, Kelly could invoke First Amendment protections, as his speech was factual and not inciting disobedience, and claim constitutional immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause. Additionally, concerns over 'unlawful command influence' are significant, given public statements by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accusing lawmakers of disloyalty. While precedent exists\u2014such as the 2016 conviction of retired Marine Staff Sergeant Steven Larrabee for a post-service sexual assault\u2014experts argue such cases are rare and require clear violations. The White House countered that Democrats are encouraging defiance of lawful orders, not just unlawful ones, and that such actions threaten national unity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 11:05 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/trump-s-case-against-senator-mark-kelly-faces-steep-hurdles-under-military-law-ce7d5ed2d180f723)\n\n**Faculty reaches settlement with UPEI over workplace misconduct report | CBC News**\nThe UPEI Faculty Association has reached a settlement with the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI) over a 2023 grievance alleging violations of the collective agreement due to the university's failure to ensure the health and safety of its academic staff. As part of the settlement, UPEI admitted it violated the collective agreement and the P.E.I. Occupational Health and Safety Act, a significant acknowledgment according to Margot Rejskind, executive director of the faculty association. The dispute arose after UPEI released a redacted version of a third-party report by Rubin Thomlinson, which concluded that the university 'failed to create a safe, respectful, and positive environment for working and learning' and revealed systemic issues including workplace harassment, inadequate investigations, and a focus on reputation over staff well-being. UPEI initially challenged the release of a less-redacted version through a judicial review petition to the Supreme Court of P.E.I., but abandoned the appeal as part of the settlement. The updated report, published in September 2025, includes direct quotes from staff such as one stating that HR policies are used to 'smooth and shush over situations' and another accusing UPEI and its Board of Governors of prioritizing reputation over community safety. Rejskind criticized UPEI\u2019s two-year legal fight and significant legal costs to withhold the comments, calling the redactions embarrassing and unjustified. UPEI has since established an Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Human Rights (EDIHR) department, but its former director, Sobia Ali-Faisal, claims the university is moving backward and that initial momentum for change has dissipated. UPEI maintains it is on track with a six-year action plan, citing policy revisions, leadership changes, and an expanded EDIHR team of eight staff, and reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and meaningful action. CBC News requested an interview with UPEI but received no response, only a reference to a September 16, 2025, news release.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-faculty-reaches-settlement-with-upei-over-workplace-misconduct-report-9.6992323)\n\n**Indiana's Attack on Intellectual Diversity**\nIndiana's Act 202, framed as a measure to promote intellectual diversity, has led to the suspension of Indiana University (IU) Social Work professor Jessica Adams from teaching a course titled 'Diversity, Human Rights and Social Justice' after U.S. Senator Jim Banks objected to a chart in her class that listed 'Make America Great Again' as a slogan associated with covert white supremacy. Senator Banks claimed the content caused student discomfort and has no place in the classroom, but critics argue that such rhetoric belongs in academic discourse and that suppressing it undermines academic freedom. Act 202 does not authorize suspensions or censorship; it only permits institutions to refer complaints to trustees for consideration in tenure and promotion decisions and prohibits limiting faculty academic freedom. The suspension of Adams violates the law\u2019s explicit protection of faculty rights to teach, research, and publish on diversity, equity, and inclusion topics. The law\u2019s provision allowing punishment based on a trustee\u2019s subjective judgment that a professor is 'likely' to express unrelated political views\u2014without evidence\u2014creates a chilling effect and violates the First Amendment. This mechanism, rooted in David Horowitz\u2019s 2003 'Academic Bill of Rights' initiative, weaponizes the language of intellectual diversity to suppress left-leaning viewpoints. Organizations like Heterodox Academy warn that such broad, viewpoint-specific penalties erode academic freedom. The law undermines tenure by enabling post-tenure reviews by non-expert trustees, threatening shared governance. The suspension of Adams, occurring despite no due process and in violation of both the law and the Bill of Rights, exemplifies how the law is being misused to suppress controversial ideas. The broader threat lies not in opposing intellectual diversity, but in defending it from laws that cynically exploit its language to dismantle academic freedom. The situation reflects a growing climate of fear and silence in higher education, especially amid budget cuts and contingent faculty insecurity. Academic freedom is under greater threat when administrators exceed the law\u2019s limits and when intellectual diversity is weaponized to silence dissent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 09:39 AM\nSource:[Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/debatable-ideas/2025/11/26/indianas-attack-intellectual-diversity)\n\n**Fiscal\u00eda Questions Judge Peinado's Decision to Keep Madrid Government Delegate Imputed in G\u00f3mez Case**\nThe Spanish Attorney General has expressed 'perplexity' to Judge Juan Carlos Peinado regarding the continued imputation of Francisco Mart\u00edn Aguirre, the Delegate of the Government in Madrid, in the 'Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez case', while Judith Alexandra Gonz\u00e1lez, the former Secretary General of the Presidency, had her case dismissed. The prosecution argues that Mart\u00edn Aguirre's situation is 'identical' to Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s: same position held, no hierarchical relationship or dependency, and no incriminating evidence suggesting knowledge of wrongdoing. Mart\u00edn Aguirre served in the Presidency from July 2021 to March 2023\u2014during which time Cristina \u00c1lvarez, then Director of Programs at Moncloa, managed most of the private affairs related to the extraordinary chair at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) co-directed by the wife of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Despite this, the Fiscal\u00eda questions why Mart\u00edn Aguirre remains under investigation for embezzlement of public funds while Gonz\u00e1lez was freed. The prosecution states it 'does not understand the reasoning' behind the differing decisions. In its motion for reform, the Fiscal\u00eda also criticizes Judge Peinado for including a 'complaint' about the non-attendance of four still-investigated individuals at a November 16 hearing\u2014despite prior attendance\u2014and for highlighting their exercise of the right not to testify as a 'relevant milestone'. The Fiscal\u00eda argues this is merely the exercise of a legal right and should not be emphasized without stronger objective evidence. Additionally, the prosecution aligns with defense attorney Antonio Camacho in requesting the closure of proceedings against G\u00f3mez and the annulment of her case being sent to a jury trial\u2014previously unified by the Madrid Provincial Court\u2014for charges including influence trafficking, corruption in business, illegal appropriation, professional intrusion, and embezzlement.

Behind closed doors, Hegseth is considering severe punishments for Kelly, including reducing his rank and pension, or prosecuting him under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), according to a source. Unlike the other five lawmakers, Kelly is a military retiree, making him subject to the UCMJ\u2019s free speech restrictions and eligible for recall to active duty. Legal experts warn that prosecuting a sitting senator under the UCMJ would raise unprecedented separation-of-powers concerns and is likely unconstitutional, especially given Hegseth\u2019s public statements, which constitute 'unlawful command influence' and undermine the fairness of any trial. A coalition of former military judge advocates has issued a joint statement condemning the Pentagon\u2019s actions as partisan, legally baseless, and compromised by unlawful command influence.

Hegseth has hinted at administrative rank reduction, referring to Kelly as a 'retired Navy Commander'\u2014below his actual rank of captain. The administration has cited a WWII-era federal law and UCMJ provisions on 'discredit' and 'good order' as potential legal grounds, though these are widely considered outdated or inapplicable.

The lawsuit claims Penn failed to follow required procedural safeguards in its disciplinary process, including denying Wax the right to cross-examine witnesses, failing to provide clear and convincing evidence, and not properly disclosing key facts. It further asserts that the university violated contractual protections of academic freedom by revoking her named chair and reducing her salary after her op-eds and podcast appearances. This case follows a prior federal lawsuit dismissed earlier in 2025, which alleged racial discrimination in the disciplinary process; the court ruled the claims implausible due to lack of evidence. Wax has appealed that decision. The new lawsuit does not center on race but on breach of contract, academic freedom violations, and procedural unfairness. A five-member faculty panel previously held a three-day hearing in 2023 and unanimously determined that Wax committed a 'major infraction' by making 'derogatory generalizations' about multiple groups. Wax is currently suspended and receiving only half her salary. She is seeking a declaration of contract breach, reversal of sanctions, damages for lost wages and benefits, and attorneys' fees.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 05:02 AM\nSource:[The College Fix](https://www.thecollegefix.com/penn-faces-second-lawsuit-from-amy-wax-over-sanctions-for-public-comments/)\n\n**Professor sues Millsaps College after being fired for 'racist fascist country' email | The College Fix**\nFormer Millsaps College Professor James Bowley is suing the institution after being terminated in September 2025, alleging his firing for describing the United States as a 'racist fascist country' in an email to three students following the 2024 presidential election constitutes censorship and a violation of his tenure and academic freedom. Bowley, who taught politics and religion for over 20 years, claims the email\u2014sent to a political seminar group\u2014was rooted in compassion for students' emotional distress after Donald Trump\u2019s election and was part of a broader context of campus tension, including a threatening YikYak post targeting Kamala Harris voters. The lawsuit argues that Millsaps College, a Methodist institution, violated its foundational commitment to free speech, citing John Wesley\u2019s principle of 'think and let think' and the Church\u2019s policy requiring academic freedom and open inquiry. College spokesperson Joey Lee stated that Millsaps is 'confident' in its legal position and will defend its actions, though it declined to provide further details due to pending litigation. Bowley was placed on administrative leave in November 2024 and formally terminated nearly a year later, contradicting earlier reports that he was fired in January 2025. The complaint asserts that expressing unpopular political views is not grounds for dismissal. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) supported Bowley\u2019s position, stating he was 'well within his right' to express his opinion.

While Eisgruber acknowledges the need for civility norms in universities and admits that some academic disciplines suffer from left-wing bias, he dismisses survey data from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) showing that 80% of college students self-censor and that 64% of Princeton undergraduates feel uncomfortable disagreeing with professors on political topics. Only 42% of Princeton students believe the administration protects free speech, below the national average of 36%. Maranto criticizes Eisgruber for prioritizing institutional stability and alumni loyalty over intellectual truth and open debate, noting that the university\u2019s anonymous bias reporting system resembles East Germany\u2019s surveillance. He cites the re-investigation of Classics Professor Joshua Katz\u2019s past misconduct as evidence of bureaucratic overreach, calling Eisgruber\u2019s expressed sadness at Katz\u2019s firing disingenuous given Princeton\u2019s prior portrayal of Katz as racist. Despite these flaws, Maranto argues that Eisgruber\u2019s willingness to engage on free speech issues creates an opportunity for dialogue, urging free speech advocates to make concrete demands rather than confrontational rhetoric, echoing President Obama\u2019s call to engage with those open to negotiation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 10:12 PM\nSource:[WND](https://www.wnd.com/2025/11/princeton-president-sort-supports-free-speech/)\n\n**Kenyon: Dartmouth still has work to do to build public trust - Valley News**\nDartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock publicly rejected the Trump administration's 'Compact for Excellence in Higher Education' in a letter, declining to sign the agreement that required universities to accept that 'academic freedom is not absolute' in exchange for preferential federal funding. Dartmouth was among the last of nine elite institutions to make this decision, joining schools like Brown, MIT, Penn, and the University of Virginia in refusing the compact. The Valley News article praises Beilock's decision as a defense of academic freedom, citing support from Dartmouth professor Peter Golder, who called the move a reaffirmation of core institutional values. However, the article criticizes Beilock\u2019s leadership for lacking public trust, citing her administration\u2019s heavy-handed response to student protests\u2014particularly the May 1, 2024, incident when police in riot gear arrested 89 people, including history professor Annelise Orleck, who was not protesting but checking on students. Orleck and other faculty accuse Beilock of staging faculty meetings, limiting open dialogue, and using condescending rhetoric, such as her claim that Dartmouth teaches 'students how to think, not what to think.' Student activist Roan Wade, suspended for organizing a sit-in and previously arrested for civil disobedience over Dartmouth\u2019s war-related investments, reports a 'chilling effect' on campus activism, especially among international students fearing visa repercussions. The article further criticizes Beilock for appointing Matt Raymer, a known supporter of Trump\u2019s effort to end birthright citizenship, to oversee the Office of Visa and Immigration Services, raising concerns about anti-immigrant bias. The author argues that Beilock must take concrete steps to rebuild trust, including supporting free speech, ending punitive disciplinary actions, and removing Raymer from his sensitive role.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 02:07 PM\nSource:[Valley News](https://vnews.com/2025/10/25/dartmouth-president-beilock-trump-compact/)\n\n**Texas State University upholds firing of Professor Tom Alter for political speech**\nTexas State University has fired tenured historian Professor Thomas Alter on October 13, 2025, citing political speech as grounds for 'serious professional or personal misconduct' under Texas State University System Rules and Regulations, Chapter V, paragraph 4.53. The dismissal followed Alter\u2019s remarks at the September 7, 2025 Revolutionary Socialism Conference, where he advocated for socialism, criticized the U.S. government as 'the most bloodthirsty, profit-driven, mad organization in the history of the world,' and discussed building a revolutionary socialist party to overthrow the U.S. government. The university\u2019s letter stated that Alter\u2019s speech 'implicated Texas State, its students and employees, and safety on campus,' despite no evidence of disruption, violence, or harm. Alter was terminated without prior warning, a hearing, or opportunity to respond, and was immediately locked out of university systems, cut off from his salary and health insurance. After filing a lawsuit and obtaining a temporary restraining order from a Hays County judge, Alter was briefly reinstated\u2014though barred from teaching\u2014pending a hearing. A subsequent summary decision, orchestrated by university president Kelly Damphousse and provost, upheld the firing. The process was criticized as predetermined, lacking transparency and due process. The firing was influenced by Karlyn Borysenko, a Fox News commentator with openly fascist views, who secretly recorded Alter\u2019s speech under false pretenses. The International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) and numerous academic organizations\u2014including the Organization of American Historians, the American Historical Association, and the Labor and Working Class History Association\u2014condemned the firing as a violation of academic freedom, due process, and tenure protections. Students, faculty, and historians have rallied in support, raising over $47,000 via GoFundMe and signing petitions demanding Alter\u2019s reinstatement. The case has been framed as a pivotal test for academic freedom, with critics highlighting the hypocrisy in the university\u2019s treatment of political speech: while it condemned Alter\u2019s socialist advocacy, it has not acted against Republican-led efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the January 6 Capitol riot and the 147 Republican lawmakers who objected to the electoral count.

FAU President Adam Hasner publicly announced on September 13, via social media, that a tenured professor was placed on administrative leave and under investigation, without naming the individual. This move prompted a joint resolution from the FAU Faculty Senate and the United Faculty of Florida, passed unanimously, which condemns the public disclosure of personnel actions tied to protected speech, stating it creates a 'chilling effect' on academic freedom. The resolution affirms the defense of free expression and civil discourse, urging administrators to uphold existing policies that protect legally protected speech, even when controversial. The first identified faculty member, Karen Leader, an associate professor of art and faculty associate in the Center for Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies, shared and commented on others' posts criticizing Kirk on race, gender, guns, and LGBTQ issues. After conservative activists amplified her posts, Hasner\u2019s announcement led to widespread attention and public speculation, though Leader clarified she was not formally disciplined. Two additional faculty members\u2014English Professor Kate Polak and College of Business eminent scholar Rebel Cole\u2014were also placed under investigation, though their names were not publicly disclosed until they came forward. FAU spokesman Joshua Glanzer stated the university is following collective bargaining agreements during the ongoing investigation. Faculty members, including math professor Fred Hoffman, warned that reviewing social media communications is highly unusual and concerning. A second resolution, passed jointly with faculty unions across Florida\u2019s State University System, unequivocally condemns Kirk\u2019s murder as an attack on free expression and calls on Florida leaders to protect higher education as a space for open discourse. The university maintains that investigations are ongoing and that due process is being followed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 11:12 AM\nSource:[SunSentinel](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/10/06/fau-faculty-voice-concern-about-investigations-into-educators-charlie-kirk-comments/)\n\n**University Employee Fired After Criticizing Charlie Kirk Sparks National Debate on Free Speech**\nSuzan Sowers, a university employee at Purdue University in Indiana, was fired five days after posting a Facebook comment criticizing Charlie Kirk, a right-wing influencer, stating, 'If you think Charlie Kirk is a great person, we can't be friends.' The post, which was shared without her knowledge by followers, quickly went viral, leading to a wave of threats, hate messages, and doxxing, including the publication of her home address and voice messages threatening her life. Within 19 minutes of posting, she received threatening calls and messages, including from prominent figures such as Elon Musk, Rudy Giuliani, and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who labeled her comments 'evil' and questioned her fitness for leadership. The university cited the need to combat hate speech and political incitement, aligning with a broader state trend of enforcing 'ethical conduct' through anonymous reporting portals like 'Ethics Point' and government-backed 'Eyes on Education' initiatives. Sowers, who experienced severe psychological distress and described the incident as one of the worst days of her life, became the first employee targeted under this framework, followed by the dismissal of 32 others. The decision sparked national debate over academic freedom and free speech in the U.S., with faculty members expressing fear and self-censorship, while university leadership, including President Charlie Mandziara, defended the firings as necessary to counter political violence. The controversy intensified after President Donald Trump blamed 'radical left' rhetoric for Kirk\u2019s assassination, calling him a 'martyr of truth and freedom,' and urging prosecution of those inciting violence. A campus protest was held, with 100 students and faculty members, including Republican and Democratic student groups, uniting in a joint statement condemning political violence while affirming free expression. However, the university\u2019s actions drew criticism from academics like Professor Michael Hicks, who argued that the response undermined First Amendment values and that the university failed to uphold free speech even for those with whom they disagree. The incident highlights a growing tension between free expression and institutional responses to political polarization in American higher education.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 12:05 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645](https://www.emaratalyoum.com/politics/weekly-supplements/beyond-politics/2025-10-02-1.1976771)\n\n**SC lawmaker wants to defund major college over Charlie Kirk posts by faculty**\nA Republican state House member, Jordan Pace, demanded that South Carolina\u2019s legislature call a special session to punish Clemson University if it does not immediately terminate faculty who allegedly celebrated the assassination of former U.S. Representative Charlie\u202fKirk. In a letter posted on Facebook, Pace wrote, 'Such behavior is intolerable at any public institution funded by South Carolina taxpayers,' and called for Clemson to be defunded, for academic tenure to be ended at all state universities, and for state funding of DEI to be cut. Clemson\u2019s own statement said it had fired one employee and suspended two faculty members pending a review of their social\u2011media posts, noting that 'A full review is underway of the employee social media activity that has been brought to our attention in relation to the recent incident.' The letter also prompted comments from the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, Pamela\u202fEvette; attorney general Alan\u202fWilson, who assured Clemson that it could lawfully terminate the professors; and U.S. House member Nancy\u202fMace, who urged her followers to report any posts praising Kirk\u2019s death. The ACLU of South Carolina issued a statement condemning the political targeting of teachers and defending First Amendment rights, saying the state should not respond to violence by infringing on free speech. The article reports these developments factually without editorializing, presenting the positions of the involved parties and the university\u2019s response.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 11:49 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-praise-clemson-university-b2827164.html)\n\n**Amy Wax's Case Against Penn Dismissed**\nA Pennsylvania district judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Amy Wax, a tenured law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, on Thursday. Wax had been suspended for the 2025\u201126 academic year and placed on half pay after a series of racially, sexist, xenophobic and homophobic remarks. In the January suit, Wax alleged the university discriminated against her because she is a white Jewish woman, claiming she was punished for remarks about Black students while pro\u2011Palestinian faculty were not penalized for speech that allegedly endorsed violence against Jews. Judge Timothy Savage, writing in a 16\u2011page opinion, said the case is not a First Amendment matter but a discrimination case under federal antidiscrimination laws, and concluded Wax failed to allege facts showing her race was a factor in the disciplinary process. He also rejected Wax\u2019s argument that her comments were a statement on behalf of a protected class, noting that \u2018her comments were negative and directed at protected classes\u2019 and that \u2018criticizing minorities does not equate to advocacy for them or for white people.\u2019 Wax was sanctioned in September 2024 after a years\u2011long disciplinary battle over statements such as \u2018gay couples are not fit to raise children,\u2019 \u2018Mexican men are more likely to assault women,\u2019 and \u2018it is rational to be afraid of Black men in elevators.\u2019 The university imposed a one\u2011year suspension on half pay, eliminated her summer pay in perpetuity, publicly reprimanded her, and removed her named chair. In 2018 she was also removed from teaching required courses after commenting on the academic performance of Black students in her first\u2011year classes. The judge\u2019s opinion dismissed the lawsuit, finding no cause of action under federal anti\u2011discrimination statutes based on the content of Wax\u2019s speech.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/29/amy-waxs-case-against-penn-dismissed)\n\n**Judge tosses law professor Amy Wax's bias lawsuit over UPenn sanctions**\nA judge in Philadelphia dismissed University of Pennsylvania law professor Amy Wax\u2019s lawsuit, calling her racial\u2011bias claims \"implausible.\"  Senior U.S. District Judge Timothy Savage said the complaint contained no factual allegations that Wax\u2019s race was part of her disciplinary hearing or appeal, or that it influenced the charges against her.  Wax, who is white, had sued the university in January 2025, alleging that UPenn violated her tenure rights when it suspended her from teaching for one year with half pay in October 2024 after an investigation into statements she made about minority groups that many deemed racist.  She claimed the university disciplined white people more quickly under its free\u2011speech policy while overlooking similar conduct by racial minorities.  Savage noted that the comparison failed because the other speakers named in her suit had not made a pattern of denigrating or derogatory statements about minorities.  In June the judge denied Wax\u2019s bid for a preliminary injunction, finding she had not shown that she would suffer irreparable harm, a damaged reputation, or a negative impact on her speaking opportunities.  Wax has clashed with UPenn administrators for years: students and faculty called for her firing in 2017 after she co\u2011authored a piece praising Anglo\u2011Protestant cultural norms; in 2018 the law school banned her from teaching required first\u2011year courses after she said on a podcast that she had never seen a Black law student graduate in the top quarter of his or her class; and in 2022 she wrote a blog post stating the United States is \"better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration\" as long as most Asians vote for Democrats, prompting the former dean to call for a major sanction.  \"There are no factual allegations in her complaint showing that her race was part of her disciplinary hearing or appeal,\" Savage wrote, underscoring the judge\u2019s view that Wax\u2019s claims lack substantiation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource:[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-tosses-law-professor-amy-waxs-bias-lawsuit-over-upenn-sanctions-2025-08-28/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts across legal, academic administration, higher education policy, and organizational behavior domains agree that it is highly unlikely Amy Wax will no longer have tenure at a top-24 US university before January 1, 2026. The consensus is built on several key recurring themes: (1) Tenure revocation at elite universities is extraordinarily rare and procedurally complex, typically requiring a multi-stage process that can take months or years and must accommodate multiple layers of due process and opportunities for appeal. (2) As of late November 2025, Wax remains a tenured professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, though she is suspended, has suffered salary reduction, lost her named chair, and is barred from teaching\u2014a pattern of severe, but non-terminal, disciplinary action. (3) Ongoing and recently intensified litigation by Wax, both in federal and state courts, further delays any possibility of tenure removal, since institutions are highly risk-averse when legal actions are unfolding. (4) No public reporting or official action indicates that Penn is currently moving to revoke Wax\u2019s tenure or that she is planning to resign or accept a settlement that would qualify as loss of tenure. (5) Even with national trends toward harsher faculty discipline, prominent precedents such as the Joshua Katz case at Princeton typically involved factors beyond protected speech and still required lengthy, highly visible proceedings. (6) The short time remaining\u2014barely over a month\u2014before the resolution date means there is insufficient time for UPenn to complete all institutional, legal, and governance hurdles for tenure revocation and for all appeals or court challenges to be exhausted. The most probable scenario is that Wax remains in a suspended, marginalized, but technically tenured position as of the deadline, with unresolved litigation and no new significant infractions pushing the university to expedite revocation. Final assigned probabilities from the panel are tightly clustered between 2% and 7%, all reflecting a strong 'No' forecast barring an extremely fast-developing, highly unforeseen change, such as a surprise voluntary resignation, a settlement, or new misconduct. In summary: It is extremely improbable Amy Wax will lose her tenure at a top-24 US university before January 2026.",
