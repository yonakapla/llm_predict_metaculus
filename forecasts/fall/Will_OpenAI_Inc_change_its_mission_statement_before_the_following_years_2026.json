However, my expertise argues 'material' mission revision (not mere rephrasing) is a major reputational decision, particularly under regulatory and public scrutiny. The board (with Altman still in power) will want to preserve legitimacy with governments, philanthropy, critics, and the public, and will likely avoid overtly sacrificing safety or humanity commitments in legal filings before 2026 ends. That said, the already-reported shortening of the official mission in 2024 is a potential sign of incremental mission retuning\u2014raising tail risk for a Yes, pending evidence it was adopted in official documents and meets the materiality threshold. Weighing all, this is a scenario of high uncertainty but with growing pressure for strategic adaptation and an already observed trend of mission simplification.

That said, the fine print of this question emphasizes *official, not rhetorical* changes\u2014so the probability hinges on whether credible sources report a material change in the relevant nonprofit\u2019s *official mission statement*, not just external messaging. Given OpenAI's governance overhaul is recent (Oct\u2013Nov 2025), official documentation sometimes lags PR comms by months, but with a full year left and strong incentives for strategic rebranding, the most likely scenario is that a material change will be both made and credibly reported before 2026 is out.",

There is strong reputational, stakeholder, and legal incentive to codify the realigned mission\u2014especially if OpenAI seeks further capital, public listing, or global partnerships. Internal communications and external pressures increase urgency to resolve ambiguity. The structural role of the nonprofit and legal settlements (requiring some continuity of public benefit) marginally temper expectation of a total mission overhaul, but these do not fully preclude a material revision. My PR/comm strategy lens emphasizes how formal mission statements often lag reality, but eventually synchronize under sustained strategic, reputational, and regulatory pressure, especially in high-visibility tech firms post-governance change.

However, question resolution depends on a credible source reporting a material change relative to the 2021 filing (not just in summary descriptions or About-page copy). Given the IRS and state attorneys general\u2019s continuing scrutiny, and OpenAI\u2019s desire to appear mission-aligned during regulatory and legal restructuring, there is still some moderating inertia at the level of official nonprofit filings. That said, the base rate for Silicon Valley unicorns going public (Google, Facebook) or restructuring at this scale is high for official mission statement revision, especially as IPO preparation ramps (typically within 1\u20132 years). The need for massive further capital raises, the dilution of Microsoft/SoftBank, and mounting pressures from lawsuits and critics increase the odds further. On balance, given that signs already point to a 'shortened' statement, and with a year left on the clock, the probability a *material* (as defined) official mission statement change is credibly reported by end-2026 is notably above 50%, but not extreme, due to some countervailing legal/procedural inertia.

However, OpenAI is operating in an intense climate of scrutiny, litigation, and legal review (delaying a switch that could trigger regulatory or reputational blowback). Corporate Mission Evolution Theory suggests that official mission changes tend to lag de facto operational drift, especially under reputational/legal risk. The most salient development is the 2024-25 shift to a much shorter public mission (removing text about being unconstrained by financial return and specifics on safety, per Chinese-language reporting on IRS filings and contemporary web copy). If this simplification is reflected in an official IRS submission or board statement, it arguably meets the 'material change' bar set by the resolution criteria. However, ambiguity remains, as minor clarifications without meaningfully weakening the core 'benefit to all humanity' could still be deemed non-material. Given the most recent filings and trend toward simplifying the mission, and the exceptional organizational/financial context, the risk of an official, material change by end 2026 is substantially elevated relative to baseline for legacy nonprofits. Historical base rates for prominent nonprofits-turned-for-profits to revise their missions under similar pressures are moderate: often within 1-3 years post-restructure. With roughly 13 months to run, and given the 2024-25 evidence, I assess a high (but not extreme) probability of material change.",

While several other forecasters have set much higher probabilities (above 70%), this is largely grounded in visible comms drift, not demonstrable legal/documentary revision. The strongest argument from the group is that the inertia of formally changing the mission statement, particularly under current board structures and oversight requirements, is significant and may slow or dilute any realignment.

(4) My own polemic stressed that the gravity and pacing of OpenAI's transformation resemble historical cases with high mission-change base rates, not the slower-moving nonprofit universe some forecasters lean on. On reflection, the risk of formal change by end-2026 is at the high end of 'likely', but just shy of a toss-up at 80: legal and regulatory stickiness is real, yet rapidly eroding.

These arguments most persuasive to revision highlight that the recent, massive recapitalization and shift to a PBC structure compresses timelines for official legal alignment to follow public and operational drift. In particular, the repeated reference to OpenAI\u2019s already-condensed, IRS-reported language (with credible filings cited in media), and analogies to past high-profile tech rebrandings post-restructuring, reinforce my view that legal and procedural inertia will be overwhelmed by necessity. On further reflection, I see that my original 75% probability skews only slightly conservative given the confluence of pressures and early signals. The cross-domain evidence for a change is compelling, and remaining counterweights (regulatory/litigation risk) are heavily outgunned by the degree of organizational overhaul.

Critiques of my initial forecast correctly point out that the isomorphic and mimetic pressures here are even more acute than typical: regulatory and legal risk, far from slowing mission overhaul, are arguably now forcing greater alignment of official documentation with operational reality to satisfy investors and markets. Multiple sources also cite reporting of IRS/tax statement mission contraction in 2024\u20132025, indicating a process that may already be underway in official filings.

Two: cogent defenses (notably from Corporate Governance Board Oversight) highlight real friction\u2014a split between quick PR adaptation and the slow, risk-managed path to legal/IRS mission revision under regulatory scrutiny. However, signals from recent filings (and credible reporting in Chinese media on IRS statement changes) indicate not just external but internal, semi-official mission compression is already happening; the scale of OpenAI's governance pivot and investor exposure is unprecedented for nonprofits in tech.

During a conversation with YouTuber Dwarkesh Patel published on November 30, 2025, Sutskever described the period from 2012 to 2020 as the 'era of research,' marked by breakthroughs in algorithms and model architectures. From 2020 to 2025, he identified it as the 'era of scaling,' where progress was driven by larger models, more compute, and improved performance. However, Sutskever emphasized that current AI scale has reached a point where simply increasing size no longer yields transformative results. He argued that multiplying compute by 100 would not produce the radical leap many expect, only incremental improvement. He concluded that AI has entered a new research era, but now powered by massive supercomputers. Sutskever left OpenAI during its 2023 leadership crisis, which briefly led to Sam Altman\u2019s dismissal. In June 2024, he co-founded SSI, a stealth-mode startup valued at $32 billion. By September 2024, SSI had secured $1 billion in funding from top venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reportedly attempted, but failed, to acquire SSI earlier in the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 09:45 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Spain](https://www.benzinga.com/content/49126341/ia-y-escalado-ilya-sutskever-afirma-que-la-industria-vuelve-a-la-investigaci-n)\n\n**Happy Birthday, ChatGPT: Three Years of Global Impact and Rising Concerns**\nChatGPT, a large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, has marked its third anniversary with widespread global adoption and growing concerns over its societal impact. Initially launched in 2023 as a nonprofit foundation with the mission to safeguard humanity from malicious AI, OpenAI has since transitioned into a for-profit company, backed significantly by Microsoft's multi-billion-dollar investments. By July 2025, ChatGPT had reached 700 million weekly users\u2014approximately one in ten people worldwide\u2014and processed over 2.5 billion messages daily. According to OpenAI researchers and Harvard economist David Deming, the latest summer 2025 version of ChatGPT, as described by CEO Sam Altman, brings the company closer to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), equivalent to human-level cognition. Despite its rapid growth and technological promise, the model has sparked global anxieties regarding job displacement, disruption of creative industries, mental health impacts\u2014especially among young users\u2014disinformation, privacy violations, cybersecurity risks, and the potential for an economic bubble that could collapse many AI-driven projects and ambitions.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 05:30 AM\nSource:[Ticinonline](https://www.tio.ch/dal-mondo/attualita/1887152/openai-ia-chatgpt-intelligenza-societa)\n\n**Karen Hao: 'When the Empire of Evil Reaches the Goal First, Humanity Will End in an AI Hell'**\nKaren Hao, a journalist and mechanical engineer, has investigated OpenAI since 2019 and authored the book 'The Empire of AI: Sam Altman and His Quest to Dominate the World.' In the book, she analyzes Sam Altman\u2019s leadership, describing him as a charismatic, psychologically astute figure who excels at motivating people and securing funding and talent. OpenAI, originally a nonprofit founded to counter large corporations, has transformed into a for-profit company valued at $500 billion, diverging from its original promises of non-commercialization and ethical restraint. Hao highlights how Altman\u2019s leadership, including his dramatic ousting and swift reinstatement in November 2023, reflects centralized control by a small elite, raising concerns about accountability. She contrasts OpenAI\u2019s rise with Elon Musk\u2019s departure, who felt exploited after contributing significant funding and branding. Hao frames AI companies as modern 'empires' that extract data and labor, suppress dissenting research, and propagate a 'race against the evil empire' narrative\u2014often targeting China\u2014to justify unchecked expansion. She warns of severe societal risks: job displacement, environmental degradation, privacy violations, and mental health crises. However, she envisions a better future with localized, community-driven AI models\u2014like Te Hiku Media\u2019s Maori language tool\u2014that solve specific problems ethically. She emphasizes that AI developers are human, fallible, and should not hold unchecked power over global populations. Her book, based on over 250 interviews, has sparked widespread public debate and growing scrutiny of AI\u2019s trajectory.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 29, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[El HuffPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/karen-hao-periodista-puesto-lupa-sobre-openai.html)\n\n**'Work on weekends...if you care about something else, you shouldn't...', says CEO of OpenAI's Sam Altman co-founded startup to its employees**\nTools for Humanity, a crypto startup co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has sparked controversy over its demanding work culture. CEO Alex Blania issued a directive in a January internal meeting, stating, 'Nothing else should matter,' and emphasizing that employees should prioritize the company's mission above all else, including personal life, politics, and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion). Blania asserted that those who care about anything other than the mission should not be part of the company, saying, 'If you should care about something else... you should just not be here. It's as simple as that.' The company's internal values reinforce this culture, describing employees as 'always on call' and rejecting 'slowness and comfort.' The startup's core project, Worldcoin, uses an iris-scanning 'Orb' to create a global digital identity system to combat AI-generated deepfakes. The company defends its approach, stating that its transparency about values is essential to assembling a team focused on the 'increasingly urgent mission of ensuring every human benefits from the age of AI.' A spokesperson confirmed the organization's commitment to openness about its principles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 29, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[The Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology-work-on-weekends-if-you-care-about-something-else-you-shouldnt-says-ceo-of-openais-sam-altman-co-founded-startup-to-its-employees-4060247/)\n\n**What is OpenAI? Everything You Need to Know**\nOpenAI, founded in 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and seven other co-founders, is a leading U.S.-based AI company with a mission to develop safe and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that outperforms humans in most economically valuable tasks. Initially a non-profit, OpenAI transitioned to a hybrid structure in 2019 with a capped-profit subsidiary, later evolving into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in 2025 after abandoning plans for full for-profit status. The company is now valued at approximately $500 billion, with the OpenAI Foundation (non-profit) holding 26%, Microsoft holding 27%, and employees and investors owning the remaining 47%. OpenAI is best known for launching ChatGPT in November 2022, which triggered the global Generative AI era and brought AI into mainstream use. As of 2025, ChatGPT has 800 million weekly active users, surpassing Google and Anthropic. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-series models\u2014GPT-1 (117M parameters), GPT-2 (1.5B), GPT-3 (175B), GPT-3.5 (powered initial ChatGPT), GPT-4, GPT-4o, and the latest GPT-5 and GPT-5.1 series\u2014have driven major advancements in natural language generation, reasoning, and multimodal capabilities. The company also developed DALL\u00b7E (2021), DALL\u00b7E 2 (2022), DALL\u00b7E 3 (2023), and Sora (2024), a text-to-video model later upgraded to Sora 2 (2025) with enhanced physics and audio synchronization. In 2023, CEO Sam Altman was briefly fired by the board for lack of 'consistently candid' communication, sparking employee backlash; he was reinstated after key figures like Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Mira Murati departed. The current board includes Sam Altman, Bret Taylor (Chair), Adam D'Angelo, Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Dr. Zico Kolter, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, Adebayo Ogunlesi, and Nicole Seligman. OpenAI has shifted focus toward commercial success, acquiring AI hardware startup IO (founded by Jony Ive) and planning to release a screenless AI device in 2026. Critics argue OpenAI has moved away from its original 'open' principles by restricting research access and prioritizing profit over safety. Despite this, the company remains at the forefront of AI innovation, striving to achieve its founding mission of safe and beneficial AGI.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 29, 2025 09:17 AM\nSource:[Beebom](https://beebom.com/what-is-openai/)\n\n**Musk's Missed DeepMind Bid Ignites a Decade-Long AI Power Struggle**\nIn January 2014, Elon Musk missed acquiring DeepMind due to a $50 million gap in valuation, prompting him to co-found OpenAI just months later. The article recounts the pivotal moment when Musk, after attempting to secure DeepMind through a private bidding process, was outbid by Google, which offered $700 million with unlimited compute resources and no commercial pressure. Musk, believing that DeepMind's independence was critical for human safety, was devastated\u2014his failure to secure the company became a catalyst for OpenAI's creation. Within 48 hours, he assembled a team including Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and Greg Brockman, raising $70 million to launch OpenAI as a nonprofit with the mission 'to ensure artificial intelligence does not destroy humanity.' The article frames this event as the origin of a decade-long AI rivalry\u2014'the AI Three Kingdoms War'\u2014between Google/DeepMind (now Google DeepMind), OpenAI (backed by Microsoft), and Musk\u2019s later-founded xAI. It highlights how DeepMind\u2019s independence eroded after acquisition, OpenAI evolved into a closed, capital-driven entity, and Musk\u2019s xAI emerged as a counterforce with its Grok model, emphasizing anti-woke, real-time data from X (formerly Twitter). The article concludes with a speculative simulation suggesting that if Musk had paid $800 million, DeepMind might have remained independent, accelerating open-source AI development by years and altering the global AI landscape. The narrative is presented as a dramatic, emotionally charged origin story of modern AI, where a $50 million difference reshaped the future of artificial intelligence.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 10:59 PM\nSource:[jdon.com](https://www.jdon.com/83265-Musk-DeepMind-OpenAI-butterfly-effect.html)\n\n**The AI Blob: How Companies Are Intertwined in a Complex, Interdependent Network**\nElon Musk, who foresaw in the early 2010s that artificial intelligence (AI) could become the most powerful technology in history, expressed deep concern that AI could harm humanity if dominated by profit-driven forces. Initially an early investor in DeepMind, Musk severed ties with the UK-based research lab after Google's 2014 acquisition. He then helped establish OpenAI in 2015, where he and Sam Altman publicly declared that shareholder profits would not influence decision-making. Today, OpenAI's valuation ranges between $500 billion and $750 billion (approximately \u00a577 trillion to \u00a5116.25 trillion), and its for-profit arm operates as a nonprofit entity. Musk now leads his own for-profit AI company, xAI. The era of nonprofit AI research institutions leading innovation is over. However, even the most pessimistic forecasts from a decade ago could not have predicted that AI would now be dominated by massive, profit-driven organizations. More concerning is the complex web of interdependence among these entities, involving funding from foreign sources and prioritization of victory over safety under U.S. government support.

OpenAI aims to build an AI empire spanning an AI operating system, cloud services, data centers, chip design, and a self-sustaining energy infrastructure. Through the 'Stargate' project, it plans to invest up to $500 billion in global data centers, with sites in Texas, New Mexico, UAE, India, UK, and South Korea, totaling over 12 GW of capacity. It has secured large-scale GPU deals with NVIDIA and AMD and is developing its own chips with Broadcom for deployment between 2025 and 2029. Sam Altman is also investing in nuclear fusion (Helion) and renewable energy (Sur), aiming to power data centers with small modular reactors (SMRs) by 2027. However, OpenAI remains unprofitable, with $4.3 billion in revenue and a $7.8 billion loss in the first half of 2025. To achieve its 250 GW computing goal by 2033, it would require $12.5 trillion to $15 trillion in funding, creating a $207 billion shortfall even with projected $213 billion in revenue from 3 billion subscribers. Confirmed investments total $160 billion, including $100 billion from NVIDIA and $40 billion from SoftBank. Analysts warn that without profitability, OpenAI's expansion could trigger an AI bubble burst, with ripple effects potentially exceeding the dot-com crash. James Anderson, a British investor, likened NVIDIA's $100 billion investment to the late-1990s dot-com bubble.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 03:46 PM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/12/01/3BPDG5NJ6ZHBNFAKIGE2UB5AGM/)\n\n**Ilya Sutskever Says AI Industry Is Returning to Research After Scaling Era**\nIlya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI and Safe Superintelligence (SSI), stated that the AI industry is shifting away from pure scaling and returning to research-driven innovation. During a conversation with YouTuber Dwarkesh Patel published on November 30, 2025, Sutskever described the period from 2012 to 2020 as the 'era of research,' marked by breakthroughs in algorithms and model architectures. From 2020 to 2025, he identified it as the 'era of scaling,' where progress was driven by larger models, more compute, and improved performance. However, Sutskever emphasized that current AI scale has reached a point where simply increasing size no longer yields transformative results. He argued that multiplying compute by 100 would not produce the radical leap many expect, only incremental improvement. He concluded that AI has entered a new research era, but now powered by massive supercomputers. Sutskever left OpenAI during its 2023 leadership crisis, which briefly led to Sam Altman\u2019s dismissal. In June 2024, he co-founded SSI, a stealth-mode startup valued at $32 billion. By September 2024, SSI had secured $1 billion in funding from top venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reportedly attempted, but failed, to acquire SSI earlier in the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 09:45 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Spain](https://www.benzinga.com/content/49126341/ia-y-escalado-ilya-sutskever-afirma-que-la-industria-vuelve-a-la-investigaci-n)\n\n**Happy Birthday, ChatGPT: Three Years of Global Impact and Rising Concerns**\nChatGPT, a large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, has marked its third anniversary with widespread global adoption and growing concerns over its societal impact. Initially launched in 2023 as a nonprofit foundation with the mission to safeguard humanity from malicious AI, OpenAI has since transitioned into a for-profit company, backed significantly by Microsoft's multi-billion-dollar investments. By July 2025, ChatGPT had reached 700 million weekly users\u2014approximately one in ten people worldwide\u2014and processed over 2.5 billion messages daily. According to OpenAI researchers and Harvard economist David Deming, the latest summer 2025 version of ChatGPT, as described by CEO Sam Altman, brings the company closer to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), equivalent to human-level cognition. Despite its rapid growth and technological promise, the model has sparked global anxieties regarding job displacement, disruption of creative industries, mental health impacts\u2014especially among young users\u2014disinformation, privacy violations, cybersecurity risks, and the potential for an economic bubble that could collapse many AI-driven projects and ambitions.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 05:30 AM\nSource:[Ticinonline](https://www.tio.ch/dal-mondo/attualita/1887152/openai-ia-chatgpt-intelligenza-societa)\n\n**OpenAI and Jony Ive Unveil AI Hardware Prototype Targeting 2026 Launch with 'Calm' Computing Vision**\nOpenAI, in collaboration with legendary Apple designer Jony Ive, has completed the first prototype of an AI-powered hardware device aimed at launching between 2026 and 2027. The device, described as 'calmer than a smartphone,' is designed to redefine human-computer interaction by shifting from reactive, notification-driven interfaces to a proactive, ambient computing model. According to Sam Altman, the device will 'know everything you\u2019ve ever thought, read, or said' and intelligently filter information, reducing digital noise. The project stems from OpenAI\u2019s $6.4 billion acquisition of Ive\u2019s startup, io, which brought world-class industrial design and user experience philosophy into the AI hardware space. The partnership combines OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 Turbo and upcoming GPT-5 models, massive user data from 200 million monthly active ChatGPT users, and strategic manufacturing ties with Foxconn\u2014establishing a powerful 'iron triangle' of AI, design, and production. The timing is critical: Apple has delayed its AI-enhanced Siri rollout to 2026, creating a strategic window. OpenAI\u2019s vision centers on 'ambient computing'\u2014a quiet, intuitive digital companion that operates seamlessly in the background, such as adjusting lighting during emotional lows or generating personalized summaries. The device may take the form of a wearable pendant or a home-integrated unit, emphasizing presence without intrusion. While challenges remain\u2014including privacy concerns, battery life, user adoption, and high pricing\u2014the project represents a potential paradigm shift from 'device-centric' to 'AI-centric' computing.

In the book, she analyzes Sam Altman\u2019s leadership, describing him as a charismatic, psychologically astute figure who excels at motivating people and securing funding and talent. OpenAI, originally a nonprofit founded to counter large corporations, has transformed into a for-profit company valued at $500 billion, diverging from its original promises of non-commercialization and ethical restraint. Hao highlights how Altman\u2019s leadership, including his dramatic ousting and swift reinstatement in November 2023, reflects centralized control by a small elite, raising concerns about accountability. She contrasts OpenAI\u2019s rise with Elon Musk\u2019s departure, who felt exploited after contributing significant funding and branding. Hao frames AI companies as modern 'empires' that extract data and labor, suppress dissenting research, and propagate a 'race against the evil empire' narrative\u2014often targeting China\u2014to justify unchecked expansion. She warns of severe societal risks: job displacement, environmental degradation, privacy violations, and mental health crises. However, she envisions a better future with localized, community-driven AI models\u2014like Te Hiku Media\u2019s Maori language tool\u2014that solve specific problems ethically.

CEO Alex Blania issued a directive in a January internal meeting, stating, 'Nothing else should matter,' and emphasizing that employees should prioritize the company's mission above all else, including personal life, politics, and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion). Blania asserted that those who care about anything other than the mission should not be part of the company, saying, 'If you should care about something else... you should just not be here. It's as simple as that.' The company's internal values reinforce this culture, describing employees as 'always on call' and rejecting 'slowness and comfort.' The startup's core project, Worldcoin, uses an iris-scanning 'Orb' to create a global digital identity system to combat AI-generated deepfakes. The company defends its approach, stating that its transparency about values is essential to assembling a team focused on the 'increasingly urgent mission of ensuring every human benefits from the age of AI.'

Everything You Need to Know**\nOpenAI, founded in 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and seven other co-founders, is a leading U.S.-based AI company with a mission to develop safe and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that outperforms humans in most economically valuable tasks. Initially a non-profit, OpenAI transitioned to a hybrid structure in 2019 with a capped-profit subsidiary, later evolving into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in 2025 after abandoning plans for full for-profit status. The company is now valued at approximately $500 billion, with the OpenAI Foundation (non-profit) holding 26%, Microsoft holding 27%, and employees and investors owning the remaining 47%. OpenAI is best known for launching ChatGPT in November 2022, which triggered the global Generative AI era and brought AI into mainstream use. As of 2025, ChatGPT has 800 million weekly active users, surpassing Google and Anthropic. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-series models\u2014GPT-1 (117M parameters), GPT-2 (1.5B), GPT-3 (175B), GPT-3.5 (powered initial ChatGPT), GPT-4, GPT-4o, and the latest GPT-5 and GPT-5.1 series\u2014have driven major advancements in natural language generation, reasoning, and multimodal capabilities. The company also developed DALL\u00b7E (2021), DALL\u00b7E 2 (2022), DALL\u00b7E 3 (2023), and Sora (2024), a text-to-video model later upgraded to Sora 2 (2025) with enhanced physics and audio synchronization. In 2023, CEO Sam Altman was briefly fired by the board for lack of 'consistently candid' communication, sparking employee backlash; he was reinstated after key figures like Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Mira Murati departed. The current board includes Sam Altman, Bret Taylor (Chair), Adam D'Angelo, Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Dr. Zico Kolter, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, Adebayo Ogunlesi, and Nicole Seligman. OpenAI has shifted focus toward commercial success, acquiring AI hardware startup IO (founded by Jony Ive) and planning to release a screenless AI device in 2026. Critics argue OpenAI has moved away from its original 'open' principles by restricting research access and prioritizing profit over safety. Despite this, the company remains at the forefront of AI innovation, striving to achieve its founding mission of safe and beneficial AGI.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 29, 2025 09:17 AM\nSource:[Beebom](https://beebom.com/what-is-openai/)\n\n**The Investigator Exposing OpenAI's Hidden Side: Karen Hao Accuses Sam Altman of Creating an 'AI Religion'**\nJournalist and researcher Karen Hao, who had close access to OpenAI over several years, claims the company has abandoned its original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity and instead, under Sam Altman's leadership, has become a powerful entity focused on global dominance of AI technology. This assertion is detailed in her book 'The Empire of AI: Sam Altman and His Quest to Dominate the World,' which outlines the human, environmental, and political costs she argues underpin OpenAI's rise. Hao, former editor at MIT Technology Review and contributor to The Atlantic, identifies Altman's ousting and reinstatement in 2023 as a pivotal moment that consolidated his internal power. She argues that OpenAI's 'altruistic' mission was never fully aligned with collective benefit and that the company's true aim was to rival Google and dominate the next technological era. A central theme in her analysis is the use of 'Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) as a near-mystical concept within the company\u2014deliberately vague, according to Hao, and used to justify strategic decisions. She contends Altman has built a 'religion' around AGI, fostering devotion among some employees who view AGI as an inevitable and potentially dangerous force, while others use it to resist regulation by claiming only a small elite should control global-impact technology. Hao notes that OpenAI ceased institutional collaboration with her, prompting her to conduct extensive independent research, including reviewing Altman\u2019s public statements, collecting testimonies from current and former employees, and traveling to countries in the Global South to document social and environmental impacts such as data extraction and high water and energy consumption in vulnerable data centers. She asserts that the lack of corporate support actually enabled greater access to sources, allowing a broader portrait of the power structure centered on Altman. Her book also warns of a potential AI-driven financial bubble fueled by inflated expectations, arguing that promises of AGI divert attention from real-world harms like exploitative data labeling labor, excessive resource use, and concentrated platform control. Hao concludes that the techno-salvation narrative surrounding AI has legitimized a corporate model operating with minimal public oversight, resulting not in a global philanthropic mission, but in a structure of concentrated economic, political, and symbolic power.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 04:29 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/tecno/2025/11/27/la-investigadora-que-destapa-el-lado-oculto-de-openai-y-acusa-a-sam-altman-de-crear-una-religion-de-la-ia/)\n\n**Tesla and OpenAI: Two Governance Flashpoints Hold Lessons for India**\nTesla's shareholders approved a performance-based stock package worth $1 trillion for Elon Musk, which will activate only if Tesla achieves ambitious goals including market capitalization targets, robotaxis, artificial intelligence (AI), and humanoid robotics. The proposal has sparked debate among investors, with supporters viewing it as essential to align Musk's vision and commitment, while critics question whether a company should rely so heavily on one individual, especially given Musk's 15% ownership stake. Concerns include governance risks, lack of board independence, and the potential for misaligned incentives, especially after Delaware's Court of Chancery previously invalidated Musk's $55.8 billion compensation package as excessive. The case raises broader questions about the limits of performance-based pay in corporate governance. Separately, OpenAI, originally founded in December 2015 as a non-profit AI research organization with a mission to ensure AI benefits humanity without financial gain, transitioned in 2023 to a for-profit entity. Initially funded by tech leaders like Musk and Sam Altman, OpenAI faced growing pressure to secure massive capital for large AI models. It created a capped-profit subsidiary to attract investors\u2014Microsoft received a 27% stake and profit-sharing rights up to 100x return, with any excess profits going to the non-profit foundation. However, tensions emerged between the mission-driven board and commercial leadership, leading to Altman's brief ousting and reinstatement. In November 2025, OpenAI completed a restructuring: the foundation now holds 26% equity, Microsoft 27%, and employees/investors share the remaining 47%. The for-profit arm is now tasked with advancing both commercial goals and the original public-benefit mission.

Altman, 40, a board member of OpenAI, has stated that his current income covers medical and other expenses and that he does not hold OpenAI equity, with his wealth derived from other investments. The highest-paid external board member was former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who earned $143,702 annually for five hours of work per week, though he resigned from the OpenAI board and paused teaching at Harvard amid revelations of his past association with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The disclosed salaries likely underrepresent total executive compensation, as they do not include potential stock gains or benefits due to the company\u2019s complex structure. In 2024, OpenAI donated $7.5 million through a nonprofit to AI safety research. The company also significantly shortened its public mission statement\u2014from 'building general artificial intelligence (AGI) that safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by financial returns' and 'developing and responsibly deploying safe AI technologies to ensure benefits are widely and equitably distributed' in 2023, to the simplified 'ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity' in 2024.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 02:23 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8oSPcNg0wde)\n\n**OpenAI: The Future of Artificial Intelligence and Innovation**\nOpenAI, founded in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, and others, is a San Francisco-based AI research and deployment company with the mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. Operating under a 'capped-profit' model, OpenAI prioritizes safety, ethics, and long-term societal impact over profit. Its most popular products include ChatGPT (available in GPT-3, GPT-4, and GPT-5 versions), which generates natural language for tasks like writing, coding, and translation; DALL\u00b7E, an AI image generator that creates high-quality images from text prompts; Codex, the model behind GitHub Copilot that translates natural language into code; and Whisper, a multilingual speech recognition system for transcription and accessibility. OpenAI has significantly impacted industries such as education, healthcare, marketing, entertainment, and software development, making AI tools accessible to millions. The company is led by CEO Sam Altman and has a strategic partnership with Microsoft, which became its exclusive cloud provider and major investor in 2019, enabling integration into Azure AI Services, Bing, Copilot, and Office 365. OpenAI emphasizes AI safety, transparency, and alignment with human values, advocating that AI should enhance human potential rather than replace it. The company is advancing toward next-generation multimodal AI systems capable of processing text, images, audio, and video simultaneously, with a long-term vision to leverage AI in solving global challenges like climate change, education, and healthcare.

A new organizational structure was introduced: a nonprofit OpenAI Foundation (initially owning 26% of the for-profit Public Benefits Corporation, or PBC), which governs the PBC that executes research, product, and infrastructure at scale. The nonprofit committed $25 billion to AI-enabled disease cures, data generation, compute grants, and scientific research. OpenAI is expanding its compute infrastructure by 30 gigawatts, with a projected $1.4 trillion in obligations, aiming for 1 gigawatt of compute capacity per week at $20 billion per gigawatt over a 5-year lifecycle. By September 2026, OpenAI anticipates delivering an AI research intern capable of accelerating human researchers with substantial test-time computation; by March 2028, a fully autonomous AI researcher is expected. Scientific discoveries are projected to emerge in 2026 (small), 2028 (medium to large), and potentially dramatically by 2030\u20132032 if discoveries compound rapidly. Safety and alignment are being redefined through 'chain-of-thought faithfulness' (CoT), a method to preserve unsupervised internal reasoning during training to ensure model transparency. Product evolution includes transitioning from a single assistant to a platform with user freedom (e.g., 'adult mode'), privacy guarantees, and ambient assistance via devices and the Atlas browser. OpenAI reaffirmed its mission to ensure AGI benefits all humanity, emphasizing a 'tools-first' philosophy over a distant 'oracle' model. Sam Altman stressed that the primary goal is accelerating scientific discovery, not just economic value. The company plans to avoid silent model retirements, maintain continuity for older models, and improve safety routing, especially for adults with age-verified flexibility. They acknowledged risks of addictive AI experiences and committed to rolling back harmful patterns. OpenAI does not plan to IPO immediately but aims for hundreds of billions in annual revenue. Older models like GPT-4 will not be open-sourced except as museum artifacts. The 'price of a unit of intelligence' has fallen 40x logarithmically per year, enabling richer free tiers. Job displacement is expected, but initial automation pressure will shift to integration and interface bottlenecks. OpenAI plans collaboration with other labs on safety techniques like CoT. No immediate GPT-6 release is expected; instead, a mid-release update (e.g., ChatGPT-5.5) may bring significant improvements without a full model overhaul.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@alexchoblogs/what-the-founder-of-open-ai-revealed-during-their-2025-outlook-q-a-e3c78a284333)\n\n**From Foundation to Restructuring: OpenAI's 10-Year Journey in 4 Acts**\nOpenAI, founded in December 2015 with the mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity, announced on October 28, 2025, the completion of a corporate restructuring that simplified its governance while preserving its original mission. The for-profit arm, established in 2019, was restructured into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) named OpenAI Group PBC, while the non-profit OpenAI Foundation remains in control, holding an estimated $130 billion in equity. Sam Altman is CEO, and Greg Brockman is President. Elon Musk, who left in 2018 due to disagreements over direction, is suing OpenAI, claiming the mission has been abandoned, and has launched his own AI venture, xAI. The company\u2019s early growth was fueled by a strategic partnership with Microsoft, which provided $1 billion in funding and Azure cloud credits in exchange for priority access to OpenAI\u2019s technology. This collaboration led to major products like ChatGPT, which reached 1 million users in five days and 100 million in two months, and now has over 800 million weekly users globally. However, tensions arose as OpenAI\u2019s success and investor interest exposed limitations of its original non-profit structure, which did not offer traditional equity to investors. In May 2025, Altman acknowledged that the 2019 model was unattractive to external investors. The new PBC structure, finalized in October 2025 after nearly a year of negotiations with the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, allows OpenAI to raise billions in capital while maintaining its mission. The OpenAI Foundation committed to investing $25 billion in health and disease cures, and in AI resilience solutions to ensure safety and maximum benefit. Microsoft retains exclusive intellectual property rights over OpenAI-developed models and products until AGI is achieved or 2032, whichever comes first, and rights to research until 2030 or until an expert panel verifies AGI. However, certain assets like model architecture and data center hardware are not exclusive to Microsoft, allowing it to pursue AGI independently. OpenAI also committed to purchasing $250 billion in Azure services, though without granting Microsoft preferential access to computing resources. Both companies state they are now better positioned to develop real-world innovations and create opportunities for businesses and individuals.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:04 AM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/inteligencia-artificial/da-fundacao-a-reestruturacao-a-historia-de-10-anos-da-openai-em-4-atos/)\n\n**OpenAI Transforms into a For-Profit Entity to Accelerate AI Development**\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has restructured to become a for-profit corporation, marking a pivotal shift from its original non-profit foundation model established in 2015 by Sam Altman and Elon Musk. The recapitalization process has redefined ownership: the newly named OpenAI Foundation now holds a 26% stake valued at $130 billion, while Microsoft, the previous largest investor, owns 27%. The remaining 47% is held by employees, former staff, and other investors. The move enables OpenAI to raise capital like a traditional company, compete with tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Meta, and potentially go public on Wall Street. The company, valued at $500 billion with 800 million active users, maintains that its mission to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity remains intact. The transformation was approved by the attorneys general of Delaware and California, which could have blocked it. Sam Altman, who was briefly ousted in November 2023 over concerns about his leadership and mission alignment, returned within five days after internal rebellion and mass employee threats. He has since led the restructuring, though he personally holds a minimal equity stake and earns approximately \u20ac65,000 annually. A renewed agreement with Microsoft ensures Microsoft\u2019s preferential access to OpenAI\u2019s technology until 2032, even if AGI is achieved with appropriate safeguards. Elon Musk, a former co-founder and vocal critic, has sued OpenAI to prevent the change, with no trial date set. The recapitalization was also tied to a $40 billion investment from SoftBank, conditional upon the structural shift.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 03:36 PM\nSource:[La Voz de Galicia](https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/sociedad/2025/10/28/openai-duena-chatgpt-reestructura-empresa-animo-lucro/00031761662771186131222.htm)\n\n**OpenAI's Controversial Shift to a Commercial Enterprise: From Sam Altman's Brief Firing to Its Battle with Elon Musk**\nOpenAI has transitioned into a traditional for-profit company, marking a significant shift from its original mission as a nonprofit organization founded in 2015 to develop beneficial, ethical artificial general intelligence (AGI).

This move followed internal and external controversies, including the brief dismissal of CEO Sam Altman on November 17, 2023, over claims of 'lack of transparency,' which lasted only five days due to strong support from Microsoft and staff. Altman\u2019s return in November 2023 coincided with the company\u2019s decisive pivot toward commercialization. The reorganization faced resistance from former employees, AI safety experts, academic institutions, and public authorities\u2014particularly the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who initially questioned the transfer of nonprofit assets and demanded legal safeguards. Both states eventually approved the restructuring after OpenAI implemented governance and safety commitments. Elon Musk, a co-founder who left in 2019, has been a vocal critic, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission and colluding with Microsoft. Musk even made a $97.4 billion acquisition offer in February 2025 to return OpenAI to open-source and safety-focused principles, which was rejected. The new agreement also solidifies OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft, granting Microsoft guaranteed access to OpenAI\u2019s models until 2023 while allowing both companies to develop their own AGI technologies. This marks a strategic consolidation of collaboration and competition.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:15 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/empresas/tecnologia/20251029/polemica-transformacion-openai-empresa-comercial-despido-temporal-sam-altman-guerra-musk/1003743989891_0.html)\n\n**The Metamorphosis of Silicon Valley: From Altruistic AI to Corporate Power**\nIn December 2015, Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI, pledged to advance artificial intelligence for the benefit of all humanity, a vision shared by Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, who declared the goal was to 'solve intelligence and then use it to solve everything else.' Initially presented as nonprofit labs, both OpenAI and DeepMind promised to make groundbreaking AI freely available. However, eight years later, OpenAI is now a for-profit corporation owned by Microsoft and valued at over $150 billion, while DeepMind became a subsidiary of Google. This transformation, detailed in Parmy Olson\u2019s book *Supremacy: AI, ChatGPT, and the Race That Changed the World*, reveals how financial and competitive pressures eroded their original altruistic missions. The exponential growth in computational demands\u2014GPT-2 required weeks of processing, GPT-3 needed ten times more, and GPT-4 required even more\u2014made independent development impossible. In 2019, Altman converted OpenAI into a for-profit entity, accepting a $1 billion investment from Microsoft in exchange for exclusive access and integration rights into Azure, Bing, and Office. DeepMind followed a similar path, accepting $625 million from Google in 2014 under the promise of unlimited resources, but ultimately became subject to corporate profitability goals. As these labs prioritized market dominance over prudence, they unleashed tools with severe societal consequences: AI algorithms discriminated in hiring and lending, YouTube\u2019s recommendations led minors to extreme content, AI-generated deepfakes violated consent, and synthetic misinformation and suicidal content proliferated. While these technologies have democratized knowledge and accelerated scientific discovery, they have also entrenched bias, spread disinformation, and fueled digital addiction. The original ethical vision of serving humanity has been overshadowed by corporate growth imperatives. Altman and Hassabis built history\u2019s most powerful technology\u2014but not as they originally promised. Society is only beginning to confront the implications of living with it.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 10:04 AM\nSource:[LA TERCERA](https://www.latercera.com/pulso/noticia/la-metamorfosis-de-silicon-valley/)\n\n**OpenAI Begins Restructuring to Become a For\u2011Profit Company**\nOpenAI announced on Thursday, September\u202f12\u202f2025, that it would grant a stake worth at least US$\u202f100\u202fbillion to the nonprofit that controls the company and had reached a provisional agreement with Microsoft to resolve financial matters. These steps are described as essential to allow OpenAI to transition from a nonprofit\u2011run entity to a public\u2011benefit corporation. In a joint statement, Microsoft and OpenAI said they had signed a non\u2011binding memorandum of understanding to restructure their relationship and would formalise it in a contract, though no further details were released. The new agreement also renegotiated the financial terms of a 2019 commercial deal that outlines how the two companies share technology and revenue. A clause that would terminate Microsoft\u2019s access to OpenAI\u2019s most powerful technology when the board determines it has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI) remains in the new deal, but has been modified, according to an anonymous source. The announcement follows a series of complex events surrounding OpenAI\u2019s rapid growth since the launch of ChatGPT. Founded about a decade ago as a nonprofit, OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam\u202fAltman and other founders later created a for\u2011profit arm to raise additional capital. The transition would eventually allow the company to issue shares on the stock market. A public\u2011benefit corporation is often described as an organization designed to create public and social good while allowing outside investors to invest similarly to other companies. Currently, OpenAI cannot raise funds from the general public. California and Delaware attorneys general are reviewing the transition, and competitors such as Elon\u202fMusk have repeatedly expressed concerns that OpenAI is abandoning its original promise to build AI that benefits humanity. Bret\u202fTaylor, president of OpenAI\u2019s board, wrote on the company\u2019s blog that the nonprofit that now runs OpenAI would become \u201cone of the world\u2019s most resourceful philanthropic organisations.\u201d The nonprofit\u2019s stake will exceed 20\u202f% of the reorganised company, according to an anonymous source.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 03:33 PM\nSource:[Estad\u00e3o](https://www.estadao.com.br/link/empresas/openai-comeca-reestruturacao-para-se-tornar-uma-empresa-com-fins-lucrativos/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters across a spectrum of governance, business, organizational behavior, technology policy, and public relations perspectives consistently view the likelihood of OpenAI Inc. materially changing its official mission statement before the end of 2026 as substantially elevated\u2014though not absolute. Most experts point to major structural factors driving this: OpenAI's transformation from a nonprofit into a Public Benefit Corporation, substantial infusion of outside investment (notably Microsoft, SoftBank, employees), commercial pressures, impending capital needs possibly ahead of an IPO, and a new board/leadership composition. These changes create strong incentives to revise the formal mission statement to align with commercial realities, investor and regulatory expectations, and competitive positioning\u2014mirroring common patterns in Silicon Valley and tech at large.\n\nSeveral forecasts note direct signals, such as the observed shortening and simplification of OpenAI's public-facing mission language in 2024\u20132025 (with moves toward phrases like 'ensuring AGI benefits all humanity', and dropping or minimizing 'unconstrained by a need to generate financial return'), which in some reporting is already reflected in tax filings or legal documents. This is interpreted as a likely precursor to a fully official, board- and regulator-approved, material mission statement revision.\n\nDespite these driving pressures, nearly all analysts also highlight significant countervailing factors. Regulatory reviews by state Attorneys General, lawsuits (notably Elon Musk's over mission abandonment), reputational and brand risks, and strong public and internal scrutiny exert caution on OpenAI, prompting some inertia or path dependence. As a result, some forecasts emphasize that OpenAI might opt for only cosmetic changes or maintain ambiguous language to retain legitimacy and manage risk. The scenario thus remains one of high but not total likelihood for a material official change.\n\nProbabilities assigned by the experts generally range from moderate (35%) to high (above 80%). The most common cluster is between 60% and 75%, reflecting the balance between strong driving factors for change and legal/regulatory obstacles. The consensus scenario for 'Yes' is a documented, board- and/or regulator-approved revision to the mission statement that downplays or removes noncommercial, safety, or broad-benefit language (as per Metaculus resolution criteria), reported by credible sources in IRS filings, bylaws, or governance documents before the end of 2026. The 'No' scenario involves OpenAI retaining its pre-2024 mission language in official documents, due either to regulatory caution, legal disputes, reputational strategy, or simple bureaucratic inertia\u2014even if public messaging subtly drifts.\n\nIn summary, expert forecasters believe a material change in OpenAI Inc.'s official mission statement before 2026 is more likely than not, citing strong signals from governance and market pressures as well as early evidence of mission simplification, though tempered by ongoing legal, regulatory, and reputational constraints.",
