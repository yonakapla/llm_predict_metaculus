The CMA has both the legal power and clear policy rationale\u2014consumer harm, developer exclusion, alignment with EU precedent\u2014to impose these conduct remedies. However, history shows Apple rigorously resists and delays, exploiting all appeals and technical pretexts (privacy/security, etc.) and can sometimes protract implementation for quarters even after decisions. The news suggests that the final method of damages calculation and appeal is being heard in November, so we may see new requirements formalized near 2025 year-end at the earliest\u2014possibly with implementation deadlines trailing into 2026. On the other hand, the political and media climate\u2014plus the fact that technical capacity exists for Apple to enable sideloading in other regions\u2014means that, if final conduct remedies are imposed, rapid rollout is at least technically feasible. Given the intense confluence of legal defeat, SMS designation, developer/consumer pressure, spillover from the EU, and a rare period of cross-jurisdictional regulatory consensus, the probability is now distinctly above 50%. Yet, the possibility of final implementation slippage (even by weeks) or successful legal delay by Apple prior to Jan 1, 2026, means certainty is not warranted. Calibrating all factors, the odds are better than even, but nowhere near 90%.",

Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s historical pattern is to delay until absolutely compelled (see the EU DMA sequence) and defend on security/UX grounds. The recent \u00a32bn tribunal fine underscores mounting pressure, but legal appeals and final remedies remain pending into November and likely beyond. Engineering adaptation of iOS for UK-specific compliance may require further software releases or configuration changes, which are unlikely to be rushed through during ongoing litigation. With a little over two months until resolution, it is highly probable that Apple will not enable sideloading or other app stores in the UK by 1 January 2026\u2014unless forced by an unforeseen, rapid regulatory action. Base rates for Apple capitulating ahead of enforceable, EU-like deadlines are low, and the procedural status in the UK lags 6\u201312 months behind the EU, which itself saw lengthy negotiations.

This is consistent with their recent approach elsewhere, and matches the short time left for compliance action to translate into user-available sideloading in the UK. There are credible reports of regulatory momentum but no tangible sideloading/other app store availability for UK iPhones prior to resolution date.",

This could happen if Apple anticipates defeat and adopts an EU-compliant stance to avoid further fines.",
            "final_reasoning": "Historically, Apple only opens up its iOS ecosystem under direct, imminent regulatory compulsion\u2014and does so grudgingly, with maximal delay, legal contestation, and technical friction. In the EU, despite the DMA's clear requirements, Apple initially adopted high-friction compliance and secured significant delays, facing ongoing litigation and negotiation. For the UK, the situation is shifted by the very recent (Oct 2025) flurry of strong regulatory and judicial blows: multi-billion pound fines, SMS designation, draft proposals for mandatory opening, and explicit alignment with the EU's goals. However, the decisive factor is the timeline: as of late October 2025, the CMA has not yet published binding conduct requirements, Apple is appealing tribunal losses with a major hearing in November, and\u2014unlike in the EU, where a long run-up plus a fixed March 2024 DMA deadline forced Apple's hand\u2014there is simply insufficient time (8 weeks) for final orders, implementation, and actual availability to users. All historical precedent (including in Korea, Japan, US, even EU) indicates Apple will utilize every procedural tool to run out the clock before the deadline. Unless the CMA or courts act with unprecedented swiftness and specificity, sideloading/third-party app store support will not actually arrive for end users on UK iPhones before Jan 1, 2026. Nevertheless, the probability should not be too low (<10%), as regulatory intent is unmistakable and there is a nonzero chance that UK authorities leapfrog the usual process, especially if Apple signals willingness to pre-emptively roll out changes. However, base rates, timing constraints, and Apple's established resistance tactics lead me to assign a probability only modestly above 10%, but below the neutral midpoint.",

Apple\u2019s repeated losses in UK and EU courts, the magnitude of fines at stake, and successful campaign by developer/consumer groups have eroded the company\u2019s ability to use legal delay-tactics, and its prior technical adaptations for the EU minimize switching costs for compliance. While Apple\u2019s historic MO is to resist and delay, it consistently relented when faced with existential fines, meaningful legal loss, and aligned multi-jurisdictional pressure (see US/EU charger standardization, privacy). The only plausible countervailing force that would keep Apple from complying is a sudden, dramatic reversal by the CMA\u2014contradicted by all recent moves.

Furthermore, the EU's experience is an instructive analogy: even Apple could not resist the combined pressure there, and UK regulators are consciously referencing the DMA. The key risk is Apple running out the clock\u2014leveraging the need for regulatory consultations and appeals to delay compliance. However, news reports as of late October 2025 indicate the UK CMA now has both the legal mandate and the will, industry and consumer group support is vocal, and the technical obstacle (after EU implementation) is greatly reduced. Given the binary resolution criterion (credible reports of straightforward sideloading or alternate app stores), and given that credible reports often emerge as soon as Apple even announces compliance plans (not waiting for 100% technical rollout), the odds favor a Yes outcome, but the short timeline makes a modest tempering prudent. Accounting for Apple's incentive to push back, recent regulatory/judicial momentum, and the platform economics, I estimate a high but not extreme probability of Yes.",

However, the probability is not maximal because (a) Apple is vigorously appealing, (b) there's little evidence the actual enabling features are live or even imminently available in the UK, and (c) tactical delays are Apple's hallmark.

Given substantial evidence of regulatory intent, the short time remaining, and Apple's pattern of grudging compliance when all legal options are exhausted, I assess it as near-even odds.

You paint the picture of UK regulators as if ready to flip a compliance switch, but the DMCC\u2019s bespoke remedies, ongoing appeal cycles, and the absence (as of late October) of any published, binding conduct requirements or technical implementation timeline means the probability that UK consumers can actually sideload before Jan 1, 2026, is overstated. Apple\u2019s EU DMA rollout is not a precise blueprint: It was both delayed and intensely geo-fenced, full of legalistic caveats, and remains contested. The odds that Apple would proactively extend such changes to the UK preemptively\u2014before final legal exhaustion or the threat of day-one, on-the-ground enforcement\u2014is low, especially when appeals and consultative wrangling still provide cover. Even clear regulatory intent does not mechanically create real user-facing change with world-class stalling in play. By giving so much weight to recent UK regulatory 'will', you underplay the mechanics of actual remedy imposition and implementation lag, overvaluing momentum while undervaluing Apple\u2019s process game.

Where you see only inertia, you miss that rapid mainstream adoption is often triggered at the late 'early majority' phase when a tipping point is reached\u2014not merely by regulatory deadlines but by the sharply escalating cost of non-compliance. With the DMCC Act in force and multibillion-pound fines in play, Apple\u2019s resistance calculus is shifting. Furthermore, media coverage moves swiftly when court results and regulatory outcomes are this high-profile, meaning even an eleventh-hour compliance rollout could generate the required 'credible reports.' Yes, Apple fights to the end, but when the end comes, it has shown it CAN (and does) pivot rapidly if the market and legal context change. Don't anchor entirely on past lags in other markets; the combination of technical readiness and intensified UK pressure makes the substantial likelihood of a pre-2026 rollout more probable than your overly conservative base rate allows."

(2) The lone very high forecast (90%) is poorly supported, as it overweights regulatory signaling and underweights the actual speed of enforceable, on-the-ground change required to meet the resolution criteria (credible media reports about working UK sideloading, not just announcements or legal threats). (3) The most persuasive counterweight to my earlier optimism is the high likelihood of implementation slippage into early 2026, even if the legal framework compels Apple and the CMA is aggressive\u2014since both procedural/consultation lags and Apple\u2019s appeals are now well-documented bottlenecks. (4) My critique of the 90% forecast clarifies why an extremely high probability is out of step, but it also forces me to recognize that my own 65% may slightly underplay the risk of direct slippage past the deadline. I maintain that the regulatory squeeze is at an all-time high, but taking the group's base rate thinking together with Apple's extraordinary record of slowing rollouts until the last minute, I now believe I was 10-15 percentage points too high. Realistically, regulatory and technical coordination\u2014given the dates\u2014likely means sideloading/alternative app stores will not be reported live before January 1, 2026, though some probability for a last-minute UK move remains.

While a handful of forecasters pitch modestly higher odds (~15-25%) due to the possibility of a preemptive move or 'last-minute' regulatory flex, the bulk of genuinely process-aware reasoning pegs the expectation at low teens or even single digits, precisely because of the UK's methodical, consultative, and cautious approach, and Apple's highly documented history of resisting until the brink and no further.

The original question opened on 2023-02-19 15:55:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/14135). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn 14 September 2022 the [Regulation 2022/1925 on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (better known as the Digital Markets Act or DMA) was adopted](https://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/cl5qyuy0o1h0y0a59y4osbiqx/digital-markets-act-is-adopted). Its primary aim are issues regarding [contestability and fairness in the digital economy](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/digital-markets-act-dma-goes-live), with a focus on prohibitions and obligations imposed upon Big Tech. The DMA impacts a wide variety of companies such as Amazon, Google, or Apple, with an anticipated enforcement date of March 2024.\n\nThe [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/0c2d56f7-a402-45ea-8aa6-0e05e6260b68) reported that the DMA represents the \u201cbiggest threat to [Apple\u2019s] control over its operating system in 15 years\u201d. \n\n> Apple is laying the groundwork to comply with tough new EU rules that will allow iPhone users to pick apps from beyond its own App Store, as developers seek to skirt the up to 30 per cent fee imposed by the US tech giant.\n\nThis comes against the backdrop of Apple\u2019s legal fight with Fortnite maker Epic Games about Epic\u2019s own app store that resulted in Apple pulling Fortnite from their App Store. The DMA may make it illegal for Apple to prohibit other app stores on their phones.\n\nHowever, as the [Financial Times]( https://www.ft.com/content/0c2d56f7-a402-45ea-8aa6-0e05e6260b68) reports, a potential workaround for Apple could be \u201csideloading\u201d, where users are able to install software directly via a browser (without using rival app stores). \n\nWhile the DMA only applies to the EU, there is also the possibility of a regulatory spill-over to other jurisdictions.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":14135,\"question_id\":14138}}`",

The Commission has opened around twenty investigations under the DSA and DMA, but cases involving U.S. firms\u2014especially those opened before Trump\u2019s 2024 election\u2014proceed slowly. For instance, Meta was found in October 2024 to have violated the DSA by failing to process user-reported illegal content, lacking transparency in content removal, and providing inadequate access to data for researchers\u2014yet no substantial penalties have been issued. Similarly, X (formerly Twitter) was found to breach DSA rules in July 2024 regarding misleading blue verification badges and advertising transparency, but the Commission has delayed imposing fines, citing modest penalties and a preference for dialogue over punishment. The EU has also refrained from enforcing strict compliance deadlines, with Apple and Meta exceeding the 60-working-day window for corrective actions without facing daily fines. The Commission justifies this cautious approach by citing the need for legal robustness to avoid losing cases in the Court of Justice of the EU and by balancing geopolitical pressures, including U.S. threats of tariffs and the need to maintain transatlantic cooperation on Ukraine. The departure of combative former commissioner Thierry Breton and the appointment of more conciliatory Finnish official Henna Virkkunen in December 2024 further signal a shift in tone. While the EU claims to uphold its digital sovereignty, its enforcement remains inconsistent, especially when confronting American tech giants, with penalties remaining relatively low compared to past antitrust actions. The Commission faces mounting pressure to act decisively, particularly on long-standing DMA investigations into Apple and Google, as delays risk legal challenges from the European Parliament and undermine the credibility of EU digital regulation.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2025/10/24/face-a-la-big-tech-americaine-l-union-europeenne-applique-ses-regles-avec-parcimonie_6649163_3234.html)\n\n**Regulatory Overhaul of Major Platforms: UK and EU Actions Signal Global Shift in Digital Market Competition**\nThe UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has issued new decisions targeting Apple and Google's dominant positions in mobile operating systems, app stores, and browsers.

According to Prof. Dr. Emin K\u00f6ksal, a faculty member at Bah\u00e7e\u015fehir University and Associate Editor of the journal *Competition & Regulation in Network Industries*, the CMA's designation of Google and Apple as 'Strategic Market Status' (SMS) entities with new obligations is a clear sign of regulatory determination. This move parallels the EU's DMA, which designates large tech companies as 'gatekeepers' and imposes requirements such as allowing alternative app stores and enabling user choice of browsers and search engines. K\u00f6ksal emphasized the urgency for Turkey to enact its own digital market regulation draft, inspired by the EU\u2019s DMA, which includes ex-ante (pre-emptive) obligations like prohibitions on self-preferencing, data integration limits, and mandatory support for alternative app stores, with fines up to 10% of global turnover for violations. He noted that Turkey's recent 5G spectrum auction, completed for approximately $3 billion, will deliver internet speeds 10 times faster than 4.5G by 2026, enabling innovations in smart factories, autonomous vehicles, and telemedicine. However, he warned that technological infrastructure alone is insufficient unless paired with fair and competitive market rules, stating that just as building a fast highway is vital, so is establishing traffic rules to prevent monopolistic control\u2014otherwise, the benefits of advanced infrastructure will concentrate in the hands of a few dominant platforms.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 08:28 AM\nSource:[Haber7](https://ekonomi.haber7.com/ekonomi/haber/3574033-buyuk-platformlarda-rekabet-kurallari-guncelleniyor)\n\n**UK Antitrust Court Targets Apple\u2019s App Store: Up to \u00a32 Billion Fine Imposed**\nThe UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) has ruled that Apple abused its dominant market position between 2015 and 2020 by imposing excessive and unjustified commissions\u201430% instead of a fair 17.5%\u2014on app developers through the App Store. The decision could result in fines of up to \u00a32 billion (\u20ac2.3 billion) for Apple. The case was initiated by academic Rachael Kent on behalf of millions of UK iPhone and iPad users, who allege Apple blocked competition in app distribution and in-app purchases, enabling the company to generate what the tribunal deemed exorbitant profits. The tribunal found that developers were overcharged by approximately 12.5 percentage points, with half of this overcharge passed on to consumers. Apple has announced it will appeal the ruling, arguing the decision is based on a flawed understanding of the competitive app economy, particularly by downplaying the role of Android. However, the tribunal notes that on iOS devices, the App Store remains the only legal avenue for app distribution\u2014except in the EU under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple maintains that the App Store supports developers and provides users with a 'safe and reliable' environment. The case is significant because the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recently granted Apple and Google 'Strategic Market Status' (SMS) for their mobile platforms, including operating systems, app distribution, and mobile browsers\u2014empowering the CMA to impose targeted measures to ensure fair competition.

This move, part of the CMA's designation of Apple and Google with 'strategic market status,' aims to increase competition, lower prices, and boost innovation. The CMA argues that allowing sideloading\u2014installing apps from outside the App Store\u2014would give users more freedom and developers more opportunities. Apple opposes the proposal, warning that it could compromise user privacy and security, citing its rigorous app review process and risks like malware and fake apps. Apple points to its experience under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), where limited sideloading was introduced, but still cautions against broader access. This regulatory push is part of a global trend, including the EU's DMA and US antitrust actions, aimed at curbing tech monopolies. If enforced, the CMA's rules could lead to more flexible app ecosystems and fairer pricing, but Apple may face fines or penalties if it resists. The outcome will determine whether iPhone users gain more control over their devices or if Apple maintains its tightly managed ecosystem.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[Pulse Nigeria](https://www.pulse.ng/articles/lifestyle/apple-open-iphones-to-other-app-stores-2025102316000481907)\n\n**Apple Faces Antitrust Complaint in EU Over App Store Terms Amid DMA Enforcement**\nApple has been the subject of an antitrust complaint filed by two civil rights groups, Article 19 and the German Civil Rights Society, with the European Union's competition authorities on October 22, 2025. The complaint alleges that Apple\u2019s App Store terms and conditions violate the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to regulate dominant tech firms and promote fair competition. The groups argue that Apple\u2019s requirements, particularly a standby letter of credit (SBLC) of \u20ac1 million for developers seeking to distribute apps or install third-party app stores on iOS and iPadOS, create excessive financial barriers that disproportionately affect small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Apple rejected the allegations as false, claiming the European Commission is dictating how it must operate its App Store and imposing confusing commercial terms harmful to users and developers. Apple also stated it had previously notified the Commission of its plans to introduce additional flexibility in credit requirements but was instructed not to proceed. The European Commission confirmed it is aware of the complaint and is actively analyzing feedback from market participants on Apple\u2019s commercial terms, while also monitoring compliance with DMA rules. The DMA prohibits certain practices by gatekeepers and mandates interoperability and fair access for competitors. The complainants are urging the Commission to impose fines on Apple, which could reach up to 10% of its global annual revenue, following a prior \u20ac500 million fine imposed in April 2025 for DMA violations.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 11:33 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/apple-e-alvo-de-queixa-antitruste-na-ue-sobre-termos-da-app-store,2b08f84bf58546515f52462329c7d424coabd9ep.html)\n\n**Apple Threatens to Pull Key iPhone Privacy Feature in Europe Amid Regulatory Pressure**\nApple has warned it may remove its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy feature from European iPhone users due to intense regulatory pressure from German, Italian, and French authorities. The company cited ongoing antitrust investigations, particularly by Germany\u2019s Federal Cartel Office (FCO), which concluded in February 2025 that ATT\u2019s design may violate competition law by allowing Apple to collect user data across its ecosystem while requiring third-party apps to seek consent. Italy\u2019s AGCM is also investigating, with a final decision expected by October 31, 2025. France\u2019s Competition Authority fined Apple \u20ac150 million in March 2025 over ATT\u2019s implementation. This comes amid broader regulatory setbacks: a UK tribunal ruled Apple\u2019s 30% App Store fee is 'excessive and unfair,' and the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) granted Apple 'Strategic Market Status' under the DMCC Act, enabling stricter oversight. Apple argues that removing ATT or complying with new rules would compromise user privacy, security, and the seamless iOS experience, but European officials, including EU digital affairs spokesman Thomas Regnier, reject this, stating that the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) does not require lowering privacy or security standards. The conflict reflects a deepening divide between Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem model and Europe\u2019s push for digital competition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Winbuzzer](https://winbuzzer.com/2025/10/24/apple-threatens-to-pull-key-iphone-privacy-feature-in-europe-amid-regulatory-pressure-xcxwbn/)\n\n**Apple Faces Legal Blow in UK and Escalating Regulatory Pressure in Europe**\nApple faced a significant legal setback in the UK after losing an antitrust lawsuit, with the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal ruling that the company abused its dominant position in the iOS app market by imposing excessive and unfair fees on developers via the App Store. The tribunal found Apple holds 'near-total market power' in distributing iPhone apps and in-app payments, giving it excessive control over the app ecosystem. According to a Financial Times report, Apple may be required to pay \u00a31.5 billion in compensation to approximately 36 million UK users, with a follow-up hearing scheduled next month to determine the exact calculation method. Apple has announced its intention to appeal the decision, arguing the ruling ignores the App Store\u2019s positive role in supporting developers and consumers, and emphasizing that the platform faces strong competition while remaining the most secure and reliable app download source. Simultaneously, Apple is escalating its legal and public relations campaign against the European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to curb the dominance of tech giants and ensure fair competition. During a hearing at the Luxembourg Court, Apple\u2019s legal team described the DMA as imposing excessive, intrusive burdens that stifle innovation and threaten user privacy. Key objections include mandatory compatibility with third-party devices like headphones and smartwatches, allowing alternative app stores, and opening iMessage to competitors. The European Commission strongly rebutted these claims, asserting Apple maintains 'absolute control over its closed ecosystem' and that the DMA\u2019s goal is to 'break this control to foster a more competitive digital environment.' These developments mark unprecedented regulatory pressure on Apple from both the UK and EU, with authorities accusing the company of leveraging its economic power to maintain a monopoly over iOS and the App Store. Despite Apple\u2019s defense centered on 'privacy and security,' European governments appear determined to force the company to open its platforms to competition, potentially leading to fundamental changes in how Apple manages its digital services in the coming years.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 02:02 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/10/24/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%82%D9%89-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%82%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%89/7169903)\n\n**Facing American Big Tech, the EU Applies Its Rules with Caution**\nThe European Union's digital legislation, including the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), is being implemented with caution by Ursula von der Leyen's Commission, amid fears of retaliatory measures from Donald Trump\u2019s potential second term in the U.S. Despite the legal framework being in force since 2023, enforcement has been slow and lenient, particularly against American Big Tech companies like Google, Apple, Meta, and X.

The Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that Apple abused its dominant market position by imposing a 30% commission fee on app developers, which it passed on to consumers. The lawsuit, filed by British academic Rachel Kent on behalf of 20 million iPhone and iPad users in the UK, argued that the fee structure is excessive, despite Apple\u2019s claim that 85% of developers pay nothing. The ruling entitles UK users to damages, with potential payouts of around \u00a375 ($100) per person if all claims are made.

This designation, not a finding of wrongdoing, activates the CMA\u2019s power to impose bespoke 'conduct requirements' to promote competition and innovation in the UK\u2019s mobile ecosystem. The move follows a lengthy investigation, including provisional findings against Apple\u2019s browser restrictions in November 2024 and a critical report on the mobile browser duopoly in March 2025. The scope covers iOS, Android, their app stores, and core browsers (Safari/Chrome) and engines (WebKit/Blink). The CMA emphasized the sector\u2019s economic significance, noting the app economy contributes 1.5% of the UK\u2019s GDP and supports approximately 400,000 jobs. Will Hayter, CMA Executive Director for Digital Markets, stated the need for markets to work well for businesses. Unlike the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), the DMCC Act allows targeted, company-specific interventions, which the CMA argues are more proportionate. Apple and Google immediately criticized the decision, warning of weakened privacy and security, delayed feature rollouts, and a fragmented user experience. Apple cited its August 2024 submission, arguing forced interoperability would undermine its security model. Google\u2019s Oliver Bethell called the designation 'disappointing, disproportionate and unwarranted,' asserting Android was designed for choice and that the market remains competitive. News publishers, represented by the News Media Association (NMA), welcomed the move but urged swift implementation, citing exploitative in-app purchase fees of up to 30% as a key concern. The UK\u2019s approach aligns with global regulatory trends, including EU actions against Google and US antitrust cases. The CMA will now consult on specific conduct requirements, potentially including allowing alternative browser engines on iOS and restricting developer steering of users to external payment systems.

The complaint alleges that Apple\u2019s App Store terms and conditions violate the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to regulate dominant tech firms and promote fair competition. The groups argue that Apple\u2019s requirements, particularly a standby letter of credit (SBLC) of \u20ac1 million for developers seeking to distribute apps or install third-party app stores on iOS and iPadOS, create excessive financial barriers that disproportionately affect small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Apple rejected the allegations as false, claiming the European Commission is dictating how it must operate its App Store and imposing confusing commercial terms harmful to users and developers. Apple also stated it had previously notified the Commission of its plans to introduce additional flexibility in credit requirements but was instructed not to proceed. The European Commission confirmed it is aware of the complaint and is actively analyzing feedback from market participants on Apple\u2019s commercial terms, while also monitoring compliance with DMA rules. The DMA prohibits certain practices by gatekeepers and mandates interoperability and fair access for competitors. The complainants are urging the Commission to impose fines on Apple, which could reach up to 10% of its global annual revenue, following a prior \u20ac500 million fine imposed in April 2025 for DMA violations.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 11:33 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/apple-e-alvo-de-queixa-antitruste-na-ue-sobre-termos-da-app-store,2b08f84bf58546515f52462329c7d424coabd9ep.html)\n\n**Civil Rights Groups File EU Antitrust Complaint Against Apple Over App Store Terms**\nOn October 22, 2025, two civil rights groups\u2014Article 19 and the German Society for Civil Rights\u2014filed a joint complaint with the European Union\u2019s antitrust regulators against Apple, alleging that the company\u2019s App Store terms and conditions, iOS and iPadOS systems, violate the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The complaint claims Apple\u2019s practices restrict interoperability for small businesses, limit third-party app installations and app stores, and impose burdensome requirements such as a \u20ac1 million standby letter of credit (SBLC) for developers seeking to distribute apps or run third-party app stores on Apple devices. The groups argue this requirement creates an insurmountable financial barrier for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), violating the DMA\u2019s goal of fostering competition and user choice. Apple responded by calling the allegations false, stating the EU Commission is forcing commercial terms that confuse developers and harm users, and claiming it had already proposed additional flexibility on SBLC rules, which the Commission allegedly blocked. The European Commission confirmed it is aware of the complaint and is actively investigating, including seeking market feedback on Apple\u2019s commercial terms and monitoring compliance with DMA obligations. The DMA allows for fines of up to 10% of a company\u2019s global annual revenue.

Apple contested the 2023 decision labeling its iPhone software and App Store as core platform services, arguing that compliance with the DMA\u2019s interoperability requirements would compromise its intellectual property, privacy, and security. Apple attorney Daniel Beard claimed that exposing software code and trade secrets would amount to a 'deprivation of a key part of that right.' The European Commission countered that Apple had not identified any specific intellectual property at risk and emphasized that the DMA balances competition with fundamental rights. Intervening groups, including the European Parliament, the Council, Free Software Foundation Europe, and the Coalition for App Fairness, supported the Commission, stressing that interoperability is essential for fair competition. Disputes also centered on Apple\u2019s argument that its App Stores for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Watch, and TV serve distinct audiences and should not be treated as a single gateway\u2014contrary to the Commission\u2019s view that they function as one unified ecosystem. Additionally, the Commission\u2019s probe into iMessage as a 'number-independent interpersonal communications service' was challenged by Apple, which argued the app is free, ad-free, and non-commercial, thus not qualifying under the DMA. The Commission responded that iMessage indirectly boosts device sales and therefore falls under the law. The court examined whether the gatekeeper designation immediately imposes binding duties, with Apple claiming it does, and the Commission asserting that some aspects of the challenge involve preparatory steps without legal effect. A judgment is expected in 2026. The outcome will determine the extent of Apple\u2019s control over its App Store and devices, test the enforceability of the DMA, and set a precedent for other tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta. The case reflects a broader struggle over who defines fairness in the digital economy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 12:46 PM\nSource:[Court House News Service](https://www.courthousenews.com/apples-walled-garden-faces-european-court-challenge-to-its-digital-empire/)\n\n**Apple attacks EU crackdown in digital law's biggest court test - The Economic Times**\nApple Inc. launched a major legal challenge against the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU General Court, arguing that the law imposes 'hugely onerous and intrusive burdens' on its rights, particularly regarding interoperability mandates, App Store regulations, and a probe into iMessage. Apple's lawyer, Daniel Beard, claimed that the DMA threatens user privacy, security, and intellectual property rights, and challenged three key aspects: (1) obligations to ensure iPhone services work with rival hardware (e.g., earbuds, smartwatches); (2) the App Store\u2019s inclusion under the DMA, which led to a \u20ac500 million ($581 million) fine that Apple is contesting; and (3) the EU\u2019s attempt to investigate whether iMessage should be subject to DMA rules, despite not generating direct revenue. EU Commission lawyer Paul-John Loewenthal countered that Apple's 'absolute control' over its 'walled garden' ecosystem has enabled 'supernormal profits' and locked in over a third of European smartphone users. The case marks the most significant legal pushback against the DMA, following earlier setbacks for ByteDance over TikTok. Apple has previously faced \u20ac1.8 billion in antitrust penalties for app store practices and a \u20ac13 billion back-tax order from Ireland. Other tech giants\u2014including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Booking Holdings\u2014have also been affected by the DMA. The ruling will set a precedent for the enforcement of the EU\u2019s landmark digital competition law.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 11:13 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/apple-attacks-eu-crackdown-in-digital-laws-biggest-court-test/articleshow/124719977.cms)\n\n**Apple and Meta Near Breakthrough Deal with EU to Avoid Massive Fines**\nApple and Meta are on the verge of reaching a landmark agreement with the European Commission to resolve months-long regulatory disputes under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). According to reports by the Financial Times, Apple has agreed to modify App Store rules, including removing restrictions on steering users to external payment options and introducing a new fee structure: a 5% commission on purchases outside the App Store and a 'Core Technology Fee' for each annual app download exceeding one million installations. Meta is working on revising its advertising model to give users easier access to privacy-friendly ad options without requiring payment for an ad-free version. Although the deal has not yet been formally approved by Brussels, sources cited by FT indicate 'cautious optimism.' If finalized, the agreement could set a new benchmark for relations between 'big tech' firms and EU regulators. The Commission\u2019s more conciliatory stance may also reflect political considerations, as Donald Trump\u2014returning to the White House\u2014has previously criticized the EU for 'unfair treatment' of American companies, framing high fines and restrictions as economic protectionism. A successful deal could strengthen Brussels\u2019 negotiating position in future trade talks with the new U.S. administration. In April 2025, the European Commission imposed a \u20ac500 million fine on Apple for violating the 'steering' ban and a \u20ac200 million penalty on Meta for its 'consent or pay' model. Both companies appealed, arguing the Commission overstepped its authority and favored European and Chinese competitors. Meta called the penalties 'multibillion-euro tariffs' on American innovation. The DMA and Digital Services Act (DSA) are the two pillars of the EU\u2019s new digital regulatory framework. The DMA targets gatekeepers like Apple, Meta, Google, and Amazon by mandating fair competition, interoperability, and transparency\u2014requiring Apple to allow sideloading and Meta to offer real privacy choices. The DSA focuses on platform accountability for user-generated content, requiring rapid removal of illegal content, greater algorithmic transparency, and stronger consumer protection.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[nextgazetapl](https://next.gazeta.pl/next/7,151243,32312478,apple-i-meta-maja-dosc-gigantycznych-kar-przelomowe-porozumienie.html)\n\n**Report: Apple Nearing Agreement With EU Over App Store Rules**\nApple is reportedly nearing a settlement with the European Commission to resolve multiple antitrust investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aiming to avoid daily fines of up to 5% of its average global revenue. This follows a \u20ac500 million fine issued in April 2025 for violating the DMA\u2019s anti-steering provisions by restricting developers from directing users to external offers. The European Commission\u2019s investigation centers on Apple\u2019s App Store practices, particularly its control over payment systems and app distribution. In response, Apple introduced changes in June 2025, including allowing developers to promote alternative payment methods and distribute iOS apps through external marketplaces in the EU. However, ongoing talks focus on whether Apple\u2019s new developer contracts sufficiently remove barriers to fair competition, especially regarding developers\u2019 ability to communicate directly with users about external pricing without additional fees or restrictions. The DMA designates Apple as a 'gatekeeper' and mandates non-discrimination, fair access, and interoperability. Apple maintains it is already compliant and has appealed the initial ruling, arguing the Commission\u2019s interpretation exceeds the law\u2019s scope. The Commission continues gathering feedback from developers and stakeholders. Officials remain optimistic a resolution could be reached soon, with the outcome expected to significantly impact Apple\u2019s App Store operations in Europe.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 01:31 PM\nSource:[MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/08/apple-nearing-agreement-with-eu/)\n\n**Apple Urges EU to Abolish Digital Markets Act, Citing Innovation and User Safety Risks**\nApple has urged the European Commission to abolish the Digital Markets Act (DMA), arguing that the law fails to achieve its intended goals, harms European users, and stifles innovation within its technological ecosystem. The DMA, adopted by the European Union in 2022, aims to curb the dominance of major tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta, and promote competition with smaller firms. It grants the Commission broad powers to impose fines of up to 20% of global revenue for violations. Apple claims in its official consultation submission that the current DMA should be scrapped until a more suitable legislative tool is developed. The company argues that the law fails to balance competition protection with user safety, citing that its restrictions hinder innovation and delay the introduction of new technologies in Europe. Apple notes that compliance with DMA obligations has forced it to open certain system features to non-affiliated devices, causing delays in launching features such as real-time translation via AirPods and 'places visited' and 'preferred routes' in the Maps app\u2014features already available in other regions. The company also states that DMA mandates 'sideloading' (installing apps outside the official App Store) and allows alternative app markets and payment systems, which it claims increase user risks from fake apps, malware, and inadequate refund protections. This comes amid rising tensions, including a $587 million fine imposed by the EU in April 2025 for blocking developers from informing users about external offers. Apple called the fine 'unprecedented' and announced plans to appeal. Apple maintains that the DMA undermines the integrated user experience Apple users expect and delays access to new technologies, despite dedicating thousands of hours to compliance. The European Commission responded firmly, stating that compliance is a legal obligation, not optional. Analysts predict a prolonged legal battle, as Brussels insists the DMA protects competition and consumer rights, while Apple argues that the one-size-fits-all rules ignore differences in operating systems and may expose users to real risks.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0641\u062f](https://www.alwafd.news/5700142)\n\n**Europe's Digital Markets Act: Conflict and Confusion**\nThe European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), enacted three years ago, aims to regulate dominant tech 'gatekeepers'\u2014primarily American companies\u2014by requiring structural changes to promote competition. Under the DMA, Apple must reduce app store fees and allow third-party access to iOS; Google must stop favoring its own services in search; and Meta may need to offer a free, ad-free service. European regulators have already fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros and are preparing to penalize Google for noncompliance. The law has sparked transatlantic tensions: U.S. tech firms argue that DMA-mandated changes degrade product quality, compromise privacy and security, and delay European product launches. Apple delayed Live Translation and blocked iPhone Mirroring due to security concerns, while Google\u2019s inability to link directly to its Maps and travel sites has reportedly caused up to \u20ac114 billion in revenue losses, according to Alphabet\u2019s lawyer Oliver Bethell. Critics from both sides highlight enforcement gaps: competitors like Spotify claim Apple\u2019s compliance measures undermine the DMA\u2019s goal of consumer choice, while consumer groups such as BEUC call for faster enforcement. The European Commission is evaluating the DMA\u2019s effectiveness, with a recent consultation closing in September 2025. Despite calls from Apple and Google for repeal or reform, the Commission is likely to expand the law\u2019s scope to include cloud computing and AI services. Globally, the DMA has inspired similar laws in Japan, the UK, and other jurisdictions. Although the U.S. has not passed comparable legislation, federal antitrust actions against Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Google continue, with some cases seeking corporate breakup. The DMA enables faster regulatory action than traditional antitrust, but the required product changes are costly\u2014hundreds of thousands of engineering hours have been spent\u2014and often degrade user experience. The future remains uncertain: all three major tech firms are appealing fines and rulings to the European Court of Justice. Potential solutions include establishing an independent enforcement agency and expanding the DMA to cover AI and cloud services. The DMA continues to generate significant political, economic, and legal tension.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 07:51 PM\nSource:[CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/europes-digital-markets-act-conflict-and-confusion/)\n\n**Apple Claims EU Digital Market Rules Target It Unfairly**\nThe European Commission fined Apple \u20ac500\u202fmillion in April for violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a rule that requires so\u2011called \"gatekeepers\" to allow third\u2011party developers to inform users of alternative offers outside the App\u00a0Store.

The company argues that the DMA has been enforced to serve political agendas and has unfairly targeted it since the law took effect in early 2023. In a submission to the Commission\u2019s first DMA review questionnaire, Apple stated that the rules 'should be repealed while a more appropriate fit for purpose legislative instrument is put in place.' Apple also claimed that the Commission has been 'highly responsive to external pressures ... resulting in a disproportionate focus on Apple' and that it has treated the DMA as a weapon against the company.

It explains that the EU possesses the most powerful legal arsenal for digital regulation, having already imposed hefty fines on U.S. tech giants such as Meta and Apple. Brussels has refused to relax its two flagship laws \u2013 the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) \u2013 in trade negotiations with the United States.\n\nThe DSA aims to protect European users by imposing obligations on platforms, including:\n- establishing a reporting system for problematic content;\n- acting \"promptement\" to remove illicit content;\n- banning targeted advertising to minors.\nLarge platforms (X, TikTok, Meta, Apple, Google) face additional rules: they must assess risks related to illegal content, privacy, freedom of expression, health and public safety, and implement mitigation measures such as content moderation. They must also provide regulators and approved researchers with algorithmic access for compliance checks. Violations can lead to fines of up to 6\u202f% of annual turnover, and repeated serious breaches may result in a ban from operating in Europe.\n\nThe DMA seeks to end the dominant\u2011position abuse of tech giants (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) to protect startups and improve consumer choice. Key provisions include:\n- allowing users to uninstall pre\u2011installed services (browsers, maps, weather) and choose alternative app stores;\n- prohibiting cross\u2011platform data aggregation for targeted advertising without user consent.\nThe European Commission, with a team of about a hundred experts, holds enforcement power. Penalties can reach 10\u202f% of global turnover, and 20\u202f% for repeat offenders.\n\nThe article quotes the DSA\u2019s requirement for platforms to act \"promptement\" and highlights the EU\u2019s willingness to impose substantial fines, underscoring the tension between U.S. tech firms and European regulators.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Orange Actualit\u00e9s](https://actu.orange.fr/economie/les-puissantes-regles-de-l-ue-qui-encadrent-la-tech-et-agacent-trump-CNT000002klKeB.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether Apple will allow sideloading or other app stores on iPhones in the UK before 2026 show a clear split, closely tied to regulatory, legal, and timing dynamics. Forecasters emphasizing UK regulatory pressure, recent tribunal rulings, and strategic market status (SMS) designations note there is now unprecedented legal leverage on Apple to open iOS in the UK, mirroring the EU\u2019s DMA implementation. Many agree that Apple faces mounting pressure from the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), court-imposed fines, and strong policy intent to introduce sideloading or third-party app store requirements. However, those focused on litigation tactics, regulatory process inertia, and Apple\u2019s historical resistance highlight several barriers: namely, that conduct requirements are still under CMA consultation, Apple is actively appealing adverse judgments, and actual implementation of compelled changes often takes months more than expected. The impending January 1, 2026 resolution date is seen as too close to guarantee enactment, given UK regulators\u2019 bespoke approach, procedural delays, and Apple\u2019s ability to stall using court appeals and technical engineering lags. While a few experts, focusing on disruptive innovation or platform economics, see near certainty (70%\u201390%) that cumulative legal and regulatory threats will force Apple\u2019s hand just in time, the modal view is more cautious\u2014assigning 10\u201345% probability. They reason that, barring an extremely rapid regulatory intervention or unexpected voluntary compliance, Apple\u2019s standard delay tactics and the procedural slow pace in the UK will most likely prevent straightforward sideloading or non-Apple app store access being credibly reported to UK users before January 1, 2026. On balance, the expert consensus tilts slightly toward a 'No' outcome being more likely, but with a notably increased probability of 'Yes' compared to previous years, owing to dramatic escalation in UK legal and regulatory actions since late 2025.",
