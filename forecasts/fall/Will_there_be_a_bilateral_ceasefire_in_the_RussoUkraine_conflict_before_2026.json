Recent meetings have been tense, with both sides digging in. The resolution criteria (formal bilateral ceasefire, all territory, 30 days stable) are a much higher bar than typical local or humanitarian pauses possible through backchannel confidence-building. Globally, base rates for such a ceasefire to materialize and hold for 30 days on short notice, with this degree of unresolved asymmetry, are extremely low.

The diplomatic flurry increases pressures, but the comprehensive nature of the required ceasefire (all combatants, all sectors, minimum 30 days, no break in effectiveness) is a very high bar, especially given how partial ceasefire attempts have fared in this and similar wars. Past rounds of talks have failed over exactly these issues, and even 'hard' U.S. pressure has not aligned the parties (as shown by the tension and content of recent meetings). Given the impending deadline, base rates, and the depth of the obstacles discussed above, the chance of a bilateral ceasefire that satisfies all resolution criteria coming into effect and holding for 30 days before year's end is very low, though not absolutely zero. A last-minute freeze or Christmas truce effort is possible, but even then, holding 30 uninterrupted days is highly improbable given command and control challenges and the risk of spoilers.",

Russia wants not only consolidation but also guarantees of Ukrainian neutrality and demilitarization; it also questions Zelensky's negotiating legitimacy.

As per the base rate, true bilateral, formal ceasefires (not frozen conflicts or partial pauses) near the end of high-intensity wars are rare without one party collapsing. Timing further compounds the challenge: for a 30-day ceasefire to resolve 'Yes', an agreement needs to be reached imminently. High mutual mistrust, domestic constraints, and a history of broken agreements all act as headwinds.

Trump emphasized that 'enough blood has been shed' and called for both sides to claim victory and cease hostilities, asserting that the war 'would have never started if I were President.' He reiterated his position of resolving the conflict 'without thinking about Tomahawks,' following a UN meeting where Zelenskyy had requested the missiles. Trump also revealed plans for a future meeting with Putin in Budapest, Hungary, after negotiations involving Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In response, Zelenskyy, in an interview with NBC News, stated that Trump did not say 'yes' or 'no' to Tomahawks, suggesting that Putin fears their delivery and potential use.

Trump stated he 'strongly recommended' a deal where both sides 'declare victory' and emphasized that immediate cessation of hostilities along current frontlines was necessary to avoid further escalation. He dismissed the possibility of an upcoming trilateral meeting among U.S., Ukraine, and Russia leaders and downplayed the prospect of the U.S. providing Ukraine with 'Tomahawk' cruise missiles, warning such a move would 'escalate' the situation. Zelenskyy, when leaving the White House, responded with realism, stating he and Trump discussed the issue of long-range weapons and that Ukraine must make greater efforts to secure them. On territorial concessions, Zelenskyy described the matter as 'sensitive' and 'difficult.' On October 16, 2025, Trump held a two-hour call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, focusing on ending the war and post-conflict trade, and announced that the two leaders would meet in Budapest, Hungary, though no date was set. This would be their second meeting since August 2025, when they met in Alaska without reaching any agreement.

Trump confirmed he planned to hold a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, and ruled out a potential trilateral meeting involving the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, stating such talks might occur separately to ensure both sides feel comfortable. Trump praised Zelenskyy\u2019s attire, calling it 'very stylish,' and both leaders emphasized the importance of peace. Zelenskyy expressed openness to bilateral or trilateral talks and reiterated that Ukraine\u2019s priority is achieving a ceasefire and bringing Putin back to negotiations. He stressed that while NATO membership remains important, 'truly strong security guarantees' are critical, and a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. is vital. Trump did not commit to Ukraine\u2019s territorial demands, saying, 'Who knows?'\u2014a stance consistent with earlier statements where he had pressured Ukraine to make territorial concessions and later claimed Ukraine could 'regain all of Ukraine.'

Before the meeting, Zelensky stated that Trump 'has a great opportunity to end this war' and emphasized the importance of direct dialogue between Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow. When asked if Ukraine would make concessions, Zelensky replied that the priority is to 'sit down and talk' and establish a ceasefire, noting the difficulty of maintaining truces, as seen in the Middle East.

In September 2025, Trump stated he believed Ukraine could 'win all of Ukraine back in its original form,' a reversal from earlier calls for territorial concessions. The upcoming meeting with Zelensky is expected to focus on whether the U.S. will supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, capable of striking targets up to 2,500 km (1,500 miles) inside Russia. When asked about the possibility, Trump responded, 'We'll see... I may.' The Kremlin has not yet commented on the call.

U.S. media reported that the atmosphere during the meeting was 'tense,' with Trump refusing to supply Ukraine with 'Tomahawk' cruise missiles capable of reaching Moscow. Zelenskyy posted on social media that the discussion covered key issues including battlefield conditions, long-range strike capabilities, air defense deployments, and diplomatic prospects, and expressed hope that the U.S. would exert pressure on Russia. He also informed European leaders\u2014including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and leaders from the UK, Germany, Italy, Finland, Norway, and Poland\u2014about the talks, with their national security advisers to coordinate next steps. According to Axios, citing two informed sources, the meeting was marked by tension, with Trump stating he had no intention of providing long-range Tomahawk missiles 'at least for now.' The report noted that Zelenskyy had expected a commitment on Tomahawks but instead found Trump holding a 'completely different position,' likely influenced by Trump\u2019s previous lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN, citing multiple sources, described the meeting as 'tense and candid, even at times 'unsettling,' with Trump directly and frankly telling Zelenskyy that Ukraine would not receive the long-range missiles it urgently needs. Earlier that day, this marked Zelenskyy\u2019s third visit to the White House in 2025. After the meeting, Trump posted on social media urging a 'strong recommendation' for a ceasefire, with both sides 'declaring victory.' When asked if he was more optimistic about receiving Tomahawk missiles, Zelenskyy replied, 'I am a realist.'

The meeting, described as 'direct and candid' by CNN and characterized by tension and awkwardness by sources, centered on the future of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Trump stated that Ukraine and Russia should immediately cease hostilities along the current front lines, arguing that continuing the war would be too complex to resolve. He emphasized that both sides should return home, stop killing, and declare victory, leaving history to judge. Trump reiterated this stance on social media, 'strongly suggesting' a ceasefire with mutual recognition of victory. He also told Zelenskyy that Ukraine would not receive the long-range 'Tomahawk' missiles it sought, as the U.S. aims to avoid escalation. Zelenskyy described the meeting as 'sharp' but productive, acknowledging it helped bring the conflict closer to resolution. He stressed that negotiations on territorial issues\u2014the most difficult part\u2014must pause before resuming. Trump previously urged Ukraine to make territorial concessions, while also claiming in September that Ukraine could reclaim all its territory. On October 16, Trump had a lengthy call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, announcing plans for a future meeting in Budapest, Hungary.

One source said the meeting was 'not easy,' while another stated it 'went poorly.' During the meeting, Trump made several 'sharp statements,' and the atmosphere was 'quite emotional,' though no one shouted. One source noted that 'Trump was firm.' Trump reportedly emphasized the U.S. proposal for a diplomatic resolution based on freezing the front lines, a condition difficult for Ukraine to accept. This meeting followed a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, October 17, 2025. Moscow previously stated that the idea of freezing the conflict along the line of contact is unacceptable to Russia. In a December 2024 direct line, Putin stated that Russia seeks not a ceasefire but a 'solid peace' secured by reliable guarantees of security for the country and its citizens. In June 2024, Putin proposed a peace initiative: Russia would immediately cease fire and agree to negotiations after Ukrainian forces withdraw from newly annexed Russian territories. Additionally, he demanded Ukraine renounce NATO membership, undergo demilitarization and denazification, adopt a neutral, non-aligned, and nuclear-free status, and have sanctions against Russia lifted.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 01:30 AM\nSource:[EADaily](https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2025/10/18/axios-vstrecha-trampa-s-zelenskim-byla-neprostoy)\n\n**Zelenskyy's Third White House Visit in 8 Months: What Did He Discuss with Trump?**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived at the White House on October 17, 2025, for his third visit in eight months, meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Analysts believe the Trump administration aims to frame the Gaza ceasefire as a diplomatic achievement and hopes to advance progress on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the U.S. influence in bringing Russia back to the negotiating table remains limited. Zelenskyy confirmed his upcoming visit to the U.S. to discuss Ukrainian defense and pressure on Russia, following two prior phone calls with Trump. Trump stated he might inform Putin that if the war continues, he will provide Ukraine with 'Tomahawk' missiles, prompting Russia to express high concern and President Putin to warn that such a move would severely damage Russia-U.S. relations. During his return journey from the Middle East, Trump suggested Turkish President Erdogan could play a role in resolving the conflict, noting Erdogan's respect from Russia and their personal friendship. According to The Wall Street Journal, senior U.S. and European officials believe neither Russia nor Ukraine will change their war strategies due to the Gaza ceasefire. The long-term viability of a lasting peace agreement in Gaza remains uncertain. European officials hope the U.S. will pressure Russia to return to negotiations, but defense analyst Franz-Stephan Gadi argues that Trump\u2019s influence over Russia is limited. Gadi believes Trump is more likely to strike a direct deal with Putin and then demand Ukraine accept it\u2014consistent with Trump\u2019s past style\u2014though European leaders are actively trying to prevent such an outcome. Since returning to the White House in January 2025, Trump has consistently urged Ukraine to make territorial concessions in ceasefire talks. However, following a bilateral meeting with Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly on September 23, 2025, Trump claimed that, with EU and NATO backing, Ukraine now has a chance to 'reclaim all of Ukraine' and affirmed continued U.S. support for NATO arms supply.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20251014/48904010.html)\n\n**Trump aide sets new timeframe for ending Ukraine conflict  --  RT World News**\nUS special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff said Washington hopes to see the Ukraine conflict resolved by the end of 2025, citing Moscow's 'peace proposal on the table' and ongoing meetings with Russian and Ukrainian representatives. Speaking at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, Witkoff said he will be 'having meetings all this week' on Ukraine and other global conflicts, 'and we hope to settle them before the end of this year.' In a follow\u2011up interview with Fox News, Witkoff reiterated that the Russian side has at least 'put a peace proposal on the table' and that territorial concessions 'may not be something that the Ukrainians can take,' but argued that the Trump administration had brought the sides closer to agreement than ever before. He added, 'There's a peace proposal on the table,' 'We're at this place where we think the end is in sight... we have technical teams working on it and we're hopeful that by the end of this year, and maybe quite a bit sooner, we actually can find the ingredients to get to that peace deal.' According to Witkoff, President Putin expressed a clear desire to end the conflict and discussed Moscow's position in depth with Trump during a historic Alaska summit earlier this month. Moscow has long insisted that a sustainable settlement can only be achieved if Kiev agrees never to join NATO, undergoes demilitarization and denazification, and recognizes the new reality on the ground, including the status of Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye as part of Russia\u2014territories that voted to join the country in referendums in 2014 and 2022. Witkoff emphasized that any decision on territorial concessions would be for Ukraine to make and suggested the issue would be tied to long\u2011term security guarantees. He noted that he would meet Ukrainian officials in New York this week and stressed that Washington maintains daily communication with Moscow. Recent reports have indicated that ongoing discussions include Kiev potentially ceding its remaining positions in Donbass in exchange for yet\u2011to\u2011be\u2011defined Western commitments. Witkoff further claimed 'we may end up seeing a bilateral meeting' between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, adding that Trump might be 'needed at the table to finish a deal.' Putin has not ruled out meeting Zelensky, but insisted such a meeting could only follow tangible progress in negotiations. Moscow has also questioned Zelensky's legitimacy, citing his expired term and warning that any deals he signs could be overturned by his successor.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 27, 2025 12:23 AM\nSource:[RT](https://www.rt.com/news/623561-witkoff-ukraine-peace-deal/)\n\n**Does a 2\u2011Week Ceasefire Lead to Conclusion? Russia Demands Ukraine Give Up Donbas, Sign Agreement to Resolve Legitimacy Issues**\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that a cease\u2011fire between Russia and Ukraine could be known within about two weeks. If peace remains unlikely, he said he would consider other strategies and even hinted that Ukraine could launch an offensive against Russia on social media. According to exclusive sources quoted by Reuters, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s conditions for a peace agreement include Ukraine giving up the entire Donbas region, abandoning any NATO ambitions, staying neutral, and preventing Western forces from entering Ukraine. The conditions were reportedly agreed upon during a three\u2011hour closed\u2011door meeting at the Alaska Summit last week. Putin\u2019s latest demands are a compromise compared with a June\u202f2024 proposal that required Kyiv to relinquish four provinces \u2013 Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2013 and to withdraw from NATO. The new proposal would freeze the front lines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia if Ukraine fully withdrew from Donbas, and could involve handing over parts of Kharkiv, Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly rejected any territorial concessions, arguing that Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and the constitutional goal of NATO membership are essential for its survival. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on 21\u202fMay that any future agreement would first have to resolve the legitimacy of Zelensky, whose presidential term was due to end on 20\u202fMay\u202f2024 but has been extended by the war. Kyiv insists Zelensky remains the legitimate president, though some analysts say a future leader might challenge the agreement. The article was published on 22\u202fAugust\u202f2025.

Trump stated that there are 'reasonable chances' of ending the war in Ukraine following the meeting with Zelensky and European leaders. He believes that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky, as well as European leaders, want to end the conflict, but it is impossible to assess the timeframe. Trump promised to provide Ukraine with 'very good protection' in the framework of a peaceful resolution. However, he emphasized that there are no discussions about Ukraine's membership in NATO. Trump noted that Russia has been opposed to Ukraine's NATO membership long before Putin's presidency. 'There was a statement before President Putin that Ukraine has no place in NATO. This is a fact. We have not discussed it yet. We will discuss it today. We will give them good protection,' Trump said. Trump stated that a three-way meeting with Zelensky and Putin is necessary to end the war in Ukraine. If it does not happen, the conflict will continue. 'We (with Putin - ed.) are going to have a phone call immediately after today's meetings... he is waiting for my call when we finish this meeting. We may or may not have a three-way meeting. If we don't have a three-way meeting, the fighting will continue. If we do, I think we have a high chance of a possible end,' Trump said. Trump called the goal of the Ukrainian settlement a long-term peace, not a ceasefire. Zelensky stated at the meeting with Trump that for the conduct of presidential elections in Ukraine 'security conditions' are required. Zelensky did not answer the question of whether he is ready for territorial concessions. Commenting on the relevant question, the Ukrainian president generally stated that Kiev supports the US idea of ending the conflict. Zelensky also noted that Ukraine has problems with purchasing American weapons. When a journalist asked what security guarantees he wants from the US president (American troops, intelligence or weapons), Zelensky replied that 'everything'. He added that the security of Ukraine should consist of two parts - 'a strong Ukrainian army' and guarantees 'from the side of big countries', including the US.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 06:51 PM\nSource:[Tengrinews.kz](https://tengrinews.kz/world_news/ukraine-mesta-nato-tramp-zelenskiy-otvetili-voprosyi-578428/)\n\n**Zelensky Avoids Answer on Territorial Concessions, Promises Elections After Ceasefire**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has avoided giving a direct answer to the question of whether he is willing to make territorial concessions to Russia in order to reach a peace agreement. However, he has promised that elections will be held in Ukraine as soon as a ceasefire is established and the circumstances allow it. 'We live under constant Russian attacks. As you know, there have been many attacks and many injured, including a 1.5-year-old child who was killed. We need to end the war, stop Russia, and we need support,' Zelensky said in response to a reporter's question during his meeting with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. When asked if he would be willing to redraw the maps, Zelensky did not give a clear answer, instead trying not to offend his host. 'We need the support of the Americans and the Europeans. And that's what this is about. I think we've shown that we're a strong people and that we have the support of the American people and the President of the United States to end the war, to be able to make diplomatic efforts and end the war in a lasting way,' he said. Zelensky also promised that elections will be held in Ukraine as soon as a ceasefire is established and the circumstances are secure enough to allow it. 'We need security, a ceasefire on land, sea, and air, so that people can vote democratically. Hold open, free, and secret elections. During the war, you can't vote,' he replied to a journalist's question, while Trump joked that if the US were at war in 2028, he wouldn't need to hold elections. Both Trump and Zelensky have supported holding a trilateral meeting with the Russian president to try to close a peace agreement that would end the conflict in Ukraine, which began in February 2022. 'I think if everything goes well today, we'll have a (trilateral meeting) and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do it,' Trump emphasized in front of Zelensky, dressed in a suit, from the Oval Office. In this sense, Trump has urged working with both Kiev and Moscow to close an agreement that would allow ending the fighting on the Ukrainian front. 'We'll have a lasting peace. I hope it's immediate. I hope they won't have to continue (the attacks),' the US President argued. For his part, Zelensky said that Ukraine 'is ready' to hold a trilateral meeting. 'I think we've shown that we're strong people and we support the idea of the United States, personally of President Trump, of stopping this war,' he emphasized in statements to the press. Zelensky and Trump met on Monday at the White House after the US President met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska last Friday and put on the table the possibility of holding a trilateral summit to start negotiating a peace agreement for Ukraine.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 06:12 PM\nSource:[Diario de Noticias](https://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/mundo/2025/08/18/zelenski-evade-hablar-cesiones-territoriales-9992264.html)\n\n**Trump Shifts Focus in Russia-Ukraine Diplomacy, Putin Demands Control over Donbass**\nUS President Donald Trump has shifted his focus in the Russia-Ukraine diplomacy from an immediate ceasefire to bringing the two presidents, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, to the negotiating table for direct talks on peace. According to Axios, a US portal, Trump's advisors say that his central goal is to bring the two leaders together for a direct conversation about peace. Trump was criticized for unexpectedly backing down from his demand for an immediate ceasefire after the meeting with Putin in Alaska. Putin, on the other hand, has intensified the military pressure on Ukraine with attacks and territorial gains in order to have more influence in future negotiations. Trump's team reportedly sees the meeting with Zelensky in Washington as the next step in a new three-stage plan: bilateral talks with Putin, then with Zelensky, and finally a possible three-way meeting. However, it is unclear if this will happen. According to Axios, Trump nearly walked out of the meeting with Putin in Alaska when it came to the question of territorial concessions. Putin reportedly insisted that Russia should have control over the entire Donbass region, including areas in Donetsk that Moscow has not yet occupied. Trump allegedly told Putin, 'If it's about Donetsk and there are no concessions, we shouldn't just keep delaying this.' Putin then reportedly backed down from this demand. At the Alaska summit, Putin demanded full control over the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. The latter region is about three-quarters occupied by Russian troops. Russia also wants to annex the non-occupied parts of the region. However, it's only a matter of time before Donetsk falls under Russian control? US intelligence estimates are divided: some expect Russian capture of all of Donetsk by October, while others predict the continuation of the long war of attrition. As Trump and Putin did not answer questions from the press, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff took over the public statements. They emphasized that no border issues were discussed for Ukraine, but Trump represents Kiew's interests. Putin agreed for the first time that the US and European partners could provide security guarantees. However, it remains unclear if this includes US troops in Ukraine. Rubio warned in US television that the war will only get bloodier. Only Trump can bring the two presidents together, he said.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 04:48 PM\nSource:[Der Tagesspiegel](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/internationales/streit-uber-gebietsabtretungen-der-ukraine-trump-soll-kurz-davor-gewesen-sein-das-gesprach-mit-putin-abzubrechen-14194949.html)\n\n**US-Russia Mediation Efforts: A Complex Dance of Diplomacy and Strategic Interests**\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris confirmed that the US is actively coordinating arrangements for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the ongoing three-and-a-half-year conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This move marks a significant breakthrough in the US and Russia's efforts to facilitate direct dialogue between the two countries' leaders since the conflict began. Previously, Putin had stated that he would not negotiate with Zelensky, while Zelensky and his European allies have expressed concerns that the peace process may bypass Kyiv and reach a compromise. Harris revealed that the US is evaluating the feasibility of a three-way meeting between the leaders, aiming to determine the meeting time, agenda, and ceasefire framework. US President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin on August 15 in Alaska to focus on Ukraine-related negotiations. Harris emphasized that arranging a direct meeting between Russian and Ukrainian leaders before the US-Russia talks would not be constructive, suggesting that the US wants to lay the groundwork for future three-way talks through US-Russia dialogue. A White House official revealed that Trump initially favored a three-way summit, but the Kremlin insisted on prioritizing a bilateral meeting, and Russia has since provided a list of potential ceasefire demands, which the US is trying to secure support from Ukraine and its European allies. The US has complex strategic intentions, seeking to alleviate domestic pressure on Ukraine aid and accelerate its strategic shift to the Asia-Pacific to counter China's rise. Facilitating a Russian-Ukrainian ceasefire could free up NATO forces and equipment, while avoiding conflict spillover and global energy and food crises affecting Asia-Pacific supply chains. Additionally, the Trump administration is attempting to shape its 'peace broker' international image through mediation and negotiations, accumulating political capital for the 2024 presidential election. The Trump administration has proposed a contentious 'land for peace' scheme, but Zelensky has firmly rejected territorial concessions, emphasizing that peace must be based on restoring the pre-2022 conflict boundaries. Currently, Russian forces control the eastern front and key industrial and resource areas, making them more inclined to consolidate their gains in negotiations. Putin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Crimea's annexation, the autonomy of four eastern provinces, and its commitment to never join NATO, while Ukraine insists on recovering lost territory and obtaining NATO security guarantees, highlighting the fundamental conflict that cannot be easily resolved.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 01:30 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20250816/48726202.html)\n\n**US Diplomat Wans Makes 'Significant Progress' in Ukraine Conflict Resolution**\nAccording to reports, a long meeting between US diplomat Wans and several European security advisors, Ukrainian officials, and former Ukrainian Defense Minister Rostom Umerov made 'significant progress' in achieving the goal of resolving the crisis set by US President Donald Trump. The meeting, which took place on Saturday, included UK Foreign Secretary David Rami, Wans, several European security advisors, Ukrainian Office Director Andrei Yermak, and former Ukrainian Defense Minister Rostom Umerov. As reported by The New York Times, the representatives from Brussels and Kiev requested security guarantees from Washington as part of a future peace agreement. Additionally, Axios reported that they considered an immediate ceasefire as the first step towards reconciliation, and that Ukraine should not be forced to give up territory in exchange for a ceasefire. Kremlin and White House previously announced that Putin and Trump will meet on August 15 in Alaska. Russian Presidential Assistant Usakov stated that US Special Envoy Witkov proposed a three-party meeting between Putin, Trump, and Zelensky during his visit to Russia, but Russia did not comment on this proposal, suggesting that they focus on preparing for a bilateral meeting. Putin stated on August 7 that a meeting with Zelensky is possible, but it requires conditions, and it is still far from creating such conditions. Zelensky, citing the Ukrainian Constitution, stated that Ukraine will not make concessions on territorial issues before the meeting between US and Russian leaders.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 11, 2025 05:43 AM\nSource:[sputniknews.cn](https://sputniknews.cn/20250811/1066803626.html)\n\n**Trump's Envoy Meets with Putin, Seeks Ceasefire in Ukraine**\nUS President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, two days before the end of the 10-day ultimatum given by Trump for a ceasefire. Trump stated that the meeting was 'very productive' and that 'great progress was made.' The meeting was seen as a last-minute attempt by Putin to offer a long-term ceasefire in the air to Trump. According to sources, Putin's proposal would require Ukraine to agree to the ceasefire, and if accepted, both sides would stop launching drones and missiles at each other's territories from the front lines starting next week. The Russian side's stance also indicates that they are willing to continue bilateral talks with Ukraine in Istanbul. Putin has demanded that the three commissions established for the Trump-Putin-Zelenski-Erdo\u011fan summit in Istanbul complete all preparations for the summit. Russia continues to demand that Ukraine cede control of the Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporojye, and Herson regions, as well as Crimea, which they claim will be Russian territory after the war. Additionally, Russia has insisted that Ukraine will never join NATO and must be disarmed. Putin's special envoy, Kiril Dmitriyev, stated that 'everything can be solved through dialogue' after the meeting. Trump also announced that he had informed some European countries about the meeting. Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski stated that he had spoken with Trump over the phone and that 'our allies are united in their stance that the war must end.' He also thanked the European leaders who participated in the call. A White House official stated that Trump and Putin could meet face-to-face next week, but US Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied that the two leaders had planned any meetings. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that 'we have reached an important stage in the crisis' and that the 6-point plan proposed by China and Brazil in 2024 is being implemented. The plan includes unconditional and reciprocal ceasefire, and a conference involving all parties, but does not mention Ukraine's territorial integrity.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[H\u00fcrriyet](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/rus-lider-putin-trumpin-temsilcisi-witkoffu-kabul-etti-moskovada-savas-ve-baris-ziyareti-42905532)\n\n**Expectativa para terceira rodada de negocia\u00e7\u00f5es entre ucranianos e russos**\nUkrainian and Russian negotiators may meet in Istanbul on Wednesday (23) for a third round of peace talks, under pressure from the US government to announce a ceasefire. Russia has not confirmed whether it will send a delegation to the Turkish city and has ruled out any 'miraculous progress' in case the meeting takes place. The Russian invasion, which began in February 2022, has devastated large areas of southern and eastern Ukraine, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians. The two sides have organized bilateral meetings in May and June, the first since 2022, but have failed to reach a ceasefire agreement after almost three and a half years of war. The positions are far apart, with Russia demanding the four partially occupied Ukrainian regions it claims to have annexed in September 2022. Ukraine rejects negotiating territorial concessions before establishing a ceasefire and insists that it will never recognize Russia's claims to occupied territory, including the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hopes the third meeting will focus on the release of prisoners and prepare a meeting between him and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. However, the Kremlin insists that 'much work' is still needed before addressing a possible meeting between the two presidents, who have not met face-to-face since 2019. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there is 'no reason to expect miraculous progress' in any potential meeting. 'But we intend to defend our interests, guarantee them, and fulfill the objectives we established from the beginning,' he declared. The Ukrainian delegation will be led by former Defense Minister and current Security Council Secretary Rustem Umerov. In previous rounds, the Kremlin sent former Culture Minister and nationalist historian Vladimir Medinsky as the main negotiator, considered by Kiev to be a puppet without decision-making power. The two previous meetings resulted in a large-scale prisoner exchange agreement. The two countries also exchanged their respective drafts of conditions to end the conflict, which, according to the Kremlin, were 'diametrically opposed.' The impasse in the negotiations is frustrating US President Donald Trump, who promised to end the conflict quickly during his election campaign. Last week, the Republican gave Russia a 50-day deadline to conclude a peace agreement under the threat of imposing harsh sanctions. Despite the pressure, Russia has intensified bombing of Ukraine in recent weeks and has claimed advances in different points on the front line. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked the parties last month not to 'close the door to dialogue.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 23, 2025 09:07 AM\nSource:[ISTO\u00c9 Independente](https://istoe.com.br/expectativa-para-terceira-rodada-de-negociacoes-entre-ucranianos-e-russos/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the probability of a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict before 2026 is considered low, generally ranging from 6% to a high of 20%. Every expert emphasizes that although diplomatic activity has heightened\u2014especially given U.S. President Trump's high-profile mediation\u2014the fundamental obstacles remain largely unchanged: Russia continues to demand Ukrainian territorial concessions, neutrality, and the renunciation of NATO ambitions, while Ukraine refuses any terms involving territorial or sovereignty compromise. Domestic political constraints, deep mutual distrust, base rates from comparable historical conflicts, and the technical requirements for a comprehensive, 30-day bilateral ceasefire (across all territories, with no breakdowns) are recurrently cited as severe barriers. Most experts acknowledge that last-minute breakthroughs or dramatic concessions are theoretically possible\u2014particularly under extreme international pressure or a shock event\u2014but see little concrete evidence in current news or negotiations of substantive mutual softness on the core issues. Timing is an additional constraint, as an agreement would need to be reached almost immediately to meet the minimum duration criterion. While the diplomatic tempo is unprecedented and international actors (US, EU, possibly Turkey) have increased urgency, this is viewed as insufficient to overcome the entrenched deadlock and implementation difficulties. All experts describe 'No' scenarios involving ongoing talks, persistent front-line fighting, and at most limited local or short-term pauses, with no comprehensive bilateral ceasefire. 'Yes' scenarios are unanimously described as highly unlikely contingencies requiring either elite capitulation under duress, a sudden alignment of interests, or unanticipated political shocks. In sum: the consensus among the experts is that, despite heavy mediation and growing war fatigue, the structural, political, and military impediments are too great; a bilateral 30-day ceasefire resolving the conflict before 2026 remains extremely improbable.",
