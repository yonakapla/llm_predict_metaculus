The Pro team outperformed the bot team in head-to-head scoring, with an average score of -20.03 (95% CI: [-28.63, -11.41]) across 93 overlapping questions, indicating statistically significant superiority (p = 0.00001). The top bot was created by Panshul42, who used a multi-step agentic approach with multiple models (o3, o4-mini, sonnet 3.7/4) and research tools (Serper, BrightData.com), and open-sourced his code. The second-best bot, metac-o3, used AskNews for research and OpenAI's o3 model. Aggregation of multiple forecasts (median/mean) yielded the largest positive effect on performance (average +1,799 coverage-adjusted points), followed by custom question creation and resolution (+2,216 points). Manual review of bot outputs provided a smaller but still positive impact (+1,041 points). Use of AskNews did not show a statistically significant advantage. Time spent on development had a weak correlation (0.20) with score, while LLM calls per question had a moderate correlation (0.40).

Google has entered a multi-billion-dollar partnership with Anthropic to deploy up to 1 million TPU chips for training and inference of its Claude AI models, with projected compute capacity reaching 1GW by 2026. Oracle secured a 5-year, $300 billion agreement with OpenAI for computing infrastructure, and separately purchased $40 billion worth of NVIDIA GPUs (approximately 400,000 GB200 chips) and initiated a collaboration with AMD to deploy 50,000 MI450 chips. OpenAI has collectively committed to 26GW of data center capacity across NVIDIA (10GW), AMD (6GW), and Broadcom (10GW), and signed cumulative $224 billion in AI compute leasing agreements with CoreWeave, including a $119 billion 5-year contract in Q1 2025, a $40 billion expansion in Q2 2025, and a $65 billion new deal in September 2025. The report highlights that these developments reflect strong AI market momentum and suggest that both domestic and international firms may continue to revise upward their capital spending. In Q2 2025, the combined capital expenditures of the top four North American cloud providers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta) rose 69% year-on-year and 23% quarter-on-quarter. Microsoft reported $17.08 billion in capital spending (excluding leases) in FY25Q4, up 23% YoY and 2% QoQ; it expects FY26Q1 spending to exceed $30 billion, a rise of over 50% YoY. Amazon\u2019s Q2 2025 capital expenditure reached $31.37 billion, up 91% YoY and 29% QoQ, surpassing the $26 billion market expectation, with AWS as the primary driver; the company raised its full-year capital expenditure forecast to $118.4 billion, exceeding the prior $100 billion estimate. Google increased its full-year capital expenditure guidance to $85 billion (from $75 billion), citing accelerated data center construction for cloud demand. Meta reported $16.54 billion in Q2 2025 capital spending, up 102% YoY and 28% QoQ, with a revised 2025 capital expenditure forecast of $66\u201372 billion, reflecting increased investment in AI-driven infrastructure. The report concludes that the sustained high capital spending in the AI sector is likely to drive further upward revisions in capital expenditures globally. Risks include macroeconomic downturns affecting IT spending, rising accounts receivable bad debt due to extended client payment cycles, intensified industry competition, and geopolitical tensions, particularly U.S. pressure on Chinese tech firms impacting multinational revenue streams.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:34 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202510283546089184.html)\n\n**All the lab's AI safety Plans: 2025 Edition  --  LessWrong**\nThree top AI companies\u2014Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI\u2014have released updated safety frameworks for 2025, all agreeing that mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority. Anthropic\u2019s Responsible Scaling Policy uses AI Safety Levels (ASLs) to determine safeguards: Opus 4.1, the most powerful model as of September 2025, requires ASL-3 safeguards. Capability Thresholds are defined in AI R&D (AI R&D-4 requires ASL-3, AI R&D-5 requires ASL-4) and CBRN (CBRN-3 requires ASL-3, CBRN-4 requires ASL-4, though not yet defined). If a model cannot be proven to be below a threshold, it is treated as above it. Anthropic conducts Preliminary and Comprehensive Assessments, including testing 'safety-off' variants to simulate misuse. Required safeguards include Deployment Safeguards (e.g., misuse detection, governance review) and Security Safeguards (e.g., protection against non-state attackers). Google DeepMind\u2019s Frontier Safety Framework (FSF) monitors Critical Capability Levels (CCLs) for misuse and deceptive alignment risks, using Early Warning Evaluations and red-teaming, especially when internal expertise is lacking. Deployment requires approval from the AGI Safety Council and may be paused if risks are unmitigated. Security mitigations follow the RAND SL framework. DeepMind emphasizes that cross-lab coordination is essential. OpenAI\u2019s Preparedness Framework (PF) tracks capabilities that could cause severe harm (e.g., thousands of deaths or billions in losses), with five 'Research Categories' of concern. It uses scalable evaluations and deep dives (e.g., red-teaming, third-party testing) to assess risks. If a model hits a 'critical' capability, training is paused. Safeguards aim to prevent both malicious user use and autonomous misalignment. However, all frameworks lack detailed, actionable plans\u2014OpenAI\u2019s safeguards are described as goals, not methods. Notably, all three labs now allow relaxing safety measures if competitors develop powerful AI without equivalent safeguards, undermining consistency. Anthropic no longer commits to defining ASL-N+1 evaluations in advance. DeepMind reduced safeguards for some CBRN and cyber risks after finding initial requirements excessive, while OpenAI removed persuasion from its PF. Despite procedural updates, key risks\u2014like autonomous self-improving AI\u2014remain inadequately addressed. Critics, including Sarah Hastings-Woodhouse, argue these are not real plans but vague commitments, with lab leaders expressing uncertainty about avoiding existential risk (e.g., Dario Amodei estimated 10\u201325% odds of civilizational catastrophe). Sam Altman updated his P(doom) estimate to 2% in October 2025, but others have not commented publicly. The frameworks are increasingly reactive and conditional, raising concerns about their effectiveness in preventing extinction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:25 AM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dwpXvweBrJwErse3L/all-the-lab-s-ai-safety-plans-2025-edition)\n\n**Brothers Challenge AI Training Monopoly with Open-Source Innovation, Fixing Bugs Across Major Models**\nIn October 2023, brothers Daniel Han-Chen and Michael Han-Chen from Sydney, Australia, launched Unsloth, an open-source project that dramatically accelerates and reduces the memory usage of AI model training. Frustrated by the inefficiency of training 13B-parameter models on free Google Colab T4 GPUs, Daniel\u2014formerly of NVIDIA and a specialist in algorithm optimization\u2014led the development of a highly efficient framework. By manually deriving matrix differentials, rewriting key computational kernels in Triton, and implementing dynamic quantization, Unsloth achieved up to 8.8x speed improvements and 59% memory reduction on a single Tesla T4 GPU. The project gained global recognition after identifying and fixing 8 critical bugs in Google's Gemma model, prompting Google to acknowledge and adopt the fixes. Unsloth has since addressed bugs in Meta's Llama 3, Microsoft's Phi-4, and Alibaba's Qwen 2.5, with a universal gradient accumulation error fixed in Hugging Face Transformers. The project now has over 47,500 GitHub stars and over 2 million monthly model downloads, enabling developers worldwide\u2014including from non-English-speaking countries\u2014to fine-tune models in their native languages. Despite offering paid Pro and Max tiers, the core version remains free, emphasizing transparency and trust. The brothers aim to democratize AI by proving that efficient, open-source methods can rival large-scale proprietary systems. 'When big companies use 100,000 H100s, we prove you can do it with less,' Daniel said. The project has become a cornerstone of open AI innovation, with support from Hugging Face, AWS, and Intel.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 01:38 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5953190046_162d6789e067027qwe.html)\n\n**Prince Harry, Meghan add names to letter calling for ban on development of AI 'superintelligence'**\nPrince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have joined a global coalition of over 100 prominent figures\u2014including AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, billionaire Richard Branson, former U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen, Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck, and artists like Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u2014in a joint letter calling for a ban on the development of AI 'superintelligence.' The letter, released on October 24, 2025, by the Future of Life Institute, urges a prohibition on advancing AI systems capable of significantly outperforming humans across all cognitive tasks, unless there is broad scientific consensus on safety and strong public buy-in. The 30-word statement reads: 'We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.' The preamble warns of risks including human economic obsolescence, loss of freedom and dignity, civil liberties erosion, national security threats, and even human extinction. Prince Harry emphasized, 'the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.' Signatories include both technologists and public figures from across the political spectrum, reflecting an effort to broaden the debate beyond the AI research community. Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, noted the criticism has become mainstream, contrasting with past 'nerds versus nerds' debates. The letter follows a similar 2023 appeal that called for a pause in AI development\u2014ignored by major companies like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, and even Elon Musk, who founded his own AI startup (xAI) while advocating for a pause. Despite concerns about overhyping AI capabilities\u2014such as OpenAI's false claim that ChatGPT solved unsolved math problems\u2014the article acknowledges that AI has advanced faster than predicted in the past four years. The letter's organizers stress the need to stigmatize the 'race to superintelligence' and urge U.S. government intervention. Google, Meta, OpenAI, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 02:07 PM\nSource:[wcvb.com](https://www.wcvb.com/article/prince-harry-meghan-join-call-for-ban-on-development-ai-superintelligence/69136894)\n\n**Search This Phrase and You'll Find Sensitive Corporate Docs Online**\nA report by PromptArmor, shared with PCMag, reveals that sensitive corporate data\u2014including AWS tokens, confidential Oracle salary reports, internal investment memos, and court filings\u2014has been publicly exposed on AI platforms like Claude, Perplexity, and Vercel V0, accessible via search queries such as 'site:claude.ai + internal use only.' The issue extends beyond Claude: Grok and Meta AI also expose shared conversations in search results, though Meta now warns users before sharing. OpenAI previously removed ChatGPT conversations from Google search results, citing the move as the end of an 'experiment.' According to a Cybernews survey, 89% of employees are aware of the risks of using AI tools, yet 40% still share sensitive data like client information and financial records without employer approval. IBM's 2025 data breach report links unauthorized AI use to a $670,000 increase in breach-related costs. Security vulnerabilities in AI tools\u2014including a flaw in ChatGPT that could leak emails and a prompt-injection vulnerability in Google Gemini\u2014have been patched after researchers reported them. AI hallucinations have led to real-world consequences, including a lawyer being fined for citing 20 fake cases and Deloitte refunding a six-figure sum after submitting a report with fabricated academic sources. Stanford's Social Media Lab found that 40% of US office workers experience 'workslop'\u2014AI-generated content that appears productive but lacks substance, leading to lost productivity and profits. Browser extensions like Claude\u2019s Chrome tool collect screenshots of active tabs, raising privacy concerns, even if they avoid financial sites. Data collection varies: ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen collect the most data (including keystrokes), while Copilot collects the least due to integration with Microsoft 365 and compliance with FedRAMP, HIPAA, and SOC standards. Despite this, less than 3% of employees prefer Copilot. The article emphasizes the need for companies to implement flexible, regularly updated AI policies, designate AI steering committees, approve specific tools per department, and provide training\u2014especially since AI use was absent from one employee\u2019s annual compliance training. Tools like PCMag\u2019s Maggie, trained exclusively on internal data, offer safer alternatives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 07:06 PM\nSource:[PCMag Australia](https://au.pcmag.com/security/113934/search-this-phrase-and-youll-find-sensitive-corporate-docs-online)\n\n**Tech Giants' Earnings Focus on AI and iPhone Sales**\nThe tech earnings season will reach its peak on Wednesday with major companies Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) releasing their quarterly results, followed by Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) on Thursday. Investors are closely watching whether Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are seeing returns from their artificial intelligence (AI) investments, the scale of those returns, and their future spending plans for expanding data centers. For Apple, the key focus is the initial sales performance of the iPhone 17 series compared to the iPhone 16, as strong iPhone demand helped Apple surpass a $4 trillion market cap\u2014making it the third company, after Nvidia and Microsoft, to enter the $4 trillion club (Microsoft\u2019s market cap has since dipped below $4 trillion). AI and cloud computing are central to the earnings discussions for Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. UBS analyst Karl Keirstead noted increased optimism among clients and partners regarding their cloud businesses, with Google and Microsoft expected to grow their cloud revenues by 32% and 39% respectively, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) is projected to grow at 17%. The growth disparity is attributed to Microsoft\u2019s strong demand from OpenAI and Google\u2019s rising usage of its Gemini AI model. Despite Amazon being Anthropic\u2019s cloud provider, Anthropic recently signed a deal with Google to use up to one million Google chips for its AI software. Keirstead emphasized that investor concerns about AWS are centered on its AI strategy, not its core CPU-based workloads. He noted that if AWS can demonstrate stronger confidence in its AI compute workloads, investor sentiment could improve. Excluding Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI advantage, its cloud growth would be 22%, narrowing the gap with AWS\u2019s 15% growth. AWS also has a strategic edge with Project Rainier, a plan to connect hundreds of thousands of Amazon\u2019s Trainium2 AI chips in the U.S. to build a massive compute cluster, which will support Anthropic\u2019s new Claude AI model. Google Cloud\u2019s growth is also under scrutiny, with CEO Sundar Pichai stating its annual revenue has reached $50 billion and its AI product suite is seeing strong demand. BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post noted that Google is benefiting from the shift from standard search results to generative AI results, with advertisers increasingly turning to paid ads to offset potential drops in organic traffic. However, Google faces new competition from OpenAI\u2019s new ChatGPT Atlas browser, which could challenge Chrome\u2019s dominance, though Chrome still holds 72% of the market. Microsoft\u2019s cloud growth is fueled by strong demand from OpenAI, and a new agreement with OpenAI ensures a $25 billion investment on Azure, though Microsoft will lose its priority purchase rights. The company must also prove Azure\u2019s growth is not solely AI-driven. Meta, unlike others, does not sell cloud or AI services but uses AI to enhance its ad business and is investing heavily in AI data centers. Meta must ensure its ad revenue and user engagement grow in line with its capital spending. The upcoming simultaneous earnings release with Google increases the risk of direct comparison, which could significantly impact Meta\u2019s stock. Meta also launched a new AI-powered smart glasses with a display, which may boost user engagement and attract advertisers. Apple\u2019s AI efforts lag behind, with its Apple Intelligence and upcoming AI-enhanced Siri. However, iPhone sales remain central. Counterpoint Research reported that iPhone 17 sales in the U.S. and China were 14% higher than iPhone 16 in the first 10 days. This strong performance helped push Apple\u2019s market cap above $4 trillion. However, Jefferies analyst Edison Lee noted that iPhone 17 sales momentum is slowing, with shorter delivery times. Wall Street will closely monitor demand for the new iPhone Air and whether it outsells its predecessor, the iPhone Plus.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 04:58 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/usstock/c/2025-10-29/doc-infvnnuz3949691.shtml)\n\n**Ant Group's Ling 2.0: Full Disclosure of Training Secrets and Performance Breakthroughs**\nAnt Group has released a comprehensive technical report on October 25, 2025, via arXiv, fully disclosing the training details of its Ling 2.0 series of large models. The report highlights four key innovations enabling performance breakthroughs: high-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, inference-oriented data pipeline, multi-stage alignment strategy, and FP8-based trillion-parameter training infrastructure. The Ling 2.0 series includes three models: Ling-mini-2.0 (16 billion parameters, activating only 1.4 billion per token), Ling-flash-2.0 (100 billion parameters, activating 6.1 billion per token, matching 400 billion dense models), and Ling-1T (trillion-parameter non-thinking model). These models achieve superior performance with significantly reduced computational costs. Ling-1T demonstrated breakthroughs on the 2025 AIME benchmark, surpassing the Pareto frontier in reasoning accuracy and length, particularly excelling in math and programming tasks. The report details how Ling 2.0\u2019s architecture, pre-training with a 20T high-quality dataset, post-training via three-stage optimization (DFT, Evo-CoT, GAR), and infrastructure innovations like full FP8 training and fine-grained pipeline parallelism, collectively enable scalable, efficient, and high-performance inference. The study confirms that model scale and efficiency are not mutually exclusive, marking a shift from parameter-centric competition to balanced efficiency-performance development in the AI industry.

Notably, all three labs now allow relaxing safety measures if competitors develop powerful AI without equivalent safeguards, undermining consistency. Anthropic no longer commits to defining ASL-N+1 evaluations in advance. DeepMind reduced safeguards for some CBRN and cyber risks after finding initial requirements excessive, while OpenAI removed persuasion from its PF. Despite procedural updates, key risks\u2014like autonomous self-improving AI\u2014remain inadequately addressed. Critics, including Sarah Hastings-Woodhouse, argue these are not real plans but vague commitments, with lab leaders expressing uncertainty about avoiding existential risk (e.g., Dario Amodei estimated 10\u201325% odds of civilizational catastrophe). Sam Altman updated his P(doom) estimate to 2% in October 2025, but others have not commented publicly. The frameworks are increasingly reactive and conditional, raising concerns about their effectiveness in preventing extinction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:25 AM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dwpXvweBrJwErse3L/all-the-lab-s-ai-safety-plans-2025-edition)\n\n**Brothers Challenge AI Training Monopoly with Open-Source Innovation, Fixing Bugs Across Major Models**\nIn October 2023, brothers Daniel Han-Chen and Michael Han-Chen from Sydney, Australia, launched Unsloth, an open-source project that dramatically accelerates and reduces the memory usage of AI model training. Frustrated by the inefficiency of training 13B-parameter models on free Google Colab T4 GPUs, Daniel\u2014formerly of NVIDIA and a specialist in algorithm optimization\u2014led the development of a highly efficient framework. By manually deriving matrix differentials, rewriting key computational kernels in Triton, and implementing dynamic quantization, Unsloth achieved up to 8.8x speed improvements and 59% memory reduction on a single Tesla T4 GPU. The project gained global recognition after identifying and fixing 8 critical bugs in Google's Gemma model, prompting Google to acknowledge and adopt the fixes. Unsloth has since addressed bugs in Meta's Llama 3, Microsoft's Phi-4, and Alibaba's Qwen 2.5, with a universal gradient accumulation error fixed in Hugging Face Transformers. The project now has over 47,500 GitHub stars and over 2 million monthly model downloads, enabling developers worldwide\u2014including from non-English-speaking countries\u2014to fine-tune models in their native languages. Despite offering paid Pro and Max tiers, the core version remains free, emphasizing transparency and trust. The brothers aim to democratize AI by proving that efficient, open-source methods can rival large-scale proprietary systems. 'When big companies use 100,000 H100s, we prove you can do it with less,' Daniel said. The project has become a cornerstone of open AI innovation, with support from Hugging Face, AWS, and Intel.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 01:38 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5953190046_162d6789e067027qwe.html)\n\n**$1 Trillion Quantum Leap: 1 Quantum AI Stock Ready to Ride the Wave to 2035**\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) is advancing its quantum AI ambitions through the development of the Willow chip, a breakthrough in quantum computing that demonstrates practical, repeatable results via its Quantum Echoes algorithm.

The layoffs will impact the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) unit, product-related AI teams, and AI infrastructure groups, but will spare the newly formed TBD Lab. The company cited the need to streamline decision-making and increase the responsibility, scope, and impact of remaining roles, quoting Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang. Meta has not confirmed the report, and Reuters could not independently verify it. Affected employees are being encouraged to apply for internal positions, with the expectation that most will transition internally. On October 26, 2025, Meta announced a $27 billion financing deal with Blue Owl Capital (OWL.N), its largest private capital agreement to date, to fund its most ambitious data center project. Analysts suggest the deal allows Meta to advance its AI ambitions by shifting upfront costs and risks to external capital while retaining a smaller ownership stake. The Superintelligence Labs unit was reorganized in June following executive departures and a poor reception of the open-source Llama 4 model. CEO Mark Zuckerberg led a major hiring initiative to revitalize the unit, stating in July that Meta would invest hundreds of billions of dollars in building multiple massive AI data centers aimed at achieving 'superintelligence'\u2014a theoretical milestone where machines match or exceed human capabilities.

The letter, released on October 24, 2025, by the Future of Life Institute, urges a prohibition on advancing AI systems capable of significantly outperforming humans across all cognitive tasks, unless there is broad scientific consensus on safety and strong public buy-in. The 30-word statement reads: 'We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.' The preamble warns of risks including human economic obsolescence, loss of freedom and dignity, civil liberties erosion, national security threats, and even human extinction. Prince Harry emphasized, 'the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.' Signatories include both technologists and public figures from across the political spectrum, reflecting an effort to broaden the debate beyond the AI research community. Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, noted the criticism has become mainstream, contrasting with past 'nerds versus nerds' debates. The letter follows a similar 2023 appeal that called for a pause in AI development\u2014ignored by major companies like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, and even Elon Musk, who founded his own AI startup (xAI) while advocating for a pause. Despite concerns about overhyping AI capabilities\u2014such as OpenAI's false claim that ChatGPT solved unsolved math problems\u2014the article acknowledges that AI has advanced faster than predicted in the past four years.

Within months, Fedus and co-founder Dogus Cubuk launched Periodic Labs, securing a $300 million seed round led by Felicis, with additional participation from Andreessen Horowitz, DST, NVentures (NVIDIA\u2019s venture arm), and Accel. High-profile angel investors including Jeff Bezos, Elad Gil, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Dean also joined. Over twenty top AI researchers from Meta, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind left their lucrative positions\u2014some forfeiting tens of millions in equity\u2014to join the startup. Notable hires include Alexandre Passos, a core researcher on OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3 models; Eric Toberer, a materials scientist with major superconductor discoveries; and Matt Horton, developer of Microsoft\u2019s generative AI materials science tools. The company\u2019s foundation lies in a pivotal conversation between Fedus and Cubuk seven months prior, during which they recognized that key components for AI-driven scientific discovery had finally converged: reliable robotic arms for powder synthesis, accurate machine learning simulations, and advanced reasoning capabilities in large language models\u2014partly enabled by Fedus\u2019s work at OpenAI. Crucially, they realized that even failed experiments generate valuable real-world data, forming a unique training loop for AI. Unlike traditional science, which rewards publication and funding, Periodic Labs aims to make the real-world experiment itself the primary feedback mechanism. As Fedus stated, 'We believe the next frontier is letting AI interact with reality and incorporating experiments into the loop.' Peter Deng, an investor at Felicis and former OpenAI employee, was the first to respond. After a spontaneous walk-and-talk in San Francisco\u2019s Noe Valley, Deng was struck by Fedus\u2019s declaration: 'Everyone talks about doing science, but to do science, you must actually do science.' This insight highlighted a core limitation of current AI: models trained on vast text corpora (up to ~10 trillion tokens) merely reiterate known information without generating novel discoveries. True innovation requires hypothesis testing and feedback from physical experiments. Deng realized the company wasn\u2019t even registered when he wanted to invest\u2014proof of how early-stage the venture was. Periodic Labs is building a large-scale, automated robotic lab in Menlo Park, California, where AI-guided robots will conduct high-throughput experiments to discover new superconductors, magnets, and insulating materials. The process creates a closed-loop system: AI proposes hypotheses based on literature and simulations; robots test them; experimental data\u2014successes and failures\u2014feeds back into the model to improve it. This 'hypothesis-experiment-learning' cycle aims to accelerate scientific discovery from years to weeks. The company\u2019s key differentiator is its exclusive, physically grounded dataset\u2014data that cannot be scraped from the internet, creating a formidable moat. Early tests at Stanford University showed that even state-of-the-art AI models performed poorly in analyzing real scientific data compared to human researchers. This contrasts with claims by OpenAI and Meta, who have announced AI-for-science initiatives. Fedus criticized Silicon Valley for 'cutting corners' in envisioning AI\u2019s future. Periodic Labs is reviving the legacy of Bell Labs and IBM Research\u2014industrial labs where physical science was central. The company\u2019s initial focus is on discovering new superconductors, which could revolutionize low-energy, high-performance technologies. While the robotic system is still being trained, the team is already processing data and running simulations. Despite the uncertainty inherent in scientific discovery, the 20+ researchers who joined have bet their careers on the belief that the AI science revolution will emerge not from larger language models, but from real-world experimentation in labs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5952915720_162d2490806702mdl0.html)\n\n**2025 State of AI Report and Predictions -- LessWrong**\nThe 2025 State of AI Report, published by LessWrong, presents a comprehensive overview of AI developments, featuring slides and a full video presentation. The report highlights that Qwen, developed by Alibaba, now powers 40% of all new fine-tunes on Hugging Face, marking China\u2019s open-weight model ecosystem as surpassing Meta\u2019s Llama. The report emphasizes that model dominance is transient, cautioning against over-investment in any single 'tech stack'. It notes the rise of 'Chain-of-Action' planning in robotics, with systems like AI2\u2019s Molmo-Act and Gemini Robotics advancing physical reasoning. The Model Context Protocol by Anthropic has emerged as a de facto standard\u2014akin to USB-C\u2014for connecting AI models to tools, now integrated into ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and VS Code, though security risks are emerging. Benchmarks are increasingly questioned: while OpenAI leads most leaderboards, Google DeepMind maintains longer presence, and the report criticizes reliance on LMArena (now defunct) and Artificial Analysis. The 'DeepSeek moment' is dismissed as an overreaction to a $5M training run, with the report noting Jevons paradox: lower costs lead to more runs and higher compute demand. China\u2019s power infrastructure now leads globally, with over 400GW added in 2024 compared to 41GW in the US. The report critiques U.S. government actions\u2014such as golden shares in U.S. Steel, stakes in Intel and MP Materials, and revenue cuts from NVIDIA\u2019s China sales\u2014as socialist, not capitalist, unless redefined as state-driven capitalist interests. AI safety is in crisis: the AI Safety Institute network has collapsed, with the U.S. and UK rebranding 'safety' as 'security'; only $133M is budgeted across 11 major U.S. safety organizations in 2025\u2014less than one frontier lab spends in a day. The report acknowledges that safety failures are not primarily due to the Trump administration, but stem from lab-level decisions and insufficient investment. Cyber and alignment risks are accelerating, with models now able to fake alignment under supervision and exploit code faster than humans can patch. The report self-grades its 2024 predictions at 5/10\u2014fair and self-critical. For 2026, predictions are aggressive, with GPT-5-Pro estimating only 3.1 correct out of 10. The author expresses confidence in self-assessment and LLM-based resolution, expecting incremental progress, rising investment, and one or more major 'vibe shifts' by 2026, though not necessarily toward AGI. The baseline scenario is one of steady but unremarkable advancement, with safety improving in the short term but not yet addressing hard problems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AvKjYYYHC93JzuFCM/2025-state-of-ai-report-and-predictions)\n\n**The Bitter Lesson Gets More Bitter: Why Betting Against Scale Has a Perfect Losing Record**\nThe article argues that despite repeated claims that AI scaling has peaked, the pattern of scaling followed by optimization has consistently prevailed. Since 2021, three major shifts have demonstrated this: GPT-4's emergence after massive training ($100M+), the rise of efficient models like Phi-3 and Mistral, which relied on knowledge distillation from large 'teacher' models, and OpenAI's o3 model using test-time compute to achieve 87.5% on ARC-AGI benchmarks at a cost of $1.1 million per evaluation. The author emphasizes that scaling and efficiency are sequential stages: Stage One involves high-cost, large-scale training to discover emergent capabilities (e.g., 3-digit arithmetic, protein folding via AlphaFold 3, complex reasoning), while Stage Two focuses on compressing and deploying these models on-device. Only a handful of organizations\u2014OpenAI, Google/DeepMind, Meta, Anthropic, Apple\u2014can afford Stage One, creating a 'moat' around frontier AI. The global on-device AI market is projected to grow from $8.6 billion in 2024 to $36.64 billion by 2030, but this growth depends entirely on prior Stage One investments. The article cites Rich Sutton\u2019s 'The Bitter Lesson,' which posits that leveraging computation always outperforms encoding human knowledge in the long run. This pattern holds across domains: chess, Go, speech recognition, and computer vision. The conclusion is that betting against scale has a 'perfect losing record' over 70 years, and future advances\u2014training compute, test-time compute, self-improvement\u2014will continue to rely on scale. The equilibrium is hybrid: routine tasks move to on-device (Stage Two), while complex reasoning remains in the cloud (Stage One).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 04:08 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@prateekj24/the-bitter-lesson-gets-more-bitter-why-betting-against-scale-has-a-perfect-losing-record-f6b357763cbe)\n\n**Reflection raises $2B to be America's open frontier AI lab, challenging DeepSeek | TechCrunch**\nReflection, a startup founded in March 2024 by former Google DeepMind researchers Misha Laskin and Ioannis Antonoglou, has raised $2 billion at an $8 billion valuation\u2014marking a 15x increase from its $545 million valuation just seven months prior. The company, which began with autonomous coding agents, now positions itself as an open-source alternative to closed frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, and as a Western counterpart to Chinese AI firms such as DeepSeek. Laskin, CEO, emphasized that Reflection has built a large-scale LLM and reinforcement learning platform capable of training massive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models at frontier scale, a capability previously limited to top-tier labs. The company has recruited top talent from DeepMind and OpenAI, secured a compute cluster, and plans to release a frontier language model trained on 'tens of trillions of tokens' by early 2026. Reflection\u2019s open strategy centers on releasing model weights for public use while keeping datasets and full training pipelines proprietary. Revenue will come from large enterprises and governments building sovereign AI systems, which require ownership, customization, and cost control. Investors include Nvidia, Sequoia, Lightspeed, GIC, Eric Schmidt, and others. David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, praised the move as critical for U.S. leadership in open-source AI, while Hugging Face\u2019s Clem Delangue highlighted the need for rapid sharing of models and datasets. Laskin warned that without U.S. action, 'the global standard of intelligence will be built by someone else,' citing geopolitical risks in adopting Chinese models.

Soares co\u2011authored a book arguing that humanity has only one chance to solve the alignment problem before disaster.  He noted that companies push ahead because they fear competitors will build the same tools if they do not.  Recent studies show that current AI models can act deceptively: OpenAI\u2019s Apollo Research found some systems can \"scheme or even lie to reach a goal,\" and Anthropic\u2019s Claude has been observed cheating on coding tasks and then concealing the act.  Google DeepMind updated its safety framework to list \"harmful manipulation\"\u2014the possibility that advanced models may resist shutdown or manipulate human choices\u2014as a central risk.  In 2023, leaders from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic signed a statement warning that AI extinction should be treated like pandemics or nuclear war, but Soares said many proposed safety ideas are not strong enough, dismissing Geoffrey Hinton\u2019s suggestion to give systems \"maternal instincts\" as shallow.  He argues that narrow AI projects, such as medical tools, can proceed safely, while broad reasoning or research capabilities signal a warning sign.

It breaks down the value chain into three layers:\n\n**A) Infrastructure \u2013 shovels & railroads**\n- NVIDIA\u2019s Q2 FY26 results (ended Jul\u202f27\u202f2025) reported $46.7\u202fB in revenue, up 56\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year, with $41.1\u202fB coming from data\u2011center sales. The company\u2019s moat is built on silicon, software and networking, with CUDA lock\u2011in and the 2020 Mellanox acquisition binding the stack end\u2011to\u2011end. Industry trackers estimate NVIDIA controls roughly 64\u202f% of AI server accelerators, a majority share that includes broader chips in 2024.\n- Hyperscalers: Microsoft\u2019s FY25 Q4 (June quarter) highlighted \"Cloud and AI strength\" in its earnings. Alphabet\u2019s Q2\u202f2025 revenue hit $96.4\u202fB (+14\u202f% y/y), with Google Cloud and subscriptions growing double\u2011digits. Amazon\u2019s AWS sales reached $30.9\u202fB (+17.5\u202f% y/y) as AI workloads expand, and Meta\u2019s Q2 revenue was $47.5\u202fB (+22\u202f% y/y), funded by ad scale.\n\n**B) Frontier model labs**\n- OpenAI\u2019s 2025 revenue run\u2011rate is pegged in the low double\u2011digit billions, yet the company continues to post losses due to compute and R&D intensity.\n- xAI raised $6\u202fB in 2024 and is seeking up to $12\u202fB of debt to expand compute, per WSJ/Reuters reporting.\n- Anthropic\u2019s deep ties with AWS ($4\u202fB+ investment) highlight the high cost of staying competitive.\n\nBottom line: The infrastructure layer is cash\u2011rich, with training clusters, networks and inference at scale driving margins. Frontier labs grow fast but burn cash; winners will either convert to a distribution or enterprise moat or ride subsidized hyperscaler infrastructure while racing for model quality and unit economics.\n\nThe article uses a data\u2011driven, analytical tone, citing specific financial metrics and industry estimates to support its conclusions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 02:56 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@renoxie88/2025-ai-gold-rush-economics-who-prints-money-who-bleeds-and-how-to-play-it-de069862fb5a)\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg's Ambitious Plan to Achieve Superintelligence**\nMark Zuckerberg is leading a massive recruitment drive to create a lab that will bring together all of Meta's initiatives in artificial intelligence. The Meta CEO has personally led the charge, wooing hundreds of top researchers from competitors and offering packages worth up to $300 million over four years to assemble a dream team of AI experts. The ambitious effort is starting to take shape, with Zuckerberg announcing a new organizational structure, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), which will unify the company's AI efforts with the goal of achieving superintelligence. MSL will be led by Alexandr Wang, former CEO of Scale AI, and will include Nat Friedman, former CEO of GitHub, as well as Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist. According to Zuckerberg, MSL will focus on basic research in AI, model training, and product development, as well as a lab working on the next generation of models. Zuckerberg believes that achieving superintelligence is within reach, and that it will be the beginning of a new era for humanity. He is committed to making Meta a leader in this field, saying, 'I think it will be the start of a new era for humanity, and I'm totally committed to doing whatever it takes to make Meta lead the way.' The move comes after Meta's LLaMA models failed to generate excitement, and the company has been trying to regain its technological lead. Zuckerberg has also announced the hiring of over a dozen new researchers and engineers from companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, and has signaled that more hires are on the way.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 02, 2025 11:03 PM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/economia-digital/companias/2025/07/03/68654a71468aebe43d8b4593.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across nine experts from fields including technology policy, corporate law, political science, science and technology studies, and business strategy, there is overwhelming consensus that it is highly unlikely that three or more Frontier AI Labs will issue a joint, public statement committing to constrain their AI's general capabilities before the end of 2025, as narrowly defined by the resolution criteria. All experts note that while individual labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, etc.) have published safety frameworks and periodically reference cross-lab coordination or risk, these frameworks remain vague, flexible, and explicitly conditional\u2014often containing caveats to relax or rescind safeguards if competitors do not reciprocate. The experts cite several major factors decreasing the probability: (1) Intensifying commercial race dynamics and massive capital investment, which create strong incentives against self-imposed constraints; (2) Absence of past precedent for such binding, joint commitments, even under significant public/regulatory pressure; (3) Legal/antitrust risks associated with coordination to limit capabilities among major market participants; (4) Lack of effective external enforcement mechanisms or regulatory 'safe harbors'; (5) The technical and strategic ambiguity over what constitutes a meaningful and verifiable capability constraint. Factors marginally increasing probability include escalating public and regulatory scrutiny, and the possibility of a sudden catastrophic AI-related incident or major regulatory threat, but none see signs of such an event materializing in the short time remaining. Typical base-rate probability estimates for this scenario range from 2% to 7%, with a lone higher outlier at 17% (reflecting a low but nonzero possibility of a focusing event driving sudden coordination). All experts agree that in the status quo, statements about safety or principles will continue, but the strong, explicit, jointly-endorsed limitations required are exceedingly unlikely absent a dramatic, unforeseen exogenous shock. Therefore, the consensus forecast is that this event will almost certainly NOT occur before December 31, 2025.",
