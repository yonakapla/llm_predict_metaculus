The most robust critique across discussion was of overly cautious probability assignments not justified by the extreme historical conservatism GiveWell has shown for top charity shifts, especially with only two months left before resolution.

The original question opened on 2020-08-04 23:00:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4919). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAccording to GiveWell's [Cost-Effectiveness Analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLmPuddUmKsy3v55AfG_e1Quk-ngDdNzW-FDx0T-Y94) (CEA), mass deworming ranks among the very best global health interventions. The evidence for deworming comes primarily from a [single study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21428), which showed large economic effects which were present a full decade after treatment. However, other studies have shown [little](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(16)30242-X/fulltext) to [no effect](https://www.cochrane.org/CD000371/INFECTN_deworming-school-children-low-and-middle-income-countries) of mass deworming on weight, cognitive ability, school attendance or other health outcomes, and the weight placed on the initial paper has proved [controversial](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9031909/worm-wars-explained).\n\nIn GiveWell's CEA, deworming benefits are modeled as being entirely due to long-term economic effects like those seen in the study mentioned above. Despite being heavily discounted due to concerns about replicability, in expectation these economic effects are expected to dominate the short term health effects of the interventions.\n\nGivewell's position is explained, in detail, in the following two blog posts:\n\n- [Why I mostly believe in Worms](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/06/why-i-mostly-believe-in-worms/)\n\n- [How thin the reed](https://blog.givewell.org/2017/01/04/how-thin-the-reed-generalizing-from-worms-at-work/)\n\nSome more information is available in [this](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming) evidence overview, written by GiveWell, which cites several papers, and [this](https://www.evidenceaction.org/a-summary-of-the-deworming-evidence-base/) evidence overview, which was written by Evidence Action. While Evidence Action does currently run a deworming programme, they have proved [capable](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/7/18654620/evidence-action-no-lean-season-givewell) of changing their minds on programmes when the evidence changes.\n\nCurrently, GiveWell lists seven [top charities](), of which four are deworming programmes.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":4919,\"question_id\":4919}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "**At the end of 2025, will any of GiveWell's top charities perform mass deworming as their primary intervention?**\n\n- Resolution will be according to the GiveWell [website](https://www.givewell.org/) on 2026/01/01.\n\n- If GiveWell no longer maintains a list of \"top charities\", but allows donors to donate funds which will be re-granted at GiveWell's discretion, this question resolves positively if at least 10% of these regrants go to deworming charities in the year 2025.\n\n- \"Mass deworming\" is taken to mean treating all or almost all of the individuals in a group for parasitic worms, without testing to see whether they have them. This is common practice due to the low cost and excellent safety profile of deworming medication, as well as the relative expense of testing.\n\n- If a charity has multiple programmes, but GiveWell restricts its donations to a particular programme, that programme is considered to be the \"primary intervention\" for the purposes of resolution. Otherwise, whichever intervention the organisation spends most on is considered the \"primary intervention\".\n\n- If deworming medication is administered in addition to something else, for example a vaccine or vitamin supplement, at the same time, then whether \"deworming\" is the primary intervention will be determined by whether the majority of the value of the programme comes from deworming, according to GiveWell's CEA.\n\n- If GiveWell ceases to exist in a similar form, such that neither of the conditions for positive resolution above make sense, this question resolves ambiguously.\n\n- Some of the text in this question has been adapted from [this](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FAA22RbfgC68fRnRs/if-you-mostly-believe-in-worms-what-should-you-think-about) EA forum post, by the same author.",

Six of the seven studies found the interventions to be cost-effective, with four showing they were 'dominant'\u2014improving health outcomes (measured in quality-adjusted life years) while reducing healthcare costs. However, significant uncertainty exists in the joint distribution of incremental costs and health outcomes, which may hinder widespread adoption by decision-makers. The review highlights methodological limitations, including underreporting of health economic analysis plans, distributional effects, and patient engagement impacts due to recent reporting standards. No study conducted subgroup analyses to assess how population heterogeneity influenced cost-effectiveness. Most studies used trial-based designs, with uncertainty possibly due to non-inferiority/feasibility trial designs, underpowered superiority trials, or disparities in digital literacy and adherence. Decision-analytic models were underused (only two studies), despite their ability to extrapolate outcomes over lifetime horizons and support early-stage product development. Costing methods varied widely\u2014top-down costing yielded substantially lower estimates than bottom-up micro-costing\u2014suggesting potential underestimation of system costs if key resources are omitted. The review also notes that external dashboards, while easier to set up, impose workflow burdens on healthcare staff, and full integration with electronic health records requires significant infrastructure investment. Future research should prioritize decision-analytic modeling, explore non-randomized quasi-experimental designs, and investigate optimal monitoring frequencies. Additionally, broader perspectives beyond healthcare systems\u2014such as patient time costs and travel savings\u2014should be incorporated. The findings support the potential of mobile-based remote monitoring but caution that current evidence is insufficient to justify broad adoption due to persistent uncertainty. Developers and analysts are urged to improve transparency in upfront cost reporting and deepen exploration of uncertainty drivers to strengthen value propositions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 04:36 PM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01898-3)\n\n**Cochrane Review Supports Immediate Skin-to-Skin Contact as Evidence-Based Standard for Neonatal Care**\nA newly updated Cochrane Review, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on October 24, 2025, concludes that immediate skin-to-skin contact between mothers and newborns should be considered the global standard of care. The analysis, based on 69 trials involving over 7,000 mother-infant pairs, found that placing babies on their mother's bare chest within the first hour of birth significantly improves breastfeeding rates, body temperature regulation, blood sugar levels, and other critical health outcomes. The updated review includes 26 new studies added to the 2016 version, which already informed 20 international health guidelines, including those from the World Health Organization (WHO). In high- and middle-income countries, babies receiving immediate skin-to-skin contact were 20% more likely to be exclusively breastfed at one month (75% vs. 55%) compared to those separated from their mothers after birth. Karin Cadwell, senior author and Executive Director of the Healthy Children Project's Center for Breastfeeding, stated that withholding skin-to-skin contact is now considered unethical due to the overwhelming evidence of its benefits for newborn health and survival. The authors recommend future research focus on improving implementation, particularly in low-income settings where the practice could save lives, especially among low birth weight infants.

Loneliness is linked to depression, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and early mortality. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, social disconnection is as harmful to health as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. A meta-analysis of 280 studies involving over 30,000 participants found that all five major intervention types\u2014social support, social network creation, social and emotional skills training, psychological interventions (like cognitive behavioral therapy), and psychoeducation\u2014reduced loneliness, with psychological interventions showing the strongest effects. In-person programs were more effective than digital-only ones, and benefits lasted up to six months across children, adolescents, adults, and older adults. Mathias Lasgaard, PhD, lead author from the Central Denmark Region and University of Southern Denmark, explained that cognitive behavioral therapy helps individuals reframe negative social thoughts, reducing avoidance and improving relationships. The study, the most comprehensive in over a decade, highlights the need for scalable, evidence-based solutions. However, the certainty of the evidence was rated as 'low to very low' due to methodological flaws in many studies, including small sample sizes, high dropout rates, and inadequate recruitment of lonely individuals. Researchers recommend more rigorous, population-specific evaluations. Despite limitations, the consistent results across hundreds of studies strongly suggest that loneliness can be reduced through targeted interventions, guiding policymakers and practitioners while underscoring the need for future refinement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[News-Medical.net](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251023/Loneliness-interventions-can-be-effective-but-do-not-yet-offer-a-complete-solution.aspx)\n\n**Estimating the effect on obesity of delaying tax-based interventions in Mexico: A modeling study**\nA modeling study published on October 23, 2025, by PLOS examined the human costs of delaying the implementation of a policy to double the sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) and non-essential dietary fat (NEDF) taxes in Mexico. The study found that while all intervention scenarios\u2014implemented in 2025, 2030, or 2035\u2014resulted in similar obesity prevalence by 2040 (approximately 41.6%), earlier implementation yielded significantly greater health benefits. Implementing the tax in 2025 led to 74% more years lived without obesity and 54% more deaths averted compared to 2030, and 459% more years lived without obesity and 339% more deaths averted compared to 2035. The analysis underscores that the timing of policy implementation is critical: even if long-term outcomes converge, earlier action reduces disease burden and mortality. The study highlights that Mexico, which declared an epidemiological emergency for obesity and diabetes in 2016, has delayed implementing SSB tax increases since at least 2018, with no change as of February 2025. The findings emphasize the importance of quantifying the 'cost-of-delay' in public health, particularly for population-level interventions. The model accounts for historical trends in total energy intake (TEI), showing that early interventions face steeper energy intake trends, making their immediate impact appear less effective in short-term comparisons. However, over time, earlier interventions produce far greater cumulative benefits. The study also notes limitations, including reliance on meta-analytic mortality hazard ratios, assumptions about energy intake trends, conservative price elasticity estimates, and a closed cohort model that excludes future generations. Despite these, the results consistently support the urgency of timely implementation of evidence-based fiscal policies to combat obesity and related chronic diseases. The authors advocate for incorporating temporal dimensions into future public health modeling to better assess the real-world impact of policy delays.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004769)\n\n**Expanding TB prevention could save millions of lives and yield major economic benefits, global study finds**\nA global study published in The Lancet Global Health on October 23, 2025, finds that expanding tuberculosis (TB) prevention efforts could save millions of lives and deliver substantial economic benefits. Conducted in Brazil, Georgia, Kenya, and South Africa, the modeling study evaluated the impact of screening and preventive treatment for key at-risk populations\u2014people living with HIV, household contacts of TB patients, and country-specific high-risk groups such as prisoners in Brazil, individuals receiving care for injection drug use in Georgia, and residents of high TB prevalence areas in Kenya and South Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 10.8 million people developed TB and 1.25 million died from it in 2023, including 161,000 people living with HIV, with nearly 2.6 million cases (24%) remaining undiagnosed annually. The study shows that implementing a package of interventions\u2014including TB screening via symptom checks, chest X-rays, or rapid tests, followed by preventive treatment (TPT) for those with latent infection\u2014could significantly reduce TB incidence and mortality. Dr. Jonathon Campbell, senior author and junior scientist at the McGill University Health Center\u2019s Translational Research in Respiratory Diseases Program, stated that 'we can prevent millions of people from developing and dying from tuberculosis by implementing interventions that already exist\u2014generating large societal returns on investment.' The research found that the share of national TB program budgets required to implement these interventions by 2030 ranged from 10% in Georgia to 67% in Kenya, depending on local epidemiological contexts. Prof. Campbell emphasized that 'preventive tools are already available, we know they work, and countries know who their vulnerable populations are,' and that 'using these tools efficiently with those most at risk is not only lifesaving but also makes strong economic sense.' The study\u2019s findings are expected to motivate governments and donors to scale up effective TB prevention strategies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[medicalxpress.com](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-tb-millions-yield-major-economic.html)\n\n**Atoruru PHC's Rebirth: A Tale of resilience, recovery amid global health challenges**\nThe Atoruru Primary Health Care Centre (PHC) in Sabongida Ora, Edo State, Nigeria, underwent a transformative revival following the Aig-Imoukhuede Foundation\u2019s Adopt-a-Health Facility Programme (ADHFP) intervention starting in October 2024. Prior to this, the facility faced severe challenges: from January to September 2024, ANC first visits averaged 0\u20137 monthly (with zero in March and two in September), deliveries ranged from 0\u20134 monthly, and immunisation records showed erratic data, including zero immunisations in June 2024. Malaria prevention services were non-existent, with no Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) doses administered and no Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) distributed. Stock-outs of essential medicines were frequent, outreach sessions were absent, and community trust had eroded. After the ADHFP intervention, services dramatically improved: by November 2024, 38 children were fully immunised (more than triple the previous peak), and by February 2025, monthly immunisations reached 48. ANC first visits rose to nine in November 2024 and remained at 6\u20139 through May 2025. Deliveries increased to 4\u20136 monthly, with six live births recorded in May 2025. By May 2025, the PHC administered 32 IPT doses and distributed 47 LLINs. Malaria testing and treatment capacity surged, with 48 children and 14 adults tested in March 2025 alone. Community trust was restored, with outreach sessions drawing over 80 attendees\u2014far exceeding expectations. Residents like Blessing Osawe, Ivie Osaigbovo, and Eghosa reported improved health outcomes, with mothers now seeking care proactively. The PHC now serves 16,263 people across farming communities. The transformation exemplifies how targeted investment and community partnership can restore healthcare access in underserved regions, turning a neglected facility into a beacon of hope. According to Nurse Aigbogun, 'Yesterday, a woman brought her newborn just to show me. Not because the child was sick, but because she wanted me to see what our PHC helped her create.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 12:27 AM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/features/health/atoruru-phcs-rebirth-a-tale-of-resilience-recovery-amid-global-health-challenges/)\n\n**Acupuncture Under the Microscope: What Really Happens in the Body When Needles Are Inserted**\nAcupuncture, a practice originating in ancient China, is based on the belief that health depends on the free flow of 'qi' energy through body meridians, with disruptions causing illness and needle insertion restoring balance. Modern medicine does not recognize qi but investigates physiological mechanisms that may explain pain relief in some patients. Neurophysiologists, such as Dr. Li Wei from the University of Hong Kong, suggest acupuncture triggers the release of natural analgesics like adenosine and endogenous opioids, contributing to its pain-relieving effects. The placebo effect also plays a significant role, with rituals, atmosphere, and expectations amplifying brain response; a meta-analysis from the Chinese University of Hong Kong found sham acupuncture (insertion into random points) produced comparable results, confirming psychological influence. Evidence is strongest for pain management: a Cochrane review of nearly 5,000 participants showed 10 sessions reduced migraine frequency from 6 to 3\u20134 days per month. The UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends acupuncture for preventing chronic headaches and migraines. The American College of Physicians acknowledges it as part of non-pharmacological treatment, with 33 studies confirming pain reduction, though it does not outperform physical therapy. The British NICE considers it a possible option for primary chronic pain, though effects typically last no longer than three months. A 2012 meta-analysis found slight joint pain reduction, and the American College of Rheumatology permits its use as an adjunct if tolerated. However, UK experts note minimal clinical benefit and high costs, deeming it economically unjustifiable. Some patients use acupuncture for severe conditions like dementia, stroke, or infertility, but evidence does not support efficacy. A 2020 Cochrane review found no cognitive improvement in dementia patients, with studies suffering from weak methodology and small samples. A systematic analysis of 33 studies concluded acupuncture did not improve neurological outcomes, with positive results attributed to bias and placebo effects. Acupuncture during embryo transfer does not increase pregnancy or live birth rates, according to a Cochrane review of dozens of studies\u2014safe but clinically ineffective. The World Health Organization has established international standards to minimize risks, though serious complications are rare.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 10:38 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/health/2297380-acupuncture-secret-revealed/)\n\n**Active remote monitoring of long-term conditions with mobile devices: a systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses - npj Digital Medicine**\nA systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) published in npj Digital Medicine examined seven studies on mobile device-based active remote monitoring for long-term health conditions. Six of the seven studies found the interventions to be cost-effective, with four showing they were 'dominant'\u2014improving health outcomes (measured in quality-adjusted life years) while reducing healthcare costs. However, significant uncertainty exists in the joint distribution of incremental costs and health outcomes, which may hinder widespread adoption by decision-makers. The review highlights methodological limitations, including underreporting of health economic analysis plans, distributional effects, and patient engagement impacts due to recent reporting standards. No study conducted subgroup analyses to assess how population heterogeneity influenced cost-effectiveness. Most studies used trial-based designs, with uncertainty possibly due to non-inferiority/feasibility trial designs, underpowered superiority trials, or disparities in digital literacy and adherence. Decision-analytic models were underused (only two studies), despite their ability to extrapolate outcomes over lifetime horizons and support early-stage product development. Costing methods varied widely\u2014top-down costing yielded substantially lower estimates than bottom-up micro-costing\u2014suggesting potential underestimation of system costs if key resources are omitted. The review also notes that external dashboards, while easier to set up, impose workflow burdens on healthcare staff, and full integration with electronic health records requires significant infrastructure investment. Future research should prioritize decision-analytic modeling, explore non-randomized quasi-experimental designs, and investigate optimal monitoring frequencies. Additionally, broader perspectives beyond healthcare systems\u2014such as patient time costs and travel savings\u2014should be incorporated. The findings support the potential of mobile-based remote monitoring but caution that current evidence is insufficient to justify broad adoption due to persistent uncertainty. Developers and analysts are urged to improve transparency in upfront cost reporting and deepen exploration of uncertainty drivers to strengthen value propositions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 04:36 PM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01898-3)\n\n**Solving Clinical Dilemmas: How Evidence-Based Evaluation Is Rewriting Outcomes in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Failure**\nA landmark study led by Associate Professor Tao Zhongbin from the Pediatric PICU of Lanzhou University First Hospital, in collaboration with global institutions, has published the world\u2019s first network meta-analysis comparing different non-invasive respiratory support strategies for pediatric acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in The Lancet's subjournal, eClinicalMedicine. The research, based on data from 30 randomized controlled trials involving 8,163 children, found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective non-invasive ventilation mode, significantly reducing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and treatment failure compared to conventional oxygen therapy. However, CPAP carries risks of intolerance and pressure injury. The study utilized network meta-analysis and GRADE evidence grading to ensure methodological rigor, with contributions from experts at Lanzhou University\u2019s Clinical Medical Research Center, the School of Public Health, and international partners including Chongqing Medical University Children\u2019s Hospital, Universidad de Antioquia, McMaster University, University of Geneva Global Health Institute, and Japan Institute for Medical Governance. The research was driven by clinical urgency and a commitment to evidence-based practice, especially for resource-limited settings where CPAP\u2019s simplicity and low cost make it ideal. The findings are expected to influence global clinical guidelines. Despite initial rejections due to methodological concerns, the team persisted, with lead author Dr. Feng Yandong noting low morale but unwavering resolve under Tao\u2019s leadership.

The analysis, based on 69 trials involving over 7,000 mother-infant pairs, found that placing babies on their mother's bare chest within the first hour of birth significantly improves breastfeeding rates, body temperature regulation, blood sugar levels, and other critical health outcomes. The updated review includes 26 new studies added to the 2016 version, which already informed 20 international health guidelines, including those from the World Health Organization (WHO). In high- and middle-income countries, babies receiving immediate skin-to-skin contact were 20% more likely to be exclusively breastfed at one month (75% vs. 55%) compared to those separated from their mothers after birth. Karin Cadwell, senior author and Executive Director of the Healthy Children Project's Center for Breastfeeding, stated that withholding skin-to-skin contact is now considered unethical due to the overwhelming evidence of its benefits for newborn health and survival. The authors recommend future research focus on improving implementation, particularly in low-income settings where the practice could save lives, especially among low birth weight infants.

Loneliness is linked to depression, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and early mortality. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, social disconnection is as harmful to health as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. A meta-analysis of 280 studies involving over 30,000 participants found that all five major intervention types\u2014social support, social network creation, social and emotional skills training, psychological interventions (like cognitive behavioral therapy), and psychoeducation\u2014reduced loneliness, with psychological interventions showing the strongest effects. In-person programs were more effective than digital-only ones, and benefits lasted up to six months across children, adolescents, adults, and older adults.

This condition is linked to higher blood pressure and increased cardiovascular risk in adulthood, contributing to 25% of all deaths and costing \u00a329 billion annually in the UK. A meta-analysis by Romariz et al., published in Pediatric Research, demonstrates that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists\u2014such as liraglutide and semaglutide\u2014are effective for treating obesity in children aged 6\u201319, including those under 12 years, reducing body weight, BMI, and waist circumference. The analysis included 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,024 patients, with notable findings that liraglutide was effective in younger children, though only two trials evaluated liraglutide in children under 12, and only one tested semaglutide in adolescents aged 12\u201318. Tirzepatide, a more potent dual agonist, was not evaluated. GLP-1 agonists also showed efficacy regardless of type 2 diabetes status or agonist type. While gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and diarrhea occur, they are less severe in younger children, and few discontinue treatment due to serious adverse events. Compared to lifestyle interventions\u2014which yield only modest, short-term benefits\u2014and bariatric surgery\u2014which is effective but limited by complications and scalability\u2014pharmacological treatment with GLP-1 agonists presents a promising middle ground. However, challenges remain: these medications require daily or weekly injections, weight regain occurs rapidly after discontinuation, and long-term use may lead to high economic costs. Equity concerns exist, as obesity disproportionately affects children in deprived areas and ethnic minority groups, necessitating inclusive access and guidelines. Long-term solutions must also address the obesogenic environment through education, regulation, and policies such as sugary drink taxation. The biomedical community must provide robust evidence to inform healthcare regulators and policymakers on the cost-benefit trade-offs of childhood obesity interventions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-025-04483-2)\n\n**Study Calls for Greater Political Responsibility in Tackling Childhood Obesity**\nAccording to a new meta\u2011study led by Prof. Anna Lene Seidler of the University Medicine Rostock, prevention programmes aimed at parents have little effect on children\u2019s weight, physical activity or diet. The study analysed data from 29,000 children across 31 studies and found no significant changes in weight or behaviour. The authors argue that parents feel overwhelmed by time constraints, high costs of healthy food and socioeconomic pressures, which limits the impact of such programmes. In Germany the problem is growing: school\u2011entry examinations by the Ministry of Social Affairs report that one in five preschool children is overweight, and the number of affected children has risen by almost 50\u202f% over the past decade, according to the Barmer Health Insurance. Seidler stresses that long\u2011term success requires structural measures such as more green space, healthy food in kindergartens and schools, and political interventions like a sugar tax on unhealthy products. She cites examples from the United Kingdom and Mexico where such measures have lowered obesity rates. In Mecklenburg\u2011Vorpommern the state government is pursuing health goals, with programmes such as 'KinderBewegungsLand' and 'Gemeinsam Sport in Schule und Verein', but Seidler says these are insufficient. She hopes that Rostock will reform school meals to offer healthier alternatives.

As world leaders gather in New York for the annual UN meetings, renewed action on health must be a top priority. New articles in The BMJ illustrate the obstacles they face. Robert\u202fF\u202fKennedy\u202fJr, the US secretary of health and human services, is portrayed as the most public face of the anti\u2011science movement; his professed goal of \u2018making America healthy again\u2019 conflicts with his anti\u2011vaccine stance, his claims about autism, and his interference with the CDC. Simon\u202fWilliams notes that the Make\u202fAmerica\u202fHealthy\u202fAgain (MAHA) Commission report is notable for important omissions and a shortage of actionable details. Kennedy has focused on childhood obesity, which UNICEF reports is now more common worldwide than underweight for the first time ever, but the MAHA report treads lightly on recommendations that might alienate Trump constituencies such as farmers, ranchers, or the food industry. It fails to strongly recommend evidence\u2011based interventions such as taxing sugary drinks or regulating pesticides or food additives. \u2018Lobbyists have had their say,\u2019 suggests nutrition expert Marion\u202fNestle. Tobacco control policies endorsed by WHO and ratified by 183 countries have been called into question by conservative media. Guillermo\u202fParaje and colleagues find that evidence for these strategies is strong; taxes on tobacco are \u2018the single most cost effective tobacco control intervention\u2019 but are underused. They evaluated tobacco control policies in 165 countries, rating uptake on a scale of 1 to 5. The average score was 2.1 in the year of ratification and 2.7 a decade later.

Melchor says, 'El trabajo que hacemos es recoger la investigaci\u00f3n de los mejores evaluadores independientes, que nos permite donar a lo que esa investigaci\u00f3n recomienda, con deducci\u00f3n fiscal, y recibiendo un informe', highlighting the foundation\u2019s data\u2011driven approach.  He notes that a single donor in Spain can help thousands of people and \"salvar varias a lo largo de su vida\" by funding the most effective programs.\n\nThe piece cites concrete metrics: 800\u202fmillion people live in extreme poverty; each year between 250\u202f000 and 500\u202f000 children lose vision due to vitamin\u202fA deficiency, a problem that can be prevented for less than 2\u202f\u20ac per child per year; malaria prevention through long\u2011lasting insecticide\u2011treated nets costs about 5\u202f\u20ac per child.  GiveWell, the world\u2019s leading independent evaluator, invests roughly 60\u202f000 hours of research annually.  Melchor argues that the cost of saving a child\u2019s life in a poor country is \"menos que un caf\u00e9\".\n\nThe article also recounts Rory\u202fStewart\u2019s TED talk, where he describes a $40\u202f000 project in sub\u2011Saharan Africa that spent most of its budget on supervision and analysis rather than direct aid, illustrating the inefficiency of poorly targeted interventions.

Six\u2011 and seven\u2011year\u2011old students (n\u202f\u2248\u202f200) in German primary schools were assigned to a treatment group that received one 45\u2011minute working\u2011memory lesson per school day for five weeks. Follow\u2011up assessments were conducted at intervals ranging from three months to three years after the intervention. The researchers found substantial direct effects on working\u2011memory capacity that persisted across all follow\u2011up waves. Indirect effects were observed for geometry, fluid intelligence (measured by Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices), and inhibitory control; these effects did not appear immediately but grew over time, peaking after one year. Importantly, the study documented that working\u2011memory training increased the likelihood of students entering the academic track (Gymnasium) in secondary school, a factor that can influence university admission and future earnings. The article cites Robert\u202fHarding of the *Financial Times* (5\u20118\u20112025), who argues that cognitive improvements are a \u201cpotentially cheaper and more effective way to boost productivity\u201d and should be part of an industrial\u2011cognitive strategy for economic growth. The study\u2019s findings suggest that enhancing memory skills early in life could have long\u2011term benefits for education and the labor market.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 10:22 PM\nSource:[Sur](https://www.diariosur.es/opinion/rehabilitacion-capacidad-memoristica-20250914000100-nt.html)\n\n**Does Infant Obesity Prevention Really Work? A New Study Questions Its Effectiveness**\nA meta\u2011analysis led by the University of Sydney pooled 31 randomized controlled trials from ten countries, covering almost 29,000 children. The study found that preventive interventions delivered during the first year of life did not produce a statistically significant change in body mass index (BMI) at two years of age, calling into question the effectiveness of current early\u2011life obesity prevention programmes that focus on educating parents and caregivers.  \n\nKylie Hunter, the lead author, noted that \"the origin of obesity is deeply linked to environmental and socioeconomic factors beyond individual control,\" and urged a broader institutional and social response, including regulation of food advertising, improved access to green spaces and nutritious foods, especially for vulnerable populations.  \n\nAnna Lene Seidler of the University of Rostock added that family overload and stress hinder participation in conventional programmes, particularly in crisis contexts.  \n\nRecent evidence from The Lancet Public Health (2023) shows that policies targeting social, economic and environmental determinants\u2014such as restricting marketing of unhealthy foods\u2014are more effective than parent\u2011focused interventions alone.  Examples from the United Kingdom and Chile demonstrate that limiting exposure to misleading food advertising improves children\u2019s environments, as reported by the UK Public Health Office and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).  \n\nFAO data (2020) link the global rise in childhood obesity to socioeconomic disparities, reinforcing the need for comprehensive, equity\u2011focused strategies that combine education, regulation and supportive environments.  \n\nThe article explains that BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared, is the standard metric used to monitor child growth and early overweight risk.  It also highlights the importance of regulating ultra\u2011processed food advertising to children, noting that such regulation reduces pressure on families and improves dietary choices across socioeconomic groups.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/vivir-bien/bienestar/metaanalisis-revela-que-intervenciones-tempranas-no-previenen-obesidad-infantil-urge-enfoque-integral-PP4786017A)\n\n**School closures during COVID created massive long-term costs with limited health benefits**\nA study led by Oxford University's Department of Statistics and the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science found that school closures during the COVID\u201119 pandemic imposed enormous long\u2011term costs while other non\u2011pharmaceutical interventions delivered better health outcomes for far less money. The research, published in *BMC Global and Public Health*, analysed policies across U.S. states in 2020 before vaccines were available and examined eleven interventions, combining disease modelling with economic analysis. The study reports that school closures prevented roughly 77,200 COVID\u201119 deaths and reduced transmission rates by 8.2%, yet created \u00a31.6\u202ftrillion (\u2248$2\u202ftrillion) in future economic losses through damaged education, with students losing up to 0.35 school years of learning. In contrast, mask mandates cut transmission by 19% with minimal costs, and testing and contact\u2011tracing programmes proved efficient relative to their implementation costs. The authors estimate that an optimal combination of interventions could have reduced the pandemic\u2019s total U.S. impact from \u00a33.7\u202ftrillion to \u00a31.5\u202ftrillion, saving over 100,000 additional lives. The findings suggest that rapid deployment of testing, contact tracing, mask mandates, social distancing, and targeted facility closures could control future outbreaks without massive educational costs. The study\u2019s authors, Nicholas Irons and Adrian Raftery, emphasize the need for better national surveillance data and note that many measures mitigated economic damage in addition to suppressing transmission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2025 05:38 AM\nSource:[News-Medical.net](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250913/School-closures-during-COVID-created-massive-long-term-costs-with-limited-health-benefits.aspx)\n\n**Global inequality is huge  --  but so is the opportunity for people in high-income countries to support poor people**\nThe article explains that global income inequality is extreme\u2014 the average Dutch person earns more in two weeks than the average Malawian earns in a year\u2014 yet people in high\u2011income countries can still make a measurable impact. It cites a calculation by Pablo\u202fArriagada using World Bank data that shows the richest 10\u202f% would need to give up less than 2\u202fcents per dollar (less than one\u2011fiftieth of their income) to match the poorest 10\u202f%. The piece notes that foreign aid remains the largest redistribution channel, but most OECD donors fall short of the 0.15\u202f% pledge made in 1981; only Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway met the target in 2022. It warns that U.S. aid cuts could add 14\u202fmillion deaths by 2030. The article promotes evidence\u2011based giving through GiveWell and cash\u2011transfer charity GiveDirectly, which sends 8\u202f$ of every 10\u202f$ directly to recipients.

It begins by noting that the authors have declared no competing interests. STH, caused by four nematode species, are the leading cause of disability\u2011adjusted life years (DALYs) among helminth infections, with 1.9\u202fmillion DALYs lost in 2019\u2014a 53\u202f% reduction from 2000\u2014while 642.72\u202fmillion cases and 1.38\u202fmillion DALYs were estimated in 2021, including 293.80\u202fmillion ascariasis cases, 647.53\u202fthousand DALYs, and 3,472 deaths. WHO\u2019s 2020 target was 75\u202f% treatment coverage for preschool\u2011age and school\u2011age children, and the global elimination goal is <2\u202f% prevalence by 2030. Thailand\u2019s national program, running since 2002 with a 10\u2011year plan (2017\u20112026), aims to reduce STH prevalence below 5\u202f% by 2026; however, prevalence among school\u2011age children remained stable at 5\u202f% from 2015\u20112020. Current interventions include test\u2011and\u2011treat (TnT) and mass drug administration (MDA) with albendazole, using the Kato\u2011Katz technique for diagnosis. The article highlights that mathematical models\u2014such as age\u2011structured and community\u2011wide MDA (cMDA) models used in Kenya and the DeWorm3 project\u2014are essential for optimizing strategies. Models show that targeting only school\u2011age children may have limited impact, whereas cMDA can make elimination more plausible. The study models mean worm burden dynamics to evaluate interventions that could achieve Thailand\u2019s <5\u202f% target and the global <2\u202f% target, projecting outcomes for 2024\u20112033. The authors emphasize the importance of worm aggregation (parameter k) and its effect on transmission dynamics, noting that lower k values (greater aggregation) lower the infection breakpoint and influence control success.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013435)\n\n**Why Well-Intentioned Strategies Against Childhood Obesity Continue to Fail**\nRecent analyses show that common strategies against childhood obesity have had low or no impact, and offer clues on how to restructure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of children with excess weight (overweight and obesity) increased from 32 million in 2000 to 42 million in 2013, with a significant growth in Africa and Asia. The WHO recommends that countries develop robust policies to promote healthy diets, supervise effectively, and provide official guidelines; implement measures focused on early childhood, including regulating the advertising of ultra-processed foods to children; support research to elucidate the causes of excess weight and strategies to ensure safe, healthy, and diverse food; and create environments that favor regular physical activity. However, the containment of obesity among children and adolescents has failed. According to the WHO, an estimated 35 million children under 5 years old were overweight in 2024, and over 390 million children between 5 and 19 years old had excess weight, with a prevalence of 20% in 2022. The excess weight in this young population has negative consequences, including the early risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, as well as psychosocial impacts. A study published in the Journal of Tropical Pediatrics found that the prevalence of childhood obesity in Brazil was 12.2%, with a significant variation between states, ranging from 2.6% to 15.8%. Projections indicate that Brazil will have around 7.7 million obese children and adolescents by 2030, ranking fifth in the world. A Cochrane Library review found that interventions focused on diet or physical activity alone had little or no impact on body mass index (BMI) in the short, medium, or long term. Only combined interventions, addressing both dietary and physical components, showed modest effects on reducing BMI, but these effects were not sustained in the long term. A more recent review found that adopting specific implementation strategies can significantly increase the effectiveness of school-based interventions aimed at promoting healthy diets, physical activity, and obesity prevention. In other words, while isolated interventions on diet or physical activity have shown little or no impact on preventing obesity, strategic planning and structured implementation may be the key to generating measurable impact. According to the WHO, the failure of school-based interventions may not be in the content or proposal, but in the way they are applied - without support, continuity, and adherence from the various agents involved.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: August 12, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/saude/obesidade-infantil-por-que-as-estrategias-mais-bem-intencionadas-seguem-fracassando/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is an overwhelming consensus that at the end of 2025, at least one of GiveWell's top charities will perform mass deworming as its primary intervention. All forecasters point to the historical persistence and status quo inertia of deworming on GiveWell\u2019s top charity list, the lack of any major new negative evidence or sectoral scandal in 2025, and GiveWell's cautious, deliberative process for updating recommendations. Several note that GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness models, even when deeply discounting for evidentiary uncertainty, continue to rank mass deworming among the most cost-effective interventions. The possibility for abrupt removal is considered only if a major, credible new randomized trial or meta-analysis emerges before year-end or if GiveWell\u2019s operational model shifts so substantially that discretionary grantmaking drops deworming below 10% of funds\u2014neither of which is currently suggested by news or sector developments. Other factors supporting a high probability of continued deworming recommendations include operational stability of deworming charities, sustained demand from national governments, the absence of major donor revolt, and the fine print of the resolution criteria allowing for a positive outcome under various scenarios. Across all responses, probability estimates for a Yes outcome cluster tightly in the mid- to high-90s percentile range (94-98%), with only minor discounts for theoretical tail risks such as unforeseen evidence shocks or scandals.",
