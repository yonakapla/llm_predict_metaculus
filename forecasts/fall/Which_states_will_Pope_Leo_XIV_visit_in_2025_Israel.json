Current events make a visit logistically, diplomatically, and symbolically hazardous: 1) Ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, 2) Tense Vatican-Israel relations as evidenced by direct papal criticism and the negative fall-out from the Gaza parish bombing, 3) All credible Vatican-watchers and local Church authorities point only to Turkey and Lebanon for 2025, not Israel; 4) Papal protocol prefers to avoid politicization of visits\u2014appearing in Israel before major breakthroughs could be interpreted (by either side) as legitimizing or condemning one party, a situation Rome assiduously avoids; 5) Security concerns make an open, public apostolic visit to Israel in 2025 extremely unlikely unless the security environment rapidly improves. While the Pope has a strong interest in peace and the safety of Holy Land Christians, the probability he will visit Israel in an official state capacity before January 1, 2026 remains low and would require transformative developments in the region.

Furthermore, you downplay the capacity of the Holy See to act disruptively if it wanted to, citing the risks but not the sometimes radical nature of Catholic peacemaking. Your forecast lands in the right range, but by drawing too sharp a line under 'absent evidence of planning or public confirmation', you ignore the Vatican's long track record of sudden, high-stakes deployments when political or ecumenical opportunity knocks.

However, critiques within the group discussion highlighted the Vatican's potential, if highly unlikely, for disruptive or last-minute diplomacy in extraordinary circumstances.

While it is acknowledged (both in my argument and by informed critics/defenders in the group) that the Vatican is sometimes capable of radical and rapid diplomatic action, the absence of any planning signals, unprecedented logistical hurdles, and the lack of any movement within the Church or Israeli authorities reinforce the base rate.

However, no forecaster presented evidence or institutional precedent that would shift the main constraints: war, Vatican-Israel strain, and lack of preparation. I agree that security/logistics are not hard absolutes, but none of the deliberators credibly countered the fact that not only is there no momentum for such a visit, but all Vatican action and signaling point elsewhere (Turkey, Lebanon).

The discussion focused on the dire situation in Gaza, the need to release hostages, end the Israeli offensive and guarantee humanitarian aid for Palestinians. No concrete progress was reported, but the Vatican continues to push for a cease\u2011fire that would enable negotiations and halt the ongoing massacre. The Pope\u2019s invitation to Herzog was unprecedented; normally the Vatican grants audience requests, but here the Pope himself extended the invitation. Mateo\u202fBruni, Director of the Vatican\u2019s Press Office, explained that \"es pr\u00e1ctica de la Santa Sede conceder solicitudes de audiencia con el Pont\u00edfice de los jefes de estado y de gobierno. No es habitual extenderles invitaciones\". Herzog\u2019s visit followed a telephone call from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud\u202fAbbas on 21\u202fJuly\u202f2024, during which the Vatican said the conversation centred on the Gaza conflict and the need for humanitarian access. No further official contacts have been announced. The article notes that Donald\u202fTrump has denied a visa to Abbas and his delegation for the UN General Assembly in New\u202fYork, which will run until 29\u202fSeptember. Pope Leo\u202fXIV repeatedly condemned Israeli bombings in Gaza. On 23\u202fAugust he stated that \"todos los pueblos, tambi\u00e9n los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os y d\u00e9biles, deben ser respetados por los m\u00e1s poderosos en su identidad y en sus derechos, y nadie puede obligarlos al exilio forzado\". Cardinal Pietro\u202fParolin, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary of State, expressed shock at the killing of journalists in Gaza and questioned whether the attack on a Catholic parish was intentional. Netanyahu later called Parolin to apologise. Herzog expressed gratitude for the meeting, saying he \"anhela el d\u00eda en que los pueblos de Oriente Medio \u2013los Hijos de Abraham\u2013 vivan juntos en paz, cooperaci\u00f3n y esperanza\" and highlighted Israel\u2019s efforts to bring hostages home.

God wants peace!' and encouraging continued prayers for the Holy\u202fLand, Ukraine, and all war\u2011torn regions. He warned that 'apparent victories achieved through weapons, sowing death and destruction, are in fact defeats, and they never bring peace or security.' The Pope\u2019s remarks came amid the 700th day of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, during which Israel has killed over 64,000 Palestinians and the enclave faces famine. The International Criminal Court had issued arrest warrants in November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav\u202fGallant on war\u2011crimes charges, and Israel faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. The Vatican\u2019s statement reflects the Pope\u2019s call for dialogue and non\u2011violence, citing the need to break the spiral of hatred.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 02:04 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/pope-leo-xiv-urges-peace-in-mideast-ukraine-worldwide/3680663)\n\n**Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem: 'All Red Lines Have Been Crossed in the Gaza War' | El Comercio: Diario de Asturias**\nThe interview with Pierbattista Pizaballa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, focuses on the Gaza war and the broader Israeli\u2011Palestinian conflict. He describes the situation as \"definitely a war\" and a \"crime,\" rejecting the use of terms such as genocide or apartheid as politically manipulated labels, stating: 'Definitivamente es una guerra. Y es un crimen.' He recalls offering himself to Hamas in October 2023 as a substitute for Israeli hostages, saying: 'Por supuesto. No entiendo por qu\u00e9 a la gente le sorprenden tanto estas cosas.' Pizaballa criticizes the lack of international unity, noting that the European Union is merely a collection of countries with their own agendas. He emphasizes the need for humanitarian action rather than political intervention, adding: 'Lo que creo que podemos hacer es, en primer lugar, expresar nuestra opini\u00f3n y dar expresi\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n a la voz de nuestros pueblos.' He also comments on the role of the Vatican and Pope Leo\u202fXIV, describing the papal emphasis on peace and dialogue as \"esl\u00f3ganes\" that do not translate into concrete action in the Middle East. Pizaballa stresses the importance of maintaining interreligious relations with Muslims and Jews, while acknowledging that public dialogue is currently impossible due to the trauma of the war. He concludes that hope remains, but solutions are not imminent, and that the Church must continue to provide pastoral and humanitarian support without becoming a political instrument.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 06:32 PM\nSource:[El Comercio](https://www.elcomercio.es/internacional/oriente-proximo/patriarca-latino-jerusalen-lineas-rojas-cruzadas-guerra-20250905203245-ntrc.html)\n\n**LGBTQ+ Catholics make Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, acknowledging new sense of acceptance**\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families joined a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, celebrating what they see as a new level of acceptance within the Catholic Church. Bishop Franceseco Savino celebrated Mass at the Chiesa del Gesu, receiving a standing ovation when he recalled that the Jubilee was \"the time to free the oppressed and restore dignity to those who had been denied it.\" LGBTQ+ groups such as Jonathan's Tent, DignityUSA and Outreach organized the pilgrimage, which was listed in the Vatican\u2019s official calendar but not endorsed. DignityUSA\u2019s Marianne Duddy Burke remembered being detained 25 years ago during a previous Holy Year. A 2020 UCLA Williams Institute study estimated 11.3\u202fmillion LGBTQ adults in the U.S., 5.3\u202fmillion of whom are religious and about 1.3\u202fmillion Roman Catholic. Pope Leo XIV held a special Jubilee audience for all pilgrim groups but made no special mention of LGBTQ+ Catholics. Pilgrims attribute their sense of welcome to Pope Francis, who in 2013 said, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Francis\u2019s inclusive tone contrasted with predecessors John\u202fPaul\u202fII and Benedict\u202fXVI, who were less accepting. Pope Leo XIV has expressed support for Francis\u2019s policy of LGBTQ+ inclusion. Participants such as John Capozzi said Francis\u2019s attitude helped them return to the church after years of feeling shunned.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 02:22 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lgbtq-catholics-make-holy-year-pilgrimage-to-rome/)\n\n**Pope Leo XIV to canonize two modern saints this weekend as faithful flock to Rome**\nOn September 6, 2025, Pope Leo XIV is scheduled to preside over the canonization of Carlo Acutis, a millennial computer programmer, and Pier Giorgio Frassati, an Italian student and outdoorsman, in St. Peter's Square. Fr. Charlie Gallagher, pastor of Immaculate Conception Church in Washington, D.C., travelled to Rome for the ceremony. He described the atmosphere as 'The atmosphere here is already one of expectant joy, even electric,' and said he expects a crowd of at least 250,000 worshipers on Sunday. The Vatican anticipates that over 32 million pilgrims will travel during the Jubilee year, according to the U.S. Embassy in Italy. Gallagher, who has known Frassati\u2019s niece Wanda for 20 years, said he took Frassati as his patron and that Pope John Paul\u202fII called him the 'Man of the Beatitudes.' He also noted that Acutis, though academically challenged, devoted himself to spreading devotion to the Eucharist. Pope Francis had previously championed Acutis\u2019s cause, and Leo XIV has highlighted technology, especially artificial intelligence, as a major challenge. The article also mentions Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, who reports on the cathedral\u2019s restoration five years after the 2019 fire. Gallagher lived in Rome for four years while a seminarian at the North American College in 2007, and he recalls that Pier Giorgio died in 1925 and his sister Luciana gave birth to Wanda in 1926.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 06, 2025 11:51 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/pope-leo-xiv-canonize-two-modern-saints-weekend-faithful-flock-rome)\n\n**Pope and Israeli President Meet to Discuss Gaza Crisis**\nThe Vatican hosted a meeting between Pope Leo XIV and Israeli President Isaac Herzog on 5 September 2025. They discussed the 'tragic situation in Gaza', the need to guarantee a future for the Palestinian people, and the urgent need for a permanent ceasefire. The Holy See said it had 'expected a prompt resumption of negotiations' and that 'all hostages should be liberated'. Herzog thanked the Pope for the 'warm reception' but avoided speaking directly about Gaza, instead urging religious leaders to 'raise their voices to demand the release of hostages'. After the audience, Herzog met with Vatican officials Pietro Parolin and Paul R. Gallagher, where they talked about the political and social situation in the Middle East, the Palestinian future, and the two\u2011state solution. The Israeli president also highlighted freedom of worship and Israel's pride in its Christian community. The Vatican confirmed that it also discussed relations between state authorities and the local church. Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares said Europe must do more to address the violence in Palestine and proposed measures such as an arms embargo on Israel. Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Abulgheit condemned the US decision to revoke Palestinian diplomats' visas for the UN General Assembly. Several countries, including France, the UK, Australia and Canada, announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 01:55 AM\nSource:[Peri\u00f3dico El D\u00eda](https://eldia.com.do/el-papa-y-presidente-israeli-se-reunen-tratan-drama-de-gaza)\n\n**Pope\u2019s Prayer to Israeli President: 'Courage Needed: Ceasefire Now'**\nOn 4 September 2025, Pope Leo XIV met Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the Holy See.

Herzog, in a social\u2011media post, noted that it has been 700 days since the kidnapping of 48 of his compatriots still in Gaza, calling for the immediate release of hostages and expressing concern over rising antisemitism. He thanked the Pope for his warm reception and reaffirmed Israel\u2019s commitment to safeguard Christian communities in the Holy Land. The Vatican\u2019s final communiqu\u00e9 reiterated the two\u2011state solution, urged the international community to support a permanent ceasefire, safe humanitarian aid, and respect for humanitarian law, and called for the release of all hostages.

According to the Vatican Press Office, the meeting focused on the 'tr\u00e1gica situa\u00e7\u00e3o em Gaza' and the need for negotiations that lead to a lasting solution. The Pope urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, safe entry of humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages still held by Hamas. He reiterated that 'Uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de dois Estados \u00e9 a \u00fanica sa\u00edda para a guerra', highlighting the importance of a two\u2011state solution and also drawing attention to events in the West Bank and the status of Jerusalem. After the meeting, Herzog met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, and Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary for Relations with States and International Organizations, where the importance of Christian communities in the Middle East for social cohesion, education and regional stability was emphasized. The Vatican\u2019s appeal comes amid growing international pressure on Israel and on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been criticized by world leaders for Gaza offensives and restrictions on supplies entering the enclave. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would officially recognize a Palestinian state, joining 147 UN member states. Canada is expected to announce support for a Palestinian state at the next UN General Assembly, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has already expressed a favourable position for the two\u2011state solution.

He stressed that a two\u2011state solution is the sole path to ending the war and restoring regional stability. According to a Vatican press release, the conflict that began on 7\u202fOctober\u202f2023 has already claimed more than 64,000 Palestinian deaths and 161,000 injuries, largely among children and women, and has left thousands missing, displaced, and starving. The Pope and his delegation, including Cardinal Pietro\u202fBarolini, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary of State, called for respect of humanitarian law, safe delivery of aid, and the release of all hostages, asserting that the legitimate aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis can only be met through a two\u2011state solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\u202fNetanyahu faces mounting domestic and international pressure to halt the war, amid accusations of delaying peace for political survival. President Hertzog, on X, said he discussed with the Pope ways to strengthen peace and that Israel is doing everything possible to free hostages held by Hamas, urging religious leaders to support immediate release as a step toward a better future for the region. The visit comes amid rising tensions between the Vatican and Israel, following Pope Francis\u2019s criticism of the Gaza war and the Israeli strike on a Catholic church in July. Vatican observers see the Pope\u2019s recent stance as additional diplomatic and moral pressure on Israel, potentially revitalizing the Catholic Church\u2019s role as a spiritual mediator in the Israeli\u2011Palestinian conflict.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 05:14 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6687313)\n\n**Pope Leo XIV discusses Gaza, 2-state solution with Israeli president**\nOn September 4, 2025, Pope Leo XIV met privately with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the Vatican. According to a Vatican statement, the talks focused on the political and social situation in the Middle East and the need to guarantee 'a future for the Palestinian people and peace and stability in the region', with the Holy See reiterating the two\u2011state solution as the only way out of the ongoing war. Herzog also met Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Vatican Secretary for Relations with States Archbishop Paul Gallagher. In a post on X, Herzog thanked Leo for a 'warm welcome today at the Vatican' and said he looked forward to strengthening Israel's cooperation with the Holy See 'for a better future of justice and compassion.' The Vatican communique, longer than usual, called for a resumption of negotiations, a permanent ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages, respect for humanitarian law, and safe entry of aid into Gaza, and expressed hope that the 'legitimate aspirations' of both Israeli and Palestinian peoples could be guaranteed. It also referenced the situation in the West Bank, the city of Jerusalem, and relations between Israeli authorities and the local Church. The Vatican reiterated its call for an international status for Jerusalem, where Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa serves as Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and of the Palestinian territories. During a July visit to Taybeh, Pizzaballa and other Church leaders accused Israeli authorities of 'facilitating and enabling' attacks on Palestinian Christians by settlers. The meeting also touched on ensuring the continued presence of Christian communities throughout the Middle East. Herzog\u2019s statement after the talks highlighted the great significance of the relationship between the Holy See, the State of Israel, and the Jewish people, and the importance of sensitive issues and challenges. A tension arose when Herzog\u2019s office had earlier stated that the visit was at the Pope\u2019s invitation, but the Vatican clarified that it only agrees to requests for audiences from heads of state. The article notes that Vatican\u2011Israel relations had been strained during Pope Francis\u2019s pontificate, when he criticized Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza and called it 'terrorism' and possibly 'genocide'. Pope Leo has taken a more restrained approach, calling for ceasefires, the release of hostages, dignified humanitarian aid, and respect for law.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 04:14 PM\nSource:[Catholic World Report](https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2025/09/04/pope-leo-xiv-discusses-gaza-2-state-solution-with-israeli-president/)\n\n**Vatican, seminar on 'Creation, nature, environment for a world of peace' - Vatican News**\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Holy See, will open the international seminar \"Creation, nature, environment for a world of peace\" on 11 September at 15:00 in Casina Pio IV, Vatican City.

The meeting follows weeks of tension over Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza and settler attacks on Christian Palestinians in the West Bank, which the Holy See has sharply criticized.  According to official statements, the two leaders will focus on \"the efforts to secure the release of hostages, the fight against global antisemitism and the protection of Christian communities in the Middle East,\" as well as other political matters.  The Vatican\u2019s spokesperson, Matteo\u202fBruni, clarified that the meeting was not initiated by a papal invitation but was \"co\u2011ordinated jointly\" by the diplomatic services of both countries.  The meeting comes after Israel\u2019s July bombing of the only Catholic parish in Gaza, an incident the Vatican described as a possible error and a violation of human\u2011rights law.  Catholic organisations such as Caritas International and Pax\u202fChristi have called for an immediate cease\u2011fire and have urged the Pope to visit Gaza to pressure Israeli authorities.  Pope Leo\u202fXIV has repeatedly condemned the use of starvation as a weapon of war and has urged an end to indiscriminate violence.  President Herzog will also meet with Cardinal Pietro\u202fParolin and visit the Vatican archives during his one\u2011day tour.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/internacional/20250904/papa-presidente-israel-reunion-gaza-iglesia-121207969)\n\n**Pope Leo in Lebanon?

The preparations for the visit are underway, although the official date has not been set yet. The Vatican has expressed a genuine interest in completing this visit to Lebanon, which is home to over 2 million Catholics, according to Vatican statistics. A Lebanese official, speaking to Reuters, stated that 'the consultations are ongoing regarding the visit, with the date to be set in the coming weeks.' The Vatican spokesperson declined to comment directly on Cardinal Rai's statements. The visit may be part of a broader tour that includes Turkey, where the Pope is expected to participate in the celebration of the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea in the city of \u0130znik. Pope Leo had expressed his desire to participate in this event in July, saying, 'I hope to be able to meet you again in a few months to participate in the ecumenical celebration of the Council of Nicaea.' In a message to participants in a youth religious conference in Ankara, according to the Monitor newspaper. The Pope has expressed his deep solidarity with the Lebanese people in the fifth anniversary of the Beirut port explosion, saying, 'Lebanon, the beloved and suffering, remains in our prayers.' He added, 'The tears of Christ join our tears,' in a spiritual expression of his personal empathy with the suffering of the Lebanese people. The potential visit comes after a meeting between the Pope and Lebanese President Joseph Aoun on June 13th in the Vatican. According to church sources, the meeting was 'warm and symbolic,' and during which the commitment of the Holy See to support Lebanon's political and economic stability, and to maintain its religious diversity, which is a cornerstone of Lebanese identity, was reaffirmed. The two sides also discussed the file of reforms and ways to restore the confidence of the international community, as well as the central role of the Maronite Church in social cohesion. This meeting is seen as a preparatory step on the diplomatic level for a formal visit, which could be a turning point in the relations between the Vatican and Lebanon in the post-crisis period. Pope Leo, the first American to hold the papacy, tends to complete the spiritual and political line of his predecessor Francis, but adds a charismatic dimension to it. He has appeared in several occasions surrounded by young crowds, as happened during the 'Youth Jubilee' celebration in Rome, attended by hundreds of thousands from 146 countries. These popular events have shown that the new Pope does not limit himself to the symbolism of the papacy, but seeks to strengthen the global presence of the Church, particularly in areas experiencing crises, such as Lebanon and Turkey, which explains the deep dimensions of his upcoming tour.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 12:43 PM\nSource:[@Elaph](https://elaph.com/Web/News/2025/08/1575261.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All six forecasting experts converge on a very low probability that Pope Leo XIV will make a state visit to Israel before January 1, 2026. Their analyses highlight several consistent themes: (1) Historical precedent is strongly against such a visit\u2014no recent Pope has visited Israel in their first year, particularly during times of conflict; (2) The ongoing Gaza war and strained Vatican\u2013Israel relations, exacerbated by Vatican criticism of Israeli military actions and damage to Christian sites in Gaza, make such a visit diplomatically and logistically hazardous; (3) Official Vatican planning and news leaks focus exclusively on Turkey (for the Nicaea anniversary) and Lebanon, with no credible signs of preparatory activity for an Israel trip; (4) Security risks for a papal visit to Israel are considered prohibitive in the current context; (5) While some soft power, interfaith, or peacemaking motivations could theoretically prompt a last-minute visit if an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough occurs, experts agree this remains a remote scenario. Probability estimates among the experts range narrowly from 5% to 8%. The consensus is that unless there is a dramatic and unforeseen de-escalation of the conflict or major political development, Pope Leo XIV will not visit Israel in 2025."
