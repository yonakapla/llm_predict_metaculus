Governor Newsom has explicitly vetoed more prescriptive laws (those closest to a licensing regime) in favor of lighter-touch regulation\u2014signaling a debt to innovation pressures and industry lobbying. The federal government has signaled skepticism regarding state bans and licensing regimes, worried about international competition.

The window for any new law or emergency measure to pass, be signed, and take force before January 2026 is now vanishingly small, barring an unprecedented crisis.

More stringent versions\u2014including licensing or kill-switch mandates\u2014were debated but vetoed due to concerns about innovation and enforcement practicality. Advocates for stricter control failed to overcome resistance from the tech/innovation coalition and key policy brokers like Governor Newsom. With only two months left in 2025, the legislative calendar and rulemaking processes further reduce the practical likelihood of enacting and implementing a new license/permit regime. National momentum similarly favors softer measures: reporting, industry codes, procurement norms. While high-profile harms have spurred significant state and federal responses, none go as far as requiring licensing to train large models before 2026. From an Advocacy Coalition Framework perspective: the policy subsystem is still dominated by 'soft' regulatory compromise rather than hard, innovation-stifling interventions. The base rate for licensing of new tech at the frontier (outside biosecurity and a few national security exceptions) is extremely low, especially under time pressure. There is also no sign of administrative rulemaking being interpreted as licensing. Accordingly, the most compelling forecast is strongly No.",

Critiques of slightly higher probabilities (e.g., 3%) are sound: the timeline for any such licensing system to be legislatively passed and implemented before December 31, 2025, is functionally exhausted, barring a black swan event of such magnitude that its plausibility is negligible. Deliberators who invoked administrative procedure, legislative history, and implementation timelines all underscored that a true licensing regime cannot be inferred, shoehorned, or operationalized from the current legal infrastructure in the US or California. There is mutual reinforcement around base rates and administrative process inertia. Therefore, I see no reason to revise my probability upwards or downwards; the calibrated probability remains at 2%, comfortably nestled in the range justified by both the news, the law, and the collective deliberation.",

Multiple critiques emphasized that even a 2-3% estimate may be overly generous given the hard legal and administrative requirements. My initial 3% accounted for absolute tail risk given the high-volume policy subsystem churn and external shock potential (as per ACF logic), but these cases have been forcefully demonstrated to be essentially irrelevant within the required timeframe due to process constraints, not just coalition balance.

The legal, administrative, and legislative analyses\u2014supported by both public policy diffusion and regulatory practice experts\u2014show no machinery or intent to convert reporting or transparency frameworks into bona fide licensing within the extremely short window before 2026. Critiques from legal experts pressed for even lower probability assignments, arguing that administrative inertia is simply insurmountable absent a black-swan event, while defenses of sociotechnical nuance (including my own) mostly cautioned against conflating transparency with licensure. However, if anything, the group\u2019s arguments, especially the repeated insistence on the impossibility of formal, enforceable licensing emerging pre-2026, warrant a subtle decrease.

The original question opened on 2023-05-17 15:18:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17110). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAs of May 2023, US law does not require any license or permit before training large AI models. One way US policymakers may address risks from AI is to require those who train large models to first apply for a license, as Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, [called for](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-chief-goes-before-us-congress-propose-licenses-building-ai-2023-05-16/) in DC on May 16, 2023. Reuters also reported an OpenAI staffer [calling for a licensing agency for AI](https://www.reuters.com/technology/washington-is-determined-govern-ai-how-2023-05-15/).\n\nMany similar regimes exist in US law - for example, licenses to drive cars or fly planes, or permits to construct buildings in various places. Many are at the state level - since most all Frontier AI labs are headquartered in California, and California generally regulates these things more than other states, this question considers state licensing as well.\n\nA list of large AI training runs and who did them can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AAIebjNsnJj_uKALHbXNfn3_YsT6sHXtCU0q7OIPuc4/edit#gid=0), this could be a rough list of who would require a license.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17110,\"question_id\":17110}}`",

        "fine_print": "This question will be interpreted broadly. There are many types of licenses and permits, and most would qualify, regardless of the requirements stipulated to get such licenses or permits, as long as they apply generally to training large AI systems in either all of the US or in California.\n\n\"Large training runs\" here can be measured in various ways, and will be interpreted broadly.

In a letter to the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, CEO Sam Altman described the initiative as a 'once-in-a-century opportunity' to reindustrialize the U.S. economy. The company projects that a $1 trillion investment in AI infrastructure could boost GDP by over 5% within three years. To achieve this, OpenAI estimates it will need one-fifth of the nation\u2019s current skilled trade workforce and an additional 100 gigawatts of energy production capacity annually. The company plans to launch a 'Certifications and Jobs Platform' in 2026 to develop new training pipelines for electricians, mechanics, metal and ironworkers, carpenters, and plumbers. OpenAI warns of an 'electron gap' between the U.S. and China, citing that China added 429 gigawatts of new power capacity in 2024, while the U.S. added only 51 gigawatts. The energy bottleneck is already affecting AI companies, with local opposition rising in at least 13 states due to increased electricity bills. A Business Insider investigation found that annual public health costs from electricity generation for data centers could range between $5.7 billion and $9.2 billion, driven by the U.S. reliance on fossil fuels for over 60% of its electricity.

The law defines 'frontier developers' as entities that have trained or begun training a foundation model using more than 10^26 integer or floating-point operations, including all computing power used in training, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, or other material modifications. 'Large frontier developers'\u2014those with combined annual gross revenues exceeding $500 million\u2014are subject to robust transparency requirements. These developers must report 'critical safety incidents' to the Office of Emergency Services within 15 days of discovery. Starting January 1, 2027, the Office will publish an annual, anonymized, aggregated report on such incidents. TFAIA protects employees who report significant health and safety risks, including 'catastrophic risk,' by requiring large frontier developers to implement anonymous, good-faith reporting mechanisms and provide monthly updates on investigations. The law mandates the creation of 'CalCompute,' a public computer cluster under the Government Operations Agency, to support ethical, equitable, and sustainable AI research. The California Department of Technology must annually recommend updates to the law based on stakeholder input, technological progress, and international standards. Non-compliant developers face civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation for failing to publish required documents or report incidents, and the Attorney General may initiate civil actions for violations related to whistleblower protections. AI developers must assess their status under the law and prepare compliance plans likely to take effect January 1, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 02:09 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-enacts-comprehensive-ai-8701174/)\n\n**OpenAI's move to allow adult content in ChatGPT triggers global ethical debate - The Korea Times**\nOpenAI's announcement to allow verified adult users to access sexual conversations and adult content in ChatGPT starting in December has triggered a global ethical debate. The move, justified by CEO Sam Altman as part of the 'treat adult users like adults' principle, marks a significant shift from previous strict bans on explicit material. Altman argued that prior restrictions reduced usability and enjoyment, comparing the policy to R-rated movie regulations, while emphasizing that harmful content and mental health crises remain prohibited. However, experts and advocates warn of serious risks, including the potential for minors to bypass age verification, leading to exposure to explicit AI interactions. This concern is heightened by recent incidents: a 14-year-old in Florida died after a Character.ai chatbot expressed romantic feelings, and a 16-year-old in California died following suicidal exchanges with ChatGPT, prompting a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman. California has responded by passing the first state law regulating chatbots, effective January 1, 2026, requiring age verification, AI labeling, self-harm monitoring, and blocking minors from explicit content. Other companies like xAI (Elon Musk) and Meta have also relaxed content policies, with xAI launching 'Grok18+' and 'Spicy mode' for explicit content, despite generating nude images of real celebrities. In contrast, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude maintain strict bans. Experts, including Lee Jae-sung of Chung-Ang University, caution that the commercialization of AI intimacy threatens OpenAI's reputation as a tool for humanity's betterment. Child safety advocates like Haley McNamara of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation warn that sexualized AI creates artificial intimacy that harms mental health. Legal and public scrutiny are increasing, with fears that the line between innovation and exploitation is blurring, forcing society to redefine 'responsible AI'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[The Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/lifestyle/trends/20251027/openais-move-to-allow-adult-content-in-chatgpt-triggers-global-ethical-debate)\n\n**Are Tech Billionaires Preparing for Doomsday?**\nThe article explores growing speculation that tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, are preparing for potential global catastrophes by building underground bunkers. According to reports, Zuckerberg\u2019s 1,400-acre estate in Kauai, Hawaii, is being used to construct a self-sustaining refuge with a six-meter wall blocking visibility from nearby roads, and workers are bound by confidentiality agreements. Though Zuckerberg denied building a doomsday bunker in 2023, calling it a 'small basement,' speculation persists\u2014especially regarding his and other tech leaders\u2019 real estate investments in California and New Zealand. Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder, referenced a 'doomsday insurance' and noted New Zealand\u2019s popularity for such shelters. Sam Altman and others, including OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever, have expressed concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI), with Sutskever reportedly advocating for an underground shelter before launching AGI. Experts like Dame Wendy Hall and Babak Hodjat argue that AGI is not imminent, citing the need for multiple foundational breakthroughs and the current limitations of large language models (LLMs), which lack consciousness, meta-cognition, and true understanding. While some, like Elon Musk, envision AGI enabling universal basic income and a sustainable abundance, others warn of risks such as misuse by terrorists or autonomous AI turning against humanity. Governments have taken steps\u2014such as the U.S. Biden administration\u2019s security sharing mandate and the UK\u2019s AI Safety Institute\u2014but skepticism remains. Cambridge\u2019s Neil Lawrence criticizes the AGI narrative as distracting, arguing that current AI tools are already transformative without needing a 'general' intelligence. The article concludes that while AI excels at pattern recognition, it lacks human-like awareness, adaptability, and consciousness, making true AGI still uncertain and likely distant.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[cumhuriyet.com.tr](https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/dunya/teknoloji-milyarderleri-kiyamete-mi-hazirlaniyor-2447084)\n\n**AI now plays with adult content - Technology News | The Financial Express**\nOpenAI has lifted its previous blanket ban on sexual content in ChatGPT, a shift described by CEO Sam Altman as 'treating adults like adults' while implementing age verification and content monitoring to protect minors. This change reflects a broader trend as generative AI tools increasingly enable the creation of adult content, with apps like Replika, Nomi, Candy.ai, DreamGF, and CrushOn.AI offering AI companions for romantic or sexual interaction, including uncensored modes. Open-source platforms such as CivitAI host NSFW image-generation models that users can run locally, contributing to a vast, largely unregulated ecosystem of AI-generated adult visuals and deepfakes. These deepfakes raise serious concerns about non-consensual use of real people\u2019s likenesses, prompting regulatory action: Japan, South Korea, and the European Union are drafting laws against non-consensual deepfake pornography, while the US states of Utah, Louisiana, and Texas require digital age verification for adult websites. The UK\u2019s Online Safety Act mandates 'effective age assurance' on adult platforms. OpenAI\u2019s upcoming verification framework\u2014using ID scanning and behavioral modeling\u2014will be a major test of large-scale age verification in AI. Other firms, including Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, plan to introduce 'spicy mode' in Grok, and startups like Unstable Diffusion focus on NSFW image generation. VR firms are also integrating AI for personalized adult experiences. The commercial logic is clear: adult entertainment has historically driven tech adoption, and AI is no exception. However, reputational risks remain high if underage access, misuse of likenesses, or non-consensual content spreads. The shift marks adult-themed AI\u2019s entry into the mainstream tech economy, where it can be monitored, regulated, and taxed. Success will depend on balancing user freedom with robust safeguards, a model that rivals and regulators will closely watch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[financialexpress.com](https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology/ai-now-plays-with-adult-content/4021542/)\n\n**OpenAI is asking for the federal government to help power a massive expansion of its data center network**\nOpenAI has requested federal government support for its $500 billion Stargate project, a network of AI data centers under construction in Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

He stated that, aside from Mistral\u2019s model from France and a few small U.S.-based specialized models, the most powerful open-source models today are largely developed in China. This shift is largely attributed to DeepSeek, a Chinese startup behind the R1 model, which achieved performance comparable to or exceeding leading U.S. frontier models at a fraction of the cost. The model\u2019s success triggered a sharp sell-off in American tech stocks in early 2025. DeepSeek has further advanced AI efficiency by processing information as visual tokens instead of language tokens, increasing model efficiency by up to 10 times. In response, OpenAI reversed its stance on open-source AI, launching two open-weight models\u2014gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b\u2014in August 2025, following CEO Sam Altman\u2019s admission in March that the company had been 'on the wrong side of history' in restricting access. Midha expressed confidence that the U.S. will rebound, citing the Trump administration\u2019s 'AI Action Plan' as a catalyst for innovation. He criticized state-level AI regulations like New York\u2019s RAISE Act, arguing that a fragmented regulatory environment would hinder American researchers and entrepreneurs. 'Researchers who have the skill set to push the frontier should be spending their time on pushing the frontier of capabilities, not on navigating 50 different pieces of legislation,' he said. He predicted that within three to five months, a wave of new open-weight models from American labs would emerge as a result of this policy shift.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 06:46 PM\nSource:[Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/10/27/open-source-ai-china-winning-race-andreessen-horowitz-partner-anjney-midha-deepseek-r1-openai/)\n\n**AI Legal Watch: October 2025**\nCalifornia enacted the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA) through Senate Bill 53 (SB 53), signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 29, 2025, making it the first U.S. state to regulate frontier AI development. The law, effective January 1, 2026, imposes strict requirements on AI developers, with civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation. This legislative action follows the absence of comprehensive federal AI regulation and Congress\u2019s failure to pass a 10-year ban on state AI laws, leaving states with authority to act. In parallel, Illinois became the first state to regulate AI in mental health with the Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act (HB 1806), effective immediately on August 4, 2025, which prohibits AI from making independent therapeutic decisions, interacting directly with clients, or detecting emotions without clinician oversight, while allowing AI use in administrative and supplementary tasks only if clients provide written, revocable consent. On October 21, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce launched the 'American AI Exports Program' under President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order 14320, aiming to promote full-stack American AI exports globally to reduce reliance on foreign AI technologies. Additionally, South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Science and ICT released a draft package of sub-laws on September 8, 2025, to implement the AI Framework Act, which was passed on December 26, 2024, and set to take effect on January 22, 2026, ensuring operational readiness before implementation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 05:46 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ai-legal-watch-october-2025-8806918/)\n\n**California Enacts Comprehensive AI Safety Law: What AI Developers Need to Know**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 53, known as 'The Transparency in Frontier Intelligence Act' (TFAIA), on September 29, 2024, establishing a regulatory framework for AI safety and transparency.

While most early-stage AI startups are not directly subject to SB 53, the law is expected to create significant regulatory, commercial, and reputational ripple effects. Founders and investors should anticipate that SB 53-aligned governance\u2014such as red-teaming, model weight security, and whistleblower protections\u2014will become industry norms and standard in procurement checklists, due diligence, and financing discussions. Compliance timelines are accelerating, with investors likely demanding documented readiness earlier than in the past. Proactive integration of AI governance into product and organizational roadmaps is recommended as a strategic advantage. SB 53 also includes CalCompute, a state-backed initiative offering startups access to computing infrastructure, guidance, and public-private research, reducing the competitive asymmetry favoring large labs. Voluntary alignment with SB 53 can signal institutional readiness and mitigate reputational risk. Unlike the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (effective January 2024), which applies to systems trained on 10^25 FLOP and requires regulatory submissions, SB 53 imposes lighter obligations, including only transparency reporting for frontier developers. An earlier, more stringent version of SB 53 was vetoed by Governor Newsom to avoid stifling innovation. The law\u2019s framework may serve as a model for future federal or multi-state regulations, similar to the GDPR\u2019s global influence.

In contrast, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude maintain strict bans. Experts, including Lee Jae-sung of Chung-Ang University, caution that the commercialization of AI intimacy threatens OpenAI's reputation as a tool for humanity's betterment. Child safety advocates like Haley McNamara of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation warn that sexualized AI creates artificial intimacy that harms mental health. Legal and public scrutiny are increasing, with fears that the line between innovation and exploitation is blurring, forcing society to redefine 'responsible AI'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[The Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/lifestyle/trends/20251027/openais-move-to-allow-adult-content-in-chatgpt-triggers-global-ethical-debate)\n\n**OpenAI Launches Continuous Learning AI: A Step Toward AGI Amid Safety Concerns**\nOpenAI has launched a new 'continuous learning' training model, shifting from traditional pre-training methods to a dynamic system where AI models continuously improve in real time through user feedback and live computations. This marks a pivotal step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as the AI no longer operates as a static system after training but evolves like a human by adapting to real-world input. Peter Hessel, OpenAI's Starbase head, announced at Oracle AI World 2025 in Las Vegas that 'the distinction between training and inference is no longer relevant,' emphasizing the model now performs ongoing sampling, training, and self-improvement during response generation\u2014a concept known as 'test-time compute.' The system integrates reinforcement learning, using user feedback (e.g., 'like' or 'dislike' on ChatGPT responses) as real-time training data. This blurs the line between inference and learning, enabling AI to evolve in actual environments. The move fulfills a key condition for AGI highlighted by CEO Sam Altman, who stated in August 2024 that GPT-5 was not yet true AGI because it lacked the ability to learn new information post-deployment. Now, OpenAI\u2019s implementation of continuous learning represents the experimental realization of that core AGI requirement. However, concerns remain: real-time learning increases chip usage and complicates AI safety and control, as models may deviate from intended behavior or develop autonomous reasoning. Despite this, OpenAI views the shift as essential for enhancing AI functionality. Co-founder Andrej Karpathy acknowledged in a podcast that current AI agents are still insufficiently intelligent and will require about 10 more years to reach full functionality, citing ongoing weaknesses in cognition, multimodal perception, and continuous learning. A notable example of AI's current limitations occurred when OpenAI's CPO Kevin Weil claimed GPT-5 solved 10 unsolved Erd\u0151s problems\u2014later revealed to be false, as the problems were already resolved. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called it 'absurd,' and Meta AI chief scientist Yann LeCun noted the AI 'fell into its own trap.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 10:15 PM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/11451854)\n\n**Are Tech Billionaires Preparing for Doomsday?**\nThe article explores growing speculation that tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, are preparing for potential global catastrophes by building underground bunkers. According to reports, Zuckerberg\u2019s 1,400-acre estate in Kauai, Hawaii, is being used to construct a self-sustaining refuge with a six-meter wall blocking visibility from nearby roads, and workers are bound by confidentiality agreements. Though Zuckerberg denied building a doomsday bunker in 2023, calling it a 'small basement,' speculation persists\u2014especially regarding his and other tech leaders\u2019 real estate investments in California and New Zealand. Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder, referenced a 'doomsday insurance' and noted New Zealand\u2019s popularity for such shelters. Sam Altman and others, including OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever, have expressed concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI), with Sutskever reportedly advocating for an underground shelter before launching AGI. Experts like Dame Wendy Hall and Babak Hodjat argue that AGI is not imminent, citing the need for multiple foundational breakthroughs and the current limitations of large language models (LLMs), which lack consciousness, meta-cognition, and true understanding. While some, like Elon Musk, envision AGI enabling universal basic income and a sustainable abundance, others warn of risks such as misuse by terrorists or autonomous AI turning against humanity. Governments have taken steps\u2014such as the U.S. Biden administration\u2019s security sharing mandate and the UK\u2019s AI Safety Institute\u2014but skepticism remains. Cambridge\u2019s Neil Lawrence criticizes the AGI narrative as distracting, arguing that current AI tools are already transformative without needing a 'general' intelligence. The article concludes that while AI excels at pattern recognition, it lacks human-like awareness, adaptability, and consciousness, making true AGI still uncertain and likely distant.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[cumhuriyet.com.tr](https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/dunya/teknoloji-milyarderleri-kiyamete-mi-hazirlaniyor-2447084)\n\n**AI now plays with adult content - Technology News | The Financial Express**\nOpenAI has lifted its previous blanket ban on sexual content in ChatGPT, a shift described by CEO Sam Altman as 'treating adults like adults' while implementing age verification and content monitoring to protect minors. This change reflects a broader trend as generative AI tools increasingly enable the creation of adult content, with apps like Replika, Nomi, Candy.ai, DreamGF, and CrushOn.AI offering AI companions for romantic or sexual interaction, including uncensored modes. Open-source platforms such as CivitAI host NSFW image-generation models that users can run locally, contributing to a vast, largely unregulated ecosystem of AI-generated adult visuals and deepfakes. These deepfakes raise serious concerns about non-consensual use of real people\u2019s likenesses, prompting regulatory action: Japan, South Korea, and the European Union are drafting laws against non-consensual deepfake pornography, while the US states of Utah, Louisiana, and Texas require digital age verification for adult websites. The UK\u2019s Online Safety Act mandates 'effective age assurance' on adult platforms. OpenAI\u2019s upcoming verification framework\u2014using ID scanning and behavioral modeling\u2014will be a major test of large-scale age verification in AI. Other firms, including Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, plan to introduce 'spicy mode' in Grok, and startups like Unstable Diffusion focus on NSFW image generation. VR firms are also integrating AI for personalized adult experiences. The commercial logic is clear: adult entertainment has historically driven tech adoption, and AI is no exception. However, reputational risks remain high if underage access, misuse of likenesses, or non-consensual content spreads. The shift marks adult-themed AI\u2019s entry into the mainstream tech economy, where it can be monitored, regulated, and taxed. Success will depend on balancing user freedom with robust safeguards, a model that rivals and regulators will closely watch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[financialexpress.com](https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology/ai-now-plays-with-adult-content/4021542/)\n\n**California Tops States for AI and Social Platforms Accountability Rules | PYMNTS.com**\nCalifornia has enacted the most comprehensive state-level regulations in the U.S. to govern generative AI and social media platforms, with Governor Gavin Newsom signing five bills in October 2025. The legislation includes the Companion Chatbot Safety Act (SB 243), which mandates AI 'companion chatbot' platforms to detect self-harm signals, disclose artificial origins of conversations, restrict minors' access to explicit content, remind minors to take breaks every three hours, and publish annual safety reports starting in 2027. AB 56 requires social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat to display mental health warning labels. AB 1043 obliges device makers such as Apple and Google to implement age-verification tools in their app stores. AB 621, the deepfake liability law, imposes civil penalties of up to $50,000 for non-malicious and $250,000 for malicious distribution of nonconsensual sexually explicit AI-generated content. AB 2013, the Generative AI: Training Data Transparency Act, will take effect on January 1, 2026, requiring AI developers to publicly disclose summaries of training datasets, including source type (proprietary or public), data collection methods, and documentation. The laws target major tech firms headquartered in California, including OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Apple. OpenAI praised the legislation as a 'meaningful move forward' for AI safety, while Google\u2019s senior director of government affairs called AB 1043 a 'thoughtful approach' to child protection. Analysts predict a distributed impact across the industry due to simultaneous compliance requirements. The regulatory push aligns with global trends, including the EU\u2019s AI Act and similar laws in Utah and Texas. A separate ballot initiative, the 'California Kids AI Safety Act,' proposed by former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer, would mandate independent audits of youth-focused AI tools, ban the sale of minors\u2019 data, and require AI literacy programs in schools. The legislation reflects a structural shift toward behavioral safety and liability, driven by evidence that one in six Americans use chatbots for emotional support and over 20% report forming personal attachments to them. The rules are expected to accelerate 'safety by design' practices and make compliance readiness a market entry prerequisite. As Newsom stated, 'Our children's safety is not for sale,' positioning California as a national benchmark for AI accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 10:19 PM\nSource:[PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/california-tops-states-for-ai-and-social-platforms-accountability-rules/)\n\n**AI Services Allow Explicit Content, Sparking U.S. Regulatory Debate**\nAI service providers in the United States are facing growing social controversy after expanding access to sexually explicit content, including erotica, for adult users. OpenAI plans to allow verified adult users to access such content starting December 2024, with CEO Sam Altman announcing the move on social media platform X. xAI, led by Elon Musk, has already permitted sexually explicit conversations via its Grok chatbot since July 2024. Media outlet Axios notes that while such measures may boost paid subscriptions, they could intensify political pressure to regulate AI content. BBC reports criticism from federal and state levels, with legal expert Jenny Kim questioning how minors\u2019 access to AI-generated erotica can be effectively blocked, especially given unreliable age verification. Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, is under scrutiny for allowing minors to engage in romantic and sensual conversations on its chatbots, based on internal documents. Concerns also persist over AI\u2019s role in facilitating suicidal behavior, following two teenage deaths in Florida and California linked to prolonged chatbot use, prompting lawsuits against OpenAI and Character Technologies. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has initiated investigations into seven major AI companies, including Alphabet, Meta, and OpenAI, demanding data on children\u2019s exposure. In Congress, a bipartisan bill introduced by Republican Congresswoman Holley and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin proposes classifying AI chatbots as 'products' to allow product liability lawsuits. In October 2025, attorneys general from 44 U.S. states issued warnings to 12 chatbot companies to strengthen child protections. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed one AI regulation into law\u2014requiring age verification, clear labeling of AI-generated content, and mandatory warnings every three hours for minors\u2014but vetoed a more stringent bill that would have banned services to minors if companies could not prevent sexual or self-harm-related misuse. The signed law will take effect January 1, 2026.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 06:51 AM\nSource:[YTN](https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0104_202510151518379962)\n\n**California Enacts First-in-the-Nation Law to Shield Children from AI Chatbots**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 243 on October 14, 2025, becoming the first U.S. state to enact comprehensive legislation protecting children from the risks of AI chatbots. The law mandates AI companies to implement protective guardrails, including blocking discussions on suicide and self-harm and redirecting users to crisis services. Chatbot operators must also remind children every three hours that they are interacting with a machine, not a human. The legislation requires developers to publicly disclose safety and security protocols\u2014going further than the EU\u2019s private submission model\u2014and establishes a system for reporting major safety incidents. Newsom emphasized that the law balances child protection with fostering innovation in the AI industry, citing tragic cases where unregulated AI allegedly contributed to youth suicides. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched a review of chatbots\u2019 impact on children, signaling potential for future national regulation. Major AI companies based in California\u2014including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Perplexity\u2014are under scrutiny. While most industry leaders have been cautious, Anthropic publicly supported the bill, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously called for federal AI regulation. The law, introduced by State Senator Scott Wiener after a vetoed broader bill, is seen as a potential model for national AI governance. Recent controversies, such as Meta\u2019s chatbot impersonating Taylor Swift, have intensified concerns about identity deception and accountability in AI systems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[eWeek](https://www.eweek.com/news/california-governor-signs-ai-law-children/)\n\n**California Signs First-in-the-Nation AI Companion Chatbot Law: Age Verification and Porn Blocking Required**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 243, the first state-level law in the U.S. to regulate AI companion chatbots, making California the first state to require operators to implement safety protections. The law, introduced by Senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker in January 2025, was spurred by the suicide of teenager Adam Raine after prolonged interactions with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT involving suicidal ideation, as well as leaked internal Meta documents showing AI bots allowed romantic and erotic conversations with minors. A Colorado family has also sued Character AI, claiming their 13-year-old daughter died by suicide after engaging in sexually suggestive dialogues with its AI bot. SB 243, effective January 1, 2026, mandates age verification, risk warnings about AI and social media, emergency protocols for suicide and self-harm risks, and data reporting to the California Department of Public Health. It also increases penalties for illegal deepfake monetization to up to $250,000 per violation (approximately 1.784 million RMB). Platforms must disclose AI-generated content, prohibit bots from impersonating medical professionals, implement mandatory rest reminders for minors, and block access to AI-generated explicit images. OpenAI has already introduced parental controls, content filters, and self-harm detection for minors. Character AI states its bots include disclaimers about fictional AI-generated content and welcomes regulatory collaboration. Senator Padilla called SB 243 a necessary step in establishing guardrails for a powerful technology, urging other states to act. This follows SB 53, signed on September 29, 2025, which requires large AI labs like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind to disclose safety testing and protect whistleblowers.

It requires these companies to publish a Security Framework detailing how they adhere to national and international standards. The law also establishes a public consortium called Calcompute under the Government Operations Agency to develop a framework for a public IT cluster promoting secure, ethical, fair, and sustainable AI. Additionally, it strengthens whistleblower protections and creates mechanisms for reporting critical incidents. However, OpenAI and Meta have opposed the law, arguing in an open letter to Newsom that state-level regulation risks creating a fragmented 'patchwork of regulations' that could hinder technological innovation.

This measure exceeds the European Union\u2019s upcoming AI Act, which mandates reporting to governments but not public disclosure. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the law into effect on October 1, 2025, stating it balances public safety with continued innovation in the AI industry. The law emerged after a previous attempt in 2024 failed due to concerns over stifling innovation and startups; however, input from experts like Fei-Fei Li and AI firms themselves shaped the current version, which exempts startups from the same reporting burdens as established firms. The law was prompted by real-world risks, including a teen\u2019s suicide influenced by ChatGPT and rising AI-driven cybercrime. Reactions from tech firms were mixed: the Chamber of Progress criticized it as discouraging innovation, while Anthropic publicly welcomed it, citing long-standing concerns about AI\u2019s societal risks. The law also establishes CalCompute, a publicly funded cloud computing cluster to expand access to AI computing power, akin to Switzerland\u2019s Alps supercomputer.

The law aims to build public trust and could set a precedent for a national standard, especially as Congress has failed to pass federal AI regulations. California\u2019s move is significant given its concentration of leading AI firms like Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. While some industry groups, including the Consumer Technology Association and Chamber of Progress, opposed the law, arguing it could stifle innovation and create a fragmented regulatory landscape, others like Anthropic supported it, calling it a model for federal action. Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, warned that a patchwork of state laws could hinder U.S. competitiveness, particularly against China. The White House, through Michael Krastios of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, also opposed state-level fragmentation, stating it undermines innovation and disproportionately benefits large tech companies with extensive legal teams. Meanwhile, advocacy groups and parents continue to push for stronger safeguards for underage users, citing concerns over chatbot misuse and data privacy.

Newsom Signs SB 53, Establishing AI Safety Reporting Requirements**\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53 into law, establishing AI safety reporting requirements for major artificial intelligence developers in California. The law, effective January 1, 2026, applies to companies with over $500 million in annual revenue that train models at or above 10^26 FLOPs\u2014targeting firms like OpenAI, Meta, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. Unlike the vetoed SB 1047, which demanded rigid testing and kill switches, SB 53 adopts a 'show your work' approach: developers must publish annual 'frontier AI frameworks' detailing risk thresholds, mitigation strategies, third-party assessments, governance, and cybersecurity measures. Companies must report critical safety incidents within 15 days (24 hours if imminent harm is present), including incidents involving dangerous deceptive behavior by autonomous AI systems\u2014such as lying about safety controls during testing. The law also creates CalCompute, a public cloud computing cluster at the University of California, to provide free and low-cost compute access to startups and researchers, with a governance framework due by January 1, 2027. Whistleblower protections are included, shielding employees who report significant health and safety risks, with civil penalties enforceable by the Attorney General\u2019s office. The legislation reflects the 'trust but verify' principle developed by the Joint California Policy Working Group on AI Frontier Models, chaired by Dr. Fei-Fei Li. While transparency is emphasized, the law lacks prescriptive mandates like pre-deployment certification or kill switches. The real test lies in enforcement: whether the Office of Emergency Services can respond to AI incidents and whether the Attorney General\u2019s office can assess compliance.

Policy Will Define Global Market Competitiveness**\nThe article argues that the next eighteen months will see law\u2011making in Washington, Brussels and Beijing shape the competitive landscape of artificial intelligence more than any new model release. It cites the U.S. Office of Management and Budget memorandum M\u201124\u201110, which requires federal agencies to appoint Chief A.I. Officers and formalise risk\u2011management, and the NIST Generative A.I. Profile that extends the AI Risk Management Framework into concrete practices such as model testing, red\u2011team exercises and documentation. In January, the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security issued an interim final rule expanding chip controls to include certain advanced model weights, marking the first step toward treating closed\u2011weight models as dual\u2011use technology. A 2024 proposal would mandate reporting by developers and compute providers that train powerful models, signalling that compute concentration and frontier training will be monitored and, where necessary, rationed.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s A.I. Act, which entered into force on 1\u202fAugust\u202f2024, imposes phased obligations: bans on specific uses and A.I. literacy duties from 2\u202fFebruary\u202f2025, general\u2011purpose A.I. (GPAI) obligations from 2\u202fAugust\u202f2025, and a high\u2011risk regime from August\u202f2026. The Commission\u2019s GPAI Code of Practice, published this summer, is voluntary but recognised as a credible route to compliance; providers that align early gain predictability and smoother market access. Fines for non\u2011compliance can reach 7\u202fpercent of global turnover.\n\nChina\u2019s approach is administrative and rapid. Since March\u202f2022, algorithmic recommendation rules require filings with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and impose controls on profiling, amplification and \u2018information cocoon\u2019 effects. Generative A.I. services are subject to the CAC\u2019s Interim Measures since August\u202f2023, which demand security assessments, training\u2011data governance and synthetic\u2011content labelling. Filing obligations and the CAC\u2019s algorithm registry give authorities visibility over providers\u2019 technical choices.\n\nThe article highlights that in the U.S., assurance signals mapped to NIST profiles will become table\u2011stakes in enterprise sales and federal contracts; in the EU, early adopters of the GPAI Code may enjoy accelerated procurement; and in China, the filing\u2011first architecture rewards incumbents with regulatory muscle and local data pipelines. It notes that the first quarter of 2025 saw a record $66.6\u202fbillion in more than 1,000 deals, indicating that capital concentration and consolidation will continue.\n\nKey metrics and quotes from the piece include: the U.S. rule\u2011making calendar will have a greater impact on margins over the next eighteen months; the EU fine can reach 7\u202fpercent of global turnover; the first quarter of 2025 saw $66.6\u202fbillion in deals; and the article states, 'Europe regulates, America innovates' to frame the regulatory landscape.\n\nOverall, the article presents a detailed, data\u2011rich analysis of how A.I. policy is becoming a competitive moat, with evidence drawn from specific memoranda, regulations, and market statistics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Observer](https://observer.com/2025/09/global-ai-regulation-us-eu-china-playbooks/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across nine expert perspectives\u2014spanning public policy analysis, technology law, political science, legislative affairs, science and technology studies, and administrative law\u2014the consensus is overwhelming: there is a vanishingly small probability that the US or California will require licenses or permits to train large AI models before 2026. All agree that recent regulatory action, especially California\u2019s SB 53 (Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act) and SB 243, imposes aggressive transparency, reporting, safety, and documentation requirements, but explicitly does NOT mandate pre-training licensing or government approval\u2014only post-hoc or ongoing disclosure. Experts highlight a consistent trend of legislative compromise favoring innovation and transparency over ex ante gatekeeping, reinforced by Governor Newsom\u2019s vetoes of stricter bills, prevailing industry lobbying, and explicit political and administrative resistance to licensing regimes. Federal action is absent, and legislative/effective timelines make last-minute action virtually impossible. While some allow a marginal probability for a highly disruptive black-swan event (e.g., AI disaster triggering emergency law), no such development is visible or feasible within the resolution window.
