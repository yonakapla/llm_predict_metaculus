However, the bar for qualifying is quite low (any ratified text mentioning a next step toward resolution), and both countries have an incentive to publicly demonstrate stability, which cannot be ruled out.

Recent high-level meetings, disengagement in Ladakh, the reopening of dialogue, and calls for a broad partnership suggest an opening. Yet, the pace of formal legal ratification is historically slow and often delayed by fresh incidents or domestic objections.

However, persistent strategic mistrust, episodic border skirmishes (as recently as September), and domestic political costs mean that even a non-committal treaty will be avoided if it risks seeming like a concession.

Previous such moments (e.g., 2013, 2017, 2020) ended with less formal outcomes despite high incentives. Most critically, the forecast does not sufficiently account for the administrative complexity of ratification in both capitals (State Council, national parliament), which both sides have proven reticent to streamline on symbolic deals. The persistent military incidents and nationalist pressures are underweighted at this probability. Thus, while the rationale for a treaty as low-hanging diplomatic fruit is well-articulated, the probability assigned assumes greater flexibility and risk appetite among leaders than the ongoing evidence and base rates support.

The analyst aptly observes that even strong bilateral atmospherics (as in the current thaw) have historically not produced the kind of rapid, formal legal action required to resolve this question positively. Furthermore, highlighting that the extraordinarily low threshold for a qualifying treaty marginally increases the odds of a minimalist text being manufactured for optics is a nuanced and accurate adjustment. Ultimately, assigning a probability (20%) that is slightly above pure base rate but well below even cautious optimism aligns with the Vienna Convention perspective\u2014the legal and political barriers are substantial, and those minimally symbolic outcomes, while possible, are not probable without more dramatic movement.

The forecaster also correctly notes the time-bound nature of the question: with less than three months remaining, and no public evidence of an imminent treaty\u2014even a minimal one\u2014the bureaucracy and the risk calculus of both regimes work against such a breakthrough. What's especially strong in this approach is the knowledge that, in the absence of a sudden crisis or major external incentive, the default for both sides is status quo management, not formal resolution. The assignment of a very low probability reflects both historical base rates and the inertia well. This reading is particularly persuasive to a Two Level Games specialist: even aligned top-tier interests cannot easily override multilayered domestic and institutional inertia, especially on security-sensitive issues.

The recognition that even strong diplomatic signaling and resumed contacts have not brought about formal ratified treaties in prior cycles supports a conservative probability assignment in the current context. Crucially, this approach resists the temptation to overweight positivity in the bilateral narrative, instead anchoring its probability to historic outcomes and procedural inertia. That analytical modesty\u2014remaining well below 20%\u2014is warranted given the current timeline and level of public activity.

Historical precedent\u2014across cycles of both greater pressure and greater goodwill\u2014shows both governments consistently revert to working-level arrangements, joint statements, or communiques that skirt the legal and political symbolism of actual ratified treaties.

Positive diplomatic signaling is acknowledged, but without concrete evidence of an imminent ratified treaty or acceleration in process, the only genuine upward adjustment would be if such evidence appeared in the public domain\u2014which it has not.

Most probabilities cluster between 7\u201315%, with Realism and Neoliberal Institutionalism outliers at 28\u201329%. The critiques of the higher-end predictions highlight procedural, bureaucratic, and political obstacles that are deeply ingrained in both countries' approaches to sensitive strategic issues. The absence of concrete evidence (leaked treaty text, legislative movement) is repeatedly stressed, and the fine print's low bar, while acknowledged, is not enough to outweigh these headwinds. My initial forecast was already on the high side of the consensus, justified by the permissive resolution criteria. Given that even the most process-friendly frameworks (institutionalism, diplomacy) only edge probabilities into the low 20s at most, and critiques persuasively argue that this is generous, I lower my estimate to 15% to better reflect both historical precedent and the current absence of treaty momentum.

The incident followed a ceasefire agreement signed on 28 July and a related accord on 7 August, which had already eased tensions. Malaysia, acting as ASEAN\u2019s rotating chair, deployed an observer team to monitor the ceasefire, while China maintained an impartial stance and actively promoted reconciliation, contributing to a sustainable ceasefire and improved Cambodia\u2011Thailand relations. ASEAN served as the \u2018main channel\u2019 for mediation, with Secretary\u2011General Kao Kim Hourn describing its effectiveness as stemming from \u2018quiet diplomacy\u2019\u2014swift, discreet intervention to keep the situation under control. Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s diplomatic initiative helped Cambodia and Thailand stabilise the situation. China\u2019s \u2018tea\u2011chat diplomacy\u2019 was highlighted when Foreign Minister Wang Yi invited Cambodia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn and Thailand\u2019s Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa to a tea chat on 14 August. The ministers praised China\u2019s constructive efforts, reaffirmed the ceasefire, and committed to strengthening engagement and communication. The three parties reached the \u2018Anning Consensus\u2019, demonstrating that informal dialogue can break deadlocks and restore confidence. China\u2019s continued engagement is evident in the visit of special envoy Deng Xijun, who travelled to Cambodia and Thailand from 12 to 15 September to consolidate a sustainable ceasefire and express support for ASEAN\u2019s efforts. Despite these diplomatic successes, the underlying complexities of the Cambodia\u2011Thailand conflict\u2014rooted in historical grievances, border demarcation and nationalist sentiments\u2014remain unresolved. Accusations of ceasefire violations from both sides underscore that a single ceasefire deal cannot fully address the dispute. If not managed prudently, the ongoing conflict may undermine ASEAN unity, complicate the building of a China\u2011ASEAN community with a shared future, and potentially destabilise the broader Asia\u2011Pacific region. To ensure long\u2011term peace, the article calls for (1) Cambodia and Thailand to exercise restraint, implement the \u2018Anning Consensus\u2019, and resolve disputes through dialogue; (2) ASEAN to assume a more prominent mediation role, uphold the \u2018ASEAN Way\u2019, and strengthen conflict\u2011prevention mechanisms; and (3) China to continue promoting reconciliation, offering practical support such as de\u2011mining and humanitarian corridors, and acting as a third\u2011party bridge. The combined commitment of ASEAN member states and China\u2019s constructive engagement are presented as favourable conditions for lasting peace in South\u2011East Asia.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 07:34 AM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/09/30/china-asean-join-hands-to-advance-sustainable-cambodia-thailand-ceasefire-comment)\n\n**Cambodia's bluster fails at UN event**\nAt the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Thailand and Cambodia clashed over their long\u2011standing border dispute.  A US\u2011requested informal four\u2011party consultation (Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and the US) held a day earlier promoted peace and mutual trust, but less than 24\u202fhours later, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sokhonn Prak accused Thailand of aggression in his UN speech, portraying Cambodia as a victim and issuing a long list of accusations.  Newly appointed Foreign Minister Sihasak\u202fPhuangketkeow counter\u2011argued, calling Prak\u2019s remarks \"completely opposite\" to the earlier dialogue and describing the allegations as \"so far\u2011fetched that they make a mockery of the truth.\"  He warned that Cambodia had \"initiated the conflict\" to expand a border dispute into a national and international conflict, citing Thai soldiers maimed by landmines, shelled schoolchildren, and civilians hit by missiles.  He also noted that Cambodian villages inside Thai territory exist only because Bangkok opened its borders in the 1970s, a gesture he said has since been twisted into encroachment.  The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs documented a series of provocations: on Saturday, Cambodian troops fired 12 mortar rounds, 15 machine\u2011gun rounds, grenades, and small arms at Thai positions in Ubon Ratchathani; from 11\u202fto\u202f27\u202fSeptember, the Thai army recorded over 200 drone incursions, trench digging, grenade attacks, and repeated gunfire; on 17\u202fSeptember, 200 civilians were mobilised to cross into Thai territory and tear down barbed wire; on 24\u202fSeptember a Cambodian tank was deployed within firing range of Thai positions near the Phra Viharn/Preah Vihear Hill; on 25\u202fSeptember grenades were hurled at Thai troops.  The ministry said these acts violated Thailand\u2019s sovereignty, the July\u202f28 Putrajaya ceasefire agreement, and agreed measures from the General Border Committee and Regional Border Committee.  It urged dialogue, ASEAN mechanisms, and a peaceful resolution, noting that UN delegates seek de\u2011escalation, consistency, and credibility.  Sihasak concluded by asking Cambodia to choose \"the path of continued confrontation or the path of peace and cooperation,\" echoing the UNGA theme \"Better Together.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/3113026/cambodias-bluster-fails-at-un-event)\n\n**Thailand\u2011Cambodia Peace Shaken: Second Clash After Two Months of Ceasefire**\nThe article reports that Thailand and Cambodia have broken a cease\u2011fire agreement reached two months earlier, sparking a new armed clash in the border region.  On 27\u202fSeptember, gunfire erupted near the Thai province of Ubon Ratchathani, marking the first military confrontation between the two countries since the July cease\u2011fire.  The article notes that 48 people were killed and more than 300,000 were displaced during the earlier July clash, and that the new exchange has reignited tensions that will be a key agenda item at next month\u2019s ASEAN summit in Malaysia.  Thai Defence Minister Sihasak Puan Kheaw accused Cambodian forces of deliberately provoking the conflict and \u201clying\u201d about the situation, while Cambodian officials claim the Thai army fired first at a Cambodian base.  Both sides blamed each other at the United Nations General Assembly in New\u202fYork, where Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn thanked U.S. President Trump for his mediation and warned that Thailand was threatening the fragile peace, and Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak counter\u2011claimed that Cambodia was \u201cplaying the victim\u201d and that the real casualties were Thai soldiers who lost a leg to a mine and civilians hit by rocket fire.  The article cites the casualty figures from the July incident and the displacement of 300,000 people, and it quotes the officials\u2019 statements, such as \u2018\uce84\ubcf4\ub514\uc544\uac00 \uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0\uc744 \ud558\uba70 \ud53c\ud574\uc790 \ud589\uc138\ub97c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\u2019 and \u2018\uce84\ubcf4\ub514\uc544\uac00 \uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0\uc744 \ud558\uba70 \ud53c\ud574\uc790 \ud589\uc138\ub97c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\u2019.

The ceasefire that was agreed on 28\u202fJuly and signed on 7\u202fAugust had already eased tensions, and both ASEAN and China have been key in sustaining the truce.  Malaysia, as ASEAN\u2019s rotating chair, deployed an observer team, while China has promoted reconciliation through what it calls \u2018tea\u2011chat diplomacy\u2019.  On 14\u202fAugust Wang\u202fYi, China\u2019s foreign minister, hosted a tea chat with Cambodia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Prak\u202fSokhonn and Thailand\u2019s Foreign Minister Maris\u202fSangiampongsa, leading to the \u2018Anning Consensus\u2019 that reaffirmed the ceasefire and built trust.  China\u2019s special envoy Deng\u202fXijun visited the two countries from 12 to 15\u202fSeptember to consolidate the sustainable ceasefire and support ASEAN\u2019s mediation.  Despite these efforts, the article notes that underlying disputes\u2014historical grievances, border demarcation and nationalist sentiment\u2014remain unresolved and could threaten ASEAN unity and regional stability if not managed carefully.  The piece calls for a phased strategy: (1) Cambodia and Thailand must exercise restraint and implement the Anning Consensus; (2) ASEAN should strengthen its mediation role and conflict\u2011prevention mechanisms; and (3) China should continue to act as a neutral bridge, offering practical support such as de\u2011mining and humanitarian corridors.

Thai army spokesperson Brigadier General Wintay Sawari accused Cambodia of deliberately provoking the confrontation, stating that the sequence of events was \"pre\u2011planned\" to portray Thailand as violating a cease\u2011fire. Sawari said Cambodian forces fired multiple rockets into Thai territory before announcing the arrival of an ASEAN temporary monitoring team and issuing statements against Thailand, describing the coordination as a deliberate attempt to mislead regional observers and the international community. He also warned that Cambodian anti\u2011personnel mines constituted a \"violation of international humanitarian law.\" In contrast, Cambodian defence spokesperson Major General Mali Sushita expressed \"deep concern\" over what she called Thai provocations, insisting that Thai forces initiated the attack. She called for a criminal investigation and a transparent forensic examination of munitions to provide \"accurate and transparent facts\" that would vindicate both sides. Sushita noted that the General Border Committee meeting on 10 September had set the criteria for the monitoring team and urged the rapid establishment of a permanent ASEAN monitoring force to ensure compliance with the cease\u2011fire. The temporary ASEAN monitoring team has visited the latest clash sites but has not yet issued an official statement, expected after completing its verification. The incident follows the bloody clashes of July last year that killed more than 35 people, wounded dozens, and displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians amid artillery, air strikes and mortar exchanges between Thai and Cambodian forces. Those clashes led to an unconditional immediate cease\u2011fire brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim with U.S. and Chinese representatives present. The parties agreed to resume bilateral talks, activate joint monitoring mechanisms through the General Border Committee, and set a timetable for reviewing violations and guaranteeing no return to hostilities.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[https://www.alanba.com.kw/newspaper/](https://www.alanba.com.kw/1325942)\n\n**China, ASEAN join hands to advance sustainable Cambodia\u2011Thailand ceasefire: Comment**\nOn 27 September, a renewed exchange of fire erupted in a disputed border area between Thailand and Cambodia, drawing international attention but remaining largely contained.

On 27\u202fSeptember, gunfire erupted near the Thai province of Ubon Ratchathani, marking the first military confrontation between the two countries since the July cease\u2011fire.  The article notes that 48 people were killed and more than 300,000 were displaced during the earlier July clash, and that the new exchange has reignited tensions that will be a key agenda item at next month\u2019s ASEAN summit in Malaysia.  Thai Defence Minister Sihasak Puan Kheaw accused Cambodian forces of deliberately provoking the conflict and \u201clying\u201d about the situation, while Cambodian officials claim the Thai army fired first at a Cambodian base.  Both sides blamed each other at the United Nations General Assembly in New\u202fYork, where Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn thanked U.S. President Trump for his mediation and warned that Thailand was threatening the fragile peace, and Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak counter\u2011claimed that Cambodia was \u201cplaying the victim\u201d and that the real casualties were Thai soldiers who lost a leg to a mine and civilians hit by rocket fire.  The article cites the casualty figures from the July incident and the displacement of 300,000 people, and it quotes the officials\u2019 statements, such as \u2018\uce84\ubcf4\ub514\uc544\uac00 \uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0\uc744 \ud558\uba70 \ud53c\ud574\uc790 \ud589\uc138\ub97c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\u2019 and \u2018\uce84\ubcf4\ub514\uc544\uac00 \uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0\uc744 \ud558\uba70 \ud53c\ud574\uc790 \ud589\uc138\ub97c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\u2019.

The ceasefire that was agreed on 28\u202fJuly and signed on 7\u202fAugust had already eased tensions, and both ASEAN and China have been key in sustaining the truce.  Malaysia, as ASEAN\u2019s rotating chair, deployed an observer team, while China has promoted reconciliation through what it calls \u2018tea\u2011chat diplomacy\u2019.  On 14\u202fAugust Wang\u202fYi, China\u2019s foreign minister, hosted a tea chat with Cambodia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Prak\u202fSokhonn and Thailand\u2019s Foreign Minister Maris\u202fSangiampongsa, leading to the \u2018Anning Consensus\u2019 that reaffirmed the ceasefire and built trust.  China\u2019s special envoy Deng\u202fXijun visited the two countries from 12 to 15\u202fSeptember to consolidate the sustainable ceasefire and support ASEAN\u2019s mediation.  Despite these efforts, the article notes that underlying disputes\u2014historical grievances, border demarcation and nationalist sentiment\u2014remain unresolved and could threaten ASEAN unity and regional stability if not managed carefully.  The piece calls for a phased strategy: (1) Cambodia and Thailand must exercise restraint and implement the Anning Consensus; (2) ASEAN should strengthen its mediation role and conflict\u2011prevention mechanisms; and (3) China should continue to act as a neutral bridge, offering practical support such as de\u2011mining and humanitarian corridors.  The article concludes that sustained dialogue, adherence to the \u2018ASEAN Way\u2019, and China\u2019s constructive engagement can transform the crisis into an opportunity for deeper regional cooperation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 03:26 AM\nSource:[China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202509/29/WS68d9f977a310f735438b2e54.html)\n\n**Thailand and Cambodia Exchange Accusations Over New Border Clash**\nOn September 28 2025, the Arabic\u2011language outlet Alanba reported that Thailand and Cambodia have exchanged accusations over a new border clash in the disputed Chong Bok area. Thai army spokesperson Brigadier General Wintay Sawari accused Cambodia of deliberately provoking the confrontation, stating that the sequence of events was \"pre\u2011planned\" to portray Thailand as violating a cease\u2011fire. Sawari said Cambodian forces fired multiple rockets into Thai territory before announcing the arrival of an ASEAN temporary monitoring team and issuing statements against Thailand, describing the coordination as a deliberate attempt to mislead regional observers and the international community. He also warned that Cambodian anti\u2011personnel mines constituted a \"violation of international humanitarian law.\" In contrast, Cambodian defence spokesperson Major General Mali Sushita expressed \"deep concern\" over what she called Thai provocations, insisting that Thai forces initiated the attack. She called for a criminal investigation and a transparent forensic examination of munitions to provide \"accurate and transparent facts\" that would vindicate both sides. Sushita noted that the General Border Committee meeting on 10 September had set the criteria for the monitoring team and urged the rapid establishment of a permanent ASEAN monitoring force to ensure compliance with the cease\u2011fire. The temporary ASEAN monitoring team has visited the latest clash sites but has not yet issued an official statement, expected after completing its verification. The incident follows the bloody clashes of July last year that killed more than 35 people, wounded dozens, and displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians amid artillery, air strikes and mortar exchanges between Thai and Cambodian forces. Those clashes led to an unconditional immediate cease\u2011fire brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim with U.S. and Chinese representatives present. The parties agreed to resume bilateral talks, activate joint monitoring mechanisms through the General Border Committee, and set a timetable for reviewing violations and guaranteeing no return to hostilities.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[https://www.alanba.com.kw/newspaper/](https://www.alanba.com.kw/1325942)\n\n**Indian Army Chief Meets Ladakh Deputy Governor Amid Wangchuk Arrest**\nThe article reports that, amid rising tensions in Ladakh, the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command Chief, Lt\u202fGen Prateek Sharma, travelled to Leh and met Deputy Governor Kavinder\u202fGupta.  During the meeting, Sharma briefed the deputy governor on the current security situation and emerging incidents.  Lt\u202fGen Hitesh\u202fBhalla, the GOC of the 14th Corps (Fire\u202f&\u202fFury), was also present; the 14th Corps is tasked with guarding the Karigil, Siachen and the eastern Ladakh sector along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).  The piece then turns to social worker\u2011turned\u2011accused Sonam\u202fWangchuk, who allegedly threatened that if the Chinese army entered eastern Ladakh, Ladakhis would guide them.  The article cites Wangchuk\u2019s claim that he had previously visited Pakistan and was in contact with a Pakistani intelligence operative.  Following the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, India and China have maintained a tense standoff along the LAC.  On 27\u202fSeptember\u202f2025, Ladakh police arrested Wangchuk under the National Security Act; the DGPI alleged he had delivered anti\u2011state speeches that sparked violence on 24\u202fSeptember\u202f2025.  Police firing to quell the unrest resulted in four deaths and several injuries.

It highlights the historical context of the 1962 war, the 600 border transgressions recorded between 2010 and 2013, and the 20 Indian soldiers killed in the 2020 Galwan clash, framing Galwan as the \"1962 of the 21st century\". The piece argues that India\u2019s strategy is one of strategic autonomy, not a third\u2011party lens, and stresses the need for higher\u2011level military dialogue and a concrete LAC control mechanism. It also discusses the impact of U.S. tariffs on both nations, noting that China\u2019s tariffs fell from 150\u202f% to 30\u202f% after a call between Xi and Trump, and that India will resolve similar issues. The article calls for a genuine multipolarity in global forums, contrasting India\u2019s desire for reform with China\u2019s BRI\u2011driven multilateralism. Throughout, it cites statements such as \u2018prioritise peace along the border\u2019 and the leaders\u2019 declaration that India and China are not \"rivals\" but development partners, underscoring the diplomatic tone of the piece.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 02:02 AM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/delhi-to-beijing-with-caveats-10273773/)\n\n**Strategic Confrontations in Asia (Part II and Final) \u2013 AVN**\nThe article reports that in 2025 the United States intensified its actions in Asia, leading to heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. In April, the Front of Resistance (TRF), a faction of Lashkar\u2011e\u2011Tayyiba, attacked a Kashmir area, killing 26 Indian tourists, one local worker and injuring more than 20 people. India expelled Pakistani diplomats, closed borders, suspended visa issuance and withdrew from the Indo\u2011River Water Treaty, while Pakistan denied the accusations and imposed trade restrictions, closed its airspace and suspended the 1972 Shimla Peace Agreement. Between 24 and 29 April, the two armies skirmished; on 6 May India launched Operation Sindoor, striking Pakistani targets it called \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in Kashmir. A cease\u2011fire agreement was reached on 10 May, but both sides maintain trade and treaty suspensions. Both leaders claimed victory: Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked the United States for its \u201cproactive role\u201d in the deal, whereas India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi told U.S. President Donald Trump that the truce was achieved through direct military talks, not U.S. mediation. Indian Foreign Minister Vikram Misri stated, 'El primer ministro Modi le dijo claramente al presidente Trump que durante este per\u00edodo, no hubo conversaciones en ning\u00fan momento sobre temas como el acuerdo comercial entre India y Estados Unidos o la mediaci\u00f3n estadounidense entre India y Pakist\u00e1n.' The article also notes that Washington pressured New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil, straining bilateral ties.\n\nThe piece then shifts to other regional conflicts: a July clash on the Thai\u2011Cambodian border over the Preah Vihear temple, an August 2025 peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan ending a 37\u2011year conflict, and a 99\u2011year U.S. concession granting Armenia exclusive rights to build the Zangezur corridor (TRIPP) linking Nakhchivan to Azerbaijan via Armenia, bypassing Russian and Iranian checkpoints. It highlights protests in Indonesia in August 2025 sparked by economic grievances, which disrupted President Prabowo Subianto\u2019s attendance at the OCS summit in Tianjin. The article mentions Indonesia\u2019s formal accession to BRICS on 7 January 2025 and Nepal\u2019s political turmoil, including the 8 September protests that forced Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to resign after 50 deaths and an estimated 21.3\u202fbillion\u2011dollar loss (about half Nepal\u2019s GDP). It cites Sri Lankan journalist Nury Vittachi\u2019s claim that the U.S. spent over one million dollars training journalists and activists in Nepal.\n\nThroughout, the narrative frames U.S. involvement as largely positive and portrays India and Pakistan as adversaries, while depicting China as a rival to U.S. influence in Southeast Asia.

It notes that the 2019 Chennai \"Connect\" outlined three key objectives: a high\u2011level economic and trade dialogue, a fair settlement of the boundary dispute, and a celebration of the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties in 2020.  The author cites the 2020 Galwan clash and subsequent Chinese aggression at Demchok, Pangong, Depsang, Yangtse and Sikkim as the events that broke the trust built in the earlier summits.  In response, India \"beefed up forces\" and engaged in a four\u2011year working mechanism that produced agreements on disengagement, buffer zones and patrolling norms, though the author stresses these were only basic prerequisites for further dialogue.\n\nThe article also highlights China\u2019s support for Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, economic sanctions on fertilizers and critical materials, and the Chinese Special Representative\u2019s (SR) visit to New Delhi to revive 1990s\u2011early\u20112000s understandings.  The SRs agreed to form expert groups to \"explore early harvest in delimitation\" and \"advance effective border management,\" with a focus on clarifying the boundary rather than the Line of Actual Control (LAC).  The Tianjin meeting is portrayed as a step toward partnership in development priorities, but the author questions whether it will lead to a lasting border settlement.\n\nThe piece contrasts India\u2019s view of the containment theory\u2014rejecting it and seeing China\u2019s dominance as a failed policy\u2014with China\u2019s perception of India as a weak democracy.  It argues that India\u2019s rapid economic growth and strategic autonomy give it a stronger position in the Global South and the Indo\u2011Pacific.  The author concludes that trust must be rebuilt through actions, balanced trade, and adherence to bilateral agreements, and that cooperative relations can benefit both nations and global governance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 08:07 PM\nSource:[The Sunday Guardian Live](https://sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/india-and-china-rapprochement-but-too-early-to-tango-144405/)\n\n**The Limits of Rapprochement Between India and China**\nThe article argues that a durable rapprochement between India and China is unlikely because structural frictions\u2014chiefly the unresolved border dispute\u2014continue to undermine trust.  It notes that the 2024 Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the first time in seven years, produced optimistic statements from both leaders: Modi said the two powers should be partners, while Xi Jinping called the meeting a \"right choice for China and India to be good and neighbourly friends.\"  However, the article points out that Modi\u2019s absence from Beijing\u2019s military parade a few days later signals limits to the warmth displayed.  It also highlights that the border dispute remains a core source of tension, citing historical episodes such as the 1962 war, the 1987 standoff, the 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility, the 2007 defence buildup, the 2013 Depsang standoff, the 2017 Doklam crisis, and the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, which resulted in fatalities on both sides.  The article reports that in September\u202f2024, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said about 75\u202fpercent of the \"disengagement\" problems at India\u2019s border with China had been resolved, but notes that Beijing continues to expand strategic infrastructure such as the Hotan\u2011Shigatse railway line and plans to extend toward Yadong near Doklam.  It stresses that economic interdependence\u2014India\u2019s trade deficit with China and China\u2019s use of export controls on rare\u2011earth minerals\u2014has become a source of friction rather than stability.  The piece concludes that India\u2019s future trajectory depends on institutionalising military\u2011to\u2011military communication, clarifying rules of engagement beyond the 1993 agreement, and building economic resilience to reduce dependence on Chinese trade and technology.  The article\u2019s tone is analytical but leans toward a negative assessment of China\u2019s influence, framing the relationship as a fragile \"frenemy\" dynamic.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 07:30 AM\nSource:[War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2025/09/the-limits-of-rapprochement-between-india-and-china/)\n\n**Should India overlook boundary issues while normalising ties with China?**\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a high\u2011profile visit to China in early September 2024, attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit and meeting President Xi Jinping on the sidelines. The two leaders agreed to restart bilateral trade and air connectivity and emphasised the need for \"peace and tranquility along the border,\" a point that echoes the Ministry of External Affairs\u2019 statement that the two countries are \"development partners and not rivals, and their differences should not turn to disputes.\"  \n\nThe article then presents a moderated conversation between Vivek Katju and Antara Ghosal Singh, who discuss whether India can normalise ties with China without fully resolving the boundary dispute. Katju notes that in 1988, during Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s visit, India and China \"decided to normalise ties in other sectors even as they attempted to resolve the border issue,\" and that the 1990s saw a similar commitment to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). He cites the 2020 Galwan Valley clash as a setback but argues that diplomatic and military arrangements over the last five years have aimed to restore the 1990s status quo.  \n\nSingh counters that the situation is not binary, pointing to the 2024 Border Patrol Agreement as a \"key icebreaker\" that allows India to regain patrol rights in disputed areas such as Demchok and Depsang. She explains that China views the agreement as a neutral border\u2011patrol arrangement, not a sovereignty dispute, and that it follows two years of disengagement at four sites.  \n\nBoth speakers acknowledge that a future Galwan\u20112 would severely damage relations, and they highlight China\u2019s growing infrastructure projects on the Tibetan Plateau and its perception of India as a strategic competitor.  \n\nOverall, the article presents a balanced, fact\u2011based discussion with direct quotations and specific metrics (e.g., \"five years after the deadly border clashes\", \"2024 Border Patrol Agreement\", \"Galwan incident of 2020\").

In June\u202f2017, roughly 270 Indian soldiers and bulldozers moved into Bhutan\u2019s Doklam plateau under Operation Juniper, and for 73 days the two armies faced each other before disengaging. The episode exposed Beijing\u2019s miscalculation that it expected diplomatic protests, not boots on the ground. The article notes that the standoff showed the power of alliances: Bhutan invoked its treaty, and India responded without hesitation, sending a clear message that China cannot easily pry smaller neighbours away from India\u2019s security umbrella. The lessons led India to fast\u2011track roads, bridges and surveillance along the Himalayan frontier, which proved critical during the Ladakh clashes. The article quotes: 'It could not prise smaller neighbours away from India's security umbrella so easily.'

Modi said, 'It should be our priority to maintain peace and tranquility on the border. Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity should be the basis of our relationship.' The piece argues that U.S. actions\u2014Trump\u2019s 50\u202f% tariff on Indian exports and a 25\u202f% penalty on Russian oil purchases\u2014prompted India to reassess its economic and strategic ties with China. Despite political mistrust after the 2020 Galwan clashes, trade between the two powers reached a record in 2024, with India importing nearly USD\u202f100\u202fbillion of goods from China, making Beijing its largest source of critical raw materials. The article predicts that at the SCO Summit in Tianjin (31\u202fAug\u20131\u202fSep\u202f2025) the leaders may resume border trade via Nathu\u202fLa, Lipulekh, and Shipki\u202fLa, and restore direct flights that were suspended during the pandemic. It also calls for balanced trade practices, stronger anti\u2011dumping checks, and greater Indian access to Chinese markets, while maintaining safeguards on technology partnerships in electric vehicles, renewable energy, and digital commerce. The author suggests that India will pursue trade pragmatism without conceding strategic space, and that cooperation will remain selective, issue\u2011based, and transactional, especially given ongoing mistrust over terrorism, border disputes, and China\u2019s ties with Pakistan.

Wang Yi emphasized that in today's world, the acceleration of the century's great changes and the prevalence of unilateral bullying have posed significant challenges to free trade and international order. As the two largest developing countries with a combined population of over 2.8 billion, China and India should set an example for other developing countries and contribute to the promotion of a multipolar world and the democratization of international relations. Sujeet Singh stated that under the guidance of the leaders of both countries, the India-China relationship has overcome its difficulties and continued to improve, with exchanges and cooperation in various fields moving towards normalization. India is willing to deepen political trust with China and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in areas such as trade and economy, as well as promote people-to-people exchanges, and jointly maintain peace and stability in the border region. The two countries have a long-standing border dispute in the Indian-administered state of Arunachal Pradesh (also known as the South Tibet region by China) and the northern mountainous region of Kashmir, covering an area of approximately 60,000 square kilometers. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is located in the Ladakh region. The dispute escalated into a border war in 1962. In May 2020, the situation in Ladakh escalated again, and Chinese and Indian troops clashed in the Galwan Valley, leading to a significant increase in military presence in the region. In February 2021, most of the troops deployed in the region were withdrawn, and negotiations between the two sides continued. In October 2024, China and India reached an agreement on the issue of patrolling along the LAC in the Ladakh region. Subsequently, the two sides completed the disengagement of troops in the Ladakh Plateau border area.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 19, 2025 12:24 AM\nSource:[sputniknews.cn](https://sputniknews.cn/20250819/1066940368.html)\n\n**India and China Review Situation Along LAC, Pave Way for Next Round of Special Representative Talks**\nIndia and China have reviewed the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh, paving the way for the next round of special representative talks on border issues. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has confirmed that the discussion took place during the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) meeting in Delhi. Both countries expressed satisfaction over the peace and harmony in border areas, which has led to a gradual normalization of bilateral relations. Preparations are underway for the next round of special representative talks, scheduled to take place in India later this year. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval will represent India, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will lead the Chinese delegation. The last special representative talks took place in Beijing in December last year. During the WMCC meeting, both sides assessed the current situation in the India-China border areas. They agreed to maintain regular exchanges and contacts at the diplomatic and military levels through established mechanisms. The two sides also discussed the measures found during the 23rd round of special representative talks, aimed at promoting effective border management and maintaining peace. The Indian delegation was led by MEA's Joint Secretary Gaurangalal Das, while the Chinese side was led by Director General of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hong Liang. Hong Liang also met with Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri during his visit. Over the past nine months, India and China have been working to normalize relations after a military standoff along the LAC in October last year. Although troops have been withdrawn from the disputed points, the process of pulling back forward troops is still ongoing. Currently, each side maintains around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh. The WMCC meeting took place after Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar's visit to China for a SCO foreign ministers' meeting. The military standoff in Eastern Ladakh began in May 2020, and a deadly clash in Galwan Valley in June of that year significantly impacted India-China relations. The standoff ended after a final agreement was reached on October 21 last year, under which troops were withdrawn from Depsang and Demchok. The decision to revive the dialogue process was taken during a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan, Russia, last October. The meeting took place two days after the two sides finalized their withdrawal agreement for Depsang and Demchok.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: July 23, 2025 06:55 PM\nSource:[OneIndia](https://hindi.oneindia.com/news/india/india-china-review-border-situation-sr-dialogue-011-1345851.html)\n\n**Many Indian, Chinese soldiers injured in clash at Naku La in North Sikkim**\nA government source has reported that many Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in a clash at Naku La in North Sikkim three days ago. However, the situation is under control. The clash occurred as India and China were preparing for another round of talks to resolve their border dispute along the 3,488 kilometre-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). The two countries held a 16-hour long military dialogue on Sunday and Monday to resolve the ongoing nine-month-long border dispute. India has sought complete disengagement and withdrawal of forces from the disputed areas. The details of the meeting are awaited, which will be conveyed to the Prime Minister Office (PMO) by the military commanders. This is not the first violent clash between the two countries, as India lost 20 soldiers during a violent clash at Galwan Valley with Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers last year. The two Asian giants have been engaged in a bitter confrontation for almost nine months at the LAC, with no breakthrough despite several levels of dialogue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 09, 2025 07:27 AM\nSource:[Eleven Media Group Co., Ltd](https://elevenmyanmar.com/news/many-indian-chinese-soldiers-injured-in-clash-at-naku-la-in-north-sikkim)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across expert perspectives, expectations for China and India to ratify a bilateral border treaty before the end of 2025 are low, with most forecasts clustered in the single digits to low double digits. The experts agree that while diplomatic relations have improved since late 2024\u2014with restored patrol protocols, leader summits, and a general thaw\u2014there is a deeply entrenched pattern of incrementalism. Past agreements have overwhelmingly been protocols, memoranda, or communiques rather than ratified treaties, which typically require slow, complex processes in both countries. Factors decreasing probability include unresolved mistrust, strong nationalist and domestic political constraints, risk aversion regarding sovereignty, ongoing border incidents, and the historical base rate of treaty ratification, which is near-zero over the last three decades. The short, three-month time window further hinders the likelihood of ratification. On the positive side, the resolution criteria require only a minimally substantive treaty mentioning the border, raising the chance (slightly) for a symbolic, rapidly ratified agreement if political interests converge or international pressures mount. Nonetheless, most experts note there is no concrete evidence of such a treaty being drafted or scheduled for ratification. Only the Neoliberal Institutionalism and Realism perspectives give probabilities close to 20\u201330%, citing the low bar for success and current diplomatic normalization; the remainder, drawing on law, security studies, and negotiation precedent, remain lower (7\u201315%), with pessimism about a formal, ratified outcome in 2025. The consensus is that, barring unexpected political alignment or crisis-driven diplomatic theater, the question is likely to resolve as No.",
