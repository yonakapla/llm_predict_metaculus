State resistance continues, but recent court wins for Kalshi, another CFTC-regulated competitor, demonstrate a strong case for federal preemption\u2014at least in 1 or more states. The resolution bar is low: legality is needed in any one state and only one platform (Polymarket or Manifold) needs to qualify. There is little to no evidence of Manifold operating real-money betting with fiat or tradable crypto in a legal, regulated manner. On risk: concerted state opposition or last-minute litigation creating an effective national block would still produce a No, but the base rate for federally licensed prediction markets being able to operate at least somewhere in the US after a CFTC green light is now high, given precedent, legal clarity, and the fact that Kalshi continues to operate in at least some states. The addition of high-profile financial backers and the CFTC's public stance make a regulatory walkback in the remaining ~2 months unlikely. Therefore, the chance that either Polymarket or Manifold will legally offer real-money betting in at least one U.S. state by the end of 2025 is very high, with only black-swan level state success or regulatory reversal preventing it.",

All this has received wide financial-press coverage, and satisfies the resolution criteria requiring a regulatory/legal change. While state-level legal pushback remains a live issue, recent federal court victories suggest that event-class contract markets can at least operate in some states, and the fine print requires only one US-legal state. The mitigants are: (a) it\u2019s possible that unanticipated state or federal litigation could block or delay the launch in the remaining weeks of 2025, or (b) a technical compliance glitch prevents full onboarding of US customers with real money. However, with public plans to onboard as soon as October, and backers like ICE putting reputational and financial capital at risk, the likelihood of at least partial, legal, real-money Polymarket activity in the US in 2025 is very high and robust to most residual risks. Manifold remains irrelevant due to lack of regulatory progress. The probability is thus bold but not absolute: There remains a minor risk of late-stage legal or technical roadblock, but unless a court imposes an emergency nationwide block or the launch is quietly delayed, the odds strongly favor Yes.",

            "yes_scenario": "A likely Yes scenario: Following the acquisition of QCEX, receipt of a CFTC no-action letter, and self-certification of contract types, Polymarket publicly relaunches for US customers in late October or early November 2025, with USDC or fiat on/offramps, serving at least one US state. At least one contract type (e.g., non-sports political or financial) is available for real-money betting, with the CFTC and Polymarket both formally acknowledging the legal resumption of service. State-level efforts to block operation fail to achieve a blanket federal injunction before year-end, meaning the platform is legally accessible to US users even if restricted or challenged in some states. This public change in government policy/law fulfills resolution criteria.",
            "final_reasoning": "The clear trend in 2025 is toward federally regulated prediction markets, with aggressive expansion by Kalshi demonstrating CFTC preemption in federal courts and the successful navigation of initial state pushback. The Polymarket acquisition of a designated contract market (QCEX), receipt of a CFTC no-action letter, $2 billion in institutional investment from ICE, and public plans for a US relaunch\u2014all supported by regulatory documentation\u2014provide strong, near-definitive evidence for at least partial legal operation, satisfactory to the resolution criteria. Major caveats remain from state-level opposition (particularly for sports contracts), but (1) the fine print only requires legality in at least one state, (2) federal regulatory changes and explicit licensing create a public change in law/policy, and (3) historical analogues (e.g., Kalshi) suggest that state resistance will result in partial market blocking, not absolute prohibition. Manifold is irrelevant for 2025. While there is non-trivial legal risk of new lawsuits or federal legislative reversal, the timeline and political hurdles (2026 midterms, slow federal response) make it extremely improbable for these to retroactively prevent legal operation by the end of 2025. Thus, with Polymarket's relaunch imminent under CFTC relief, and all Metaculus resolution criteria apparently met, the probability of a 'Yes' is extremely high, though not quite 100% (allowing for a last-minute legal stay, or formal CFTC reversal, both rare and telegraphed in advance).",

While multiple states are contesting prediction markets' legality\u2014both federally licensed (Kalshi) and potentially Polymarket\u2014the question requires only that 'at least one US state' legally allows operations following public policy change.

The no-action letter, Polymarket's explicit relaunch timeline, and the lack (as of mid-October) of any final adverse federal or blanket state ruling signal a substantial regulatory breakthrough. The main risk is that a court, Congress, or the CFTC will act to re-block operation imminently, but there is currently no hard evidence they have or will succeed before January 1, 2026. Setting the base rate for new US real-money prediction market licenses in a given year is historically <5%, but the question is now much more specific\u2014after the CFTC's affirmative action and multi-billion-dollar investment, the odds jump sharply. Given residual legal turbulence and possible last-minute federal or judicial reversals (as well as potential effects of the betting scandal), a discount is appropriate, but the core criteria (public change in US law or regulator policy, at least one market, at least one state) appear almost sure to be met as of mid-October 2025.

Polymarket relaunches and begins operations, advertising legal real-money prediction markets to U.S. users in compliance with all relevant laws.",

The evidence shows that Polymarket has achieved significant regulatory progress: 1) It acquired a DCM license and a no-action letter from the CFTC, which allows operation at the federal level; 2) Institutional investment\u2014most notably by ICE\u2014and strategic partnerships have increased industry credibility; 3) Polymarket has prepared for an October 2025 relaunch in the U.S. However, state-level challenges remain unresolved and acute. News as of mid-October shows ongoing lawsuits and regulatory conflicts (NV, OH, MA, NJ), with state authorities frequently resisting federal preemption. While some states have relented (NV, NJ in the case of Kalshi), others have doubled down, suggesting a non-uniform legal patchwork unlikely to be fully resolved by the end of the year. The explicit requirement for a public legal or policy change, not merely a company's willingness to risk enforcement or rely on ambiguous precedent, raises the bar for Yes resolution. Moreover, scandals (e.g., Nobel prize betting) and political backlash are likely to make rapid, unambiguous policy change less probable before 2026. While the probability of eventual legalization is high, the specific requirement for clear, public legal authority by end-2025, with lawsuits still pending and state opposition continuing, limits the likelihood for this short window. However, Polymarket's CFTC status and high-profile relaunch plans suggest that a 'Yes' is possible if a public, favorable court ruling or regulatory ruling emerges in time. Thus, weighing these factors, I place the forecast at 60%, reflecting more-likely-than-not odds due to extraordinary recent progress and clear CFTC approval, but with meaningful risk of delays, ambiguities, or jurisdictional deadlock.",

These developments meet the explicit Metaculus requirement for public regulatory change. However, persistent state-level resistance, ongoing court battles (see Kalshi in Ohio, Massachusetts, etc.), and the chance of limited market types or unforeseen retaliation/withdrawal inject real risk the launch is delayed, blocked, or too constrained to count. That said, the federal preemption argument is winning in recent court cases, and Polymarket's ICE backing and partnerships signal institutional robustness that may push through opposition\u2014especially for even a minimal launch in a single state. Behavioral regulation economics suggests the presence of 'skin in the game' deters both speculative and regulatory inertia if a federally-licensed actor (Polymarket) follows Kalshi's CFTC playbook. Base rate for similar CFTC-licensed fintech innovations (and sports betting, post-2018) after explicit federal blessing is above 70% within a 2-6 month window. Given all this, and despite scandal-driven uncertainty, I assess a ~85% probability that real-money betting on Polymarket will become legal in the United States (i.e., in at least one state) by the end of 2025.

The fine print requires clear, public legal change, and actual operation\u2014mere intent or backend approval is not sufficient. The base case is that at least some US users will be able to trade legally for real money on Polymarket by year-end, even if not in all 50 states\u2014but legal ambiguity or last-minute opposition in all major states could still derail this. Public Choice Theory suggests that rent-seeking by powerful incumbents (casinos, sports betting interests), political caution near elections, and regulatory layering all act as veto points, but also that self-interested regulators respond to political incentives, which may favor opening the markets once high-profile federal approval is extended.

Sure, CFTC's DCM license and no-action letter are big\u2014but they're not the only public action required by the resolution, nor are they always operationally sufficient given state sovereignty under the federal system. Recent court battles (see Robinhood and Kalshi) show it's not as simple as 'federal approval equals green light': states can and are using every trick to contest, delay, or restrict operation, and platforms do change onboarding or payout practice as a result. Also, the Metaculus fine print expects visible, effective operation\u2014not just corporate press releases\u2014so lawsuits or emergency injunctions in the coming months could stymie even a CFTC-blessed relaunch in practice. ICE backing and relaunch plans can be delayed or narrowed by coordinated AG action, and technical missteps in 'real-money' onboarding are a classic stumbling point. You're vastly underplaying these cross-jurisdictional veto points. Until there's clear evidence that Polymarket is fully active with legal fiat or redeemable crypto betting in any state, and no last-minute court or regulatory block has materialized, you're rolling the dice too much at 93%."

Consensus is strong: the CFTC no-action letter and DCM license are public, explicit government actions, and the fine print only requires legality in one state and one public government change. The legal momentum, institutional backing (ICE), and recent court precedents (Kalshi) greatly reduce the plausibility of a nationwide last-minute block or reversal.

The main argument against a more extreme forecast (near 100%) is the risk (however slim) of severe, last-minute regulatory or legal reversal creating an effective national block. Yet, this is not only historically unprecedented in such a short window but contradicted by recent successful federal preemption in analogous cases (Kalshi). State resistance is too fragmented and lacking the federal teeth to stop launch in at least one state. The fine print's low bar\u2014any state, any public government action\u2014remains crucial.

(2) The dissenting voices (notably PoliticalScience/PolicyChangeTheory) are persuasively critiqued for overweighting state resistance despite recent federal court precedents and the demonstrated inability of state-level legal action to quickly or uniformly block CFTC-regulated markets like Kalshi from US operation, especially for the period and minimal scope required for resolution.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n[Prediction markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market) are exchange-traded markets established for trading bets in the outcome of various events.

Similar to Metaculus, prediction markets harness the wisdom of the crowds to provide [accurate](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-market-faq) probabilistic estimates for future events.\n\nPrediction markets are tightly controlled in the US, with very few of them (e.g., [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)) being approved by the CFTC. The largest prediction market as of the writing of this question, [Polymarket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymarket) was fined by the CTFC in 2022 and stopped offering access to US customers. Another large prediction market, [Manifold](https://manifold.markets/) allows users to bet almost exclusively using play money.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":31340,\"question_id\":30969}}`",

The Future of Real-time Trading and Forecasting**\nPolymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Polygon blockchain, has gained significant attention from Wall Street following a US$2 billion investment by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. The partnership positions ICE as a global distributor of Polymarket\u2019s event-driven data, providing institutional clients with real-time market sentiment indicators. ICE and Polymarket also plan to collaborate on tokenization initiatives integrating prediction market data with DeFi technologies. Polymarket operates on a non-custodial, trustless model using smart contracts and the USDC stablecoin, enabling transparent, censorship-resistant trading on real-world events. Its popularity surged during the 2024 US presidential election cycle, with daily trading volumes spiking during key events like the June 2024 presidential debate and the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. By early September 2024, the presidential winner market alone processed hundreds of millions in trading volume. The platform also saw viral engagement from pop culture events, such as Taylor Swift\u2019s engagement to Travis Kelce. Despite a 2022 CFTC enforcement action that led to blocking US users and a US$1.4 million penalty, Polymarket regained regulatory approval after acquiring QCX for US$112 million in Q3 2025, securing a designated contract market license. It now plans to relaunch for US users in October 2025 with four self-certified contract types. While Polymarket is decentralized and international, its main competitor Kalshi, a regulated centralized exchange based in the US, surpassed it in trading volume and market share by September 2025, holding 66% of the global market. Kalshi\u2019s growth is driven by its compliance with US regulations and its focus on real-money contracts. Both platforms are expanding through strategic partnerships\u2014Elon Musk and Donald Trump Jr. have endorsed Polymarket, with X naming it its official prediction market partner in June 2025, and MetaMask planning native integration in 2025. The ICE-Polymarket deal marks a pivotal moment for decentralized forecasting, signaling institutional adoption and the potential integration of real-time event data into mainstream financial strategy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-are-prediction-markets-future-real-time-trading-and-forecasting)\n\n**Prediction markets grow as alternative to casinos**\nPrediction markets have surged in popularity in recent years, challenging traditional casinos amid declining tourism in Las Vegas. Kalshi, one of the two largest players alongside Polymarket, operates under federal regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), allowing it to bypass state-level gambling authorities\u2014even in states where sports betting is illegal. Kalshi recently won two lawsuits in Nevada and New Jersey, affirming its right to operate outside state regulation. The company has a $5 billion valuation, up from $2 billion just three months prior, while Polymarket has grown eightfold since a $1 billion valuation in August. Total trades on Kalshi reached $300 million last year, with projections of over $50 billion in trading volume by 2025. The American Gaming Association, led by CEO Bill Miller, criticizes prediction markets as 'free riders' undermining state-regulated gambling, and companies like Kalshi were excluded from the G2E gaming conference. Despite legal uncertainty, prediction markets are gaining credibility: during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Kalshi projected Donald Trump with over 60% odds, outperforming split polls. Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, argues that prediction markets offer greater accuracy than traditional polls and give participants 'skin in the game.' Donald Trump Jr. has become an adviser to both Kalshi and Polymarket following his father\u2019s 2024 election victory.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[The Center Square: Nevada](https://www.thecentersquare.com/nevada/article_86022fcb-434e-4240-bbce-4641cc7b84e2.html?a)\n\n**Potential Nobel Peace Prize Betting Scandal: Norway Investigates Suspicious Polymarket Activity - Brave New Coin**\nNorwegian authorities are investigating suspicious activity on the crypto prediction platform Polymarket, where three accounts\u2014'dirtycup', '6741', and 'GayPride'\u2014placed large bets on Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, earning combined profits of approximately $90,000. The bets were placed hours before the official announcement on October 10, 2025, with Machado\u2019s odds on Polymarket surging from 3.6% to over 70% within hours. The accounts were newly created with no prior trading history, raising concerns about information leaks. Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, stated that espionage is 'highly likely' the cause, rather than an internal leak, noting that the Nobel Committee\u2019s selection process involves only five members and is kept secret for decades. Nobel Committee Chairman J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes affirmed there has never been a confirmed leak in the prize\u2019s history. The incident occurred amid Polymarket\u2019s $2 billion investment by Intercontinental Exchange, valuing the platform at $9 billion, and its return to U.S. markets after a 2022 $1.4 million fine for operating without registration. Polymarket\u2019s terms do not prohibit insider trading, creating a regulatory blind spot. The platform processed over $6 billion in trades in the first half of 2025 and has drawn scrutiny for predicting high-stakes events with unusual accuracy. The Nobel Peace Prize market alone saw $21.4 million in trading volume from July to October 2025. With competitors like Kalshi capturing over 60% of the global prediction market share and $50 billion in annual volume, the industry is growing rapidly. The case marks the first known instance of a blockchain-based prediction market potentially exposing confidential information from a major international institution, raising urgent questions about information security, regulatory oversight, and the ethics of prediction markets. Machado, 58, was awarded the prize for her work promoting democracy in Venezuela, having founded S\u00famate in 2002 and enduring threats while living in hiding after being barred from the 2024 presidential election. The Norwegian Nobel Institute continues its internal review and plans to strengthen security, though it maintains external espionage is more probable than an internal breach. Neither Polymarket nor the Nobel Institute has issued detailed public statements, and attempts to contact the traders have failed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 09:20 PM\nSource:[Brave New Coin](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/potential-nobel-peace-prize-betting-scandal-norway-investigates-suspicious-polymarket-activity)\n\n**Kalshi and Polymarket valuations exceed $5bn and $8bn**\nPrediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket have achieved valuations of $5 billion and $8 billion, respectively, driven by strong investor confidence despite ongoing regulatory challenges. Kalshi, which is regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), announced a global expansion to over 140 countries, excluding Bulgaria, France, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the UK, Australia, and Canada. This move creates a unified global liquidity pool, a unique feature distinguishing it from fragmented regional platforms. Kalshi raised $300 million in a Series D round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, with its founders emphasizing compliance and licensure as key to building trust. Polymarket, after exiting the U.S. in 2022 due to CFTC settlement, has since re-entered via acquisition and secured a $2 billion investment from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), boosting its valuation to $8 billion. The partnership enables ICE to distribute Polymarket\u2019s event-driven data and collaborate on blockchain initiatives. Both platforms face scrutiny over ethical concerns, such as a spike in bets on Maria Corina Machado winning the Nobel Peace Prize, prompting an official investigation and speculation of data leaks. Regulatory environments remain inconsistent: some countries classify prediction markets as gambling, while others treat them as financial instruments. Despite this, platforms see global growth potential, with Allwyn (UK Lottery operator) acquiring PrizePicks to expand into the U.S. predictions market. Kalshi asserts that 'events don't stop at borders, and now, neither does trading on them,' highlighting the cross-border relevance of prediction markets for elections, central bank decisions, sports, and climate events.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 07:00 AM\nSource:[SBC News](https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2025/10/14/kalshi-polymarket-growth/)\n\n**Senate Dems submit crypto market structure proposal, world ends**\nSenate Democrats have submitted the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), a comprehensive proposal aimed at regulating the crypto market structure, which has sparked strong reactions from the crypto industry and state gaming regulators.

In a related development, MetaMask\u2019s integration with Polymarket\u2014allowing users to trade in sports, crypto, and politics within the platform\u2014has angered state gaming regulators, especially as Polymarket and rival Kalshi operate in states where online sports betting is illegal. Nevada regulators issued a cease-and-desist order against Kalshi, which is licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), prompting a preliminary injunction and ongoing legal battles. Other states have followed suit with similar orders, some favoring Kalshi, others not. U.S. senators have written to CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham, demanding clarification on why the CFTC permits such cross-state prediction market operations, arguing it undermines state and tribal authority over sports betting. The senators have requested a response by October 30, 2025. The legislative process faces delays, with Senator Steil warning that approaching the 2026 midterm elections could make passage increasingly difficult.

The Future of Real-time Trading and Forecasting**\nPolymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Polygon blockchain, has gained significant attention from Wall Street following a US$2 billion investment by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. The partnership positions ICE as a global distributor of Polymarket\u2019s event-driven data, providing institutional clients with real-time market sentiment indicators. ICE and Polymarket also plan to collaborate on tokenization initiatives integrating prediction market data with DeFi technologies. Polymarket operates on a non-custodial, trustless model using smart contracts and the USDC stablecoin, enabling transparent, censorship-resistant trading on real-world events. Its popularity surged during the 2024 US presidential election cycle, with daily trading volumes spiking during key events like the June 2024 presidential debate and the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. By early September 2024, the presidential winner market alone processed hundreds of millions in trading volume. The platform also saw viral engagement from pop culture events, such as Taylor Swift\u2019s engagement to Travis Kelce. Despite a 2022 CFTC enforcement action that led to blocking US users and a US$1.4 million penalty, Polymarket regained regulatory approval after acquiring QCX for US$112 million in Q3 2025, securing a designated contract market license. It now plans to relaunch for US users in October 2025 with four self-certified contract types. While Polymarket is decentralized and international, its main competitor Kalshi, a regulated centralized exchange based in the US, surpassed it in trading volume and market share by September 2025, holding 66% of the global market. Kalshi\u2019s growth is driven by its compliance with US regulations and its focus on real-money contracts. Both platforms are expanding through strategic partnerships\u2014Elon Musk and Donald Trump Jr. have endorsed Polymarket, with X naming it its official prediction market partner in June 2025, and MetaMask planning native integration in 2025. The ICE-Polymarket deal marks a pivotal moment for decentralized forecasting, signaling institutional adoption and the potential integration of real-time event data into mainstream financial strategy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-are-prediction-markets-future-real-time-trading-and-forecasting)\n\n**Prediction markets grow as alternative to casinos**\nPrediction markets have surged in popularity in recent years, challenging traditional casinos amid declining tourism in Las Vegas. Kalshi, one of the two largest players alongside Polymarket, operates under federal regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), allowing it to bypass state-level gambling authorities\u2014even in states where sports betting is illegal.

This integration enables web3 developers, institutions, and decentralized protocols to build applications using real-time probabilities of future outcomes in areas such as politics, economics, sports, crypto, and culture. Kalshi, regulated by the CFTC, provides credibility, oversight, and scale, positioning event-driven data as a foundational component of DeFi. The collaboration follows Kalshi\u2019s expansion to 140 countries and a $300 million funding round at a $5 billion valuation. Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs and Pyth contributor, noted that prediction markets have become powerful tools for translating expectations into real-time prices, especially during high-profile events like the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Live Kalshi markets are now accessible via Pyth, with 0xUltra stating that oracles are the first step in bringing Kalshi onchain, enabling builders to implement their ideas on the 'world computer.'

Robinhood argues that its event-based trading platform, which includes sports outcome contracts, falls under federal commodities law and should be exempt from state regulation. Massachusetts rejected this claim, calling Robinhood's reasoning 'smoke and mirrors' and citing federal court rulings that affirm state authority over gambling regulation. The state referenced a prior case involving Crypto.com, which was barred from offering sports bets in Nevada, and emphasized that states retain the right to independently define gambling, despite Robinhood's assertion that federal law preempts state rules. A similar legal conflict is unfolding in Ohio, where Kalshi has sued the Ohio Casino Control Commission and state attorney general, claiming that Ohio's cease-and-desist actions and warnings to licensed sportsbooks unlawfully blocked its access to users and partners. Kalshi contends its markets are federally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and seeks an injunction before October 20 to halt further enforcement. Ohio officials maintain that only licensed operators may conduct sports wagering in the state. Separately, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) fined DraftKings $450,000 in August for accepting 1,160 unlawful credit card bets totaling over $83,000 between March 2023 and February 2024. The violations, affecting 218 customers and 242 deposits, were attributed to systemic failures in communication and coordination among DraftKings\u2019 compliance, licensing, and product teams, despite the company\u2019s voluntary disclosure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 02:14 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/massachusetts-responds-after-robinhood-requests-injunction-oct-14-2025)\n\n**Investigation Launched into Polymarket Betting on 2025 Nobel Peace Prize Winner**\nNorwegian authorities have launched an investigation into betting activities on the prediction platform Polymarket related to the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, amid concerns of potential espionage. Data from Polymarket revealed that a user named 'dirtycup' earned over $30,000 from bets totaling approximately $70,000 on Machado. Three accounts collectively made around $90,000 in profits from similar wagers. The Norwegian Nobel Institute, which supports the Nobel Committee, is examining reports that betting volumes surged sharply before the announcement, raising suspicions of insider information being exploited. Machado, recognized for her democratic advocacy in Venezuela, previously praised Bitcoin (BTC) as a 'lifesaver' during hyperinflation, enabling citizens to protect wealth and fund escapes. Polymarket, launched in 2020, allows users to bet on diverse events, including Nobel Prizes and music sales. Last week, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion in Polymarket, signaling major growth. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a no-action letter, allowing Polymarket to operate without mandatory data reporting, effectively granting regulatory approval for its U.S. launch. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket\u2019s CEO, reportedly became a billionaire following the ICE investment.

The platform\u2019s decentralized prediction market enables risk-free gains when the sum of outcome probabilities falls below $1.00\u2014such as a total of $0.995 across four possible results\u2014allowing traders to buy all outcomes and guarantee a 0.5% profit upon resolution. This strategy, though small in percentage, becomes highly lucrative at scale: a trader investing $10,000 and executing dozens of such trades daily could achieve substantial annual returns. These opportunities, lasting only seconds, are now dominated by automated bots running on the Polygon network, which scan thousands of markets in real time to exploit discrepancies. Another strategy, 'Endgame Sweep,' involves buying near-certain outcomes (priced between $0.95 and $0.99) and waiting for final resolution, relying on the principle that time trades for certainty. However, even this strategy carries 'black swan' risks, such as last-minute reversals due to legal challenges, sports errors, or misinformation. Despite the appearance of fairness, the market is heavily skewed: data from BlockBeats shows only 0.51% of users earn over $1,000, and just 1.74% of trades exceed $50,000 in volume. The vast majority of traders lose money, while a small, technologically advanced minority\u2014using code, speed, and low-latency systems\u2014capture the bulk of profits. These arbitrageurs also serve a vital market-making function by reducing spreads and improving liquidity, with one estimate suggesting they earned over $20 million in the past year. As Polymarket expands\u2014with a 4% yield offer for the 2028 U.S. election market and speculation about an IPO or token airdrop\u2014opportunities for arbitrage are expected to grow, though the playing field remains tilted toward high-frequency, algorithmic traders. As Jeremy Whittaker noted on Medium, 'Arbitrage on Polymarket isn\u2019t gambling\u2014it\u2019s technique. You\u2019re not betting on the outcome.

According to Erik Aasheim, spokesperson for the Nobel Institute, a mysterious user with the username '6741' placed large bets on Machado\u2019s victory approximately 12 hours before the announcement, when she was considered an unlikely contender. Within two hours, the market probability for Machado rose from 5% to nearly 70%, driven by this user\u2019s activity on a newly created account. '6741' reportedly earned over $50,000 in profits. Another user, 'GayPride', began placing large bets after public attention grew, ultimately winning more than $85,000. The event raised concerns about insider information, especially given the timing\u2014just after midnight in Oslo\u2014coinciding with the surge in betting activity. Polymarket, which operates offshore and is technically prohibited for U.S. users, does not ban insider trading, so no legal violation may have occurred. The platform, founded five years ago by Shayne Coplan, has faced regulatory scrutiny, including a 2022 settlement with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), leading to the blocking of American users. However, in September, Cryptopolitan reported that Polymarket acquired a licensed CFTC exchange, signaling plans to re-enter the U.S. market. The event gained attention due to Donald Trump\u2019s public campaign for Machado, turning the prize into a trending topic and boosting participation on prediction markets.

According to Erik Aasheim, a spokesperson for the Nobel Institute in Norway, suspicious betting activity began just after midnight in Oslo, raising concerns of insider information. A trader using the pseudonym '6741' placed large bets on Machado\u2019s victory about 12 hours before the announcement, when she was considered an unlikely candidate. Within two hours, the trader\u2019s activity caused market volatility, increasing Machado\u2019s odds from 5% to nearly 70%. The trader exited with over $50,000 in profit from a newly created account. Another user, 'GayPride', also profited over $85,000 after noticing the initial surge. Neither Polymarket nor the Nobel Institute responded to media inquiries, and The Wall Street Journal was unable to contact '6741'. Polymarket operates offshore and is technically prohibited for U.S. users, meaning it does not enforce rules against insider trading. Even if a Nobel insider leaked the result, it may not violate U.S. law. Harvard economist Jason Furman commented online, saying he now has a real-world example of insider trading in prediction markets.

U.S. senators have written to CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham, demanding clarification on why the CFTC permits such cross-state prediction market operations, arguing it undermines state and tribal authority over sports betting. The senators have requested a response by October 30, 2025. The legislative process faces delays, with Senator Steil warning that approaching the 2026 midterm elections could make passage increasingly difficult. The debate reflects deep divisions over regulatory authority, innovation, and jurisdiction in the evolving digital asset landscape.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[coingeek.com](https://coingeek.com/senate-dems-submit-crypto-market-structure-proposal-world-ends/)\n\n**How Polymarket Works: The Prediction Market Betting on Real-World Events**\nPolymarket is a prediction market platform that allows users to bet on real-world future events, such as U.S. presidential election outcomes or the next country to leave the European Union. Operating with cryptocurrency\u2014specifically the USDC stablecoin\u2014the platform functions like a futures exchange where users buy and sell 'yes' or 'no' shares representing possible outcomes. The price of each share, ranging from US$0.01 to US$0.99, reflects the market's collective probability of an event occurring; for example, a 'yes' share priced at US$0.70 implies a 70% probability of the event happening. If the event occurs, the share is worth US$1, yielding a US$0.30 profit per share. If not, the share becomes worthless. The platform leverages the 'wisdom of crowds' to generate real-time predictions. It recently attracted investment from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, signaling growing interest from traditional finance. However, regulatory challenges persist\u2014particularly in the U.S., where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has raised concerns about its similarity to illegal binary options contracts. Users face significant risks, including cryptocurrency volatility, lack of investor protection, and personal responsibility for wallet security. Access requires a crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and familiarity with USDC transactions, making it accessible but complex for non-technical users. Despite its risks, Polymarket is viewed as a powerful tool for aggregating information and improving forecasting accuracy in areas ranging from politics to business.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[Jornal Estado de Minas | Not\ufffdcias Online](https://www.em.com.br/economia/2025/10/7266933-como-funciona-o-polymarket-a-bolsa-de-apostas-em-acontecimentos.html)\n\n**Prediction markets: What they are and how they work**\nPrediction markets are financial exchanges where individuals can bet on the outcomes of future events by purchasing binary contracts that pay out if the predicted outcome occurs. These markets operate on the principle of the 'wisdom of the crowd' with financial stakes, as described by Leo Chan, CEO of Sportstensor, who emphasizes that the intent is information exchange rather than gambling. Contracts typically pay $1 if correct and cost less based on perceived odds\u2014e.g., a $0.80 'yes' contract implies an 80% expected probability. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates real-money prediction markets in the U.S., and platforms like Polymarket and Robinhood offer access to users, though Polymarket was previously fined $1.4 million and ceased U.S. operations in 2022 under CFTC pressure. Polymarket regained CFTC approval to relaunch in the U.S. in September 2025 and acquired QCEX, a licensed derivatives exchange. Risks include financial loss, market manipulation by well-funded market makers, and legal uncertainty\u2014especially for sporting event contracts, with ongoing cases against Kalshi. Experts are divided on whether prediction markets constitute gambling: Chan argues they are information markets, while Daniel O'Boyle views them as gambling due to financial stakes. Users can trade contracts in real time, adjusting positions as odds shift based on new information or market activity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

During the 2020\u20112024 U.S. presidential election, the two sites collectively handled more than $3\u202fbillion in bets, producing forecasts that outperformed many traditional polls.  Investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the firms: Polymarket raised $200\u202fmillion in a June 2024 round led by Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, and Kalshi raised $185\u202fmillion in the same month, valuing it at $2\u202fbillion.  The piece highlights both the promise and the peril of the industry.  Sequoia venture capitalist Alfred Lin describes the markets to Fortune as \"basically truth machines,\" while Kalshi co\u2011founder Tarek Mansour explains that the markets work because they are a market\u2011based mechanism that provides the wisdom of the crowds and because participants have real money on the line.  Critics, however, argue that the platforms are essentially gambling sites.  The article recounts several controversies: accusations of \"assassination markets,\" a CFTC consent decree that barred Polymarket from operating in the U.S., allegations of wash trading, a federal raid on Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan\u2019s apartment, and a Kalshi\u2011led social\u2011media campaign that used influencers to comment on the raid.  Legal challenges remain, including the question of whether prediction markets can be distinguished from gambling under state law.  The article concludes that the sector\u2019s future hinges on sustaining interest beyond election cycles and on building a critical mass of liquidity and accurate predictions.\n\nKey metrics and quotes:  \u2022 $3\u202fbillion in bets during the 2020\u20112024 election;  \u2022 $1\u202fbillion in monthly wagers;  \u2022 35\u202fmillion visitors this summer;  \u2022 $200\u202fmillion investment for Polymarket;  \u2022 $185\u202fmillion investment for Kalshi;  \u2022 \"basically truth machines\" \u2013 Alfred Lin;  \u2022 \"They're a market\u2011based mechanism, so you get the wisdom of the crowds\" \u2013 Tarek Mansour.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:31 AM\nSource:[Fortune](https://fortune.com/article/prediction-markets-kalshi-polymarket-election-trump-harris/)\n\n**Trump\u2019s Family Drives Boom in Future\u2011Event Betting Markets**\nThe article reports that the future\u2011event betting market, led by platforms Kalshi and Polymarket, has experienced an unprecedented boom, moving more than 1.3\u202fbillion dollars each month and attracting valuations up to 9\u202f000\u202fmillion dollars, according to the source.  The platforms allow users to buy \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 shares on events, with prices reflecting perceived probabilities; a 25\u2011cent share implies a 25\u202f% chance of the event occurring.  Kalshi is the first platform authorised by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to trade event contracts, while Polymarket operates on a blockchain\u2011based, decentralised model.  Both platforms have attracted high\u2011profile investors such as Peter Thiel, Vitalik Buterin, Joe Gebbia and Thomas Peterffy, and have been promoted by the Trump family.  Donald Trump Jr. joined Kalshi as a strategic adviser in January 2024 and invested in Polymarket in August 2024, becoming a member of its advisory board.  The article cites a quote from founder Tarek Mansour: 'Muchas de las operaciones de trading corrientes ya est\u00e1n basadas en la opini\u00f3n de los inversores de lo que pueda pasar. As\u00ed que pensamos: '\u00bfy por qu\u00e9 no les damos la opci\u00f3n de invertir directamente en esos eventos?''.  It also quotes the CEO\u2019s statement: 'Queremos construir el mercado comercial m\u00e1s grande del planeta'.  The piece notes that Kalshi won a federal court case in September\u202f2024 that allowed it to offer presidential\u2011election contracts, after a year\u2011long legal battle with the CFTC.  Despite federal approval, seven states\u2014including Nevada and New Jersey\u2014have sent cease\u2011and\u2011desist letters alleging that sports\u2011event contracts are illegal bets.  The article concludes with a criticism from Democrat Congresswoman Dina Titus: 'Esa agencia est\u00e1 en ruinas. No hay ninguna supervisi\u00f3n real'.  The tone is largely explanatory, presenting facts, metrics and direct quotes without overt editorialising.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2025-09-21/kalshi-polymarket-apuestas-eventos-futuros-trump_4212526/)\n\n**Sports Prediction Site Polymarket Nearing Return to U.S.**\nA 'no-action' letter from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) indicates that Polymarket, the world\u2019s largest prediction market, could soon resume operations in the United States. The letter, issued in response to a request from QCEX \u2013 an exchange Polymarket acquired in July \u2013 was described by CEO Shayne Coplan on X as a 'green light to go live' and prompted him to tell followers to 'stay tuned.' Polymarket had been barred from serving U.S. customers since early 2022 after a settlement with the CFTC for offering off\u2011exchange event\u2011based binary options contracts without the required designation as a designated contract market or registration as a swap execution facility. Despite the ban, the company has operated offshore, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars in bets worldwide, including on sporting events. The potential return would position Polymarket as a major competitor to existing CFTC\u2011regulated entities such as Kalshi, Robinhood, and Underdog, as well as state\u2011regulated online sports betting sites. The combination of the QCEX acquisition, the addition of Donald Trump Jr. as an adviser, and the CFTC no\u2011action letter sets the stage for Polymarket to legally operate as a prediction market in the U.S.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 05:44 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/sports-prediction-site-polymarket-nearing-return-to-usa-sept-3-2025)\n\n**Polymarket Reportedly Targets Fall U.S. Launch, Football Trading**\nPolymarket, a crypto\u2011based prediction\u2011market platform, is preparing a fall 2025 launch in the United States after a three\u2011year hiatus. The company is advertising on Meta\u2011owned Facebook and Instagram, and one ad targets Texas residents with a promotion for 'legal football trading', a feature that would compete with established sportsbooks such as FanDuel and DraftKings and with other prediction markets like Kalshi. The NFL remains the most popular betting sport, generating billions of dollars in wagers during the second half of the year. Sports betting is legal in 38 U.S. states, with Missouri set to bring the total to 39 when wagering begins on Dec.\u202f1. Flutter, owner of FanDuel, has said that prediction markets have not affected its sportsbook in jurisdictions where it operates. Kalshi has offered 'Yes' and 'No' contracts on game outcomes since the Super Bowl in February, and has recently added NFL and college\u2011football markets with spreads and totals. FanDuel announced a partnership with CME Group that will allow it to offer financial prediction markets to its customers, though it has not indicated plans to offer sports\u2011outcome contracts. Polymarket, which was blocked from offering event trading in 2022 by the CFTC, acquired the federally regulated derivatives exchange QCEX for $112\u202fmillion in July, potentially enabling it to introduce sports contracts in the U.S. market. SimilarWeb data from May\u202f2025 show the platform had 15.9\u202fmillion visits, surpassing FanDuel and DraftKings, and it boasts a 94\u202f% accuracy rate in forecasting. Founded in 2020, Polymarket raised $200\u202fmillion earlier this year, pushing its valuation above $1\u202fbillion. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election, more than $3\u202fbillion in contracts were traded on the site. The company now faces a controversial landscape, as Kalshi, which gained traction during last year\u2019s election after a court ruling, is embroiled in legal disputes with several states over sports\u2011outcome contracts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/report-polymarket-targets-fall-us-launch-football-trading-aug-21-2025)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that the probability of real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the United States in 2025 has dramatically increased due to several decisive regulatory developments, particularly for Polymarket. The most influential factors are Polymarket's acquisition of a CFTC-licensed exchange (QCEX), its receipt of a CFTC no-action letter in Q3 2025, and explicit plans to relaunch for US users in October 2025. These developments constitute a clear public change in law or policy, as required by the resolution criteria. Almost all experts emphasize that the requirement for legal operation in just a single US state (not nationwide) and a public regulatory decision significantly lowers the bar for a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nHowever, experts consistently note ongoing risks: persistent and sometimes intensifying legal opposition and cease-and-desist actions from state regulators (e.g., Nevada, Ohio, Massachusetts, New Jersey) could still block or delay access in some jurisdictions. Court decisions so far suggest increasing federal preemption in some states, referencing Kalshi's court victories, but ongoing litigation could create uncertainty or a possibility for last-minute reversals. Additional risks include potential operational/technical delays, adverse publicity or scandals (such as the Nobel betting incident), or Congressional intervention, though the likelihood of major legislative or regulatory reversal before year-end is widely regarded as low given the short time remaining in 2025. Manifold is consistently disregarded as a likely path to Yes, having made no regulatory progress toward real-money operation.\n\nProbabilities among experts are tightly clustered and generally high: several experts (USLegislativeAnalysis, Law, PoliticalScience, Economics) assign probabilities between 85% and 95%, citing strong supporting evidence for at least partial legal operation in at least one state, yet stopping short of certainty due to remaining legal and practical tail risks. One outlier, specializing in Policy Change Theory, is more cautious at 60% due to concerns about resolving state-level opposition within the year and the explicit requirement for a public, unambiguous legal approval. The modal forecast is thus over 85%, with consensus that a 'Yes' is now the most likely outcome, but a small risk persists due to ongoing state litigation, regulatory ambiguity, or implementation delays. The decision is overwhelmingly driven by Polymarket; Manifold is essentially a nonfactor for 2025.",
