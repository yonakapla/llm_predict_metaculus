Recent incidents show the threat is not restricted to strictly Israeli cargo but includes broader Western-linked ships. International naval efforts, while extensive, have not prevented the most serious attacks, nor reduced overall risk for a reputationally sensitive carrier like Maersk to a tolerable level. Even partial resumption scenarios are constrained by the level of violence and unpredictable trigger criteria of the Houthis, who have consistently used maritime threats to increase pressure in negotiation cycles. While the resolution only requires a partial resumption, Maersk\u2019s risk management culture\u2014and the lack of credible, enduring improvement in the security situation\u2014make a year-end resumption improbable. Therefore, I assess the chance of Maersk resuming (even partially) by end-2025 as low but not impossible, given the possibility (albeit remote) of a rapid de-escalation or major political breakthrough.",

Further, war risk premiums drop, EU/US naval protection is boosted or operationalized effectively, and Maersk judges, perhaps after a series of successful escorted transits (possibly by rivals or chartered ships), that a partial, heavily conditioned pilot line can resume.

Naval protection is present but overstretched, and in multiple recent attacks (including September 2025), the existing international regime failed to protect ships sufficiently even when not directly Israeli-linked. Insurance markets reflect ongoing extreme risk. Historically, global container lines like Maersk do not make even partial resumptions in such settings absent a decisive, publicly visible, and externally verified reduction of threat\u2014for both safety and legal/insurance reasons. While the question only requires a partial resumption or credible announcement, there is no public sign Maersk is preparing such a move. Neither international naval presence nor the current status of diplomatic negotiations appears nearly sufficient. The only scenario supporting a YES is a rapid, high-profile diplomatic and operational change in the last weeks of 2025, for which there is little evidence.

Insurers again offer coverage, and Maersk, following an official security reassessment and with support from naval escorts, publicly announces and then executes a partial resumption of Red Sea transits by late 2025, with credible trade press (or Maersk's own channels) confirming ships transiting the dangerous region.",

In the last week alone (late Sep\u2013early Oct), a Dutch-flagged vessel was disabled and abandoned after a Houthi missile attack; this is incompatible with even a limited Maersk resumption from a risk management and ISPS Code compliance standpoint. There are no credible announcements or indications that Maersk is preparing to resume service, and recent statements from company leadership and major industry outlets remain negative/outlook-cautious. Insurance markets are still highly restrictive, and even the best international naval efforts are acknowledged by leadership (EU, Gulf States) as insufficient. Though peace negotiations could theoretically lead to a lasting security improvement, the continued volatility, recent ship attacks, and the direct threat from Houthis to any vessel seen as Israel-linked\u2014even indirectly\u2014mean Maersk is extremely unlikely to expose itself to such legal, reputational, and physical risk in 2025. The base rate for resumption of service under analogous circumstances (e.g., Gulf of Aden/Somali piracy) suggests only a sustained, months-long incident-free window\u2014supported by insurer re-entry, lowered threat levels, and demonstrably effective naval protection\u2014would allow for resumption. As of October, there is little time left for such a window to emerge and prove itself convincing to internal and external stakeholders.\n\nConsequently, the probability of Maersk resuming any Red Sea shipping in 2025 should be moderately low, as nothing in current or very recent operational, diplomatic, or security trends points toward imminent risk reduction.

Lethal Houthi attacks have continued most recently in September and early October 2025, including a disabling strike and deadly outcomes, with the group explicitly tying continued maritime aggression to Gaza issues unresolved in the current negotiations. Coupled with the ambiguity and breadth of their targeting criteria, ongoing political utility in disrupting global trade, and insufficient naval coverage, the minimum credible risk reduction necessary for Maersk to announce a return has not been met. Historic shipping risk-aversion patterns strongly suggest liner companies will not resume until several months of clear, demonstrated improvement and/or a major de-escalatory event; neither has occurred. The base rate for rapid re-engagement in high-risk maritime environments is very low especially after recent fatalities, and industry insiders emphasize the premium placed on crew safety and insurance underwriters\u2019 constraints. A YES remains plausible on a publicized partial return as part of a political/diplomatic breakthrough, but that would require a step-change in both on-water security and/or regional political situation not yet visible as of Oct 2025. Therefore, the probability Maersk will resume shipping in the Red Sea before the end of 2025 is low.",

Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, persistent spoilers (including but not limited to the Houthis) can upend or delay ceasefire plans, especially as the Houthis see their attacks as leverage and will end them only 'immediately' if the Gaza blockade/aggression ends. The international community\u2019s response remains underpowered, and there is no major technological or deployment ramp-up in naval escort. The time window is now quite short (~80 days), and Maersk will need weeks of evidence and logistical coordination before updating its policy. The strong base rate\u2014in similar prior disruptions (e.g., Somali piracy)\u2014is that shippers only return after clear, robust, and demonstrable security improvements, which are not present.

The core motive for Houthis\u2014support for Hamas and pressure on Israel\u2014remains unresolved as Israel\u2019s siege continues and peace outcomes are uncertain. Historically, Maersk is highly cautious, requiring more than a few weeks of calm or uneven traffic recovery before altering policy, and so far, the security situation remains too unstable by both base rates and current news.

Without full ISPS threat downgrades, Maersk could face not only insurance premium hikes or denial, but loss of flag-state certification or liability exposure in the event of further casualties. Plus, your argument references historical base rates, but these actually suggest that, post-fatal attacks, major shippers have historically required well-substantiated, months-long security improvement before reassuming even limited exposure.

Furthermore, the unresolved status of critical infrastructure in the Red Sea and the unyielding operational threat underscore why even a political or diplomatic breakthrough in Gaza would not instantly translate into resumed sailings.

Insurance markets, flag states, and internal risk committees have become more stringent since past piracy crises; post-multiple lethal attacks, no global liner has reversed routing in less than several incident-free months.

From the perspective of maritime security studies, I support your emphasis on historic corporate risk aversion: Following major, highly publicized security breaches and insurance/crew safety crises, global container lines (especially publicly traded ones) wait for months of demonstrable and independently verified threat reduction, not merely temporary political calm or isolated diplomatic signals.

Given all this, my previous probability estimate (15%) is confirmed; if anything, my confidence in a negative outcome is even stronger, but given already low odds and the (very slim) residual tail risk of a sudden peace deal plus visible risk reduction, I will keep the probability unchanged.",

The critiques highlight that ISPS compliance and insurance restrictions make even a minimal or partial resumption highly implausible in such a short timeframe after multiple fatal attacks, with no sustained incident-free period. My defense was previously focused on practical compliance but did not sufficiently weight that insurance and flag-state regulators would also preclude even small, time-limited returns given the October attacks. Given this, while an unexpected political/diplomatic breakthrough cannot be ruled out entirely, the effective threshold for a Yes remains extremely high.

The base rate evidence is reinforced: post-fatality environments historically see months of sustained calm before partial resumption, and Maersk would, if anything, be an industry leader in risk aversion due to its global profile. The regulatory aspect, especially the likelihood of non-compliance findings or insurance refusals without a formal ISPS Code threat downgrade, suggests that even a partial or test voyage would likely not occur unless there was a significant, sustained de-escalation, which has not occurred with less than three months to year-end.

Defenses of my reasoning reinforce the holistic necessity of layered, sustained improvements in both physical and legal/insurance conditions, which are not in evidence. No new information or argument surfaced suggesting a credible fast path to even partial resumption in 2025; in fact, group consensus slightly hardens the negative outlook owing to the depth and recency of the threat. Therefore, my original (8%) estimate was at the lower edge of group consensus, and, if anything, I could justifiably shave off another point or two.

Critiques highlight that time lags in risk ratings, insurance, and compliance frameworks, along with the very recent spike in violence, make a sudden operational resumption almost impossible in the calendar year even if a diplomatic breakthrough occurred tomorrow. Furthermore, multiple defenses and critiques collectively affirm the importance of historical base rates and strict threshold criteria for Maersk policy changes\u2014requirements which cannot be credibly met in the next 85 days.

The threat environment remains acutely hostile (as underlined by the most recent attacks), and no credible evidence points to imminent, sustained de-escalation. The only point of marginal adjustment comes from slightly more conservative peers who, based on exacting legal and ISPS Code standards, suggest even my original 15% estimate could be a touch high.

In particular, the ISPS compliance arguments clarify there are inflexible regulatory and liability ceilings that require months of proven safety before even partial, insurable resumption is viable. No new signals, whether diplomatic or operational, emerged in group feedback to warrant a less pessimistic stance; indeed, several made a strong case that even 10% may be slightly generous.

Notably, no analyst identified a credible near-term scenario that would allow Maersk to satisfy internal/external risk tests and stakeholder assurances in the time remaining. Several forecasters even argued that my initial probability\u2014while low\u2014might still overestimate the likelihood, given the perfect storm of high-profile incidents, evolving risk regulations, and compressed timelines for post-crisis assessment.

Additional arguments emphasize that even within 'partial' or limited resumption criteria, formal compliance (ISPS, flag, insurer, regulator) and internal risk management cultures act as hard ceilings, making a move within 2025 extremely unlikely. Critiques also underscore that the lag time from any hypothetical diplomatic breakthrough or peace deal to operational resumption would be substantial\u2014further reducing the feasible window to near zero.

Launched in July 2025 by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and organizations such as Global Movement and Maghreb Sumud Fleet during the Gaza conflict, the fleet comprises over 50 ships from more than 44 countries, making it the largest civilian-led convoy in history. The initiative stems from Israel's longstanding maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip since Hamas took control in 2007. Between 2008 and 2016, only 5 out of 31 aid ships attempting to break the blockade reached Gaza. The first Gaza Freedom Flotilla in 2010 was intercepted by Israeli forces, resulting in the deaths of 10 activists and dozens injured\u2014an event that drew international condemnation. Subsequent attempts in 2011, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2025 were similarly thwarted. In March 2024 to July 2024, a temporary sea corridor was opened between Cyprus and Gaza under the Safeena Operation, used by cargo vessels and the U.S. military. In March 2025, Israel imposed a three-month full blockade; in May, a flotilla was attacked by drones, and in June and July, other convoys were intercepted. The humanitarian campaign, led by the IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation and supported by groups like Free Gaza Movement and Viva Palestina, began in 2010 to deliver aid and draw global attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The campaign, with the slogan 'Our route is Palestine, our cargo is freedom,' attracted thousands of civil society organizations and activists worldwide. Supplies including medicine, medical equipment, cement, iron, toys, playground equipment, and school materials were loaded onto ships such as Defne Y, Gaza 1, and Mavi Marmara, departing from Istanbul on May 22, 2010. The Mavi Marmara, escorted by a farewell ceremony at Sarayburnu Port and carrying 560 passengers from 32 countries and various faiths\u2014including 50 foreign journalists\u2014sailed from Antalya Port on May 28, 2010. It joined five other ships in international waters off Cyprus, forming a flotilla bound for Gaza. On the night of May 30\u201331, 2010, Israeli forces sent threatening radio messages and launched air and sea harassment. Israeli commandos, using helicopters and Zodiac boats, attacked the fleet, deploying smoke and sound bombs before opening fire indiscriminately. Nine Turkish aid volunteers were killed, over 50 injured, and one, U\u011fur S\u00fcleyman S\u00f6ylemez, died four years later, raising the death toll to 10. Despite failing to reach Gaza, the flotilla succeeded in capturing global attention, symbolizing resistance and hope. The article concludes by quoting a poem by Yahya Kemal, affirming that these 'ships adorned with free horizons' will, as before, bring freedom to the people of Palestine and Gaza, and that this movement will inspire future generations of heroes.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 12:30 AM\nSource:[Yeni Akit Gazetesi](https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/yazarlar/ahmet-talib-celen/hur-ufuklarda-donanmis-iki-yuz-pare-gemi-50363.html)\n\n**Houthi Missile Attack Leaves Merchant Ship Unseaworthy; EU-Led Rescue Operation Successfully Evacuates Crew**\nOn October 5, 2025, the official X account of the EU's 'Aspides Operation' released footage of a rescue mission following a missile attack on the Dutch-flagged merchant vessel 'MV Minerva Grahat' on September 30, 2025. The ship, located 128 nautical miles southeast of Aden Port, Yemen, was struck by a ballistic missile-like object on September 29, 2025, according to the EU. The vessel, which had not requested protection from EU warships, caught fire and became unseaworthy. Upon receiving a distress call from the captain, the EU naval task force dispatched a rescue team and successfully evacuated 19 crew members\u2014comprising Russians, Ukrainians, Filipinos, and Sri Lankans\u2014two of whom were seriously injured. The operation involved naval vessels and aircraft from the Italian and Greek navies. The Houthi rebels claimed responsibility on October 1, stating the ship was targeted because it was classified as a vessel prohibited from entering ports in 'occupied Palestine'\u2014a designation tied to their solidarity with Hamas. The Houthis have been attacking ships they believe are linked to Israel, including those with only tenuous ties, prompting the EU, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India to deploy warships to escort merchant vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 09:12 PM\nSource:[\u4e57\u308a\u3082\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://trafficnews.jp/post/592178)\n\n**EU-GCC: Opening speech by High Representative Kaja Kallas at the High-Level Forum on Regional Security and Cooperation**\nAt the High-Level Forum on Regional Security and Cooperation, High Representative Kaja Kallas delivered an opening speech emphasizing the need for diplomacy and cooperation between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). She highlighted three key regional challenges: Iran\u2019s nuclear program, maritime security in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and the situation in Gaza. Regarding Iran, she noted that despite intensive EU diplomatic efforts during the 30-day snapback window triggered by France, Germany, and the UK, a resolution to extend the UNSC Resolution was not achieved; as a result, the EU will re-impose all previously lifted UN and EU nuclear-related sanctions without delay, while reaffirming that diplomacy must continue. On maritime security, Kallas condemned Houthi attacks on international shipping, including the sinking of two Greek cargo ships, an attack on a tanker, and an explosion on a Dutch-flagged vessel, stressing that such acts violate freedom of navigation\u2014a global public good. She highlighted EU Operation ASPIDES, which has protected over 560 vessels and monitored or supported another 600, with anti-air frigates deploying daily; the operation has been extended to February 2026, with further extension under consideration. She called for a coordinated regional approach, including strengthening the Yemeni Coast Guard. On Gaza, she acknowledged Qatar\u2019s direct experience of conflict spillover, including a strike on its sovereignty, welcomed the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s apology, and expressed support for President Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan, noting Hamas\u2019s announced acceptance. She stressed that lasting peace depends on a two-state solution and urged collective action to build on momentum from the UN General Assembly to resume political talks. Kallas concluded by affirming shared interests between the EU and GCC across multiple domains and emphasized that cooperation, not confrontation, should define international relations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 07:11 PM\nSource:[Europa](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/eu-gcc-opening-speech-high-representative-kaja-kallas-high-level-forum-regional-security-and_en)\n\n**Houthi Movement Launches New Missile Strike on Jerusalem, Reaffirms Support for Hamas Amid Escalating Conflict**\nHouthi movement (Ansar Allah) reaffirmed its full support for Hamas and other Palestinian factions in their resistance against the Israeli occupation, particularly in response to the latest Trump peace plan. In a statement, the Houthi government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that Palestinian resilience would force Israel to end its aggression, genocide, and the blockade of Gaza, emphasizing that Israel has failed to eliminate resistance or displace Gaza\u2019s population. The group criticized Israel for violating agreements with Hamas and Lebanon, while praising international support for Palestine. On October 5, 2025, the Houthis announced a successful military operation using a hypersonic, multi-warhead ballistic missile named 'Palestine 2' targeting sensitive sites in occupied Jerusalem, which reportedly caused mass evacuations of Israeli civilians. The Israeli military confirmed intercepting the missile, activating air raid sirens, and closing Ben Gurion Airport. This marks the first such deep Israeli strike by the Houthis since September 29, 2024, when they conducted two prior attacks\u2014one on Tel Aviv and another on Eilat\u2014using hypersonic missiles and drones. Since October 2023, the Houthis have launched repeated missile and drone attacks on Israel and targeted 228 ships linked to or bound for Israel, citing solidarity with Gaza under Israeli military assault backed by the U.S. since October 7, 2023. In retaliation, Israel conducted 2,843 airstrikes and naval attacks on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, including a strike on a prison facility in Sana\u2019a on September 26, 2024, killing and wounding many. Houthi officials stated that their military operations, totaling 1,679 attacks (missiles, drones, and naval vessels), serve as leverage in Palestinian negotiations. A senior Houthi political office member, Muhammad al-Bakhti, affirmed that their military actions are a tool of pressure and would be reactivated at Hamas\u2019s request. Another official, Muhammad al-Farh, praised Hamas\u2019s 'flexible, responsible, realistic, and implementable' response to the Trump plan. The Houthi leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, reported that their operations have involved 1,679 attacks and targeted 228 ships since the start of their support for Gaza.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 06:28 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a](https://www.alquds.co.uk/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A4%D9%83/)\n\n**Houthi Missile Attack on Israel Amid Peace Talks for Gaza**\nOn Saturday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intercepted a ballistic missile launched from Yemen by Houthi rebels, backed by Iran's regime, which activated air raid sirens in Jerusalem and central Israel. No casualties or material damage were reported, according to a brief IDF statement on X. The IDF urged the public to follow instructions from the Home Front Command. As a precaution, early warnings were issued across multiple regions, including parts of the West Bank. This attack follows a previous drone launch by the Houthi militia, part of a broader pattern of escalating pressure on Israel. The Houthis have targeted not only Israeli territory but also vessels linked to Israel in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Ad\u00e9n, in response to Israel's military campaign in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks. These actions have forced rerouting of international shipping, increasing logistics costs and worsening the global trade crisis. International naval forces, including the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, are actively protecting maritime traffic in the Red Sea, where several commercial ships have been sunk due to the rising hostilities. The attacks come amid ongoing peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas, with U.S. President Donald Trump proposing a peace plan that includes an initial withdrawal line in Gaza. On Saturday, Israel announced the deployment of an official delegation led by Minister Ron Dermer to Cairo for talks starting Monday, focused on Trump\u2019s plan for Gaza\u2019s reconstruction and future. After two years of war in Gaza, the possibility of an immediate ceasefire gained momentum following Trump\u2019s announcement that Israel had accepted the initial withdrawal line, and he urged Hamas to accept the conditions to achieve a ceasefire, release hostages, and free prisoners.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/10/05/mientras-avanzan-las-conversaciones-para-un-acuerdo-de-paz-en-gaza-los-huties-lanzaron-un-ataque-contra-israel/)\n\n**Flotilla: We Will Continue Sailing Toward Gaza**\nOn the evening of Wednesday, October 1, 2025, the Israeli military attacked the Global Sumud Flotilla, a peace and humanitarian mission composed of 44 vessels and over 400 activists, in international waters. The attack began around 20:00 with the interception of the flagship Alma, whose crew was arrested. By October 3, 2025, Israeli forces had intercepted 42 of the 44 ships, with the remaining vessels either delayed or captured. Morana Miljanovi\u0107, the only Croatian citizen on the flotilla and captain of the vessel Shireen, described the interception as illegal and labeled it a terrorist act, stating that 'intercepting ships in international waters is illegal, amounting to the kidnapping of civilians in international waters, thus a terrorist act.' She reported that communication between ships was disrupted 50 times between Wednesday and Thursday night, with Israeli forces conducting operations into the early hours. The Shireen, which had been serving as a legal observer, changed course and arrived safely in Cyprus by October 4. One vessel, the Marinette, was intercepted on October 3. Miljanovi\u0107 emphasized the flotilla\u2019s humanitarian mission, noting it carried aid to Gaza, and described the action as a collective, decolonial political statement beyond mere aid delivery. She also highlighted global mobilization efforts and confirmed a second flotilla of around ten ships was already en route to Gaza, aiming to break the blockade. Miljanovi\u0107 called on the Croatian government to uphold international law and cease supporting what she described as genocide, urging citizens worldwide to act collectively to resist normalization of the situation in Palestine.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[OBC Transeuropa](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Croazia/Flotilla-continueremo-a-navigare-verso-Gaza-240528)\n\n**Israeli Military Says It Intercepted a Missile Launched from Yemen**\nOn October 5, 2024, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported intercepting a missile launched from Yemen, prompting air defense alerts across areas including Tel Aviv. No casualties or property damage were reported. The Houthi movement in Yemen later claimed responsibility, stating it had launched a hypersonic ballistic missile targeting 'sensitive Israeli locations.' This attack occurred ahead of scheduled talks between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Egypt, set for October 6, focusing on the details of a prisoner exchange under the U.S. President Donald Trump's '20-point plan.' Although Trump claimed Israel had agreed to a 'preliminary withdrawal line' in Gaza, Israel conducted airstrikes on Gaza residential buildings that day, resulting in 18 deaths. Since the outbreak of the\u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e Israel-Palestine conflict in October 2023, the Houthi movement has attacked ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea and conducted missile and drone strikes on Israeli territory in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has responded with multiple airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. The Houthis reiterated that they would cease attacks on Israel only if Israel ends its military aggression and blockade of Gaza. On September 24, 2024, the Houthis launched a drone attack on Eilat, Israel\u2019s Red Sea coastal city, injuring at least 20 people. The following day, Israel conducted a large-scale airstrike on Sana\u2019a, the capital of Yemen, killing at least 8 and injuring 142.

Launched in July 2025 by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and organizations such as Global Movement and Maghreb Sumud Fleet during the Gaza conflict, the fleet comprises over 50 ships from more than 44 countries, making it the largest civilian-led convoy in history. The initiative stems from Israel's longstanding maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip since Hamas took control in 2007. Between 2008 and 2016, only 5 out of 31 aid ships attempting to break the blockade reached Gaza. The first Gaza Freedom Flotilla in 2010 was intercepted by Israeli forces, resulting in the deaths of 10 activists and dozens injured\u2014an event that drew international condemnation. Subsequent attempts in 2011, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2025 were similarly thwarted. In March 2024 to July 2024, a temporary sea corridor was opened between Cyprus and Gaza under the Safeena Operation, used by cargo vessels and the U.S. military. In March 2025, Israel imposed a three-month full blockade; in May, a flotilla was attacked by drones, and in June and July, other convoys were intercepted. The humanitarian campaign, led by the IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation and supported by groups like Free Gaza Movement and Viva Palestina, began in 2010 to deliver aid and draw global attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The campaign, with the slogan 'Our route is Palestine, our cargo is freedom,' attracted thousands of civil society organizations and activists worldwide. Supplies including medicine, medical equipment, cement, iron, toys, playground equipment, and school materials were loaded onto ships such as Defne Y, Gaza 1, and Mavi Marmara, departing from Istanbul on May 22, 2010. The Mavi Marmara, escorted by a farewell ceremony at Sarayburnu Port and carrying 560 passengers from 32 countries and various faiths\u2014including 50 foreign journalists\u2014sailed from Antalya Port on May 28, 2010. It joined five other ships in international waters off Cyprus, forming a flotilla bound for Gaza. On the night of May 30\u201331, 2010, Israeli forces sent threatening radio messages and launched air and sea harassment. Israeli commandos, using helicopters and Zodiac boats, attacked the fleet, deploying smoke and sound bombs before opening fire indiscriminately. Nine Turkish aid volunteers were killed, over 50 injured, and one, U\u011fur S\u00fcleyman S\u00f6ylemez, died four years later, raising the death toll to 10. Despite failing to reach Gaza, the flotilla succeeded in capturing global attention, symbolizing resistance and hope. The article concludes by quoting a poem by Yahya Kemal, affirming that these 'ships adorned with free horizons' will, as before, bring freedom to the people of Palestine and Gaza, and that this movement will inspire future generations of heroes.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 12:30 AM\nSource:[Yeni Akit Gazetesi](https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/yazarlar/ahmet-talib-celen/hur-ufuklarda-donanmis-iki-yuz-pare-gemi-50363.html)\n\n**Yemeni Minister Al-Iryani: Houthi Attacks on Maritime Routes Reflect Iran\u2019s Global Conflict, Not Gaza Crisis**\nYemeni Minister of Information, Culture, and Tourism, Dr. Muamar Al-Iryani, stated that recent regional developments, including events over the past 48 hours, prove that Houthi militia attacks on commercial ships and oil tankers in international maritime routes since November 2023 were not a response to the situation in Gaza as the militia claims. Instead, he asserted they are a direct reflection of Iran's broader conflict with the international community and a desperate attempt to demonstrate Iranian presence and influence in strategic sea lanes. In a tweet on X, Al-Iryani emphasized that the Houthi attack on a Dutch cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden on September 29\u2014shortly after the activation of the European 'Zand' mechanism and the end of the nuclear deal\u2014clearly indicates direct orders from Tehran, with the militia serving as an instrument of Iran to pressure and threaten the international community. He warned that as the Gaza war nears its end following President Donald Trump\u2019s announced plan and increasing international pressure on Iran and its proxies, the Houthi militia will face unprecedented political exposure, confirming their actions serve only Iran\u2019s 'Guardianship of the Jurist' project and not the interests of Yemenis. Al-Iryani concluded by calling on the international community, especially the European Union and the United Kingdom, to assume a historic responsibility by designating the Houthi militia as a terrorist group threatening regional and international security, and to take firm action to ensure the safety of maritime routes in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Aden, while supporting the legitimate Yemeni government in defending international waterways and Yemen\u2019s sovereignty, security, and stability.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 10:09 PM\nSource:[\u062d\u0636\u0631\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0646\u062a | \u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0646](https://7adramout.net/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7/)\n\n**Houthi Missile Attack Leaves Merchant Ship Unseaworthy; EU-Led Rescue Operation Successfully Evacuates Crew**\nOn October 5, 2025, the official X account of the EU's 'Aspides Operation' released footage of a rescue mission following a missile attack on the Dutch-flagged merchant vessel 'MV Minerva Grahat' on September 30, 2025. The ship, located 128 nautical miles southeast of Aden Port, Yemen, was struck by a ballistic missile-like object on September 29, 2025, according to the EU. The vessel, which had not requested protection from EU warships, caught fire and became unseaworthy. Upon receiving a distress call from the captain, the EU naval task force dispatched a rescue team and successfully evacuated 19 crew members\u2014comprising Russians, Ukrainians, Filipinos, and Sri Lankans\u2014two of whom were seriously injured. The operation involved naval vessels and aircraft from the Italian and Greek navies. The Houthi rebels claimed responsibility on October 1, stating the ship was targeted because it was classified as a vessel prohibited from entering ports in 'occupied Palestine'\u2014a designation tied to their solidarity with Hamas. The Houthis have been attacking ships they believe are linked to Israel, including those with only tenuous ties, prompting the EU, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India to deploy warships to escort merchant vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 09:12 PM\nSource:[\u4e57\u308a\u3082\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://trafficnews.jp/post/592178)\n\n**EU-GCC: Opening speech by High Representative Kaja Kallas at the High-Level Forum on Regional Security and Cooperation**\nAt the High-Level Forum on Regional Security and Cooperation, High Representative Kaja Kallas delivered an opening speech emphasizing the need for diplomacy and cooperation between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). She highlighted three key regional challenges: Iran\u2019s nuclear program, maritime security in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and the situation in Gaza. Regarding Iran, she noted that despite intensive EU diplomatic efforts during the 30-day snapback window triggered by France, Germany, and the UK, a resolution to extend the UNSC Resolution was not achieved; as a result, the EU will re-impose all previously lifted UN and EU nuclear-related sanctions without delay, while reaffirming that diplomacy must continue. On maritime security, Kallas condemned Houthi attacks on international shipping, including the sinking of two Greek cargo ships, an attack on a tanker, and an explosion on a Dutch-flagged vessel, stressing that such acts violate freedom of navigation\u2014a global public good. She highlighted EU Operation ASPIDES, which has protected over 560 vessels and monitored or supported another 600, with anti-air frigates deploying daily; the operation has been extended to February 2026, with further extension under consideration. She called for a coordinated regional approach, including strengthening the Yemeni Coast Guard. On Gaza, she acknowledged Qatar\u2019s direct experience of conflict spillover, including a strike on its sovereignty, welcomed the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s apology, and expressed support for President Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan, noting Hamas\u2019s announced acceptance.

In a statement, the Houthi government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that Palestinian resilience would force Israel to end its aggression, genocide, and the blockade of Gaza, emphasizing that Israel has failed to eliminate resistance or displace Gaza\u2019s population. The group criticized Israel for violating agreements with Hamas and Lebanon, while praising international support for Palestine. On October 5, 2025, the Houthis announced a successful military operation using a hypersonic, multi-warhead ballistic missile named 'Palestine 2' targeting sensitive sites in occupied Jerusalem, which reportedly caused mass evacuations of Israeli civilians. The Israeli military confirmed intercepting the missile, activating air raid sirens, and closing Ben Gurion Airport. This marks the first such deep Israeli strike by the Houthis since September 29, 2024, when they conducted two prior attacks\u2014one on Tel Aviv and another on Eilat\u2014using hypersonic missiles and drones. Since October 2023, the Houthis have launched repeated missile and drone attacks on Israel and targeted 228 ships linked to or bound for Israel, citing solidarity with Gaza under Israeli military assault backed by the U.S. since October 7, 2023. In retaliation, Israel conducted 2,843 airstrikes and naval attacks on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, including a strike on a prison facility in Sana\u2019a on September 26, 2024, killing and wounding many. Houthi officials stated that their military operations, totaling 1,679 attacks (missiles, drones, and naval vessels), serve as leverage in Palestinian negotiations.

The FDI stated they identified the missile launch from Yemen toward Israeli territory and that defense systems were working to intercept the threat, urging the public to follow instructions from the Home Front Command. As a preventive measure, the Israeli military issued an early warning that activated air defense sirens across multiple areas, including Jerusalem and southern Cisjordania. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sari confirmed the launch of a hypersonic, multi-warhead ballistic missile named 'Palestina 2' targeting 'sensitive objectives in the occupied Jerusalem area,' claiming the operation succeeded and caused 'millions of Zionist usurpers' to flee to shelters. Sari emphasized that attacks would continue until Israel ends its aggression against Gaza and lifts the blockade. This marks the 91st Houthi ballistic missile attack on Israel since March 18, 2024, when Israel resumed its military offensive in the Gaza Strip. The attacks have intensified since the outbreak of the current war between Israel and Hamas, following a temporary ceasefire agreement reached in January 2025. Prior to the truce, the Houthis had launched over 40 ballistic missiles and more than 100 drones and cruise missiles in support of Hamas.

Houthi attacks have disrupted shipping, with more than 100 drone and missile strikes on merchant vessels from 35 countries, prompting the U.S. to deploy a multinational naval task force. A December\u202f2023 UN\u2011brokered deal aimed to lift sanctions and reduce attacks, but the Houthis continued to target vessels, especially those linked to Israel, as a protest against the Gaza conflict. The attacks have caused a 9\u201110\u202f% global trade disruption, reduced Red Sea traffic to 60\u202f% (from 90\u202f% in 2023 to 36\u202f% in August\u202f2024), and pushed 586 container vessels to reroute in February\u202f2024.

The Gaza Strip is currently experiencing a severe famine and a humanitarian crisis, causing international concern. Yahya Saree, a spokesperson for the Houthi organization, stated in a televised interview, 'All ships that become targets will be attacked wherever our armed forces can reach them.' He added, 'As long as the invasion of Gaza stops and the blockade is lifted, all our military actions will immediately stop.' The Houthi organization has been attacking Israeli and Red Sea ships since the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which controls Gaza, began in October 2023. Prior to the attacks, over $2 trillion in global maritime trade passed through the Yemeni coast each year, with most ships passing through the Suez Canal and traveling between Europe and Asia. However, since the Houthi attacks began, maritime trade in the area has decreased by approximately 70%. Despite a decrease in attacks in 2025, maritime trade remains low. Israel has been blockading Gaza since March 2, leading to a severe famine in the area. In response to international criticism, Israel has increased its humanitarian aid to Gaza. This Sunday, the Israeli military temporarily suspended some military actions to allow a UN rescue convoy to pass through, and for the first time since March, restored electricity to a Gaza water desalination plant. The Houthi organization has previously attacked ships with ties to Israel, and this month, they sank two cargo ships, killing three crew members and detaining 11 others, the first deadly attack on commercial ships since November last year. Israel has also carried out several airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen in retaliation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: July 27, 2025 11:48 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6809/8900499)\n\n**The Red Sea: A Strategic Region Open to Further Escalation**\nThe Red Sea has seen a significant escalation in naval attacks by the Houthis since late 2023, using drones, precision missiles, and naval mines. These attacks have resulted in the sinking of commercial ships and the withdrawal of major shipping companies from the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, posing a real threat to global maritime security. In response, Europe launched 'Operation Aspides' in February 2024, led by France, to protect shipping lines in the Red Sea. However, the operation was characterized by a lack of capabilities and an evident failure to cover the extended route from Aden Gulf to the Suez Canal. As time passed, the mission's failure to deter the Houthis became apparent, particularly after they sank the 'TUTOR' and 'RUBYMAR' ships on June 12, 2024, marking a turning point in the maritime conflict. Meanwhile, the US announced the formation of a new maritime alliance, 'Guardian of Prosperity,' in December 2023, involving over 20 countries, to protect shipping in the Red Sea and Aden Gulf. However, this alliance focused on defensive protection without attacking Houthi sources of threat and did not achieve significant successes, making it more of a monitoring umbrella than an active alliance. In this context, former US President Donald Trump entered the scene, exploiting the escalating maritime threats in the Red Sea as part of his electoral agenda. In a June 2024 speech, Trump stated that if he were in office, he would respond strongly to the Houthis and use the maritime crisis as a bargaining chip against China in the tariff dispute, particularly since the closure of the Red Sea hinders Chinese goods' access to Europe through the Suez Canal (Bloomberg, June 2024). As the major powers continue to assert their presence in the Red Sea, Iran continues to bolster the Houthis with military and technological support. In May 2024, the National Resistance Forces, led by Brigadier General Tareq Mohammed Abdullah Saleh, announced the seizure of a shipment of advanced weapons en route to the Houthis through the Hodeidah coast, including military communication equipment and drone guidance systems. This operation highlights the ongoing Houthi threat, supported by Iran, through active maritime smuggling routes (Military Media, May 2024). Considering past experiences, the comparison between the current situation and the Somali piracy crisis in the Aden Gulf between 2008 and 2013 reveals a painful paradox. Back then, international coordinated operations like 'Operation Atlanta' and NATO operations successfully weakened Somali pirates through direct interventions, aerial surveillance, and rapid response. Today, despite the Houthis having greater capabilities and external support, the international response appears weaker and less effective (UN Security Council, 2013). As a result, companies like Maersk and MSC have announced shifting their routes from the Red Sea to the Cape of Good Hope, a longer and more costly route. This has led to a 30% increase in shipping costs, affecting fuel and commodity prices worldwide (Lloyd's List, June 2024). In this scenario, the Red Sea remains a strategic region open to further escalation unless a strong maritime alliance is reformed, one that goes beyond monitoring and aims to impose clear rules of engagement and dismantle Houthi attack platforms on Yemeni shores. In a short period, the Houthis sank two commercial ships, Magic Size and Internity Sea, and some crew members were killed, despite the US ceasefire on Houthi militias through Oman's mediation. The recent seizure of a shipment of advanced weapons by the National Resistance Forces, led by Brigadier General Tareq Saleh, highlights the presence of promising Yemeni ground capabilities, but they require international political, military, and intelligence support to face a threat that exceeds Yemen and the region, extending to global maritime security and the continued Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' policy of sending large quantities of advanced weapons and military equipment to the Houthi group, classified as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and many other countries.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 02:46 PM\nSource:[\u062d\u0636\u0631\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0646\u062a | \u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0646](https://7adramout.net/%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AE%D8%B6%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81/)\n\n**Houthi Insurgents Attack Cargo Ship in Red Sea, Leaving 4 Dead and 11 Missing**\nA cargo ship, the Eternity C, has sunk in the Red Sea after being attacked by Houthi insurgents from Yemen. According to the European Union's Operation \u00c1spides, four people are presumed dead and 11 are still missing. Ten people were rescued, including eight Filipino crew members, one Greek crew member, and one member of the ship's security team. The Houthi rebels have claimed to have taken some of the crew members, with the US Embassy in Yemen stating that they have been 'kidnapped'. This is the deadliest attack on a ship by the Houthi rebels, who have been targeting vessels in the critical maritime trade route, where over $1 billion in cargo passes through each year. The rebels claim to be attacking ships to support the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during the war between Israel and Hamas. 'It is recommended that all nearby ships remain vigilant', said the EU mission. The Houthi rebels have previously held crew members hostage, including those from the Galaxy Leader, which was seized in November 2023 and released in January 2024. Since November 2023, the Houthi rebels have attacked over 100 ships with missiles and drones, before halting their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the Gaza war. They have since become the target of a US-led bombing campaign, before a reported ceasefire was declared by US President Donald Trump.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 03:54 PM\nSource:[Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/11/habra-4-muertos-y-11-desaparecidos-tras-hundimiento-de-2do-barco-en-el-mar-rojo-por-parte-de-hutes/)\n\n**Houthis Resume Attacks on Commercial Ships in Red Sea**\nThe Houthi rebels in Yemen have resumed their attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, targeting two vessels in the past few days. This marks the first attacks on merchant ships in 2025, after a six-month hiatus. The Houthis, who are close to Iran, have targeted over 100 cargo ships off the coast of Yemen since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza 21 months ago. They claim to be acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Houthi leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi said that the new attacks were a 'confirmation' of their decision to target Israeli-linked ships 'as long as the aggression and siege of Gaza continue'. However, the resumption of these attacks sends several messages in the current context, according to analysts. 'Why now?' they ask. The Houthis say they want to maintain pressure on Israel, at a time when indirect negotiations are underway between Israel and Hamas. 'Negotiate with your heads held high, we are with you (...) until the siege is lifted and the aggression stops', said Houthi political leader Mahdi al-Mashat to the Palestinians. This escalation comes two weeks after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, in which the US also participated. The Houthis, who are part of the 'axis of resistance' against Israel led by Tehran, did not intervene in this conflict. However, the recent attacks are 'a reminder from the Guardians of the Revolution (Iran's ideological army) via their most important ally, that what has not been done (during the war with Israel) can, in case of repetition, be activated, at Bab al-Mandeb, Ormuz and Suez', three vital navigation routes for global trade, says Maged al-Madhaji, president of the Strategic Studies Center in Sanaa. 'What are the Houthis trying to prove?' they ask. The latest attacks were particularly violent, carried out using several boats equipped with rockets, as well as naval drones and missiles, according to maritime security agencies. Videos published by the Houthis showed their naval forces exploding and sinking the ships. With the weakening of other allies of Tehran within its 'axis of resistance' - the Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Hamas in Gaza - the Houthis want to show their 'regional and international strength', says Farea al-Muslimi, researcher at Chatham House. While the missiles fired regularly by the group on Israel have a limited impact, the disruption of traffic in the Red Sea, through which 12% of global trade passes, is 'a very effective way of bleeding the West', adds he. The Houthis are also trying to show that they have not been affected by the US bombings, which ended in May. These bombings have severely affected some of their military capabilities, but 'they still have a large stock and have quickly rebuilt their communication network', estimates M. Muslimi. According to Noam Raydan, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the Houthis have also taken advantage of the significant decrease in international military presence in the area. 'They now seem to have more room to harm navigation freedom', she says. 'What are the consequences?' they ask. The Houthis' attacks have already forced many shipowners to avoid the Red Sea, taking a longer and more expensive route. According to Noam Raydan, the transit through the Bab al-Mandeb strait has decreased by over 50% compared to 2023. 'After the recent attacks, ships belonging to companies whose other vessels dock in Israeli ports will have to either reconsider their route or seek military escort, especially from the European mission Aspides deployed in the area', but that 'mission has very few naval units in the region', warns the researcher. By threatening navigation freedom, the Houthis risk facing a resumption of US bombings, as well as new attacks from Israel. On Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the Houthis a 'threat to international peace, security, and economy'. 'Not confronting them will only worsen the problem', he said.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 11, 2025 12:42 PM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**Houthi Militants Attack Commercial Ship in Red Sea, Leaving Crew Missing**\nHouthi militants in Yemen continued to attack a commercial ship in the Red Sea, hours after launching an assault on the vessel that left the crew missing, the latest sign that the group is increasing its threat to merchant shipping. 'The ship has suffered significant damage and has lost all propulsion,' said the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) on Tuesday. 'The ship is surrounded by small boats and is under continuous attack.' The UKMTO warned ships to avoid the area after the incident, which occurred just weeks after the Israeli military conflict with Iran and the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza. The Red Sea is a crucial route for ships traveling between Asia and Europe via the Suez Canal in Egypt. According to the UKMTO, the attacks continued around 8:00 a.m. GMT, about 14 hours after the first incident was reported, which involved rocket-propelled grenades and the approach of several boats. Two people on board the Eternity C were injured and two others were missing, according to the ship's owner, Cosmoship. Jakob Larsen, director of security at BIMCO, the world's largest direct membership commercial shipping organization, said, 'These incidents highlight the Houthi's disregard for human life, as they continue to exploit sailors as pawns in their strategic conflicts.' The Eternity C was transporting cereals to Somalia for the World Food Programme and was attacked after completing its journey. The incident occurred about 51 nautical miles west of Hodeida, Yemen, and came after the Houthi militants claimed responsibility for a previous attack on a ship in the same area. The Houthi militants began attacking commercial ships in late 2023, claiming it was their response to the Israeli war in Gaza. Their actions led to the merchant fleet largely avoiding the area - and, by extension, the Suez Canal - and Stem Shipping suspended navigation through the route after the Houthi militants attacked the Sounion, a Greek oil tanker, in August last year, said Michael Bodouroglou, the company's CEO. The return of the attacks, especially given their severity, could once again deter more owners and crews from crossing the region and increase freight rates and insurance costs for transporters. 'I've personally heard of cases of ships being denied coverage,' said Corey Ranslem, CEO of Dryad Global, a maritime intelligence company. The United Arab Emirates said the Safeen Prism, operated by AD Ports Group, responded to a distress call from Magic Seas and rescued the 22 people on board.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 08, 2025 04:24 PM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo/2025/07/08/huties-de-yemen-atacan-barco-comercial-en-el-mar-rojo-buque-sufrio-danos-importantes-dice-reino-unido/)\n\n**Houthi Rebels Attack Greek-Managed Cargo Ship in Red Sea**\nA Greek-managed cargo ship, the Eternity C, was attacked by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, leaving two crew members injured and two missing. The incident occurred 50 nautical miles southwest of the port of Hodeida, Yemen, and is the second attack on merchant vessels in the Red Sea since November 2024, according to the EU's Operation Aspides. The ship, which was carrying a 21-person Filipino and Russian crew, as well as armed guards, was hit by drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from fast boats. The bridge was damaged, communication systems were disrupted, and the crew was ordered to abandon ship, although the lifeboats had been destroyed during the attack. The ship, which was carrying no cargo and suffered significant structural damage, was left listing and adrift. Yahya Sarea, the Houthi military spokesperson, confirmed that the attack was a response to alleged violations of the blockade of 'occupied Palestinian ports,' referring to Israel. He stated that Houthi forces will continue to attack vessels associated with Israeli interests navigating the region, as long as the war in the Gaza Strip continues. Since the start of the conflict in Gaza in October 2023, the Houthis, backed by Iran, have intensified their attacks in the Red Sea against ships associated with Israel and have also attacked US and UK targets in retaliation for the bombings carried out by these countries in Yemen. The violence in one of the main international maritime routes is a concern for the impact on navigation and global trade security in the region. Since November 2024, the Red Sea maritime corridor has seen a growing number of attacks directed against merchant vessels, especially those linked to Greek, Israeli, and Western companies, according to UKMTO and the EU's Operation Aspides. The Houthi rebels have employed a wide range of tactics and armament, including explosive drones, ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as unmanned and fast boats, which has raised the risk for navigation and made it difficult to protect commercial ships in the area. Only in the first months of 2025, European and maritime authorities have counted more than 20 similar armed incidents, resulting in severe damage or sinkings of several grain and oil tankers.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 08, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/07/08/un-barco-quedo-a-la-deriva-en-el-mar-rojo-tras-un-ataque-de-rebeldes-huties-hay-dos-marineros-heridos-y-dos-desaparecidos/)\n\n**Houthi Group Claims Responsibility for Sinking of Cargo Ship 'Magic Size' in Red Sea**\nThe Houthi group, backed by Iran, announced on Monday that a cargo ship, 'Magic Size', which they attacked with rockets and speedboats on Sunday, has sunk in the Red Sea. This is the first attack by the group on maritime shipping routes since the start of the current year. The Greek shipping company, Steam Shipping, which operates the ship, told Reuters that it has not been able to confirm the sinking of the ship from independent sources. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack and said they allowed the 19-member crew to leave the ship. Steam Shipping said that a commercial ship rescued all crew members and they are expected to arrive in Djibouti later on Monday. The ship was carrying iron and fertilizer from China to Turkey. The attack ended six months of calm in the Red Sea, one of the world's most used shipping routes, where Houthi attacks from late 2023 to late 2024 disrupted shipping between Europe and Asia through the Suez Canal. The Houthis have launched over 100 attacks on ships in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which connects them, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians after the war in Gaza in 2023. However, these attacks stopped this year, with the last ones recorded in December. Israeli attacks The Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said in a statement broadcast on television that the ship was targeted on Sunday after naval forces issued warnings that were ignored by the ship's crew. He added that the ship was targeted using two speedboats, five rockets, and three drones. The British Maritime Trade Operations and the security firm 'Amber' said in two reports that eight small boats attacked the ship initially with gunfire and rocket fire, before a security team on board the ship returned fire. 'Amber' said in a separate warning that the ship was later attacked by four speedboats and rockets, and added: 'Two of the naval units collided with the ship, causing damage to its cargo.' The British Maritime Trade Operations said the attack led to a fire on the ship. Meanwhile, the Israeli army announced on Monday that it had bombed three Houthi-controlled ports. There was no indication that the Israeli attacks were related to the maritime attack. During their attacks, the group sank two ships, seized another, and killed at least four sailors, disrupting global shipping and forcing companies to change their routes, which prompted the United States to intensify its attacks on the group last year. In June, tensions escalated in the region following a 12-day war between Israel and Iran, which was joined by Washington with airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. President Donald Trump had announced a halt to US attacks on the Houthis, saying the group had agreed to stop disrupting critical shipping routes in the Middle East.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 07, 2025 01:15 PM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/aswaq/economy/2025/07/07/%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%A4%D9%83%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B9-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%83-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B1)\n\n**Shipping in the Red Sea Increases by 60% Since August 2024**\nThe number of commercial ships passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait has increased by 60% since August 2024, according to Admiral Vasilios Gribaris, citing the decrease in missile and drone attacks by the Houthis and the signing of a ceasefire agreement between the US and the armed group. However, Gribaris noted that shipping activity, which had dropped to 20-23 ships per day in August last year, is still below the previous average of 72-75 ships per day before the Houthis launched their attacks in the Red Sea in November 2023 in support of Palestinians during the Israeli war in Gaza. The mission to protect shipping in this strategic waterway, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Asian Gulf through the Suez Canal, was established and extended in February to include tracking illegal arms shipments and monitoring ships carrying Russian oil subject to sanctions. Gribaris explained that the last attack on a commercial ship occurred in November 2024, and that the Houthis have narrowed their targets, confirming that their attacks are limited to Israeli ships or those related to Israel or docked in Israeli ports. He added, 'If the ship does not meet these criteria... there is a high probability \u2013 exceeding 99% \u2013 that it will not be a target for the Houthis.' However, Gribaris emphasized that he cannot provide a guarantee against commercial ships being attacked. He pointed out that some companies have hesitated to use this route due to the shortage of ships assigned to the mission, which may lead to delays of up to a week for ships that require escort. He explained that the mission operates with two to three ships at the same time and has requested that the EU provide it with ten ships to enhance its ability to provide protection. The mission has provided direct protection to 476 ships, shot down 18 drones, destroyed two remotely controlled boats used in attacks, and intercepted four ballistic missiles.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 08:44 PM\nSource:[hapijournal.com](https://hapijournal.com/2025/06/05/%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%af%d8%b3-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%ad%d8%a9-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a8%d8%ad%d8%b1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%ad%d9%85%d8%b1-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%aa%d9%81%d8%b9-60/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that the probability of Maersk resuming shipping operations in the Red Sea during 2025 is low. Their consensus emerges from the following core observations and analyses: Recent months (especially September-October 2025) have seen persistent, lethal Houthi attacks on commercial shipping\u2014including ship sinkings, fatalities, and ambiguous targeting logic that threatens even vessels not clearly linked to Israel. Despite robust international naval operations (EU ASPIDES, US-led escorts), protection capacity is limited, and attacks continue to occur, undermining confidence in safety for large, risk-averse companies like Maersk. Insurance coverage for Red Sea transit remains either unavailable or prohibitively expensive, and Maersk\u2019s legal and reputational risk tolerance means their Board and safety committees will require a sustained period of calm and risk reduction before even a partial resumption\u2014a standard that has clearly not been met as of October 2025. Precedents from past maritime crises (e.g., Somali piracy) show major global shippers only resume after several months of demonstrated safety, widespread insurer re-entry, and effective military suppression, none of which are present in the current Red Sea environment. Although diplomatic moves around Gaza (e.g., a Trump peace plan, tentative acceptance by Hamas) might in theory lead to a de-escalation, experts find little evidence an imminent, durable ceasefire or Houthi stand-down will materialize and be sustained before the year\u2019s end. While the question would resolve YES even for a partial or escorted resumption, experts find this scenario plausible only with a rapid, dramatic and sustained improvement in security and political climate\u2014an outcome deemed highly improbable given persistent attacks and vague Houthi criteria for targeting. Final individual probability estimates for a YES outcome range from 7% to 20%; most cluster below 15%. The clear majority expectation is that Maersk will not resume (nor announce resumption of) Red Sea shipping before January 1, 2026, absent a surprising and rapid transformation of the regional security environment.",
