Several news sources report both intent and imminent timing for the removal of at least one listed official (Siebert). However, legal challenges and procedural delays (e.g., Lisa Cook at the Fed, ongoing litigation over probationary and SES firings) suggest the administration often fails to technically remove individuals from office quickly enough to meet explicit criteria. The inclusion of 'announcement' in the resolution criteria materially raises the chance of a 'Yes' if the administration follows through (especially if a Friday, Sept 19\u201320 removal is both notified and confirmed publicly), but any ambiguities (e.g., whether Siebert remains \"in office\" pending reassignment or litigation) could still break for 'No'. With less than two weeks left and most priorities (besides Siebert and perhaps the aftershocks of BLS/DOJ removals) seemingly having cleared or stalled, likelihood is still modest\u2014but higher than pure base rate due to these specific signals.

This direct reporting, on top of a high-trust trend of rapid firings (especially for those perceived as non-compliant on politicized issues), meaningfully increases the odds above the low base rate. However, caveats must be considered: legal or procedural snags could cause the formal removal or its announcement to miss the September window, as seen in other instances (e.g., Lisa Cook remains in position despite 'firing'). While the probability for any individual to be out is modest, the negative correlation between being targeted and administrative friction is not perfect\u2014the move seems genuinely imminent for Siebert. Additionally, with over 90 officials listed, even a baseline chance compounded across the group raises the risk slightly\u2014though not to certainty, as bureaucratic inertia and court reversals remain significant headwinds. On net, the evidence for Siebert\u2019s departure, combined with ongoing administrative volatility, justifies modestly raising the probability well above the 24% baseline but stopping well short of a high-confidence prediction. The forecast is that the odds of at least one listed official leaving or being announced out before October 1, almost exclusively because of Siebert, are roughly 55%.",

The elite-purge dynamic, especially amidst ongoing policy battles, loyalty tests, and high political stakes, raises the risk above historical norms. Media reports specify the impending removal of at least one official (Siebert, the U.S. Attorney), and there is clear precedent of ousted agency heads (BLS) in similarly compressed cycles. Conversely, several legal reversals (see Lisa Cook and mass firings of civil servants) reveal litigation can slow, nullify, or suspend ousters at the last moment, especially where Senate-confirmed positions are involved. Factoring in the question's narrow time window and the number of eligible individuals, and recognizing that even in an unusually aggressive administration, full-blown purges are matched by a countervailing wave of legal and institutional pushback, I estimate a moderately elevated but not extreme probability.

However, strong recent judicial interventions (particularly regarding illegal firings in February), agency walk-backs, and the very short time left (12 days) limit the probability that additional officials on this specific list will be out before October 1, unless processes are already in motion. The strongest positive evidence for a Yes is repeated, high-confidence reporting that DOJ officials (Siebert) are about to be removed, sometimes with explicit administrative intent to announce or execute firings imminently. While overall turnover base rates are substantially higher under this administration and the political environment remains unstable, the combination of legal constraints, procedural inertia, and absence of already confirmed departures since September 14 reduces the probability, but does not eliminate substantial risk. In light of all evidence\u2014and with an expert eye on the interplay of political imperatives and bureaucratic constraints\u2014the forecast remains slightly below the base rate for turnover in Trump\u2019s team in similar short time frames, but elevated above the historic norm for stable periods.

While Trump\u2019s principal-agent approach greatly increases the risk of further terminations\u2014especially of perceived disloyal officials\u2014the very short resolution window (11 days), the litigation drag on many cases (such as Lisa Cook\u2019s), and the quieting of public firings in the past ten days together suppress the immediate risk. Still, rumors and emerging signs of tension around several agency heads suggest some base risk should linger, especially given Trump's impulsive style. Base rates of high-level turnover in turbulent administrations suggest a non-trivial risk, but the time constraint and lack of clear targets for immediate action temper this.

This cycle, the scale of attempted firings is even greater, although actual full legal and public removals lag behind announcements in many cases. Judicial resistance, court injunctions (notably on mass firings and high-visibility removals like Lisa Cook), and the resiliency of administrative process slow the implementation of even explicitly announced purges. Most of the individuals reported as on the chopping block are either in ongoing legal limbo or not yet successfully ousted. However, breaking news indicates Erik Siebert is highly likely to be removed in the imminent days, and the pattern of repeated, publicized action at the top level (Labor Statistics, US Attorneys) increases the probability that at least one departure will cross the legal and public threshold in the 11-day window. Taking into account: (1) aggressive regime behavior, (2) one or more imminent, highly specific threats likely to resolve within the period, (3) the countervailing drag of process/legal obstacle, and (4) a very short time window, I land somewhat above prior base rates but short of extremity\u2014a little above the bold starting probability.

Contemporary succession and removal procedures\u2014especially for Senate-confirmed positions\u2014provide officials with multiple layers of administrative and legal insulation that frequently delay, obscure, or complicate official acknowledgment of removal. High-frequency removal news in this administration regularly precedes, but does not immediately correspond with, formal out-of-office status: Lisa Cook's situation illustrates how even high-profile firings can take weeks or months to legally consummate. Similarly, the 'announced out' clause does theoretically lower the bar for a YES, but agencies sometimes temporize, announcing 'intent to remove' or 'pending review,' which may not meet the test used by arbiters who require unmistakable, publicized departure or imminent resignation. With less than two weeks remaining and a fragmented, lawsuit-heavy environment, assigning a 55% probability rather than a sub-33% estimate discounts the serious drag imposed by procedural and legal inertia. The probability that a plausible removal rumor fails to cross the decisive threshold by October 1 is not trivial, even when threat signals are strong."

Even with clear signs that the administration is moving against an individual such as Siebert, precedent shows procedures may delay removal past the end of September. The forecaster wisely resists the temptation to overshoot on recency or media noise and instead grounds the probability in the longer-term dance between presidential initiative and institutional resistance. This caution is warranted, since outside events, litigation strategies, and last-minute hold-ups are all disproportionately likely in politically fraught, legally contested removals, making a moderate rather than high probability a more robust forecast."

The Siebert removal scenario, though news-validated, depends critically on (a) whether his office is among those strictly listed in the Fine Print, and (b) whether any impending removal will be formally completed or unmistakably announced within the 12-day window. Elite Theory suggests that, while personalist leadership styles increase the baseline for turnover, countervailing institutional and legal mechanisms frequently cause announced firings to become protracted affairs (e.g., Cook at the Fed), and this dynamic is intensified by ongoing litigation and press scrutiny, which slow administrative moves at the margin. Furthermore, in highly salient moments, organizations often respond with procedural obfuscation to avoid negative headlines, pushing removals just beyond risk windows. The move from a cautious 24% to 36% is arguably insufficiently discounted for these factors, considering that (1) most high-level removals\u2014even in active periods\u2014do not cluster within short windows, and (2) procedural drag has dominated similar recent cases.

The use of recent patterns\u2014where legal and procedural drag repeatedly stretches the lag from firing announcement to technical vacancy\u2014is methodologically solid. Additionally, this forecaster gives appropriate weight to the idea that for any given high-risk situation, marginal signals (like immediate publicized threats on Siebert) lift the probability, but not into the territory of near-certainty that would be reserved for events already underway and official.

Public administration's internal frictions\u2014especially union resistance, OPM and agency review, and headline-averse modes of bureaucratic risk aversion\u2014combine to keep short-term removal odds lower than news reporting might suggest. The point about rumors and tensions sustaining base risk\u2014but not leading to sharp spikes in realized action within a constrained period\u2014is well-executed.

Additionally, the 24% probability seems anchored too heavily to systemic inertia and base rate caution, risking a miss when the convergence of explicit presidential intent, media confirmation, and short-run calendar alignment coalesce. The resolution criteria's inclusion of public announcements lowers the hurdle for resolution to Yes\u2014a vital technical nuance\u2014increasing the effect size of administrative action that, under less visible circumstances, might not result in immediate legal separation.

While the inclusion of official 'announcement' language in the resolution criteria creates more pathways to a Yes, the ambiguous nature of such announcements (e.g., administrative 'intention to remove' vs. 'X is no longer in this role') introduces risk that a rumored removal could still fall short of clear resolution in the <2 week window. No forecaster brought convincing new positive evidence for an imminent or alternative removal beyond Siebert, nor did anyone show that the procedural and legal delays were less relevant than initially analyzed. Consequently, while the risk remains elevated versus long-run base rates due to identified imminent threats, there is insufficient evidence to justify a probability as high as 33-55%\u2014the risks and frictions are substantial. I therefore maintain my initial forecast at 24%: materially higher than stable-administration base rates, but not approaching a coin-flip.",

While Siebert's ouster is signaled as highly likely and announced removals are possible within the two-week window, the success of last-minute holds, the prevalence of 'pending' rather than definitive departure announcements, and the administrative caution shown in similar high-profile cases (e.g., Cook) all point to a non-trivial failure rate for such actions to clear the bar within the forecast window. The defense of a more moderate probability (as articulated by the Bureaucratic Politics Model) likewise reminds me that bureaucratic slowdowns are, under current conditions, a meaningful dampener. Therefore, although I still see 'Yes' as the single most probable outcome, I am revising my probability slightly downward to reflect the persistent risk that anticipated firings do not complete or are not cleanly announced in time.",

Critiques from the Executive Branch Succession and Political Science (Leadership Turnover) models both emphasize that, even under concerted threat, actual removals (as opposed to threatened or attempted firings) are regularly delayed, often by litigation or administrative ambiguity, as exemplified by the Lisa Cook case. The apparent increase in turnover hazard is real but is counterweighted by the specific, short time horizon and by strong institutional drag, supporting my initial base-plus adjustment. While one forecaster favored an elevated estimate on the basis of Siebert's situation and group risk aggregation, consensus and critique highlight that unless a clear public announcement or official removal occurs within days, the default outcome remains 'No.' Given all input, a moderate 24% remains the most robust probability.",

Critiques highlight the danger of overweighting 'intent' or media-reported firings versus formal completion or announcement, especially because actual, question-resolving departures have lagged high-frequency rumor and presidential rhetoric repeatedly in recent months. No new evidence or argument moved the probability above my original 36%. However, the group consensus and well-made critiques of over-adjustment to short-window news make clear that an even more moderate estimate (closer to 30%) is most robust to these countervailing risks. My revision therefore modestly decreases the probability to 30% to better reflect the continued procedural drag and legal uncertainty still facing ostensible departures, even in the face of strong removal signals. This places my forecast just above pure base-rate, in line with the modal group view and consistent with turnover model evidence.",

The arguments for higher probability rest on repeated news corroboration and the base rate-magnifying effect of having over 90 officials listed. However, closer examination\u2014especially critiques highlighting the difference between intent/announcement and actionable removal, as well as historic instances where high-risk firings (e.g., Lisa Cook) were delayed for weeks or indefinitely by litigation\u2014strongly reinforce the original view. The Siebert scenario appears more vulnerable to delay or 'pending' language than first reported. Additionally, multiple forecasters with different theoretical backgrounds converge around base- or slightly above base-rate estimates, underscoring the stability of the underlying procedural inertia. Thus, while the risk is not negligible and a surprise removal remains possible, the probability remains best placed at a cautious 24%. I see no compelling, additive new information that would move the estimate higher or lower in light of the debate.",

The deliberation revealed consensus among several domain experts that, despite high-profile threats and a pattern of volatility, the formal removal (or public announcement thereof) of a listed official within the very narrow 11-day window remains unlikely. Multiple forecasts (across Executive Succession, Bureaucratic Politics, and Elite Theory perspectives) noted the bottleneck created by legal and procedural inertia, as evidenced by ongoing litigation and the lag between 'intent' to fire and actual, resolvable departure. While the Political Risk forecaster made a case for a higher probability (55%), this relies on imminent threat translating directly to resolved removal\u2014which, as critiqued, is not reflective of recent empirical patterns in such high-stakes and contested situations. The ensemble tendency is toward moderation, stressing the gap between removal signals and actual outcomes for listed officials.

First, the strongest positive signal for a Yes remains the cluster of news reports about an impending removal of US Attorney Erik Siebert, with language indicating the removal is 'expected by Friday.' However, other forecasters (notably in US Federal Government Affairs and Public Administration) convincingly emphasized the persistent drag of procedural and legal friction\u2014especially for high-profile, Senate-confirmed positions. This is particularly salient given Lisa Cook's situation and the documented use of ambiguous or delayed 'announcements,' which may or may not meet the question's explicit resolution criteria. Crucially, discussion highlighted that the hurdle for a Yes is not simply internal intent or informal communication, but a fully public, agency-level or employer announcement\u2014something that historically, even aggressive administrations sometimes fail to deliver within short windows amid controversy. Still, discounting the Siebert threat too much would ignore a meaningful, specific signal, albeit one locked in a noisy, litigation-prone environment. I see value in a modest upward revision, given the notable evidence that at least one removal process is moving unusually quickly and in public. I am not swayed to match the highest estimate (55%), as that underweights historic lag and ambiguity, but consensus and deliberation justify a gentle nudge higher.",

The judge\u2019s permanent decision, while not ordering reinstatement, required OPM and the affected agencies to remove any derogatory references to the dismissals and to send formal letters to each worker stating the firings were revoked. The ruling followed a preliminary injunction that had been halted by the Supreme Court. AFGE President Everett Kelley said the decision was 'another significant victory for federal employees and for all Americans,' and praised the judge for exposing the \u2018sham record\u2019 used to justify the firings. AFSCME President Lee Saunders echoed the sentiment, noting the relief for members and the broader impact on public services. The firings, carried out between Feb.\u202f12\u201117 via a standardized OPM form letter, targeted 25,000 workers across agencies including Veterans Affairs, Energy, Defense, Agriculture, Interior, Treasury, the FAA, and others. Judge Alsup noted that OPM had directed agencies to terminate employees except those in 'mission\u2011critical' roles or exempted under OPM approval, a directive he deemed unlawful. The case also highlighted exemptions: the Justice Department sought relief for 10,485 workers, and the National Transportation Safety Board argued that cutting even 30 probationary workers would jeopardize investigations such as the Baltimore Harbor bridge collapse and the fatal Army helicopter crash near Washington National Airport, which involved 13 probationary investigators. The unions described the firings as 'one of the most massive employment frauds in U.S. history.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:13 PM\nSource:[People's World](https://peoplesworld.org/?post_type=article&p=152483)\n\n**Trump Deputies Shrink Asylum Loophole by 65 Percent**\nThe article reports that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has reduced President Joe Biden\u2019s asylum loophole by 65\u202fpercent, citing a 1.1\u202fmillion\u2011case backlog that is being processed more quickly.  According to the piece, Trump\u2011appointed judges in July\u202f2025 approved only 20\u202fpercent of asylum pleas\u2014down from 57\u202fpercent in October\u202f2023\u2014while rejecting 75\u202fpercent of claims, up from 45\u202fpercent in October\u202f2023.  In July\u202f2025, the judges heard 9,830 cases, compared with 6,237 in October\u202f2023, and granted asylum to 1,939 migrants versus 3,185 approved by Biden\u2019s judges.

First, whistleblower documents released to the Senate Judiciary Committee show that a Biden\u2011era FBI probe\u2014codenamed \u2018Arctic\u202fFrost\u2019\u2014targeted 92 Republican\u2011linked entities, including Turning Point USA, over a \u2018multifaceted conspiracy\u2019 to keep Donald\u202fTrump in power after the 2020 election. The investigation, begun in April\u202f2022 under Director Christopher\u202fWray, involved more than 150 interviews, over 400 subpoenas (300 for witness records, 200 phone selectors, 20 financial probes), and search warrants for 10 phones, 20 devices, seven iCloud accounts, 28 emails and even Trump\u2019s Twitter. Second, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome\u202fPowell announced a 0.25\u2011percentage\u2011point cut to the benchmark interest rate, the first reduction since December\u202f2024, citing a slight rise in unemployment and persistent inflation. Powell said, 'While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals and in light of this shift in the balance of risks, today the Federal market committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point.' The move lifted the Dow and S&P\u202f500 to record highs and is expected to be followed by similar cuts in October and December. Third, Secretary of State Marco\u202fRubio concluded a Middle East trip as Israel launched a ground invasion of Gaza City. Heritage Foundation VP Victoria\u202fCoates warned that the assault could complicate negotiations, noting that Hamas \u2018won\u2019t let them out\u2019 and that neighboring countries are blocking exits. The briefing also noted an Israeli airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, which the Qatari government condemned. The article cites Republican Senator Chuck\u202fGrassley, Democrat Senator Chuck\u202fGrassley, Powell, and Coates, but presents the events largely from a conservative perspective.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 06:45 AM\nSource:[The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/morning-brief-biden-targeted-tpusa-fed-finally-lowers-rates-israel-pushes-into-gaza-city)\n\n**Judge rules that probationary federal workers were fired illegally \u2014 AGU\u2019s plaintiff coalition prevails**\nOn September 15, 2025, a federal judge ruled that the Trump Administration illegally fired tens of thousands of probationary federal employees in February. The decision made permanent a preliminary injunction issued in April 2025. The court ordered the Office of Personnel Management to update personnel records to remove false claims that the firings were performance\u2011based and to refrain from similar actions in the future. The ruling covers agencies such as Agriculture, Commerce (including NOAA), Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior (USGS), Treasury, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, EPA, GSA, NSF, and SBA. Janice R. Lachance, Executive Director and CEO of the American Federation of Government Employees, praised the decision, saying 'We applaud the judge\u2019s decision and echo his striking rebuke against the clear illegality of OPM\u2019s actions,' and added 'This outcome shows that the destruction of the scientific workforce that is so vital to our health, safety, and national security is not inevitable.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 05:49 PM\nSource:[yubanet.com](https://yubanet.com/usa/judge-rules-that-probationary-federal-workers-were-fired-illegally-agus-plaintiff-coalition-prevails/)\n\n**Trump Officials Set to Remove US Attorney Over James Probe | Mint**\nAccording to the Mint article, Trump administration officials informed US Attorney Erik Siebert that he would be removed from his position because he did not prosecute New\u202fYork Attorney General Letitia James on alleged mortgage\u2011fraud charges. Siebert, who was nominated by President Trump in May and had served as interim US attorney since January, was asked to bring charges after the Justice Department\u2019s probe into James was triggered by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte\u2019s claims that she misrepresented her residence status on mortgage applications. The article notes that Siebert\u2019s office found insufficient evidence to charge James, and that he may continue working as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia after his removal. The piece also recounts that James won a $454\u202fmillion civil\u2011fraud case against Trump in 2024, a penalty that was struck down by a New\u202fYork appeals court in August but that upheld the finding that Trump inflated the value of his assets. Trump\u2019s administration, led by Justice Department official Ed Martin, targeted several Democrats\u2014including James, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and Senator Adam Schiff\u2014over mortgage\u2011fraud allegations; Cook was fired in August, sued Trump, and a federal judge allowed her to remain in office pending a Supreme Court ruling. Schiff, a long\u2011time critic of Trump, was pardoned by President Biden. The article presents these facts without overt editorializing, citing the actions of Trump officials and the DOJ\u2019s investigations as the primary sources of information.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 10:08 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/politics/trump-officials-set-to-remove-us-attorney-over-james-probe-11758319455156.html)\n\n**Report: Trump to oust US attorney who wouldn't charge Letitia James**\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to fire U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert because Siebert failed to find evidence that New York Attorney General Letitia James committed mortgage fraud. ABC News reported that Trump officials pressured Siebert to bring charges against James, but he did not. Trump has a history of animosity toward James, dating back to her successful lawsuit against the Trump Organization, which resulted in a $354\u202fmillion fine that was later overturned by a New York appeals court. The mortgage fraud investigation into James began in April after Bill Pulte, director of the Federal House Finance Agency, sent a criminal referral to the DOJ. Trump officials have accused James of falsely claiming her Virginia property was her primary residence on a 2023 financial document, a claim that would violate her legal requirement to live in New York as an elected official. Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'Letitia James, a totally corrupt politician, should resign from her position as New York State Attorney General, IMMEDIATELY,' and added, 'Everyone is trying to MAKE NEW YORK GREAT AGAIN, and it can never be done with this wacky crook in office.' Siebert was nominated by Trump in May, but the administration now plans to replace him with a U.S. attorney who will more aggressively investigate James. Democratic and liberal critics say the DOJ is being used to target Trump\u2019s political foes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-15114879/Report-Trump-set-oust-US-attorney-wouldnt-charge-Letitia-James.html)\n\n**Trump Plots to Fire Prosecutor for Failing to Charge His Nemesis**\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly planning to fire U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert of the Eastern District of Virginia after Siebert declined to bring criminal charges against New\u202fYork Attorney General Letitia James, whom Trump has accused of mortgage fraud.  According to ABC\u202fNews, the Trump administration asked the Department of Justice in April to investigate James for alleged mortgage fraud, but investigators found that James only listed the home as a primary residence on a limited power\u2011of\u2011attorney form that allowed her niece to sign documents on her behalf; loan officers who approved the mortgage did not consider the document, sources told ABC.  Despite this, the administration demanded charges, and after Siebert refused, officials warned him that Trump plans to fire him, potentially destabilizing the office.  Siebert, who has served as interim U.S. attorney since January and was nominated by Trump in May, is expected to leave by Friday.  The administration intends to replace him with someone who will pursue James more aggressively.  Trump has publicly called James a \"totally corrupt politician\" and urged her resignation on Truth Social, saying \"Letitia James, a totally corrupt politician, should resign from her position as New\u202fYork State Attorney General, IMMEDIATELY,\" and that \"Everyone is trying to MAKE NEW\u202fYORK GREAT AGAIN, and it can never be done with this wacky crook in office.\"  The DOJ is also investigating James for \"deprivation of rights,\" and Trump had stripped her of her security clearance in February.  The article notes that similar mortgage\u2011fraud claims have been directed at Sen. Adam Schiff and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, despite evidence to the contrary.  It also references the court case where the Trump Organization was found to have committed fraud by over\u2011inflating property values, resulting in a judgment for $364\u202fmillion plus interest, now about $527\u202fmillion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-plots-to-fire-prosecutor-for-failing-to-charge-his-nemesis-letitia-james/)\n\n**Government Workers, AFSCME cheer judge's ruling against Trump's firings**\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco ruled that the Trump administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) illegally terminated 25,000 probationary federal workers in February 2025.

Patel, a former aide to Donald Trump, was confirmed on 20\u202fFebruary\u202f2025 with 51 votes in favor and 49 against, a much narrower margin than the 90\u2011plus votes that secured his predecessors.  He has repeatedly defended his actions in high\u2011profile cases, including the investigation of Charlie\u202fKirk\u2019s alleged murder, where he announced a suspect on social media and released photos and videos despite agency recommendations.  Critics point to the mass exodus of FBI personnel\u2014about 5,000 employees fired or retired since Patel took command\u2014as evidence of a \u201cdeep state\u201d purge.  The former director of the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, Brian\u202fDriscoll, has sued the agency, claiming Patel knew the firings were possibly illegal.  Patel has also defended the handling of the Jeffrey\u202fEpstein files, asserting there is no credible evidence of a \u201cclient list\u201d and that the DOJ\u2019s July memo was accurate.  Trump has publicly praised Patel, calling him a \u201cbrilliant lawyer\u201d and a defender of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d  The article quotes Patel saying, \u2018No pienso irme a ning\u00fan lado,\u2019 and Maria\u202fPuerta Riera, a professor at Valencia College, stating, \u2018La principal credencial de Patel no es la idoneidad para el cargo, sino su lealtad al presidente.\u2019  The piece also notes that 5,000 staff have been dismissed, and that the agency\u2019s chief, Andrew\u202fBailey, was appointed as a deputy director on 15\u202fSeptember\u202f2025.

The investigation, begun in April\u202f2022 under Director Christopher\u202fWray, involved more than 150 interviews, over 400 subpoenas (300 for witness records, 200 phone selectors, 20 financial probes), and search warrants for 10 phones, 20 devices, seven iCloud accounts, 28 emails and even Trump\u2019s Twitter. Second, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome\u202fPowell announced a 0.25\u2011percentage\u2011point cut to the benchmark interest rate, the first reduction since December\u202f2024, citing a slight rise in unemployment and persistent inflation. Powell said, 'While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up. Job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals and in light of this shift in the balance of risks, today the Federal market committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point.' The move lifted the Dow and S&P\u202f500 to record highs and is expected to be followed by similar cuts in October and December. Third, Secretary of State Marco\u202fRubio concluded a Middle East trip as Israel launched a ground invasion of Gaza City. Heritage Foundation VP Victoria\u202fCoates warned that the assault could complicate negotiations, noting that Hamas \u2018won\u2019t let them out\u2019 and that neighboring countries are blocking exits. The briefing also noted an Israeli airstrike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, which the Qatari government condemned.

The Washington Post notes that agencies have \u2018extensive flexibility\u2019 in reassigning employees, and workers keep their pay grade, yet many now perform lower\u2011level work while earning high salaries.

At HUD, civil\u2011rights attorneys who had investigated housing discrimination were reassigned to defend the agency against complaints; one employee said, \u2018I\u2019ve never had a customer\u2011service job,\u2019 and added, \u2018And you\u2019re trying to force me to do what I\u2019m worst at.\u2019  Paul Osadebe, a longtime HUD civil\u2011rights attorney, said, \u2018[The reassignments are] another thing, in the long line of efforts, to get us to just quit and abandon ship,\u2019 when asked about the moves.

CNBC notes the revision was on the high end of Wall Street expectations, ranging from 600,000 to 1\u202fmillion, and that the adjustment was more than 50\u202f% higher than last year\u2019s and the largest on record since 2002. The article argues that the Biden administration\u2019s positive job\u2011growth narratives were misleading, implying the Fed should have cut rates earlier. It cites a Wall Street Journal quote that the revision could amplify worries about a weaker job market and notes that the Fed\u2019s next rate\u2011cut decision will be influenced by the new data. The piece frames the revisions as evidence of systemic problems with the BLS, calls for an overhaul, and suggests that Trump\u2019s decision to fire the BLS head was justified.

According to Reuters, many of these employees are women and people of color who have served for decades in Republican and Democratic administrations, often in positions unknown to the public. More than 20 employees who were listed on the 'watchlists' spoke to Reuters, revealing the impact on their lives. Some have increased security measures in their homes or avoided public appearances, while others have removed their personal information from the internet. Over half of them reported feeling anxious, with some describing their lives as 'quietly collapsing', and others experiencing depression and isolation. Reuters relied on legal documents, public records, and interviews with over 30 sources to track the transformation of 'American Accountability Foundation' from a research organization opposing President Joe Biden to a powerful tool in Trump's campaign to purge perceived 'internal enemies'. The organization targets professional employees who implement current government policies, not political appointees, and justifies this by claiming that many of them have liberal leanings and may be working in secret to undermine Trump's agenda, according to the organization's president, Tom Jones, who told Fox News in June 2024: 'These people want to remain invisible within the agencies, and we will expose them.' In response to Reuters, Jones defended his organization's work, stating that their goal is to alert employees who oppose Trump that they are being monitored. He said: 'We stand by our research, and our only regret is that more of these individuals did not leave their positions to be replaced by those who are committed to the American people's agenda.' Reuters reported that at least 88 employees have left their government jobs or been forced to take administrative leave. Some were fired during Trump's mass federal layoffs, while others left in fear of being fired or reassigned, and two have fled the country fearing for their safety.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 07:15 PM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/3519667)\n\n**Trump Fires Director of Bureau of Labor Statistics, Accusing Her of Manipulating Employment Data**\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered the immediate dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating employment data.

Trump stated, 'I have instructed my team to fire this politically appointed person by Biden, IMMEDIATELY.' He added, 'Important statistics like this must be just and precise; they cannot be manipulated for political purposes.' An analysis by CNN suggests that Trump defended McEntarfer's sudden dismissal, arguing that recent employment reports undermined his message of a 'new golden era.' The move has been seen as an attempt to align official data with a favorable economic narrative for his administration. However, this analysis emphasizes that this action, along with attempts to pressure the Federal Reserve, threatens to erode confidence in the country's economic institutions. William Beach, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, stated, 'The BLS is the best statistical agency in the world. Its numbers enjoy trust worldwide.' He added, 'However, I believe the president's attack on the commissioner and the office is undermining that infrastructure and could undermine that trust in the long term.' The latest employment report revealed a more somber picture than expected, with the US economy creating 73,000 jobs in July, according to the Department of Labor.

He ordered his team to 'immediately fire this politically designated person by Biden,' arguing that Americans need accurate employment numbers. Trump claimed that employment numbers have been manipulated to make Republicans look bad. 'McEntarfer says only 73,000 jobs have been created (what a surprise!). Similar things happened in the first part of the year, always with negative numbers,' Trump said. The July employment report showed that 73,000 jobs were created, while the market had projected 106,000 new jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%.

Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth, 'She will be replaced by someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like these must be just and accurate, not manipulated for political purposes.' Trump claimed that McEntarfer 'falsified' employment data before the November presidential election to help the chances of his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, there is no evidence to support Trump's claims. McEntarfer was confirmed as commissioner by the Senate in January 2024, with 86 votes in favor and 8 against. The White House released a statement saying, 'The long history of inaccuracies and incompetence by Erika McEntarfer, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics designated by Biden, has completely eroded the public's trust in the government agency responsible for disseminating key data used by policymakers and businesses to make important decisions.' The statement also claimed that the agency was plagued by technical errors and leaks of confidential information during McEntarfer's tenure. The order to fire McEntarfer comes amid a wave of mass firings of federal officials, sparked by Supreme Court decisions to overturn lower court rulings that had deemed the firings illegal. The departure of career officials has raised concerns about the quality of economic data, which has long been considered a benchmark. In early 2024, Trump's Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, dissolved two expert committees that worked with the government on economic outcome statistics. Lutnick also suggested eliminating the GDP report from the government, considering that 'all governments' have gotten entangled in the data. The July employment data shows that the labor market has begun to feel the impact of the volatile commercial policy of the Republican administration and, above all, the mass layoffs in the federal administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, a month in which 73,000 new jobs were created, far below the 110,000 expected by analysts and also below the numbers recorded since January. The slowdown in the market would give Powell arguments to decide not to lower interest rates, but it could also serve as ammunition for Trump to increase pressure on Powell.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 08:57 PM\nSource:[elpais.com](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-08-01/trump-despide-a-su-responsable-de-estadisticas-laborales-despues-de-que-publicara-una-desaceleracion-del-empleo.html)\n\n**Trump Fires Biden-Appointed Labor Official Over Employment Data**\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered the dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the federal official responsible for labor statistics, after the release of employment data showing a slowdown in job growth.

Trump accused the economist of manipulating employment figures before the 2024 elections to favor a victory for Kamala Harris, but presented no evidence to support this claim. He stated that under his leadership, the US economy is 'thriving'. McEntarfer, an economist and Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) since January 29, 2024, was nominated by Biden in July 2023 and confirmed by the Senate in January 2024. Trump claimed that McEntarfer 'manipulated' employment figures to favor Harris' electoral chances, stating that 'we need accurate employment numbers. I've ordered my team to fire this Biden-appointed official immediately. She will be replaced by someone much more competent and qualified.' Trump also stated that 'important numbers like this must be fair and accurate; they cannot be manipulated for political purposes.' McEntarfer has not commented on the news. The controversy comes after a report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday, which stated that in July, only 73,000 new jobs were created, a figure far below projections. Additionally, revisions to data from the previous two months show that the situation is much worse than thought. Although the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, the report notes that more people left the workforce.

Trump wrote on Truth Social, 'I just found out that the 'Employment Numbers' are being manipulated by a Biden appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of the BLS, who altered the numbers to benefit Kamala [Harris] before the election. This is the same office that increased the number of jobs in March 2024 by about 818,000 and again, just before the presidential election of 2024, in August and September, with 112,000.' Trump added, 'We need accurate employment numbers. I have already determined that she will be fired IMMEDIATELY and replaced by someone much more capable.' The president also criticized the revision of the employment numbers, saying, 'McEntarfer said that 73,000 jobs were added (a surprise!), but the most serious thing is the correction of 258,000 lost jobs in the two previous months. This has been happening constantly, always with negative numbers.

'We are not tracking federal workers placed on administrative leave or those who take voluntary buyouts.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 10, 2025 05:11 PM\nSource:[KESQ.com](https://kesq.com/news/national-politics/cnn-us-politics/2025/07/10/tracking-trumps-overhaul-of-the-federal-workforce-2/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters assessed whether any listed U.S. federal officials would be out of their positions before October 1, 2025, mainly weighing the Trump administration's established pattern of aggressive personnel removals against the constraints of legal, bureaucratic, and temporal obstacles. Nearly all forecasters highlighted that base rates for senior-level exits in a narrow 11\u201312 day window are historically low, even in high-turnover environments. However, they noted the Trump administration's willingness to pursue statement firings and ongoing loyalty tests, citing credible news reports of imminent removals\u2014specifically U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert\u2014as raising the risk relative to typical periods. Factors such as judicial challenges (e.g., Lisa Cook\u2019s contested removal at the Fed), procedural delays, and the need for official or employer-announced departures per resolution criteria were seen as strong counterweights, likely to reduce the probability of technically qualifying departures within the timeframe. Forecasters were split, with a majority assigning a probability of 24% (reflecting legal/bureaucratic drag and lack of confirmed eligible departures as of forecast time), while two gave raised probabilities of 33\u201336% (reflecting the ongoing administrative turbulence and immediate media signals), and one assigned a coin-flip probability of 55% based almost entirely on the direct reporting about an imminent Siebert ouster. Across perspectives, the strongest plausible 'Yes' scenario centered on Siebert or another well-publicized dissenter being officially confirmed out before October 1. Conversely, the most likely 'No' scenario relied on legal or administrative delays forestalling any definitive, public departure on the Fine Print list before the deadline. In sum: while most judges see the risk as substantially higher than in normal periods, procedural and legal inertia keep the consensus probability under 40%, but above the historical norm, with a minority view seeing the scenario as more likely than not.",
