The principal legislative trade seems oriented toward FEOC/fraud avoidance and deadline compression, with capping discussed but not headline priority, per recent public drafts and news.

The presence of large red-state clean energy investments, the preference for targeted restrictions (FEOC), and procedural moves to simply axe or phase out credits decrease the likelihood of explicit caps being chosen as the lever. However, a material risk persists due to strong deficit aversion, explicit Cato/Republican concern for fiscal discipline, and the ease with which a cap could be inserted in an omnibus or reconciliation bill as a compromise.

Historical base rates after initial large cost overruns indicate a high frequency of Congress capping previously-uncapped credits. Multiple news sources and policy analyses detail rapid reforms, eligibility tightening, and phaseouts, all of which are strong signals of fiscal retrenchment. However, a cap is not presently evident in public summaries, official legislative text, or expert commentary as of November 21, 2025. This means that while the probability of a cap being imposed is elevated relative to history/normal times due to the political context, the lack of direct reporting on enacted caps as of now limits how extreme my estimate can be. Weighted by these factors, my probability is higher than an even chance, but not overwhelming, as final budget acts or technical corrections could easily still push this through by year-end 2025.",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit is a tax credit ([IRS](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/advanced-manufacturing-production-credit)) for domestic production in the United States of [components](https://www.plantemoran.com/explore-our-thinking/insight/2023/09/understanding-the-section-45x-tax-credit-for-manufacturers) of clean energy, such as inverters for solar panels, blades of wind turbines, and electrode materials for batteries. 45X was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which had a goal of creating a thriving, rapidly-growing clean energy sector. The role of 45X is to help the upstream manufacturers, to help ensure that a rapidly-growing sectors such as solar would have the equipment it needed to meet demand, since tax credits boost after-tax profits and thus reduce the cost of capital.&#x20;\n\nWith solar manufacturing for example, a factory making a 2 gigawatts per year, considered a modest-sized plant, could generate an annual tax credit of \\$140 million, [according to Utility Dive](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/us-treasury-irs-releases-detailed-guidance-on-45X-clean-energy-tax-credits/702691/). With batteries, the credit [is worth](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-inflation-reduction-act-electric-vehicle-incentives-are-driving-a-u-s-manufacturing-renaissance/) \\$35 per kilowatt hour for cell manufacturing and \\$10 per kwh for module assembly. These 45X incentives spurred a surge in investments in clean energy component manufacturing; in the year following the IRA being enacted, the clean energy manufacturing sector announced over \\$140 billion in new investments, which was double the amount in the two years before the IRA's enactment.\n\nIn November 2024, Donald Trump was elected president, along with Republican majorities in the House and Senate, with the [aim](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-second-term-biden-climate-change-rcna126810) to \"maximize fossil fuel production\" according to a Trump campaign official, who added, \"Some of the price tags involved with some of these credits seem to be wildly understated... We\u2019d be looking to cut a lot of that spending.\"&#x20;\n\nAt the moment, 45X benefits are not capped, which has received criticism from groups such as the libertarian Cato Institute, which [wrote](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/budgetary-cost-inflation-reduction-acts-energy-subsidies):\n\n> Under section 45X(c)(6) of the IRS code (section 13502 of the IRA), the federal government will indefinitely subsidize 50 different \u201ccritical minerals.\u201d This includes high-volume production minerals such as aluminum, lithium, nickel, and cobalt. These subsidies, particularly in the context of rising demand for lithium-ion batteries used for EVs and energy storage, risk creating a compounding effect, where multiple subsidies stack across the supply chain. For example, in a \u201csolar plus storage\u201d context, taxpayers not only subsidize the solar energy production through the PTC, but also the battery through the ITC and the minerals that go into that battery via section 45X(c)(6).\n\nIn their budget reconciliation talks, Republicans are working on possibly imposing caps on 45X, [according to Axios](https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2024/11/05/the-iras-staying-power), which also reports that there is bipartisan support for preventing Chinese entities from receiving 45X credits. &#x20;\n\nOther criticisms of clean energy tax credits such as 45X have been about share purchases. For example, the progressive thinktank Governing for Impact  [has written](https://governingforimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IRA-Stock-Buybacks-PAM_templated_FINAL.pdf):\n\n> Without sufficient guardrails, a firm could use federal assistance to finance projects it had already planned to complete using private capital; those now-unallocated private funds could subsequently be directed toward share repurchase programs\u2014 effectively enriching shareholders at taxpayers\u2019 expense and undermining the IRA\u2019s objective of increasing investments in green technologies beyond the status quo baseline. The only way to ensure this two-step substitution does not occur is if firms refrain entirely from engaging in stock buybacks over the period in time in which they are benefitting from public subsidies. Moreover, research demonstrates that stock buybacks often come at the expense of innovation in the economy, which, again, is the law\u2019s overarching objective. Prioritizing applicants that commit to eschewing stock buybacks, then, offers a way for agencies to ensure that the IRA\u2019s statutory goals are fulfilled.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36825,\"question_id\":36259}}`",

The order mandates collaboration among over a dozen land and natural resource agencies to develop policy proposals by September 2026 for legislative consideration in 2027, aiming to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 and 90% by 2050\u2014targets established in a 2021 executive order by former Governor Kate Brown. The latest Oregon Energy Strategy prioritizes solar, wind, geothermal, wave energy, energy storage, and energy efficiency projects. Key actions include fast-tracking permitting for projects eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s clean energy tax credits, which expire December 31, 2027, and require completion by that date for up to a 50% credit. Kotek emphasized the need for faster grid upgrades and transmission corridor development, citing a ProPublica and Oregon Public Broadcasting investigation revealing that the Northwest lags due to decades of inaction by the federal Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), which has delayed grid modernization for nearly a century. Kotek called on BPA to fulfill its commitments and improve collaboration. The state plans to add 8 gigawatts of energy storage by 2045\u2014about 50% more than current capacity\u2014with nearly 7 gigawatts already in development, enough to power roughly 5.8 million homes. The Department of Environmental Quality and the Public Utility Commission will align Clean Fuels Program revenues with investments in transportation electrification, low-income communities, multifamily housing, and underserved EV charging areas. The Clean Fuels Program requires fossil fuel suppliers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil to reduce carbon intensity of fuels by at least 37% by 2035. Clean fuel producers can earn and sell carbon credits to offset emissions. Kotek also directed a 50% or greater reduction in fuel carbon intensity by 2040, encouraging biofuels and low-carbon alternatives. The Department of Administrative Services must transition state vehicle fleets to zero-emission models and report annually on combustion-engine vehicle purchases. The Department of Land Conservation and Development will propose changes to land use regulations to expand clean energy development and transmission corridors on public lands. Despite a projected $63 million budget deficit over the next 18 months, Kotek urged agencies to use existing resources and identify funding needs for the next budget cycle. The story was produced by Oregon Capital Chronicle, part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and donor coalitions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Washington State Standard](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/11/20/repub/gov-kotek-orders-state-agencies-to-move-faster-on-clean-energy-projects-electrification/)\n\n**Merz Government Unveils Industrial Electricity Price Plan with Investment Conditions**\nThe Merz-led federal government has unveiled a billion-euro package for a planned industrial electricity price, set to take effect in 2026. Energy-intensive industries\u2014such as chemicals, metallurgy, cement, battery and semiconductor production, and parts of paper, machinery, and raw materials sectors\u2014will benefit. The initiative, aligned with the EU\u2019s KUEBLL guidelines, will allow companies to pay only five cents per kilowatt-hour for half their annual electricity consumption. The federal government forecasts expenditures of 3.1 billion euros between 2027 and 2029, funded by the Climate and Transformation Fund. However, the program requires companies to reinvest 50% of the received subsidies into new or upgraded facilities that reduce grid costs, with implementation required within 48 months. The EU Commission mandates these conditions to ensure climate and energy goals are met. Industry leaders, including Philip Nuyken of the German Lime Industry Association and Christian Seyfert of the Industrial Energy and Power Industry Association, criticize the policy, arguing that limiting relief to half the consumption and tying it to investment requirements undermines competitiveness and operational flexibility. According to calculations by Handelsblatt, the actual effective price will be 7.25 cents per kWh\u2014only a 9% discount\u2014resulting in a modest, single-digit cost reduction. To encourage demand flexibility, the government will introduce a 10% bonus if at least 80% of investments support flexible electricity use. The plan must be finalized within the coalition and approved by the EU Commission, with retroactive payouts from 2026 expected starting in 2027.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 04:41 PM\nSource:[Fuldaer Zeitung](https://www.fuldaerzeitung.de/politik-und-wirtschaft/merz-regierung-bringt-industriestrompreis-auf-den-weg-doch-verlangt-gegenleistungen-von-betrieben-zr-94047885.html)\n\n**Electric Power Equipment and New Energy Industry Weekly Report: Yu Shu Technology Completes IPO Counseling, Tesla Expands Texas Factory for Optimus Robots**\nTesla plans to expand its Texas Gigafactory to include a dedicated production facility for the Optimus humanoid robot, with an annual capacity of 10 million units, expected to be operational by 2027, according to Teslarati on November 11, 2025. Yu Shu Technology has completed its IPO\u8f85\u5bfc (pre-IPO counseling) as reported by the China Securities Regulatory Commission's online platform on November 15, 2025, with the report issued by Zhejiang CBIRC, placing the company in the acceptance verification phase. The National Energy Administration issued guidance on November 12, 2025, promoting integrated development of new energy, aiming for new energy to become a key development model by 2030, with enhanced reliability and market competitiveness, supporting China\u2019s green transformation and modernization. The National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration jointly released a guidance on November 10, 2025, on new energy absorption and regulation, targeting a coordinated, multi-level system by 2030 to ensure smooth grid connection, diversified utilization, and efficient operation of new energy, with new electricity demand primarily met by new renewable generation. By 2030, the system\u2019s adaptability to new power systems will significantly improve, and cross-provincial and cross-regional renewable transactions will be smoother, supporting the annual absorption of over 200 GW of new renewable capacity to aid carbon peak goals. Price tracking shows that polysilicon prices remained stable at 52.0 yuan/kg for dense material and 50.0 yuan/kg for granular silicon, with weak market stability and low willingness to cut prices due to downstream pressure. Silicon wafer prices declined by 3.7% for 182-183.75mm N-type and 3.0% for 210mm N-type, driven by weak demand, compressing margins and leading to reduced production forecasts for November. Battery cell prices dropped 1.6% for 182-183.75mm N-type and remained flat for 210mm N-type, with reduced procurement and a shift toward larger formats increasing pricing pressure. Module prices held steady across all types\u2014TOPCon, HJT, and BC\u2014despite cost reductions, with no price cuts due to weak domestic demand and strong overseas demand; November module production is expected to decline by about 3%. Glass prices remained flat at 20 yuan/\u33a1 for 3.2mm coated glass and decreased 1.6% to 12.3 yuan/\u33a1 for 2.0mm coated glass. Investment recommendations highlight BC technology (Aiko, Longi), supply-side (Daquan Energy, Foltex), solar-storage (Sunway, Deyue), power marketization (Langxin), domestic substitution (Shiquan), overseas expansion (Hengdian East Magnetic, Bowei Alloy), and suggest monitoring companies like GCL, Tongwei, Xinyi, TCL Chonghuan, Xin Te, Dier Laser, Fosun, Jinko, Trina, Maiwei, Jingsheng, Hongyuan.

This growth is driven by rising global demand for clean energy, supported by environmental urgency, climate commitments such as the Paris Agreement, and national net-zero targets. Government policies, including feed-in tariffs, tax credits (e.g., the U.S. Investment Tax Credit), renewable energy certificates, and net metering, are key enablers. Technological advancements have reduced costs per watt and increased efficiency, with mono-SI (monocrystalline silicon) modules leading in adoption. Post-COVID, demand for energy resilience and backup power has accelerated investment in off-grid and hybrid solar systems. Despite strong growth, challenges include supply chain bottlenecks due to dependency on critical materials like polysilicon and silver\u2014mostly sourced from China\u2014and regulatory inconsistencies in developing regions. End-of-life management and recycling of solar modules also pose environmental concerns. Regionally, North America leads in 2023, driven by U.S. incentives and strong residential and utility-scale adoption; Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing, led by China\u2019s dominance in production and installation under its 14th Five-Year Plan, with India, Japan, and Australia expanding rooftop programs. Europe is advancing through the EU Green Deal and REPowerEU, aiming to reduce reliance on Russian gas. Latin America and MEA (Middle East and Africa) are growing via solar farms in Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa, supported by public-private partnerships and declining costs. Market segments include Mono-SI, Multi-SI, CDTE, CIGS, A-Si, and emerging technologies like perovskite. Applications span utility-scale PV power stations, commercial buildings, residential rooftops, and off-grid uses. Key players include JinkoSolar, LONGi, JA Solar, First Solar, Canadian Solar, Trina Solar, Hanwha Solutions, Risen Energy, Seraphim, Shunfeng, GCL-Poly, LG Electronics, and Panasonic. Strategic opportunities include bifacial and transparent modules, IoT/AI-integrated smart solar systems, battery storage hybrids, solar-powered green hydrogen, and solar-integrated building materials. The market is expected to be a cornerstone of global energy infrastructure in the climate action decade.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2025 04:55 AM\nSource:[Taiwan News](https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6247635)\n\n**The AI revolution has a power problem - kuwaitTimes**\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged on a podcast with OpenAI's Sam Altman that the primary challenge in the AI revolution is not a shortage of computing power, but rather the availability of sufficient electrical power and the speed of infrastructure deployment near energy sources. Tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Meta are investing approximately $400 billion in 2025 and even more in 2026 to build the data center infrastructure needed for AI, accelerating in-house chip production to compete with Nvidia. However, constructing data centers takes an average of two years in the U.S., while new high-voltage power lines require five to ten years to become operational. Virginia\u2019s Dominion Energy now has a data center order book of 47 gigawatts\u2014equivalent to 47 nuclear reactors\u2014up from 40 gigawatts a year prior. Data centers could consume 7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, according to studies. Some experts, like Jonathan Koomey from UC Berkeley, caution that projections may be inflated due to incentives from utilities and tech firms to promote growth; many proposed data centers may never be built. If growth materializes, a 45-gigawatt power shortfall could emerge by 2028\u2014equivalent to the consumption of 33 million U.S. households. In response, several U.S. utilities have delayed retiring coal plants, and natural gas\u2014currently powering 40% of global data centers\u2014has gained renewed favor due to its fast deployment. Georgia\u2019s utilities have requested approval to install 10 gigawatts of gas-powered generators, and companies like xAI and others are purchasing used turbines, including from aircraft, to accelerate deployment. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated in October that the greatest threat is not climate change, but losing the AI arms race due to insufficient power. Tech companies are downplaying past climate commitments: Google removed its 2030 net-zero pledge from its website in June. Instead, they are promoting long-term solutions: Amazon supports Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), Google plans to restart a reactor in Iowa by 2029, and the Trump administration announced an $80 billion plan to build ten conventional nuclear reactors by 2030. Additionally, hyperscalers are investing in solar and battery storage\u2014Texas plans to add 100 gigawatts by 2030. Google and Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink are also exploring placing AI chips in orbit, powered by solar energy, with Google planning tests in 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 07:40 PM\nSource:[kuwaittimes.com](https://kuwaittimes.com/article/35535/technology/the-ai-revolution-has-a-power-problem/)\n\n**Florida Public Service Commission Approves New Rate Agreement fo**\nOn November 20, 2025, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) approved the 2025 rate agreement between Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) and ten of thirteen intervenor groups in FPL's base rate proceeding. The agreement, effective from January 2026 through at least December 2029, establishes new retail base rates and charges, resulting in $945 million in annualized retail base revenue increases starting January 1, 2026, and $705 million starting January 1, 2027. FPL will receive base rate increases tied to solar generation projects entering service in 2027, 2028, and 2029, and battery storage projects beginning in 2028 and 2029, via a Solar and Battery Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) mechanism contingent on demonstrating economic or reliability needs. FPL\u2019s authorized regulatory return on common equity (ROE) is set at 10.95%, with a permissible range of 9.95% to 11.95%; if the earned ROE falls below 9.95%, FPL may seek rate relief, and if it exceeds 11.95%, any party with standing may request a rate review. The agreement maintains a 59.6% equity ratio in FPL\u2019s authorized regulatory capital structure and authorizes a rate stabilization mechanism (RSM) involving deferred tax liabilities, reserve amortization, and investment tax credit amortization for battery projects. Future storm restoration costs will remain recoverable on an interim basis, capped at $5 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours of residential usage during the first 12 months of recovery, with potential surcharge increases in subsequent years. FPL may also adjust base rates prospectively in response to federal or state corporate income tax changes, subject to FPSC review, and is permitted to implement tariffs for large load customers with new or incremental loads of 50 megawatts or greater and a load factor of at least 85%.

This represents a significant increase, with projections indicating annual subsidies could exceed 1 trillion won. The rise is attributed to growing imports of Chinese electric vehicles and domestic automakers' supply chain diversification strategies, including the adoption of Chinese batteries. In the same period, the global market share of Korean battery manufacturers (LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, SK On) dropped to 16.9%, down 3.3 percentage points from the same period in 2024, while Chinese companies' share rose to 79.0%, up 3.4 percentage points. Leading Chinese firms include CATL (36.6% market share), BYD (17.9%), CALB (4.8%), Gotion (3.7%), EVE (2.7%), and SVOLT (2.5%). Industry experts and lawmakers, including Rep. Jin Jong-oh of the People Power Party, argue that the current subsidy system fails to support South Korea\u2019s national strategic industry\u2014battery technology\u2014and urge a policy overhaul to prioritize domestic battery producers. They note that countries like the U.S. (via the Inflation Reduction Act) and India (via PLI incentives) have implemented protectionist measures to boost local production. Rep. Jin emphasized that using public funds to subsidize foreign batteries contradicts the government\u2019s stated goal of strengthening domestic industrial competitiveness and called for a comprehensive reevaluation of the subsidy framework.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 11:42 PM\nSource:[First-Class \uacbd\uc81c\uc2e0\ubb38 \ud30c\uc774\ub0b8\uc15c\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.fnnews.com/news/202511201342340010)\n\n**Florida Public Service Commission Approves Florida Power & Light's Rate Agreement Through 2029**\nThe Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) has approved a stipulation and agreement between Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc.

Known as the 2025 Rate Agreement, it establishes new retail base rates effective from January 2026 through at least December 2029. Under the agreement, FPL will implement annualized increases in retail base revenues of $945 million starting January 1, 2026, and an additional $705 million beginning January 1, 2027. The agreement includes provisions for base rate increases tied to solar power projects coming online in 2027, 2028, and 2029, and battery storage projects starting service in 2028 and 2029, subject to conditions under the Solar and Battery Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) mechanism requiring FPL to demonstrate economic or reliability necessity. FPL's authorized return on equity (ROE) on common equity is set at 10.95%, with a range of 9.95% to 11.95%. If the actual ROE falls below 9.95%, FPL may request a base rate reduction; if it exceeds 11.95%, any qualified party may request a rate review. The agreement maintains FPL's authorized regulatory capital structure at a 59.6% common equity ratio and includes a rate stabilization mechanism using deferred tax liabilities, reserve amortization, and investment tax credits from battery storage projects to help maintain the authorized ROE range. Storm restoration costs will continue to be recoverable on a provisional basis, capped at a $5 surcharge per 1,000 kilowatt-hours of residential usage during the first 12 months, with potential for additional recovery in subsequent years. The FPSC typically issues a final order within 20 days, and opposing parties may appeal within 30 days of that order. The approval is based on a press release and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In related news, NextEra Energy Inc. reported third-quarter 2025 results showing a strong earnings per share (EPS) of $1.13, surpassing the expected $0.98, but revenue of $7.97 billion fell short of the $8.15 billion forecast.

The state plans to add 8 gigawatts of energy storage by 2045\u2014about 50% more than current capacity\u2014with nearly 7 gigawatts already in development, enough to power roughly 5.8 million homes. The Department of Environmental Quality and the Public Utility Commission will align Clean Fuels Program revenues with investments in transportation electrification, low-income communities, multifamily housing, and underserved EV charging areas. The Clean Fuels Program requires fossil fuel suppliers like Chevron and Exxon Mobil to reduce carbon intensity of fuels by at least 37% by 2035. Clean fuel producers can earn and sell carbon credits to offset emissions. Kotek also directed a 50% or greater reduction in fuel carbon intensity by 2040, encouraging biofuels and low-carbon alternatives. The Department of Administrative Services must transition state vehicle fleets to zero-emission models and report annually on combustion-engine vehicle purchases. The Department of Land Conservation and Development will propose changes to land use regulations to expand clean energy development and transmission corridors on public lands. Despite a projected $63 million budget deficit over the next 18 months, Kotek urged agencies to use existing resources and identify funding needs for the next budget cycle.

Energy-intensive industries\u2014such as chemicals, metallurgy, cement, battery and semiconductor production, and parts of paper, machinery, and raw materials sectors\u2014will benefit. The initiative, aligned with the EU\u2019s KUEBLL guidelines, will allow companies to pay only five cents per kilowatt-hour for half their annual electricity consumption. The federal government forecasts expenditures of 3.1 billion euros between 2027 and 2029, funded by the Climate and Transformation Fund. However, the program requires companies to reinvest 50% of the received subsidies into new or upgraded facilities that reduce grid costs, with implementation required within 48 months. The EU Commission mandates these conditions to ensure climate and energy goals are met. Industry leaders, including Philip Nuyken of the German Lime Industry Association and Christian Seyfert of the Industrial Energy and Power Industry Association, criticize the policy, arguing that limiting relief to half the consumption and tying it to investment requirements undermines competitiveness and operational flexibility. According to calculations by Handelsblatt, the actual effective price will be 7.25 cents per kWh\u2014only a 9% discount\u2014resulting in a modest, single-digit cost reduction. To encourage demand flexibility, the government will introduce a 10% bonus if at least 80% of investments support flexible electricity use. The plan must be finalized within the coalition and approved by the EU Commission, with retroactive payouts from 2026 expected starting in 2027.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 04:41 PM\nSource:[Fuldaer Zeitung](https://www.fuldaerzeitung.de/politik-und-wirtschaft/merz-regierung-bringt-industriestrompreis-auf-den-weg-doch-verlangt-gegenleistungen-von-betrieben-zr-94047885.html)\n\n**Indonesia's energy transition could be turbocharged by Chinese green finance, study finds**\nA study released as Indonesia submitted its second nationally determined contribution (NDC) finds that Chinese green finance could significantly accelerate Indonesia's energy transition. President Prabowo Subianto has set an 8% economic growth target and a goal of 100% renewable energy by 2035, requiring rapid financing scale-up. Indonesia currently has only 560 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity, compared to 198 gigawatts (GW) added in China in the first five months of 2025. Indonesia receives about US$900 million annually in energy financing from China. Redirecting this funding entirely into renewable energy over the 2025\u20132034 electricity supply plan (RUPTL) period could mobilize up to IDR144 trillion (US$9 billion), equivalent to funding roughly 80 Cirata-scale floating solar plants\u2014projects capable of generating 112,000 jobs and powering four million households. The Cirata plant, built by China\u2019s PowerChina Huadong Engineering Corporation, is the world\u2019s largest floating solar facility. Tata Mustasya, executive director of Sustain and board chairman of Trend Asia, noted that indirect jobs from supply chains and local services were not included in the estimate. Despite growing investment, structural barriers remain: Indonesia lacks sufficient incentives, stable regulations, and green skills development, risking continued dependence on imported technology and foreign contractors. Without a strong local-content ecosystem\u2014including engineering, component manufacturing, and vocational training\u2014Indonesia may miss opportunities to build domestic industries. The electric vehicle (EV) sector presents major job creation potential: West Java is projected to attract IDR83.2 trillion (US$5.2 billion) in EV investments over the next decade, with EV plants potentially employing at least 72,000 workers\u2014about 4% of the province\u2019s open unemployment in 2024. Jobs at sites like the Karawang EV plant would pay IDR5,599,593 (US$334) monthly, more than double the average net salary of informal workers. China has shifted from financing coal projects to renewables, with 56% of its 2024 energy-sector financing in Indonesia going to renewables. Indonesia became the top recipient of Belt and Road Initiative investment in Southeast Asia in 2024. Mustasya emphasized the need to move beyond financing to knowledge exchange, including provincial partnerships between China and Indonesia, to improve grid planning, boost local manufacturing, and accelerate skills development. The study concludes that Indonesia\u2014rich in renewable resources, facing rising domestic energy demand, and benefiting from strong Chinese interest\u2014has a rare opportunity to fast-track its energy transition. However, success depends on stronger industrial policies, investment clarity, and long-term capacity-building partnerships. Mustasya stressed the need to align climate and economic planning: 'Our challenge now in Indonesia is how we can really connect Indonesia\u2019s climate agenda for decarbonisation and climate mitigation with our economic agenda to create employment and to push industrialisation.' The report follows a 2024 state visit by Prabowo to Beijing, where Indonesia and China signed agreements on clean energy, EVs, and industrial development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[Eco-Business](https://www.eco-business.com/news/indonesias-energy-transition-could-be-turbocharged-by-chinese-green-finance-study-finds/)\n\n**India mulls wider Swadeshi manufacturing policy to cut import dependence amid FY27 Budget preparations**\nThe Indian government is exploring a broader Swadeshi manufacturing policy to reduce reliance on foreign goods and strengthen domestic production amid preparations for the FY27 Budget, scheduled for presentation in February 2026. This follows the 2025-26 Budget announcement of the National Manufacturing Mission (NMM), which allocated Rs 100 crore to support small, medium, and medium industries under the Make in India initiative. The NMM currently focuses on five clusters\u2014engineering, electronics, consumer products, life sciences, and chemicals\u2014and supports sectors like clean-tech manufacturing, solar PV cells, EV batteries, electrolysers, wind turbines, high-voltage transmission equipment, grid-scale batteries, and labour-intensive industries such as footwear and leather. Inter-ministerial discussions, including with the finance ministry, are underway to expand the NMM\u2019s scope and potentially include new labour-intensive clusters. Despite existing initiatives like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme\u2014worth Rs 1.97 lakh crore over five years (2021-22 to 2025-26)\u2014results have been mixed: electronics manufacturing has flourished, while steel and textiles have underperformed due to low utilisation. The push for a wider policy is driven by rising global trade tensions, including 50% tariffs on Indian exports in the US, export curbs on rare-earth magnets by China, and retaliatory steel duties and import quotas from the EU. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal emphasized the need for India to become a self-reliant manufacturing hub, warning against overdependence on single suppliers or geographies, especially in critical sectors, and stressing that supply chain vulnerabilities must be assessed carefully. The goal remains to raise manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP from the current 16\u201317% to 25% by 2030.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 09:04 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-mulls-wider-swadeshi-manufacturing-policy-to-cut-import-dependence-amid-fy27-budget-preparations-13688047.html)\n\n**Electric Power Equipment and New Energy Industry Weekly Report: Yu Shu Technology Completes IPO Counseling, Tesla Expands Texas Factory for Optimus Robots**\nTesla plans to expand its Texas Gigafactory to include a dedicated production facility for the Optimus humanoid robot, with an annual capacity of 10 million units, expected to be operational by 2027, according to Teslarati on November 11, 2025. Yu Shu Technology has completed its IPO\u8f85\u5bfc (pre-IPO counseling) as reported by the China Securities Regulatory Commission's online platform on November 15, 2025, with the report issued by Zhejiang CBIRC, placing the company in the acceptance verification phase. The National Energy Administration issued guidance on November 12, 2025, promoting integrated development of new energy, aiming for new energy to become a key development model by 2030, with enhanced reliability and market competitiveness, supporting China\u2019s green transformation and modernization. The National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration jointly released a guidance on November 10, 2025, on new energy absorption and regulation, targeting a coordinated, multi-level system by 2030 to ensure smooth grid connection, diversified utilization, and efficient operation of new energy, with new electricity demand primarily met by new renewable generation. By 2030, the system\u2019s adaptability to new power systems will significantly improve, and cross-provincial and cross-regional renewable transactions will be smoother, supporting the annual absorption of over 200 GW of new renewable capacity to aid carbon peak goals. Price tracking shows that polysilicon prices remained stable at 52.0 yuan/kg for dense material and 50.0 yuan/kg for granular silicon, with weak market stability and low willingness to cut prices due to downstream pressure. Silicon wafer prices declined by 3.7% for 182-183.75mm N-type and 3.0% for 210mm N-type, driven by weak demand, compressing margins and leading to reduced production forecasts for November. Battery cell prices dropped 1.6% for 182-183.75mm N-type and remained flat for 210mm N-type, with reduced procurement and a shift toward larger formats increasing pricing pressure. Module prices held steady across all types\u2014TOPCon, HJT, and BC\u2014despite cost reductions, with no price cuts due to weak domestic demand and strong overseas demand; November module production is expected to decline by about 3%. Glass prices remained flat at 20 yuan/\u33a1 for 3.2mm coated glass and decreased 1.6% to 12.3 yuan/\u33a1 for 2.0mm coated glass. Investment recommendations highlight BC technology (Aiko, Longi), supply-side (Daquan Energy, Foltex), solar-storage (Sunway, Deyue), power marketization (Langxin), domestic substitution (Shiquan), overseas expansion (Hengdian East Magnetic, Bowei Alloy), and suggest monitoring companies like GCL, Tongwei, Xinyi, TCL Chonghuan, Xin Te, Dier Laser, Fosun, Jinko, Trina, Maiwei, Jingsheng, Hongyuan.

This growth is driven by rising global demand for clean energy, supported by environmental urgency, climate commitments such as the Paris Agreement, and national net-zero targets. Government policies, including feed-in tariffs, tax credits (e.g., the U.S. Investment Tax Credit), renewable energy certificates, and net metering, are key enablers. Technological advancements have reduced costs per watt and increased efficiency, with mono-SI (monocrystalline silicon) modules leading in adoption. Post-COVID, demand for energy resilience and backup power has accelerated investment in off-grid and hybrid solar systems. Despite strong growth, challenges include supply chain bottlenecks due to dependency on critical materials like polysilicon and silver\u2014mostly sourced from China\u2014and regulatory inconsistencies in developing regions. End-of-life management and recycling of solar modules also pose environmental concerns. Regionally, North America leads in 2023, driven by U.S. incentives and strong residential and utility-scale adoption; Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing, led by China\u2019s dominance in production and installation under its 14th Five-Year Plan, with India, Japan, and Australia expanding rooftop programs. Europe is advancing through the EU Green Deal and REPowerEU, aiming to reduce reliance on Russian gas. Latin America and MEA (Middle East and Africa) are growing via solar farms in Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa, supported by public-private partnerships and declining costs. Market segments include Mono-SI, Multi-SI, CDTE, CIGS, A-Si, and emerging technologies like perovskite. Applications span utility-scale PV power stations, commercial buildings, residential rooftops, and off-grid uses. Key players include JinkoSolar, LONGi, JA Solar, First Solar, Canadian Solar, Trina Solar, Hanwha Solutions, Risen Energy, Seraphim, Shunfeng, GCL-Poly, LG Electronics, and Panasonic. Strategic opportunities include bifacial and transparent modules, IoT/AI-integrated smart solar systems, battery storage hybrids, solar-powered green hydrogen, and solar-integrated building materials. The market is expected to be a cornerstone of global energy infrastructure in the climate action decade.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2025 04:55 AM\nSource:[Taiwan News](https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6247635)\n\n**The One Big Beautiful Bill: Turning Point for UK and EU Energy Players Operating in the United States**\nOn 4 July 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which significantly reshapes U.S. energy policy by phasing out tax credits for wind and solar projects under the Internal Revenue Code and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Projects must begin construction before 5 July 2026 or be placed in service by 31 December 2027 to qualify for Production Tax Credits (Section 45Y) or Investment Tax Credits (Section 48E). The U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Notice 2025-42 clarified that physical work of a significant nature\u2014such as off-site manufacturing or ordering site-specific equipment\u2014must be performed to demonstrate commencement of construction, with a continuous construction requirement to avoid credit ineligibility. The OBBB extends tax incentives for geothermal, nuclear, hydrogen, and energy storage projects, with credits available for projects beginning construction before 2033 (geothermal/nuclear) or 2027 (hydrogen), and energy storage retaining Investment Tax Credits on a phased withdrawal schedule. However, all clean energy projects must comply with strict Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules: by 2030, at least 75% of material costs in energy storage projects must not originate from designated foreign entities (China, Iran, North Korea, Russia), increasing pressure on supply chains. BloombergNEF estimates a 7% reduction in energy storage additions due to these constraints. The OBBB strongly benefits fossil fuels by mandating 30 new oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf over 15 years\u2014up from just three under the IRA\u2014restoring pre-IRA royalty rates, reinstating full deductions for intangible drilling costs, and delaying the methane emissions fee until 2035. As a result, U.S. investment in wind and solar dropped 36% in 2025 compared to the second half of 2024, while EU investment rose 63%. Major UK and EU energy firms including RWE, TotalEnergies, and Shell have halted or scaled back U.S. wind projects, with Shell reportedly preparing to bid for new oil leases under the new annual schedule. The policy shift signals a major pivot in capital allocation toward upstream and midstream fossil fuel opportunities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 07:35 AM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-turning-8938902/)\n\n**The AI revolution has a power problem - kuwaitTimes**\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged on a podcast with OpenAI's Sam Altman that the primary challenge in the AI revolution is not a shortage of computing power, but rather the availability of sufficient electrical power and the speed of infrastructure deployment near energy sources. Tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Meta are investing approximately $400 billion in 2025 and even more in 2026 to build the data center infrastructure needed for AI, accelerating in-house chip production to compete with Nvidia. However, constructing data centers takes an average of two years in the U.S., while new high-voltage power lines require five to ten years to become operational. Virginia\u2019s Dominion Energy now has a data center order book of 47 gigawatts\u2014equivalent to 47 nuclear reactors\u2014up from 40 gigawatts a year prior. Data centers could consume 7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, according to studies. Some experts, like Jonathan Koomey from UC Berkeley, caution that projections may be inflated due to incentives from utilities and tech firms to promote growth; many proposed data centers may never be built. If growth materializes, a 45-gigawatt power shortfall could emerge by 2028\u2014equivalent to the consumption of 33 million U.S. households. In response, several U.S. utilities have delayed retiring coal plants, and natural gas\u2014currently powering 40% of global data centers\u2014has gained renewed favor due to its fast deployment. Georgia\u2019s utilities have requested approval to install 10 gigawatts of gas-powered generators, and companies like xAI and others are purchasing used turbines, including from aircraft, to accelerate deployment. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated in October that the greatest threat is not climate change, but losing the AI arms race due to insufficient power. Tech companies are downplaying past climate commitments: Google removed its 2030 net-zero pledge from its website in June. Instead, they are promoting long-term solutions: Amazon supports Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), Google plans to restart a reactor in Iowa by 2029, and the Trump administration announced an $80 billion plan to build ten conventional nuclear reactors by 2030. Additionally, hyperscalers are investing in solar and battery storage\u2014Texas plans to add 100 gigawatts by 2030. Google and Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink are also exploring placing AI chips in orbit, powered by solar energy, with Google planning tests in 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 07:40 PM\nSource:[kuwaittimes.com](https://kuwaittimes.com/article/35535/technology/the-ai-revolution-has-a-power-problem/)\n\n**Clean Energy Tax Changes Cut Timelines, Add Red Tape**\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) introduces significant changes to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), reshaping clean energy project development and investment planning. Key changes include a hard deadline for Section 45Y (clean energy production credit) and Section 48E (clean energy investment credit) eligibility: projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027. This compressed timeline threatens projects in early planning stages, as their financial models\u2014based on longer IRA timelines\u2014may no longer be viable. Projects already in service under the original IRA rules remain safe. A second major change involves Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules: projects beginning construction after December 31, 2024, that receive material assistance from prohibited entities (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) in sourcing components, financing, or IP are disqualified from credits. Uncertainty remains until Treasury issues guidance on cost thresholds. Tax equity investors will likely focus only on projects meeting the July 4, 2026, deadline, forcing developers to secure earlier, more expensive financing or shift to direct equity or state-level incentives. Merchant wind and solar projects may be paused or abandoned due to loss of long-term credit certainty, while utility-backed projects may continue with tighter margins. Battery storage projects are less affected by timing but face FEOC supply chain risks; standalone or co-located storage projects beginning construction by December 31, 2033, remain eligible for Section 48E credits. Nuclear energy is strengthened: it retains full access to Section 45Y and 48E credits through 2033 and gains a new 10% bonus credit for advanced nuclear facilities based on local employment. Additionally, nuclear projects can now use master limited partnerships (MLPs) for tax-advantaged public capital access. However, nuclear projects face new FEOC risks: existing plants may lose eligibility if owned by 'specified foreign entities' (effective immediately) or 'foreign-influenced entities' (effective July 4, 2027). Developers must audit ownership, debt, and governance structures. The OBBBA also introduces new incentives for fossil fuels: 100% bonus depreciation for qualified production property placed in service by December 31, 2030, if construction began before January 1, 2029; a 2.5% production cost incentive for metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030; and new onshore/offshore oil and gas lease sales with reduced royalties. Section 45Q carbon capture credits are enhanced. These changes signal a shift from broad, long-term renewable support to a targeted, restrictive framework. Wind and solar developers face urgent timelines, battery and nuclear developers face supply chain compliance challenges, and fossil fuels gain new financial advantages. The long-term result is a restructured energy investment landscape with new risks and opportunities across sectors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 01:53 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/clean-energy-tax-changes-cut-timelines-2514478/)\n\n**Americans, act fast: Big home energy tax credits set to expire in 2026  --  here's how to claim up to $5,000 before time runs out**\nHomeowners across the United States have until December 31, 2025, to claim federal energy tax credits under the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) and the Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC). The EEHIC offers a 30% tax credit for qualifying home improvements, with annual limits of up to $1,200 for general upgrades and $2,000 for specific high-efficiency systems like heat pumps and water heaters. The RCEC provides a 30% credit with no annual or lifetime cap for renewable energy installations such as solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage. Both programs were established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), though the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBBA) shortened their expiration from 2032 to 2025. Credits are nonrefundable and only apply to primary residences. Homeowners must file IRS Form 5695 with their tax return and retain receipts, certifications, and Qualified Manufacturer Identification Numbers (QMIDs) for qualifying items.

OBBBA introduces full expensing, allowing manufacturers to deduct the entire cost of plant, equipment, and research investments in the year they are made, which could lower capital costs and encourage new plants. The act preserves the 45X advanced\u2011manufacturing production credit and boosts the 48D credit for semiconductors and solar wafers. However, the article notes new supply\u2011chain restrictions, cuts to financing programs, and early termination of some clean\u2011energy tax credits that pose headwinds. It highlights that post\u2011OBBBA demand for grid equipment, geothermal, nuclear, and upstream battery and solar components remains strong, while wind, EV assembly, and downstream battery/solar manufacturing face challenges. The article cites a 30\u202f% supply deficit for U.S. power transformers and that imports account for about 80\u202f% of current supply, suggesting domestic investment should focus on high\u2011risk components and next\u2011generation technologies.

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, gave developers a 30\u202f% tax credit for new clean\u2011energy investments and a production credit for electricity generated. President Donald Trump\u2019s July\u202f4,\u202f2024 executive order ended those credits, requiring projects to start construction by July\u202f4,\u202f2026 or be operational by the end of 2027 to qualify. The article reports that states are accelerating permitting and procurement to meet the deadline. Colorado Governor Jared Polis has ordered state agencies to prioritize permits for credit\u2011eligible projects, and Will Toor, Colorado Energy Office executive director, says the state aims to advance \u201cmultiple gigawatts\u201d of projects before the credits expire. Maine\u2019s Public Utilities Commission has launched an accelerated procurement process for roughly 1,600\u202fgigawatt\u2011hours of renewable energy, about 13\u202f% of the state\u2019s usage. The article cites Patty O\u2019Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, who says \u2018Every month counts\u2019 and that the tax credits are the financial backbone of nearly every project in the pipeline. Will Toor notes that \u2018If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.\u2019 Mike O\u2019Boyle of Energy Innovation estimates that the credits have reduced project costs by 30\u201150\u202f%. The article also mentions that federal data show states plan to add nearly 200\u202fgigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028, enough to power roughly 145\u202fmillion homes. States such as California, Michigan and Pennsylvania are pursuing streamlined permitting and interconnection processes to speed deployment.

The \u2018Korean IRA\u2019 Is a Joke**\nSouth Korea\u2019s proposed \u2018Korean IRA\u2019\u2014a tax\u2011credit scheme modeled on the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act\u2014would allow companies to deduct 15\u202f% of production costs for advanced\u2011technology products that are made and used domestically. According to the article, the current draft would give the three largest battery makers (LG\u202fEnergy\u202fSolution, SK\u202fOn, and Samsung\u202fSDI) a total refund of roughly 300\u202fbillion\u202fKRW (\u2248\u202f$200\u202fmillion) per year, based on 2024 production estimates. That amount represents only 0.06\u202f% of the battery sector\u2019s 48.4784\u202ftrillion\u202fKRW in sales, and most of the batteries produced by LG\u202fEnergy\u202fSolution and Samsung\u202fSDI are exported, leaving them with almost no eligible refund. SK\u202fOn, which supplies Hyundai and Kia batteries, is estimated to receive about 300\u202fbillion\u202fKRW, but the company has never paid corporate tax, so the credit would effectively be a zero\u2011sized benefit.

The prohibited foreign entity rules prevent certain entities owned or controlled by foreign governments or companies from claiming renewable energy credits. The material assistance rules prevent eligibility for certain credits where a prohibited foreign entity has materially assisted with manufacturing or construction. The Legislation also terminates the clean electricity production credit and investment tax credit for wind and solar energy property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, but with a one-year delay for projects that begin construction within the next year. The Legislation contains revisions to Section 45X, including amendments to the definition of 'battery module' and the addition of phaseouts to Section 45X tax credits for the production of critical minerals starting in 2031. The prohibited foreign entity rules also prohibit any manufacturer that meets the definition of 'prohibited foreign entity' from claiming a Section 45X credit. The material assistance rules also apply to prohibit any property manufactured with the material assistance of a prohibited foreign entity from qualifying as an eligible component for purposes of Section 45X. The Legislation repeals several other IRA credits, including the Section 25E credits for previously owned clean vehicles and the Section 30D clean vehicle credit. The Legislation also increases the advanced manufacturing tax credit, including for semiconductor manufacturers, from 25 percent to 35 percent for certain new facilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 06, 2025 07:18 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/analysis-of-renewable-energy-credit-3295399/)\n\n**From IRA to OBBBA: A New Era for Clean Energy Tax Credits | Advisories | Arnold & Porter**\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has significantly changed the clean energy tax credit landscape established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The OBBBA introduces accelerated repeal schedules for most renewable energy tax credits, compresses deadlines for certain projects, enhances domestic content requirements, eliminates several electric vehicle and residential energy incentives, and implements new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions. These changes reflect a fundamental shift in federal clean energy policy, affecting investors, developers, manufacturers, and other actors in the renewables sector. The FEOC restrictions prevent entities tied to adversarial nations, particularly China, from accessing U.S. clean energy tax incentives. The rules are definitional in nature and are broadly drafted to encompass all types of entities with varying levels of foreign involvement. Taxpayers may exclude certain binding written contracts entered into prior to June 16, 2025 if construction of such facilities begins before August 1, 2025. Failure to comply with the FEOC restrictions will subject a taxpayer to penalties for non-compliance. Several clean vehicle and residential energy credits will terminate completely over the next year, including the Clean Vehicle Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit. Pre-IRA tax credits under Section 48 and Section 45 remain eligible for energy projects that began construction before January 1, 2025. The OBBBA introduces a fundamental realignment of federal clean energy policy, with immediate and long-term consequences for tax credit eligibility, project financing, and supply chain strategy. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, proactive planning and early compliance efforts will be critical to preserving value and mitigating risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[arnoldporter.com](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2025/07/from-ira-to-obbba-a-new-era-for-clean-energy-tax-credits)\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act: Initial Takeaways for Green Technology, Taxes, and Healthcare**\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed by President Biden on August 16, 2022, allocates more than $400\u202fbillion in spending and is projected to generate over $700\u202fbillion in revenue.  Key provisions include a $369\u202fbillion climate\u2011action package that expands clean\u2011energy tax credits, a new 15\u202f% corporate minimum tax for firms with more than $1\u202fbillion in adjusted financial\u2011statement income, and a 1\u202f% excise tax on stock buybacks.  The Act also extends Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years, empowers the federal government to negotiate prescription\u2011drug prices, and provides nearly $80\u202fbillion in new funding for the IRS, of which $46.6\u202fbillion is earmarked for enforcement.  For green technology, the Act introduces a new annual production tax credit for qualified clean hydrogen, expands the Section\u202f45Q carbon\u2011capture credit, removes sunset provisions for solar and wind ITC/ PTC, and adds a new Section\u202f45X advanced\u2011manufacturing PTC.  Electric\u2011vehicle incentives are expanded to include a $7,500 federal credit for new vehicles and a $4,000 credit for used vehicles, with eligibility tied to MSRP and income thresholds.  The Act also establishes a Drug Price Negotiation Program that will set maximum fair prices for Medicare Part\u202fD drugs, caps out\u2011of\u2011pocket Part\u202fD costs at $2,000 per beneficiary per year, and requires coverage of certain adult vaccinations under Medicaid.  \"The legislation marks one of the largest investments for climate change in U.S. history,\" the article notes.  \"The new corporate AMT will be a prepayment of regular tax liability,\" the IRS commissioner said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 09, 2022 12:00 AM\nSource:[morganlewis.com](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/08/inflation-reduction-act-initial-takeaways-for-green-technology-taxes-and-healthcare)\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act Would Significantly Expand Federal Income Tax Benefits for Green Technology Industry**\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expands federal income\u2011tax benefits for green\u2011technology projects.  It extends the existing Section\u202f45 PTC and Section\u202f48 ITC for wind and solar facilities, adds the PTC to new solar projects, and removes sunset provisions for facilities placed in service after\u202f2021.  The Act introduces a new Section\u202f45Y clean\u2011electricity production credit (CEPTC) and a Section\u202f48D clean\u2011electricity investment credit (CEITC) that apply to any renewable or energy\u2011storage facility that begins construction after\u202f2025, with rates tied to a 0\u202f% greenhouse\u2011gas\u2011emissions standard.  Energy\u2011storage facilities gain an election out of the public\u2011utility property limitation and are treated as five\u2011year property under MACRS.  The Act also expands the ITC/PTC to energy\u2011storage, biogas, microgrid controller equipment, and provides a separate PTC for electricity used to produce clean hydrogen under Section\u202f45V.  Wage\u2011and\u2011apprenticeship standards can trigger an 80\u202f% credit haircut, while meeting domestic\u2011content or energy\u2011community standards can add a 10\u202f% (or 20\u202f% for low\u2011income communities) credit enhancement.  The Section\u202f45Q carbon\u2011capture credit is extended to facilities beginning construction before\u202f2033, with a higher rate for direct\u2011air\u2011capture.  Fuel\u2011production credits are extended through\u202f2024 and a new Section\u202f45Z clean\u2011fuel credit is introduced for 2025\u20112027.  The dormant Section\u202f48C investment credit is revived for advanced\u2011energy production and manufacturing, with a $10\u202fbillion ceiling.  The Act creates refundable credits for tax\u2011exempt entities, allows sale of refundable credits, and changes carry\u2011over rules to a 3\u2011year carryback and 22\u2011year carryforward.  These provisions aim to streamline compliance, incentivize domestic content, and broaden financing options for green projects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 04, 2022 12:00 AM\nSource:[morganlewis.com](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/08/inflation-reduction-act-would-significantly-expand-federal-income-tax-benefits-for-green-technology-industry)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters were asked to estimate the likelihood that, before January 1, 2026, legislation will cap the amount of 45X clean energy manufacturing tax credits any taxpayer or affiliated group can receive. The forecasts reflect a range of probabilistic estimates and analytical perspectives, influenced by political context, legislative precedent, industry interests, and current legislative activity. Most experts agree that the Republican Party's control of the executive and legislative branches\u2014and their public criticism of uncapped IRA credits\u2014substantially raises the possibility of statutory caps compared to previous periods. Several experts (notably from public choice economics and legislative affairs backgrounds) assign a high probability (63%-75%), citing incentives for fiscal retrenchment, the ease of using budget reconciliation, and widespread fiscal concern over 'runaway' credits. They point to historical patterns where Congress has capped or sunset credits when cost projections soared. Conversely, other experts\u2014particularly those grounded in tax policy, regulatory economics, law, and legislative politics\u2014highlight substantial countervailing factors: powerful industry lobbying from domestic manufacturers, recent reforms (such as FEOC exclusions and phaseouts) that have thus far stopped short of imposing caps, and a lack of legislative text or reporting explicitly signaling an imminent cap. These experts assign moderate-to-low probabilities (10%-38%), reasoning that Congress more frequently prefers tightening eligibility, accelerating phaseouts, or targeting foreign entities, rather than introducing hard per-taxpayer caps, especially given administrative complexity and political risks of angering manufacturers in red and swing states. Across all perspectives, the consensus is that while a cap is plausible and more likely under unified GOP government than not, there is currently no direct evidence of a cap's enactment or imminent legislative consensus as of November 2025. Probabilities are heterogeneous, with a rough split: some view caps as clearly probable (60-75%); others, less so (10-38%), citing base rates and enacted legislative details to date. The median and modal probabilities hover just below 50%, reflecting divided expert opinion and uncertainty about late-cycle legislative maneuvering.",
