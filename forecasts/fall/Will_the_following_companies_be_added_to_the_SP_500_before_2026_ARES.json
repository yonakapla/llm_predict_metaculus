However, discretionary moves by the committee (including headline 'snubs' like MSTR, which met all criteria but was bypassed due to its business model and risk profile) mean inclusion is not guaranteed, particularly if the committee selects from other large eligible techs or search for greater sectoral diversity. The pipeline for S&P 500 additions is crowded, but ARES stands out as a strong, conventional, and liquid candidate fitting ongoing index needs. Given the frequency of index changes, the high likelihood of at least one open slot through year-end, and committee interest in balancing financial underrepresentation, I assign the probability as moderately high, but not extreme: much higher than chance, though below lock-level certainty.

However, the major annual rebalance has just passed with ARES notably *not* selected, and there is heightened competition from tech/fintech, indicated by the recent prioritization of those companies. The S&P 500 committee has demonstrated in 2025 an increased willingness to use discretion\u2014skipping otherwise eligible high-profile names (notably MSTR)\u2014and the vast majority of index inclusions (historically around 80+%) occur during the scheduled rebalances, not off-cycle (only a handful per year, usually triggered by specific constituent events). The probability of off-cycle inclusion before year-end is meaningfully less than at the start of Q3. Base rate analysis suggests post-rebalance additions are rare and most likely only if a major index constituent is acquired, delisted, or becomes ineligible. Thus, while ARES is structurally positioned as 'next up' among financials, lacking a catalyst and being bypassed in the September rebalance significantly mutes the probability. In summary, ARES inclusion before 2026 is possible but not probable in light of the window just missed, the committee's selective approach, and no current signs of an imminent opening.",

The primary uncertainty is the committee\u2019s exercise of discretion\u2014whether they prioritize tech/fintech over financials in the next round, especially due to market cap, liquidity, industry headlines, or inertia (as seen in the recent MicroStrategy exclusion for sector/asset-composition reasons). However, nothing in recent news or historical precedent specifically disadvantages ARES: its sector (alternatives/asset management) is increasingly mainstream, and index methodology does not restrict such firms. The base rate for similar companies (large, well-established financials closed out due to sector limits) is low; most such candidates are added within 1-3 rebalance windows. Thus, I believe the probability is well above even odds, yet not extreme, as multiple strong candidates will compete for a limited number of 2025 slots and there remains nonzero risk from idiosyncratic committee decisions.

However, the S&P 500 committee's recent discretionary choices\u2014most notably passing over high-profile, technically eligible companies like MSTR and Robinhood in favor of others\u2014introduce meaningful uncertainty, especially when slots are competitive. Still, ARES is fundamentally less controversial than crypto-reliant firms and benefits from recent increases in financial sector appetite. With up to one quarter remaining for a 2025 inclusion (December), and sector-rotation dynamics potentially favoring financials, I assess the probability as distinctly above 50% though not overwhelmingly high, reflecting both strong accounting-based eligibility and nontrivial committee unpredictability.",

Numerous analyst and news reports (e.g. KBW, Economic Times, elEconomista) list ARES among the top candidates, with some suggesting it's overdue for inclusion. While there is always residual uncertainty due to committee discretion (e.g., may prioritize a tech company like AppLovin or energy firm such as Cheniere to balance sector weightings), the strong and sustained business model, accounting transparency, and sector fit for ARES make the probability of inclusion high if at least one more S&P 500 rebalance occurs before 2026.

Right now, the candidate queue includes not just ARES but multiple top-decile tech/fintech names, and the committee has a recent history of unpredictably skipping obvious sector rebalances.

Recent committee behavior, particularly in late-cycle annual windows, shows a marked tendency toward balancing public sentiment and signaling stability rather than strictly rewarding the 'next obvious candidate.' While ARES is arguably the top financial contender, there is no strong public commitment for December\u2019s window, and the risk that a non-financial (or much larger unexpected eligible) is added instead remains significant. Thus, your qualitative valuation is sound, but the extremity of your forecast overstates the comfort we should have in the committee\u2019s predictability this close to year-end.

ARES, as a financial with clean and recurring fee revenues, offers not just strong fundamentals but the kind of earnings transparency and accounting conventionality the S&P 500 committee tends to prize most post-MSTR-style headline snubs. Recent skepticism of less-traditional business models (e.g., crypto-exposed or highly volatile earnings) increases ARES's attractiveness as a risk-mitigating, sector-balance reaffirming inclusion, especially in a macro context where stability and predictability are at a premium. From an earnings quality angle, these qualitative factors, not always visible in raw fundamentals, incrementally increase the implied odds above what might result from strictly quantitative screening. So while a 68% estimate is prudent, a slightly higher mark (in the low-to-mid 70s) might more accurately capture how earnings quality acts as a positive differentiator when the committee\u2019s choices are discretionary but reputationally risk-averse."

No credible evidence was presented of disqualifying risks to ARES\u2019s candidacy, while its sector fit and analyst support remain strong. However, the robust debate highlighted the importance of not overweighting near-certainty: the window for inclusion, while real, is limited and there is always risk of committee discretion, a tech allocation, or lack of an open slot. This argues for maintaining a probability close to my initial forecast, but with a slight upward revision to reflect the very strong consensus cluster (most forecasts 65\u201380%) and the additional validation that sector rotation and structural need for financials would play in ARES's favor if any sudden slot opens.",

Multiple independent sector and fund analysts consistently identify ARES as 'next up' for financials, given sector underweight, and a review of historical base rates suggests that pace of post-rebalance additions in similar windows is non-negligible for large, in-queue financials. Furthermore, my peers argue persuasively that committee discretion, while a wildcard, is less likely to be negative for an orthodox, well-regarded asset manager like ARES than for tech-adjacent or crypto-centric outliers. As such, while the risk remains that ARES could be passed over again (if a slot opens and a tech/fintech candidate is prioritized), the probability is considerably higher than my original 22%.

A majority of well-reasoned forecasts clustered in the mid-to-high 60s to low 70s, with only one notably bearish outlier (22%) that was broadly critiqued for underweighting the ongoing potential for off-cycle, M&A-driven index additions and for misreading the committee\u2019s willingness to rebalance sectors late in the year. Some solid perspectives noted that, while ARES is clearly near the front of the queue, index committee discretion, competition from tech/fintech, and rebalancing unpredictability justify caution against extreme certainty. The highest probability forecast (80%) was critiqued as too high given the possibility that December might bring another surprise. I find the 68\u201374% band is the consensus sweet spot among forecasts that best integrate both historical precedent and the current index pipeline. No new news or arguments undermined my initial call from the lens of firm growth and sector rotation theory. Thus, I will make a very slight upward revision to 71%, more squarely in line with the modal group judgment and to acknowledge the persistent analyst consensus momentum toward financials in late 2025.",

Multiple participants stressed that while ARES is superbly positioned based on fundamentals, accounting clarity, and sector underrepresentation, the September rebalance window's passing without ARES being chosen is a meaningful signal that the S&P 500 committee may be more tightly prioritizing tech/fintech in the current market narrative. Additionally, as several forecasters argued, most new inclusions tend to cluster in scheduled rebalance windows rather than ad hoc ones, and post-rebalance inclusions are now comparatively rare without a clear slot, acquisition, or delisting. This, combined with the fact that sector fill needs are real but not the committee's sole consideration (with discretionary 'snubs' recently applied to even eligible, sector-balanced candidates), means there is more structural uncertainty than initially weighed. While the overall probability remains materially above 50%\u2014ARES is still likely the leading financial candidate\u2014the risk that no slot becomes available or tech/energy is prioritized in December is non-negligible. As a result, I am modestly lowering the probability to 65%, putting it at the high end of the moderate range, still higher than many but short of high confidence.",

Most peer probabilities cluster in the mid-60s-to-low-70s, all reasoning from strong sectoral need, clear technical eligibility, and persistent analyst attention. The key points giving more comfort in a modest upward revision are: (1) repeated identification of ARES as 'next up' for a financial slot, (2) multiple expert corrections reminding that index additions can occur off-cycle if a vacancy arises, and (3) agreement that the committee's unpredictability does impose real limits, but the historical base rate for a candidate of this profile is higher than I initially weighted. My main concern\u2014committee discretion\u2014persists, but is somewhat outweighed by the clear structural drivers and the frequency with which large, boring financials eventually make it. Several group critiques argued that a probability in the lower 60s somewhat underweights the scenario base rate for candidates like ARES, particularly as we approach year-end and with sector rebalancing pressure. Therefore, I am raising my probability, but remain below the more aggressive mid-to-high 70s/80s forecasts due to ongoing uncertainty as seen with recent snubs (e.g., MSTR, Robinhood).",

Multiple forecasters provided persuasive arguments regarding the risks posed by committee discretion, the possibility of continued preference for tech/fintech, and the sharply diminished odds post-major annual rebalance absent a clear near-term index vacancy. While ARES's accounting quality and sector fit are exceptional, several credible peers (including IndexProcess, Fundamental, MarketMicrostructure, and SignalingTheory experts) highlighted that the mere existence of one or two high-quality windows before year-end, combined with a crowded queue and lingering randomness, makes a forecast above ~75% difficult to sustain. Strong base rates for eligible financials remain, but I recognize I underweighted the possibility of sudden new, highly compelling candidates or a fintech/tech 'run' to year-end. My adjustment reflects this committee unpredictability and the practical likelihood that at most 1-2 additional slots will open before 2026.",

All three hit intraday record highs, with the S&P 500 and DJIA closing at fresh all-time highs, while the Nasdaq-100 declined below Thursday\u2019s peak. The rally was driven by strong investor enthusiasm for AI-related stocks, fueled by OpenAI\u2019s $500 billion valuation\u2014making it the most valuable startup in history\u2014and new AI partnerships. However, the Nasdaq-100 was pressured by declines in key tech names: Palantir (PLTR) dropped 7.5% after a Reuters report revealed internal U.S. Army concerns over security flaws in its battlefield communications platform, though Palantir refuted the claims, stating the issues were resolved. Meta (META) fell due to product demo failures and safety concerns, Netflix (NFLX) declined amid a consumer boycott, and Applied Materials (AMAT) dropped after revising its revenue outlook, projecting a $110 million hit in Q4 and $600 million in fiscal 2026 due to export restrictions. Despite these setbacks, Nvidia (NVDA) became the first U.S. public company to reach a $4.5 trillion market cap, with Cantor Fitzgerald projecting it could exceed $10 trillion as AI infrastructure spending accelerates. Meanwhile, the U.S. government shutdown\u2014now in its third day\u2014delayed the September nonfarm payrolls release, but markets remained unfazed. Private data sources like ADP reported a loss of 32,000 private-sector jobs in September, and the ISM Services index fell to 50, indicating stagnation. These reports reinforced expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, with futures markets signaling near-certainty for a cut in October and an 80% chance in December. BlackRock\u2019s Global Infrastructure Partners is in advanced talks to acquire Aligned Data Centers in a potential $40 billion deal. Google announced a $4 billion investment in a new AI and cloud data center in Arkansas, powered by solar and battery projects with Entergy Arkansas. Vertiv Holdings (VRT) surged on strong AI-driven demand for data center infrastructure, supported by partnerships like Hitachi and OpenAI. IBM continued its rally on quantum computing advancements, including deployments with HSBC and Vanguard, and launched new AI models and infrastructure partnerships. Tesla (TSLA) reported record Q3 deliveries, but the stock fell due to concerns over temporary demand spikes from pre-expiration tax credit buying and ongoing challenges in Europe and EV competition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 02:16 PM\nSource:[Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-week-that-was-the-week-ahead-macro-markets-october-5-2025-1035256698)\n\n**111 Capital Makes New Investment in Strategy Inc $MSTR**\n111 Capital made a new investment in Strategy Inc.

Despite the ongoing sixth day of the U.S. government shutdown, which delayed key economic data like nonfarm payrolls, alternative indicators such as the ADP payroll report reinforced the market's belief in a 25-basis-point rate cut at the next FOMC meeting, with the market pricing in an 87% chance of two such cuts by year-end. The S&P 500 reached a record high of 6750, currently trading at 6734, with the RSI in overbought territory, suggesting possible consolidation; immediate support is at 6700 and 6600, while a drop below 6150 would invalidate the longer-term uptrend. Key catalysts include AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) surging over 30% on a deal with OpenAI, potentially worth tens of billions in revenue, and Critical Metal Corp jumping 75% premarket on reports of a potential Trump administration equity stake in a Greenland rare earth project. Crypto stocks rose as Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $125,000, lifting Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Riot Platforms. The USD is strengthening, supported by a falling yen, while EUR/USD declines following French Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu\u2019s resignation after 27 days, deepening France\u2019s political instability.

All three hit intraday record highs, with the S&P 500 and DJIA closing at fresh all-time highs, while the Nasdaq-100 declined below Thursday\u2019s peak. The rally was driven by strong investor enthusiasm for AI-related stocks, fueled by OpenAI\u2019s $500 billion valuation\u2014making it the most valuable startup in history\u2014and new AI partnerships. However, the Nasdaq-100 was pressured by declines in key tech names: Palantir (PLTR) dropped 7.5% after a Reuters report revealed internal U.S. Army concerns over security flaws in its battlefield communications platform, though Palantir refuted the claims, stating the issues were resolved. Meta (META) fell due to product demo failures and safety concerns, Netflix (NFLX) declined amid a consumer boycott, and Applied Materials (AMAT) dropped after revising its revenue outlook, projecting a $110 million hit in Q4 and $600 million in fiscal 2026 due to export restrictions. Despite these setbacks, Nvidia (NVDA) became the first U.S. public company to reach a $4.5 trillion market cap, with Cantor Fitzgerald projecting it could exceed $10 trillion as AI infrastructure spending accelerates. Meanwhile, the U.S. government shutdown\u2014now in its third day\u2014delayed the September nonfarm payrolls release, but markets remained unfazed. Private data sources like ADP reported a loss of 32,000 private-sector jobs in September, and the ISM Services index fell to 50, indicating stagnation. These reports reinforced expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, with futures markets signaling near-certainty for a cut in October and an 80% chance in December. BlackRock\u2019s Global Infrastructure Partners is in advanced talks to acquire Aligned Data Centers in a potential $40 billion deal. Google announced a $4 billion investment in a new AI and cloud data center in Arkansas, powered by solar and battery projects with Entergy Arkansas. Vertiv Holdings (VRT) surged on strong AI-driven demand for data center infrastructure, supported by partnerships like Hitachi and OpenAI. IBM continued its rally on quantum computing advancements, including deployments with HSBC and Vanguard, and launched new AI models and infrastructure partnerships. Tesla (TSLA) reported record Q3 deliveries, but the stock fell due to concerns over temporary demand spikes from pre-expiration tax credit buying and ongoing challenges in Europe and EV competition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 02:16 PM\nSource:[Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-week-that-was-the-week-ahead-macro-markets-october-5-2025-1035256698)\n\n**111 Capital Makes New Investment in Strategy Inc $MSTR**\n111 Capital made a new investment in Strategy Inc.

The company meets the size and other key criteria for inclusion, yet its market capitalization is largely derived from bitcoin holdings rather than its underlying information\u2011technology business. The strategists claim the exclusion could limit the influx of crypto assets into investor portfolios and may prompt other index providers to reconsider including similar corporate crypto treasuries. They also note that the Nasdaq has begun requiring shareholder approval for companies that use crypto assets to fund new share issuances. The article suggests that investors and index providers might shift their focus toward crypto firms with real operating businesses, such as exchanges or miners, rather than corporate treasuries. 'This is signaling that the committee, which can apply discretion in its index inclusion decisions, is concerned about including in the S&P 500 index companies such as MicroStrategy that are effectively bitcoin funds,' the strategists said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 10:14 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The additions will take effect on September 22, 2025. Seyffart also noted that MicroStrategy (MSTR) was not included in this round of additions, a decision attributed to the discretion of the S&P 500 committee. Balchunas explained, 'Why wasn\u2019t $MSTR allowed into the S&P 500 Index despite meeting all the criteria? Because the Committee said no.'

The most recent quarter saw no updates, prompting speculation that the next reshuffle\u2014typically the largest because it incorporates annual float\u2011factor adjustments\u2014might bring new members.  Melissa Roberts, a managing director at Stephens, noted that the \"third\u2011quarter reshuffle is typically the largest rebalance because it includes annual constituent float\u2011factor changes,\" and that \"S&P Dow Jones Indices historically took advantage of the liquidity opportunity to make more discretionary changes than in other quarters.\"  To qualify for inclusion, a U.S.\u2011domiciled company must have a market capitalization of at least $22.7\u202fbillion, a float market capitalization of at least $10.25\u202fbillion, and demonstrate financial viability by being profitable on a GAAP basis in the most recent quarter and over the past four quarters.  Current candidates include AppLovin Corp. (APP), Reddit Inc. (RDDT), Pinterest Inc. (PINS), Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), Sofi Technologies Inc. (SOFI) and Carvana Co. (CVNA).  AppLovin, with a $164\u202fbillion market cap, is the largest eligible firm, while Strategy Inc. (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, has newly cleared the financial\u2011viability hurdle.  Other newly eligible names are Astera Labs Inc. (ALAB) and Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG), the latter having risen 42\u202f% in the last month.  Although Robinhood was expected to join, it was not selected in the last rebalance and remains the third\u2011largest eligible company not yet in the index.  Roberts suggests a fintech addition may be less likely this time, noting recent inclusions of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. (IBKR), Block Inc. (XYZ) and Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250905277/sp-500-changes-are-due-out-soon-and-this-could-be-a-big-update)\n\n**MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin Empire Rises, Sizing Up for S&P 500 Inclusion**\nMicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has built a Bitcoin\u2011backed empire that is now a serious candidate for inclusion in the S&P\u202f500.  The company\u2019s unrealized gains of $14\u202fbillion in the last quarter theoretically satisfy the index\u2019s profitability requirement.  If accepted, passive funds tracking the index would be forced to buy roughly 50\u202fmillion shares, worth about $16\u202fbillion at current prices, according to Stephens analysis.  MicroStrategy\u2019s market cap of $22.7\u202fbillion and its high liquidity ratio place it ahead of other potential candidates such as AppLovin, Robinhood and Carvana.  The S&P committee also considers industry balance, and the recent addition of Coinbase Global Inc. and Block Inc. signals growing acceptance of digital\u2011asset companies.  Saylor\u2019s strategy of raising debt and equity to purchase Bitcoin has drawn skepticism, especially after the company\u2019s stock fell 17\u202f% in August and its 30\u2011day volatility reached 96\u202f%, higher than Nvidia\u2019s 77\u202f% and Tesla\u2019s 74\u202f%.  Despite these risks, MicroStrategy\u2019s inclusion could trigger the so\u2011called \"index effect\" and attract passive inflows from large institutional investors.

As of June\u202f30, the company held 597,325\u202fBTC, and the Bitcoin\u2011yield since the start of the year was 19.7\u202f%, a key performance indicator that measures the change in the ratio of BTC held to the diluted number of shares.  In Q2\u202f2025, Strategy reported operating income of $14\u202fbillion and net profit of $10\u202fbillion, translating to $32.6 earnings per diluted share (EPS).  Quarterly revenue was $114.5\u202fmillion, a 2.7\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year increase, while subscription\u2011service revenue rose almost 70\u202f%.  The shift to fair\u2011value accounting in January\u202f2025 allowed the firm to recognize unrealised gains on its digital\u2011asset holdings, directly boosting profitability.  Management has raised its 2025 outlook to $34\u202fbillion operating income, $24\u202fbillion net profit and $80 EPS, assuming Bitcoin ends the year at $150,000.  With a market cap well above the $8.2\u202fbillion threshold, daily trading volume over 250,000 shares, more than 50\u202f% free float, and positive earnings for the last quarter and the trailing twelve months, Strategy meets all S&P\u202f500 eligibility criteria.  The next potential inclusion window is the September\u202f2025 rebalancing, with announcements expected on September\u202f5 and effective changes on September\u202f19.

It also lists the criteria for inclusion: market cap \u2265$22.7\u202fbillion, U.S. headquarters, listing on NYSE, NASDAQ or Cboe, and minimum liquidity and volume, quoting 'The inclusion of a company in the S&P 500 is a decision that a committee guided by a series of criteria.' Robinhood has risen nearly 190% year\u2011to\u2011date and set price records, but was rejected again; MicroStrategy had recently become eligible due to its Bitcoin holdings. The article concludes with a disclaimer that the information does not constitute investment advice.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/robinhood-strategy-shares-dip-miss-sp500-inclusion)\n\n**Will Robinhood or AppLovin fill the open spot in the S&P 500 index after Chevron-Hess shakeup?**\nA high-stakes guessing game is unfolding on Wall Street as investors speculate about which company will fill the open spot in the S&P 500 index after Chevron's acquisition of Hess. According to a Barron's report, both Robinhood Markets and AppLovin Corp are strong contenders to join the index, with market capitalizations of $93 billion and $123 billion, respectively. As investors bet on their potential inclusion, both stocks jumped in early trading, with Robinhood rising over 4% and AppLovin gaining over 3%. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the S&P 500 index, has a history of adding the largest companies not currently in the index, and has a pattern of replacing companies with ones in the same industry. As per Barron's analysis, technology and financials are underrepresented in the index, which could mean a tech or financial company will be added. Cheniere Energy, Carvana, and Ares Management are also potential candidates, but Cheniere might have a higher chance due to its similar market value to Hess and its position in the energy industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 18, 2025 03:37 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/robinhood-stock-news-hood-stock-news-will-robinhood-or-applovin-fill-the-open-spot-in-the-sp-500-index-after-chevron-hess-shakeup-sp500-latest-news/articleshow/122768014.cms)\n\n**AppLovin and Robinhood, Favorites to Join the S&P 500**\nAnalysts predict an increase in the weight of financial values in the market. The S&P 500 has returned to historical highs, with a 26.1% gain since April's lows. The index is slowly recovering positions, closing the gap with European selectives, but is still pending revisions to its composition, which will arrive by the end of the year. Companies that usually enter are the largest in smaller indices, but this unwritten rule leaves five companies on the sidelines, preparing to assault the S&P 500: AppLovin, Robinhood, Carvana, Ares Management, and Cheniere Energy. According to a KBW report, Interactive Brokers could also be a possible incorporation. The favorites are Robinhood and Ares Management, which have a higher chance of being incorporated due to the low weighting of financial sector actions in the index. The entrance to these indices is a boost for companies, increasing their visibility, as it is a common criterion among fund managers and ETFs when entering investment portfolios. KBW estimates that the entrance of these values would lead to a purchase of up to 113 million shares of Robinhood and 31.1 million titles of Ares.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 07, 2025 12:42 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/13452068/07/25/applovin-y-robinhood-a-la-cabeza-en-las-quinielas-para-ser-las-proximas-incorporaciones-en-el-sp-500.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Expert forecasts on whether Ares Management Corporation (ARES) will be announced for inclusion in the S&P 500 before 2026 cluster around a moderately high probability, generally ranging from the low 60s to 80%. Forecasters across specializations\u2014index analysis, finance, economics, and accounting\u2014agree that ARES cleanly satisfies all mechanical eligibility requirements: it has a comfortably large market capitalization, sufficient liquidity and free float, consistent GAAP profitability, and is structured as a U.S.-domiciled C-corporation. Multiple experts highlight that the S&P 500 is currently underweighted in financials, especially alternative asset managers, and recent news/analyst reports (e.g., KBW, Barron's, Economic Times, elEconomista) frequently list ARES as a top candidate to address this gap. \n\nThe main factors increasing ARES\u2019s chances include meeting all eligibility criteria, sector balancing needs favoring financials, explicit recognition as a leading contender by analysts, and the historical pattern that most large, qualified companies are eventually added once a slot opens (usually during quarterly rebalances or after constituent turnover due to M&A). On the other hand, several factors dampen certainty: committee discretion is often exercised unpredictably and has recently resulted in the exclusion of other fully eligible, high-profile firms (e.g., MicroStrategy & Robinhood in earlier cycles), there is robust competition from other large-cap companies (especially in tech and fintech), and only a limited number of new spots may open before 2026 given the timing of previous rebalances. ARES was not selected in the last major rebalance, which lowers odds slightly compared to if it were next in order.\n\nThe modal outlook is therefore that ARES is well-positioned but not a lock: it is widely seen as 'next up' among eligible financials, with high sector and market support, but outcomes depend on discretionary committee choices and the competitive pipeline of candidates. No expert assigns either extremely high or low likelihood; consensus justifies a probability in the 65\u201375% range. Some experts, particularly those focused on earnings quality and accounting transparency, lean more bullish (up to 80%) due to ARES\u2019s 'clean' financials and uncontroversial profile. The minimum cited probability is 22%, which acknowledges recent pass-overs and the base rate of off-cycle additions being rare. \n\nIn summary, most experts expect a 'Yes' outcome, but with recognition that committee unpredictability and candidate competition keep risk above trivial levels.",
