However, public opposition to a federal override (from both parties, family farmers, and significant consumer blocs), plus coalition support\u2014including some major pork companies\u2014has made final passage of such override language doubtful, especially as the Farm Bill faces significant gridlock. Several House Republicans have publicly opposed the override, and it is not clear the Senate would acquiesce. The Farm Bill is not yet passed and remains deeply contentious just ten weeks from the question close date. Judicial threats are real but less likely to yield a near-term suspension, given repeated recent Supreme Court and appellate setbacks for Prop 12 challengers. There is no sign of repeal at the California level, and legislative delays in Congress (including a partial government shutdown) further reduce the likelihood of rapid action. Recent news emphasizes mounting support for Prop 12 among farmers, consumers, and bipartisan politicians, and significant adaptation by industry. Taking all factors into account, there remains some real threat of federal or judicial action, but on base rates, regulatory inertia, political gridlock, and recent pro-Prop 12 jurisprudence, the most probable scenario is that the law remains in effect on January 1, 2026. I moderately discount for the real (but diminishing) risk of a last-minute override, especially via legislative action in a must-pass bill.",

New lawsuits from Triumph Foods and DOJ add noise, but basing probability on recent outcomes, they are unlikely to overturn or stay the law in the next two months. Federal preemption is the most credible threat. However, current news shows deep fissures among congressional Republicans, unusual cross-partisan states\u2019 rights support, and a high level of industry adaptation\u2014all lowering political momentum for repeal or preemption. Further, a prolonged federal shutdown and Farm Bill disarray significantly decrease passage odds of any controversial add-on provision. With about 10 weeks remaining and current enforcement robust, the base rate for a state livestock law surviving to enforcement after Supreme Court affirmation is very high.

My initial forecast was already high-confidence, but after deliberation I see justification for nudging it even higher, reflecting the compounding effect of congressional inertia, cross-partisan resistance to override, and widespread adaptation to the law. I am revising upward to 94%.",

Critiques targeting complacency (notably from AgriculturalRegulation (USDAAnimalWelfareRegulations)) rightly highlight that must-pass bills sometimes host last-minute riders, and that the 'ANY portion' clause adds tail risk. However, these risks were already incorporated in my estimate. Importantly, further group commentary emphasizes just how unlikely major override language is to survive the current legislative and political context\u2014and how little time is left for the courts to act. No new evidence, from discussion or facts, suggests the actual probability for a No outcome is any higher than initially assessed. If anything, the cross-field consensus and continued Farm Bill gridlock make me paradoxically more confident, but not to the point of nudging to a more extreme estimate amid the unpredictable end-of-session congressional dynamics.

The arguments for a lower probability (e.g., mid-80s) were not persuasive enough to warrant dropping my estimate; the only credible critique is continued caution regarding unpredictable 'Christmas tree bill' politics, but all news signals point to a legislative logjam or a Farm Bill passing without the preemption language. Some forecasters even called my 89% 'measured.' No major developments during deliberation indicate greater risk than initially assessed.

Under Proposition 12, not only would production of animal products made under intensive caged farming systems be illegal in the state, but so would the sale of such products (regardless of where they were made).\n\nIn [*National Pork Producers Council v. Ross*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Pork_Producers_Council_v._Ross), a group of farmers and corporations in the pork industry, led by the [National Pork Producers Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Pork_Producers_Council \"National Pork Producers Council\") and the [American Farm Bureau Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Farm_Bureau_Federation \"American Farm Bureau Federation\"), sued the California Department of Food and Agriculture, led by [Karen Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Ross \"Karen Ross\"). They asserted that the proposition violates the [Dormant Commerce Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormant_Commerce_Clause \"Dormant Commerce Clause\"), which prohibits laws that impact interstate commerce. The Biden administration [asked the court](https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-california-pork-law-mandating-more-space-for-pigs/) to overturn the law in order to protect the country's pork industry, but the Supreme Court rejected the Dormant Commerce Clause argument and [upheld](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-468_5if6.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Proposition 12.\n\nAs of 2024, House Republicans [are attempting](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork) to overturn Proposition 12, via the the latest [United States farm bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_farm_bill).\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

He contrasts the interests of large corporate pork producers, represented by the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), with those of small-scale farmers who benefit from higher welfare standards. Maxwell refutes claims that Proposition 12 caused a 41% rise in pork prices, noting that the significant increase occurred years before the law took effect during pandemic-related market corrections. He asserts that retail pork chop prices in California rose only 6.6% since enforcement began in January 2024, a normal market adjustment. Maxwell emphasizes that the law upholds state authority under federalism, affirmed by the Supreme Court, and warns that proposed federal bills like the Food Security and Farm Protection Act and the Save Our Bacon Act would strip states of this right, favoring corporate control. He argues that the real issue is corporate consolidation, weak antitrust enforcement, and vertical integration by multinational packers like Smithfield and JBS, which have reduced U.S. hog farms by over 70% since 1980. Proposition 12, he states, creates a premium market for family farmers investing in higher-welfare systems, with about 27% of producers already compliant. Maxwell concludes that Congress should not 'fix' Proposition 12 but instead address the broken market structures that threaten independent farmers\u2019 livelihoods.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 06:00 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5560964-pork-prices-california-congress/)\n\n**Govt's Independent Animal Welfare Experts Disagreed With Pig Welfare Reforms | Scoop News**\nThe New Zealand government's Animal Welfare Amendment (Regulations of Management of Pigs) Bill, introduced by Minister Damien Hoggard, allows pig farmers to continue using farrowing crates until December 2035, with gradual restrictions\u2014limiting crate use to three days before and four days after birth after that date. This contrasts sharply with the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC)'s 2022 recommendation to fully ban farrowing crates, which it deemed necessary to meet the Animal Welfare Act\u2019s minimum standards. NAWAC chairperson Matthew Stone stated that current practices fall below legal standards and that the proposed changes\u2014such as a 13.3% increase in space for piglets and the provision of 'manipulable and deformable' materials\u2014do not adequately address sows\u2019 need for nest-building behavior. NAWAC had recommended space increases of 56% or 140%, which would allow pigs to lie laterally. Critics, including SPCA chief science advisor Arnja Dale and Green Party spokesperson Steve Abel, argue the government ignored expert advice and misled the public by claiming five years of broad consultation, when the main consultation in 2022 was on a different, more stringent proposal. Hoggard defended the bill, citing a balance between animal welfare and economic feasibility, noting that his proposed $678,000 in capital costs are significantly lower than NAWAC\u2019s estimated $1.57 million. The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) stated over 4,500 public submissions were received, but Dale and Abel argue the consultation was skewed toward industry interests, particularly NZ Pork, with whom Hoggard held at least eight meetings. MPI confirmed NAWAC will be involved in the upcoming Primary Production Committee process, but Stone declined to comment further, stating he would only speak if instructed by the Minister. The bill passed its first reading in Parliament, with Hoggard asserting the reforms would be among the world\u2019s highest, noting only three countries have banned farrowing crates, all with taxpayer-funded subsidies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 07:33 PM\nSource:[scoop.co.nz](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO2510/S00105/govts-independent-animal-welfare-experts-disagreed-with-pig-welfare-reforms.htm)\n\n**Spanish Supreme Court Blocks Europe\u2019s Largest Proposed Pig Farm in Noviercas, Soria**\nThe Spanish Supreme Court has issued a final ruling dismissing the appeal by the company behind the proposed pig farming project in Noviercas, Soria, effectively blocking what would have been Europe's largest intensive livestock farm. The decision was celebrated by environmental organizations Amigas de la Tierra, Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n, Greenpeace, and WWF, who argued the project threatened sustainable food systems, caused animal suffering, and exceeded planetary limits. The project was previously halted by Royal Decree 1053/2022, which set a maximum limit of 850 Large Livestock Units (UGM)\u2014equivalent to about 725 dairy cows and rearing stock\u2014for new or expanded farms across Spain. This measure eliminated the possibility of constructing the Noviercas macrofarm and similar projects. In 2023, Valle de Odieta S.C.L., Ganados Jim\u00e9nez Cambra, and Can Tr\u00e9bol challenged the decree, prompting the environmental groups to intervene as defendants to defend its legality. The Supreme Court had previously dismissed appeals from the other two companies, but the final ruling on Valle de Odieta\u2019s appeal has now been delivered. Jaime Doreste, the lawyer representing the environmental groups, stated, 'The justice has put a final end to what would have been Europe\u2019s largest intensive farm, so we are celebrating. After years of waiting, this ruling arrives at the perfect moment to send a message to society and the sector: intensive farms make no sense in a planet on fire.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[eldiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/castilla-y-leon/tribunales/supremo-tumba-proyecto-construir-mayor-macrogranja-europa-noviercas-soria_1_12693245.html)\n\n**Govt's independent animal welfare experts disagreed with pig welfare reforms**\nNewly released documents reveal that the government's independent animal welfare experts, the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC), disagreed with the revised pig welfare reforms announced by Associate Agriculture Minister Andrew Hoggard on 1 October 2024. The reforms scrapped the previous Labour government\u2019s plan to ban farrowing crates by 18 December 2024, instead allowing their continued use with a phased transition: sows may remain in crates for up to five days before birth and four weeks after, until December 2035, after which the period is reduced to three days before and four days after birth. NAWAC chairperson Matthew Stone stated that the proposed confinement of sows for up to three days prior to farrowing and the lack of meaningful changes to crate design or space allocation failed to meet the minimum standards under the Animal Welfare Act, warning the legislation could face legal challenges. NAWAC had previously recommended a 56% to 140% increase in space, far exceeding the 13.3% increase in the bill. The bill also requires farmers to provide 'manipulable and deformable' materials for nest-building, though no specific materials are defined\u2014SPCA chief science advisor Arnja Dale criticized the vague wording, suggesting it may result in inadequate solutions like hessian sacks. Hoggard defended the reforms, citing five years of consultation, including a 2022 welfare code consultation and targeted discussions with NZ Pork, which held at least eight meetings with him since taking office. However, Dale and Green Party spokesperson Steve Abel accused Hoggard of misleading the public, noting that the 2022 consultation had recommended a complete ban on crates, while the new bill allows restricted use. Abel argued Hoggard prioritized the pork industry over animal welfare. Hoggard claimed the reforms strike a balance between animal welfare and economic feasibility, noting the estimated capital cost of his plan ($678,000) is significantly lower than NAWAC\u2019s recommended changes ($1.57 million). MPI stated over 4,500 public submissions were received, and the final decision reflects a balance between welfare and economic realities. NAWAC has been asked to review the code at the minister\u2019s request, with further advice expected during the Primary Production Committee process. Stone declined further media comment, stating he would only speak if instructed by the minister.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/576140/govt-s-independent-animal-welfare-experts-disagreed-with-pig-welfare-reforms)\n\n**Corporate Ag is losing  --  and the right is waking up**\nWith the Farm Bill deadline approaching, large agricultural lobbyists are attempting to use legislation to overturn California's Proposition 12, a seven-year-old law requiring improved animal welfare standards for farm animals sold in the state. However, an unexpected coalition is emerging: over 200 independent family farmers from 30 states, including companies like Niman Ranch, Heritage Foods, Butcher Box, and White Oak Pastures, have traveled to Washington, D.C., to oppose the 'Save Our Bacon Act' (SOB Act), a rebranded version of the failed EATS Act. The SOB Act, sponsored by Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA), would nullify Prop 12, Massachusetts\u2019s Question 3, and hundreds of other state animal welfare laws, according to a Harvard Law analysis. These state laws, upheld by courts including the U.S. Supreme Court, require space for sows to stand, lie down, and turn around. Farmers have invested millions in infrastructure and created jobs to comply. Even JBS, the second-largest U.S. pork producer, is largely compliant. Fourteen House Republicans, led by Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Nancy Mace, have warned the SOB Act undermines states' rights, harms family farmers, and increases foreign control over U.S. food. General Michael Flynn called it a 'national security threat.' Former EATS Act sponsor Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) admitted on RFD-TV that 'we're getting the heck beat out of us' and declined to reintroduce the bill. Prop 12 has survived nine legal challenges, and the Department of Justice recently sued California on behalf of corporate interests, highlighting the entrenched opposition. Yet, support is growing: consumer demand for animal welfare is accelerating, and the law reflects voter choice, not government overreach. The irony is that Prop 12 aligns with conservative values like states' rights, consumer freedom, and local control. It also supports public health\u2014better animal treatment reduces stress, disease, and antibiotic use. Republicans have previously advanced animal welfare, including Trump\u2019s federal ban on animal cruelty and Kennedy\u2019s efforts to end NIH animal testing. The corporate agriculture strategy of rebranding failed legislation is failing. The growing alliance of farmers, conservatives, and consumers now sees fair competition, not federal interference, as the future of American food. Farmers have invested, voters have spoken, and the tide is turning. As Butcher Box CEO Mike Salguero stated, undermining Prop 12 punishes those who complied and betrays consumer choice. The right is waking up: defending Prop 12 is about protecting free markets, states\u2019 rights, and public health\u2014not letting Washington decide what\u2019s on our plates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 02:28 PM\nSource:[American Thinker](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2025/10/corporate_ag_is_losing_and_the_right_is_waking_up.html)\n\n**Farmers are defending the law big pork wants to destroy**\nJoe Maxwell, a fourth-generation Missouri hog farmer and president of Farm Action Fund, defends California's Proposition 12, which establishes minimum space standards for animals sold in California, arguing it is not a threat to independent family farmers but rather a market opportunity.

In a filing on October 18, 2025, the Justice Department argued that a district court judge in Illinois, April Perry, had improperly substituted her judgment for the President's on military matters under Section 12406 of federal law, which permits federalization when there is a breakdown of law and order. Judge Perry had ruled on October 9, 2025, that there was no evidence of such a breakdown, noting that federal agents who were threatened or assaulted had already been arrested. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to block the deployment but affirmed the President\u2019s authority to federalize troops. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asserted that the district court lacked both authority and competence to override the Commander in Chief\u2019s control over the military chain of command. The administration has faced multiple legal challenges in deploying National Guard and federal agents to Illinois, Oregon, and California, with the Ninth Circuit recently allowing federalization in Oregon but not deployment due to ongoing violence. The administration denies allegations of violating the Posse Comitatus Act in California, where National Guard and Marine units were deployed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:48 AM\nSource:[InfoWars](https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-rule-on-nat-guard-deployment-to-chicago)\n\n**Color manufacturing group sues WV officials over ban on food dyes**\nThe International Association of Color Manufacturers (IACM) filed a lawsuit on October 6, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against several state officials, including Department of Health Secretary Arvin Singh, Interim Bureau of Health Commissioner Justin Davis, Superintendent of Schools Michele Blatt, and members of the West Virginia Board of Education. The lawsuit challenges House Bill 2354, signed into law by Governor Patrick Morrisey in March 2025, which bans the use of six synthetic food color additives\u2014FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 5, FD&C Yellow No. 6, FD&C Blue No. 1, FD&C Blue No. 2, and other ingredients\u2014in food and beverages sold in general commerce starting January 1, 2028, and in school meals beginning in 2028. The IACM argues that the law violates the U.S. and West Virginia constitutions by usurping the FDA\u2019s authority over food safety, interfering with interstate commerce, and causing economic harm without a rational or scientific basis. The group asserts that these dyes have been evaluated and approved as safe by the FDA, the European Food Safety Agency, Health Canada, and the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives for decades. The complaint states that the law lacks any scientific evidence, legislative findings, or robust record to justify the ban and calls it a 'pseudoscientific fad' driven by arbitrary political action. The IACM also claims the law creates consumer confusion, increases food costs, and imposes significant technical and supply chain challenges in replacing synthetic dyes with natural alternatives, which are not a simple substitute. The group warns the ban may reduce the appeal of healthy food options and complicate schools\u2019 ability to meet federal nutrition standards. IACM seeks a court order declaring HB 2354 unconstitutional and unenforceable, enjoining its implementation, and recovering court costs and attorney fees.

The U.S. Department of Education (ED) published the 2023 Gainful Employment Rule (GE Rule), which uses debt-to-earnings and earnings premium tests to assess program value; after two lawsuits from cosmetology schools challenged the rule as exceeding statutory authority and being arbitrary and capricious, the Northern District of Texas upheld the rule on October 2, 2025, ruling that 'gainful employment' reasonably means profitable employment and that ED\u2019s use of IRS data and cost-benefit analysis was rational. The 2023 GE Rule remains in effect nationwide. The 'Bare Minimum Rule' (BMR), which restricted Title IV aid to programs meeting state licensure minimums, was enjoined nationwide by the Northern District of Texas in June 2024 due to its departure from 30 years of precedent; ED has since stayed the litigation and plans to reconsider the rule via negotiated rulemaking, with the case stayed until January 21, 2026. The 2022 Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDR) Rule faced a nationwide injunction by the Fifth Circuit in April 2024; the Supreme Court reviewed the issue but dismissed the case on August 8, 2025, after Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which restored pre-2020 regulations and invalidated the BDR provisions. The SAVE Plan, which offered 10-year loan forgiveness, remains enjoined due to lack of statutory authority, and the OBBB has replaced it, with interest resuming on August 1, 2025. A proposed rule for loan forgiveness under a different statute was withdrawn in December 2024, and litigation remains active over whether a live case or controversy exists. The 2024 Title IX Rule, which expanded protections to include gender identity and sexual orientation, was vacated nationwide by the Eastern District of Kentucky on January 9, 2025, on grounds of exceeding statutory authority and violating the First Amendment; ED has not appealed, and pending appeals in other circuits are being reviewed in light of the ruling. Upcoming Supreme Court cases\u2014Little v. Hecox and B.P.J. v. West Virginia\u2014will determine whether state bans on transgender athletes in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports violate the Equal Protection Clause or Title IX.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on October 18, 2025, argues that the law usurps the NLRB\u2019s exclusive federal authority by regulating areas reserved for federal oversight. This action mirrors the NLRB\u2019s prior legal challenge to a similar New York law. The NLRB contends that such state laws create conflicting parallel regulatory systems that undermine federal labor law. The crisis stems from the January 2025 firing of Democratic NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox by President Trump, which left the board without a quorum, effectively paralyzing its ability to rule on cases. Although Wilcox has challenged her firing in court, the Supreme Court has upheld the dismissal for now. California lawmakers and labor advocates, including Lorena Gonzalez, president of the California Federation of Labor Unions, argue AB 288 is essential to fill a critical gap, calling it 'the most significant labor law reform in nearly a century.' The law will take effect on January 1, 2026, allowing private-sector workers to petition the state board when federal cases have been pending for over six months, or when the NLRB lacks a quorum. The NLRB\u2019s acting general counsel, William Cowen, a Trump appointee, claims the agency\u2019s operations remain largely functional, with regional offices continuing to process union elections and unfair labor practice charges, asserting that only a small fraction of cases require full board decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 01:48 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/nlrb-sues-california-over-law-014844112.html)\n\n**Beltway Buzz, October 17, 2025**\nAs of October 17, 2025, the U.S. federal government has been partially shut down for 17 days with no clear political path to reopening. The U.S. Senate has attempted, and failed, to pass a continuing resolution ten times. Senators John Fetterman (D-PA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Angus King (I-ME) continue to support the resolution, while Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) opposes it. Republicans are seeking five additional Democratic votes to pass the measure. Meanwhile, E-Verify has resumed operations during the shutdown, requiring employers to create new cases for employees hired while the system was down by October 14, 2025. On immigration, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the 2015 H-4 EAD rule, preserving a 2024 D.C. Circuit decision that affirmed the rule\u2019s validity under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Biden administration did not pursue rescinding the rule, and it remains on the Unified Agenda without any current plans for revision, though a future Trump administration could propose changes. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill No. 288, expanding the Public Employee Relations Board (PERB) to handle private-sector union elections, unfair labor practice charges, and remedies\u2014actions previously reserved for the NLRB. The NLRB sued California, arguing the law preempts federal labor law under the National Labor Relations Act. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, also criticized the law in a letter to Newsom, demanding details on implementation and warning that state actions undermine federal worker protections. On a separate note, October 17, 2025, marked the 45th anniversary of the Staggers Rail Act, which deregulated freight railroads, allowing them to negotiate rates and restructure services, leading to lower shipping costs, infrastructure investment, and the survival of the U.S. freight rail industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/beltway-buzz-october-17-2025)\n\n**Govt's Independent Animal Welfare Experts Disagreed With Pig Welfare Reforms | Scoop News**\nThe New Zealand government's Animal Welfare Amendment (Regulations of Management of Pigs) Bill, introduced by Minister Damien Hoggard, allows pig farmers to continue using farrowing crates until December 2035, with gradual restrictions\u2014limiting crate use to three days before and four days after birth after that date. This contrasts sharply with the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC)'s 2022 recommendation to fully ban farrowing crates, which it deemed necessary to meet the Animal Welfare Act\u2019s minimum standards. NAWAC chairperson Matthew Stone stated that current practices fall below legal standards and that the proposed changes\u2014such as a 13.3% increase in space for piglets and the provision of 'manipulable and deformable' materials\u2014do not adequately address sows\u2019 need for nest-building behavior. NAWAC had recommended space increases of 56% or 140%, which would allow pigs to lie laterally. Critics, including SPCA chief science advisor Arnja Dale and Green Party spokesperson Steve Abel, argue the government ignored expert advice and misled the public by claiming five years of broad consultation, when the main consultation in 2022 was on a different, more stringent proposal. Hoggard defended the bill, citing a balance between animal welfare and economic feasibility, noting that his proposed $678,000 in capital costs are significantly lower than NAWAC\u2019s estimated $1.57 million. The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) stated over 4,500 public submissions were received, but Dale and Abel argue the consultation was skewed toward industry interests, particularly NZ Pork, with whom Hoggard held at least eight meetings. MPI confirmed NAWAC will be involved in the upcoming Primary Production Committee process, but Stone declined to comment further, stating he would only speak if instructed by the Minister. The bill passed its first reading in Parliament, with Hoggard asserting the reforms would be among the world\u2019s highest, noting only three countries have banned farrowing crates, all with taxpayer-funded subsidies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 07:33 PM\nSource:[scoop.co.nz](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO2510/S00105/govts-independent-animal-welfare-experts-disagreed-with-pig-welfare-reforms.htm)\n\n**Spanish Supreme Court Blocks Europe\u2019s Largest Proposed Pig Farm in Noviercas, Soria**\nThe Spanish Supreme Court has issued a final ruling dismissing the appeal by the company behind the proposed pig farming project in Noviercas, Soria, effectively blocking what would have been Europe's largest intensive livestock farm. The decision was celebrated by environmental organizations Amigas de la Tierra, Ecologistas en Acci\u00f3n, Greenpeace, and WWF, who argued the project threatened sustainable food systems, caused animal suffering, and exceeded planetary limits. The project was previously halted by Royal Decree 1053/2022, which set a maximum limit of 850 Large Livestock Units (UGM)\u2014equivalent to about 725 dairy cows and rearing stock\u2014for new or expanded farms across Spain. This measure eliminated the possibility of constructing the Noviercas macrofarm and similar projects. In 2023, Valle de Odieta S.C.L., Ganados Jim\u00e9nez Cambra, and Can Tr\u00e9bol challenged the decree, prompting the environmental groups to intervene as defendants to defend its legality. The Supreme Court had previously dismissed appeals from the other two companies, but the final ruling on Valle de Odieta\u2019s appeal has now been delivered. Jaime Doreste, the lawyer representing the environmental groups, stated, 'The justice has put a final end to what would have been Europe\u2019s largest intensive farm, so we are celebrating.

The reforms scrapped the previous Labour government\u2019s plan to ban farrowing crates by 18 December 2024, instead allowing their continued use with a phased transition: sows may remain in crates for up to five days before birth and four weeks after, until December 2035, after which the period is reduced to three days before and four days after birth. NAWAC chairperson Matthew Stone stated that the proposed confinement of sows for up to three days prior to farrowing and the lack of meaningful changes to crate design or space allocation failed to meet the minimum standards under the Animal Welfare Act, warning the legislation could face legal challenges. NAWAC had previously recommended a 56% to 140% increase in space, far exceeding the 13.3% increase in the bill. The bill also requires farmers to provide 'manipulable and deformable' materials for nest-building, though no specific materials are defined\u2014SPCA chief science advisor Arnja Dale criticized the vague wording, suggesting it may result in inadequate solutions like hessian sacks. Hoggard defended the reforms, citing five years of consultation, including a 2022 welfare code consultation and targeted discussions with NZ Pork, which held at least eight meetings with him since taking office. However, Dale and Green Party spokesperson Steve Abel accused Hoggard of misleading the public, noting that the 2022 consultation had recommended a complete ban on crates, while the new bill allows restricted use. Abel argued Hoggard prioritized the pork industry over animal welfare. Hoggard claimed the reforms strike a balance between animal welfare and economic feasibility, noting the estimated capital cost of his plan ($678,000) is significantly lower than NAWAC\u2019s recommended changes ($1.57 million). MPI stated over 4,500 public submissions were received, and the final decision reflects a balance between welfare and economic realities. NAWAC has been asked to review the code at the minister\u2019s request, with further advice expected during the Primary Production Committee process. Stone declined further media comment, stating he would only speak if instructed by the minister.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/576140/govt-s-independent-animal-welfare-experts-disagreed-with-pig-welfare-reforms)\n\n**Corporate Ag is losing  --  and the right is waking up**\nWith the Farm Bill deadline approaching, large agricultural lobbyists are attempting to use legislation to overturn California's Proposition 12, a seven-year-old law requiring improved animal welfare standards for farm animals sold in the state. However, an unexpected coalition is emerging: over 200 independent family farmers from 30 states, including companies like Niman Ranch, Heritage Foods, Butcher Box, and White Oak Pastures, have traveled to Washington, D.C., to oppose the 'Save Our Bacon Act' (SOB Act), a rebranded version of the failed EATS Act. The SOB Act, sponsored by Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA), would nullify Prop 12, Massachusetts\u2019s Question 3, and hundreds of other state animal welfare laws, according to a Harvard Law analysis. These state laws, upheld by courts including the U.S. Supreme Court, require space for sows to stand, lie down, and turn around. Farmers have invested millions in infrastructure and created jobs to comply. Even JBS, the second-largest U.S. pork producer, is largely compliant. Fourteen House Republicans, led by Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Nancy Mace, have warned the SOB Act undermines states' rights, harms family farmers, and increases foreign control over U.S. food. General Michael Flynn called it a 'national security threat.' Former EATS Act sponsor Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) admitted on RFD-TV that 'we're getting the heck beat out of us' and declined to reintroduce the bill. Prop 12 has survived nine legal challenges, and the Department of Justice recently sued California on behalf of corporate interests, highlighting the entrenched opposition. Yet, support is growing: consumer demand for animal welfare is accelerating, and the law reflects voter choice, not government overreach. The irony is that Prop 12 aligns with conservative values like states' rights, consumer freedom, and local control. It also supports public health\u2014better animal treatment reduces stress, disease, and antibiotic use. Republicans have previously advanced animal welfare, including Trump\u2019s federal ban on animal cruelty and Kennedy\u2019s efforts to end NIH animal testing. The corporate agriculture strategy of rebranding failed legislation is failing. The growing alliance of farmers, conservatives, and consumers now sees fair competition, not federal interference, as the future of American food. Farmers have invested, voters have spoken, and the tide is turning. As Butcher Box CEO Mike Salguero stated, undermining Prop 12 punishes those who complied and betrays consumer choice. The right is waking up: defending Prop 12 is about protecting free markets, states\u2019 rights, and public health\u2014not letting Washington decide what\u2019s on our plates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 02:28 PM\nSource:[American Thinker](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2025/10/corporate_ag_is_losing_and_the_right_is_waking_up.html)\n\n**Massachusetts is taking its victory in Triumph Foods v. Campbell to Washington D.C.**\nMassachusetts is advancing its legal defense of Question 3 (Q3), a 2016 ballot initiative that bans the sale of pork, eggs, and veal from animals confined in cages too small to turn around or extend their limbs, following a favorable ruling in the Triump Foods v. Campbell case by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The 47-page decision upheld the Massachusetts Act, stating it does not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause because it does not prohibit out-of-state farming practices\u2014only the sale of products from such practices within Massachusetts\u2014and thus does not constitute a 'policy of hostility' toward states with Right to Farm laws. The court also ruled that Q3 does not preempt the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA). This follows the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 30, 2024, denial of the Iowa Pork Producers Association\u2019s (IPPA) appeal of a prior Ninth Circuit ruling that upheld California\u2019s Proposition 12. Prop 12, passed in 2018 and fully implemented in 2024, requires minimum space standards: 24 square feet per sow, 43 square feet per veal calf, and cage-free housing for laying hens. Supporters like Brent Hershey, president of Hershey Ag, report improved farm resilience and productivity under Prop 12. Russ Kremer, a Missouri hog farmer, and Mike Salguero, CEO of ButcherBox, emphasized that Prop 12 supports family farmers and aligns with growing consumer demand for animal welfare. The House Committee on Agriculture held a full hearing on July 23, 2025, on the economic impact of Prop 12.

The coalition is defending California\u2019s Proposition 12 and Massachusetts\u2019s Question 3\u2014laws that ban gestation crates and mandate humane animal housing. A lifelike pig in a gestation crate will be displayed to highlight the controversial practice. Farmers and companies, including Perdue Farms (Niman Ranch, Coleman All Natural Meats), True Story Foods, ButcherBox, and Feathered Acres Learning Farm & Inn, emphasize that Prop. 12 has improved farm resilience, animal health, and market access, with 27% of U.S. pork producers adopting or working toward compliance. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Prop. 12 in 2023. Public opinion strongly supports the ban, with 63% of Californians and 78% of Massachusetts voters approving the laws, and 69% of Americans opposing gestation crates. Farmers and business leaders warn that overturning these laws would punish ethical producers, undermine state rights, and harm family farms.

These bills aim to overturn state-level humane farming laws, which farmers argue would devastate family farms that have invested in crate-free systems and undermine states\u2019 rights to regulate agriculture. Russ Kremer, a Missouri hog farmer and Head of Farm Partnerships for True Story Foods, stated that Prop 12 is a 'lifeline' for small farms amid industry consolidation. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge by the Iowa Pork Producers Association (IPPA) in June 2024, following a June 2024 ruling by the 9th Circuit Court in favor of Prop 12. In May 2023, the court also ruled against the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) in a similar challenge. Prop 12, approved by California voters in 2018, prohibits the sale of eggs, raw pork, and veal from animals housed below minimum space standards, with full implementation in 2024. It requires 43 square feet per veal calf, 24 square feet per sow, and cage-free housing for laying hens. Brent Hershey, president of Hershey Ag, said his farm is Prop-12-certified and has improved productivity and resilience since adoption. The House Committee on Agriculture held a hearing on July 23, 2025, on the economic impact of Prop 12, with testimony from industry groups like NPPC on compliance costs and market effects. Support for Prop 12 has come from major meat companies including Perdue Farms, Niman Ranch, Coleman All Natural Meats, True Story Foods, and ButcherBox, with ButcherBox CEO Mike Salguero stating that undermining Prop 12 would punish farmers who invested in animal welfare and consumers who voted for ethical practices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[Meat+Poultry](https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/32574-meat-businesses-hog-farms-go-to-washington-for-support-of-prop-12)\n\n**Big Ag's propaganda can't hide truth about California's Proposition 12**\nThe article criticizes Jack Hubbard's critique of California's Proposition 12, calling it a misleading defense of large industrial pork corporations. Proposition 12, passed by 63% of California voters in 2018, requires that pigs used for breeding in California or sold in the state must have enough space to stand, turn around, and extend their legs\u2014conditions that do not ban pork or bacon. The law applies equally to in-state and out-of-state producers, leveling the playing field for family farmers who already practice humane methods. The article notes that nearly 5,000 farms across 39 states support Prop 12's standards, and that family farmers benefit from higher herd health and profitability under these conditions. Despite claims of price spikes, data shows that price increases were temporary and tied to broader inflation, labor shortages, and pandemic-related supply chain disruptions; by 2024, prices had stabilized. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Prop 12 in National Pork Producers Council v. Ross (2023) and rejected a subsequent industry challenge, affirming states' rights to set humane food standards. A 2022 national poll found 80% of voters support similar laws, and Massachusetts passed a nearly identical measure (Question 3) by over 70% in 2016. The article concludes that Prop 12 reflects mainstream American values, is legally sound, and represents progress toward humane, transparent food systems, while labeling Hubbard\u2019s argument as a corporate talking point designed to protect industrial animal agriculture.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 04:06 PM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/2/big-ags-propaganda-cant-hide-truth-californias-proposition-12/)\n\n**Triumph Foods wants out from under Prop 12**\nTriumph Foods, a farmer-owned processor of premium pork products and the successful plaintiff in a prior challenge to Massachusetts Question 3, has become the first processor to sue California over Proposition 12 (Prop 12), which bans the sale of eggs and pork in California unless they are produced under the state\u2019s animal housing regulations. The lawsuit argues that Prop 12 violates the dormant Commerce Clause, just as the Massachusetts law (Question 3) was previously struck down. Triumph Foods claims that federal regulation\u2014specifically by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014already governs its operations, and that state laws like Prop 12 interfere with Congress\u2019s preemptive authority over the national food supply. The company cites the 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in National Meat Ass\u2019n v. Harris, which held that state laws usurping federal authority over food production are unconstitutional. Triumph\u2019s claims expand on those made by the U.S. Department of Justice, which has already challenged Prop 12\u2019s egg provisions. Despite the Supreme Court declining to hear an appeal from the Iowa Pork Producers Association (IPPA) earlier in 2025, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had previously denied the IPPA\u2019s case.

The company argues that the law oversteps federal authority because USDA\u2011inspected plants already meet required safety and animal\u2011welfare standards.

In a letter to House Ag Committee Chair Glenn 'GT' Thompson and Ranking Member Angie\u202fCraig, the lawmakers warned that the Save the Bacon Act would \"erode states' rights, undermine family farmers, and expand foreign influence over U.S. food production.\" Prop\u202f12, upheld by the Supreme Court in 2023, requires pork sold in California to come from sows not raised in gestation crates; compliance was mandated for all California swine farms and those selling into the California market as of January\u202f2024. Rep. Ashley\u202fHinson introduced the Save the Bacon Act in July to prohibit state and local governments from interfering with livestock production in other states. The letter was signed by Reps. David\u202fValadao (CA), Anna\u202fPaulina\u202fLuna (FL), Andrew\u202fGarbarino (NY) and others, including Gus\u202fBilirakis, Vern\u202fBuchanan, Byron\u202fDonalds, Carlos\u202fGimenez, Young\u202fKim, Michael\u202fLawler, Nancy\u202fMace and Brian\u202fFitzpatrick. None of the signers sit on the House Ag Committee. The lawmakers cited concerns over Chinese\u2011owned Smithfield Foods, which controls about a quarter of the U.S. pork market, arguing that \"It is imperative to ensure that American farmers - not foreign governments - maintain control over U.S. domestic food production and supply chains to safeguard national interests.\" They warned that enacting the EATS Act could \"further consolidate the influence of such foreign entities, granting them greater control over the U.S. agricultural sector and limiting the capacity of individual states to regulate their own food supplies.\" The National Pork Producers Council and American Farm Bureau Federation warned that Proposition\u202f12 and similar laws could create a patchwork of regulations across the country. \"The success of American agriculture has always depended on striking the right balance between federal and state responsibilities,\" the letter said. \"Congress must uphold this principle as it moves forward.\" Thompson told Agri\u2011Pulse that the Save the Bacon Act would \"respect states' rights to do internally whatever the states want to do.\" Angi\u202fCraig, who did not sign the act, said it is \"untenable for us to continue with 50 states having 50 different laws in this country\" and called for a bipartisan solution that does not punish those already invested in Prop\u202f12 compliance.

Don\u202fDavis (NC), who argued the legislation is necessary to allow pork producers to raise animals without Prop\u202f12 constraints.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 07:36 PM\nSource:[Agri-Pulse Communications](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/23480-more-than-a-dozen-house-republicans-oppose-prop-12-fix)\n\n**Republican Lawmakers Declare Opposition to Legislation to Overturn the States' Most Important Farm Animal Welfare Laws**\nOn September 17, 2025, 14 Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to the House Agriculture Committee urging the exclusion of the Save Our Bacon (SOB) Act, formerly the EATS Act, from any upcoming Farm Bill. The SOB Act would override state laws such as California\u2019s Proposition 12 and Massachusetts\u2019s Question 3 that require pork to be produced without gestation crates. The letter argues that the act would strip states of regulatory authority, invite foreign influence\u2014particularly from China\u2014and undermine American agricultural sovereignty. It cites that Smithfield Foods, owned by a Chinese company, now controls one quarter of U.S. domestic pig production. Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action, claims that up to 45% of sows are raised outside gestation crates and that repeal of Prop 12 and Question 3 would push thousands of farmers into crisis, affecting 50\u202fmillion consumers. The Supreme Court upheld Prop 12 in May\u202f2023, and the SOB Act has failed in every Congress for nearly 15\u202fyears. The letter is supported by a science\u2011based report from Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy, which lists seven core findings against the SOB Act.\n\nKey quotes: 'play a critical role in ensuring fair competition, food safety, and public trust,' wrote the Republican lawmakers. 'If Prop 12 and Question 3 are repealed, thousands of farmers supplying pork to 50 million American consumers will go into crisis and then perhaps into bankruptcy,' added Pacelle. 'Enacting the EATS Act could further consolidate the influence of such foreign entities, granting them greater control over the U.S. agricultural sector and limiting the capacity of individual states to regulate their own food supplies,' wrote the lawmakers. 'A solid majority of Republicans and Democrats in the House understand that the SOB Act is a frontal attack on U.S. elections and an invitation for China to expand its unprecedented level of control over domestic pig production,' said Wayne Pacelle. 'Up to 45% of sows are raised outside of gestation crates for the largest share of their period of pregnancy.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 17, 2025 02:42 PM\nSource:[EIN News](https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/849928860/republican-lawmakers-declare-opposition-to-legislation-to-overturn-the-states-most-important-farm-animal-welfare-laws)\n\n**U.S. Supreme Court rejects Prop 12 case**\nAccording to the article, 'The high court on June 30 rejected another challenge to California\u2019s controversial animal\u2011welfare law, two years after narrowly upholding the state\u2019s requirements on the sale of pork products.' The Iowa Pork Producers Association had argued that the law discriminates against out\u2011of\u2011state producers, a claim based on a legal standard concerning when state laws overly restrict interstate commerce. The Supreme Court had previously dismissed a similar challenge in 2023 brought by the National Pork Producers Council that relied on the same standard. The case centered on Proposition 12, a 2018 ballot initiative that bans the sale of pork products in California unless the sow from which the butchered pig was born was housed in at least 24 square feet of floor space.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 01, 2025 03:46 PM\nSource:[wglr.com](https://www.wglr.com/2025/07/01/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-prop-12-case/)\n\n**Supreme Court upholds Prop 12 in California**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld California\u2019s Proposition 12, a law regulating animal confinement, in a 5-4 decision against the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) and the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), who had challenged the law on grounds that it violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The ruling affirmed lower court decisions, including a 2021 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that had previously rejected the challenge. Under Prop 12, veal calves must have at least 43 sq. ft. of usable floor space per animal, sows must have a minimum of 24 sq. ft., and laying hens must be cage-free. The NPPC expressed disappointment, stating the ruling would increase consumer prices, harm small farms, and lead to industry consolidation, and vowed to continue opposing the law. The North American Meat Institute echoed this sentiment, calling Prop 12 a costly burden with no benefit to animals or consumers, and said it would study the ruling to determine next steps. In contrast, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) welcomed the decision, with President Kitty Block stating that the ruling affirms states\u2019 authority to prevent animal cruelty and protect public health. The dissenting justices were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2023 12:00 AM\nSource:[meatpoultry.com](https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/28456-supreme-court-upholds-prop-12-in-california)\n\n",

    "summary": "The experts forecast a high probability that California\u2019s Proposition 12 will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, citing several converging lines of reasoning. The dominant threat to the law is federal legislative preemption, most likely via the 2024 Farm Bill or similar provisions (such as the Save Our Bacon Act) targeting state-level animal welfare standards. However, Congressional gridlock\u2014exacerbated by a government shutdown and bipartisan opposition (including a bloc of House Republicans)\u2014makes near-term passage of such preemptive language unlikely. Judicial threats are also present through ongoing litigation (e.g., by Triumph Foods and the DOJ), but these are mostly considered low-probability risks in the short remaining time, given repeated Supreme Court and appellate court rejections of similar legal arguments. On the administrative and political front, Prop 12 enjoys strong popular support in California, solidified implementation, and broad compliance among producers, which dampens pressure for repeal. A unique coalition of family farmers, major agri-businesses, and consumer advocates with bipartisan legislative support further weakens federal override efforts. The panel agrees that although a last-minute federal bill or court injunction\u2014affecting even part of Prop 12\u2014would result in a 'No' outcome, such developments are increasingly unlikely as the deadline approaches. Expert probability estimates range from 83% to 92% that Prop 12 will remain fully in effect, with most clustering in the mid- to high-80s. The overall consensus is that the law\u2019s endurance is likely given current legislative, judicial, industry, and political trajectories, but some minor tail risk is retained due to high-impact, low-probability legislative or judicial surprises.",
