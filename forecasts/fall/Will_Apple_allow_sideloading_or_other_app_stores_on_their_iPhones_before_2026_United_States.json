The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn 14 September 2022 the [Regulation 2022/1925 on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (better known as the Digital Markets Act or DMA) was adopted](https://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/cl5qyuy0o1h0y0a59y4osbiqx/digital-markets-act-is-adopted). Its primary aim are issues regarding [contestability and fairness in the digital economy](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/digital-markets-act-dma-goes-live), with a focus on prohibitions and obligations imposed upon Big Tech. The DMA impacts a wide variety of companies such as Amazon, Google, or Apple, with an anticipated enforcement date of March 2024.\n\nThe [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/0c2d56f7-a402-45ea-8aa6-0e05e6260b68) reported that the DMA represents the \u201cbiggest threat to [Apple\u2019s] control over its operating system in 15 years\u201d. \n\n> Apple is laying the groundwork to comply with tough new EU rules that will allow iPhone users to pick apps from beyond its own App Store, as developers seek to skirt the up to 30 per cent fee imposed by the US tech giant.\n\nThis comes against the backdrop of Apple\u2019s legal fight with Fortnite maker Epic Games about Epic\u2019s own app store that resulted in Apple pulling Fortnite from their App Store. The DMA may make it illegal for Apple to prohibit other app stores on their phones.\n\nHowever, as the [Financial Times]( https://www.ft.com/content/0c2d56f7-a402-45ea-8aa6-0e05e6260b68) reports, a potential workaround for Apple could be \u201csideloading\u201d, where users are able to install software directly via a browser (without using rival app stores). \n\nWhile the DMA only applies to the EU, there is also the possibility of a regulatory spill-over to other jurisdictions.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":14135,\"question_id\":14137}}`",

Apple's lawyer, Daniel Beard, presented three main objections before the General Court in Luxembourg: first, that interoperability requirements forcing iPhone services to work with rival hardware threaten user privacy, security, and intellectual property; second, that the App Store should not be subject to DMA rules because it does not constitute a 'single service' under the law's definition; and third, that the EU's attempt to investigate iMessage under the DMA was unjustified, as it does not directly generate revenue. EU Commission lawyer Paul-John Loewenthal countered that Apple's 'absolute control' over the iPhone ecosystem has enabled 'supernormal profits' and created an uneven playing field, locking in over a third of European smartphone users. The DMA, enacted in 2023, targets dominant digital platforms with strict obligations. Apple is also challenging a \u20ac500 million ($581 million) fine related to the App Store, following a previous \u20ac1.8 billion antitrust penalty for similar conduct. Other tech giants, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Booking Holdings, have also been affected. Apple\u2019s case is the most direct assault on the DMA\u2019s enforcement, following an earlier setback for ByteDance over TikTok. The EU has issued over \u20ac9.5 billion in fines against Google and ordered Apple to pay \u20ac13 billion in back taxes to Ireland.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 05:40 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/apple-challenges-eu-digital-markets-act-in-biggest-antitrust-court-test-125102100940_1.html)\n\n**Apple Challenges EU Digital Markets Act at European Court**\nApple has filed a formal complaint before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg against the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), according to Bloomberg. Apple's legal team criticized the DMA rules as excessively burdensome, specifically opposing three provisions: mandatory interoperability with third-party hardware, inclusion of the App Store under DMA regulations, and an ongoing investigation into the iMessage messaging service. In response, the European Commission's legal representative argued that Apple has generated above-average profits through exclusive control of the iPhone ecosystem and has locked in more than one-third of European smartphone users. The dispute has a long history: in April 2025, Apple was fined \u20ac500 million for allegedly violating DMA rules, following a prior \u20ac1.8 billion penalty for anti-competitive behavior related to music streaming apps. While other tech giants\u2014including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Booking Holdings\u2014are also subject to the DMA, Apple's complaint is considered the most aggressive legal challenge to date. ByteDance's similar attempt to challenge TikTok\u2019s inclusion under the DMA had previously failed.

Apple contested the 2023 decision labeling its iPhone software and App Store as core platform services, arguing that compliance with the DMA\u2019s interoperability requirements would compromise its intellectual property, privacy, and security. Apple attorney Daniel Beard claimed that exposing software code and trade secrets would amount to a 'deprivation of a key part of that right.' The European Commission countered that Apple had not identified any specific intellectual property at risk and emphasized that the DMA balances competition with fundamental rights. Intervening groups, including the European Parliament, the Council, Free Software Foundation Europe, and the Coalition for App Fairness, supported the Commission, stressing that interoperability is essential for fair competition. Disputes also centered on Apple\u2019s argument that its App Stores for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Watch, and TV serve distinct audiences and should not be treated as a single gateway\u2014contrary to the Commission\u2019s view that they function as one unified ecosystem. Additionally, the Commission\u2019s probe into iMessage as a 'number-independent interpersonal communications service' was challenged by Apple, which argued the app is free, ad-free, and non-commercial, thus not qualifying under the DMA. The Commission responded that iMessage indirectly boosts device sales and therefore falls under the law. The court examined whether the gatekeeper designation immediately imposes binding duties, with Apple claiming it does, and the Commission asserting that some aspects of the challenge involve preparatory steps without legal effect. A judgment is expected in 2026. The outcome will determine the extent of Apple\u2019s control over its App Store and devices, test the enforceability of the DMA, and set a precedent for other tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta. The case reflects a broader struggle over who defines fairness in the digital economy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 12:46 PM\nSource:[Court House News Service](https://www.courthousenews.com/apples-walled-garden-faces-european-court-challenge-to-its-digital-empire/)\n\n**Apple again attacks the European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act**\nApple has challenged the European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) before the EU\u2019s General Court in Luxembourg, arguing that the regulation imposes unlawful obligations on the company, including changes to the iPhone, iMessage, and the App Store.

The company contests three core aspects of the DMA: (1) requirements for rival hardware manufacturers to interoperate with iPhones, which Apple claims threatens security and intellectual property; (2) the classification of its App Store as a 'gatekeeper service,' which Apple argues is unjustified; and (3) the EU's investigation direction that would bring iMessage under the DMA's scope. Apple's legal team described the DMA as imposing 'hugely onerous and intrusive burdens' on its rights under EU law. The European Commission countered that Apple's control over its ecosystem has generated 'supernormal profits' and unfairly restricted competition. The DMA, which became fully enforceable in 2023, targets dominant tech firms by mandating platform openness, fair treatment of business users, and non-discrimination against third-party services. Apple's case is the first broad-scale legal challenge to the DMA, making it a landmark test of the regulation's enforceability.

Apple argues the DMA imposes 'extremely burdensome and intrusive restrictions' that undermine its legitimate rights in the European market. The company's lawyer, Daniel Beard, claimed the law disregards core EU values such as property rights, privacy, and security. Apple's three main demands include opposing mandatory interoperability requirements between iPhones and rival hardware (e.g., smartwatches, wireless earbuds), challenging the inclusion of the App Store under the DMA's regulatory scope\u2014arguing it is not a 'single platform service'\u2014and contesting the EU's investigation into iMessage, asserting it does not generate direct revenue and thus should not be classified as a 'gatekeeper platform.' The European Commission's representative, Paul-John Loewenthal, countered that Apple's 'absolute control' over the iPhone creates an unfair barrier to market entry, allowing it to extract excessive profits. The case is pivotal: a loss for Apple could set a precedent for other tech giants challenging DMA compliance. Other companies, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Booking Holdings, have also been forced to alter their operations under the DMA. Apple's appeal follows a \u20ac500 million (approx. $581 million) fine imposed by EU regulators, which the company is contesting separately. The EU has previously fined Google over \u20ac9.5 billion and ordered Apple to pay \u20ac13 billion in back taxes to Ireland. Apple maintains that the DMA disrupts the balance between innovation and security, and that forced openness may weaken user protection. The European Commission has not yet responded to Apple's arguments.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/6199708)\n\n**Apple Hits Back at EU Law in Court**\nApple has launched its broadest legal challenge yet against the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), arguing before the EU's General Court in Luxembourg that the law imposes 'hugely onerous and intrusive burdens' on designated gatekeepers, including Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, ByteDance, and Booking. The company contends the DMA violates EU protections for security, privacy, and property rights. Apple is contesting three key aspects: first, obligations requiring iPhone hardware and services to interoperate with competing devices, which it claims could undermine iOS security, violate intellectual property, and erode privacy safeguards; second, the designation of the App Store as a covered service under the DMA, which Apple disputes, arguing the App Store should not be treated as a single unified service and thus falls outside the law\u2019s scope; third, the European Commission\u2019s inquiry into whether iMessage should be subject to DMA obligations, which Apple claims was procedurally improper, even though the Commission ultimately decided not to impose full obligations due to iMessage\u2019s lack of direct revenue. The Commission\u2019s lawyer, Paul-John Loewenthal, countered that Apple maintains 'absolute control' over its 'walled garden,' extracting 'supernormal profits' and locking in over a third of European smartphone users. This case is the first time Apple has sought to limit the DMA\u2019s legal reach before full implementation, and a final ruling could determine whether the EU can compel Apple to unlock iPhone technical layers, restructure App Store rules, or subject iMessage to regulatory requirements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 12:08 PM\nSource:[MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/21/apple-hits-back-at-eu-law-in-court/)\n\n**Apple attacks EU crackdown in digital law's biggest court test - The Economic Times**\nApple Inc. launched a major legal challenge against the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU General Court, arguing that the law imposes 'hugely onerous and intrusive burdens' on its rights, particularly regarding interoperability mandates, App Store regulations, and a probe into iMessage. Apple's lawyer, Daniel Beard, claimed that the DMA threatens user privacy, security, and intellectual property rights, and challenged three key aspects: (1) obligations to ensure iPhone services work with rival hardware (e.g., earbuds, smartwatches); (2) the App Store\u2019s inclusion under the DMA, which led to a \u20ac500 million ($581 million) fine that Apple is contesting; and (3) the EU\u2019s attempt to investigate whether iMessage should be subject to DMA rules, despite not generating direct revenue. EU Commission lawyer Paul-John Loewenthal countered that Apple's 'absolute control' over its 'walled garden' ecosystem has enabled 'supernormal profits' and locked in over a third of European smartphone users. The case marks the most significant legal pushback against the DMA, following earlier setbacks for ByteDance over TikTok. Apple has previously faced \u20ac1.8 billion in antitrust penalties for app store practices and a \u20ac13 billion back-tax order from Ireland. Other tech giants\u2014including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Booking Holdings\u2014have also been affected by the DMA.

During a hearing at the General Court in Luxembourg, Apple's lawyer Daniel Bird argued that the DMA imposes 'burdensome obligations and unjustified interference' that violate Apple's rights within the EU's single market. The DMA, which came into effect in 2023, enforces strict rules limiting the power of tech giants by defining what they can and cannot do. The law has drawn criticism from former U.S. President Donald Trump and has strained trade talks between Brussels and Washington. Apple is challenging the DMA on three main grounds: (1) being forced to make its devices and services compatible with competitors' products like headphones and smartwatches, which Apple claims threatens user privacy, security, and intellectual property rights; (2) the inclusion of the App Store under the law, despite Apple's argument that it is a 'multi-service platform' not subject to the same legal definitions; and (3) the European Commission\u2019s attempt to investigate iMessage, which generates no direct revenue. The EU\u2019s legal representative, Paul Jon Loewenthal, countered that Apple maintains 'absolute control' over the iPhone ecosystem, granting it exceptional profits and blocking fair competition, stating, 'Only Apple holds the keys to this closed system, deciding who gets in and who is excluded.' The DMA also applies to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Booking.com, but Apple\u2019s case is considered the most significant and impactful, especially after TikTok (ByteDance) lost a prior appeal. In April 2025, the EU fined Apple \u20ac500 million for violating rules allowing developers to direct users to external payment methods, following a prior \u20ac1.8 billion fine related to music streaming apps. The case is seen as a pivotal moment that will shape the future relationship between the EU and Silicon Valley, as Brussels seeks greater control over companies it views as gatekeepers of the global digital economy.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 11:08 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/technology/in-focus/2025/10/21/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%82%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**Apple and Meta Near Breakthrough Deal with EU to Avoid Massive Fines**\nApple and Meta are on the verge of reaching a landmark agreement with the European Commission to resolve months-long regulatory disputes under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). According to reports by the Financial Times, Apple has agreed to modify App Store rules, including removing restrictions on steering users to external payment options and introducing a new fee structure: a 5% commission on purchases outside the App Store and a 'Core Technology Fee' for each annual app download exceeding one million installations. Meta is working on revising its advertising model to give users easier access to privacy-friendly ad options without requiring payment for an ad-free version. Although the deal has not yet been formally approved by Brussels, sources cited by FT indicate 'cautious optimism.' If finalized, the agreement could set a new benchmark for relations between 'big tech' firms and EU regulators. The Commission\u2019s more conciliatory stance may also reflect political considerations, as Donald Trump\u2014returning to the White House\u2014has previously criticized the EU for 'unfair treatment' of American companies, framing high fines and restrictions as economic protectionism. A successful deal could strengthen Brussels\u2019 negotiating position in future trade talks with the new U.S. administration. In April 2025, the European Commission imposed a \u20ac500 million fine on Apple for violating the 'steering' ban and a \u20ac200 million penalty on Meta for its 'consent or pay' model. Both companies appealed, arguing the Commission overstepped its authority and favored European and Chinese competitors. Meta called the penalties 'multibillion-euro tariffs' on American innovation. The DMA and Digital Services Act (DSA) are the two pillars of the EU\u2019s new digital regulatory framework. The DMA targets gatekeepers like Apple, Meta, Google, and Amazon by mandating fair competition, interoperability, and transparency\u2014requiring Apple to allow sideloading and Meta to offer real privacy choices. The DSA focuses on platform accountability for user-generated content, requiring rapid removal of illegal content, greater algorithmic transparency, and stronger consumer protection.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[nextgazetapl](https://next.gazeta.pl/next/7,151243,32312478,apple-i-meta-maja-dosc-gigantycznych-kar-przelomowe-porozumienie.html)\n\n**Report: Apple Nearing Agreement With EU Over App Store Rules**\nApple is reportedly nearing a settlement with the European Commission to resolve multiple antitrust investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aiming to avoid daily fines of up to 5% of its average global revenue. This follows a \u20ac500 million fine issued in April 2025 for violating the DMA\u2019s anti-steering provisions by restricting developers from directing users to external offers. The European Commission\u2019s investigation centers on Apple\u2019s App Store practices, particularly its control over payment systems and app distribution. In response, Apple introduced changes in June 2025, including allowing developers to promote alternative payment methods and distribute iOS apps through external marketplaces in the EU. However, ongoing talks focus on whether Apple\u2019s new developer contracts sufficiently remove barriers to fair competition, especially regarding developers\u2019 ability to communicate directly with users about external pricing without additional fees or restrictions. The DMA designates Apple as a 'gatekeeper' and mandates non-discrimination, fair access, and interoperability. Apple maintains it is already compliant and has appealed the initial ruling, arguing the Commission\u2019s interpretation exceeds the law\u2019s scope. The Commission continues gathering feedback from developers and stakeholders. Officials remain optimistic a resolution could be reached soon, with the outcome expected to significantly impact Apple\u2019s App Store operations in Europe.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 01:31 PM\nSource:[MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/08/apple-nearing-agreement-with-eu/)\n\n**Apple Urges EU to Abolish Digital Markets Act, Citing Innovation and User Safety Risks**\nApple has urged the European Commission to abolish the Digital Markets Act (DMA), arguing that the law fails to achieve its intended goals, harms European users, and stifles innovation within its technological ecosystem. The DMA, adopted by the European Union in 2022, aims to curb the dominance of major tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta, and promote competition with smaller firms. It grants the Commission broad powers to impose fines of up to 20% of global revenue for violations. Apple claims in its official consultation submission that the current DMA should be scrapped until a more suitable legislative tool is developed. The company argues that the law fails to balance competition protection with user safety, citing that its restrictions hinder innovation and delay the introduction of new technologies in Europe. Apple notes that compliance with DMA obligations has forced it to open certain system features to non-affiliated devices, causing delays in launching features such as real-time translation via AirPods and 'places visited' and 'preferred routes' in the Maps app\u2014features already available in other regions. The company also states that DMA mandates 'sideloading' (installing apps outside the official App Store) and allows alternative app markets and payment systems, which it claims increase user risks from fake apps, malware, and inadequate refund protections. This comes amid rising tensions, including a $587 million fine imposed by the EU in April 2025 for blocking developers from informing users about external offers. Apple called the fine 'unprecedented' and announced plans to appeal. Apple maintains that the DMA undermines the integrated user experience Apple users expect and delays access to new technologies, despite dedicating thousands of hours to compliance. The European Commission responded firmly, stating that compliance is a legal obligation, not optional. Analysts predict a prolonged legal battle, as Brussels insists the DMA protects competition and consumer rights, while Apple argues that the one-size-fits-all rules ignore differences in operating systems and may expose users to real risks.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0641\u062f](https://www.alwafd.news/5700142)\n\n**Europe's Digital Markets Act: Conflict and Confusion**\nThe European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), enacted three years ago, aims to regulate dominant tech 'gatekeepers'\u2014primarily American companies\u2014by requiring structural changes to promote competition. Under the DMA, Apple must reduce app store fees and allow third-party access to iOS; Google must stop favoring its own services in search; and Meta may need to offer a free, ad-free service. European regulators have already fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros and are preparing to penalize Google for noncompliance. The law has sparked transatlantic tensions: U.S. tech firms argue that DMA-mandated changes degrade product quality, compromise privacy and security, and delay European product launches. Apple delayed Live Translation and blocked iPhone Mirroring due to security concerns, while Google\u2019s inability to link directly to its Maps and travel sites has reportedly caused up to \u20ac114 billion in revenue losses, according to Alphabet\u2019s lawyer Oliver Bethell. Critics from both sides highlight enforcement gaps: competitors like Spotify claim Apple\u2019s compliance measures undermine the DMA\u2019s goal of consumer choice, while consumer groups such as BEUC call for faster enforcement. The European Commission is evaluating the DMA\u2019s effectiveness, with a recent consultation closing in September 2025. Despite calls from Apple and Google for repeal or reform, the Commission is likely to expand the law\u2019s scope to include cloud computing and AI services. Globally, the DMA has inspired similar laws in Japan, the UK, and other jurisdictions. Although the U.S. has not passed comparable legislation, federal antitrust actions against Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Google continue, with some cases seeking corporate breakup. The DMA enables faster regulatory action than traditional antitrust, but the required product changes are costly\u2014hundreds of thousands of engineering hours have been spent\u2014and often degrade user experience. The future remains uncertain: all three major tech firms are appealing fines and rulings to the European Court of Justice. Potential solutions include establishing an independent enforcement agency and expanding the DMA to cover AI and cloud services. The DMA continues to generate significant political, economic, and legal tension.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 07:51 PM\nSource:[CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/europes-digital-markets-act-conflict-and-confusion/)\n\n**EU Defends Digital Markets Act Against Apple Criticism**\nThe European Union rejected Apple\u2019s request to repeal the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law that entered force last year to curb abuses by dominant tech firms. Apple, which has opposed the DMA since its launch, argued that the regulation has degraded the services it offers and exposed users to new risks. In an official contribution to a Commission consultation, Apple said the DMA should be \"abrogated and replaced by a more suitable legislative text\" and proposed a separate regulatory agency to enforce the rules. The EU, however, categorically denied any intention to repeal the DMA. A Commission spokesperson, Thomas Regnier, said the EU was \"not surprised by Apple\u2019s lobbying arguments\" and that the company had \"continually contested every aspect of the DMA since its entry into force\". Apple also claimed the DMA forces it to restrict features on its products, citing the removal of the live\u2011translation function from the newly released AirPods Pro\u00a03 and the inability to open its devices to third\u2011party app stores or alternative payment systems. The company further alleged that the DMA has allowed pornographic apps to appear on iPhones, \"despite the risks they pose, especially to children\". The DMA, adopted in 2022 and effective from March\u00a02024, allows fines of up to 10\u202f% of a company\u2019s global turnover, rising to 20\u202f% for repeat violations. Apple has already paid a \u20ac500\u202fmillion fine in April for abusive clauses in its App Store, the first penalty imposed under the DMA.

It explains that the EU possesses the most powerful legal arsenal for digital regulation, having already imposed hefty fines on U.S. tech giants such as Meta and Apple. Brussels has refused to relax its two flagship laws \u2013 the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) \u2013 in trade negotiations with the United States.\n\nThe DSA aims to protect European users by imposing obligations on platforms, including:\n- establishing a reporting system for problematic content;\n- acting \"promptement\" to remove illicit content;\n- banning targeted advertising to minors.\nLarge platforms (X, TikTok, Meta, Apple, Google) face additional rules: they must assess risks related to illegal content, privacy, freedom of expression, health and public safety, and implement mitigation measures such as content moderation. They must also provide regulators and approved researchers with algorithmic access for compliance checks. Violations can lead to fines of up to 6\u202f% of annual turnover, and repeated serious breaches may result in a ban from operating in Europe.\n\nThe DMA seeks to end the dominant\u2011position abuse of tech giants (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) to protect startups and improve consumer choice. Key provisions include:\n- allowing users to uninstall pre\u2011installed services (browsers, maps, weather) and choose alternative app stores;\n- prohibiting cross\u2011platform data aggregation for targeted advertising without user consent.\nThe European Commission, with a team of about a hundred experts, holds enforcement power. Penalties can reach 10\u202f% of global turnover, and 20\u202f% for repeat offenders.\n\nThe article quotes the DSA\u2019s requirement for platforms to act \"promptement\" and highlights the EU\u2019s willingness to impose substantial fines, underscoring the tension between U.S. tech firms and European regulators.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Orange Actualit\u00e9s](https://actu.orange.fr/economie/les-puissantes-regles-de-l-ue-qui-encadrent-la-tech-et-agacent-trump-CNT000002klKeB.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasts converge on a very low probability that Apple will allow sideloading or other app stores on iPhones in the United States before January 1, 2026. Across regulatory, business strategy, legal, and technology policy perspectives, experts unanimously highlight that Apple has only enabled these features in the EU in response to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and has strictly geo-fenced such compliance to Europe. US-focused regulatory pressure (from the FTC, DOJ, or Congress) is present but slow-moving, and no imminent ruling, law, or settlement mandates Apple to alter its US app distribution model. Apple's enduring strategic incentives\u2014protecting platform control, revenue, brand, and perceived security\u2014reinforce resistance to change in the absence of legal compulsion. Spillover from EU policy is considered technically feasible but clearly demarcated from US operations by both technical and legal means. Ongoing antitrust litigation in the US is not expected to yield enforceable remedies within the next two months, and political factors (including protectionist attitudes) further diminish the likelihood of regulatory convergence. No credible media reports or signals suggest a forthcoming shift before the resolution window closes. The forecast probabilities range from 1% to 6%, with most clustered at 1-2%, reflecting overwhelming consensus on the status quo prevailing barring an extreme, unforeseen legal or regulatory shock.",
