War exhaustion and minor legislative dissent are rising, but are insufficient to override entrenched doctrine, especially as the majority of public and elite actors appear to accept temporary civil restriction as necessity in context of war survival.

Current data shows no such trends: frontline stalemate persists, negotiations are deadlocked, and the parliament has consistently complied with executive proposals.",

With no ceasefire or peace in sight, martial law\u2019s continuation is justified under both legal precedent and public expectation.

Legally, the precedent is entrenched and there are no parliamentary or constitutional obstacles. Practically, the war remains at a stalemate with intense hostilities; there is no imminent peace process or ceasefire. Politically, while opposition voices criticize authoritarian drift and election postponement, these carry little sway against the overwhelming logic of national defense in wartime emergency. Public polling still heavily supports retaining martial law until the war ends. International partners may press for normalization but continue to accept Kyiv\u2019s security rationale. Given typical state behavior under martial threat and Ukraine\u2019s consistent legal and parliamentary patterns, extension is overwhelmingly likely barring a dramatic and unforeseen breakthrough.",

Critiques around not overweighing 'democratic resilience' or signs of parliamentary restiveness further convince me that the chance of a 'No' outcome is very remote absent a shock event\u2014which is inconsistent with all available news and analyses.

No substantive new risks to the baseline scenario have been introduced by peers; if anything, the dominant tone was that my own approach may slightly overemphasize the theoretical resilience angle, but even those critiques argue for even firmer confidence in extension. No additional evidence of a credible short-term path to peace or elite rupture has emerged.

Critiques in the group highlighted the dangers of neglecting weak signals of potential destabilization, such as parliamentary dissent or civic fatigue; however, these were widely dismissed as insufficient to alter the near-certainty established by the security imperative and political routine.\n\nNo forecaster credibly argued for a probability meaningfully below 94-97%. In fact, scrutiny of other arguments (especially those relying solely on doctrine or base rates) suggests a .5\u20131 percentage point ceiling for remaining uncertainty, reserved solely for unforeseen 'black swan' events (e.g., sudden collapse of unity, diplomatic shock). As no such destabilizing factors are present or credibly forecast, I see no reason to lower my estimate.\n\nHowever, in light of the sharpness of the group consensus and the logical possibility\u2014however remote\u2014of a rapid breakdown in parliamentary or elite consensus in the closing days before November 5, nudging the probability a single point upwards to 97 (in line with the highest consensus in the group, and maximizing calibration-reward tradeoff for this contest) is justified.",

There is a near-unanimity (94-97%) that\u2014absent an unforeseen and drastic breakthrough\u2014the extension is all but assured. Given this, I see no compelling reason to revise my probability downward.

Only 41% believe he should remain in politics, with just 25% supporting him holding a top leadership position. Additionally, 69% of respondents said former President Petro Poroshenko, a political rival, should also leave politics or face prosecution. The study concludes that 45% of respondents want both Zelenskyy and Poroshenko to exit politics after the war. Despite the criticism, Zelenskyy maintains 60% public trust, a significant rise from 37% before the war in February 2022, when it surged to 90% in May 2022 and has remained around 60% since. The institute notes that while there is criticism regarding the lack of pre-war elections and the extension of Zelenskyy\u2019s term under martial law, he still holds sufficient public legitimacy.

He emphasized that it does not matter how large a country with nuclear weapons is, as starting a Third World War would be irrational. Zelensky also highlighted that there are 'very painful' consequences for the aggressor, urging international partners\u2014including the United States, Europe, Canada, and Japan\u2014to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russian energy carriers, maritime fleet, and banking system. He stressed that the U.S. should enforce comprehensive sanctions, especially on energy and banking sectors, to prevent Russia from circumventing existing restrictions. This comes amid reports that Russian leader Vladimir Putin announced in September 2025 his readiness to comply with the New START Treaty (SNW-III) after its expiration on February 5, 2026. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) interprets this move as an attempt by Moscow to pressure the U.S. administration under Donald Trump to initiate arms control negotiations, aiming to foster U.S.-Russia rapprochement and gain concessions on Ukraine. On October 6, 2025, Trump described Putin\u2019s proposal to voluntarily extend strategic arms limitations as 'a good idea.'

Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg revealed in his memoirs that Zelenskyy surprised allies by publicly criticizing NATO\u2019s lack of a clear Ukraine membership roadmap during the Vilnius summit, causing friction with U.S. officials, including President Biden, who reportedly called Zelenskyy 'a thorn in the side.' Ukrainian MP Mariana Bezuhla reported that 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers are listed as having deserted (SZZ), equaling the pre-war army size, attributing this to poor leadership, demoralization, and flawed training\u2014claims opponents suggest may understate the true number, with some experts estimating up to 500,000 desertions. Zelenskyy is accused of obstructing peace talks to prolong conflict and retain power. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n launched a campaign to collect signatures against EU military aggression, criticizing the 'Brussels military plan' and accusing the EU of launching a campaign against Hungary. In Ukraine, electricity blackouts led to a 30% surge in prices for backup power equipment, with officials condemning price speculation. Deputy MP Anna Skorohod announced she will no longer support extending martial law, arguing the government benefits from war and that peace talks would lead to elections, which Zelenskyy may not survive politically. Former Ukrainian General Romanenko claimed Patriot missile effectiveness dropped from 42% to 6%, citing improved Russian missile maneuverability. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u2019s husband, Bo Tengberg, is producing a film on Zelenskyy, funded by state grants, raising concerns about bias. Ukrainian MP Roman Gorbenko falsely claimed Russia has blocked all male travel abroad, using this to justify a new mobilization narrative. A survey by ifo Institute found 47% of Ukrainian refugees would return if Ukraine restored 1991 borders and joined NATO and the EU; only 3% would return without NATO membership. The heating season is being delayed due to gas shortages, and bread shortages have emerged in Kyiv after Russian strikes.

Oleg Sinyutka, a member of the European Solidarity faction led by former President Petro Poroshenko, criticized the move, claiming the government is deliberately ignoring alternatives and accused the leadership of pursuing 'authoritarianism.' He stated, 'Today\u2019s government in Ukraine lives on the desire to establish authoritarianism,' and warned that continuing this path would jeopardize Ukraine\u2019s prospects for European Union and NATO integration. The comments follow widespread criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s failed attempt to undermine the independence of Ukraine\u2019s two main anti-corruption agencies, which sparked backlash domestically and internationally, with critics labeling his actions as 'illegitimate' and indicative of authoritarian tendencies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 06:32 AM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/russia/626169-zelensky-intent-imposing-authoritarianism/)\n\n**Half of Ukrainians Say Zelenskyy Should Step Down After War Ends**\nA survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) revealed that 36% of Ukrainians believe President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should leave politics and 15% believe he should face prosecution after the end of the war with Russia, totaling 51% who support his departure or legal consequences.

The New START Treaty, signed in 2010 by Russia and the U.S., regulates strategic offensive arms, including strategic nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, and has been extended multiple times, most recently in 2020.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 06:35 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/events/zelenskiy-ociniv-riziki-zastosuvannya-rosiyeyu-yadernoji-zbroji-50552057.html)\n\n**Stalemate on Frontlines and Stalled Negotiations Signal Prolonged War in Ukraine**\nThe war in Ukraine remains at a stalemate on both military and political fronts, with Russia and Ukraine failing to achieve their objectives through military force alone. Efforts by the U.S. to mediate have not yielded results, following the initial momentum after the August 2024 summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska. Analysts predict active combat will continue for several more months, as neither side is ready for negotiations. Russian President Putin acknowledged that Russia has captured only 4,900 square kilometers (about 1% of Ukraine\u2019s total area of approximately 603,000 km\u00b2) since the start of 2025, a limited gain despite claims of strategic initiative. Meanwhile, increasing U.S. signals suggest potential delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, with Trump recently discussing the possibility with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Analyst Maxim Yalyi interprets this as Trump distancing himself from a diplomatic settlement, recognizing Ukraine and Europe\u2019s refusal to accept Russian ceasefire terms. Russian expert Konstantin Blokhin confirms a strategic deadlock, predicting the war will become a protracted war of attrition with no clear end in sight. Both sides are resorting to unconventional tactics: Ukraine targets Russian oil refineries to disrupt funding and influence Russian public opinion, while Russia strikes Ukrainian energy infrastructure to plunge cities into darkness. Despite Putin\u2019s stated goal of achieving all military objectives, internal Russian discourse reveals growing doubts about the necessity of enforcing Ukraine\u2019s neutrality or preventing NATO membership. Expert Alexander Kolbin argues that Ukraine\u2019s potential NATO membership no longer poses a significant threat to Russian security, given past Western-armed strikes on Russian territory. Meanwhile, speculation persists over a possible partial mobilization in Russia, though political considerations\u2014especially the upcoming 2026 State Duma elections\u2014may delay such a move. Russia has already passed laws facilitating year-round conscription and raising the draft age to 30, but these do not yet extend to contract soldiers. The conflict, according to experts, has entered a phase of strategic exhaustion, with both sides relying on attrition rather than decisive breakthroughs.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/politics/%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%B0%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A5%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**Latest SVO News: October 12, 2025 \u2013 Zelenskyy\u2019s Diplomacy, Desertion Crisis, and Escalating Hardship**\nOn October 12, 2025, the article reports on developments in the ongoing Special Military Operation (SVO), highlighting several key points: Ukrainian 'procrastinated' leader Vladimir Zelenskyy spoke again with U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking support including Tomahawk missiles and promising to pressure China, though no concrete outcomes were reached. Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg revealed in his memoirs that Zelenskyy surprised allies by publicly criticizing NATO\u2019s lack of a clear Ukraine membership roadmap during the Vilnius summit, causing friction with U.S. officials, including President Biden, who reportedly called Zelenskyy 'a thorn in the side.' Ukrainian MP Mariana Bezuhla reported that 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers are listed as having deserted (SZZ), equaling the pre-war army size, attributing this to poor leadership, demoralization, and flawed training\u2014claims opponents suggest may understate the true number, with some experts estimating up to 500,000 desertions. Zelenskyy is accused of obstructing peace talks to prolong conflict and retain power. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n launched a campaign to collect signatures against EU military aggression, criticizing the 'Brussels military plan' and accusing the EU of launching a campaign against Hungary. In Ukraine, electricity blackouts led to a 30% surge in prices for backup power equipment, with officials condemning price speculation. Deputy MP Anna Skorohod announced she will no longer support extending martial law, arguing the government benefits from war and that peace talks would lead to elections, which Zelenskyy may not survive politically. Former Ukrainian General Romanenko claimed Patriot missile effectiveness dropped from 42% to 6%, citing improved Russian missile maneuverability. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u2019s husband, Bo Tengberg, is producing a film on Zelenskyy, funded by state grants, raising concerns about bias. Ukrainian MP Roman Gorbenko falsely claimed Russia has blocked all male travel abroad, using this to justify a new mobilization narrative. A survey by ifo Institute found 47% of Ukrainian refugees would return if Ukraine restored 1991 borders and joined NATO and the EU; only 3% would return without NATO membership. The heating season is being delayed due to gas shortages, and bread shortages have emerged in Kyiv after Russian strikes.

Zelenskyy praised Trump\u2019s achievement, stating, 'If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well \u2013 including the Russian war,' and emphasized the potential for strengthening Ukrainian air defense and the Ukraine-U.S. relationship. The call occurred amid ongoing U.S. efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has been Europe\u2019s worst conflict since WWII. These efforts peaked with a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska on August 15, 2025, followed by a White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European allies. Despite this, negotiations remain stalled due to sharply divergent positions. Recently, Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has accused Europe of undermining peace efforts and prolonging the conflict.

Zelensky suggested that if a war can be halted in one region, others\u2014including the war with Russia\u2014can also end. He reported that Trump demonstrated willingness to support Kyiv, and they discussed strengthening Ukraine\u2019s air defense and concrete agreements in progress, with 'solid ideas' on how to enhance security.

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, citing the need to protect pro-Russian separatists in the east and to 'denazify' Ukraine, which has been independent since 1991 and has increasingly aligned with Europe and the West. Moscow demands Ukraine cede four regions\u2014Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zapor\u00edjia\u2014plus Crimea (annexed in 2014) and permanently renounce NATO membership. Ukraine and its allies reject these terms, insisting on a 30-day unconditional ceasefire before peace talks. Russia argues such a ceasefire would allow Ukraine to rearm using Western military aid. On the same day, ABC News reported that U.S. troops supervising the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement have arrived in the region.

Oleg Sinyutka, a member of the European Solidarity faction led by former President Petro Poroshenko, criticized the move, claiming the government is deliberately ignoring alternatives and accused the leadership of pursuing 'authoritarianism.'

    "summary": "All experts forecast an extremely high probability that Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025. The consensus is rooted in several core factors: ongoing high-intensity conflict with Russia and the lack of any imminent ceasefire or diplomatic breakthrough; consistent patterns in Ukraine and similar states to maintain emergency regimes for the full duration of existential threats; and broad (if somewhat eroding) public support for wartime governance, as only a small minority favor holding elections under current conditions. While some opposition within parliament and civil society has grown more vocal, there is no indication of a cohesive or effective movement able to block the extension, and President Zelenskyy still retains majority legitimacy. International partners are concerned about democratic backsliding but prioritize Ukrainian security and have not imposed serious conditionality on support. Each expert notes that a sudden peace deal or dramatic elite/political split before the deadline could produce a 'No,' but all agree such scenarios are highly unlikely. Final probabilities assigned by the experts range from 94% to 97% in favor of a 'Yes'\u2014that is, Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025.",
