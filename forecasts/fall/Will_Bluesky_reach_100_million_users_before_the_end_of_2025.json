Bluesky\u2019s moderation and ideological challenges could hinder mainstream crossover.

In product-market-fit terms, Bluesky still appeals most to a subset of ex-Twitter/X users, journalists, scientists, and progressives, not the mass market. Outreach campaigns and modest product upgrades do not seem to have triggered new inflection points. Competition from Threads (Meta), which is filling the generalist text-social gap, further shrinks Bluesky\u2019s expansion ceiling. However, since the resolution depends on registered, not active, users, an event or marketing push could pad the numbers, but the required jump (from 38M to 100M, nearly tripling in ~3 months) is highly nontrivial. The historic base rate for social networks rarely shows consecutive exponential surges after the initial hype unless there is a consistent, recurring external catalyst or definitive PMF for a broad audience.

Instead, evidence points towards stabilization, fragmentation, and a bounded appeal within identity-based and technical subgroups. The platform's current moderate growth rate, rising churn/disillusionment, and increased moderation strictness compromise the likelihood of tripling the user base in the short time remaining, especially as larger platforms consolidate and integrate their defectors. The base rate for a new social network tripling its size in less than four months, after the initial network externality-driven surge has ended, is extremely low. Given all the above, and factoring in the absence of meaningful new 'flight' from X or game-changing PR events, the probability of Bluesky reaching 100 million users by year-end is much lower than the initial 92% estimate.

It underscores that even after strong initial growth, a platform\u2019s long-term trajectory is heavily influenced by early decisions, entrenchment, and the pre-existence of established competitors with robust network effects. The probability estimate is appropriately low, factoring in that Bluesky faces not only the technical and moderation scaling issues typical of the plateau phase, but also user inertia, incumbent lock-in, and the diminishing returns of protest-driven migration. The forecast also reasons well by referencing base rates and the extreme unlikelihood of sustaining or re-igniting exponential growth without a fresh, major external shock\u2014especially in a now-stabilized environment. Overall, the path dependence framework is an excellent lens for analyzing this problem, and the conclusion is firmly grounded in both empirical and theoretical precedents."

The 'Trough of Disillusionment' phase closely mirrors empirical patterns where platforms lose momentum after a burst, and user additions become much more expensive and difficult. The base-rate emphasis\u2014from a technology adoption perspective\u2014rightly points out that very few social platforms, especially without the lever of integration into a larger ecosystem, achieve a second exponential surge on the timeline required here. The probabilistic estimate (8%) matches both historic performance for challenger platforms and the inertial power of incumbents like Threads and X. Moreover, the analysis explicitly keeps open a slim tail-risk channel for black swans, aligning with best forecasting practices. In summary, this argument avoids both hype and fatalism, synthesizing technology diffusion theory and practical realities, and is both methodologically rigorous and empirically justified from a network effects perspective."

The analyst's emphasis on the base-rate advantage of Meta-backed platforms and on the lack of evidence for a fresh external shock is highly appropriate. Importantly, their reasoning recognizes that two-sided network effects can fizzle when neither content creators nor mainstream users see disproportionate new value\u2014the engine stalls without new cross-side catalysts. This matches what we see in Bluesky's trajectory: strong initial migration, followed by a plateau. The well-calibrated probability (8%) reflects a realistic estimate of tail risk without hyperbole.

The analyst accurately notes that network effects are not self-perpetuating; past a certain threshold, growth depends on either unique new value or disruption at incumbents\u2014neither of which is present for Bluesky. The very low probability assigned (7%) is justified, as the gap to 100M in 3 months cannot be bridged by normal network dynamics or superficial 'buzz.' Their attention to user churn, appeal fragmentation, and the relatively bounded sociological appeal (identity and technical subgroups rather than mass-market) directly addresses the core path dependence issue as well. The only slight augment I would add is the risk of competitor errors being near zero\u2014historically, even major platform blunders rarely generate another full wave of user flight so soon.

Communication Studies and U&G research emphasize that, after an initial surge, user migration is heavily influenced by the ability to fulfill *new* or *unmet* social and identity gratifications at scale\u2014a capability Bluesky has yet to demonstrate outside its core cohort. There is little evidence for another viral, broadly motivating 'push factor,' especially as X and Threads stabilize and as gratification deficits are filled elsewhere. Registration padding or marketing pushes might yield modest bumps but won't sustain the user retention Bluesky needs for this growth. The forecast would be more compelling if it explicitly addressed these deeper motivational dynamics and better contextualized the extreme rarity of consecutive viral surges absent disruptive new gratifications. Given platform inertia, competition, and the lack of widespread, unresolved user needs, a probability closer to the single digits is more defensible."

The company first reported 20\u202fbillion MAU in October\u202f2022, and within less than three years hit the new benchmark. Zuckerberg also noted that Facebook\u2019s MAU exceeded 30\u202fbillion in January and WhatsApp\u2019s MAU surpassed 30\u202fbillion in April. Meta acquired Instagram in 2012 for US$1\u202fbillion, a move that was initially questioned because Instagram was then a low\u2011profit photo\u2011sharing platform. Since then, Instagram has grown into a diversified social\u2011media ecosystem, serving as a key platform for e\u2011commerce, advertising, and content creation. Analysts project that by 2025 Instagram will contribute more than half of Meta\u2019s U.S. advertising revenue. Instagram launched the short\u2011video feature Reels in 2020 to compete with TikTok and YouTube Shorts, boosting user engagement. The most followed individual on Instagram is football star Cristiano Ronaldo, with 6.6\u202fbillion followers, followed by Lionel Messi with 5\u202fbillion. Meta\u2019s July\u202f2025 earnings report highlighted stronger-than\u2011expected results, attributing growth to AI\u2011driven advertising efficiencies. The Meta family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.) reported a cumulative 34.8\u202fbillion daily active users, an 11\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year increase in ad impressions, and a 9\u202f% rise in average ad price.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://technews.tw/2025/09/25/instagram-surpasses-3-billion-monthly-active-users/)\n\n**Instagram Reaches 3\u202fBillion Monthly Active Users**\nMeta\u2019s Instagram platform has surpassed 3\u202fbillion monthly active users, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram head Adam\u202fMosseri, as announced on September\u202f24\u202f2025. This milestone matches other Meta networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp, which already had 3\u202fbillion users. The last time Instagram reported user numbers was in 2022, when it reached 2\u202fbillion. In April\u202f2024 Meta announced it would stop publishing monthly or daily user metrics, instead releasing quarterly figures to investors. Mosseri thanked users and said the platform will continue to focus on three core pillars: Reels, DMs, and recommendations. He added, 'Se voc\u00ea olhar para os \u00faltimos anos, quase todo o nosso crescimento foi impulsionado por DMs, Reels e recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es [...] Por isso, continuaremos a focar nesses produtos e reorientar o aplicativo mais para DMs, Reels e recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es nos pr\u00f3ximos meses.'

The platform uses the open\u2011source AT Protocol, offers a Twitter\u2011like interface, and is free. It has introduced features such as custom feeds, a Starter Pack, and a video tab. Bluesky has attracted high\u2011profile users including Alexandria Ocasio\u2011Cortez, Mark Cuban, and former U.S. presidents. The company has raised $15\u202fmillion in Series\u202fA and is developing a subscription service, Bluesky+, while maintaining a policy of not selling user data. It has faced moderation controversies, including a 17\u2011fold rise in reports in 2024, and has expanded its moderation team to about 100 moderators. The platform emphasizes decentralization, allowing users to port accounts to other AT\u2011Protocol apps.

The update is part of a broader review that began in January 2025. After the initial release, the platform collected feedback from more than 14,000 users, who offered suggestions on how the rules could affect creative expression and 'traditionally marginalized voices'. In a statement, Bluesky said, 'After considering this feedback, and returning to our experimental roots, we will focus on encouraging constructive dialogue and applying our rules against harassment and toxic content. To start, we will intensify our enforcement efforts.' A spokesperson told TechCrunch that from now on, users who break the rules will receive fewer warnings before their accounts are deactivated. The changes also clarify the permissions tied to the four core principles\u2014Safety First, Respect for Others, Authenticity, and Rule Compliance\u2014and provide clearer definitions to reduce vague terms.

Instagram\u2019s active users grew from 1\u202fbillion in 2018 to over 2\u202fbillion in October\u202f2022, according to Zuckerberg\u2019s earlier statements. The rapid growth was driven by features such as Reels launched in 2020, which compete with TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

The company first reported 20\u202fbillion MAU in October\u202f2022, and within less than three years hit the new benchmark. Zuckerberg also noted that Facebook\u2019s MAU exceeded 30\u202fbillion in January and WhatsApp\u2019s MAU surpassed 30\u202fbillion in April. Meta acquired Instagram in 2012 for US$1\u202fbillion, a move that was initially questioned because Instagram was then a low\u2011profit photo\u2011sharing platform. Since then, Instagram has grown into a diversified social\u2011media ecosystem, serving as a key platform for e\u2011commerce, advertising, and content creation. Analysts project that by 2025 Instagram will contribute more than half of Meta\u2019s U.S. advertising revenue. Instagram launched the short\u2011video feature Reels in 2020 to compete with TikTok and YouTube Shorts, boosting user engagement. The most followed individual on Instagram is football star Cristiano Ronaldo, with 6.6\u202fbillion followers, followed by Lionel Messi with 5\u202fbillion. Meta\u2019s July\u202f2025 earnings report highlighted stronger-than\u2011expected results, attributing growth to AI\u2011driven advertising efficiencies.

The most followed account on Instagram is Cristiano Ronaldo with 660\u202fmillion followers, followed by Lionel Messi with 500\u202fmillion. Meta\u2019s Q4 earnings beat expectations, with the company citing AI\u2011driven improvements to its ad system as a major revenue driver. The Meta family\u2014Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp\u2014has a combined daily active user base of 3.48\u202fbillion, with ad impressions up 11\u202f% and average ad price up 9\u202f% year\u2011over\u2011year.

The last time Instagram reported user numbers was in 2022, when it reached 2\u202fbillion. In April\u202f2024 Meta announced it would stop publishing monthly or daily user metrics, instead releasing quarterly figures to investors.

The platform uses the open\u2011source AT Protocol, offers a Twitter\u2011like interface, and is free. It has introduced features such as custom feeds, a Starter Pack, and a video tab. Bluesky has attracted high\u2011profile users including Alexandria Ocasio\u2011Cortez, Mark Cuban, and former U.S. presidents. The company has raised $15\u202fmillion in Series\u202fA and is developing a subscription service, Bluesky+, while maintaining a policy of not selling user data. It has faced moderation controversies, including a 17\u2011fold rise in reports in 2024, and has expanded its moderation team to about 100 moderators. The platform emphasizes decentralization, allowing users to port accounts to other AT\u2011Protocol apps.

The update is part of a broader review that began in January 2025. After the initial release, the platform collected feedback from more than 14,000 users, who offered suggestions on how the rules could affect creative expression and 'traditionally marginalized voices'. In a statement, Bluesky said, 'After considering this feedback, and returning to our experimental roots, we will focus on encouraging constructive dialogue and applying our rules against harassment and toxic content. To start, we will intensify our enforcement efforts.' A spokesperson told TechCrunch that from now on, users who break the rules will receive fewer warnings before their accounts are deactivated. The changes also clarify the permissions tied to the four core principles\u2014Safety First, Respect for Others, Authenticity, and Rule Compliance\u2014and provide clearer definitions to reduce vague terms. A new section dedicated to journalism, education, law, and mental\u2011health content was added to reduce uncertainty about how the guidelines apply in those areas.

The quarter\u2011on\u2011quarter drop signals a slowdown in momentum that began earlier in the year, following a surge in advertiser interest during Q1\u202f2025 after the 2024 U.S. election. The renewed enthusiasm was not sustained, with the Q2 intake suggesting a struggle to retain ad spending. This was compounded by Elon Musk\u2019s public fallout with then\u2011President Donald Trump and his subsequent announcement to \u2018swear off politics,\u2019 which dissipated some of the initial momentum. Part of X\u2019s strategy to reduce its dependency on advertising has been to pivot toward subscription services and other non\u2011ad revenue streams, but these efforts have not scaled quickly enough to offset the slipping ad sales. While X Premium is bringing in some revenue, it is not at the level needed to fill the financial gap. Other initiatives, such as the \u2018X Money\u2019 payments feature, have been held up by regulatory approvals, further delaying diversification efforts. With an estimated $2.9\u202fbillion in total revenue projected for 2025 and about $1.2\u202fbillion in annual debt servicing costs, X is under intense pressure to perform. The company\u2019s recent merger with xAI, which is reportedly burning through $1\u202fbillion per month on infrastructure, adds another layer of financial risk. Meanwhile, Meta\u2019s Threads continues to grow, posing a significant threat to X\u2019s mobile app user base and potentially siphoning away ad dollars. For X to navigate its financial challenges, regaining advertiser confidence will be crucial, likely depending on maintaining policy consistency and ensuring user growth in the face of stiff competition. The performance of its non\u2011ad revenue streams will be under scrutiny, as their success is vital for the platform\u2019s long\u2011term sustainability. The outcome of X\u2019s AI ambitions, particularly its integration with xAI, will also play a significant role in its future trajectory. Ultimately, the platform\u2019s ability to balance its transition toward an AI\u2011centric model with the demands of a volatile ad market will determine its success in the coming years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 09:21 AM\nSource:[TechJuice](https://www.techjuice.pk/x-reports-a-sharp-dip-in-q2-ad-revenue-despite-earlier-momentum/)\n\n**Who&#x2019;s Next? Bluesky Posters Call for Deaths of Prominent Republicans, Conservative Media Figures**\nFollowing the murder of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, users on the Bluesky app have posted calls for the deaths of several high\u2011profile right\u2011wing figures, including Elon Musk, Donald Trump, J.K. Rowling, Ben Shapiro, Matt\u202fWalsh and Michael\u202fKnowles. Screenshots show threats ranging from violent language to explicit suggestions of who should be targeted next. BlueSky, which has about 1.5\u202fmillion daily users, issued warnings on Thursday that such posts violated its community guidelines, which prohibit 'encouragement of violence against individuals, groups, institutions or the general public' and 'wishes of harm directed at a specific person or group.' The platform, founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has become a sanctuary for progressives after Musk's overhaul of Twitter as X and Trump's 2024 victory. Other right\u2011wing influencers\u2014Chaya Raichik, Andy Ngo, Christopher Rufo and Benny Johnson\u2014have also been targeted. Earlier this summer, far\u2011left extremists on BlueSky had posted threats against federal officers and sought personal information about their families. The New\u202fYork\u202fPost confirmed that some of the violent posts were removed by Thursday evening. In response, other platforms such as Meta, YouTube, Discord and Reddit have flagged graphic content and removed posts celebrating Kirk's death or restricted them from younger users.

In a post on its Safety account, Bluesky said, 'Glorifying violence or harm violates Bluesky's Community Guidelines. We review reports and take action on content that celebrates harm against anyone.' It added, 'Violence has no place in healthy public discourse, and we're committed to fostering healthy, open conversations.' The platform stated that any user who violates this policy could have their account suspended or removed. Other platforms\u2014Meta, YouTube, Reddit, Discord\u2014also condemned posts about the shooting, and MSNBC fired a political analyst for remarks made after the incident. Bluesky was founded as a side project of Twitter in 2019, became independent in 2021, and launched publicly in 2023 after Elon\u202fMusk bought Twitter for $44\u202fbillion in late 2022.

The analysis covered more than 2.6\u202fmillion Bluesky posts that reference scholarly content between January\u202f2023 and July\u202f2025. In October\u202f2024 there were roughly 10\u202f000 posts, 3\u202f200 users and 6\u202f500 referenced articles; by November those numbers jumped to 239\u202f000 posts, 35\u202f000 users and 54\u202f000 articles, peaking in January\u202f2025 at 324\u202f000 posts by 45\u202f000 users referencing 71\u202f000 unique articles. Activity has since stabilized with a slight decline. \"The stabilization of posts, users and referenced articles suggests that Bluesky has already established itself as a credible and lasting platform for science communication, rather than a short\u2011lived trend,\" said Er\u2011Te Zheng, a Ph.D. student at Sheffield, via email. The study also found that 48\u202f% of scholarly posts received at least 10 likes and 34\u202f% were reposted at least 10 times, compared with only 3.9\u202f%\u20117.5\u202f% of X posts receiving more than 10 likes and 1.4\u202f%\u20114.4\u202f% receiving 10 reposts or more.

Bluesky, with more than 38\u202fmillion users, remains far smaller than X, which Elon Musk claimed had about 600\u202fmillion monthly active users as of May\u202f2024. Nonetheless, a January poll by Nature found that more than half of 5\u202f300 respondents \u2013 most scientists \u2013 had left X, citing dissatisfaction with Musk\u2019s leadership and relaxed content moderation. \"This suggests that Bluesky users participate more actively and with greater originality in interactions around scholarly articles,\" Zheng added.

Wang highlighted that Bluesky offers higher engagement rates than larger platforms and positions itself as a democratic space that prohibits hate speech, harassment and misinformation: 'L'application est une comme une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique.'

Bluesky added a feature to combat identity theft and maintained its popularity, reaching over 30 million users, with 18-24 year olds being the most active users, according to Statista. To attract more users, Bluesky has released a new update with 'Activity Notifications' that allows users to control which notifications they receive. This feature enables users to activate a bell icon on a user's profile, receiving only new post and response notifications. Additionally, the update has expanded granular controls to decide which notifications to receive, such as likes, new followers, or other activities, and from whom. The simplified 'priority notifications' option has been integrated into the new configuration, and Bluesky will now notify users if someone likes or re-posts their content, according to The Verge.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 08, 2025 11:35 AM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/aplicaciones/bluesky-adios-notificaciones-molestas-nueva-actualizacion-5729338/)\n\n**Threads Closes Gap with X in Daily Active Users, Bluesky Grows Rapidly**\nInstagram Threads is closing the gap with X (formerly Twitter) in terms of daily active users, according to Similarweb data. In June 2025, Threads had 115.1 million daily active users, up 127.8% from the same period last year. X had 132 million daily active users, but this is a 15.2% decrease from the same period last year. Decentralized social network Bluesky is also growing rapidly, with a 372.5% increase in daily active users over the past year, but its audience is still relatively small, with 4.1 million daily active users. Bluesky's growth was fueled by users leaving X in protest of Elon Musk's association with Donald Trump, but the platform has since become criticized for being one-sidedly liberal, leading some users to return to Threads. Despite its potential, the competition is currently between Threads and X, with Threads being the main competitor to X for advertising budgets on mobile devices. However, on desktop, X has a significant advantage, with 145.8 million daily visits in June 2025, compared to Threads' 6.9 million. Bluesky is also growing in this segment, with 5.3 million daily visits. In the US, the situation is mixed, with Threads closing the gap with X on mobile devices, but X dominating on desktop. 'It's not just about the protest traffic, but about the interest in the technological approach: an open, customizable social network,' said analysts. 'Those who come only because it's 'not X' may quickly leave if the platform doesn't meet their expectations. Instead, the technical community may stay and support the development of the ecosystem.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 08, 2025 06:39 AM\nSource:[ITC.ua](https://itc.ua/news/threads-dogonyaet-x-na-smartfonah-audytoryy-pochty-sravnyalys/)\n\n**Threads Closes Gap with X in Mobile Users, But Still Trails on Web**\nMark Zuckerberg's social media platform, Threads, has reached 1.151 billion daily active users (DAU) on mobile, just 15 million short of Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). This is a significant increase from last year, with Threads' DAU growing by 127.8% and X's DAU decreasing by 15.2%. In the US, Threads has 153 million daily mobile users, just behind X's 229 million. The gap between the two platforms has narrowed since Musk's close relationship with Donald Trump sparked a mass exodus of users from X. Threads is a text-based social media platform launched by Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in response to X. While X still dominates on the web, with 145.8 million daily web visitors, Threads has 6.9 million, a 20-fold difference. However, Threads has 3.5 billion global monthly active users (MAU), compared to X's 6 billion, according to Musk's claim last year. Another decentralized network, Bluesky, has gained attention as a potential alternative to X, with 410 million global mobile app users and 240 million in the US, significantly ahead of Threads.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: July 07, 2025 10:57 PM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025070837007)\n\n",

    "summary": "The panel of experts across multiple disciplines\u2014technology market analysis, product management, sociology, economics, and communication studies\u2014are broadly aligned in their assessments that Bluesky is highly unlikely to reach 100 million users by the end of 2025. Experts observed Bluesky's rapid growth after the 2024 U.S. election and policy changes at X (Twitter), quickly accelerating to 38 million users in September 2025. However, all perspectives converged on the point that this surge has plateaued or slowed, with no evidence of a new viral growth wave underway.\n\nKey constraining factors cited include the historical base rate: almost no independent social platform has managed to triple its user base from 30-40 million to 100 million in under four months absent vast corporate resources, pre-existing networks, or an ongoing massive migration due to external shocks. Meta\u2019s Threads, benefiting from substantial resources and integration with Instagram, now dominates competitive migration, capturing most defectors looking for X alternatives. Moreover, recent moderation controversies and perceptions of ideological bias at Bluesky are noted to be limiting its broad mainstream uptake.\n\nSeveral experts did identify tail risks: should a black swan event occur\u2014such as a catastrophic scandal, outage, or high-profile migration from a competitor\u2014the user count could potentially surge. However, the consensus is that such scenarios are unpredictable and not substantiated by current trends. Most forecasts place Bluesky\u2019s end-2025 user base in the 40-60 million range, well short of the target.\n\nForecast probabilities for Bluesky reaching 100 million users by year-end cluster between 7% and 25%, with most experts selecting 8-15%, and only the product management expert assigning a higher but still low 25% reflecting the possibility that registered (not active) user counts could be rapidly boosted by a last-minute growth hack or viral campaign rather than true engagement. Overall, the expert consensus strongly favors a No outcome barring an extraordinary disruptive event in the social networking landscape.",
