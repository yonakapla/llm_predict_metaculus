The anti-Prop 50 coalition includes effective messenger Schwarzenegger and a well-funded campaign, which historically matters more for defeating than passing ballot measures. However, the national stakes could boost Democratic turnout. Turnout is the true wild card. My expertise in past California ballot fights and understanding of how undecideds behave leads me to believe the current polling overstates Yes support, but not enough to make a No outcome nearly certain. Nationalization and Newsom\u2019s messaging may shave the typical attrition for Yes measures somewhat.

Current polling shows a tenuous pro-yes margin with many undecideds and only a slim lead over a presumed turnout model. The relatively high number of voters who have not heard about the measure (low salience), the tendency for cost, complexity, and 'good government' opposition to sway undecideds to 'no,' and extensive, high-profile, bipartisan-funded campaigns against the measure are all powerful headwinds. On the other hand, an unprecedented mobilization from Democrats and a 'rally the base' effect could counteract the drop-off if national polarization trumps local process concerns. From a demographic weighting perspective, the main uncertainty lies in exactly how much marginal turnout among younger, minority, and low-propensity urban voters the Yes campaign can generate versus whether older, frequent, and disengaged voters drift toward 'no' on a confusing, expensive special election. Overall, while the initial headline polling (51-34, 48-32 support) is encouraging for proponents, it is below the 58-60% historically needed at this point for safe passage of controversial statewide measures. Factoring in likely ballot measure fade, negative elite cues, and status-quo inertia, combined with a base rate for similarly complex and partisan ballot measures in California, the odds currently stand in the 'slight favorite to pass' range, but not overwhelming.

The opposition is wealthy, credible, and bipartisan\u2014a significant X factor\u2014but the Democratic base is numerically dominant and potentially highly energized if the campaign stays focused on the referendum-as-national-defense frame. On balance, I expect the measure to pass, but by a margin narrower than the current polling leads suggest.

Additionally, a single-ballot, existentially framed special election will likely see the modal voter more informed and politically motivated than the generic low-salience election\u2014a factor that can swing outcomes closer to the underlying partisan composition if elite cues are lined up.

Recent California election cycles also indicate that party cues and the salience of opposition to Trump can disrupt the classic base-rate of late No swings, especially when turnout is energized by outside-the-normal-cycle national issues. Furthermore, resource asymmetry between Yes and No is less than in prior defeated reforms, lessening the risk that a barrage of last-minute negative messaging entirely dominates.

That\u2019s consistent with research in policy feedback that shows dramatic exogenous shocks can yield feedback loops that disrupt even entrenched institutional arrangements."

However, this estimate appears to underweight the extent to which heightened polarization, identity-based mobilization, and the social movement-style campaign infrastructure deployed by Democrats can reframe the collective action calculus. In the current context, the explicit framing of Prop 50 as a response to outside aggression (Texas/Trump), the presence of national-level campaign resources, and the emotional salience attached to 'defending democracy' have the potential to reduce classic asymmetries in turnout and participatory costs that usually constrain pro-reform coalitions. Additionally, by drawing on strong in-group collective identities, the Yes campaign may mobilize not just usual high-propensity voters but also lower-propensity partisans who typically abstain in low-salience contests. These factors can lead to a higher probability of passage than prior process-focused initiatives would predict, especially when the status-quo is successfully reframed as an imposition of partisan disadvantage. Thus, weighting the extraordinary mobilization and framing factors more heavily suggests the base passage probability should be somewhat higher."

Numerous procedural rollbacks with ample polling leads and national partisan stakes have failed when undecideds break sharply No, especially when bipartisan, trusted figures urge caution. Furthermore, 'surge' turnout is notoriously difficult to convert for complex, process-oriented measures\u2014especially in a single-issue, off-cycle election where habitual participants (older, more status quo-oriented) make up a larger share of the electorate. This means the forecast's 57% likelihood for passage may be too optimistic, insufficiently penalizing for the status quo bias and underestimating the effect of broad-based, well-funded, institutionalist opposition. A more balanced estimate would discount further for dominant patterns of late-campaign falloff and consider structural obstacles to shifting the real composition of the special election electorate."

From an institutionalist perspective, I acknowledge that historical status-quo bias is powerful but also that the local median voter's locus is not static; it can migrate with sustained, credible elite cueing and shifting perceived stakes.

One new argument worth integrating is the very high level of elite, bipartisan No messaging and the potential for an even stronger late No swing as undecideds break that direction, but this is offset only slightly by the extraordinary nationalization and Democratic mobilization.

Multiple specialists (including PolicyFeedbackTheory and CollectiveActionTheory) emphasize the cross-partisan, respected opposition and the strong status-quo bias among late deciders and in single-measure special elections, patterns that have repeatedly proven robust against even strong partisan tilt and campaign spending. As a voter mobilization expert, I recognize the capacity for turnout but must also weight historic turnout overperformance in similarly polarizing circumstances, which has usually been insufficient to overcome 'No' trends.

Conservative donors have challenged the measure, arguing it would disproportionately affect GOP seats. The most recent contribution came from Charles T.\u202fMunger\u202fJr., who gave $10\u202fmillion to the 'No on Prop.\u202f50 \u2013 Protect Voters First' campaign, according to the Los\u202fAngeles\u202fTimes.

Gavin Newsom is proposing a constitutional amendment (Proposition\u202f50) that would temporarily redraw U.S. House districts to add five Democratic seats for the 2026 mid\u2011term elections. The measure, which has the support of the state\u2019s Democratic legislature, faces uncertainty because voters may be confused or opposed to change.  \n\n- Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in California by nearly 2\u2011to\u20111, yet the amendment could still be close, as the current U.S. House composition is 219 Republican seats, 213 Democratic seats, with three vacancies.\n- Newsom warned in an email that the election would not be easy, saying, \u2018I wish I could tell you this election was going to be easy, but it won\u00b4t.\u2019\n- Opponents argue the proposal would split racial and ethnic communities and overturn the independent commission that voters approved more than a decade ago.  Rep. Kevin\u202fKiley said, \u2018The people put the (independent) commission in place. The politicians are trying to abolish it.\u2019\n- Supporters claim the measure counters Republican gains in Texas and would keep California\u2019s Democratic advantage.  Kiley added, \u2018Voting \u2018yes\u2019 will return us to an era of political gerrymandering.\u2019\n- The amendment would be the only statewide issue on the November ballot, making turnout and voter motivation uncertain.

Proposition\u202f50 would authorize temporary changes to California\u2019s congressional district maps for the next three elections (2026,\u202f2028,\u202f2030) while still requiring a nonpartisan federal\u2011law\u2011compliant redistricting commission after the 2030 Census. The piece explains that redistricting is normally done every ten years by state commissions, and contrasts California\u2019s nonpartisan process with partisan gerrymandering, citing the 2024 Texas redistricting that eliminated five Democratic seats and the Florida redistricting efforts that have flipped Democratic seats. It notes that Governor Gavin\u202fNewsom has proposed the special election only with public consent, framing the measure as a defense of democratic representation. The article includes the Spanish phrase 'Lea este art\u00edculo en espa\u00f1ol aqu\u00ed.' and the statement 'BenitoLink invites all community members to share their ideas and opinions.'

Schwarzenegger told a crowd at the University of Southern California that \"They are trying to fight for democracy by getting rid of the democratic principles of California,\" and said that rejecting Proposition\u202f50 was \"a no\u2011brainer\" because the map\u2011drawing process lacked transparency. The piece notes that Republicans currently hold a 219\u2011212 edge in the U.S. House, with four vacancies, and that a Democratic flip could block President Trump\u2019s agenda. It also quotes Lance Christensen of the California Policy Center, who says Schwarzenegger\u2019s legacy policy and his criticism of Trump make him a powerful spokesman for voters opposed to the measure. Matt Klink, president of Klink Campaigns, Inc., adds that Schwarzenegger\u2019s endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris gives him credibility among California voters. The article mentions that Schwarzenegger has not recorded campaign ads or raised money for the opposition, but his team allowed a committee to film his USC appearance. Amy Thoma Tan, a spokeswoman for an opposition campaign funded by Republican donor Charles\u202fMunger\u202fJr., says Schwarzenegger\u2019s appeal transcends politics. Munger has donated $30\u202fmillion to the cause. The article also notes that Newsom and other Democratic leaders framed the measure as essential to preserving democracy, with Newsom declaring it a \"profound and consequential moment in American history.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/state/3816222/arnold-schwarzenegger-star-appeal-tested-proposition-50-redistricting/)\n\n**Coachella Valley activists back Prop. 50 as California faces redistricting battle**\nDozens of residents gathered at Rancho Mirage City Hall for a peaceful protest supporting Proposition 50, a measure introduced by Gov.

He frames the Trump administration as a threat to freedoms, citing the National Guard\u2019s deployment to cities, the removal of federal aid to vulnerable communities, and the potential for \u2018brutal foreign prisons\u2019 without due process. He claims that Trump\u2019s Republican Party holds a slim five\u2011seat majority in the U.S. House and that Trump has sought five new Republican districts in Texas, which he says dilute representation for voters of color. He notes that Texas Democrats left the legislature in protest but returned after California legislators passed the Election Rigging Response Act. He argues that Proposition\u202f50 would temporarily redraw districts to level the playing field for the 2026 midterms and that it preserves the Citizens Redistricting Commission.

The piece claims the effort is an \"open attempt at election rigging\" and a \"calculated assault on election integrity,\" arguing that it undermines California\u2019s independent redistricting commission established by a 2008 constitutional amendment.

The governor\u2019s defense that the move is a defensive response to Texas redistricting is dismissed as flimsy.

Gavin Newsom that would temporarily allow Democrats to redraw congressional maps for the 2026 election and keep those maps in effect through 2028 and 2030. Schwarzenegger called the measure 'insane' and said it would add five Democratic U.S. House seats to counter what he described as Trump\u2019s attempt to create five Republican seats in Texas. He warned that 'Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right' and that voting yes would 'go backwards' for democracy. Newsom defended the proposal as a temporary counter to a 'clear attempt to rig the 2026 midterm congressional elections', noting that Trump had urged Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to create five GOP seats.

Gavin Newsom\u2019s attempt to add five Democratic seats to California\u2019s congressional delegation through Proposition\u202f50 is part of a broader redistricting war that pits the Democratic Party against Republican\u2011led states and President Trump\u2019s own redistricting agenda.  Newsom has urged Democrats to \u2018play hardball\u2019 in response to Trump\u2019s push for Texas and other red states to redraw maps, saying, \u2018We tried to hold hands and talk about the way the world should be.  We can\u2019t just think differently, we have to act differently.\u2019  A flyer sent to voters by postal workers denounced the plan, citing a statement from Gloria Chun Hoo, president of the California League of Women Voters, who warned that \u2018California has become a national model for independent redistricting\u2019 and urged the public to reject \u2018the dangerous idea of mid\u2011cycle redistricting.\u2019  The piece notes that if Prop.\u202f50 passes, it would give Democrats five seats but merely offset the five seats Republicans hope to gain in Texas, leaving the 2026 election outcome to be decided in other states.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Republicans could gain up to six House seats nationwide from a full\u2011scale redistricting battle, and a UC\u202fBerkeley poll found only 48% overall support for Prop.\u202f50 (55% among high\u2011propensity voters), below the roughly 60% threshold needed for a strong campaign.  The article frames the measure as a proxy war between Newsom and Trump and a test of Newsom\u2019s 2028 presidential ambitions, while noting that the stakes are high for both parties\u2019 control of Congress.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 30, 2025 07:55 PM\nSource:[Marin Independent Journal](https://www.marinij.com/2025/08/30/the-stakes-for-a-redistricting-war-differ-between-newsom-and-californians/)\n\n**Opinion: Gov. Newsom playing for a tie in national redistricting battle**\nThe column argues that Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s push for a mid\u2011cycle redistricting measure (Prop.\u202f50) is a strategic play for a tie in the 2026 congressional race.  Newsom signed legislation that would give Democrats five additional seats, while Republicans in Texas are seeking a similar gain.  The author notes that even if Prop.\u202f50 passes, the net effect would be a balance of five seats each side, leaving the outcome of the 2026 election to other states.  Newsom\u2019s rhetoric is quoted: 'We tried to hold hands and talk about the way the world should be,' Newsom said. 'We can't just think differently, we have to act differently.'  Gloria Chun Hoo, president of the California League of Women Voters, warned against mid\u2011cycle redistricting: 'California has become a national model for independent redistricting,' Hoo\u2019s statement read. 'Let's protect the integrity of our democratic process and reject the dangerous idea of mid\u2011cycle redistricting.'  The piece cites a UC\u202fBerkeley poll that found 48\u202f% support among all voters and 55\u202f% among high\u2011propensity voters for Prop.\u202f50, below the roughly 60\u202f% threshold that campaign advisers say is needed for a ballot\u2011measure win.  It also references a report that Republicans could gain up to six House seats nationwide if a full\u2011scale redistricting war erupts, and a Wall Street Journal article noting that more than a dozen red states and three blue states could redraw maps for 2026 without a special election.  The column frames the debate as a proxy war between Trump and Newsom, suggesting that the stakes extend beyond California to the national political landscape.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 28, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[Times of San Diego](https://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2025/08/28/newsom-playing-for-tie-in-national-redistricting-battle/)\n\n**Redistricting opponents immediately appeal to CA voters**\nOpponents of California\u2019s congressional redistricting launched a campaign of mail\u2011to\u2011door ads just before the Legislature approved Proposition\u202f50, the Election Rigging Response Act, which would allow Democrats to redraw districts to gain five seats.  The campaign, backed by the Protect Voters First coalition and its top funder Charles\u202fT.\u202fMunger,\u202fJr., claims to spend up to $100\u202fmillion to defeat the measure.  The ads urge voters to \"Vote no in the special election,\" and feature statements from former commission chair Jeanne\u202fRaya: 'California \u2013 Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2013 should stand against any attempt to politicize our redistricting process.'  Right Path California also mailed ads accusing Newsom and other Democrats of \"unconstitutional gerrymandering\" and a \"political power grab.\"  The effort is joined by former Gov. Arnold\u202fSchwarzenegger, former Speaker Kevin\u202fMcCarthy, and former Republican chair Jessica\u202fMillan\u202fPatterson, who together form a committee to defeat Proposition\u202f50.  The California Democratic Party, meanwhile, endorsed the measure, citing Texas Republicans\u2019 manipulation of district lines as a threat to democracy.  The campaign highlights that the Texas Legislature\u2019s map could give Republicans five additional House seats, while Democrats in California aim to counter that shift.  The ads and statements are part of a broader political battle over the state\u2019s independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, created in 2008 and expanded in 2010 to include congressional districts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 10:45 PM\nSource:[KTEN Ada/Sherman](https://www.kten.com/news/redistricting-opponents-immediately-appeal-to-ca-voters/article_9077e7cb-3bbb-5271-98b8-2a9a4dbdd931.html)\n\n**What's next for California redistricting? An expensive election**\nThe California special election on Nov.\u202f4 will decide whether to adopt Proposition\u202f50, a redistricting plan that would replace the current congressional maps with ones designed to reduce the number of seats where registered Republican voters have the advantage from nine to four.  According to the article, the Yes\u2011on\u201150 campaign\u2014also called the Election\u202fRigging Response Act\u2014has raised more than $9\u202fmillion from over 250,000 small\u2011donor contributions, with $1.8\u202fmillion raised on the Thursday the California Legislature passed the legislation that Newsom signed.  The campaign\u2019s spokesperson, Hannah\u202fMilgrom, said, 'Prop\u202f50 is the country's best hope to counter Trump's Texas power grab and ensure a fair 2026 national mid\u2011term election.'  In contrast, the No\u2011on\u201150 campaign, backed by megadonor Charles\u202fMunger\u202fJr., has signaled a costly counter\u2011campaign.  Munger\u2019s spokesperson, Amy\u202fThoma\u202fTan, said, 'We'll have the resources to make sure people understand why gerrymandering is anti\u2011democratic.'  Former House Speaker Kevin\u202fMcCarthy and the Stop Sacramento's Power Grab group also oppose the measure, with chair Jessica\u202fMillan\u202fPatterson calling the maps a 'power grab.'  The article notes that the proposed maps would give Democrats five additional seats in the U.S.\u202fHouse, a claim that critics argue amounts to a new form of gerrymandering.  The piece reports support from high\u2011profile figures such as former President Barack\u202fObama, Sen. Cory\u202fBooker, and former Gov. Arnold\u202fSchwarzenegger, who has historically championed California\u2019s independent redistricting commission.  Overall, the article presents both sides\u2019 arguments and financial data without editorializing, offering a balanced overview of the upcoming vote.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 04:33 AM\nSource:[San Jose Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/25/whats-next-for-california-redistricting-an-expensive-election/)\n\n**Gavin Newsom Now Counters Texas Republicans With Redistricting Plan**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill on August 21, 2025 that temporarily suspends the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission and gives lawmakers authority to redraw congressional maps for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. The plan, to be voted on in a special election on November 4, aims to flip five Republican\u2011held seats and strengthen four competitive ones, mirroring Texas Republicans\u2019 mid\u2011decade redistricting that could add five GOP seats in Texas. Newsom framed the move as a \u2018neutralization\u2019 of Texas\u2019s gerrymander, saying, 'We\u2019re responding to what occurred in Texas. We\u2019re neutralizing what occurred, and we\u2019re giving the American people a fair chance.' The proposal, dubbed Proposition\u202f50, would merge conservative Shasta County with liberal Marin County and other district mergers, shifting the balance toward Democrats. California currently sends 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans to Congress out of 52 seats, while statewide voter registration is about 38% Republican. A Los Angeles Times/Berkeley poll shows 75% of California voters approve of Newsom\u2019s handling of the issue, compared with his overall 38% approval rating. Former President Barack Obama endorsed the plan, calling it \u2018a smart, measured approach\u2019 to a \u2018particular problem.\u2019 Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher criticized the plan as a power grab, saying, 'It\u2019s about power on both sides, rigging congressional districts to get partisan results. That\u2019s what a gerrymander is.' The measure could cost up to $200\u202fmillion and faces legal challenges from Republicans, former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and philanthropist Charles Munger Jr. Nationally, a Politico/Morning Consult poll shows Democrats overwhelmingly back California\u2019s effort, while conservatives accuse Newsom of hypocrisy. If passed, the maps could keep the House split 50\u201150 in 2026, but deepen polarization and may trigger similar mid\u2011decade redistricting in other states.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 10:21 PM\nSource:[FrankNez Media](https://franknez.com/gavin-newsom-now-counters-texas-republicans-with-redistricting-plan/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=gavin-newsom-now-counters-texas-republicans-with-redistricting-plan)\n\n**The fight over California redistricting enters new phase**\nCalifornia Democrats appear to have secured a new congressional map through the state legislature, but the battle over the map\u2014known as Proposition\u202f50\u2014has only just begun. With 74 days until the November vote, Gov. Gavin Newsom and allies must persuade voters to approve an extraordinary mid\u2011decade redrawing that could give Democrats five additional House seats, countering Republican gains in Texas. Opponents\u2014an unlikely coalition of Republican leaders, good\u2011government advocates and former GOP governor Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2014are preparing a heavy advertising push. Amy Thoma Tan, spokeswoman for Protect Voters First, said, 'It's really a September campaign,' and noted that the group will be financially backed by Charles Munger Jr. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy confirmed he will help raise money for the opposition group Stop Sacramento's Power Grab. The campaign is expected to exceed nine figures in spending. Newsom\u2019s operation has already raised $6.2\u202fmillion in seven days from more than 200,000 donors. Voter turnout is uncertain; a 2016 recall of Newsom saw 58% participation. Jessica Millan Patterson, former chair of the California Republican Party, warned, 'It's going to be an expensive ballot initiative,' and emphasized the stakes for 2026 races. The measure is framed as a check on President Trump\u2019s influence, with Hannah Milgrom of Yes on\u202f50 calling it 'the country's best hope to counter Trump's Texas power grab.' A May poll found only one in three Californians approved of Trump\u2019s job performance. Newsom\u2019s approval stands at 46% overall and 36% among independents, according to the Institute\u2019s poll. Republicans are also monitoring former governor Schwarzenegger\u2019s stance, while Democrats look to former President Barack Obama for support. The campaign\u2019s outcome will determine whether Democrats can offset Republican gains in the House for the remainder of Trump\u2019s second term.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 22, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[KESQ.com](https://kesq.com/news/national-politics/cnn-us-politics/2025/08/22/the-fight-over-california-redistricting-enters-new-phase/)\n\n**California Democrats plow ahead in redistricting fight**\nCalifornia Democrats are poised to vote Thursday on a bill that would trigger a statewide special election to redraw the state's congressional map, aiming to secure five additional House seats in the 2026 midterms. The California Supreme Court rejected a petition by Republican legislators to halt Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D) mid\u2011decade redistricting plan. Newsom framed the effort as a response to Texas's GOP\u2011friendly redistricting, which Texas Republicans hope will net them five extra House seats. Newsom said, 'We're fighting fire with fire, and we're gonna punch these sons of b\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011es in the mouth,' on 'The Siren Podcast.' Texas lawmakers advanced a new map after a two\u2011week delay; the Texas Senate is expected to sign it, with Gov. Greg Abbott (R) slated to approve. Trump posted on Truth Social, 'Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.' California's independent commission would normally set the maps, but the proposed bill would let voters approve or reject the new map in a November special election. Early polls show most Californians oppose mid\u2011decade redistricting, though Newsom's pollster reports widespread support. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and Speaker Mike Johnson (R\u2011La.) have pledged to fight the push. A Reuters survey found most voters believe partisan redistricting threatens democracy, and the Kansas City Star reports Missouri Republicans are considering a gerrymander, following other states such as Florida, Indiana, Illinois and New York.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 07:50 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/newsletters/evening-report/5464311-california-dems-texas-gop-redistricting-jd-vance-georgia-map-ukraine-zelensky-russia-dc-patrol-newsom-lisa-cook/)\n\n**California lawmakers approve Democratic gerrymandering plan**\nCalifornia lawmakers approved a bill that would place a measure on the November\u202f2025 ballot to temporarily replace the state\u2019s U.S. House districts with new maps drawn by Democratic members of Congress, according to the article. The new maps would flip five seats currently held by Republicans, a figure cited in the report. The legislation, dubbed the Election\u202fRigging\u202fResponse\u202fAct, was signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and was passed by the legislature after the California Supreme Court dismissed a Republican challenge. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said, 'Today we give every Californian the power to say 'No''. Senate President Mike McGuire said, 'We're here today for one reason: the nefarious actions of the Republican leadership in Texas.' The bill follows Texas Republicans\u2019 plan to redraw districts to give Trump\u2019s party five seats, a move that the article notes was announced by Trump on Truth\u202fSocial. The article notes that the new maps would add Democratic voters to battleground districts in the San\u202fJoaquin\u202fValley and southern California, including Rep. David Valadao\u2019s district, and would protect competitive seats held by Democrats such as Rep. Adam Gray. The maps do not significantly change Bay\u202fArea lines, which are all Democratic. Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers and approved the bill despite Republican opposition. The article cites that former President Barack Obama supported the redistricting, while former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger opposed it. Mailers urging voters to reject the measure were already circulating, funded by a committee backed by Republican megadonor Charles\u202fMunger. The article also reports that Newsom has raised more than $6\u202fmillion for the campaign, according to the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 03:32 PM\nSource:[San Jose Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/21/california-lawmakers-approve-democratic-gerrymandering-plan/)\n\n**Newsom has a plan to give Democrats a leg up for the midterms**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to hold a special election in the first week of November so voters can approve a new U.S. House district map that could give Democrats an advantage in the 2026 midterms. Newsom said he would temporarily suspend the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission and present an alternative map directly to voters, arguing that the current process could be used by Republicans to \u2018rig the game\u2019. He highlighted that California currently has 52 state House seats, of which Democrats hold 43, and that the proposed special election could cost more than $200\u202fmillion. The Legislature is on summer recess until Aug.\u202f18, and the Democratic caucuses in the Senate and Assembly are preparing a two\u2011thirds majority ballot measure to move the plan forward. The governor emphasized transparency, saying, 'We will go to the people of this state in a transparent way and ask them to consider the new circumstances\u2026 It\u2019s going to be given to the voters for their consideration in a very transparent way so they know exactly what they\u2019re doing.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 12:04 AM\nSource:[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/california-redistricting-november-ballot/)\n\n",

    "summary": "The expert forecasts on Proposition 50\u2014California's proposed mid-cycle redistricting measure\u2014are closely divided, reflecting significant uncertainty. Across the disciplines of political science, law, campaign strategy, sociology, public administration, and California studies, forecasts generally fall in a narrow range between 38% and 68% likelihood of passage. \n\nKey Points of Expert Consensus:\n- Most experts note current polling shows a modest Yes lead (48-51%) with a substantial undecided bloc (~15%), but historical base rates caution that such measures often lose ground as Election Day nears.\n- There is broad agreement that controversial California ballot initiatives requiring institutional change\u2014especially those perceived as partisan 'power grabs' or as rolling back popular reforms like the Citizens Redistricting Commission\u2014typically face late resistance and tend to fail unless polling support is well above 55-60% approaching the vote.\n- Experts stress that mobilization, campaign spending, elite endorsements (for and against), turnout dynamics in a special election, and framing (as a necessary defense against Texas gerrymandering vs. an attack on democratic process) are pivotal.\n- While California\u2019s strong Democratic advantage and effective mobilization efforts (by DNC/Newsom/Obama) increase odds for passage, the potential for high-profile bipartisan opposition (Schwarzenegger, Munger Jr., 'good government' groups) to persuade moderates and sway undecided voters toward No is a strong countervailing force.\n- Special election turnout, with Prop 50 as the only statewide item on the ballot, amplifies unpredictability\u2014possibly favoring the motivated Democratic base or status-quo-oriented voters more responsive to institutionalist arguments.\n- Several experts highlight the possibility of late-breaking No momentum due to status-quo bias, ballot complexity, and effective negative campaigning, with the risk of soft Yes supporters abstaining or switching.\n\nOpinion Range:\n- Forecasts range from as low as 38% (California Studies\u2014Direct Democracy Tradition) to as high as 68% (Election Law\u2014Redistricting Standards), with the cluster of most forecast probabilities in the 40\u201358% range. Only two forecasts exceed 60%, both arguing that extraordinary partisan context and mobilization efforts may override historic headwinds.\n\nOverall Synthesis:\nWhile there's no overwhelming consensus, the expert median and mode cluster slightly below 50%, indicating a modest lean toward failure (No), despite strong Democratic advantages and polling leads. Experts are virtually unanimous in warning that the history of similar initiatives and prevailing institutional norms are significant hurdles. The most likely scenario is a close, high-variance contest where late-campaign dynamics and turnout will be decisive. Most believe Prop 50's chances of passage are real but not solid, and the outcome will likely be determined by whether partisan mobilization or process-legitimacy skepticism wins the framing war in the campaign's final stretch.",
