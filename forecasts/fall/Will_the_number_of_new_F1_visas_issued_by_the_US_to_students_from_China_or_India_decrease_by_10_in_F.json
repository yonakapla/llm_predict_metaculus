While the possibility of a late rebound is not technically eliminated, all operational and demand-side indicators continue to point downward, and the magnitude of mid-year drop aligns with the question\u2019s 10% threshold. Precedent from similar disruptions (e.g., 2017-2019 during early Trump era) also supports the likelihood of a >10% decline for China under such conditions. University efforts to counteract these trends are not sufficient given federal control of visa issuance.

While year-to-year volatility and the possibility of a late rebound warrant caution, the convergence of policy, administrative, and demand shifts points strongly toward a >10% annual decline: a drop to 70,000\u201374,000 visas is highly probable. My estimate therefore is high in confidence, but not absolute: a base-rate rebound or overcorrection by US authorities in the final months could nudge the numbers just above the line, but the modal scenario is clear decline.",

Through my own perspective in China Studies, the social and peer-driven retreat from US applications only adds to this. Group input reinforced the weight of structural, not merely psychological, obstacles. To the extent that some argued for an even higher probability (notably SociologySocialNetworkTheory and PoliticalScienceInternationalRelationsTheory), their reasoning aligns with my sense of downside risk, especially as no evidence of catch-up exists in the late summer window. Therefore, I slightly revise my probability upward to 90%.",

We have seen:\n\n> \\- High-profile visa revocations and deportations\n\n> \\- New policies creating extra hurdles for international students, such as social media vetting and temporary suspensions of visa issuance\n\n> \\- Increased funding and enforcement activities by immigration authorities (ICE)\n\n> \\- Arbitrary SEVP (student permit) revocations\n\nSamotsvety has assessed a 76% chance of a >10% decline in F-1 visas for Chinese students and a 66% chance for Indian students, with the following reasoning:\n\n> As of May 2025, the number of new visas for FY2025 was [substantially lower than FY2024](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-visa-statistics.html) for both China and India. This decrease continued a trend from 2024, when new F-1 visa numbers dropped by [34% for India and 3.6% for China](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/). In principle, this decline could be counterbalanced by a rebound during the summer, when the majority of new student visas are issued. But the lower visa numbers over the past year suggest that studying in the US has become less appealing. Actions by the Trump administration this year may accelerate this trend, making potential international students more cautious about studying in the US. Chinese students in particular may be wary in light of comments by the State Department about mass visa revocation for Chinese students.\n\n> On top of decreased demand, the [visa interview freeze](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/important-update-regarding-f-m-and-j-visa-interview-appointments/#:~:text=UPDATE%20\\(6/19/25,The%20pause%20is%20temporary.) from May 27-June 18 blocked new visas for a large fraction of the peak season, limiting the time window for a potential rebound. We expect this to lead to a decrease in processed applications, and a lower number of new F-1\u2019s overall. [New rules for social media vetting](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/06/announcement-of-expanded-screening-and-vetting-for-visa-applicants) may decrease the acceptance rate, though we believe this will have a smaller effect than the reduction in the overall number of applications.\n\n> A few sources of uncertainty limit the confidence of our forecast. The number of F-1 visas is volatile from year to year, particularly for individual countries. If last year\u2019s change reflects a temporary drop rather than a sustained trend, baseline volatility and regression to the mean could lead to higher F-1 issuance in 2025, counterbalancing the effects of the visa freeze and new social media vetting. Universities facing funding challenges may also be incentivized to accept more international students, who often pay more in tuition than US students.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39113,\"question_id\":38443}}`",

It's Costing All of Us.**\nThe article argues that President Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s visa\u2011policy changes have created an \"invisible border wall\" that is harming the U.S. economy and society.  It cites that in fiscal year\u202f2024 U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered over 2\u202fmillion people at the southern border, while the State Department issued almost 11\u202fmillion temporary visas and hundreds of thousands of green cards during the same period, showing a mismatch between border enforcement and visa issuance.  The piece notes that the State Department has sharply limited waivers of visa interviews, which will \"supercharge already crushing wait times,\" and that U.S. consulates are experiencing bottlenecks: a tourist visa at the Ciudad\u202fJu\u00e1rez consulate now takes 11\u202fmonths, the next appointment in Abu\u202fDhabi is 18\u202fmonths away, and wait times in India can exceed a year.  It reports that the department is reviewing more than 55\u202fmillion visa holders for violations, and has revoked more than twice as many visas since the end of January as in the same period the previous year.  The article claims that expanded social\u2011media vetting of international student applicants will lead to a projected 30\u201140\u202f% plunge in new student arrivals this fall, costing universities $7\u202fbillion in revenue and wiping out 60\u202f000 jobs.  Congress added a $250 \"visa integrity\" fee on top of the $185 application cost, and the U.S. Travel Association projects that the fee could cost the economy $11\u202fbillion over three years, including $9.4\u202fbillion in lost visitor spending and $1.3\u202fbillion in lost tax revenue.  A pilot program imposing visa bonds up to $15\u202f000 for visitors from high\u2011overstay countries is also mentioned.  The article cites a travel ban that now restricts nationals from 19 countries, noting that in 2022 nearly 300\u202f000 people from those countries arrived in the U.S. and that their households earned $3.2\u202fbillion in income, paid $715.6\u202fmillion in taxes, and had $2.5\u202fbillion in spending power.  It warns that a potential expansion to 36 more countries could choke off further economic activity.  Recent data show that U.S. consulates issued 16\u202f% fewer temporary visas and 20\u202f% fewer green cards in May\u202f2025 than in May\u202f2024, and that over 300\u202f000 fewer overseas visitors came to the U.S. during the first seven months of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024.  The World Travel and Tourism Council projects a 22\u202f% plunge in international visitor spending this year, a $12.5\u202fbillion loss, and notes that the U.S. is the only country among 184 studied expected to see a decline.  The piece concludes that treating every visitor as a threat keeps out not only terrorists but also talent, paying students, families, and ordinary travelers whose spending supports American jobs, and warns that continued suspicion and obstruction could turn the U.S. into a country that fewer people want to visit or build a future in.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 04:24 PM\nSource:[Slate Magazine](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/09/immigration-trump-border-wall-visa-denials.html)\n\n**Trump admin to limit visa durations for students, journalists**\nThe Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would impose fixed time limits on visas for foreign students, cultural exchange visitors and media members, replacing the current flexible 'duration of status' system that has been in place since 1978. The changes would cap F visas for international students and J visas for exchange visitors at four years maximum, while I visas for foreign media would be limited to 240 days with extension options. Currently, these visa holders can remain in the U.S. for the duration of their program or employment without fixed time limits. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said, 'For too long, past Administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the U.S. virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amounts of taxpayer dollars and disadvantaging U.S. citizens.' The public has 30 days to comment on the measure, which mirrors a 2020 proposal that was later withdrawn by the Biden administration. The changes could significantly affect the 1.6\u202fmillion international students on F visas. Overall, Chinese nationals represent roughly 25\u202f% of all foreign students. A July\u202f2025 report from the Institute of International Education (IIE) shows that international student enrollment has already dropped, with 35\u202f% of surveyed schools reporting decreased applications this fall compared to 17\u202f% the previous year. Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA: Association of International Educators, said, 'It will certainly act as an additional deterrent to international students choosing to study in the United States, to the detriment of American economies, innovation and global competitiveness.' The visa restrictions disproportionately impact Asian populations, who comprise approximately 13\u202fmillion immigrants and represent the largest share of temporary visa holders nationwide. Enforcement has already intensified, with the State Department revoking over 6,000 student visas this year\u2014nearly four times more than the same period in 2024\u2014primarily for alleged overstays and legal violations. Simultaneously, the administration is reviewing over 55\u202fmillion valid visa holders through 'continuous vetting' that includes social media monitoring and requires applicants to disable privacy settings during visa interviews. New screening protocols also target 'anti-American ideologies or activities,' though the State Department has not clearly defined these terms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 03:48 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trump-admin-limit-visa-durations-154850251.html)\n\n**Chinese and Indian Students Seek Refuge in Australia, Escalating Deportation Crisis**\nThe Epoch Times reports that nearly 100,000 foreign students in Australia are extending their stay by applying for asylum visas, with 98,979 applications rejected as of July\u202f31\u202f2025 and 27,100 still pending. 5,000 of those who lost their appeals are reportedly living illegally in the country.  The article cites former immigration deputy Abul Rizvi, who said, '\u91cc\u8332\u7dad\u547c\u7c72\u653f\u5e9c\u63a1\u53d6\u7dca\u6025\u63aa\u65bd\u4f86\u8655\u7406\u7b49\u5f85\u9063\u8fd4\u7684\u4eba\u6578\u4e0d\u65b7\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u554f\u984c', urging the government to increase deportations and crack down on intermediaries aiding fake refugees.  Between July\u202f1\u202f2024 and June\u202f30\u202f2025, Australia received 23,576 asylum applications, approved 4,036 (\u2248\u202f17\u202f%) and rejected 24,924 (\u2248\u202f84\u202f%).  Only 162 applicants were deported during that period.  Indian applicants submitted 2,596 applications, 5,633 were rejected (\u2248\u202f57\u202f% of all rejections) and only 42\u201360 were approved (\u2248\u202f1\u20131.5\u202f% of approvals).  Chinese applicants filed 2,494 applications, 3,538 were rejected (\u2248\u202f14\u202f% of all rejections) and about 290 were approved (\u2248\u202f7\u202f% of approvals).  The article also notes that in the 2006\u20132007 fiscal year, 103,000 international students arrived in Australia, 44\u202f% finished their studies and returned home, 39\u202f% obtained permanent residency, and 17\u202f% stayed on temporary visas.  The Albanese government announced an increase of 25,000 places for international students in 2026, raising the total to 295,000.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 03:55 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/9/8/n14589707.htm)\n\n**Open US university doors to more of China's students  --  IF they love...**\nThe article argues that the United States should open its higher\u2011education system to more Chinese students, citing President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to admit 600,000 Chinese students and the White House\u2019s clarification that the figure represented \u2018two years\u2019 worth of visas. It notes that, in reality, about 277,000 Chinese students are currently in the U.S., compared with 331,000 from India, and that fewer than 90,000 of those are undergraduates. The piece counters the myth that foreign students take seats from Americans by pointing out that, out of nearly 16\u202fmillion U.S. undergraduates in fall\u202f2023, 342,000 (\u22482\u202f%) were foreigners, and that 844,000 international students enrolled in graduate programs and paid full tuition, which subsidises scholarships and keeps many public\u2011university programs viable. A 2017 study is cited to show that foreign\u2011student tuition helped some states trim education budgets and avoid raising tuition for Americans. The author also highlights the economic and geopolitical benefits of retaining international students, claiming that the average graduate who stays in the U.S. reduces the national debt by millions over 30\u202fyears and that brain drain is a strategic advantage against authoritarian regimes. The article calls for enhanced social\u2011media vetting, direct questioning of applicants from authoritarian countries, exemption of foreigners with advanced STEM degrees from green\u2011card caps, and streamlined work visas for graduates. It concludes with a personal anecdote: \u2018I came to the United States from Venezuela as an international student, driven by the desire for freedom and my opposition to socialism.\u2019\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 02:18 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/09/07/opinion/open-us-universities-to-chinas-students-if-they-love-america/)\n\n**Are Chinese Students Still Welcome in the U.S.?**\nTrump recently announced that he would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the U.S. over the next two years, but U.S. immigration policy has tightened. The article reports that in the 2023/24 academic year, 112\u202fmillion+ international students were enrolled in the U.S., a 6.6\u202f% increase, with 277,398 Chinese students\u2014a 4.2\u202f% drop from the previous year. It cites a case of a Chinese student, Gu, who was denied entry at U.S. customs and barred from returning for five years. The piece quotes a Beijing Normal University senior, Zhang, who says '\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u540c\u5b66\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8fd8\u662f\u60f3\u53bb\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u522b\u7684\u4e0d\u8bf4\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u5e02\u573a\u662f\u6700\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u542c\u8bf4\u6709\u4e9b\u5b66\u957f\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6bd5\u4e1a\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u62ff\u5230\u5341\u51e0\u4e07\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e8c\u5341\u51e0\u4e07\u7f8e\u91d1\u7684\u5e74\u85aa'.

The changes would cap F visas for international students and J visas for exchange visitors at four years maximum, while I visas for foreign media would be limited to 240 days with extension options. Currently, these visa holders can remain in the U.S. for the duration of their program or employment without fixed time limits. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said, 'For too long, past Administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the U.S. virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amounts of taxpayer dollars and disadvantaging U.S. citizens.' The public has 30 days to comment on the measure, which mirrors a 2020 proposal that was later withdrawn by the Biden administration. The changes could significantly affect the 1.6\u202fmillion international students on F visas. Overall, Chinese nationals represent roughly 25\u202f% of all foreign students. A July\u202f2025 report from the Institute of International Education (IIE) shows that international student enrollment has already dropped, with 35\u202f% of surveyed schools reporting decreased applications this fall compared to 17\u202f% the previous year. Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA: Association of International Educators, said, 'It will certainly act as an additional deterrent to international students choosing to study in the United States, to the detriment of American economies, innovation and global competitiveness.' The visa restrictions disproportionately impact Asian populations, who comprise approximately 13\u202fmillion immigrants and represent the largest share of temporary visa holders nationwide. Enforcement has already intensified, with the State Department revoking over 6,000 student visas this year\u2014nearly four times more than the same period in 2024\u2014primarily for alleged overstays and legal violations. Simultaneously, the administration is reviewing over 55\u202fmillion valid visa holders through 'continuous vetting' that includes social media monitoring and requires applicants to disable privacy settings during visa interviews. New screening protocols also target 'anti-American ideologies or activities,' though the State Department has not clearly defined these terms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 03:48 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trump-admin-limit-visa-durations-154850251.html)\n\n**Chinese and Indian Students Seek Refuge in Australia, Escalating Deportation Crisis**\nThe Epoch Times reports that nearly 100,000 foreign students in Australia are extending their stay by applying for asylum visas, with 98,979 applications rejected as of July\u202f31\u202f2025 and 27,100 still pending. 5,000 of those who lost their appeals are reportedly living illegally in the country.

It notes that, in reality, about 277,000 Chinese students are currently in the U.S., compared with 331,000 from India, and that fewer than 90,000 of those are undergraduates. The piece counters the myth that foreign students take seats from Americans by pointing out that, out of nearly 16\u202fmillion U.S. undergraduates in fall\u202f2023, 342,000 (\u22482\u202f%) were foreigners, and that 844,000 international students enrolled in graduate programs and paid full tuition, which subsidises scholarships and keeps many public\u2011university programs viable. A 2017 study is cited to show that foreign\u2011student tuition helped some states trim education budgets and avoid raising tuition for Americans. The author also highlights the economic and geopolitical benefits of retaining international students, claiming that the average graduate who stays in the U.S. reduces the national debt by millions over 30\u202fyears and that brain drain is a strategic advantage against authoritarian regimes. The article calls for enhanced social\u2011media vetting, direct questioning of applicants from authoritarian countries, exemption of foreigners with advanced STEM degrees from green\u2011card caps, and streamlined work visas for graduates.

A proposed wage\u2011based selection system for H\u20111B visas would give priority to applicants whose employers offer higher salaries. The administration is also pursuing revocation of citizenship and denaturalization of green\u2011card holders who commit crimes or under\u2011report income. New \"neighbourhood investigation\" procedures require testimonial letters from neighbours, employers, and co\u2011workers before naturalisation. Spouses of US citizens and green\u2011card holders face stricter scrutiny during interviews. The \"Dropbox\" interview waiver for visa applicants has been largely discontinued, requiring in\u2011person interviews for children under 14 and adults over 79, and for F\u20111, H\u20111B, and L\u20111 visa holders. The administration is proposing to change the admission period for F, J, and I visas from \"duration of status\" to a fixed time period, forcing students to leave after a set time. The US has rejected 41% of international student visa applications in the last fiscal year, a ten\u2011year high. The Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows graduates to work for up to three years, faces potential termination under the \"Fairness for High\u2011Skilled Americans Act of 2025\".

Some colleges, especially those with large graduate populations, reported a 15% or greater drop in incoming international students, while others said the hit was softer. Northeastern University pushed back its start date for overseas students by a month. The backlog stemmed from a three\u2011week suspension of visa interviews in May and June to vet students' social\u2011media accounts, described by Shorelight CEO Tom Dretler as 'akin to pausing retail sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas.' When interviews resumed, Dretler said the 'faucet didn't turn on' and 'it's dripped.' In India, 59,000 student visas were issued in summer 2024, but appointments are often released in batches of a few hundred and snapped up immediately. In Ghana, the current official wait time is 11 months. The new vetting mandate has reduced consular capacity, with Vice Provost Balaji Krishnan noting that visa issuances for his students were 50% behind last year's pace. Vice Provost David L. Di Maria said demand exceeded supply. Master\u2019s\u2011degree students were most affected, with UMBC reporting declines in that cohort but growth at undergraduate and doctoral levels. The article also notes that 10% of Foothill\u2011De Anza\u2019s 3,000 international students are from Myanmar, a country subject to a Trump\u2011era travel ban that blocked 150 admitted students. Institutions have relaxed policies to allow late registration and deferment, and some offer online or overseas campus coursework while students wait for visas.

The order, which supersedes the earlier Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that covered arrivals only before 31 December 2014, guarantees that Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians will not be deported. However, the exemption excludes foreigners convicted of serious crimes such as terrorism, espionage, rape, murder, human trafficking, drug trafficking, child abuse, cybercrime, racketeering, counterfeit documents or cryptocurrency offences. The order also empowers state and Union Territory authorities to detain illegal immigrants until deportation and requires carriers transporting undocumented individuals to return them to their country of origin, except in cases involving forged documents that cannot be detected without expert analysis, stowaways or aircraft diverted for reasons beyond carrier control. To strengthen oversight, biometric data collection is mandated for all foreigners applying for visas or registering as Overseas Citizens of India, and border forces such as the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Indian Coast Guard are tasked with capturing biometric and demographic details of illegal entrants before sending them back. Employment of foreign nationals in critical sectors such as power, water and petroleum is now restricted, and special permission is required for foreigners undertaking mountaineering expeditions. Exemptions remain for Indian defence personnel and their families, citizens of Nepal and Bhutan under specific conditions, Tibetan refugees with registration certificates, and registered Sri Lankan Tamil nationals who took shelter in India before 9 January 2015.

The Home Office noted, 'While study visas have remained the most common visa to claim asylum on, claims have decreased in the latest year by 10 per cent.' The decline is partly due to a fall in the total number of study visas issued \u2013 431,725 were granted in the year to June\u202f2025, an 18\u202f% drop from the previous year. Of these, 96\u202f% (413,921) were for main applicants and 17,804 for dependants, an 81\u202f% year\u2011on\u2011year drop in dependant visas versus a modest 4\u202f% decline in main applicants. Despite the overall fall, asylum claimants who previously held a study visa or were dependants still represented 3\u202f% of all study visas in the most recent 12\u202fmonths. Nationality trends show Chinese students remained the largest group with 99,919 visas (24\u202f% of total, 7\u202f% decline), while Indian students accounted for 98,014 visas (24\u202f%, 11\u202f% decline) but rose in the second half of the year, potentially overtaking Chinese students. Pakistani nationals made up 9\u202f% of visas, the US 7\u202f% increase, and Nigerian students saw a 25\u202f% overall decline. Master\u2019s\u2011level study remains the main driver of international mobility, with over 60\u202f% of recent sponsored study visas issued for master\u2019s programmes; 81\u202f% of Indian students and 59\u202f% of Chinese students entered at master\u2019s level. The rise in former students claiming asylum has prompted policy responses, including the White Paper on immigration that proposes cutting the post\u2011study stay for international graduates from two years to 18\u202fmonths, following stricter visa rules introduced in January last year that limited dependant visas to research\u2011based postgraduate programmes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 09:27 PM\nSource:[Times Higher Education (THE)](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/asylum-claims-study-visa-holders-drop-record-high)\n\n**Indian F 1 visas down 44% in 2025; US sees surge in student interest from new regions - BusinessToday**\nAccording to a report by Apply Board, the US issued nearly 89,000 F-1 student visas globally between October 2024 and March 2025, a 15% drop compared to the same period in the previous year. The most notable decline came from India, where visa approvals fell 44%, despite remaining the top source of international students to the US with 14,700 F-1 visas issued. The decline has been attributed to administrative hurdles and stricter vetting processes, including longer processing times, limited appointment availability, and increased social media screening. Meanwhile, countries like Zimbabwe and Vietnam saw significant visa growth, reflecting a broader interest in US education beyond traditional markets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 26, 2025 03:14 AM\nSource:[Business Today](https://www.businesstoday.in/nri/visa/story/indian-f-1-visas-down-44-in-2025-us-sees-surge-in-student-interest-from-new-regions-486436-2025-07-26)\n\n**China, India account for 60% of all year-on-year F-1 visa declines**\nThe US has seen a near 22% drop in F-1 visa issuances in May 2025 compared to May 2024, with India and China accounting for 60% of the decline. India issued 6,984 F-1 visas in May 2025, a 41% drop from 11,829 in May 2024, while China saw a 15.2% drop to 14,409. The decline coincides with a recent report showing F-1 visa issuances fell below 100,000 for the first time in four years. Chinese students are being advised to wait until January 2026 before studying in the US, while Indian students are rethinking plans due to visa concerns and surveillance fears. 'When assessing the current situation, it's important to remember that the number of Chinese students in the US had already been declining pretty sharply in recent years,' said Anna Esaki Smith, cofounder of research consultancy Education Rethink. 'In 2023-2024 there were 277,398 Chinese students in the US, a four percent decline, and that compares with a peak of 372,532 Chinese students in 2019-2020. So, we're talking a drop of over 100,000 students in four years.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 05:03 PM\nSource:[The PIE News](https://thepienews.com/china-india-account-for-60-of-all-year-on-year-f-1-visa-declines/)\n\n**F-1 visas for Indian students dip to lowest March-May level in three years**\nThe number of F-1 visas granted to Indian students between March and May 2025 has dropped to its lowest level for these months since the Covid-19 pandemic, with a 27% decline compared to the same period in 2024. According to the US State Department, just 9,906 F-1 visas were issued to Indian students during this period, down from 14,987 in 2023 and 10,894 in 2022. The US Embassy spokesperson stated that the adjudication of visa applications is critically important to national security and public safety, and that applicants should apply as early as possible and anticipate additional processing time. The US Department of State has initiated a rigorous review of international students' activities, both on-campus and online, and has updated its social media vetting for all international students. The Trump administration's move to stop new student visa interviews and exchange visitor visa applicants has been part of a broader State Department plan to update its social media vetting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 09, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/us-f1-visas-march-may-issued-indian-students-continue-to-fall-trump-state-department-american-universities-2753150-2025-07-09)\n\n**US student visas for Indians from March to May lowest since 2022**\nThe number of F-1 visas issued to Indians between March and May decreased by about 27% compared to the same period in 2024, according to data from the US State Department. This marks the lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic year 2022. An F-1 visa allows students from other countries to study in the US. The decrease in Indians being issued F-1 visas came amid the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on international students. The US has required visa applicants to submit social media identifiers since 2019, and since June, all student and exchange visitor visa applicants globally have been required to make their social media profiles public. A US embassy spokesperson said, 'adjudication of visa applications is critically important to the national security and public safety of the US.' The number of US student visas issued to Indians had fallen by 38% in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. It was unclear if more visa applications were being rejected or if there had been a drop in the applications.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 09, 2025 07:30 AM\nSource:[Scroll.in](https://scroll.in/latest/1084341/us-student-visas-for-indians-from-march-to-may-lowest-since-2022)\n\n**US to Resume International Student Visa Process, with New Scrutiny Requirements**\nThe US Department of State has announced that it will resume the process of issuing 'appointments' for international students, which was temporarily suspended by the Trump administration last month. The Trump administration had put a hold on the process, citing the need to prevent applicants with anti-American sentiments from entering the country. The new administration has announced that all applicants will be required to make their social media accounts public for scrutiny. This move is seen as a response to the recent controversy surrounding the Trump administration's actions against American universities, particularly Harvard, which was accused of being anti-Semitic. The Trump administration had also frozen government funding for these universities, which was worth around $10 million. Many students have been denied visas or had their visas revoked, and some have even been deported. The Open Doors organization, which tracks international student enrollment in the US, reported that 1.1 million international students from 210 countries were enrolled in American colleges in the 2023-2024 academic year. The largest number of students came from India, with 330,000 students, followed by China with 280,000 students. Other countries with significant numbers of students in the US include South Korea, Canada, Taiwan, Vietnam, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Nepal.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: June 19, 2025 06:24 AM\nSource:[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/nepali/articles/c0ep1dr5pn8o)\n\n**US International Student Numbers Remain High Amid Trump Administration Pressure**\nThe Trump administration has recently increased pressure on international students in the US, including temporarily revoking Harvard University's foreign student status and proposing to cancel F-1 visas for certain Chinese students. According to data, the number of foreign students holding student visas remains high, and the economic value brought by international students is significant. As of last year, there were approximately 1.5 million international students holding F-1 or M-1 visas in the US, with New York University (NYU) having the highest number of international students, issuing over 25,000 F-1 visas in 2023. Columbia University ranked third, with over 7,500 F-1 visas issued. In addition to private universities like Harvard and Columbia, public universities such as Arizona State University (ASU) also attract a large number of international students, with over 18,000 international students in 2023. China has long been the largest source country for international students, with 44% of the 107,000 students studying in New York in the 2020-2021 academic year coming from China. If the Trump administration increases scrutiny of Chinese students, tens of thousands of international students may face uncertain status. According to the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers (NAFSA), international students contributed $43.8 billion to the US economy in the 2023-2024 academic year, creating over 378,000 jobs. In New York state, there are over 130,000 international students, with NYU and Columbia alone generating over $2.3 billion in economic income and creating over 20,000 jobs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 06:31 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6813/8786314)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts forecast a high probability that the number of new F-1 visas issued to students from China in FY 2025 will decrease by more than 10% relative to FY 2024, thus predicting a 'Yes' resolution for the question. Their probability estimates range from 80% to 90%, with most clustering at 85% or above.\n\nKey factors cited across disciplines include: 1) A significant administrative shock from a May\u2013June 2025 visa interview freeze during peak issuance season, causing a direct reduction in processing capacity; 2) New policies under the Trump administration, such as stricter social media and ideological vetting, higher visa fees, a surge in F-1 visa revocations, and fixed duration proposals\u2014all increasing barriers and deterring applicants; 3) A perceptible chilling effect on Chinese applicants amplified by news of denials and deportations, network effects, and negative sentiment propagated in both Chinese and international communities; 4) A redirection of Chinese students to alternative destinations like Australia, Canada, and the UK, though these countries themselves have also tightened policies but to a lesser degree than the US; 5) US university advocacy and efforts to recover student flows are acknowledged but judged insufficient to offset federal bottlenecks and stronger deterrents; 6) Base rates show that >10% annual drops outside the pandemic are rare, but this year\u2019s combined administrative, policy, and demand shocks are judged historically atypical and sufficiently large to override mean reversion or late recoveries.\n\nWhile some experts note residual uncertainty due to volatility, the small possibility of a late-season surge in issuance, or exceptional university interventions, all agree that real-time data (notably a ~15% YoY drop in May 2025, rising revocation/denial rates, and evidence of ongoing bottlenecks) support a strong expectation of a decline exceeding 10%. Scenario descriptions align in projecting that only an unprecedented surge in late processing or demand resilience would keep 2025 numbers above the 10% decline threshold. All specialists, whether from administrative, legal, international relations, economic, or sociological perspectives, converge on the conclusion that mid-year trajectory, policy context, and sentiment make a Yes outcome (issuance below 74,389 F-1 visas to Chinese students) highly likely."
