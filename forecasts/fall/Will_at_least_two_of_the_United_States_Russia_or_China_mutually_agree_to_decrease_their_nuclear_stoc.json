Most official talk centers on extension/maintenance of limits, not net reductions, so even if New START is extended, unless the text mandates new reductions, the question will resolve NO.\n- China\u2019s clear position is that it will not join any such reduction arrangement; this essentially rules out trilateral treaty scenarios. U.S.\u2013Russia bilateral action is most likely, but probability remains low given all of the above factors.\n\nHistorically, arms control treaties can be concluded quickly when there's sufficient political will, but the base rate is low, especially in periods of high tension and with such specific requirements (stockpile reduction, not just limits). Current media signals favor a possible extension, but not a reduction treaty. Considering all these elements, the likelihood of a qualifying, signed, formal agreement in four months is no higher than 15%.",

While verification\u2014especially on-site inspections\u2014remains contested, the extension could simply preserve the current treaty\u2019s limits while punting harder renovations to later. Base rates for arms control deal salvage at the last minute are low in adversarial climates, but not zero: the 2021 extension of New START (albeit under less hostile US-Russia relations) was rapidly enacted just weeks before expiry. China is a non-factor due to persistent rejection of participation.

Inclusion of China is not realistic in this time frame and is ruled out by Beijing. Thus, only a bilateral US\u2013Russia agreement is plausible, most likely as a one-year extension of New START. Overall, the probability is real but modest; 'not impossible, but not likely.' Given how track one diplomatic processes actually function, unless immediate and focused diplomatic action occurs within weeks, the window will likely close. However, both sides have a shared incentive to avoid the total collapse of arms control, and with high-level signaling still positive, I judge the probability of a signed extension at about 25% at this point\u2014higher than the historical baseline for such agreements under high tension but far from likely.",

However, base rates for signing arms control agreements under severe bilateral tension (active conflict, mutual distrust, and inspection breakdown) are lower, even if not zero. Historically, even when one side has suspended participation (Russia), last-minute agreements have been reached, but reductions ('decrease') rather than simple extensions are rare unless accompanied by clear concessions or linkages. It is ambiguous whether a simple extension at the same cap qualifies as a 'decrease' (the question refers to decreasing, but not necessarily below previous levels), but recent expert commentary suggests a signed extension may be treated as meeting the 'mutually agree to decrease' criterion, assuming it is a formal document. Factoring all considerations, including the three-month window and positive signaling, but weighing against the structural and historical obstacles, I estimate the probability at 60%.",

No procedural ratification is required \u2014 only signatures. Arms control, historically, is often subject to brinksmanship, with agreements signed very close to deadlines. Probabilistically, agreement to extend New START is the by far most plausible YES pathway, especially given public political will and the low procedural barrier.

The outstanding risks are last-minute political ruptures, new escalations (especially linked to Ukraine), or a sudden hardening of domestic or bureaucratic resistance in either state.

While trust is low, the fact that both sides see value in maintaining at least a minimal framework (to buy time, show responsibility, and avoid costs) fits rational choice models of arms control as risk management. The fine print means a mere signing (not ratification) suffices. However, actual follow-through could still founder due to last-minute breakdowns or linkage to other unresolved security demands, and the dire state of US-Russia relations, plus the specter of domestic spoilers.

Your reasoning emphasizes positive elite-level signals and precedent for last-minute arms control deals, but it downplays several fundamental obstacles:\n\n1. The extension or signing must occur incredibly quickly, with less than four months remaining, yet there is no reporting of resumed formal negotiations or a genuine rush to legalize an agreement. Arms control history shows that signature\u2014even for minimalist extensions\u2014usually follows at least some technical and legal groundwork already laid, which is not in evidence.\n2. The current public statements from both Trump and Putin, while positive, are not themselves binding commitments and have not yet produced a formal document. The risk of bureaucratic inertia, misunderstandings, or a diplomatic incident (e.g., triggered by Ukraine), particularly at this fraught stage, is high.\n3. Most crucially, the fine print of the question requires an agreement to \"decrease\" stockpiles\u2014not simply extend existing limits. The present negotiation posture centers on maintaining New START caps, not explicitly reducing deployed arsenals. Unless an extension or side agreement includes an actual numerical reduction or discard clause, the technical resolution may default to NO. Your forecast does not fully reckon with this lace of clarity and the possibility that an extension alone would not meet contest resolution criteria.\n\nThus, while your understanding of China is entirely persuasive, the likelihood you ascribe (70%) to a qualifying U.S.-Russia signature does not appropriately weigh the procedural, political, and technical hurdles remaining, as interpreted through the resolution\u2019s precise requirements and historical precedent."

My perspective underscores that the technical criteria for a 'formal treaty'\u2014even for an extension\u2014still require formal negotiation, drafting, and signing at the elite bureaucratic level, which is a much higher procedural bar than expressions of positive intent, especially in an environment where on-site verification is suspended and mutual compliance is eroded by recent behavior (suspension, war, threats). Instances of treaty extensions at the last moment (e.g., New START 2021) were preceded by more robust engagement and less adversarial atmospherics than we see in late 2025. While sunk costs and institutional logic favor extension, the current absence of resumed on-site inspections, extreme time pressure, and lack of evidence of working groups or legal teams in motion all meaningfully decrease the probability a 'YES'-qualifying instrument will be signed in time. Thus, while your institutional logic is strong, I recommend moderating the probability to better reflect the technical hurdles, lack of demonstrated compliance mechanisms, and absence of tangible bureaucratic preparations\u2014critical factors from a verification/compliance expert's perspective."

While you note the practical impossibility of any trilateral or China-engaged scenario, you give limited weight to the actual, observable status of Track One processes: at this moment, the US and Russia have not even initiated a synchronized bureaucratic sprint toward a signed extension; administrative machinery and legal groundwork are not evident in the media or diplomatic readouts. The lack of formal negotiation start is more consequential for treaty signature in bilateral US-Russia Track One diplomacy than in looser, multilateral negotiation forums, where incremental progress or partial consensus can suffice. In Track One, the absence of visible, formal procedures so close to the deadline sharply suppresses the odds relative to cases with well-prepared groundwork. Additionally, while you mention 'positive but still preliminary signaling,' the conversion of signaling to signed instruments is the historical chokepoint, especially in adversarial contexts with ongoing military conflict.

Even amidst high-profile noncooperation, both sides have proven able and willing to salvage existing regimes at the eleventh hour because of sunk costs and the exceptionally high perceived dangers of unconstrained nuclear competition. In this case, the global and domestic incentives against a complete arms control breakdown are acute on both sides, and both Trump and Putin have voiced public commitments specifically to an extension, not merely vague interest. Past last-minute rollovers (e.g., New START 2021, INF pre-suspension overtures) often lacked exhaustive technical preparation until the final weeks, yet still resulted in signed agreements to avert legal or strategic voids. While you are right that procedural inertia and the security dilemma loom, weighing these factors against the tangible institutional pathways and elite signaling justifies a probability above your cautious estimate.

As an IR Security Dilemma specialist, I must stress that mutual signaling, even of the highest tier, does not erase the substantive problem of deep-seated mistrust and the ongoing security dilemma between the US and Russia, magnified by the Ukraine conflict and breakdown of verification mechanisms. You fairly note that no ratification is required and that historical inertia increases the odds under elite consensus, but you underappreciate the bureaucratic friction and adversarial path dependency in late 2025\u2014no working-level talks are reported, and technical inter-agency obstacles remain formidable. Additionally, your reasoning discounts the nontrivial risk of sudden diplomatic breakdown (due to battlefield shocks, domestic politics, or leadership volatility), which remains a key reason so many late-stage arms control efforts stall at the brink. While 'plausible pathway' to signature is undoubted, placing it at 85% seems more a best-case scenario than a balanced forecast: the empirical record of arms control in periods of comparable tension is not so confident, especially when not even a formal negotiation process is visible so close to deadline.

On the other hand, several forecasters (especially those in Rational Choice, Neorealism, and Liberal Institutionalism) make strong cases that base rates for last-minute arms control extensions support a non-trivial probability, given convergent leadership signaling and the minimal requirements for a 'YES' outcome. Synthesizing these insights and balancing the bold risk/reward incentives of the contest, a probability near 50% reflects both the elevated likelihood compared to historic pessimism and the undeniable procedural, technical, and political risks that remain.",

Several forecasters (including myself) emphasize rational incentives for a last-minute US-Russia extension, but institutional inertia and brinkmanship are not guarantees. Importantly, concerns were raised about how 'decrease' is defined in the contest resolution and whether a simple extension (versus a true reduction) would clearly qualify. While others in the group have probabilities in the 60\u201370% range, the consensus effect of detailed critique\u2014especially on the lack of technical prep and persistent public/routine mistrust\u2014warrants a modest step back from strong boldness, acknowledging the material chance that necessary steps will not be completed in time.

            "reasoning_for_revised_probability": "Reviewing the group deliberation, several trends become clear. There is broad consensus that a US\u2013Russia agreement is the only plausible path, with China decisively out. No forecaster credibly contests that a signed, even minimal, bilateral extension is technically feasible and potentially sufficient for contest resolution. Positive elite signaling is higher than in typical breakdown periods, and some structural factors (institutional inertia, mutual incentives, the procedural ease of a minimalist extension) push the probability upward, as highlighted by both neorealist and rational choice perspectives. However, participants with arms control technical backgrounds (treaty negotiation, verification/compliance) emphasize the still-missing bureaucratic/legal groundwork and warn that absence of actual negotiations, unresolved inspection issues, and fraught politics could be decisive. Critiques remind us that public signaling is not a fait accompli; the greatest risk is a last-minute diplomatic, technical, or political impasse, which\u2014while not the base case\u2014is inescapably elevated by the short time window and adversarial context. I also note rigorous debate on whether a simple extension meets the 'decrease' criterion, though the contest seems likely to accept a formal extension. The modal probabilities from the most methodologically rigorous perspectives (deterrence theory, neorealism, rational choice, track one diplomacy, and game theory) cluster at or just above even odds (60-65%); those more skeptical (technical/process, security dilemma) cluster in the 35-45% range. I still see the edge with a pragmatic, minimalist yes\u2014though possibly less than the stronger liberal institutionalist/two level games cases. Taking all opinions into account, especially the pointed warnings from technical arms control specialists, I modestly lower my probability by 2 points to 60%. This reflects slightly heightened awareness of procedural and technical holdups, balanced against strong elite signals and mutual self-interest.",

Notably, critiques from Arms Control Policy (Treaty Negotiation Practice) and Track One Diplomacy align with my view that the probability of a qualifying YES outcome is suppressed by procedural, legal, and diplomatic hurdles\u2014even when public signaling by leaders is positive. Several forecasters urge that past extensions frequently occurred under less hostile conditions, and stress that the actual technical and bureaucratic momentum needed for signature is currently lacking. Moreover, multiple group members point out ambiguity regarding whether a simple extension meets the 'decrease' criterion, since both US and Russian leaders currently discuss maintaining, not reducing, current limits. That said, some defenses of higher probabilities stress the powerful institutional inertia and historical precedent for last-minute deals, which supports the notion that even seemingly stalled arms control can be revived on short notice. On balance, the deliberation pushes only slightly toward a more cautious stance: the main scenario for YES is still a minimalist US-Russia extension, but weak reporting of imminent negotiations or legal draft work, coupled with persistent ambiguity about the 'decrease' requirement, means the probability likely remains below 50%.

Speaking to journalists outside the White House, Trump stated, 'That seems like a good idea,' signaling potential diplomatic thaw amid ongoing tensions. The comment was well received in Moscow, where Kirill Dmitriev, Putin\u2019s economic advisor and close Kremlin figure, said both countries are 'quite open' to reaching an agreement on the extension. Putin had previously criticized the U.S. on October 3, 2025, for delaying a response, asserting that if the U.S. does not need the extension, Russia also does not need it, and emphasizing Russia\u2019s confidence in its nuclear deterrent. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and 700 launchers, and includes mutual inspections. Originally set to expire in February 2026, Russia unilaterally suspended its participation in February 2023 following the start of the war in Ukraine. Moscow has since advocated for future arms agreements to include China, France, and the UK, citing a 'new multipolar order' and the expansion of nuclear arsenals beyond the Cold War axis. In late September, Putin proposed extending New START until February 2026, maintaining the existing numerical limits and stating Russia is prepared to uphold these limits for one year beyond February 5, 2026, provided the U.S. does not take actions that undermine strategic deterrence. Despite prior high-level meetings, such as the August meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska, formal negotiations on the extension have not yet begun.

According to American expert Daryl Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association, Trump's approval effectively amounted to accepting Moscow's initiative. Kimball welcomed the positive response, stating that the organization urges both Republicans and Democrats to support Trump\u2019s decision to maintain reasonable limits on the world\u2019s two largest and most lethal nuclear arsenals. He emphasized that maintaining these constraints for at least one year after the treaty\u2019s expiration would reduce tensions, prevent an expensive arms race, and create diplomatic leverage to curb China\u2019s nuclear buildup. Kimball added that the Kremlin and the White House must now formalize the agreement and immediately instruct their teams to begin negotiations on a new, more comprehensive treaty. Trump previously described the proposal as 'a good idea' during a briefing on the South Lawn of the White House. The START treaty, signed by Russia and the U.S. in 2010, limits the number of deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems.

Kimball emphasized that the Kremlin and the White House must now formalize the arrangement and immediately begin negotiations on a new comprehensive agreement. The New START Treaty, signed in 2010 and effective since February 5, 2011, limits each side to 700 deployed strategic delivery vehicles and 1,550 warheads, with a five-year extension agreed in 2021. Russia suspended its participation on February 21, 2023, demanding that future negotiations include the nuclear arsenals of the UK and France. Putin previously stated on September 22, 2025, that Russia would continue adhering to the treaty\u2019s limits for one year if the US followed suit. Trump, when asked by TASS on Sunday, said Putin\u2019s proposal 'sounds like a good idea.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 08:23 PM\nSource:[TASS](https://tass.com/world/2025437)\n\n**'Good Idea' \u2013 Trump Endorses Putin's Proposal for New START Treaty Extension**\nDonald Trump has expressed support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal to extend the New START nuclear arms control treaty by one year, calling it 'a good idea' during a statement at the White House on October 5, 2025. Putin had previously announced in September 2024 that Russia was willing to uphold the treaty's limits\u2014capping deployed warheads at 1,550 and delivery systems at 800 each\u2014for an additional year beyond the treaty's original expiration date of February 5, 2026. The 2010 agreement also includes mutual inspection provisions, which Russia suspended in 2023 amid escalating tensions over the war in Ukraine.

Putin had previously indicated Russia's willingness to extend the treaty for one year beyond its expiration date of February 5, 2026, if the United States takes similar action. During a meeting of the Russian Security Council, Putin emphasized that the treaty has played a 'positive and important role' in maintaining strategic stability and predictability in offensive nuclear weapons for nearly 15 years. He warned that a complete rejection of the treaty's legacy would be 'a mistaken and short-sighted move' with negative implications for the goals of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The New START treaty, signed on April 8, 2010, and extended for five years in February 2021 without preconditions, requires both parties to limit their strategic arsenals to 700 delivery vehicles, 1,550 warheads, and 800 launchers. Russia suspended its participation in February 2023, citing the United States' 'destruction of the legal basis for arms control and security' due to NATO's military deployment against Russia. However, Russia has consistently stated its intention to comply with the treaty's limits during its active period.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[AlMomento.net](https://almomento.net/ve-es-buena-idea-decision-putin-prorrogar-tratado-sobre-armas/)\n\n**Russia Calls for U.S. Talks on Nuclear Weapons, Urges Future Inclusion of Britain and France - EconoTimes**\nRussia has called for direct U.S.\u2013Russia talks on reducing strategic nuclear weapons, while insisting that Britain and France eventually be included. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday that although the New START treaty is a bilateral agreement, long\u2011term European and global security requires addressing the arsenals of all major powers. He noted that Russia and the United States hold the world\u2019s largest stockpiles, while Britain and France \u2013 never parties to New START \u2013 maintain roughly 250\u2013300 warheads each. Peskov warned that ignoring those European arsenals would undermine long\u2011term security. President Vladimir Putin had earlier proposed that Russia and the U.S. voluntarily maintain the New START limits for one year after its 2026 expiration, provided Washington agreed. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the proposal as 'pretty good,' but said the decision rests with President Donald Trump. Trump has previously expressed interest in expanding arms\u2011control talks to include China. New START, signed in 2010 by Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limits each side to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 700 delivery vehicles. The treaty was extended in 2021 under Joe Biden but suspended by Russia in 2023 amid tensions over the war in Ukraine, though Moscow says it still observes the limits. The future of arms control remains uncertain as Ukraine pushes for harsher sanctions on Moscow and Washington weighs whether to pursue bilateral or expanded talks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[EconoTimes](https://econotimes.com/Russia-Calls-for-US-Talks-on-Nuclear-Weapons-Urges-Future-Inclusion-of-Britain-and-France-1721811)\n\n**Putin Proposes Temporary Extension of Strategic Weapons Reduction Treaty with Trump**\nOn September 22\u202f2025, Russian President Vladimir\u202fPutin announced at a Security Council meeting that he is ready to extend the New\u202fSTART treaty for an additional year, but only if U.S. President Donald\u202fTrump agrees to do the same (Reuters). The New\u202fSTART, signed in 2010 and effective from 2011, is a bilateral agreement that limits deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550 and delivery vehicles to 800, and contains 16 articles. The treaty originally ran until February\u202f5\u202f2026, after a five\u2011year extension.

He framed the move as being in the 'interests of global non\u2011proliferation' and to 'restore dialogue with Washington about a future treaty', according to Reuters. The New\u202fSTART follows the original START\u202fI signed in 1991 between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which was in force from 1994 to 2009; attempts to negotiate START\u202fII and III failed. The proposed one\u2011year extension would keep the treaty in force until February\u202f5\u202f2027, provided the U.S. reciprocates.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 07:28 PM\nSource:[Polska Agencja Prasowa](https://www.pap.pl/ua/ukrainian/news/putin-zaproponuvav-trampu-timchasove-prodovzhennya-dogovoru-pro-skorochennya)\n\n**Trump Wants China to Join Nuclear Reduction Talks, Chinese Foreign Ministry Says Unreasonable and Unrealistic**\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said that the United States and Russia are discussing nuclear reduction and that China should be invited to join the talks.

'O presidente dos Estados Unidos disse j\u00e1 ter tratado do tema com Vladimir Putin e afirmou acreditar que Xi Jinping aceitar\u00e1 se engajar nas conversas,' the piece notes. Trump also hinted at a meeting with North Korean leader Kim\u202fJong\u202fUn. The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits the strategic arsenals of the United States and Russia.

Moscow has warned that renewal is unlikely, and previous attempts to involve China failed because Beijing claims its nuclear stockpile is far smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia. In 2024, the Biden administration sought to open a similar dialogue but paused it after China suspended meetings in protest of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.

    "summary": "Forecasters generally agree that the window for a formal, mutually signed agreement to decrease nuclear stockpiles between at least two of the US, Russia, or China is narrowing, with less than four months until the February 2026 deadline. Across all perspectives, several consistent themes emerge: \n\n1. Virtually all experts dismiss a US-China or Russia-China agreement as highly implausible. China has categorically refused to participate in any such deal due to its smaller arsenal and strategic doctrine, and recent public statements from Beijing reinforce this position.\n\n2. The only realistic pathway is a bilateral US-Russia agreement, most likely as a one-year extension of the New START treaty or a similar stopgap. Public statements and mutual signaling from both Trump and Putin are noted as positive, with both leaders indicating openness to maintaining or extending limits. This creates a unique, if narrow, window of opportunity for a minimal extension or reduction agreement.\n\n3. That said, almost all experts highlight substantial practical and political hurdles to turning this rhetoric into a signed treaty. The time left is very short. There have been no formal resumption of negotiations, mutual trust is very low (especially given the ongoing Ukraine war), inspections remain suspended, and bureaucratic as well as domestic obstacles persist (particularly in the US). The distinction between public signaling and actual signature is repeatedly emphasized: the question requires a formal signed document, not just intent or positive media statements.\n\n4. Base rates and historical precedent suggest last-minute extensions are possible, especially when both sides face deadline pressure and have mutual incentives to avert an uncontrolled arms race. Several experts reference the 2021 New START extension as an example. However, progress in arms control under current conditions of strained relations is historically rare, especially if the agreement must constitute an actual 'decrease' rather than maintenance of status quo caps.\n\n5. Individual probability estimates vary widely, with 'No' probabilities ranging from 15% to 45% (most pessimism from arms control and verification specialists), middling forecasts in the 40-60% range from diplomacy, game theory, and security dilemma perspectives, and more optimistic assessments (up to 73-85%) from rational choice, liberal institutionalist, and two-level games viewpoints, who argue that the low procedural barrier (signing, not ratification), shared incentives, and public alignment between leaders make a minimalist extension quite likely.\n\n6. All experts note the possibility of last-minute breakdowns\u2014from renewed disputes over verification, linkage to other issues (such as the Ukraine war), or domestic opposition\u2014but emphasize that only a formal, signed bilateral US-Russia extension (not mere continuation in practice or offhand political remarks) will resolve the question as YES. \n\n7. In summary: There is broad consensus that a US-Russia agreement is plausible, with odds above historic pessimism due to unusually positive, synchronized elite signaling and the limited extension needed for positive resolution. However, with substantial obstacles remaining and the question\u2019s fine print requiring an actual signed instrument to decrease stockpiles, most forecasts cluster around a moderate probability (40-70%), with outliers slightly lower or higher based on interpretation of incentives, historical inertia, and strategic calculations. A trilateral agreement or Chinese participation is almost universally ruled out as negligible.",
