The original question opened on 2023-07-21 19:16:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17917). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nIn his book [*Extraterrestrial*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/astronomer-avi-loeb-says-aliens-have-visited-and-hes-not-kidding1/), Harvard astrophysicist [Avi Loeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Loeb) suggests that a 2017 interstellar object known as ['Oumuamua](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/oumuamua/in-depth/) is [\"interstellar technology built by aliens\"](https://www.independent.co.uk/space/avi-loeb-harvard-university-ufos-b2039269.html).\n\nInspired by partially by \u2018Oumuamua, Loeb founded [The Galileo Project](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/) in 2021 to \"[systematically search for extraterrestrial intelligence or extraterrestrial technology on and near Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Galileo_Project).\" Galileo planned and [secured funding for](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/message-in-an-interstellar-bottle-c393ea526e9f) an [expedition](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/summary-of-the-successful-interstellar-expedition-61ff4467070d) to recover portions of an object known as [CNEOS 2014-01-08](https://www.space.com/2014-meteor-first-interstellar-visitor-oumuamua), commonly called [Interstellar Meteor 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNEOS_2014-01-08) (IM1), which crashed of the coast of Papua New Guinea on January 8th, 2014. \n\nIM1 became a target of interest for The Gallileo Project when Loeb and a student, [Amir Siraj](https://scholar.harvard.edu/siraj/home), submitted a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07224) arguing\u2014citing a US Department of Defense [memo](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/DoD.pdf)\u2014that the object originated outside the solar system.\n\n> we identify the \u223c0.45m meteor detected at 2014-01-08 17:05:34 UTC as originating from an unbound hyperbolic orbit with 99.999\\% confidence. The U.S. Department of Defense has since verified that \"the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory.\"\n\nIf Loeb and Siraj are correct, then IM1 is the first [interstellar object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_object) scientifically known to impact the earth. Other scientists have [disputed](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/acm2023/pdf/2226.pdf) their conclusions.\n\n\nBased on IM1's observed toughness, Loeb believes that not only may the object be interstellar, but that it could be [alien technology](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230626-the-underwater-search-for-an-alien-object). To [quote Loeb](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/message-in-an-interstellar-bottle-c393ea526e9f):\n\n> There are two general possibilities. Either IM1 is of new natural origin, or it is artificial, produced by an extraterrestrial technological civilization. Regarding the first possibility, X-ray imaging of the Vela supernova remnant [revealed](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Natur.373..590S/abstract) bow shocks from bullets flying out of the explosion site, a discovery [I attempted to explain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9405071.pdf) three decades ago. It is possible that IM1 was a small bullet tougher than conventional iron meteorites, shot out of an exploding star. But it is also possible that it was a spacecraft, a billion-year old equivalent of our [interstellar probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_probe). Just [imagine](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/the-new-horizons-meteor-a62a3bb177b7) a spacecraft like Voyager 1 & 2, Pioneer 10 & 11 or New Horizons, crashing onto a habitable exo-planet and burning up in its atmosphere. The exo-scientists on this exo-planet would regard the resulting exo-meteor as space trash. However, if they are curious enough to examine the composition of its fragments, they would realize that it was artificial in origin.\n\nUsing a [massive magnetic sled](https://www.livescience.com/interstellar-asteroid-fishing-expedition) to scrape the seabed, Loeb's expedition found [50 spherules](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/avi-loeb-interstellar-object-aliens-b2369534.html) which Loeb believes are portions of IM1. Loeb says these spherules are now being [analyzed](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/starting-the-analysis-of-spherules-from-the-interstellar-expedition-2bc608d2d7ce) by \"three laboratories in UC Berkeley, Harvard and the Bruker Corporation in Germany.\" Loeb is providing regular updates on his [blog](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/starting-the-analysis-of-spherules-from-the-interstellar-expedition-2bc608d2d7ce).\n\n> The fundamental question we will address is whether the elements and radioactive isotopes in the spherules have different abundances than solar system materials. If so, we would also check for any anomalies that might indicate a technological origin. For example, the melted material of semiconductors would include rare elements at a much higher abundance than found in nature.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17917,\"question_id\":17917}}`",

While officially classified as a comet, Harvard University expert Avi Loeb, director of the Galileo Project, argues it is not a natural comet but a functional extraterrestrial spacecraft with non-human technology. Loeb claims the object is 'exceptionally large' for a typical icy comet and exhibits unusual speed, trajectory, and color, suggesting artificial origin. He posits that its path avoids close Earth approach during lunar alignment in late October to evade human monitoring. On October 29, 2025, as the object nears the Sun, it may either disintegrate like a comet or reveal itself as a technological craft. Loeb estimates a 30% to 40% chance the object is not entirely natural, possibly acting as a 'Trojan horse'\u2014a technological probe disguised as a comet. If not destroyed by solar heat, the object could deploy a fleet of 'mini probes' to study multiple celestial bodies simultaneously, similar to a technological mothership. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will monitor the object in November and December 2025, and ground-based observatories may verify the release of mini probes, supporting Loeb\u2019s hypothesis. According to Loeb, solar radiation heats a comet\u2019s icy core, causing volatile ices like carbon dioxide and water to sublimate into gas, potentially fracturing the comet under thermal stress.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[ViveUSA.mx](https://www.viveusa.mx/destinos/experto-de-harvard-predice-que-el-3iatlas-se-revelara-como-una-nave-extraterrestre-y-liberara-mini-sondas/)\n\n**SETI Scientist Tries To Debunk Harvard Astrophysicist's Claims Comet May Be An Alien Spacecraft**\nInterstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked debate over whether it could be an alien spacecraft, primarily due to claims by Avi Loeb, former chairman of Harvard's Department of Astronomy and head of the Galileo Project. Loeb, who previously suggested that 1I/'Oumuamua might be extraterrestrial, stated in July 2025 that 3I/ATLAS may be traveling to avoid Earth-based observation and noted seven anomalies in its behavior, assigning a 30\u201340% likelihood that it has a non-natural origin, including the possibility of a 'Trojan Horse' scenario. In response, Eahsanul Haque, a SETI Institute scientist and senior lecturer at Universiti Teknologi Petronas, published a paper arguing that the comet\u2019s hyperbolic trajectory (eccentricity ~6.1), high speed (~58 km/s), and low probability of close encounters with planets (~0.005%) are consistent with gravitational ejection from another star system, similar to 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Tom Statler, NASA\u2019s lead scientist for solar system small bodies, emphasized that 3I/ATLAS 'looks like a comet. It does comet things' and behaves like known comets, calling the evidence 'overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body.' Despite this, Loeb warned that if his hypothesis were correct, the consequences could be 'dire for humanity' and might necessitate defensive measures, though they 'might prove futile.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 02:09 PM\nSource:[BroBible](https://brobible.com/culture/article/seti-scientist-astrophysicist-comet-alien-spacecraft/)\n\n**Could 3I/ATLAS Be Artificial?

Astronomer Avi Leob from Harvard University suggests there is a '30 to 40 percent chance' that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin, raising speculation about artificial intelligence. Ole J. Knudsen, former director of the Steno Museum Planetarium in Aarhus, acknowledges Leob as a respected scientist with credible arguments but emphasizes the extremely low probability of extraterrestrial origin. He notes that 3I/ATLAS is among the first interstellar objects ever observed from outside our solar system, making it highly unlikely that one of them would be artificial. The object exhibited unusual behavior by accelerating as it approached the Sun\u2014unlike natural bodies, which typically slow due to gravitational forces. This phenomenon mirrors that of 'Oumuamua in 2017, which also triggered debate over its origin. 3I/ATLAS is now the third confirmed interstellar object, and Knudsen highlights that recent technological advances in telescopes and monitoring systems over the past five to ten years have made such discoveries possible. He predicts that many more such objects will be detected in the future due to improved technology.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:25 PM\nSource:[nyheder.tv2.dk](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2025-10-14-fartmonster-fra-det-ydre-rum-vaekker-debat-blandt-forskere)\n\n**A 'Trojan Horse' from Outer Space: What We Know About the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS**\nThe interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, currently traversing the Solar System, is the focus of a major scientific debate set to culminate on October 29, 2025, when it will approach the Sun.

This claim is based on the object's unusual shape, high velocity, and the detection of self-generated light\u2014unlike reflected sunlight\u2014suggesting an active energy source. Loeb argues there is no evidence of a bright cometary tail in the expected direction, which contradicts the typical behavior of comets. He identifies two possible explanations: a rare fragment from a nearby supernova rich in radioactive material, or a spacecraft utilizing nuclear energy, with dust emissions possibly originating from surface debris accumulated during interstellar travel. Loeb considers the supernova fragment hypothesis highly unlikely and believes the data better supports the spacecraft interpretation. He has urged NASA to use the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\u2019s HiRISE camera during the first week of October 2025, when 3I/ATLAS will pass closest to Mars, and received a favorable response. While Loeb is known for controversial claims, he remains a respected figure in astronomy.

While officially classified as a comet, Harvard University expert Avi Loeb, director of the Galileo Project, argues it is not a natural comet but a functional extraterrestrial spacecraft with non-human technology. Loeb claims the object is 'exceptionally large' for a typical icy comet and exhibits unusual speed, trajectory, and color, suggesting artificial origin. He posits that its path avoids close Earth approach during lunar alignment in late October to evade human monitoring. On October 29, 2025, as the object nears the Sun, it may either disintegrate like a comet or reveal itself as a technological craft. Loeb estimates a 30% to 40% chance the object is not entirely natural, possibly acting as a 'Trojan horse'\u2014a technological probe disguised as a comet. If not destroyed by solar heat, the object could deploy a fleet of 'mini probes' to study multiple celestial bodies simultaneously, similar to a technological mothership. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will monitor the object in November and December 2025, and ground-based observatories may verify the release of mini probes, supporting Loeb\u2019s hypothesis. According to Loeb, solar radiation heats a comet\u2019s icy core, causing volatile ices like carbon dioxide and water to sublimate into gas, potentially fracturing the comet under thermal stress.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[ViveUSA.mx](https://www.viveusa.mx/destinos/experto-de-harvard-predice-que-el-3iatlas-se-revelara-como-una-nave-extraterrestre-y-liberara-mini-sondas/)\n\n**Conspiracy in Science: Does NASA Conceal Information About the Artificial Origin of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS?**\nThe lack of official updates on the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has reignited a conspiracy theory popularized by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. Initially detected as a mysterious comet, 3I/ATLAS has become the focus of speculation due to the absence of detailed information and the silence from prominent astronomers. While early observations reported unusual findings\u2014such as atomic nickel, cyanogen, and an atypical activation rate\u2014news about its trajectory and composition has diminished over time. This information vacuum has fueled claims that agencies like NASA or ESA may be concealing data about the object\u2019s true nature. Avi Loeb, known for his controversial theories about the first interstellar object 'Oumuamua, has suggested that 3I/ATLAS might not be a natural comet but rather an artificial or extraterrestrial technological probe, based on alleged anomalies. However, the vast majority of the scientific community maintains that 3I/ATLAS is a natural interstellar comet functioning as a 'time capsule' from the early Milky Way. The persistence of conspiracy theories underscores the enduring mystery surrounding this enigmatic cosmic visitor.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 05:42 PM\nSource:[FayerWayer](https://www.fayerwayer.com/espacio/2025/10/13/conspiracion-en-la-ciencia-oculta-la-nasa-informacion-sobre-el-origen-artificial-del-objeto-interestelar-3iatlas/)\n\n**SETI Scientist Tries To Debunk Harvard Astrophysicist's Claims Comet May Be An Alien Spacecraft**\nInterstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked debate over whether it could be an alien spacecraft, primarily due to claims by Avi Loeb, former chairman of Harvard's Department of Astronomy and head of the Galileo Project. Loeb, who previously suggested that 1I/'Oumuamua might be extraterrestrial, stated in July 2025 that 3I/ATLAS may be traveling to avoid Earth-based observation and noted seven anomalies in its behavior, assigning a 30\u201340% likelihood that it has a non-natural origin, including the possibility of a 'Trojan Horse' scenario. In response, Eahsanul Haque, a SETI Institute scientist and senior lecturer at Universiti Teknologi Petronas, published a paper arguing that the comet\u2019s hyperbolic trajectory (eccentricity ~6.1), high speed (~58 km/s), and low probability of close encounters with planets (~0.005%) are consistent with gravitational ejection from another star system, similar to 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Tom Statler, NASA\u2019s lead scientist for solar system small bodies, emphasized that 3I/ATLAS 'looks like a comet. It does comet things' and behaves like known comets, calling the evidence 'overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body.' Despite this, Loeb warned that if his hypothesis were correct, the consequences could be 'dire for humanity' and might necessitate defensive measures, though they 'might prove futile.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 02:09 PM\nSource:[BroBible](https://brobible.com/culture/article/seti-scientist-astrophysicist-comet-alien-spacecraft/)\n\n**3I/ATLAS Is Simply a Comet, Sensational Theories Disproven**\nThe interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system, has been the subject of sensational and speculative claims suggesting it could be an extraterrestrial probe sent to observe or attack Earth. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb estimated a 30-40% chance the object is non-natural, citing complex maneuvers and 'anomalous' orbital characteristics. However, the scientific community maintains there is no evidence to support these claims. AKM Eahsanul Haque, a SETI researcher, published an analysis showing that 3I/ATLAS's trajectory, though rare, falls within the expected range for a natural interstellar object. Its orbit and proximity to the ecliptic plane are not anomalies requiring extraterrestrial explanations. Spectroscopic and behavioral observations confirm the object behaves like a comet: it emits gas and dust, follows known gravitational laws, and exhibits properties consistent with cometary nuclei. NASA's Tom Statler stated clearly: 'It behaves like a comet. The evidence clearly indicates a natural body, not an alien probe.' In conclusion, 3I/ATLAS is a natural object originating from another region of the galaxy\u2014possibly a fragment from an extrasolar sedimentary basin\u2014worthy of scientific study but not evidence of extraterrestrial technology. Sensational speculation must not overshadow empirical data: our third interstellar visitor remains, simply, a comet.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[MeteoWeb](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2025/10/3i-atlas-e-semplicemente-una-cometa-smentite-ipotesi-fantasiose/1001848706/)\n\n**Avi Loeb Challenges Scientific Community: 'I Search for Intelligence in Space Because I Often Don\u2019t Find It on Earth'**\nAvi Loeb, a physicist at Harvard University and director of the Galileo Project, continues to challenge the scientific community by advocating for the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). He argues that phenomena such as the interstellar object 'Oumuamua'\u2014which passed near Earth in 2017\u2014may not be natural and could be evidence of extraterrestrial technology. Loeb's controversial theory, suggesting 'Oumuamua' might be an alien spacecraft, was met with skepticism by the scientific community, leading to public division between supporters and critics. Despite NASA forming a dedicated UAP study team in 2021, the agency maintains a cautious stance, stating there is 'no clear evidence' of extraterrestrial origins. Loeb has criticized NASA and the scientific establishment, declaring, 'I search for intelligence in space because I often don\u2019t find it on Earth,' positioning himself as a vocal critic of mainstream scientific institutions. His Galileo Project remains active, promoting open-minded exploration of unexplained phenomena as a way to expand human understanding of the universe.

Loeb proposes sending a Morse code message to 3I/ATLAS to test his theory, saying 'Hello, welcome to our neighborhood. Peace!' 'It is well known to any interstellar traveler that there are plenty of icy rocks in planetary systems,' Loeb wrote.

The search for life in space is moving from theory to practice. The second part of the series 'How we are trying to answer the question: 'Are we alone in the universe?' reveals how scientists, private initiatives, and government agencies are investigating what was previously considered science fiction: traces of extraterrestrial technology, oceans beneath the icy crusts of distant moons, and unexplained objects in the sky. The Galileo Project. While government agencies such as NASA and the Pentagon are increasingly opening up space for analysis of unidentified phenomena, one of the most daring and controversial attempts comes from the academic community, but outside institutional funding. Astro physicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University founded the Galileo Project, a privately funded scientific program that deals with the search for traces of extraterrestrial technology near Earth, including the atmosphere, orbit, and ocean floor. The project uses high-resolution optics, spectroscopy, radar, magnetic detectors, and advanced data processing algorithms in real-time. Systems have already been set up at several locations in the US, and the goal is to create a global network for continuous monitoring of anomalous objects that do not belong to known civil, military, or natural classes. One of the most well-known cases being investigated by the Galileo Project is the interstellar object IM1, which entered the Earth's atmosphere in 2014 at hypervelocity speed. Based on data from the US Department of Defense, the object was classified as the first confirmed interstellar meteorite. Loeb organized an expedition to the coast of Papua New Guinea in 2023, where metal microspheres of 0.1 to 1 mm in size were found. Analysis of the composition showed high concentrations of beryllium, lanthanum, and uranium, which was significantly different from the typical composition of known meteorites. Loeb proposed in a scientific paper that such a composition could indicate artificial origin, but this claim was met with harsh criticism in the community, primarily due to the interpretation of data and assumptions about sampling.\nOriginal language: hr\nPublish date: August 17, 2025 03:31 AM\nSource:[qoshe.com](https://qoshe.com/ve-ernji-list/ivan-petri-evi-/neidentificirane-zra-ne-pojave-prvi-put-u-povijesti-dobivaju-ozbiljan-znanstveni-kontekst/184539085)\n\n**The Galileo Project: A Scientific Search for Extraterrestrial Technology**\nAvi Loeb, an astrophysicist from Harvard, believes that the possibility of other technologically advanced civilizations cannot be ignored and that the only way to approach this question is with data, dedicated instruments, and a prejudice-free perspective. He leads the Galileo Project, an initiative that aims to conduct the first systematic, empirical, and transparent search for evidence of extraterrestrial technology beyond and at the limits of our solar system. The project uses artificial intelligence to filter and process large volumes of data to identify patterns that do not correspond to known atmospheric phenomena, satellites, or aircraft. Loeb and his team are studying objects such as 'Oumuamua, a mysterious interstellar object detected in 2017, and the meteorite CNEOS 2014-01-08, which they believe could have a non-terrestrial technological origin. The project is not limited to deep space, but also searches for possible artifacts in Earth's orbit that could be remnants of non-human technology. Loeb emphasizes that the answer may not be in intentional messages, but in physical objects that are already here, but have not been noticed because we have not known or wanted to look.

The paper proposes that the object, 3I/ATLAS, may be a technological spacecraft that could surprise us with a sudden attack. The researchers point out that the object's orbit makes it easy for a smart spacecraft to approach Earth undetected, and that when it approaches the sun in late November, it will disappear from our view, allowing it to perform a high-speed, secret maneuver to slow down and remain in the solar system in preparation for a surprise attack. The scientists note that 3I/ATLAS has an unusual orbit that brings it very close to planets like Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, which is unlikely to happen by chance, with a probability of less than 0.005%. Avi Loeb, one of the authors of the paper, is a prominent astrophysicist at Harvard University known for his bold research and outspoken views on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

Experts note that the peer review process is especially slow and conservative for paradigm-shifting discoveries, and that, as of October 2025, no multi-laboratory, peer-reviewed systematic review has been published or even been publicly hinted as forthcoming.\n\nHistorical base rates for similar extraordinary claims (alien technology, technosignatures, non-terrestrial artifacts) are zero, and all prior anomalies have ultimately been attributed to natural causes or dismissed due to insufficient evidence. While there is acknowledgment that the Galileo Project is better positioned than most to attempt such a discovery, and that publicity could modestly increase the chance of rapid review or breakthrough, this is overwhelmingly outweighed by the timelines involved, the compound evidence standard, and strongly entrenched scientific skepticism.\n\nThe experts agree that scenarios for a 'No' outcome are straightforward: analyses continue, perhaps with intriguing or ambiguous results, but natural explanations or uncertainty prevail, and no peer-reviewed publication achieves the required level of certainty before the deadline.
