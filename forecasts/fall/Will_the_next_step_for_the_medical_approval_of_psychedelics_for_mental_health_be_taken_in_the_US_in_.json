No evidence exists of an imminent NDA/EUA filing for other agents (e.g. no public Phase 3 results for psilocybin in the US on a timeline compatible with 2025 submission). However, fast-moving political impulses, especially under a potentially new administration eager for a public health 'win' or symbolic move, could push for DEA rescheduling by year end 2025, especially as international examples mount and states increase pressure (Oregon, Colorado models). In policy, filings (i.e. NDA/EUA/DEA rescheduling proposals) can be symbolic moves to mark political progress even if the scientific package is debated.\n\nOn balance, while scientific base rates are low, the political and administrative factors are together strong enough to raise the probability of at least one qualifying filing or rescheduling action before January 2026.

The time window is tight, but\u2014given the lowered bar for Yes (filing, not acceptancee/approval)\u2014it is plausible that at least one actor will seize the political moment to file an NDA/EUA for a psychedelic or that political influence will induce DEA rescheduling.

With public political direction to agencies to accelerate and symbolic moves likely (as seen, for instance, with cannabis rescheduling), the traditional anchor to scientific or phase completion is less relevant. Additionally, there is now significant pressure on agencies and industry to seize the moment, which historically leads to last-minute filings when institutional windows are perceived to be closing or public advocacy peaks. Your 55% probability reasonably exceeds strict historical base rates, but may be unduly anchored by trial history benchmarks and less so by the new risk calculus for sponsors and agencies incentivized to file 'placeholder' NDAs/EUAs or pursue a rapid rescheduling, even if success is unlikely.

Political capital invested by high-profile leaders, the explicit FDA signals about expedited reviews, and the incentive for both agencies and sponsors to show progress before year-end markedly reduce the predictive power of historic timelines and standard clinical trial-to-filing lags. While you rightly note almost no direct evidence for imminent NDA/EUA filings, the tail risk of a rapid, even largely symbolic, action is vastly higher in this unique environment. Thus, while your conservative probability (18%) reflects classic base rates, it fails to sufficiently account for the extraordinarily permissive resolution criteria and the unprecedented political and regulatory optics, both of which justify a much higher, perhaps 2-3x, probability of a qualifying step before January 2026."

Notably, there remains a significant absence of any public signals from major sponsors or the FDA that an actual NDA/EUA filing for a psychedelic compound is forthcoming within the 2025 window; candidates widely cited are largely still in pivotal trial progress or addressing regulatory feedback.

You correctly highlight that while the current political and advocacy momentum has shifted, entrenched regulatory inertia, agency risk-aversion after a high-profile FDA rejection, and the lack of overt signals from major sponsors or agencies regarding imminent filings all make a purely probability-driven, high bet questionable. The cannabis analogy is instructive but importantly distinct: cannabis benefited from a unique multi-decade, state-driven push, while psychedelics for mental health face more nascent and fragmented support in both Congress and the states, and pivotal trial data/candidate readiness remain low. The recognition that policy 'hype cycles' do not always translate to concrete action within a one-quarter window is critical to realistic forecasting. Your more tempered probability, focused on historical process inertia and risk management by both sponsors and agencies, is a much-needed corrective to forecasts that rely too heavily on short-term political optics. This approach is especially valid in the face of as-yet unmaterialized public filings or clear regulatory guidance toward imminent NDA/EUA or DEA scheduling moves."

However, from my perspective on the detailed FDA/DEA processes, I believe your 65% probability may slightly overstate the likelihood that a federal agency actually executes a qualifying move within the remaining weeks of 2025. While the administration's shift and agency rhetoric lower traditional procedural barriers, direct evidence of imminent action such as a published proposed rule, an open comment period, a publicized application submission, or an agency docket entry has not materialized in the news flow since October. Even late-breaking moves from the DEA or FDA usually have some warning via Federal Register notices or media leaks, and so far the clearest signals pertain to reviewing ongoing science and accelerating future approvals, not a concrete, currently unfolding rescheduling or NDA/EUA filing. Sponsors and agencies may remain wary of moving precipitously after the FDA\u2019s recent high-profile rejection, especially without new clinical milestones. Thus, while your outlook is entirely justifiable as a tail-risk, I would assign somewhat more weight to the absence of a public 'pipeline' event and the short runway until year's end, suggesting the probability may be better calibrated slightly below even odds rather than solidly above."

You correctly emphasize the risk of under-valuing political/administrative tailwinds in an environment primed for regulatory symbolism\u2014especially since question resolution hinges only on a filing or rescheduling, not a full approval. As you note, it\u2019s essential to recognize that, in American regulatory history, politically salient 'firsts' or symbolic submissions sometimes do occur rapidly when there\u2019s executive pressure to deliver a visible win or respond to advocacy surges (as occurred, for example, with certain drugs under HIV-accelerated approvals in the 1990s, or the 2023 DEA cannabis rescheduling announcement). The risk calculus for sponsors and agencies changes materially in such an environment, sometimes overriding traditional clinical cadence. By foregrounding the distinction between scientific readiness and political or reputational incentives to file\u2014even without robust phase 3 data\u2014you and 'PharmacologyDrugDevelopmentPipeline' credibly justify a probability in the 55-65% range.

The breadth of arguments reinforces the notion that, in the current political environment and given the extremely low bar for a Yes (filing or policy action, not approval), the procedural hurdle could be cleared more readily through non-traditional channels. While there is no concrete evidence of an imminent NDA/EUA filing, strong signals from agencies and the heightened incentive for policymakers to deliver a 'win' in this field increase the likelihood of some action, even as a placeholder or as a policy gesture. My initial probability was already moderately high, but upon further group review, the tail risk of an expedited or symbolic move appears even greater\u2014especially in late December, given the history of policy actions made right before year-end deadlines.

Several forecasters critique the reliance on classical clinical trial timelines, noting that the definition for resolution is so permissive that a purely symbolic or hurried filing (even late in December) suffices. The most compelling arguments are that 'extraordinary' political/policy moments can induce agencies or sponsors to file\u2014despite really limited clinical readiness.

The group leans more optimistic, especially regarding a symbolic or last-minute action, and I accept the probability of a surprise filing is somewhat higher than strict process timelines suggest.

The historical base rates are properly adjusted upward in light of recent events: explicit HHS/FDA signals, ongoing pipeline activity (e.g., Arcadia's IND for non-racemic MDMA), and at least moderately increased institutional willingness.

In practice, combination of the permissive criteria and ongoing political/policy volatility raises the probability meaningfully above my original estimate. Comparing to peers' consensus (which clustered between 38 and 65%), I now see that my original estimate was overly conservative relative to the real-world potential for a late-breaking, symbolic, or pressure-induced filing.

(NASDAQ:JAGX), through its family company Napo Pharmaceuticals, completed a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 2, 2025, to seek guidance on advancing its clinical development program for crofelemer powder for oral solution in treating microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), a rare pediatric disorder. The ongoing investigator-initiated proof-of-concept trial in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) demonstrated a 37% reduction in total parenteral support (PS), including a 30% reduction in total parenteral nutrition (TPN), following reinitiation of crofelemer dosing after a 12-week drug cessation period\u2014exceeding the previously reported 27% PS reduction at 12 weeks. The FDA meeting was attended by members of Napo\u2019s Scientific Advisory Board, including the principal investigator of the UAE trial. Pravin Chaturvedi, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board, stated that the FDA discussion was collaborative and indicated potential pathways to support approval, especially if the study is amended and deemed adequately controlled. Lisa Conte, CEO of Jaguar Health, emphasized gratitude for the FDA\u2019s regulatory support and noted that orphan drug designations have been granted by both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The company plans to pursue regulatory discussions in the EU and Middle East/North Africa (MENA) regions to expand access globally. An abstract detailing partial results from the UAE trial has been accepted for presentation at the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Annual Meeting, November 5\u20138, 2025, in Chicago. Additionally, Jaguar is supporting two expanded access programs in the U.S. under FDA authorization to treat pediatric MVID patients with intestinal failure. MVID affects an estimated 100\u2013200 patients worldwide and currently has no approved treatments, with a lethal natural history and significant comorbidities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[Newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/news/jaguar-health-completes-meeting-with-fda-for-advice-on-development-pathways-to)\n\n**Cellectar Biosciences Announces European Medicines Agency (EMA) Confirms Eligibility to File for Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) for Iopofosine I 131 as a Treatment for Refractory (post-BTKi) Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) | Taiwan News | Oct. 6, 2025 19:00**\nCellectar Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLRB) announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) has confirmed eligibility to file a Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) application for iopofosine I 131 as a treatment for refractory (post-BTKi) Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). The CMA submission is expected in early 2026, with potential European approval and commercial launch in 2027 across 30 EMA member countries. Iopofosine I 131, a first-in-class phospholipid ether-based radioconjugate monotherapy, has received PRIME designation from the EMA for WM patients with at least two prior lines of therapy. The CLOVER WaM Phase 2 study demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 83.6% and a major response rate (MRR) of 58.2% (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.67), with data presented at the 66th Annual American Society of Hematology Conference in December 2024. The SAWP advised that the proposed patient population\u2014post-BTKi refractory patients\u2014meets eligibility criteria for CMA, though it did not assess the sufficiency of safety and efficacy data. The U.S. FDA has granted iopofosine I 131 Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug Designations. Cellectar plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway once a confirmatory trial is underway, though this depends on securing additional funding.

Clinical trials in Spain are in Phase 3 for psilocybin and Phase 2 for 5-MeO-DMT, with specialists predicting regulatory approval by the Ministry of Health 'no earlier than two years' from now. According to Eduard Vieta, head of psychiatry at Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona, psychedelics produce rapid, significant improvements in depression, with some patients achieving full remission after just one or two doses\u2014up to 87.5% in Phase 3 trials with 25 mg of psilocybin. These treatments are administered in hospitals under strict medical supervision. Maria Due\u00f1as from Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u confirmed the significant antidepressant effects of psilocybin in clinical trials. Other psychedelics like LSD and ayahuasca also show efficacy and safety. While no psychedelics are yet approved for prescription, experts believe they will bring a 'radical change' in depression treatment. The future of depression care is moving toward personalized medicine, integrating biological diagnosis, pharmacogenetics, and targeted therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Specialists like V\u00edctor P\u00e9rez and Maria Portella emphasize the importance of individualized, biologically informed treatment. Claudi Camps, director of Mental Health and Addictions in Girona, stresses the need for a holistic approach, recognizing that depression arises from a combination of biological vulnerability, trauma, poverty, and psychosocial stressors. He notes that unresolved childhood trauma can resurface in adulthood, exacerbating depression\u2014highlighting the importance of revisiting past experiences in therapy. Despite progress, chronic and treatment-resistant cases remain challenging, with relapses common after one to two years, though psychedelics and deep brain stimulation are improving outcomes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/ser-feliz/20251006/hospitales-validan-tratar-depresion-cronica-121660944)\n\n**Jaguar Health Completes Meeting with FDA for Advice on Development Pathways to Advance Ongoing Crofelemer Trial for Potential Approval for Treatment of Pediatric Indication Microvillus Inclusion Disea**\nJaguar Health, Inc.

This growth is driven by advancements in precision medicine, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies, including FDA-approved agents such as FLT3 inhibitors (midostaurin, gilteritinib), IDH inhibitors (ivosidenib, enasidenib), BCL-2 inhibitors (venetoclax), and antibody-drug conjugates (gemtuzumab ozogamicin). These innovations have significantly improved survival rates\u2014e.g., chemotherapy plus midostaurin increased median overall survival in FLT3-mutated AML from 25.6 to 74.7 months. Combination regimens, such as venetoclax with hypomethylating agents, have achieved complete remission rates exceeding 70%. North America leads with a 38.2% market share due to high incidence rates, advanced healthcare infrastructure, and accelerated FDA approvals, while Europe holds 25.6% and is driven by an aging population and strong clinical research networks. Key challenges include disease heterogeneity, delayed diagnosis, and molecular testing delays that hinder personalized treatment. Emerging opportunities include CAR T-cell therapies, novel combinations (e.g., venetoclax with STING agonists), and targeted treatments for high-risk or refractory AML. Recent developments include Servier India\u2019s launch of ivosidenib (Tibsovo\u00ae) in June 2025, Pfizer\u2019s FDA label update for TALZENNA\u00ae in November 2024, Lin BioScience\u2019s FDA Fast Track Designation for LBS 007 in November 2024, and Actinium\u2019s positive Phase 3 SIERRA study results for Iomab-B in April 2024.

Clinical trials in Spain are in Phase 3 for psilocybin and Phase 2 for 5-MeO-DMT, with specialists predicting regulatory approval by the Ministry of Health 'no earlier than two years' from now. According to Eduard Vieta, head of psychiatry at Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona, psychedelics produce rapid, significant improvements in depression, with some patients achieving full remission after just one or two doses\u2014up to 87.5% in Phase 3 trials with 25 mg of psilocybin. These treatments are administered in hospitals under strict medical supervision. Maria Due\u00f1as from Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u confirmed the significant antidepressant effects of psilocybin in clinical trials. Other psychedelics like LSD and ayahuasca also show efficacy and safety. While no psychedelics are yet approved for prescription, experts believe they will bring a 'radical change' in depression treatment. The future of depression care is moving toward personalized medicine, integrating biological diagnosis, pharmacogenetics, and targeted therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Specialists like V\u00edctor P\u00e9rez and Maria Portella emphasize the importance of individualized, biologically informed treatment. Claudi Camps, director of Mental Health and Addictions in Girona, stresses the need for a holistic approach, recognizing that depression arises from a combination of biological vulnerability, trauma, poverty, and psychosocial stressors. He notes that unresolved childhood trauma can resurface in adulthood, exacerbating depression\u2014highlighting the importance of revisiting past experiences in therapy. Despite progress, chronic and treatment-resistant cases remain challenging, with relapses common after one to two years, though psychedelics and deep brain stimulation are improving outcomes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/ser-feliz/20251006/hospitales-validan-tratar-depresion-cronica-121660944)\n\n**New Medical Breakthrough Reduces Breast Cancer Progression Risk by 40%**\nIn October 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Inluriyo, an innovative oral medication for advanced breast cancer, marking a significant medical breakthrough. The drug, which belongs to the class of estrogen receptor antagonists, reduces the risk of disease progression by up to 40%. Clinical trial data from the phase 3 EMBER-3 study showed that Inluriyo reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 8% compared to traditional hormonal therapies. It works by binding to and degrading estrogen receptors, thereby inhibiting their activity and slowing tumor growth and spread. Patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying the ESR1 mutation\u2014present in about half of those previously treated with hormonal therapy\u2014experienced a median progression-free survival of five months, compared to three months with other treatments. Dr. Komal Jhaveri, clinical director for early drug development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, emphasized the drug\u2019s proven efficacy and oral administration ease, calling it a promising option for patients whose disease progresses after standard treatments. The FDA warns against using the drug during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm. Common side effects observed in trials include [specific side effects not listed in text, but implied to be documented]. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women globally, often arising from uncontrolled cell division in the breast that can spread to other body parts. Over 80% of cases are invasive, meaning the tumor can spread beyond the breast tissue. While most common in women over 50, it can affect younger women and, rarely, men. This breakthrough, announced during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, represents a major step toward better control of the disease and improved quality of life and health stability for patients worldwide.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/new-medical-reduces-breast-cancer)\n\n**Highs & Lows: Could the microdosing of psychedelics be a key missing piece in the mental health jigsaw?**\nThe article reports a renewed scientific interest in psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, ketamine and MDMA as potential treatments for anxiety, depression, PTSD and other mental\u2011health disorders. A mid\u2011stage study released in early September found that microdosing the pharmaceutical LSD MM120 could reduce anxiety for up to three months (study cited in article). WHO data cited in the article show that over a billion people worldwide live with mental\u2011health conditions; suicide claimed 727,000 lives in 2021; and depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1\u202ftrillion annually (WHO 2025 report). It notes that only about one\u2011third of patients on conventional antidepressants improve (article). The article includes quotes: Pollan says 'Mental health crises will drive acceptance of these unconventional therapies, in large part because the conventional therapies are not working very well' (Pollan to ET); Dr. Ryan L. Henner says 'The data on cannabis remains cloudy for most conditions it is purported to treat' (Henner); David Nutt says 'there is strong public support for these drugs as medicines as modern scientific studies show the ban through the UN conventions of 1960 and 1971 was politically\u2011, not science\u2011driven' (Nutt); Vidita Vaidya says 'While we do have ketamine\u2011assisted therapy in India, we don't have a progressive policy on our own clinical trials to be able to move the envelope for ourselves' (Vaidya). The article also discusses regulatory hurdles: the FDA rejected Lykos Therapeutics' MDMA\u2011assisted therapy for PTSD because of difficulty blinding studies (FDA rejection cited); the FDA observed that the difficulty to blind these studies made data hard to interpret (FDA observation). It notes that the FDA\u2019s rejection led researchers to double down on blinding (article). It mentions that the Indian Narcotics Act allows medical research but implementation is difficult (Anita Abraham). The article concludes that while psychedelics offer promise, rigorous trials, therapy integration and careful regulation are essential (article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/highs-lows-could-the-microdosing-of-psychedelics-be-a-key-missing-piece-in-the-mental-health-jigsaw/articleshow/124186421.cms)\n\n**British doctors: 'Psychedelic drugs are promising'**\nBritish psychiatrists have released a new report stating that psychedelic drugs could one day aid in treating mental illnesses, but the evidence is not yet strong enough to bring them to patients. The report, issued by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, reviews ongoing phase\u2011III trials across the UK, continental Europe and the United States involving substances such as MDMA, ketamine, LSD and psilocybin. The trials combine the drugs with talk therapy and aim to treat anxiety, depression, post\u2011traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction. \n\n\"We are cautious but excited,\" said Oliver Howes, chair of the university\u2019s psychopharmacology committee, during a press briefing. Howes, a molecular psychiatry professor at King\u2019s College London, added, \"There is a lot of activity and this is promising, but there is also a lot of complexity,\" and called for scientific activity and caution. He warned that \"participants can often tell whether they are receiving a real drug or a placebo, which makes blinding difficult,\" and that reproducibility of findings is a challenge. \n\nThe report urges more research into safety, efficacy and long\u2011term use, and the creation of a central database to monitor drug effects. An EU\u2011funded trial launched last year tested psilocybin in people with multiple sclerosis and other progressive conditions to see if it could reduce anxiety and depression. Some countries, including Germany, have already started compassionate\u2011use programmes for psychedelics, allowing patients to access the drugs under strict oversight before formal approval. In the Czech Republic, psilocybin will become legal for treating depression from 2026, though full approval for a broader range of psychedelics in Europe is still years away. Howes advised people not to self\u2011treat with psychedelics and instead enroll in clinical trials, emphasising that the substances should only be used under psychiatric leadership and a multidisciplinary team.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 07:38 AM\nSource:[euronews](http://tr.euronews.com/saglik/2025/09/19/ingiliz-doktorlar-psikedelik-ilaclar-umut-verici)\n\n**Psychedelic medicine shows promise but is not yet ready for prescription**\nA new report by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom finds that psychedelic drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, LSD and psilocybin may help treat a range of mental\u2011health conditions\u2014including anxiety, depression, post\u2011traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction\u2014but that the evidence is not yet strong enough to recommend routine clinical use.  The study reviewed existing trials and concluded that high\u2011quality data are lacking, so clinicians should not prescribe these substances outside of controlled research settings.  \"Estamos cautelosamente entusiasmados,\" said Oliver Howes, one of the report\u2019s authors and chair of the college\u2019s psychopharmacology committee, at a press conference.  \"H\u00e1 uma enorme quantidade de atividade e estes ensaios s\u00e3o promissores, mas h\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m uma enorme complexidade,\" Howes added, noting the need for sober science and caution.

The new law follows a model similar to Australia\u2019s 2024 regulations, where MDMA and psilocybin are approved for treating post\u2011traumatic stress disorder and treatment\u2011resistant depression, respectively. Unlike Australia, the Czech law does not include MDMA and restricts psilocybin to synthetic preparations, whereas New\u202fMexico in the United States has allowed the use of natural Psilocybe mushrooms. Only psychiatrists trained in psychotherapy may prescribe psychedelic substances in a clinical setting; general and public hospitals receive automatic authorization to offer the treatment, while other facilities will need special licensing.\n\nThe legislation also decriminalizes cannabis possession. In the United States, a broader biomedical regulation of psychedelic\u2011assisted psychotherapy (PAP) was expected but was rejected by the FDA in August of the previous year, denying a license for MDMA in post\u2011traumatic stress disorder from the company Lykos. The change in U.S. administration has opened the possibility of approval for psychedelic treatments, with figures such as Robert\u202fKennedy\u202fJr. and veterans, firefighters, and police officers advocating for their use.\n\nIn a September\u202f11 article in *Psychoactives*, Czech lawyer Tereza\u202fDlestikova critiques the new medical model, arguing that the reform remains incomplete without evidence\u2011based debate on non\u2011clinical uses of psychedelics.

The CRL was one of 89 rejection letters issued last week, and it cited several safety and efficacy concerns.  Lykos failed to provide data on adverse events that would help assess abuse potential, did not demonstrate that treatment effects lasted beyond the eight\u2011week assessment period after the last dose \u2013 a period the FDA says must show durable benefit for a chronic condition \u2013 and the study had high rates of prescreening failure and prior MDMA use, raising the possibility of selection bias.  The FDA therefore recommended a new clinical trial to address these gaps.  FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency will promptly release new CRLs and approvals, redacted for trade secrets, to help developers understand the FDA\u2019s reasoning.  \"We want drug developers and inventors to understand exactly how the FDA thinks,\" Makary said in a video on X.  Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, praised the Trump administration for making the CRL public and noted that the FDA \u201cmoved the goalposts,\u201d shifting its standards after the study was underway.  Doblin said the public can now see the FDA\u2019s reasoning.  The article also notes that psychedelics advocates, buoyed by comments from Kennedy and Makary about speeding up research, hope for a better chance under the Trump administration than under Biden.  In other news, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hear from former Meta employees about alleged discouragement of harm documentation, and California lawmakers are advancing a bill that would prohibit AI chatbots from presenting themselves as licensed medical professionals.

This growth is driven by the increasing scientific validation of psychedelics for mental health therapies beyond traditional pharmaceuticals. Key substances under investigation include psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, ketamine, and DMT, showing potential to treat depression, PTSD, anxiety, addiction, and end-of-life distress. The transition from recreational stigma to clinical utility is propelled by escalating mental illness rates, the search for alternative treatments, and a mounting body of evidence supporting psychedelic efficacy in treatment-resistant cases. Regulatory shifts and decriminalization efforts, particularly in North America and Europe, are also advancing this research. Significant investments and strategic alliances are aimed at commercializing psychedelic-assisted therapies effectively and safely. The FDA's breakthrough therapy designations for psilocybin and MDMA-based treatments addressing major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD expedited clinical trial timelines, boosting investor confidence.

This comes after a new study was requested by the authorities, which was a setback for advocates like Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Doblin is optimistic about the development, but also concerned that the public might get the wrong message: 'Now that RFK likes psychedelics, they're allowed.' The FDA has announced a new program to speed up the approval process for medications that benefit public health, including psychedelics. This includes reducing the testing time from six months or more to just one month, and potentially relaxing the requirements for certain medications. The US Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA have also hired new employees with connections to the psychedelic movement. 'This is a very promising sign that the government is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to send a signal that they are willing to allow them,' said Greg Ferenstein, a staff writer at the libertarian Reason Foundation. However, some experts, like Philip Corlett, a psychiatrist at Yale University, are concerned that the hype around psychedelics is outpacing the science. 'If RFK and the new administration are serious about this, they could do a lot to bring it into reality by meeting the standards of medical science,' Corlett said.

Kennedy Jr. and Trump Allies Push for Psychedelic Therapies Despite FDA Rejection**\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. and allies of Donald Trump are pushing for the use of psychedelic therapies to treat anxiety and depression, despite the FDA's rejection of MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the Biden administration. Kennedy stated, 'This line of therapy has a huge advantage if administered in a clinical setting, and we're working hard to ensure that happens within 12 months.' The FDA has begun to review its stance on psychedelics, with Director Marty Makary calling the review of MDMA and other psychedelics 'a top priority.' Makary also announced measures to speed up the approval of new treatments, including reducing the review time from six months to one and relaxing traditional requirements such as placebo-controlled clinical trials. Greg Ferenstein, an advisor to psychedelic companies and member of the Reason Foundation, stated, 'All these are very promising signs.' Texas has allocated $50 million to study the use of ibogaine, a psychedelic derived from an African plant, as a treatment for addiction and PTSD. The support includes former Republican Governor Rick Perry and veterans who have traveled to Mexico to receive treatment. Marcus Capone, a former Navy SEAL, testified that ibogaine helped him overcome anxiety and depression after 13 years of service. However, not all medical professionals share the enthusiasm, with Philip Corlett, a researcher at Yale, warning that avoiding rigorous clinical trials could be counterproductive. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, recognized the potential of ibogaine but noted that previous studies were suspended due to 'cardiovascular toxicity.' Despite the controversy, the debate on psychedelics is reopening in the US political center, with the next decision depending on regulators' ability to balance therapeutic promise with scientific evidence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 03:21 PM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2025/07/16/robert-f-kennedy-jr-y-aliados-de-trump-impulsan-terapias-con-psicodelicos-para-combatir-la-ansiedad-y-la-depresion-pese-a-reves-de-la-fda/)\n\n**New Hope for Mental Health: Can Psychedelic Substances Be a Breakthrough?**\nThe European Commission is already taking action. Within the Horizon Europe program, it has funded the PsyPal study with 6.5 million euros, led by a consortium of 18 research centers and universities, with the University of Groninga as the lead. The researchers aim to verify the effectiveness of psilocybin treatment for various mental disorders: post-traumatic stress disorder, depression in patients with palliative care needs for severe diseases such as ALS or COPD. The study is generating high expectations. The question is: can psychedelic substances really be a new frontier in treating many mental illnesses? Commonly known as drugs, they are illegal and stigmatized, but in therapeutic doses and always associated with psychotherapy, they could be a breakthrough? The University of Trento, with the first Italian conference on the topic, promoted by the Department of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences, asked this question last year. The conference broke a taboo. Following the many clinical trials conducted abroad, which seem to demonstrate their effectiveness, a specific scientific society, Simepsi, was born in Italy about a year ago, led by psychiatrist Mauro D'Alonzo, which deals with training and research on psychedelic medicine. 'If the law passes also in the Senate, it will be the first EU country to introduce them in therapeutic protocols,' says Caterina Bartoli, a doctor and member of Simepsi. In Australia, psilocybin and MDMA are already approved and prescribable. The first is also authorized in New Zealand, while in Switzerland it is regularly used on request from psychiatrists after the green light from a specific commission. 'In reality, the use of these psychoactive substances has a millennial history,' says Tania Re, a psychotherapist and anthropologist who also works in Switzerland in collaboration with psychiatrists. 'It's a history linked to the culture of many indigenous communities and passed down orally from generation to generation. It's crucial to continue to investigate their safety and efficacy, the neurobiological mechanisms and the optimal procedures for a safe and replicable therapy.' 'There are many advanced studies, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom - explains Bartoli - with a strong increase in scientific publications on the subject. In the US, the phase III of a study on the efficacy of MDMA in treating post-traumatic stress disorder has just been concluded, conducted by the scientific society Maps and the pharmaceutical company Lykos.' The Food and Drug Administration, the US regulatory agency, has asked for further data, although a 70% efficacy has already been demonstrated with just three administrations. In the UK, depression is the focus. In this field, the study by the pharmaceutical giant Compass Pathways, which has also reached phase III, is worth mentioning. The study on the treatment with psilocybin, which would validate the effectiveness of the psychedelic substance, compared to a traditional antidepressant, with a single administration, is being conducted under strict medical control, also to manage any potential side effects, such as headaches, nausea, and increased blood pressure. 'Effects that generally resolve within 24 hours,' continues Bartoli. In Italy, the only substance with psychedelic effects authorized is esketamine, a derivative of ketamine, commonly used in operating rooms. It is used by psychiatrists in the form of a nasal spray. In the US, it is used for treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation, while in Italy only for treatment-resistant depression. Since 2017, thanks to a ministerial decree, the use of psychedelic substances is allowed only in exceptional and compassionate cases. However, they are never prescribed. And there are no clinical trials involving Italian universities. 'On the one hand, there is still a lack of knowledge in the field among our doctors, on the other hand, the molecules with psychoactive effects are still perceived as recreational drugs, to get a high,' observes Bartoli. From here, the initiative of the Luca Coscioni association, which has launched an appeal to the government, signed by 170 doctors, researchers, and psychotherapists, to allow the use of these experimental treatments. An appeal accompanied by a signature collection, promoted together with Simepsi, to ask the European Commission to fund research on psychedelics. 'The resistances are not only of an ideological type: a part of the medical class remains anchored to traditional medicine based on psychopharmaceuticals,' says Marco Perduca, coordinator of all the activities of the association related to psychoactive substances.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 24, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[Il Sole 24 ORE](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/disturbi-mentali-nuova-speranza-cura-puo-arrivare-sostanze-psichedeliche-AHC8b5NB)\n\n",

    "summary": "The panel of forecasting experts expresses a range of views on whether the next regulatory step for medical approval of psychedelics for mental health will be taken in the US during 2025. All experts note that the FDA's 2024 rejection of MDMA for PTSD set a high bar for evidence, indicating strong regulatory caution and a need for additional or more robust clinical trials. As of October 2025, no new NDA, EUA filing, or DEA rescheduling for classic psychedelics targeting DSM-5 disorders has been publicly reported.\n\nDespite this, there is broad agreement that the political and regulatory environment has shifted significantly. Many forecasters highlight the new administration's explicit prioritization of psychedelic therapies, public statements from FDA and HHS leadership in favor of accelerated review, increasing advocacy from veterans and influential political figures, and notable activity from companies like Arcadia Medicine (though these are characterized as pipeline developments rather than imminent NDA/EUA filings).\n\nSeveral factors increase the probability of a filing or rescheduling before year-end: unprecedented political will (including signals from figures like RFK Jr., Trump, and FDA Commissioner Makary), pressure from advocacy groups, and global/regional momentum (with approvals in Australia and the Czech Republic). The resolution criteria require only the filing of a qualifying NDA/EUA or formal DEA rescheduling\u2014regardless of acceptance\u2014which most experts note lowers the bar compared to outright approval.\n\nHowever, persistent barriers remain: the lack of mature Phase 3 US trial results for leading candidates like psilocybin, ongoing regulatory conservatism, procedural inertia in FDA/DEA processes, and no clear news of imminent filings. Some experts give weight to the possibility of a symbolic or politically motivated filing or DEA move late in the year, viewing this as plausible but not certain.\n\nProbabilities assigned by the experts are varied but generally elevated compared to historical base rates, reflecting the current unique convergence of scientific, policy, and advocacy factors. Forecasts range from a low of 17-18% (emphasizing scientific and regulatory inertia) to mid-range estimates of 30-40% (weighing political momentum against procedural delays), up to 62-68% from those that put more emphasis on political and bureaucratic willingness to expedite matters. Two forecasters place the odds just above even (65-68%).\n\nThe group consensus thus converges on a moderate-to-high but not overwhelming probability that the next step (NDA, EUA filing, or DEA rescheduling) could occur before the close of 2025\u2014most likely as a result of political pressure or regulatory signaling, but still with substantial uncertainty due to pipeline readiness and enduring FDA/DEA standards. Median probability across forecasters is just above 40%, with the mean closer to 50% due to several higher outliers.",
