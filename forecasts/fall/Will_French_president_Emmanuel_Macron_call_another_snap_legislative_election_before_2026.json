Despite instability, Macron endures the impasse without dissolving the Assembly again, either waiting for presidential elections in 2027 or trying lesser remedies (further reshuffles, reforms, concessions, EU negotiations). Mass protests and strikes continue but do not force his hand; no constitutional impasse legally compels dissolution. Macron avoids further damaging his legacy and party by enduring minority rule.",

With no stable majority and critical deadlines looming (budget passage, EU financial sanctions, public order breakdown), Macron concludes that legislative paralysis poses an existential risk to governance or France's international standing/finances and calls for a new election by December 2025, hoping either to reset the balance or pass a caretaker budget with a new Assembly.",

If the Lecornu government falls quickly and a successor cannot be formed (with the budget deadline, EU pressure, or escalating civil unrest), Macron could be cornered into dissolving the Assembly again, especially if political pressure mounts that the crisis cannot be managed by reshuffles or coalition-building. However, the weight of institutional and political precedent, legal constraints (one-year wait), the disastrous example of the 2024 dissolution, and Macron\u2019s apparent aversion to repeating it even amidst chaos, all weigh heavily against such a move. Public opinion is overwhelming against another dissolution, and repeated dissolutions are nearly unprecedented in the Fifth Republic's history. Macron\u2019s actions (consistent avoidance of dissolution in favor of PM rotations and coalition deals) suggest he will exhaust all possible alternatives first. I judge the base rate and Macron's incentives (risk aversion, desire to avoid empowering his opponents, political damage) significantly outweigh the drivers for an affirmative scenario. That said, the probability is unusually high by historical standards: the scenario remains plausible if the situation worsens or becomes completely ungovernable. I set the final probability at 22%.",

Bowing to social unrest and mounting calls from both opposition and his own camp to reset the government (perhaps following an acute crisis\u2014budgetary, Eurozone, or external shock), Macron dissolves the National Assembly again before January 1, 2026, in an effort to force a new parliamentary configuration.",

However, several factors combine to make another snap election unlikely unless there is absolutely no alternative. Historically, repeat dissolutions in less than two years are almost unheard of, and current polling, public opinion, and risk-reward calculus all line up against Macron calling a new election\u2014unless he faces total ungovernability and acute destabilization. The French people overwhelmingly do not want another dissolution, and Macron\u2019s standing is so low that he has little reason (and historic precedent against) risking an even worse outcome for himself and his party. Still, the possibility cannot be ruled out entirely due to the ongoing, acute instability and the real threat of paralysis. If no government can be maintained beyond a month or two, or if a constitutional budget crash occurs, dissolution may become the only remaining legal option. On balance, given the news as of late September 2025, I assess the probability that Macron will call another snap legislative election or Assembly dissolution before January 1, 2026 as 28%: higher than the historic base rate, but well below even because of massive political and electoral headwinds and the existence of (so far) alternatives even in severe crisis.",

However, the current crisis is extraordinary: five PMs in two years, no parliamentary workable majority, repeated failures to pass a budget, massive protests, fiscal market pressure, and calls from the opposition (esp. RN/Le Pen) for a snap vote. The key variable is whether a minimal working majority for budgets can be cobbled together. If the government collapses again and there is no path to budget passage after another PM falls, and the eurozone/IMF/fiscal threat becomes acute, Macron could opt for a desperate dissolution, but this would likely destroy his remnant legitimacy and risk boosting extreme factions. Given all this, the probability is elevated above historical base rate but well south of even odds.

The most persuasive critiques highlight that the present level of institutional dysfunction\u2014in particular, the failure of five governments in under two years, budget deadlock, mass protest, and the real possibility of fiscal/market crisis\u2014create a plausible path for rational actors to choose dissolution, albeit only as a last resort.

Given the consistent lack of evidence for total deadlock or a forced hand as of September 2025, but also the elevated threat of such an eventuality in this unique scenario, I see no compelling reason to revise upward from my initial, mid-high estimate.

Most forecasts\u2014ranging from around 8% to 32%\u2014are anchored on the combination of uniquely persistent government instability and severe coalition fragmentation, balanced against overwhelming public and elite opposition to a repeat dissolution and the recent political backlash from Macron\u2019s last attempt in 2024. The critiques, especially my own engagement with \u2018FrenchStudiesFifthRepublicConstitutionalAnalysis\u2019 and others hovering in the low to upper 20s, suggest reasonable disagreement about just how close France is to a 'terminal' crisis before year\u2019s end. I remain convinced that the current parliamentary deadlock, compounded by the risk of a market or budgetary crisis, is historically unique and justifies a probability higher than the 20\u201328% cluster, though not by a large margin. No new evidence emerged to reduce the risk of continuing instability; if anything, the possibility of compounding crisis is better illustrated by the ensemble of arguments. I therefore maintain my initial estimate at 32%, as it reflects both the rare nature of the scenario and the acute risk factors identified by both myself and other high-end forecasters, while also not exceeding the threshold for a more likely than not event.",

The critique of my low estimate highlights the compounding effect of failed government formation attempts, rising financial pressure, and the possibility of an acute exogenous shock (e.g. EU/IMF ultimatum, credit-market freeze). Several forecasters convincingly argue that the costs of muddling-through might soon outstrip the very high risks for Macron in a context where all other tools are exhausted. Thus, it is prudent to substantially raise my estimate\u2014while remaining far from even odds, as No is still likeliest\u2014since current conditions are more extreme and volatile than almost any comparable period in Fifth Republic history.",

While critiques suggested that base-rate analysis might underweight the current unprecedented institutional deadlock, and others argued for marginally higher risk under severe fiscal/market shock, the most robust comparative and constitutional analyses consistently highlight historical aversion to repeated dissolutions and Macron\u2019s incentive to avoid this move. No new compelling evidence arose to suggest an abrupt qualitative shift in the risk landscape since the Phase 1 forecast, and peer argumentation validates my balanced approach\u2014assigning nonzero but less-than-even odds, well above the pure historical base rate, but not approaching parity.

Debate also clarified that while repeated government collapse and budget impasses amplify risk, France\u2019s institutional 'muddle through' tradition and incumbent incentives are even more powerful than I initially weighted. Though my original 20% forecast is somewhat above the median, it is solidly justified compared to the very low but nonzero probabilities (8\u201318%) cluster among constitutional and comparative-political specialists, and just below the 22\u201332% range of more instability-focused models.

Several forecasters\u2014especially from Coalition Theory and Executive-Legislative Relations\u2014make a persuasive case that the tripolar parliament and rapid turnover of PMs make a true governing solution increasingly unlikely. While arguments for a very low base rate and Macron's risk aversion are well supported, the unprecedented nature of recent developments justifies weighting the probability somewhat higher than my initial 18%.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nFollowing the 2024 EU Parliament elections, France saw the rise of the right wing National Rally. This made French president Emmanuel Macron call early legislative elections and dissolution of the National Assembly, in response. \n\nFollowing the 2024 french legislative elections, the National Assembly has been mostly split three-ways, between the big tent, left wing grouping [New Popular Front with 180 seats; the centrist Ensemble with 159 seats; and the aforementioned National rally with 142 seats. None of the above gaining a majority in the 577 seat parliament](https://www.resultats-elections.interieur.gouv.fr/legislatives2024/ensemble_geographique/index.html). Some feel that this polarized parliament could lead to government deadlock, with any formed government potentially having a hard time surviving a motion of no confidence against it. This may potentially lead to Macron calling another snap election before the next scheduled legislative election, to ease the potential deadlock, which the french constitution only allow after a year since the previous legislative election.\n\nSee also from Le Monde: [Snap elections in France: How it works, precedents, and consequences](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/article/2024/06/10/snap-elections-in-france-how-it-works-precedents-and-consequences_6674391_8.html)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":26114,\"question_id\":26114}}`",

Following President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to call an early election in July 2024, the parliament struggles to secure a majority to pass the budget, while a nationwide strike on 18\u202fSeptember\u2014triggered by unions opposing earlier budget proposals\u2014further stalls governance. The piece cites a Fitch rating cut on 12\u202fSeptember that raises doubts about France\u2019s debt\u2011repayment capacity, and projects that France will need to allocate \u20ac67\u202fbillion to debt repayment this year, with the figure expected to rise to \u20ac100\u202fbillion annually after ten years. It also highlights the risk of France seeking IMF assistance or ECB intervention. The article quotes Italian newspapers mocking France\u2019s situation, including Il\u202fMessaggero\u2019s question, \u2018\u015ea\u015faaya ne oldu?\u2019 and French political commentators such as Nicolas\u202fBaverez, who warns that France\u2019s sovereignty and freedom are in danger, and that the country is \"paralyzed in debt, chaos and powerlessness.\" It further discusses the fragmented political landscape\u2014three factions (centre, left, far\u2011right) unable to form a stable government\u2014alongside Macron\u2019s attempts to secure support from his new prime minister, S\u00e9bastien\u202fLecornu, and the challenges posed by the National Rally and La\u202fFrance\u202fInsoumise. The article concludes with a warning that France could become Europe\u2019s new sick man if the crisis is not resolved, citing the potential for a new election and the risk of a political collapse.

Macron\u2019s decision is described as a \"political error\" that the president will later admit, because it broke the usual pattern in which the president\u2019s party holds a relative majority after the legislative elections.  The 2024 early elections produced three blocs: the left\u2011wing New Popular Front (NFP) with 182 deputies, the centre\u2011right coalition (Renaissance, Horizons, Modem, Les R\u00e9publicains) and the RN.  None of the blocs achieved the 289\u2011deputy majority required for an absolute majority in the 577\u2011seat chamber, but the NFP held a relative majority.\n\nMacron bypassed the democratic rule that the prime minister (PM) should come from the majority bloc and appointed Michel\u202fBarnier, a former minister from Les R\u00e9publicains, in September\u202f2024.  Barnier\u2019s appointment was justified by the desire to consolidate the centre\u2011right coalition and his reputation as a skilled negotiator, especially after his role in the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.  The article quotes Barnier\u2019s willingness to \"consider\" the RN and notes that the RN had been pursuing a strategy of legitimacy by presenting itself as a responsible party.\n\nBarnier\u2019s tenure was short\u2011lived.  He was toppled by a vote of no confidence in December\u202f2024, becoming the second PM in the Fifth Republic to be removed in this way after Georges\u202fPompidou.  Macron then appointed Fran\u00e7ois\u202fBayrou, leader of the Democratic Movement (Modem), as PM.  Bayrou\u2019s appointment was seen as a continuation of Macron\u2019s politics, and the article describes his attempt to \"overcome the Himalaya\" of political divisions.  Bayrou survived a no\u2011confidence motion in January\u202f2025 thanks to the Socialist Party (PS), but was again ousted in September\u202f2025 over a budget dispute that included the removal of two public holidays and a proposed 44\u202fbillion\u2011euro savings plan, while the left demanded only 22\u202fbillion euros.\n\nThe article concludes that the appointment of S\u00e9bastien\u202fLecornu as Bayrou\u2019s successor offers no clear prospects.  Lecornu, a long\u2011time minister, may face the same fate as his predecessors, potentially leading to another dissolution of the Assembly and a possible co\u2011habitation, the first since 1997.  The piece uses a negative tone, describing the events as \"political mistakes\" and \"suicide politique\", and emphasizes the instability and lack of clear direction.\n\nKey metrics cited: 577 total deputies, 289 required for an absolute majority, 182 deputies for the NFP, 44\u202fbillion euros savings in Barnier\u2019s 2025 budget, 22\u202fbillion euros proposed by the left, and a national debt exceeding 100\u202f% of GDP.

The proposals included a veto on the Zucman tax, the return of the ISF, a suspension \u2013 and even a possible abolition \u2013 of the pension reform, a tentative opening to the right on state medical aid, and vague statements on other matters such as public spending cuts and a \u201cblank year\u201d.  The Parisian press described the PM\u2019s remarks as a \u201cmain vide\u201d and \u201cmots creux\u201d.  For the Socialist Party (PS), the promised break was absent; Olivier\u202fFaure warned that the party would meet the PM next week and, if no major change occurs, will move to censure the government.  The PS feels empowered by the broad public support for its fiscal and pension proposals, while the PM\u2019s confidence rating is at a historic low and his coalition \u2013 comprising Renaissance, Modem, UDI, Horizons and Les\u202fR\u00e9publicains \u2013 remains fragile.  A new mobilisation day is scheduled for 2\u202fOctober, with the PM expected to convene a meeting with the socialists that Friday and a fourth meeting with the coalition on Monday.  The PM\u2019s strategy is to avoid after\u2011sales support, limiting himself to two written interviews and no radio or TV appearances, which has led to accusations of \u201cdure\u201d tactics.  The National Rally accuses the PM of \u201ctrying to buy time\u201d, and the RN\u2019s Jean\u2011Philippe\u202fTanguy calls for a swift dissolution.  The PM promised a government \u201cbefore the parliamentary work begins\u201d, implying a deadline of 1\u202fOctober or, more realistically, by the end of the week.  The article quotes the PM\u2019s own words: \u2018Nous rencontrerons une derni\u00e8re fois le Premier ministre la semaine prochaine \u00e0 sa demande.

Following President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to call an early election in July 2024, the parliament struggles to secure a majority to pass the budget, while a nationwide strike on 18\u202fSeptember\u2014triggered by unions opposing earlier budget proposals\u2014further stalls governance. The piece cites a Fitch rating cut on 12\u202fSeptember that raises doubts about France\u2019s debt\u2011repayment capacity, and projects that France will need to allocate \u20ac67\u202fbillion to debt repayment this year, with the figure expected to rise to \u20ac100\u202fbillion annually after ten years. It also highlights the risk of France seeking IMF assistance or ECB intervention. The article quotes Italian newspapers mocking France\u2019s situation, including Il\u202fMessaggero\u2019s question, \u2018\u015ea\u015faaya ne oldu?\u2019 and French political commentators such as Nicolas\u202fBaverez, who warns that France\u2019s sovereignty and freedom are in danger, and that the country is \"paralyzed in debt, chaos and powerlessness.\" It further discusses the fragmented political landscape\u2014three factions (centre, left, far\u2011right) unable to form a stable government\u2014alongside Macron\u2019s attempts to secure support from his new prime minister, S\u00e9bastien\u202fLecornu, and the challenges posed by the National Rally and La\u202fFrance\u202fInsoumise. The article concludes with a warning that France could become Europe\u2019s new sick man if the crisis is not resolved, citing the potential for a new election and the risk of a political collapse.

Macron\u2019s decision is described as a \"political error\" that the president will later admit, because it broke the usual pattern in which the president\u2019s party holds a relative majority after the legislative elections.  The 2024 early elections produced three blocs: the left\u2011wing New Popular Front (NFP) with 182 deputies, the centre\u2011right coalition (Renaissance, Horizons, Modem, Les R\u00e9publicains) and the RN.  None of the blocs achieved the 289\u2011deputy majority required for an absolute majority in the 577\u2011seat chamber, but the NFP held a relative majority.\n\nMacron bypassed the democratic rule that the prime minister (PM) should come from the majority bloc and appointed Michel\u202fBarnier, a former minister from Les R\u00e9publicains, in September\u202f2024.  Barnier\u2019s appointment was justified by the desire to consolidate the centre\u2011right coalition and his reputation as a skilled negotiator, especially after his role in the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.  The article quotes Barnier\u2019s willingness to \"consider\" the RN and notes that the RN had been pursuing a strategy of legitimacy by presenting itself as a responsible party.\n\nBarnier\u2019s tenure was short\u2011lived.  He was toppled by a vote of no confidence in December\u202f2024, becoming the second PM in the Fifth Republic to be removed in this way after Georges\u202fPompidou.  Macron then appointed Fran\u00e7ois\u202fBayrou, leader of the Democratic Movement (Modem), as PM.  Bayrou\u2019s appointment was seen as a continuation of Macron\u2019s politics, and the article describes his attempt to \"overcome the Himalaya\" of political divisions.  Bayrou survived a no\u2011confidence motion in January\u202f2025 thanks to the Socialist Party (PS), but was again ousted in September\u202f2025 over a budget dispute that included the removal of two public holidays and a proposed 44\u202fbillion\u2011euro savings plan, while the left demanded only 22\u202fbillion euros.\n\nThe article concludes that the appointment of S\u00e9bastien\u202fLecornu as Bayrou\u2019s successor offers no clear prospects.  Lecornu, a long\u2011time minister, may face the same fate as his predecessors, potentially leading to another dissolution of the Assembly and a possible co\u2011habitation, the first since 1997.  The piece uses a negative tone, describing the events as \"political mistakes\" and \"suicide politique\", and emphasizes the instability and lack of clear direction.\n\nKey metrics cited: 577 total deputies, 289 required for an absolute majority, 182 deputies for the NFP, 44\u202fbillion euros savings in Barnier\u2019s 2025 budget, 22\u202fbillion euros proposed by the left, and a national debt exceeding 100\u202f% of GDP.

The judge handed Sarkozy a five\u2011year prison term, making him the first post\u2011World\u2011War\u202fII French president to be incarcerated.  According to the court, the sentence is immediately enforceable, but the president is allowed a short period to settle his affairs; he is not permitted to avoid imprisonment pending appeal.  \"The verdict shows that no one is above the law,\" said Ludovic Friat, president of the USM, the largest union of French prosecutors and judges.  \"There will be a clear before\u2011and\u2011after to this decision,\" he added.  The article reports that 89\u202f% of sentences longer than two years are enforced before an appeal is concluded, a figure cited by Judith Allenbach, president of another judges\u2019 association.  The conviction has prompted calls for the abolition of the practice of immediately enforceable sentences.  Meanwhile, Marine Le\u202fPen, the leader of the far\u2011right National Rally, faces a separate five\u2011year political ban for alleged EU\u2011fund embezzlement, which could bar her from running in the 2027 election.  Le\u202fPen\u2019s supporters claim that right\u2011wing politicians are treated more harshly by judges, citing the acquittal of former centrist Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.  The article also notes that US President Donald Trump has described Le\u202fPen as a victim of \"lawfare\" and has sent a diplomatic delegation in her support.  French political figures are divided: conservative Senate president G\u00e9rard Larcher expressed concern over the debate on immediate enforcement, while left\u2011wing MP Manuel Bompard praised the call for honesty and rule of law.

It explains that Kurz\u2019s government faces several challenges: approving the 2026 budget, dealing with a new wave of protests, and avoiding a potential loss of confidence from opposition parties, especially the left. The piece notes that France has been politically unstable since the European elections of June\u202f2024, citing Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly and call early parliamentary elections in July\u202f2024, which produced a hung parliament with the left\u2011wing Popular Front winning 182 seats, the pro\u2011Macron \u201cEnsemble\u201d bloc 168 seats, and the far\u2011right National Rally 143 seats. The article highlights three main factors behind the crisis: (1) Macron\u2019s failure to build a \u201cthird way\u201d and his shift to liberal\u2011right policies, (2) the erosion of democratic norms through the use of Article\u202f49.3 to pass legislation without a parliamentary majority, and (3) the rise of populist forces that have pressured Macron to resign. It also details Kurz\u2019s potential difficulties: securing a majority for the 2026 budget, managing protests that began on 10 and 18\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 with about 500 arrests, and negotiating with left\u2011wing and far\u2011right parties. The article concludes that the most likely outcome is a minority government that may face a confidence vote or a dissolution of the Assembly.

B\u00e9ru, a centrist from the Democratic Movement, had taken office in December\u202f2023 and had already faced criticism for her 2026 budget plan that cut \u20ac43.8\u202fbillion in spending and aimed to bring the deficit to 4.6\u202f% of GDP. The fragmented Assembly\u2014577 seats split among the New People Front (190), Together (161) and the National Rally (123)\u2014makes it difficult for any coalition to secure a majority. Macron now faces a choice between appointing a new prime minister who can survive in this divided chamber or dissolving the Assembly and calling early elections; he has so far rejected the latter option.

The political deadlock coincides with social unrest: a nationwide \u2018full\u2011lockdown\u2019 protest is planned for 10\u202fSeptember, with a poll showing that two\u2011thirds of respondents support it, and a general strike on 18\u202fSeptember has been called by several unions.

The vote left France in a political deadlock just before the 2027 presidential election. Political scientist Eric Monteiro said it is unclear who could form a government that would keep stability until 2027. The article explains that the parliament is divided into three ideological groups \u2013 far\u2011left, far\u2011right and a central bloc that splits into many sub\u2011factions \u2013 and that no one will want to take the premiership close to the presidential election. A poll from 8\u202fSeptember showed Emmanuel Macron\u2019s popularity at 15\u202f%, the lowest in the Fifth Republic, and the far\u2011right Rassemblement National wants a dissolution of the Assembly, while the left wants a new left\u2011wing figure. The author argues that a dissolution would give the Rassemblement National a plurality of 30\u201135\u202f% but still insufficient to govern.

The motion was prompted by Bayru\u2019s own initiative, who had sought the chamber\u2019s support amid a prolonged budget crisis that centred on a 44\u202fbillion\u2011euro cut plan presented in July. Bayru had been in office for only nine months, mirroring the fate of his predecessor Michel Barne, who resigned after just three months following a similar no\u2011confidence vote in December\u202f2024.

According to the vote, 364 members opposed the motion while 194 supported it, a result that \"did not secure a majority for B\u00e9ru\u2019s administration\".  President Emmanuel\u202fMacron is now faced with appointing a new prime minister within the next few days, as the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace has \"not ruled out\" a new election but prefers a swift appointment.  The crisis is linked to B\u00e9ru\u2019s fiscal plan, which proposed a \u20ac44\u202fbillion austerity package and the elimination of two public holidays to bring the 2026 deficit down to 4.6\u202f% of GDP.  France\u2019s 2024 deficit already stands at 5.8\u202f% of GDP, above the EU limit of 3\u202f%, and the country\u2019s debt is 114\u202f% of GDP, the third\u2011highest in the euro\u2011zone.  Macron\u2019s earlier decision to hold early parliamentary elections in 2022 is cited as a key factor that \"strengthened the far\u2011right\" and \"revitalised the left\", creating a \"floating parliament\".  The article quotes opposition figures: the National Rally\u2019s Marine Le\u202fPen says the only way to break the deadlock is to hold new elections, while left\u2011wing MP Mathilde\u202fPanot declares, \"We give Macron two choices: either accept impeachment or resign. We will also end the Fifth Republic.\"  The piece notes that the French constitution allows the president to dissolve the National Assembly and that Macron has \"little leverage\" left, as the political landscape has become highly fragmented.  Analysts suggest that Macron may either appoint a centrist, a left\u2011wing veteran, or a technocrat, but each option faces significant obstacles.  The article concludes that without a clear majority, France risks another early election or a prolonged governance crisis, and that the possibility of a Sixth Republic has been raised by some politicians.\n\nEvidence: 364\u2011194 vote result; 5.8\u202f% deficit; 114\u202f% debt; quotes from Le\u202fPen and Panot; reference to B\u00e9ru\u2019s \u20ac44\u202fbillion plan; mention of Macron\u2019s 2022 early election.\n\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 10:03 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8mVfbUnpOxm)\n\n**With French Government On The Brink, Macron's Room To Maneuver Is Limited**\nThe French National Assembly is set to vote on a confidence motion for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on September\u202f8, a defeat that would deepen political instability and curtail President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s options.  Bayrou, who opened the debate with a speech that day, faces opposition from all ten parliamentary groups, with the vote expected to conclude around 7\u202fp.m. Paris time.  Macron\u2019s snap election in 2024 has left the legislature fragmented, and the country is grappling with rising debt\u2014France\u2019s deficit is close to 6\u202f% of GDP, double the Eurozone ceiling\u2014and external pressures from the Ukraine war, a potential U.S. trade war, and China\u2019s rise.  If Bayrou loses, Macron is unlikely to call another snap election or resign; instead, he will likely appoint a new, more left\u2011leaning prime minister and push a budget with moderate cuts.  Nationwide strikes may follow, and Macron will focus on foreign policy, maintaining a vocal stance on Ukraine and the Middle East while avoiding large financial commitments.  The article notes that Macron\u2019s earlier decision to call parliamentary elections after a poor European Parliament result backfired, leaving his centrist \u201cEnsemble pour la R\u00e9publique\u201d weakened and the National Assembly dominated by Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally and a coalition of left\u2011wing parties.  Bayrou\u2019s attempt to cut 0.8\u202f% of GDP from the deficit\u2014already near 6\u202f%\u2014failed, and markets remain jittery.  Le Pen, barred from office after a conviction for EU fund misuse, is reportedly seeking early elections to challenge the Constitutional Council\u2019s ruling, which could allow her to run again in 2027.  The piece warns that a social\u2011media\u2011driven protest movement could either fizzle or drag on, risking an economic crisis.  Should Macron survive, he will return to the international stage, pursuing European leadership, a French seat at future Ukraine negotiations, and a \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism to re\u2011impose UN sanctions on Iran, while continuing to push for a Paris\u2011recognised Palestine at the UN General Assembly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 03:46 PM\nSource:[rferl.org](https://www.rferl.org/a/france-bayrou-confidence-vote-macron-political-crisis/33524817.html)\n\n**Could the French Government Fall Next Monday? Macron\u2019s Options**\nThe article examines the high probability that the French government, led by Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, will fall on Monday 8\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 after a confidence motion in the National Assembly. The opposition\u2014comprising the National Rally (RN) of Marine Le\u202fPen, the radical left France Insumisa (LFI), the Greens, the Communists and the Socialist Party\u2014has announced it will vote against Bayrou. A motion requires 289 of the 577 seats; the article notes that the arithmetic suggests the threshold is likely to be reached given widespread rejection of Bayrou\u2019s austerity plan, which proposes \u20ac44\u202fbillion in cuts and the elimination of two national holidays. If the motion passes, Bayrou and his cabinet must resign, and President Emmanuel Macron would need to appoint a new prime minister or, less likely, call early elections. The fragmented parliament, with no single bloc holding an absolute majority, would make forming a stable government difficult, potentially prolonging political uncertainty. The article also outlines potential economic consequences: the 2025 budget, which includes \u20ac44\u202fbillion cuts to meet EU deficit targets\u2014reducing the public deficit from 6\u202f% to 3\u202f% of GDP\u2014could be stalled, risking EU sanctions, market pressure and higher borrowing costs. Social unrest could intensify if austerity measures remain unchanged. The article notes that a snap election is unlikely because the constitution forbids elections before July\u202f2025, and polls suggest RN might gain ground while the Macronist Ensemble loses seats. The collapse would further weaken Macron\u2019s authority, whose term ends in 2027, and could empower far\u2011right forces ahead of the presidential election.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 03:45 AM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/internacional/puede-caer-gobierno-francia-proximo-lunes-estas-son-opciones-macron-15349161)\n\n**Voluntary Confinement Against Macron**\nAfter the June 2024 European Parliament elections, the National Rally (RN) topped the list, giving the left\u2011leaning New Popular Front a majority of almost 200 seats in the lower house, while the 125 RN deputies remain crucial for passing controversial laws and rejecting no\u2011confidence motions. The article criticises President Emmanuel Macron and his liberal prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou for failing to deliver promised reforms, citing Bayrou's \u20ac43.8\u202fbillion savings plan aimed at reducing the public deficit to 4.6\u202f% by 2026. It notes that Bayrou has not cut spending on international cooperation, party privileges, or bureaucracy. By September, the plan will face opposition from RN's Jordan Bardella and Jean\u2011Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who are preparing another no\u2011confidence motion that could succeed only with right\u2011wing support. The piece also describes a proposed voluntary lockdown starting 10\u202fSeptember, labelled 'Bloquons tout!', calling for school closures, travel bans, and a general strike. The author portrays the state as policing dissent, highlights the left's role as a safety valve, and laments the rise of far\u2011left agitators. The tone is strongly critical of Macron and supportive of leftist opposition, with frequent use of loaded language and rhetorical exaggeration. Evidence: the article states the RN topped the list and the New Popular Front holds almost 200 seats; it quotes 'El programa de reformas radicales que prometi\u00f3 aplicar Macron cuando gan\u00f3 las primeras elecciones presidenciales, en 2017, vuelve a avanzar a trancas y barrancas'; it cites the \u20ac43.8\u202fbillion savings plan (El plan de ahorro de 43.800 millones de euros) and the 4.6\u202f% deficit target; it mentions the 125 RN deputies; it refers to the proposed lockdown 'Bloquons tout!' and the date 10\u202fSeptember.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 04:12 PM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/opinion/confinamiento-voluntario-contra-macron-15283929)\n\n**Marine Le Pen Calls for Preparation for Possible Snap Elections in France**\nMarine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally party, has called on her supporters to prepare for possible snap parliamentary elections in France. Speaking at a rally of right-wing parties, she stated that 'it would be wrong to assume that dissolution is impossible'. Le Pen emphasized the need to be prepared for any uncertainty and announced that the deadline for waiting for the possible dissolution of parliament is July 7. She also noted that Macron's supporters are in a difficult situation, unable to continue existing in the face of internal conflict, which may prompt the president to dissolve parliament. Le Pen emphasized: 'His statement 'I do not want dissolution' does not guarantee that it will not happen'. Additionally, she highlighted the need for right-wing parties to actively prepare for municipal elections scheduled for the first half of 2026. In July 2024, Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly, initiating snap elections. As a result, the left-wing block won the majority of seats, surpassing the 'Together for the Republic' coalition, which secured 168 seats. The National Rally party, together with Republicans, took third place, winning 143 seats. Due to this, none of the political forces were able to form a majority government. As a result, France experienced a record four prime ministers in 2024.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 28, 2025 02:36 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/marin-le-pen-prizvala-gotovitsya-k-vozmozhnym-vyboram-vo-francii-652343.html)\n\n**France between the 2024 Crisis and a New Specter: The Nightmare of Early Elections**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly and hold early elections has led to a constitutional crisis and a fragmented parliament. The elections resulted in a parliament divided into three blocs: the far-right, the center, and the traditional right, and the left. As a result, Macron no longer has a majority to pass laws, and his government has lost its effective power. The first prime minister after the dissolution, Michel Barnier, failed to gain the confidence of the parliament and resigned in December 2024, to be replaced by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who is also struggling with a similar fragility and a threat of a vote of no confidence at the start of the next parliamentary session. A survey conducted by the Odysseus Institute for Le Figaro found that the majority of the French people view this decision negatively and do not want to repeat it before the 2027 legislative elections. According to the survey, 66% of the French people see this decision as 'a bad decision', despite a large number of them supporting it when it was announced in June 2024. The survey also found that 61% of the French people believe that the 'National Rally' party is the only one that has benefited from this election, while the other parties are seen as having been weakened. More than two-thirds of the French people (67%) believe that the President and the government have lost their political power due to this decision. In general, 62% of the French people believe that dissolving the National Assembly has had negative consequences for the country as a whole, leading 62% of them to reject any new dissolution before the next presidential election, reflecting a loss of trust in the executive's decisions and an increasing feeling that the political crisis has worsened rather than been resolved.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 07, 2025 02:24 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/france-macron-elections-parliamentf)\n\n",

    "summary": "Eight forecasting experts were asked whether French President Emmanuel Macron will call another snap legislative election before 2026, in the context of extreme parliamentary deadlock, rapid government turnover, and severe political instability following the 2024 snap elections. Virtually all experts agreed that, while extraordinary instability and deadlock make another dissolution more plausible than under normal circumstances, the probability remains well below even odds. Core reasons cited across perspectives include: (1) the historical rarity of repeat dissolutions in a single presidential term under the French Fifth Republic (no precedent of two within 18-24 months), (2) very strong political and public opposition\u2014polls show over 60% oppose a repeat and Macron\u2019s approval is at historic lows, (3) Macron\u2019s reluctance to risk a further political defeat after the 2024 call backfired, and (4) constitutional and strategic incentives to \u2018muddle through\u2019 with minority or technocratic governments, even at the cost of ongoing instability. Several experts noted that the only realistic scenario for a snap election would involve acute crisis: a complete government collapse, inability to pass a budget, protests escalating to destabilize the regime, or overwhelming external (EU/market) pressure. Still, most expected that Macron would exhaust all other options\u2014appointing new prime ministers, assembling ad hoc coalitions, relying on constitutional tools like Article 49.3\u2014before considering dissolution, given the political and reputational risks to himself and his party. Probability estimates ranged mostly between 8% and 32%, with a mean near 22%, reflecting higher-than-normal but still substantially less than 50% likelihood. Experts agreed that the unprecedented level of deadlock warrants an elevated (but not likely) risk of snap elections, with dissolution seen as a last resort if France reaches a true crisis of ungovernability before January 1, 2026.",
