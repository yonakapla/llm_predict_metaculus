However, three months still remain before the market\u2019s critical pricing window, and history suggests prediction markets tend to overreact near inflection points and adjust back towards a closer spread as uncertainty about the nomination process and unforeseen events are priced in. With no clear Democratic leader and continuing bad headlines, the modal expectation is for Kalshi traders to price the Republicans as equal or slight favorites. The risk of reversal or stabilization exists, but the status quo is negative for Democrats. Blending these factors, a forecast of 24% reflects a modest but clear likelihood that Democratic contracts will be above Republican ones on Kalshi at year\u2019s end, but recognizes Republican-favored sentiment is currently ascendant.",

Prediction markets\u2014Kalshi included\u2014are structurally pro-GOP right now due to recency bias, lack of Democratic momentum, and genuine issue ownership. Markets tend to price in status quo momentum and are unlikely to grant Dems a price premium barring a sharp and credible shift in perceived fundamentals or candidate viability. Conversely, mean reversion, chance exogenous shocks, or premature GOP complacency could buoy Dem prices, but no such trend appears imminent as of September 2025. The chance that Kalshi's median price for the Democratic party surpasses the Republican median at year-end is thus considerably below 50%, but not vanishingly small given the long time horizon and potential for volatility and market mean reversion.

Financial prediction markets like Kalshi are surprisingly efficient over the medium run, especially with substantial volume, but noise and inertia remain\u2014particularly if market catalysts (such as dramatic primary developments or economic shocks) are lacking in the next few months. The status quo is Democrats slightly favored (per direct market odds), but trend and newsflow is negative for them: Republicans dominate on key issues and national favorability is low for leading Dems. Meanwhile, minor market inefficiencies are unlikely to flip the sign except if prices are truly razor-close. Arithmetic base rates (from similar post-election cycles) suggest that three years out, prediction markets with a sitting party in power (Democrats) often 'artificially' anchor them as early favorites, but negative performance and lack of clear nominee depress these odds quickly, as has begun to occur post-2024. Unless there\u2019s a catalyzing event or unexpected surge for the Dems, price action is more likely to shift towards parity or Republican favoritism by end-December. Given this, and the risk that even an exact tie resolves as No, the fair forecast should overweight the negative factors: the current 24% captures the likelihood that either the market shifts very slightly against the Dems (>50% for GOP or a tie), or that minor structural drag and newsflow continue to wear down the Democratic contract bid.",

From a market microstructure perspective, systematic negative framing and constant news emphasizing Democratic disarray and Republican strength don't just reflect surface-level signals; they set a powerful informational environment in which liquidity providers, arbitrageurs, and retail traders anchor their valuations. Given the efficiency of high-volume markets like Kalshi (with limited scope for sustained mispricing), the negative agenda powerfully reinforces inertia and makes a price-flipping scenario for Democrats unlikely without a seismic news event. Your skepticism about a major frame break is well-founded: evidence from recent cycles shows agenda inertia limits even significant late reversals from translating quickly into market favorite status. Your sub-25% probability is highly defensible when viewed through the lens of both media studies and microstructure analysis."

In long-dated markets like Kalshi\u2019s presidential contract, traders will often start factoring in the potential for mean reversion or the drawing of new candidates\u2014especially as term-limited incumbency forecloses a Trump candidacy and increases uncertainty for both parties. While it\u2019s very likely retrospective disappointment for Democrats and lack of clear leadership continues to weigh on prices, the relatively distant resolution date (three months) plus the unpredictability of early 2028 cycle dynamics leaves enough room that a slight over-reliance on backward-looking fundamentals could miss an emerging bid for Democratic contracts if unforeseen positive developments or major GOP missteps appear. A slightly broader view of forward-looking and contrarian market tendencies (even as small as they are) may warrant greater discussion, especially when pricing scenarios can flip on thin margins."

By emphasizing that mean reversion and volatility are possible but insufficient forces to overcome entrenched narrative and party performance signals by late 2025, you make a strong case for keeping the probability notably below 50%. This is supported by both election history and empirical prediction market behavior, where deeply out-of-power parties rarely regain market favoritism so soon barring an obvious candidate or unexpected exogenous shock.

From the Median Voter Theorem perspective, while party repositioning should occur in response to losses, such adaptation is usually gradual and filtered through the lens of existing party identities. Your analysis accurately points out that party identification theory expects aversive attitudes and negative brand impressions to remain sticky for several cycles, especially after a widely covered realignment. This inertia, compounded by a lack of a charismatic new Democratic leader, dampens the likelihood of median voter recalibration changing market sentiment quickly. Thus, your sub-25% assessment is well supported by both structural partisan loyalty frameworks and the empirical stickiness observed in public opinion and market sentiment, even as new election cycles begin."

This can temporarily advantage the less-favored contract during lulls or on the basis of small positive sentiment shocks, particularly given the proximity of Democratic and Republican odds in recent cycles. Accounting for this noise, as well as the chance for narrative 'mini-rebounds,' could marginally increase the estimated probability of a Yes outcome, even if the underlying fundamentals are adverse for Democrats.

The absence of a compelling Democratic narrative or leader, as you highlight, anchors the existing market consensus in favor of the Republicans. You also take appropriate account of the fact that, historically, such framing rarely flips without a clear, highly visible catalyst\u2014especially given the empirical stickiness evident in both prediction markets and partisan attachments.

I agree that while prediction markets price forward-looking scenarios, they do so by heavily weighting current fundamental and reputational signals, as is currently the case for the Democrats.

This matches the expectations of rational actors responding not just to polling and macro signals, but to micro-level incentives\u2014such as instant profit in the event of inefficient spreads. You also appropriately note that structural stickiness and technical market measurement (e.g., median pricing) work against the Democrats flipping to favorite on a brief emotional impulse. In all of this, your analysis conveys why, even if a pro-Democrat shock occurs, it would need to be pronounced and sustained\u2014both in trading flow and information salience\u2014to overcome market inertia, especially given the mechanical tie-break criteria.

Additionally, your reliance on base rates and informational efficiency mirrors framing's caution against overestimating rapid sentiment reversals.

The poll found Trump has 42\u202f% support on immigration, higher than former President Joe Biden\u2019s 26\u202f% (Reuters poll December\u202f2024). For a brief period (late February\u2011early March), 50\u202f% of Americans approved of Trump\u2019s mass\u2011deportation policies. Trump\u2019s overall approval on the economy is 35\u202f%, slightly below Biden\u2019s 34\u202f% (December\u202f2024). The poll also shows Trump and Republicans are more trusted than Democrats on most key issues, with 54\u202f% of respondents saying the economy is on the wrong track, up from 52\u202f% in July. Former White House strategist Alyssa Farah Griffin is quoted: 'I think if the election were re\u2011held today, Donald Trump would win by the same if not a bigger margin.'

She cited a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found 40% of voters trust Republicans to handle crime and immigration, compared with 20% for Democrats and 22% for Democrats on those issues. The poll also showed Republicans leading Democrats on foreign conflicts, the economy, gun control and political extremism, while Democrats had a plurality on respect for democracy, healthcare, the environment and women's rights. Another Ipsos/Washington Post poll reported Republicans ahead by 7% on the economy, 13% on immigration and 22% on crime, suggesting potential trouble for Democrats in the 2026 midterms. Griffin\u2019s remarks were met with audible groans from the audience and a sharp retort from co\u2011host Joy Behar.

I think if the election were re\u2011held today, Donald Trump would win by the same if not a bigger margin,' and her follow\u2011up: 'This country is so deeply polarized, if you hated [Trump] before, you hate him even more now.' The piece also notes exit polling from November 2024, where Trump secured every swing state, became the first Republican nominee in 20 years to win the popular vote, and made significant gains among Hispanic and blue\u2011collar voters, including the first Republican to win the Hispanic male vote.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[The Western Journal](https://www.westernjournal.com/view-co-host-triggers-panel-saying-trump-win-bigger-margin-2024-election-held-now/)\n\n**'View' crowd groans at Alyssa Farah Griffin's unsettling Donald Trump projection**\nOn September 26, 2025, ABC\u2019s talk show The View featured former Trump staffer Alyssa Farah Griffin, who sparked a heated debate by predicting that Donald Trump would win a re\u2011held election by a similar or larger margin.

Griffin countered Behar\u2019s point about democracy, saying, 'I think that people throw around the term 'democracy.' I think Democrats totally over\u2011calculated this last election at the end of the day.' Ana Navarro added that voters had 'forgotten how bad Trump was' when re\u2011electing him.

Prediction markets show a 43% chance of a shutdown before year\u2011end, with over $1.2\u202fmillion wagered on the outcome. The uncertainty has already triggered a sharp sell\u2011off: Bitcoin fell 5.73% from about $104,000 to $96,522, Ethereum dropped 9.85% to $3,511, and Solana plunged 13% to $196, wiping more than $1.1\u202fbillion in market value. The decline continued throughout the week, with Ethereum breaking below $4,000 for the first time since August and the broader market erasing over $140\u202fbillion in value. Current prices show a modest rebound\u2014Ethereum at $4,018 and Bitcoin at $109,568\u2014yet both remain below recent peaks, with Bitcoin\u2019s all\u2011time high of $115,970 reached on September\u202f14,\u202f2025.\n\nA shutdown would reduce the SEC\u2019s staff to 10% of normal, limiting regulatory action on crypto. This could delay ETF approvals and new rule proposals, even though the SEC and CFTC recently issued joint guidance permitting spot crypto trading on registered exchanges. \"A shutdown would stall critical progress on crypto policy,\" said Jessica Martinez of the Blockchain Association.\n\nHistorical context shows that the 2018\u20112019 shutdown (35\u202fdays) delayed crypto approvals, and each week of closure typically costs the U.S. economy about $7\u202fbillion. The crypto market, valued at over $2\u202ftrillion globally, could face significant disruption. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand warned, \"I don't want to put an artificial deadline on anything,\" highlighting the prioritisation of budget battles over crypto legislation. Despite these risks, industry leaders remain optimistic, noting bipartisan support for crypto regulation.\n\nThe article concludes that while a shutdown would not cause permanent damage, it would create uncertainty and delay regulatory progress for months, underscoring the crypto market\u2019s dependence on traditional government decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 09:30 PM\nSource:[Brave New Coin](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/government-shutdown-threatens-crypto-markets-as-political-deadlock-intensifies)\n\n**Trump's No.1 policy that Republicans can ride into 2028 election**\nPresident Donald Trump should further emphasize immigration to position Republicans for a 2028 win, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,016 Americans surveyed from September\u202f19\u201121.

While some view the correction as a buying opportunity, others fear the rally may have ended. Eric Trump, son of the U.S. president, remains optimistic, claiming Bitcoin could soon exceed $1\u202fmillion and that Ethereum also holds promise. He has previously advised buying Ethereum at $3,500, a recommendation that was followed by a price drop, suggesting his forecasts should be treated as sentiment indicators rather than reliable trading signals. The piece notes that the fourth quarter has historically been the strongest period for Bitcoin, supporting the idea that a rally could continue. Critics point to the well\u2011known four\u2011year cycle that would predict an imminent peak, but many analysts argue that institutional adoption has overridden these cycles, potentially allowing growth into 2025 and 2026. The article also highlights the altcoin Snorter ($SNORT), which has attracted attention for its meme\u2011coin hype combined with practical features such as a Telegram\u2011integrated trading bot, sniper, copy\u2011trading, stop\u2011loss, take\u2011profit, and smart\u2011contract scanning to guard against rug pulls. The $SNORT token is currently in pre\u2011sale, with over $4\u202fmillion already invested before any exchange listing, and analysts expect it to surge post\u2011launch.

In some markets the prices of 'Yes' and 'No' shares did not sum to one dollar, creating an immediate profit opportunity.  In other cases, logically linked markets such as \"Trump wins the presidency\" versus \"Republican wins the presidency\" were priced differently, enabling traders to lock in gains regardless of the outcome.  The study estimates that arbitrageurs have already extracted more than $40\u202fmillion from Polymarket, and it identified over 7,000 markets with measurable mispricing, many of which are highly liquid.  The authors note, 'Prediction markets are often treated as if they represent the collective intelligence of the crowd,' and add, 'But our results show they can deviate significantly from probabilistic consistency, even in markets with substantial trading activity.'  The paper argues that such inefficiencies are not unique to Polymarket; any platform that permits continuous, peer\u2011to\u2011peer trading of outcome tokens\u2014whether on crypto rails like Polymarket and Myriad or in regulated venues such as Kalshi\u2014is subject to the same structural forces.

Polymarket\u2019s CEO, Shayne Coplan, described the regulatory progress as a \u2018record\u2011timing\u2019 achievement after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a no\u2011action letter easing reporting requirements and after the company acquired the Florida\u2011based derivatives exchange QCX for about $112\u202fmillion.  The platform\u2019s success in the 2024 U.S. presidential election\u2014correctly predicting Donald Trump\u2019s victory and processing over $8\u202fbillion in bets\u2014has driven a surge in monthly active traders.

Kalshi\u2019s markets recorded $441\u202fmillion in volume during the NFL\u2019s opening week in September\u202f2025, a figure the CEO, Tarek Mansour, likened to the intensity of a national election.  Both firms are positioned within a broader renaissance of prediction markets, with 2025 seeing over $216\u202fmillion invested across 11 deals\u2014triple the previous year\u2019s total\u2014while firms such as Coinbase and Crypto.com enter the space.  The article emphasizes that regulatory stability and user adoption will be key to these platforms\u2019 continued growth, but the current investor enthusiasm signals a potential shift toward mainstream acceptance of prediction markets as tools for gauging public sentiment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[Crowdfund Insider](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2025/09/251243-prediction-markets-polymarket-and-kalshi-may-target-higher-valuations-via-potential-funding-rounds/)\n\n**Polymarket Reportedly Targets Fall U.S. Launch, Football Trading**\nPolymarket, a crypto\u2011based prediction\u2011market platform, is preparing a fall 2025 launch in the United States after a three\u2011year hiatus. The company is advertising on Meta\u2011owned Facebook and Instagram, and one ad targets Texas residents with a promotion for 'legal football trading', a feature that would compete with established sportsbooks such as FanDuel and DraftKings and with other prediction markets like Kalshi. The NFL remains the most popular betting sport, generating billions of dollars in wagers during the second half of the year. Sports betting is legal in 38 U.S. states, with Missouri set to bring the total to 39 when wagering begins on Dec.\u202f1. Flutter, owner of FanDuel, has said that prediction markets have not affected its sportsbook in jurisdictions where it operates. Kalshi has offered 'Yes' and 'No' contracts on game outcomes since the Super Bowl in February, and has recently added NFL and college\u2011football markets with spreads and totals. FanDuel announced a partnership with CME Group that will allow it to offer financial prediction markets to its customers, though it has not indicated plans to offer sports\u2011outcome contracts. Polymarket, which was blocked from offering event trading in 2022 by the CFTC, acquired the federally regulated derivatives exchange QCEX for $112\u202fmillion in July, potentially enabling it to introduce sports contracts in the U.S. market. SimilarWeb data from May\u202f2025 show the platform had 15.9\u202fmillion visits, surpassing FanDuel and DraftKings, and it boasts a 94\u202f% accuracy rate in forecasting. Founded in 2020, Polymarket raised $200\u202fmillion earlier this year, pushing its valuation above $1\u202fbillion. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election, more than $3\u202fbillion in contracts were traded on the site. The company now faces a controversial landscape, as Kalshi, which gained traction during last year\u2019s election after a court ruling, is embroiled in legal disputes with several states over sports\u2011outcome contracts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 21, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/report-polymarket-targets-fall-us-launch-football-trading-aug-21-2025)\n\n**Polymarket Users Predict 2028 US Presidential Election Outcomes**\nAccording to the Polymarket platform, 56% of users believe that current Vice President JD Vance will be the Republican Party's candidate for the 2028 US presidential election. Marco Rubio, the current Secretary of State, is in second place with 7% of users making bets on him. Meanwhile, 5% of users think that former President Donald Trump will win the primaries, despite being ineligible for a third term. In the Democratic Party, Governor of California Gavin Newsom is the front-runner with 21% of users making bets on him. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is in second place with 16% of users, followed by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg with 12% of users. In terms of the election outcome, 28% of users believe that Vance will win, followed by Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez with 14% and 11% respectively. However, a separate market on the platform shows that 55% of users believe that the Democratic Party will win the election, while 46% think that the Republican Party will win.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: August 06, 2025 01:23 PM\nSource:[\u041e\u0411\u041e\u0417\u0420\u0415\u0412\u0410\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c](https://finance.obozrevatel.com/tramp-proletaet-na-kogo-stavyat-bukmekeryi-na-vyiborah-prezidenta-ssha-v-2028-godu.htm)\n\n**2028 Election Odds Out From Polymarket: Vance Tops List At 27%, Trump Has 5%, Here's What Voters Say In New Poll**\nPrediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi have released odds for the 2028 presidential election. According to Polymarket, Vice President J.D. Vance is the current frontrunner with 27% of the vote, followed by California Governor Gavin Newsom with 15%. Former President Donald Trump has 5% of the vote, despite not being constitutionally able to run for the election. A new poll by Echelon Insights found that Vance is the top Republican candidate with 42% of the vote, while Kamala Harris leads the Democratic primary with 26%. However, the poll and prediction markets differ, with prediction markets pricing in Harris not running or placing her odds of winning the election extremely low. Vance dominates both the polls and prediction markets, but a large number of bets are coming in on Trump, with some bettors predicting he could end up being allowed to run.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 20, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/news/politics/25/07/46510082/2028-election-odds-out-from-polymarket-vance-tops-list-at-27-trump-has-5-heres-what-voters-say-in-new-poll)\n\n**Vance, Buttigieg Top 2028 Election Poll, Plus Betting Odds - USData (OTC:USDC)**\nA new 2028 presidential election poll shows a mix of candidates for both the Republican and Democratic parties.

Betting odds from BetMGM and Kalshi show Vance as the Republican frontrunner, while Buttigieg and Harris are priced lower than other Democratic candidates.

In contrast to the 2024 presidential election, where traders gave Trump a higher chance of winning than polls suggested, the mayoral election market on Kalshi was more accurate. Brad Tusk, managing partner at Tusk Venture Partners, noted that the correlation between bettors and voters was high in the presidential race, but there was less information available for the mayoral primary, which may have contributed to the accuracy of the prediction markets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 25, 2025 09:33 PM\nSource:[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/25/zohran-mamdani-nyc-primary-prediction-markets)\n\n**Wetten auf Trag\u00f6dien: The Ethics of Prediction Markets**\nPlatforms like Polymarket and Kalshi allow users to bet on global events in cryptocurrencies. Polymarket gained fame when it correctly predicted the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election. However, these prediction markets are banned in Switzerland, Belgium, and Thailand as they are considered illegal gambling. Experts warn that these platforms turn human tragedies into a game. For example, when the 'Titan' submarine with five passengers on board went missing in June 2023, users bet $300,000 on their fate, with some winning up to $8,000. Julien Pillot, a doctor of economics at the University of Nice, says that these platforms raise questions about the 'monetization of reality' and 'gamification.' Dominique Boullier, a sociologist at Sciences Po Paris, warns that these bets are not opinion polls and lack an ethical code and control. He suggests that the media should ignore these cases as they do not influence public debate. However, studies have shown that these bets can influence elections, creating an 'oracle effect.' A case in point is the 2024 Romanian presidential election, where an anonymous investor spent over $2.5 million to influence the popularity of George Simion on Polymarket. Alexandru Leca, a Romanian computer scientist, revealed that an algorithm was used to maintain Simion's rating by placing thousands of orders. 'It's a form of manipulation where the rating of a candidate is artificially maintained by placing tens of thousands of orders,' Leca said.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: June 09, 2025 06:17 AM\nSource:[SRF News](https://www.srf.ch/news/dialog/polymarket-und-co-wetten-auf-tragoedien-wie-wettplattformen-die-ethik-herausfordern)\n\n**Trump Claims Victory Over Harris In US Presidential Election | HowAfrica Latest news, views, gossip, photos and video**\nDonald Trump claimed victory over Kamala Harris in the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, declaring that he would \"help our country heal,\" according to a speech he gave at his Florida headquarters with his wife Melania and several children present.  Only Fox News had called the race for Trump at the time of the report, while other networks had not yet made a call.  Trump\u2019s supporters cheered and chanted \"USA\" as he spoke, and he noted that \"US networks have called the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina for the 78\u2011year\u2011old,\" while the other states had not yet been called.  The article also reports that Trump\u2019s Republican Party seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats and overturning a narrow Democratic majority.  Markets reacted positively: the U.S. dollar surged, bitcoin hit a record high, and most equity markets advanced as traders bet on a Trump win.  The piece highlights the political tension, noting that the FBI said bomb threats at polling stations in Georgia and Pennsylvania appeared to originate in Russia, though the threats were later deemed hoaxes.  Trump\u2019s campaign was bolstered by a post from Elon Musk, who said \"Game, set and match\" on X.  The article describes Trump\u2019s pledge to cut aid to Kyiv and to launch an unprecedented deportation campaign of millions of undocumented immigrants, and it mentions his criminal case over hush\u2011money payments and his denial of the 2020 election defeat.  Quotes from the article include: \"We are going to help our country heal,\" and \"You won\u2019t hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from her tomorrow,\" said Cedric Richmond, Harris campaign co\u2011chair.  The report presents the events with sensational language, emphasizing dramatic reactions and political implications.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 08:56 AM\nSource:[howafrica.com](https://howafrica.com/trump-claims-victory-over-harris-in-us-presidential-election/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts across diverse academic and forecasting perspectives (election forecasting, financial markets, political science, economics, and communication studies) independently converge on a 24% probability that Democrats will be favored to win the 2028 US presidential election in the last week of 2025 according to Kalshi\u2019s prediction market. Their consensus is grounded in a shared assessment of recent political developments: following the decisive Republican victory in the 2024 presidential election and GOP momentum on key issues (economy, immigration, crime), Democrats are perceived as divided and lacking a clear, popular standard-bearer. While Kalshi and comparable markets showed a narrow Democratic edge around mid-2025 (about 52\u201355%), recent polling, negative media framing, and expert interpretation strongly suggest that market sentiment has since shifted against the Democrats. Experts emphasize that prediction markets are efficient and sensitive to informed trader behavior and prevailing news, meaning that absent a major positive shock for Democrats or a negative event for Republicans, continued negative fundamentals and narratives will likely suppress Democratic contract prices through the end of 2025.\n\nAll experts note some modest potential for mean-reversion, unexpected exogenous shocks, or contrarian market behavior that could briefly lift Democrats back above Republicans in Kalshi\u2019s weeklong median price measure\u2014justifying a nonzero, but low, forecast. However, the prevailing view is that prediction market pricing will reflect current party weaknesses, the inertia of public narrative, and the aftermath of the 2024 realignment, with little convincing evidence for an imminent Democratic revival before the year's end. Consequently, every expert (regardless of theoretical orientation) arrives at a 24% probability, highlighting robust inter-forecaster agreement around the scenario's strong, but not absolute, Republican market advantage at the designated time.",
