The President is escalating, not deescalating, by preparing permanent layoffs and refusing to negotiate. There is less 'wiggle-room' than in ordinary cycles, and the narratives of blame are already being set for public consumption\u2014a sign neither expects to avoid a shutdown. While there is always a non-zero possibility of a last-hour climbdown, the historical track record and the specific cues from party leadership, plus the shift in shutdown-negotiation dynamics (with Democrats now extracting demands), all strongly favor at least a brief shutdown.

Several news articles confirm that both chambers are in recess, further shrinking the time window for a rescue vote. GOP leadership has signaled little interest in a real negotiation, and the White House is telegraphing a willingness to accept or even welcome a shutdown. The one meaningful contravening consideration is the political and economic cost of shutdowns, which historically has triggered last-second surrenders.

Historically, even in highly polarized cycles, Congress has managed extremely rapid, last-hour agreements when facing imminent government disruption and public backlash, as a sort of institutional muscle-memory. Incrementalism typically asserts that systems, even under stress, seek the familiar and avoid large discontinuities. By stating that incremental approaches are 'very likely to break down' with only procedural hurdles, the forecast may marginally overstate the certainty\u2014even if the practical effect is negligible for this situation. A more nuanced incrementalist approach would account for the persistent though small probability that, at literally the last moment, practical legislative actors will create a patch, acknowledging history's handful of near-miraculous saves. Still, the overall forecast is strong for this specific case, given that almost all signals favor a shutdown, but the justification could more clearly recognize why incrementalism sometimes (though rarely) prevails even in severe brinkmanship."

Where some analyses might overstate the potential for a surprise bipartisan resolution, this forecast places the base rate of shutdowns during comparable impasses front and center\u2014a key move in appropriations-cycle analysis. Furthermore, the recognition that the 'modal outcome' in such standoffs is a brief technical shutdown, not a miraculous last-minute save, is exactly right in this context; the time lost to procedural inertia and the complexity of capitulating after maximalist rhetoric often means you cannot prevent a technical shutdown even when a face-saving deal is struck hours or days later. This analysis also wisely notes that the window for rescue is tiny, and the process machinery of government cannot always turn fast enough, even if last-minute agreement emerges among leaders. Thus, this forecast expresses the razor-thin uncertainty remaining in a manner that is both realistic and grounded in historical appropriations cycle precedents, making it a compelling and defensible assessment."

The analysis appreciates that, even if the political will to avoid a shutdown materializes in the final hours, the appropriations machinery of Congress is rarely equipped to operationalize a solution at that speed\u2014particularly when both chambers are out of session until the immediate eve of the deadline. The forecast also correctly notes that mutual escalation and hardened public positions eliminate easy off-ramps for either side, thereby significantly increasing the statistical likelihood of at least a brief lapse in funding, which is consistent with recent US budget process history. The assessment's recognition that shutdowns are not the result of one single variable but instead the compound effect of procedural, political, and institutional rigidities, is entirely sound. The only possible area for marginal improvement would be to quantify how fleeting market/public pressure sometimes produces lightning-quick deals, but as a shutdown probability forecast, the argument is cogent and well-supported by process model logic."

By focusing on the hardening of party positions, mutual perceptions of blame, and the lack of incentives for conciliation at the institutional level, it provides a valuable theoretical lens. The reference to the escalating frequency and duration of recent shutdowns is particularly salient, strengthening the argument that the modern Congressional context is more favorable than ever to shutdown as an outcome of legislative impasse. Notably, the forecast appropriately cautions that, despite the high likelihood, some uncertainty remains due to the unpredictability of brinksmanship\u2014a nuance often lost in highly polarized models. This focus on both institutional incentives and the empirics of recent history makes the analysis robust and compatible with legislative impasse evaluation, as it demonstrates how extreme polarization itself often renders procedural obstacles insurmountable until the consequences of inaction are directly felt."

The focus on how both sides are already preparing narratives and consequences, and the recognition that no \"wiggle room\" exists given public positions and the mechanics of appropriation, are especially compelling. Additionally, the mention of the dynamics shifting\u2014Democrats as the party leveraging the deadline, a notable and atypical condition\u2014demonstrates an awareness of subtle process flips that could confound naive analogies with earlier shutdowns. The forecast does well to frame the last-minute patch as statistically less likely than a technical shutdown, which is borne out by historical precedent when deadlines are breached with this little runway. Altogether, this defense holds that appropriations-cycle logic justifies both the extremely high probability and the marginal but real residual chance of a last-gasp agreement."

There have been instances\u2014rare, but significant\u2014where Congressional leaders or a bipartisan coalition have made lightning-fast procedural maneuvers (sometimes after the official deadline, but before OPM implements furloughs) to forestall a full practical shutdown. Though current signals overwhelmingly support the shutdown thesis, the federal system and its multifaceted layers do sometimes produce tactical backchannels obscured from public view. Thus, while the forecast's near-certainty is justified by present evidence, it could more explicitly acknowledge the rare but real possibility that federalist complexity and institutional adaptability may facilitate an extremely late rescue, even when, by most observable signals, resolution appears all but foreclosed."

This analysis correctly weighs the confluence of factors\u2014public negotiations breaking down, White House escalation, mutual blame games, and the logistical inertia created by scattered chamber schedules\u2014all of which robustly heighten the probability of a shutdown past the modern historical norm. Importantly, the forecast remains appropriately probabilistic: it doesn't simply assert inevitability, but retains a sliver of uncertainty for a last-gasp, market- or pressure-driven deal, mirroring the base rate of near-miss resolutions in the record. In terms of public administration best practices, the synthesis of procedural, behavioral, and historical inputs demonstrates excellent risk analysis rigor suited for this level of institutional crisis."

By highlighting the interplay between escalating rhetoric, procedural barriers, and the timing crunch resulting from Congressional recesses, it demonstrates why incremental, last-second deals are much less likely in this environment. The explicit recognition of Trump and Democrat messaging strategies, and the absence of serious compromise signals, goes beyond abstract process and reflects current reality. Importantly, while acknowledging the standard caveat that brinkmanship sometimes ends with an extraordinary late deal, the forecast does not over-value this small residual chance\u2014consistently with both the historical record and the current impasse indicators. In terms of incrementalism, this approach accurately notes how institutional routines and 'muscle-memory' can fail when political incentives for conflict override the usual avoidance of large discontinuities. While some incrementalists may argue for leaving a larger probability window for a miracle CR, the track record and current factors justly override that, making this a robust and defensible forecast."

Incremental solutions do sometimes prevail even in polarized crises, but this is usually the result of sudden coordination among leaders swayed by external shocks, not merely the byproduct of failed routine. Here, the evidence is unusually strong that neither side has created substantive groundwork for even an incremental, status-quo-preserving patch. Furthermore, by emphasizing procedural inertia as almost dispositive, the forecast could risk obscuring the importance of overt political choice and incentive\u2014Congress and the White House have options to expedite compromise if they choose, but current political logic makes those options disfavored. In sum, the model could be strengthened by integrating a sharper distinction between routine institutional inertia and the explicit, strategic weaponization of deadlines\u2014an abnormal context incrementalism alone cannot always explain."

The House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, introduced a provisional bill to extend federal funding until 21 November, but the Senate, dominated by Democrats, has refused to approve it unless both parties negotiate an extension for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that are about to expire. If the impasse is not resolved, the federal government will lack money to pay salaries for non\u2011essential employees. A memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2013 obtained by Pol\u00edtico before its official release \u2013 instructs agencies to identify programs that will be unfunded on 1 October and have no alternative funding; positions not aligned with President Trump\u2019s priorities will be permanently eliminated, a practice referred to as 'RIF' (Reduction in Force). The OMB official also listed programs that will continue after a shutdown: Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, military operations, law enforcement, ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and air traffic control. According to NBC News, the Senate requires 60 votes to pass a funding measure; Republicans currently hold 53 votes and need seven Democratic votes to reach the threshold. The last shutdown confrontation in March ended when Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer conceded, allowing a spending bill to pass. Pol\u00edtico reports that Schumer said the shutdown would be a 'gift' to Trump and his allies, enabling them to 'destruir servicios gubernamentales vitales m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido'.

According to the OMB, the cuts will target programs that are not funded by mandatory appropriations and are deemed 'inconsistent with the President\u2019s priorities'. The document cited by Politico and the New\u202fYork\u202fTimes indicates that programs funded by mandatory appropriations\u2014such as Social Security, Medicare, veterans\u2019 benefits, military operations, law\u2011enforcement and air\u2011traffic control\u2014would be exempt. The OMB warns that the reductions would become permanent, creating a lasting structural impact on public employment. Politically, the move is viewed as a bargaining tool: Republicans control both chambers but need at least seven Democratic votes in the Senate to pass a spending plan. The current Republican proposal provides a temporary funding extension until the end of November, while Democrats are demanding the restoration of hundreds of billions of dollars in health\u2011care spending. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the tactic as 'an intimidation attempt', saying Trump is \"not trying to govern, but to instill fear\". If Congress fails to reach an agreement by the deadline, the consequences could be significant: hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed or laid off, essential services would be suspended, and market confidence could suffer.

House Appropriations Chair Rosa\u202fDeLauro said there is still time to negotiate a continuing resolution, while Wisconsin Sen. Tammy\u202fBaldwin advocated extending health\u2011care tax credits.

The standoff centers on healthcare and Medicaid cuts. The House approved a Republican short\u2011term measure to keep the government funded into November, but the bill failed in the Senate, where a 60\u2011vote threshold is required for passage. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sent a letter to President Donald Trump demanding a meeting to prevent a shutdown. They wrote, 'At your direction, Republican congressional leaders have repeatedly and publicly refused to engage in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government open.' Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman was the only Democrat to vote for the Republican bill in the House, highlighting intraparty divisions. Trump warned that a government closure could occur, though essential payments such as Social Security and military pay would continue. Schumer and Jeffries countered, 'With the September 30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats.' Negotiations are expected to intensify as both parties weigh the political and economic costs of a potential shutdown, with healthcare funding remaining at the center of the debate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 03:08 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-government-faces-september-30-shutdown-deadline-democrats-push-healthcare-protections-amid-funding-standoff-11758552748146.html)\n\n**'My brain's falling out of my head': GOP stunned by 'weird' Dem maneuver in budget fight**\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D\u2011NY) spoke at a press conference on June\u202f10\u202f2025, as the deadline to pass a spending bill before the start of fiscal year\u202f2026 (Oct\u202f1) approaches. The article reports that if Congress fails to adopt a bill by that date, the federal government would shut down. Traditionally, a standoff leads Democrats to push for a continuing resolution (CR) to keep funding at current levels. In this case, Republicans are pushing for a CR while Democrats demand budget concessions, a reversal that surprised GOP lawmakers. Rep. Rich McCormick (R\u2011GA) said, 'My brain's falling out of my head,' after learning that the Freedom Caucus is supporting a CR while Democrats threaten a shutdown. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D\u2011MD) said, 'Everything they're doing is designed to protect their dismantling of Medicaid and the health care system, and we made a very emphatic statement that we are going to stand strong.' A House Republican, speaking anonymously, described the situation as 'the Twilight Zone.' President Donald Trump has criticized Democrats for refusing a CR, accusing them of wanting to 'shut down the country,' but critics note he still needs Democratic votes to avoid a shutdown. Sen. Mark Warner (D\u2011VA) said, 'I know the president may not want to acknowledge checks and balances, [but] he can't do this with Republican\u2011only votes.' The article also notes that the Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire this year, a point that has divided the GOP and could become a political liability in the upcoming midterm elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:50 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/government-2674015847/)\n\n**Tables turn for Democrats as they use shutdown for leverage**\nThe U.S. Congress is approaching a potential government shutdown on Oct.\u202f1, 2025, with the parties\u2019 roles reversed from past crises. Republicans are pushing a \"clean\" seven\u2011week continuing resolution (CR) to buy time for negotiations, while Democrats have drafted a four\u2011week shutdown plan that adds demands such as a permanent extension of health\u2011insurance subsidies.  Rep. Rich McCormick (R\u2011Ga.) remarked, 'My brain's falling out of my head,' to describe the oddness of the current standoff.  House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R\u2011Okla.) recalled the 2013 shutdown, noting, 'They tied something unrelated to spending, Obamacare, and shut down the government,' and said it was a mistake.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer countered, 'What's different? They were taking something away. We're trying to restore something that they took away.'  Democrats argue that the GOP\u2019s strategy is a tactic to reverse health\u2011care provisions and cut Medicaid, with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D\u2011Md.) stating, 'Everything they're doing is designed to protect their dismantling of Medicaid and the health care system.'  Rep. Mike Levin (D\u2011Calif.) warned, 'There's nothing clean about the administration undermining Congress.'  Senator Mark Warner (D\u2011Va.) warned that a shutdown could leave 17\u202fmillion Americans without health insurance, saying, 'I know the president may not want to acknowledge checks and balances, but he can't do this with Republican\u2011only votes.'  Trump\u2019s comments that Republicans should not engage with Democrats have further inflamed tensions, with Rep. Bennie Thompson (D\u2011Miss.) noting, 'Donald Trump told them, 'Don't talk to the Democrats,' and so they didn't.'  The article presents the facts and statements from both sides without overt editorializing, offering a balanced view of the current budget impasse.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 08:45 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/tables-turn-democrats-shutdown-leverage-084500112.html)\n\n**US rolls toward a 'terrible' government shutdown, no exit ramp in sight \u2022 Tennessee Lookout**\nThe article reports a deadlock on Capitol Hill over whether to fund the federal government for a seven\u2011week temporary period or to allow a shutdown that could last longer.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who had earlier urged a short\u2011term funding patch, has now said Democrats will not support a seven\u2011week stopgap ahead of the Oct.\u202f1 shutdown deadline, arguing that Republicans cannot shut Democrats out of the process.  Republicans hold majorities in both chambers but need at least 60 votes in the Senate to pass a funding bill, forcing bipartisan cooperation.  The piece cites the last two shutdowns, noting they produced no policy wins, and quotes several lawmakers:  Schumer said, \u2018President Trump and Republican leaders would like nothing more than to pull us into the mud of a protracted government shutdown.\u2019  West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito called a shutdown a \u2018fool\u2019s errand\u2019 and said it was unfair to the American people.  Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy warned that Trump would have \u2018pretty much unfettered discretion\u2019 to decide which federal workers are exempt.  Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said \u2018Shutdowns are terrible and they should be avoided.\u2019  Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said \u2018Right now, we don\u2019t even have a negotiation.\u2019  Alabama Sen. Katie Britt described Schumer\u2019s change as political theater.  The article notes that a shutdown would furlough non\u2011exempt federal workers, who would receive back pay once the shutdown ends, and that the last two shutdowns left the status quo unchanged.  Key metrics mentioned include a seven\u2011week temporary funding patch, an Oct.\u202f1 shutdown deadline, a six\u2011month stopgap bill, and the need for 60 Senate votes to pass a funding measure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:43 AM\nSource:[tennesseelookout.com](https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/09/18/repub/us-rolls-toward-a-terrible-government-shutdown-no-exit-ramp-in-sight/)\n\n**Democratic leaders in Congress demand a meeting with Trump as government shutdown looms - The Boston Globe**\nThe article reports that two New York Democrats wrote a letter demanding a meeting with President Trump over the looming federal government shutdown. They wrote, 'We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,' and added, 'Democrats have been clear and consistent in our position,' and that they are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis. A Trump administration official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, dismissed the Democrats' demand. Congress, controlled by Republicans, failed to resolve the funding issue before lawmakers left town Friday for a break. The House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded into November, but the measure failed in the Senate, and a Democratic proposal that would have boosted health\u2011care funds also failed. The article notes that the current budget year and funding expire in less than two weeks, threatening a shutdown. Trump predicted Friday that there could be 'a closed country for a period of time' and said the government will continue to 'take care' of the military and Social Security payments in a closure. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R\u2011La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R\u2011S.D., have put forward a short\u2011term funding measure, a typical way Congress resolves such logjams, which would keep government operations running at current levels while talks continue. The House narrowly passed the temporary measure on a mostly party\u2011line vote, but the Senate requires a 60\u2011vote threshold, meaning support from both parties is needed. Democrats are working to protect health\u2011care programs; their proposal would extend enhanced health\u2011insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year and reverse Medicaid cuts included in Republicans' tax\u2011break and spending\u2011cut bill enacted earlier this year. Republicans say the Democrats' demands to reverse Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, though they acknowledge there is time to address the health\u2011insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead. The article also notes that Trump\u2019s first term saw a month\u2011long shutdown, the longest in federal history, in 2018\u20112019.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 09:31 PM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/20/nation/government-shutdown-trump-democrats/)\n\n**Schumer, Jeffries request meeting with Trump ahead of potential government shutdown**\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sent a letter to President Trump requesting a meeting to avoid a government shutdown after the September\u202f30 funding deadline.  In the letter they warned that \"With the September\u202f30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats,\" and urged the president to meet \"directly to reach an agreement to keep the government open and address the Republican healthcare crisis.\"  The Senate rejected a clean stopgap measure that would have funded the government through November\u202f21; only Senator John\u202fFetterman voted in favor, highlighting the 60\u2011vote threshold needed.  A competing Democratic measure, which would have extended Obamacare subsidies and reversed Medicaid cuts, also failed to advance.  The White House said the letter shows desperation, stating \"Dems walked away from a bipartisan negotiation on the [continuing resolution].\"  Trump criticized Democrats, saying \"The Republicans want to keep government open. But in the Senate, we have 53 Republicans total, and we need 60 votes,\" and added that Democrats \"actually dislike our country greatly.\"  Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John\u202fThune, urged Republicans not to negotiate with Democrats and warned that the Senate would return on September\u202f29 and the House on October.

In 1980 Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued two legal opinions that established the rule that if appropriations lapse, the federal government must cease non\u2011essential operations, while the president may continue essential functions (article). The article notes that for more than a century, from the post\u2011Civil War era through the 1970s, funding gaps were handled without drama because employees continued to work and were paid late (article). The current budget impasse began when the House passed a GOP\u2011backed short\u2011term continuing resolution (CR) to fund agencies through 21 November, adding $88\u202fmillion in new security funding in response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie\u202fKirk (article). The Senate rejected that CR 44\u201148, falling short of the 60\u2011vote threshold (article). A competing Democratic proposal, which included expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies and restored Medicaid funding, also failed 47\u201145 (article). As a result, no spending agreement is in place and appropriations will lapse at the end of the day on 30 September 2025, potentially triggering a partial shutdown on 1 October 2025 (article). The article quotes Senate Minority Leader Chuck\u202fSchumer (D\u2011NY) saying, 'Republicans cannot expect that another take\u2011it\u2011or\u2011leave\u2011it extension of government funding that fails to address healthcare costs is going to cut it for the American people. By trying to make this partisan, Donald Trump and Republicans are shutting the government down.' (article). It also quotes Senate Majority Leader John\u202fThune (R\u2011SD) saying, 'Eventually it's going to be an up\u2011or\u2011down vote on whether or not we want to keep the government open. Democrats seem more intent in satisfying their very leftist base, who is desperately wanting to see a government shutdown.' (article). Both sides demand that a continuing resolution address healthcare concerns\u2014permanent Obamacare subsidies and reversal of Medicaid cuts for Democrats, and a 'clean' CR without policy riders for Republicans\u2014raising the odds of a shutdown (article). The article contrasts this modern political leverage with the pre\u20111980 era, describing the shutdown as a tool for drawing media attention and rallying constituencies, and noting that federal employees face furloughs, delayed pay, and disrupted services, even though essential staff such as air\u2011traffic controllers and law\u2011enforcement officers must continue working without pay until appropriations are signed (article). The article concludes that a shutdown does not streamline government but paralyzes it, creating hardship for workers and making politics more divisive (article).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 10:07 PM\nSource:[FedSmith.com](https://www.fedsmith.com/2025/09/19/government-shutdown-approaches/)\n\n**US rolls toward a 'terrible' government shutdown, no exit ramp in sight**\nThe article reports a deadlock on Capitol Hill over a federal funding bill that could trigger a government shutdown.  Democrats and Republicans are at odds over whether to fund the government for seven weeks or allow a shutdown that could last longer.  The piece cites the 2013 16\u2011day shutdown over the Affordable Care Act and the 2018\u20112019 35\u2011day shutdown over a border wall to illustrate that past shutdowns yielded no policy gains.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is quoted as warning that a shutdown would be a \"gift\" for President Trump and a distraction from his agenda, and he has since shifted his stance, refusing to support a seven\u2011week stopgap that would keep the government open until the Oct.\u202f1 deadline.  The article also includes remarks from Republican senators: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito calls the shutdown a \"misery march\"; Sen. John Kennedy warns that Trump would have \"unfettered discretion\" over which federal workers could continue to work; Sen. Brian Schatz says Trump\u2019s refusal to negotiate is the root of the impasse; Sen. Chris Murphy says no progress can be made without bipartisan talks; Sen. Katie Britt frames Schumer\u2019s change as political theater; and House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro stresses there is still time for a continuing resolution.  House Speaker Mike Johnson notes that the Affordable Care Act tax\u2011credit extension is a separate issue, while the House Republican stopgap bill contains no provisions for it.  The article notes a week\u2011long recess for Rosh Hashanah, with both chambers scheduled to reconvene on Sept.\u202f29, leaving little time to negotiate before the Oct.\u202f1 shutdown deadline.  The piece concludes that a prolonged shutdown would financially strain federal employees and the public, as none of the 12 annual funding bills have passed on time.  All federal workers would be furloughed, with back\u2011pay paid after the shutdown ends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/09/us-rolls-toward-terrible-government-shutdown-no-exit-ramp-sight/408195/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014Congressional Affairs, Legislative Risk Analysis, Political Science, Public Administration, and American Studies\u2014there is overwhelming consensus that a U.S. federal government shutdown before October 2, 2025, is almost certain, with every expert placing the probability at 97%. Each analysis draws on deep knowledge of congressional procedure, historical base rates for shutdowns, current partisan dynamics, and the narrow legislative window left before the appropriations deadline. The main factors driving up the probability include the Senate's filibuster requirement (necessitating at least seven Democratic votes), intense partisan polarization with both sides entrenched and seeking to use the shutdown as leverage, breakdown in negotiations, explicit executive branch threats to let the shutdown happen (and even use permanent layoffs as pressure), and the lack of ongoing or effective last-minute negotiations. Although the experts acknowledge a slim historical possibility that a last-minute continuing resolution could avert the shutdown, they argue that the current situation features more procedural, political, and rhetorical obstacles than usual. The most likely scenario is a brief but technically qualifying lapse in appropriations, triggered by an official shutdown announcement from the Office of Personnel Management. In summary, all relevant institutional, strategic, and historical indicators point decisively toward a shutdown occurring before the resolution date.",
