Streeting, while often mentioned as a potential, is polling low among party activists and is not obviously favored by most key factions (left, unions, centrist machine). Even if a contest occurs, Streeting is a third or fourth rung candidate. Given all these factors, my base rate for a candidate like Streeting emerging is very low \u2014 recent Labour contests (Corbyn 2015, Starmer 2020) show membership swings can surprise, but only if a candidate's brand resonates deeply with the mood, which is not currently the case for Streeting. A win is possible only in a 'split field/unity candidate' scenario, but the preconditions for this are not present.

Recent deputy leadership contests and party polling show a party base eager for clear direction, but not presently rallying to Streeting.\n\nWhile membership volatility and crisis could favor a 'compromise' candidate, historical base rates suggest Labour leaders tend to be those with highest member/polling favorability or powerful factional/unifying support, neither of which describe Streeting at present.

While Starmer faces growing challenges and a contest within 12-24 months is more probable, structural and selectorate factors make it unlikely Streeting will win.

Current polling and media signal deep dissatisfaction, but Starmer still sits atop substantial parliamentary control.

The historical tendency for Labour (and major UK parties generally) to coalesce around compromise candidates when elite factions balance but deadlock is worth emphasizing; rare 'surprise' winners have often emerged not strictly from member activism but via elite-aligned consensus or exhaustion. The assessment is prudent in weighing both procedural barriers and the very low (but not zero) odds that a combination of circumstances produces a Streeting win, effectively encapsulating base-rate skepticism while allowing for party system unpredictability.

For example, as seen in the 2015 contest (Corbyn's shock victory) and 2010 (Miliband edging his brother via affiliate/union support), the membership can move quickly and unpredictably in response to perceived party crises\u2014even if early polling and base rates did not show the ultimate winner leading initially. Additionally, the high bar for nomination is important, but shifts in elite consensus sometimes accelerate rapidly in volatile periods, which might allow an outsider like Streeting to surpass current expectations. Thus, while the probability should remain low, this forecast may slightly overstate the stability of current member preferences and underweight the possibility of dynamic, crisis-induced coalition shifts that instant-runoff voting can reward."

The analysis rightly identifies that major leadership winners usually embody or unite core sub-identities, whereas Streeting is perceived as a centrist technocrat at a time when membership polling signals appetite for an alternative direction.

However, while the 8% estimate is justified as a tail-risk scenario, it may overstate Streeting's viability, especially relative to the strong historical base rate against candidates with similar standing. His supporters have not demonstrated the ability to rapidly consolidate endorsements or appeal across factions; meanwhile, Labour's current mood (per recent news and polling) is focused on correction through more left or 'unity' options. With the contest likely to feature at least one more popular, better-organized candidate, and instant-runoff voting rewarding broad-based appeal, a probability materially above 5% seems difficult to sustain barring huge, sudden turbulence. The case for 8% is defensible on 'coalition of chaos' grounds, but the extant polling and party machinery suggest Streeting's chance is technically nonzero, but smaller still than asserted here."

By emphasizing that a 'very specific set of circumstances' (elite fragmentation, stalemate, or collapse) must arise for Streeting to win, the forecast robustly factors the kind of black-swan events that elite theory requires without inflating their likelihood.

In Labour contests, member identity and affective polarization\u2014who members feel represents their lived experiences or factional allegiances\u2014can override raw polling data, especially amid generational or ideological divides. Streeting is associated with a technocratic, centrist image that, even in a crisis, is unlikely to inspire a sufficiently broad second-preference coalition unless there is complete exhaustion with both the left and Starmerite camps. While polling is a useful barometer, identity salience and factional branding (or lack thereof) often play outsized roles in real-world runoffs, especially when members use their votes to either affirm or reject dominant party identities.

The historical tendency for Labour (and major UK parties generally) to coalesce around compromise candidates when elite factions balance but deadlock is worth emphasizing; rare 'surprise' winners have often emerged not strictly from member activism but via elite-aligned consensus or exhaustion. The assessment is prudent in weighing both procedural barriers and the very low (but not zero) odds that a combination of circumstances produces a Streeting win, effectively encapsulating base-rate skepticism while allowing for party system unpredictability.

Furthermore, the analysis brings in institutional memory of surprising membership swings (as with Corbyn, 2015), but correctly judges that such events require underlying member momentum that Streeting currently lacks. The estimate is defensibly at the low end, cautious of the rare but real possibility of a split field or party crisis paving the way for compromise, yet gives proper weight to the extremely high thresholds such a scenario would require.

The lowest estimates (3%) are justified with reference to hard polling, nomination mechanics, and historical base rates.

The motion, passed during the party\u2019s annual conference in Aberdeen, rejected a rebel amendment proposing a 'de facto' referendum model\u2014where a pro-independence majority in the popular vote would automatically trigger independence negotiations\u2014despite its prior advocacy by former leader Nicola Sturgeon, who later called it a 'mistake.' Swinney emphasized the party is 'within touching distance' of the 65-seat threshold, urging a clear message to voters. Depute leader Keith Brown reinforced the need for a 'clear question and clear answer.' The shift reflects renewed confidence after the SNP\u2019s 2024 general election collapse, where it lost 38 of 48 Westminster seats amid criticism of a muddled strategy. Now leading in polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, the party is targeting 'soft yes' supporters who have drifted away. However, the proportional representation system makes a majority difficult\u2014SNP has only achieved it once, in 2011 under Alex Salmond.

Neither candidate is from the far left or the New Labour faction, and both are relatively well-known within the party, though less so than outgoing deputy Angela Rayner, who resigned after breaching the ministerial code by failing to pay enough tax on her \u00a3800,000 flat. The deputy leader role lacks a formal job description but includes participation in the National Executive Committee, the political cabinet (a senior party meeting without civil servants), and the weekly parliamentary meeting. The role is not automatically the deputy prime minister\u2014David Lammy holds that position. One source describes the deputy as the 'campaigner in chief,' highlighting its strategic importance ahead of May's elections. Powell, recently sacked from the cabinet without a clear explanation, argues for open debate and a 'course correction' in government, criticizing the perceived clique around Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Her backers claim the party needs a 'yin to the yang' of No 10 to balance power. Phillipson\u2019s team warns that an outspoken deputy could destabilize the government, arguing instead for a quiet, inside advocate who pushes members' interests\u2014especially on poverty\u2014without becoming a lightning rod for dissent. Phillipson promises to increase member involvement by soliciting views every three months via app or website, holding direct online meetings with ministers, and restricting National Policy Forum (NPF) submissions to official party-linked organizations. Powell has stronger backing from constituency parties and affiliated groups like the Society of Labour Lawyers, while Phillipson has more MPs and union support. Despite Powell being the favorite according to most Labour sources and limited polling, the outcome remains uncertain. The contest reflects broader member frustration with Starmer\u2019s leadership and decisions. A Powell win could be seen as a rebuke to Starmer, potentially reinforcing the narrative of his 'non-Midas touch.' The decision will ultimately reflect whether Labour members want a visible, external voice or a discreet, internal advocate. The race has already seen mutual criticism, with Phillipson\u2019s allies accusing Powell of avoiding TV hustings and Powell dismissing claims of divisiveness as 'ridiculous.' Both have campaigned widely across 20+ events. The role of deputy leader has historically varied\u2014from loyal enabler to pressure valve to internal opposition\u2014shaping the dynamics of leadership.

Polling shows a sharp decline in public support, with over 2.8 million people signing a petition opposing the plan. Labour MPs are expressing anger, citing an influx of angry constituent emails and protests outside the conference. Critics argue the government failed to effectively communicate the policy\u2019s purpose\u2014initially framed as a tool to address irregular migration\u2014but now repositioned as a means to simplify access to public services. Concerns have intensified over the potential inclusion of 13-year-olds in the rollout, with critics calling it 'sinister' and 'Orwellian'. Downing Street acknowledges the need for a renewed communications strategy, with Starmer calling for a 'national debate' on the issue. Former Labour strategist John McTernan urged a shift from the outdated 'grid' model of policy announcements to continuous campaigning, emphasizing the need to repeatedly tell the story of how digital ID benefits citizens. Despite the backlash, the government plans to introduce fresh planning reforms next week to stimulate economic growth ahead of a challenging Budget, with hopes the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will boost growth forecasts. However, business leaders remain wary of further taxation, and the government faces scrutiny over the collapsed China spying case, with MPs demanding answers and accusing Starmer of being too accommodating toward China. Additionally, Labour MPs are expected to push for updates on SEND reforms, with fears of a potential rebellion similar to the failed welfare reform revolt earlier in the year. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith criticized the government\u2019s messaging, calling digital ID part of a series of ineffective anti-Reform policies, including 'one-in, one-out' and 'smash the gangs'. Labour MP Steve Yemm described the government\u2019s challenges as comparable to rebuilding Britain after war, underscoring the scale of the task ahead.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/labour-anger-starmer-pushes-digital-id-3972503)\n\n**SNP rebel plan for 'de facto' independence vote won't work, says Swinney**\nJohn Swinney, First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP, has rejected a proposal by SNP rebels to use the 2026 Scottish Parliament election as a 'de facto' independence referendum, arguing that such a strategy would not secure international or UK government recognition. The rebels' plan, backed by nine SNP branches, calls for independence-supporting parties\u2014including Alba and the Greens\u2014to initiate divorce negotiations with the UK if they collectively win a majority of the popular vote, bypassing a formal referendum. Swinney insists that only a clear, constitutionally valid referendum can deliver a legitimate mandate for independence, citing the 2014 precedent and the need for domestic and international legitimacy. He dismissed Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s 2022 proposal to use a general election as a de facto referendum, stating it would not work. Swinney also predicted that if the SNP wins a majority in 2026, Keir Starmer would be forced to resign, and his successor would be more likely to allow a new referendum. Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar criticized the SNP for internal divisions over independence while public services, particularly the NHS, face crisis levels, warning that the NHS 'may not survive another five years of SNP incompetence.' Swinney acknowledged the lack of a 'shortcut' to reducing record NHS waiting lists, referencing a Royal College of Emergency Medicine report linking over 800 deaths in Scotland to A&E delays. He also addressed tensions with hospital doctors, as the British Medical Association (BMA) plans a pay strike ballot, despite the Scottish Health Secretary offering 4.25% for 2025\u201326 and 3.75% for 2026\u201327, which nurses accepted. The debate over the independence strategy will be decided during the SNP conference in Aberdeen.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 08:52 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/snp-rebel-plan-facto-independence-205218973.html)\n\n**Keir Starmer\u2019s Woes and Media Magnification**\nSir Keir Starmer, the UK's Prime Minister since Labour's decisive victory in July 2024, faces mounting criticism and declining public appeal, according to a critical article from Dissident Voice published on October 9, 2025. Despite initial momentum, Starmer is portrayed as experiencing a 'precipitous decline,' with unnamed 'insiders' and party figures criticizing his leadership, judgment, communication skills, and perceived lack of executive presence. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reported speaking to 30 unnamed government and party officials, all expressing concerns about Starmer\u2019s leadership style and policy decisions. Media magnification is cited as a key factor in eroding his popularity, with outlets amplifying internal dissent and speculation about a leadership challenge. Potential challengers include Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, and Shabana Mahmood, the new Home Secretary, though none have formally declared. The article also highlights the rising threat of Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which gained 677 councillors in May 2025 and was projected by YouGov on September 26, 2025, to win 311 seats in a hypothetical election\u2014surpassing Labour\u2019s 21% polling in The Guardian\u2019s October 2025 tracker. The article notes the UK\u2019s First Past the Post system may suppress such challengers, but Reform UK\u2019s surge reflects broader European trends of nationalist discontent over crime and immigration. At Labour\u2019s Liverpool conference, Starmer delivered a 'full-throated defence of progressive values,' with some observers noting an emotional connection in his speech. Defenders include Fraser Nelson of The Spectator, who counters Farage\u2019s claims with data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales showing a four-fifths drop in crime since 1995. However, Starmer is criticized for failing to effectively counter the fear-driven narrative propagated by Reform UK, while the Conservatives are seen as waiting for Labour\u2019s downfall.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[Dissident Voice](https://dissidentvoice.org/2025/10/keir-starmers-woes-and-media-magnification/)\n\n**SNP backs Swinney's 'clear' strategy for new independence referendum**\nSNP members overwhelmingly endorsed leader John Swinney's 'clear and unambiguous' strategy for a second independence referendum, affirming that winning a majority of seats\u201465 or more\u2014in the next Holyrood election (May 2026) is the only uncontested path to securing a new vote on Scotland's future.

The Labour government is citing official data from The Times suggesting the UK economy would be approximately \u00a3120 billion larger by 2035 if not for Brexit. This comes amid sluggish economic growth, with UK GDP increasing by only 0.3% in Quarter 2 (April to June) 2025, following a 0.7% rise in Quarter 1 (January to March) 2025, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Starmer directly attacked Farage at the Labour Party conference, claiming he 'doesn't like Britain' and 'doesn't believe in Britain,' and questioned whether Farage has ever said anything positive about the country's future. He accused Farage and others on both the right and left of prioritizing decline for political gain, calling them 'snake oil merchants' who rely on grievance and victimhood narratives. In response, Farage posted a video on X (formerly Twitter), asserting that Starmer is 'not fit to be Prime Minister' and accusing Labour of labelling critics of immigration policies as racist. Farage claimed Reform UK is ahead in the polls and that Labour is in 'blind panic,' arguing that their policies are inconsistent and that he and his party represent sensible, grown-up governance. The exchange reflects a heightened political rivalry ahead of the next general election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 08:37 AM\nSource:[Birmingham Mail](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/sir-keir-starmer-expected-blame-32657146)\n\n**'Voters will go to Reform': Labour anger as Starmer pushes on with digital ID**\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faces growing internal and public backlash over his government's digital ID policy, which was announced before Labour's conference but received minimal attention during the event.

This stance contrasts with a proposal backed by nine SNP branches advocating for a 'de facto referendum' approach\u2014where a combined separatist vote victory on the list seats would be interpreted as a mandate for independence and the formation of a 'provisional government'. The internal divide is intensified by declining public trust in the Scottish Government, which has hit an all-time low since devolution, and falling poll numbers for the SNP. Swinney dismissed the alternative proposal as ineffective, asserting that only a repeat of the 2011 SNP majority can compel the UK government to grant a referendum. He told LBC that a majority would allow him to negotiate with a different UK Prime Minister, implying Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership would be undermined. The conference also coincides with the first anniversary of Alex Salmond\u2019s death, with former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon set to speak at a fringe event about her 'The Promise' initiative, which has been criticized as 'shambolic' by watchdogs. Meanwhile, SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn accused Keir Starmer of worsening conditions in the UK, calling for a 'fresh start' through independence. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar condemned the SNP for focusing on independence while public services are under strain, declaring the party 'desperately out of touch' and warning against a 'third decade' of what he described as 'tired and incompetent government'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 07:50 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15181971/Swinney-set-independence-showdown-SNP-activists-party-conference.html)\n\n**John Swinney's revival of the SNP has given his party a shot at a fifth term in office - Daily Record**\nJohn Swinney has led a remarkable revival of the Scottish National Party (SNP), transforming it from a state of political collapse following the 2024 general election\u2014where it dropped from 48 to 9 MPs\u2014toward a potential fifth term in office at the Scottish Parliament. Taking over from Humza Yousaf, Swinney faced immediate challenges, including a disorganized party headquarters described as 'bust' and 'fundamentally broken,' with difficulties in producing a manifesto. Internal SNP analyses initially predicted only 36 MSPs in the next election, but that number rose to 60 by October 2025, reflecting a significant turnaround. Swinney\u2019s strategy focuses on ending the SNP\u2019s association with unpopular policies under Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon, rebuilding voter trust, and capitalizing on the political vacuum created by Keir Starmer\u2019s UK government. With the SNP polling at 37%\u2014well ahead of Scottish Labour\u2014strategists believe an additional 5% on regional lists and a few percentage points in constituencies could secure an outright majority. However, the lead is fragile, driven more by voter dissatisfaction with Labour than confidence in the SNP\u2019s governance, which remains poor. Scottish Labour, backed by the full UK party machine and a well-resourced campaign, is poised to mount a strong challenge, particularly from January onward. Despite financial constraints, Swinney has delivered a resurgence in SNP fortunes, placing the party on the verge of a historic victory, though the outcome remains uncertain with seven months to go.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 11:11 AM\nSource:[Daily Record](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/john-swinneys-revival-snp-given-36046243)\n\n**Is This Man Britain's Next Prime Minister?**\nThe article examines growing dissatisfaction within the UK Labour Party following Prime Minister Keir Starmer's first year in office, highlighting declining enthusiasm at the 2025 Labour Party conference in Liverpool, where attendance and engagement were lower than in previous years. Despite Starmer's keynote speech aiming to define a progressive agenda against Reform UK, it failed to inspire party members. Key policy decisions\u2014such as maintaining the two-child welfare cap, approving record arms sales to Israel, weakening workers' rights, and proposing immigration crackdowns\u2014have fueled disillusionment. A notable moment was the conference floor\u2019s rejection of a leadership-backed motion downplaying the UN Commission of Inquiry\u2019s findings on Gaza, while a motion calling for an arms embargo on Israel passed. Additionally, controversy arose when Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and minister Jonathan Reynolds attended a TikTok-sponsored event while protesting workers were present. Amid this demoralization, Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, has emerged as the leading contender to succeed Starmer. Burnham, a former shadow cabinet minister and long-time Labour figure, has gained popularity through his progressive policies\u2014such as launching the publicly controlled Bee Network, tackling homelessness, and supporting union movements. His 2020 public rebuke of Boris Johnson\u2019s pandemic response solidified his national profile. In his co-authored book Head North, Burnham argues that UK inequality is systemic and deliberate, advocating for a written constitution, electoral reform, and a legal guarantee of access to essentials like housing and transport. Polls indicate that over 62% of Labour members would support Burnham over Starmer in a leadership contest, with 29% backing Starmer.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/?post_type=article&p=573193)\n\n**Keir Starmer\u2019s Woes and Media Magnification**\nSir Keir Starmer, the UK's Prime Minister since Labour's decisive victory in July 2024, faces mounting criticism and declining public appeal, according to a critical article from Dissident Voice published on October 9, 2025. Despite initial momentum, Starmer is portrayed as experiencing a 'precipitous decline,' with unnamed 'insiders' and party figures criticizing his leadership, judgment, communication skills, and perceived lack of executive presence. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reported speaking to 30 unnamed government and party officials, all expressing concerns about Starmer\u2019s leadership style and policy decisions. Media magnification is cited as a key factor in eroding his popularity, with outlets amplifying internal dissent and speculation about a leadership challenge. Potential challengers include Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, and Shabana Mahmood, the new Home Secretary, though none have formally declared. The article also highlights the rising threat of Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which gained 677 councillors in May 2025 and was projected by YouGov on September 26, 2025, to win 311 seats in a hypothetical election\u2014surpassing Labour\u2019s 21% polling in The Guardian\u2019s October 2025 tracker. The article notes the UK\u2019s First Past the Post system may suppress such challengers, but Reform UK\u2019s surge reflects broader European trends of nationalist discontent over crime and immigration. At Labour\u2019s Liverpool conference, Starmer delivered a 'full-throated defence of progressive values,' with some observers noting an emotional connection in his speech. Defenders include Fraser Nelson of The Spectator, who counters Farage\u2019s claims with data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales showing a four-fifths drop in crime since 1995. However, Starmer is criticized for failing to effectively counter the fear-driven narrative propagated by Reform UK, while the Conservatives are seen as waiting for Labour\u2019s downfall.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[Dissident Voice](https://dissidentvoice.org/2025/10/keir-starmers-woes-and-media-magnification/)\n\n**'Britain\u2019s proud legacy is at risk but Labour\u2019s leadership can save it' - LabourList**\nAlf Dubs, a Holocaust refugee who arrived in the UK via the Kindertransport in 1938, warns that Britain\u2019s historic legacy of offering sanctuary to refugees is at risk due to Conservative plans to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), a move he calls ill-informed and dangerous. He highlights the UK\u2019s long-standing tradition of welcoming refugees from the Basque region, Holocaust survivors, and those fleeing conflicts in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Uganda, Vietnam, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Ukraine. Dubs emphasizes that this legacy\u2014rooted in post-war human rights principles\u2014is foundational to British democracy and society. He criticizes the Conservative and Reform parties for exploiting global instability to undermine international cooperation, calling such rhetoric reductive and harmful. While he commends the Prime Minister and Home Secretary for publicly rejecting withdrawal from the ECHR, he notes the government\u2019s challenge in balancing border control with the right to seek asylum. Dubs points to public generosity, citing record volunteer placements through the charity Refugees at Home in July 2025, as evidence that the British public remains supportive of refugees. He urges Labour to maintain a unified, principled stance on asylum, warning against mixed messaging\u2014such as the Prime Minister\u2019s comment that refugees have a 'golden ticket'\u2014which risks fueling fear and division. Dubs praises Keir Starmer\u2019s conference speech as a model of clear, compassionate leadership and calls for Labour to consistently uphold these values, promote international cooperation, and shift the asylum narrative from divisive far-right rhetoric to progressive, solutions-driven policy. He concludes that with consistent messaging and principled leadership, Labour can preserve the UK\u2019s proud history of sanctuary for future generations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[labourlist.org](https://labourlist.org/2025/10/britian-legacy-on-refugees-is-at-risk/)\n\n**Andy Burnham says MPs want him to oust Starmer - four ways he could actually do it**\nAndy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, said Labour MPs are privately urging him to challenge Keir Starmer for the party leadership. He denied plotting to return to Westminster but confirmed his ambition to become prime minister, saying 'I stood twice to be leader of the Labour Party. And I think that tells you, doesn't it?'. The article explains Labour\u2019s leadership rules: a contest is triggered only if the leader resigns or the post is declared vacant; MPs can pass no\u2011confidence motions but they have no constitutional effect. A candidate must secure nominations from at least 10\u202f% of the 399 MPs (i.e., 40 MPs) and then either the backing of 5\u202f% of constituency Labour parties (\u224832 CLPs) or support from at least three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions. The winner is decided by a one\u2011member\u2011one\u2011vote system. Burnham\u2019s main barrier is that he is not an MP; until he wins a seat he cannot stand. The article outlines several routes: winning a by\u2011election after a Labour MP resigns, acting as a kingmaker by endorsing a challenger, or waiting until the next general election to stand as an MP. Each route has procedural hurdles and requires alignment of circumstances. The piece concludes that the cleanest path for Burnham is to become an MP at the next general election, after which he could meet the nomination thresholds and contest the leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/andy-burnham-mps-oust-pm-four-ways-he-could-do-it-3937933)\n\n**Could Keir Starmer really be facing a leadership contest?**\nThe article examines the feasibility of a leadership contest to oust Labour leader Keir Starmer. It explains that, under Labour rules, a challenger must secure nominations from 20\u202f% of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), which equates to about 80 MPs, before the Labour conference on 28\u202fSeptember. The piece notes that Starmer\u2019s 2024 electoral victory gave him a personal mandate, making a challenge unlikely. It outlines procedural details, including that a candidate must be an MP or become one via a by\u2011election, and cites the example of Graham Stringer as a potential stand\u2011down. The article compares past PM changes\u2014John Major in 1990 and Boris Johnson in 2019\u2014to suggest that a leadership change would be divisive and unlikely to bring substantial policy shifts. It concludes that a leadership contest would be politically hazardous and would probably prolong internal party conflict.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 09:42 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/politics-explained/labour-leadership-challenge-keir-starmer-andy-burnham-b2827742.html)\n\n**Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell to seek union backing in Labour...**\nThe Labour Party\u2019s deputy\u2011leadership contest has moved to the nomination stage, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell securing 175 and 117 MP nominations respectively, comfortably surpassing the 80\u2011nomination threshold that eliminated backbencher Bell Ribeiro\u2011Addy, who received only 24.

    "summary": "All expert forecasts strongly agree that Wes Streeting is highly unlikely to win the next UK Labour Party leadership election. The consensus probability typically falls between 3% and 8%, with most clustering around the lower end of this range. Common reasons for this low probability include:\n\n- Wes Streeting's modest popularity within Labour's membership (net favorability of +9 versus much higher ratings for rivals like Ed Miliband and Andy Burnham) and lack of a strong, loyal factional base.\n- The Labour leadership contest will only be triggered if Keir Starmer resigns or is forced out, which is not considered imminent. Base rates for rapid leader replacement\u2014especially after a general election win\u2014are low.\n- Should a leadership contest occur, key frontrunners such as Andy Burnham (assuming he becomes an MP), Ed Miliband, and Shabana Mahmood are widely seen as more likely victors due to greater member appeal, union support, and cross-factional viability.\n- Streeting is identified with the party\u2019s centrist/Blairite wing, which is not currently dominant among either members or unions. He lacks the cross-factional or deep grassroots support usually necessary to win a Labour leadership race.\n- Most analysts see a narrow path for Streeting only if all major rivals are unavailable or damaged, the party is highly factionalized, and Streeting is positioned as the compromise candidate\u2014circumstances considered very unlikely.\n\nScenarios for a 'No' outcome overwhelmingly involve another better-positioned candidate winning upon a vacancy, or no contest taking place at all. A 'Yes' scenario is universally described as requiring extraordinary events: splits among leading factions, lack of availability of stronger candidates, and Streeting somehow emerging as a compromise candidate able to consolidate sufficient support in the party\u2019s instant-runoff system.\n\nOverall, every expert points to a lack of strong polling for Streeting, few clear endorsement networks, procedural hurdles, and a context in which much bigger political figures would, in most plausible scenarios, overwhelm his candidacy. The final probabilities assigned to Streeting reflect a remote but nonzero chance, contingent on rare party crisis dynamics and the failure of all major rivals to unite their natural bases.",
