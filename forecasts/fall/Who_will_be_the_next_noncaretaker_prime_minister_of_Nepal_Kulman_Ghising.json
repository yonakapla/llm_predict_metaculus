Given the urgency and in light of Ghising\u2019s status as a Gen-Z favorite and nonpartisan technocrat, the President, military, and protest movement rapidly converge on him as an acceptable consensus candidate.

The base rate for this class of technocrat outsider appointments within 4 months of a caretaker PM\u2019s installation is extremely low in Nepal and comparable cases in South Asia. While Ghising remains respected, popular in protest circles, and a plausible 'dark horse' under crisis, all procedural, legal, and elite signals since September 12, 2025 point to Karki as the consensus caretaking option. Technically, the scenario is possible (not zero), but these odds are sharply depressed by the inertia and self-reinforcing legitimacy of the present arrangement. No reporting currently indicates Karki is at imminent risk, or that elite or popular forces are preparing a new prime ministerial rotation before January 2026. Therefore, the well-supported base rate must dominate, with a small (but non-negligible) upward adjustment to acknowledge Nepal\u2019s ongoing instability and Ghising\u2019s elevated profile.",

However, the constitutional, political, and elite-negotiation logics of caretaker governments, as well as Nepali precedent, make the ascension of a caretaker minister to the top job extremely rare. The strongest scenario for a Ghising premiership is a fresh post-election deadlock in which elites, pressured by Gen Z or the army, turn to a popular non-politician. His prior mention as interim PM candidate underscores his appeal, but Sushila Karki\u2019s selection\u2014bolstered by both Gen Z and the military\u2014suggests that ticket has been punched; Ghising\u2019s trajectory is more likely to remain technocratic or support/ministerial unless new instability erupts. Absent a radical break, party or Gen Z-aligned politicians will have a clearer path, though his profile merits a base rate above bare minimum. My reasoned probability is thus slightly higher than the original base rate, at 24%, reflecting a confluence of volatility, technocratic appeal, and elite bargaining uncertainty, but recognizing substantial structural headwinds.",

The most likely path to power for Ghising would be as the face of a broad-based, reformist coalition emerging from electoral upheaval; yet, the Gen-Z protest movement is diffuse and currently lacks (a) party machinery, (b) a unified leadership ethos, and (c) a proven track record of post-election discipline. Historical precedent for a technocratic, non-party PM after elections is exceedingly low. Nonetheless, given the extraordinary public discontent, the disruption of party elites, and Ghising\u2019s favorable mention in the Gen-Z list of alternative leaders, there is a tangible, if small, chance that he could become the compromise PM if traditional consensus-makers fail again post-election. My estimate weighs the powerful but unlikely scenario of a post-election deadlock radical enough to allow a technocratic outsider like Ghising to ascend, against the heavy institutional inertia and party-political logic that have dominated Nepali politics for decades.",

While Gen-Z and protest dynamics might continue to disrupt the old order, Nepal\u2019s coalition arithmetic and legislature-centric system heavily favor traditional party actors or their chosen unity candidates. For Ghising to become the next non-caretaker PM would require a dramatic and coordinated political realignment\u2014either a successful new party vehicle led by him winning the election (for which there\u2019s no tangible evidence at present), or all major parties/Gen-Z blocs rallying behind him post-election as a compromise, which is plausible but highly improbable given party interests.

All current evidence shows that Ghising is an interim, crisis-solution pick\u2014brought in by youth movement pressure\u2014with real but limited political capital, and not the head of any major party. The trajectory in South Asia and especially in Nepal is for interim governments to give way to coalition politics dominated by party insiders. While Ghising is well regarded, and his appointment as energy/infrastructure minister cements his role as a key public servant, nothing in the current newsflow or historical pattern robustly suggests his candidacy will be advanced by any likely parliamentary majority\u2014or that the Gen-Z movement will convert its strength to electoral dominance so rapidly. Unless a coalition deadlock emerges post-election and public pressure becomes irresistible, Ghising remains an outsider. The constitutional, elite, and party-system barriers are considerable. As such, I assess the odds as somewhat above a pure base rate to reflect new social dynamics (Gen-Z, the public enthusiasm for 'outsiders'), but still well below 50%. Therefore, maintaining an initial probability of 24% is justified.",

However, the reasoning appears to overweight the likelihood of a purely post-election deadlock being the necessary condition for Ghising's ascension, perhaps underemphasizing the possibility of an acute, pre-election collapse in the caretaker arrangement. While such a collapse remains unlikely, Nepalese crisis politics in recent years (especially since 2015) have sometimes produced abrupt government changes not strictly post-electoral. Furthermore, your focus on Ghising's lack of party machinery does not fully acknowledge the role that civil society and non-party mass protest can play in forcefully re-opening the leadership question, even during an interim period, especially if triggered by a new scandal or severe legitimacy crisis. While the overall probability should remain low, a more explicit incorporation of these alternative, if remote, caretaker-period crisis scenarios would position your analysis closer to a full-spectrum understanding of the current volatility."

Therefore, the prospect of a technocratic 'dark horse' like Ghising is perhaps slightly higher in this context than your almost exclusive focus on elite negotiation precedent suggests. While you correctly apply the structural headwinds against Ghising, your scenario modeling underplays the potential interplay of elite fatigue, protest fatigue, and the risk of caretaker collapse.

Should the current caretaker arrangement falter\u2014whether due to renewed Gen-Z mobilization or high-profile scandal\u2014there is a plausible pathway for a broad-based national consensus around a 'clean' figure, even absent party infrastructure.

The current volatility and the parallel loss of party legitimacy raise the probability ceiling slightly\u2014even prior to parliamentary deadlock\u2014by making out-of-cycle, caretaker-to-permanent PM scenarios more thinkable than in less turbulent times. You could strengthen your analysis by more robustly considering how hybrid pressure (elite + popular + security) might force a rapid consensus around a technocrat in crisis, not solely as a matter of last-resort deadlock.

The new ministers\u2014Kalman Gurung as energy minister, Rameshore Khanal as finance minister, and Om Prakash Aryal as home minister\u2014were sworn in outside a government building that had been attacked and set ablaze by protesters the week before.  The appointments come after violent demonstrations sparked by a brief social media ban and widespread anger over corruption that resulted in at least 72 deaths and hundreds of injuries, leading to the collapse of the previous administration.  Karki, 73, who was appointed on September\u202f12, took office following an agreement with leaders of the largely youth\u2011led \u2018Gen\u202fZ\u2019 protest movement.  The military, which enforced a curfew during the unrest, ultimately consented to her leadership of a caretaker government charged with overseeing elections within six months.  At a conference on Sunday, Karki stated, 'What we need now is to work to end corruption, bring about good governance, and achieve economic equality. This is what the people truly desire at this moment.'

One faction supported former Chief Justice Sushila Karki, who is described in the article as a popular choice for her reputation as 'honest and fearless'; another faction rejected her nomination and instead proposed Kulman Ghising, the former chief of the Nepal Electricity Authority, arguing that appointing Karki would deepen the deadlock because the constitution bars former justices from becoming prime minister.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 11:02 AM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/gen-z-factions-clash-outside-nepal-army-headquarters-amid-leadership-dispute-2785755-2025-09-11)\n\n**After Sushila Karki, Kulman Ghising in the race for Nepal's interim PM post.

Karki\u2019s age (over 70) and constitutional restrictions (Article\u202f132) raise doubts. The Nepal army chief, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, reportedly met with Karki, while army spokesperson Raja Ram Basnet says 'Initial talks are on\u2026 we are trying to normalise the situation.'

The new executive head will have to ensure fresh elections within a specified timeframe, and the army spokesperson did not provide any names.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 10:25 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-president-has-message-amid-talks-with-gen-z-to-pick-interim-pm-sushila-karki-balen-shah-kulman-ghising-options-101757584599327.html)\n\n**'Otherwise, grave misfortune may follow': Nepal ex-PM suggests way out to form new govt**\nFormer Nepal prime minister Baburam Bhattarai urged the country to form a new government within the existing Constitution after Gen\u2011Z protests toppled the coalition of former PM KP Sharma Oli.  He warned that \"Otherwise, grave misfortune may follow,\" and posted the proverb, 'It is harder to deliver the offering to the priest than to perform the funeral rite itself,' to illustrate the difficulty of the process.  Bhattarai criticised unnamed \"self\u2011proclaimed intellectuals\" who called Nepal \"constitutionless or stateless,\" and stressed that the Constitution, Parliament, Head of State and permanent organs remain intact even if the government resigns.  He called for a three\u2011pronged approach: meaningful dialogue between the movement\u2019s official representatives and the President, convening Parliament to make constitutional arrangements, and preventing new parties from resigning from Parliament in a rash manner.  He warned that failure could plunge the nation into \"a terrifying dark tunnel, a Black Hole.\"  The article also noted that Bhattarai\u2019s house was torched amid widespread arson linked to a social media ban, and that interim PM candidates include Kulman Ghising and former chief justice Sushila Karki.

The death toll had risen to 25 and 633 were injured, according to the health ministry. In addition, five juvenile inmates died during a clash with security at a western Nepal jail, and more than 7,000 prisoners escaped from prisons nationwide. Negotiations between representatives and protesters began at the army headquarters, but no succession plan was agreed upon. Tribhuvan International Airport resumed services the same evening, 24 hours after closing. The army deployed armoured personnel carriers and used loudspeakers to call for calm. Former PM Jhala Nath Khanal\u2019s wife, Ravi Laxmi Chitrakar, who sustained serious burn injuries, is critical but stable, as reported by Dr Kiran Nakarmi of Kirtipur Hospital. Nepali Army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel held consultations with stakeholders and met with representatives of the Gen\u202fZ protest movement, according to Rajaram Basnet. Former chief justice Sushila Karki, Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, and former electricity board chief Kulman Ghising were named as potential interim leaders. Karki said, 'Experts need to come together to figure out the way forward' and added, 'When they requested me, I accepted.' The army announced that curfew orders would remain in force until Thursday morning, warning that demonstrations, vandalism, looting, arson, and attacks in the name of protest would be considered punishable crimes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 09:36 PM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/army-out-curfew-clamped-as-nepal-hunts-for-a-new-leader-101757540191643.html)\n\n**After Oli's exit, who will lead Nepal? Inside details of GenZ meeting on Interim Government - The Statesman**\nViolent Gen\u202fZ protests over alleged corruption and nepotism have erupted across Nepal, with demonstrators setting fire to the Parliament building and the residences of the President, Prime Minister and several ministers. Prime Minister KP\u202fSharma\u202fOli resigned amid the unrest, and a meeting of Gen\u202fZ protesters and allies was held on 18\u202fSeptember\u202f2025 at Jangi\u202fAdda, Army Headquarters in Bhadrakali, Kathmandu, to discuss who should lead the interim government. The meeting considered several potential leaders: Kathmandu Mayor Balenndra\u202fShah, former Chief Justice Shushila\u202fKarki (who said 'I am ready to lead the interim government if I have unanimous support'), Sumana\u202fShrestha (who declined due to her affiliation with the Rastriya\u202fSwatantra\u202fParty), Harka\u202fSamparg (Mayor of Dharan), Sagar\u202fDhakal (federal election candidate), Kulman\u202fGhising (former Managing Director of Nepal Electricity Authority), and Rastra\u202fBimochan\u202fTimalsena (YouTuber and lawyer who goes by 'Random Nepali').\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 12:05 PM\nSource:[thestatesman.com](https://www.thestatesman.com/world/after-olis-exit-who-will-lead-nepal-inside-details-of-genz-meeting-on-interim-government-1503484209.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts converge on a low but non-negligible probability (24%) for Kulman Ghising to become the next non-caretaker Prime Minister of Nepal before January 1, 2026. Across political science, regional, and journalism perspectives, the dominant reasoning is as follows:\n\n- The current government is a caretaker regime led by Sushila Karki, whose mandate is to maintain order and organize elections by March 2026. Nepal's constitutional and historical precedents make caretaker governments transitional, with limited authority and little precedent for a caretaker minister, especially a technocratic outsider like Ghising, to ascend directly to the top job.\n- Ghising enjoys high popularity for his technocratic achievements and is viewed favorably by Gen-Z protestors. He has been suggested as a potential compromise figure and commands public goodwill, but does not have an established party base or leadership of a major political faction.\n- Party-based coalition politics and elite-controlled negotiation dominate post-election government formation in Nepal. Technocrats and non-party figures rarely emerge as prime ministers outside moments of extreme deadlock or mass mobilization demanding a consensus outsider.\n- The Gen-Z protest movement added volatility and helped include Ghising as a prominent interim minister, but it remains fragmented, leaderless, and does not appear poised to unify around him or quickly convert influence into parliamentary control.\n- All plausible 'Yes' scenarios involve a rapid collapse or delegitimation of the caretaker arrangement, a major crisis that leaves both parties and Gen-Z unable to agree on an insider, or a unified movement demanding a clean-slate technocrat, leading to Ghising's elevation as a consensus national unity PM. No expert currently sees evidence of such developments.\n- The median and modal probabilities\u201424%\u2014reflect a modest bump from the pure base rate (near zero for such outsider transitions) due to Ghising's exceptional popularity, post-protest volatility, and the slim but real possibility of further institutional crisis, but all experts agree these are outweighed by structural, legal, and procedural constraints.\n\nIn summary: The panel sees Ghising as an outside contender whose odds hover around 1-in-4\u2014not impossible given Nepal's turbulence and his public profile, but well below the most likely outcomes which favor established party leaders or coalition figures post-election.",
