This is precisely how these risks should be weighted given the record and margin involved. Since no new information or argument has surfaced to materially increase the probability of a 'No', and the collective analysis reinforces rather than undermines my assessment, there is no justification to move either up to 100% (which would be overconfident in a contest setting) or down.

No new information suggests any reversal of macro trends, and there is strong cross-validation from macro, financial, and political economy domains. However, detailed critiques highlight that the nonzero risk from acute FX swings, final statistical harmonization, or a data adjustment is slightly underweighted in some maximal-confidence forecasts.

The central bank\u2019s latest forecast shows a 4.55% expansion of the island\u2019s GDP in 2025, up from the 4.45% estimate released by the statistics office in August. Taiwan\u2019s projected per\u2011capita GDP for 2025 is just over US$38,000, still less than half of Singapore\u2019s level, while both Taiwan and South Korea remain ahead of Japan. The article notes that Taiwan\u2019s economy had stagnated after key manufacturers moved to China in the late 1980s, but the pandemic chip shortage and the launch of ChatGPT accelerated demand for semiconductors, boosting TSMC and Foxconn.

The article notes that this surge will pressure oil\u2011exporting economies, especially Saudi Arabia, which must balance declining oil revenues with digital\u2011economy opportunities. Oil prices fell 9.7% between August\u202f2024 and March\u202f2025, with futures averaging $66.9 per barrel in 2025 and $62.4 in 2026, underscoring Saudi diversification. The IMF also reports that AI has quadrupled the added value of its sectors in the US from 2.4% to 3.5% of GDP between 2010 and 2023, and that AI\u2019s future demand could exceed electric\u2011vehicle demand by 1.5\u00d7. Saudi Arabia has excess power generation capacity, driven by rapid growth in solar, wind and green\u2011hydrogen projects, and billions of dollars invested in data centers and cloud infrastructure. If linked to global clean\u2011energy demand, Saudi could become a regional hub for AI and sustainable energy. However, the IMF projects electricity price rises of 8.6% in the US, 5.3% in China and 3.6% in Europe by 2030, requiring substantial local investment to meet domestic demand while supporting global expansion. The article concludes that Saudi can transform from a traditional oil economy to a knowledge\u2011based digital economy by investing effectively in AI and renewable energy.

It lists India\u2019s rapid growth (7\u20117.8\u202f% GDP growth) and its top\u2011five ranking in services exports and top\u2011ten in foreign direct investment (FDI). Bajran highlights recent improvements: nominal GDP rank rose from 6th in 2019 to 4th in 2024 (\u25b2\u202f2 ranks); services export rank improved from 9th to 5th (\u25b2\u202f4 ranks); logistics performance rank moved from 44th (2018) to 38th (2023) (\u25b2\u202f6 ranks); trade as a % of GDP increased from 30.8\u202f% to 40.8\u202f% (\u25b2\u202f10\u202fpp); and ease\u2011of\u2011doing\u2011business rank jumped from 142nd (2014) to 63rd (2020) (\u25b2\u202f79 ranks). The piece also notes areas needing improvement: per\u2011capita income is only about $2,100 (\u2248\u202f148th globally), a skill gap among youth, uneven rural development, a weak innovation ecosystem (rank\u202f39 in the Global Innovation Index), and corruption/red\u2011tape that hampers small businesses. Bajran urges students to focus on per\u2011capita growth, skill development, innovation, rural economy, and global collaboration, and encourages them to use tools like Google Trends, IMF reports, and to raise awareness. He quotes: \u2018When global ranks go up, so should awareness.\u2019, \u2018The real classroom is the world, not just your syllabus.\u2019, and \u2018When you study with pain, your success speaks louder.\u2019\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@innocentbajran/study-with-abdullah-bajran-part-ii-where-india-stands-in-the-global-economy-truth-every-student-88cc1c3b775c)\n\n**The Obstacles to India's Superpower Ambition**\nThe article argues that India\u2019s projected rise to the world\u2019s second\u2011largest economy by 2050 faces deliberate obstacles from the U.S. and its regional rivals. It cites PwC and OECD projections that give India a 70\u201180\u202f% chance of surpassing the U.S. on a PPP basis, with an estimated GDP of $15\u201125\u202ftrillion by mid\u2011century, versus the U.S. growth of 1\u20112\u202f% annually. The piece notes India\u2019s trade surplus with the U.S. reached $45\u202fbillion in 2024, a 5.9\u202f% increase from 2023, and highlights U.S. tariffs on Indian refined petroleum and potential sanctions on Reliance Industries, which earned $5\u202fbillion from Russian oil imports in 2024. It also discusses U.S. policy shifts under President Trump, including a 2025\u201129 term \u201cconfrontational stance\u201d and a possible reduction of Indian H\u20111B visas, which the article claims would curb remittances that support India\u2019s economy. The author further claims that Pakistan, supported by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and China are strategically positioning themselves against India, citing the OIC\u2019s 2020 resolution criticizing India\u2019s Kashmir policies and the Gulf states\u2019 economic ties with India. The article quotes Indian officials, such as \u2018Indians\u2026 received nearly two\u2011thirds of H\u20111B temporary visas for highly skilled workers issued in 2023,\u2019 to illustrate U.S. influence. Overall, the article presents a narrative that U.S. and regional actors are actively creating trade barriers, political pressure, and potential separatist support to slow India\u2019s ascent, framing these actions as a strategic effort to maintain U.S. dominance in the global economy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:58 AM\nSource:[Counter Punch](https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/09/18/the-obstacles-to-indias-superpower-ambition/)\n\n**Insights on Global Conflicts and Economic Forecasts**\nThe article reports on current geopolitical tensions and their economic implications. Fitch recently released estimates showing Italy\u2019s deficit at 3.1% of GDP for 2025\u20112027 and a projected public debt of 137.6% of GDP by 2026, driven in part by the superbonus; this places Italy in a vulnerable position compared with other BBB\u2011rated countries whose average debt is projected at 57.3% in 2024, though Fitch expects a decline in financing risks. The Middle East conflict has intensified, now reaching day 715 of tensions between Israel and Hamas. President Donald Trump described Hamas\u2019s October\u202f7,\u202f2023 attack as a genocide, prompting international reactions. According to the Wall Street Journal, the United States is preparing a $6\u202fbillion arms\u2011sale package for Israel. Israeli forces announced a plan to intensify military use in Gaza City, with Colonel Avichay Adraee urging residents to evacuate to designated humanitarian zones in southern Gaza; Israel has also closed crossings between the West Bank and Jordan. In response, the Global Sumud Flotilla departed from Portopalo, Sicily, carrying aid to Gaza. In Sudan, a paramilitary air attack killed 75 people in a mosque during prayers in a refugee camp in Darfur, amid an ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary groups since April\u202f2023. The war in Ukraine has reached day 1,305. Trump recently labeled a Russian jet incursion into Estonian airspace a serious problem, while Moscow denies violations; NATO reacted by deploying Italian fighters to intercept the Russian aircraft. The European Commission introduced its 19th sanctions package against Russia, targeting payment systems and cryptocurrencies; Ursula von der Leyen declared it time to halt Russian gas supplies, emphasizing a unified EU approach. Russian defense officials denied air\u2011space violations, claiming compliance with international norms, while Estonia sought NATO consultations over the provocations. The article concludes that these geopolitical conflicts significantly affect economic forecasts and international dynamics, underscoring the importance of staying informed for global stability.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 11:14 PM\nSource:[Notizie.it](https://www.notizie.it/approfondimenti-sui-conflitti-mondiali-e-previsioni-economiche-globali/)\n\n**Ajay Bagga on India's $20 Trillion Dream: Coffee Can Investing, Demographic Edge, and Market Growth**\nMarket veteran Ajay Bagga told audiences at the Republic Leadership Conclave that India\u2019s economy, currently about $4\u202ftrillion, could grow to an $18\u201120\u202ftrillion economy by 2047.

He noted that Indian investors bought $53\u202fbillion this year while foreigners sold $16\u202fbillion, underscoring a shift in market ownership. Bagga concluded by highlighting India\u2019s demographic advantage: the average age is 29 years, compared with China\u2019s 43, Europe\u2019s 45 and Japan\u2019s 53, giving India a 20\u201130\u2011year window to reach a $20\u202ftrillion economy.

The upgrade cites India\u2019s demographic dividend, robust domestic demand and sound government policies. R&I said, 'Despite the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment, India\u2019s economy can be expected to maintain firm growth thanks to the economic structures driven by domestic demand and the policies of the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.' This is India\u2019s third rating upgrade this year, following S&P\u2019s upgrade to BBB from BBB\u2011 in August 2025 and Morningstar DBRS\u2019 upgrade to BBB from BBB (low) in May 2025. S&P Global Ratings noted, 'The upgrade of India reflects its buoyant economic growth, against the backdrop of an enhanced monetary policy environment that anchors inflationary expectations.' R&I acknowledged that a 50\u202f% US tariff increase could pose a risk but argued India\u2019s economy is largely driven by domestic factors and its dependence on US exports is low. The agency also highlighted the GST rate rationalisation, reducing slabs from four to two, and said the tax change would likely be offset by stimulation of private consumption. R&I projects India\u2019s GDP growth to remain in the mid\u20116\u202f% range from FY2026 onwards, supported by population growth, income catch\u2011up effects, public investment and government policies. It noted progress in reducing the fiscal deficit, with a target of 4.4\u202f% of GDP in FY2026, and emphasised the need for accelerated growth to achieve a developed\u2011economy status by 2047.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 12:13 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/ri-japan-upgrades-india-sovereign-credit-rating-bbb-plus-125091900864_1.html)\n\n**Japan's R&I upgrades India's currency rating to BBB+; outlook stable**\nJapan's Rating and Investment Information (R&I) upgraded India's foreign\u2011currency rating to BBB+ on Friday, citing steady growth, improving fiscal discipline and stable external finances, and set the outlook to 'stable'. R&I noted that India\u2019s economy is resilient to global risks such as higher U.S. tariffs because it relies mainly on domestic demand, and praised the policies of the Narendra Modi\u2011led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. The agency said, 'Despite the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment, India's economy can be expected to maintain firm growth thanks to the economic structures driven by domestic demand and the policies of the administration of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.' The government welcomed the upgrade, adding, 'The Government of India remains committed to building on this momentum through policies that promote inclusive, high\u2011quality growth alongside fiscal prudence and macroeconomic stability.' This is the third rating agency to raise India\u2019s ratings in the fiscal year after S&P and Morningstar DBRS. India\u2019s economy grew 6.5\u202f% in FY24 and expanded 7.8\u202f% in the April\u2011June 2025 quarter. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects growth of about 6.5\u202f% this year, supported by strong domestic demand, business investment and government spending. India's fiscal deficit narrowed to 4.8\u202f% of GDP in FY24 and is targeted at 4.4\u202f% in FY25, helped by higher tax revenues and lower subsidies. The current\u2011account deficit remains modest at under 1\u202f% of GDP, while foreign\u2011exchange reserves are strong. The government overhauled the Goods and Services Tax (GST), reducing the 12\u202f% and 28\u202f% slabs, and has asked businesses to pass the benefit to customers to boost consumer demand. RBI has cut the repo rate by 100 basis points since February, before pausing in August, signalling a focus on boosting demand amid low inflation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 11:21 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/japan-s-r-i-upgrades-india-s-currency-rating-to-bbb-outlook-stable-125091900776_1.html)\n\n**Taiwan Surpasses Korea in Key Wealth Indicator, Thanks to TSMC**\nTaiwan is projected to surpass South Korea in per\u2011capita GDP in 2025, ahead of the IMF\u2019s April forecast, largely due to the rise of TSMC and the global AI boom. The central bank\u2019s latest forecast shows a 4.55% expansion of the island\u2019s GDP in 2025, up from the 4.45% estimate released by the statistics office in August. Taiwan\u2019s projected per\u2011capita GDP for 2025 is just over US$38,000, still less than half of Singapore\u2019s level, while both Taiwan and South Korea remain ahead of Japan. The article notes that Taiwan\u2019s economy had stagnated after key manufacturers moved to China in the late 1980s, but the pandemic chip shortage and the launch of ChatGPT accelerated demand for semiconductors, boosting TSMC and Foxconn.

The article notes that this surge will pressure oil\u2011exporting economies, especially Saudi Arabia, which must balance declining oil revenues with digital\u2011economy opportunities. Oil prices fell 9.7% between August\u202f2024 and March\u202f2025, with futures averaging $66.9 per barrel in 2025 and $62.4 in 2026, underscoring Saudi diversification. The IMF also reports that AI has quadrupled the added value of its sectors in the US from 2.4% to 3.5% of GDP between 2010 and 2023, and that AI\u2019s future demand could exceed electric\u2011vehicle demand by 1.5\u00d7. Saudi Arabia has excess power generation capacity, driven by rapid growth in solar, wind and green\u2011hydrogen projects, and billions of dollars invested in data centers and cloud infrastructure. If linked to global clean\u2011energy demand, Saudi could become a regional hub for AI and sustainable energy. However, the IMF projects electricity price rises of 8.6% in the US, 5.3% in China and 3.6% in Europe by 2030, requiring substantial local investment to meet domestic demand while supporting global expansion. The article concludes that Saudi can transform from a traditional oil economy to a knowledge\u2011based digital economy by investing effectively in AI and renewable energy.

It lists India\u2019s rapid growth (7\u20117.8\u202f% GDP growth) and its top\u2011five ranking in services exports and top\u2011ten in foreign direct investment (FDI). Bajran highlights recent improvements: nominal GDP rank rose from 6th in 2019 to 4th in 2024 (\u25b2\u202f2 ranks); services export rank improved from 9th to 5th (\u25b2\u202f4 ranks); logistics performance rank moved from 44th (2018) to 38th (2023) (\u25b2\u202f6 ranks); trade as a % of GDP increased from 30.8\u202f% to 40.8\u202f% (\u25b2\u202f10\u202fpp); and ease\u2011of\u2011doing\u2011business rank jumped from 142nd (2014) to 63rd (2020) (\u25b2\u202f79 ranks). The piece also notes areas needing improvement: per\u2011capita income is only about $2,100 (\u2248\u202f148th globally), a skill gap among youth, uneven rural development, a weak innovation ecosystem (rank\u202f39 in the Global Innovation Index), and corruption/red\u2011tape that hampers small businesses. Bajran urges students to focus on per\u2011capita growth, skill development, innovation, rural economy, and global collaboration, and encourages them to use tools like Google Trends, IMF reports, and to raise awareness.

It notes that India now has the world\u2019s fourth\u2011largest military and the fifth\u2011largest economy, and that it has pursued a robust defence upgrade programme. The piece cites Henry Kissinger\u2019s observation that \u2018India will be a fulcrum of twenty\u2011first\u2011century order \u2026.\u2019 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s 2023 G20 remarks that \u2018India mainstreamed the Global South\u2019s concerns in the International discourse and has ushered in an era where developing countries take their rightful place in shaping the global narrative.\u2019\n\nIndia\u2019s economic performance is underscored by a 7.2\u202f% GDP growth in fiscal 2023, a figure praised by the IMF and World Bank, and by savings of about $2.7\u202fbillion on oil imports from Russia between January and September 2023, which helped curb inflation. India is the world\u2019s third\u2011largest crude\u2011oil importer, accounting for roughly 35\u202f% of its total import bill.\n\nThe article contrasts China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with India\u2019s proposed India\u2011Middle East\u2011Europe economic corridor, arguing that the latter offers lower logistics costs, reduced carbon emissions, and a more viable alternative to the BRI\u2019s socio\u2011environmental and governance risks. It notes that Italy withdrew from the BRI and that several BRI participants, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, face debt\u2011trap concerns.\n\nIndia\u2019s diplomatic stance on the Russo\u2011Ukrainian conflict is described as a \u201ctight\u2011rope walking\u201d strategy: it condemns civilian casualties but refrains from openly criticizing Russia, while urging both sides to pursue diplomacy. The article stresses India\u2019s balanced ties with Russia and the United States, and its broader engagement with multilateral bodies such as BRICS, the EU, SCO, ASEAN, and SAARC.\n\nOverall, the piece portrays India as a model for the Global South, combining democratic governance, military strength, and economic growth to play a pivotal role in shaping a new global order that includes Europe.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 01:50 PM\nSource:[theweek.in](https://www.theweek.in/news/defence/2025/09/17/strategic-autonomy-and-economic-might-india-and-the-changing-order-in-europe.html)\n\n**The Obstacles to India's Superpower Ambition**\nThe article argues that India\u2019s projected rise to the world\u2019s second\u2011largest economy by 2050 faces deliberate obstacles from the U.S. and its regional rivals. It cites PwC and OECD projections that give India a 70\u201180\u202f% chance of surpassing the U.S. on a PPP basis, with an estimated GDP of $15\u201125\u202ftrillion by mid\u2011century, versus the U.S. growth of 1\u20112\u202f% annually. The piece notes India\u2019s trade surplus with the U.S. reached $45\u202fbillion in 2024, a 5.9\u202f% increase from 2023, and highlights U.S. tariffs on Indian refined petroleum and potential sanctions on Reliance Industries, which earned $5\u202fbillion from Russian oil imports in 2024. It also discusses U.S. policy shifts under President Trump, including a 2025\u201129 term \u201cconfrontational stance\u201d and a possible reduction of Indian H\u20111B visas, which the article claims would curb remittances that support India\u2019s economy. The author further claims that Pakistan, supported by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and China are strategically positioning themselves against India, citing the OIC\u2019s 2020 resolution criticizing India\u2019s Kashmir policies and the Gulf states\u2019 economic ties with India. The article quotes Indian officials, such as \u2018Indians\u2026 received nearly two\u2011thirds of H\u20111B temporary visas for highly skilled workers issued in 2023,\u2019 to illustrate U.S. influence. Overall, the article presents a narrative that U.S. and regional actors are actively creating trade barriers, political pressure, and potential separatist support to slow India\u2019s ascent, framing these actions as a strategic effort to maintain U.S. dominance in the global economy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:58 AM\nSource:[Counter Punch](https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/09/18/the-obstacles-to-indias-superpower-ambition/)\n\n**India to become 4th largest economy by end of 2025: NITI Member Arvind Virmani**\nNITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani stated that India is on track to become the fourth largest economy in the world by the end of 2025, surpassing Japan.

    "summary": "All experts across diverse fields\u2014including macroeconomics, international finance, political economy, and area studies\u2014overwhelmingly forecast that India will surpass Japan in nominal GDP by the end of 2025, as measured by the IMF World Economic Outlook. Recent IMF projections, official statements (including from India\u2019s NITI Aayog and the IMF itself), and major credit rating agencies all report India has either narrowly overtaken or is on the verge of overtaking Japan, with the projected gap for 2025 extremely slim (often less than $1 billion on $4+ trillion GDPs). Key consensus factors increasing the probability for a 'Yes' outcome are India\u2019s robust nominal and real GDP growth (~6% or higher), demographic and domestic demand tailwinds, favorable currency dynamics (stable rupee versus a weak yen), and ongoing structural stagnation and negative demographics in Japan. Experts note the precedent that when such overtakes occur in IMF/official data, reversals are historically very rare unless there are sharp currency swings or major shocks. \n\nThe primary risk noted by all is the razor-thin margin: even small late-year exchange rate movements (especially sudden yen appreciation or rupee depreciation), IMF data revisions, or exogenous macroeconomic shocks could technically flip the order. However, experts stress these scenarios are highly improbable given current trends and see a final probability of 97\u201399% that India will be ranked ahead of Japan in 2025\u2019s IMF figures. Most assign the remaining risk only to tail-risk revision or extreme currency volatility.\n\nIn summary, the expert consensus is that India\u2019s nominal GDP will surpass Japan\u2019s in IMF data for the end of 2025, barring a rare, unexpected late shock or revision.",
