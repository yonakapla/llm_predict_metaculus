According to the presidential advisor and spokesperson for the Council of Ministers, Mohamed El-Hamzawy, 400,000 new housing units will be offered after Eid al-Fitr 2025. The units will be available at competitive prices and will be delivered within 24 months at the latest. El-Hamzawy emphasized that this project represents a real opportunity for low- and middle-income individuals to obtain housing units at affordable prices and with excellent specifications, thanks to the continued support of the state in providing decent housing for citizens. He also highlighted the ongoing policy of rationalizing spending within the economic reform plan launched in March 2024, which prioritizes resources for high-priority projects in the health, education, and decent life sectors.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 08:59 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062c\u0632](https://www.elmogaz.com/827759)\n\n**Project 2025: A Blueprint for Trump's Second Term**\nProject 2025 is an initiative by The Heritage Foundation, aimed at preparing a conservative administration for a possible return of Donald Trump or another Republican to the White House after the 2024 presidential elections. The project's main goals include creating a political manifesto, 'Mandate for Leadership', which outlines a detailed plan for reforming the US government. The plan proposes to eliminate the Department of Education, significantly reduce the Department of Justice and the FBI, and limit the powers of the administrative apparatus. The project also aims to create a personnel reserve for the federal government. The authors of the project, including former Trump administration officials, have been working on the plan since April 2022. Donald Trump has distanced himself from the project during the election campaign, but his actions as president have been consistent with the project's principles. The project's authors are now in power, and their ideas are being implemented. The project's goals include expanding the president's powers, 'breaking the bureaucracy', and eliminating dissenting government officials. The project has been criticized by Democrats, who see it as a threat to democracy. The project's authors claim that it is a new form of democracy, but experts are skeptical. 'Project 2025 is a roadmap for Trump's second term, designed to scare the American people,' said analyst Bill Press. 'Trump is starting at full speed, but only because the 'Project 2025' team has written the script for him. And Democrats can only sigh and say, 'We warned you,' ' added Press.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 01:04 PM\nSource:[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439](https://ua.korrespondent.net/articles/4763886-proiekt-2025-nova-demokratiia-vid-trampa)\n\n**Project 2025: A Blueprint for Trump's Second Term**\nProject 2025 is an initiative of The Heritage Foundation, aimed at preparing a conservative administration for a possible return of Donald Trump or another Republican to the White House after the 2024 presidential elections. The project's main goals include: creating a political manifesto called 'Mandate for Leadership', which contains a detailed plan for reforming the US government; establishing a personnel reserve ('Presidential Personnel Database'); and implementing social-conservative reforms, such as restricting abortion rights and protecting 'traditional family values'. Analyst Vladislav Faraponov notes that the project was developed in April 2022. 'This document is permeated with the idea that the establishment, the so-called Deep State, has always been more sympathetic to Democrats. Therefore, the key idea of the project is to increase the subordination of the executive branch to the president, effectively eliminating the independence of the executive branch in implementing policy.' The project is not an official part of Trump's campaign, but its ideas align with his policy. Many of Trump's supporters were involved in the project's development. Trump has denied any involvement with the project, but analysis by CNN shows that 36 out of 53 of his executive orders and actions in the first week of his presidency align with the project's proposals. Analyst Bill Press writes that Trump's actions are fully consistent with the three main principles of Project 2025: acting quickly, expanding the president's powers, and 'breaking the bureaucracy'. Press notes that Trump has already implemented 2/3 of what he planned for his first 100 days, and that the project's authors are now in power. 'Trump has started at full speed - but only because the team behind Project 2025 scripted the whole scenario for him.

The 1st of April is expected to be the date when the definitive allocation of places will be communicated. The Summer Campus will start on June 23rd and end on August 29th. Due to the high demand, the allocation of places will be done through a lottery in front of a notary, scheduled for March 20th. The 37% of pre-registrations come from children and teenagers from outside Pamplona. The Summer Campus is an educational project that proposes a transversal theme, which in 2025 will be the circular economy. The project will work through a complete program of activities adapted to each age group, focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The values developed in the Summer Campus are companionship, responsibility, respect, cooperation, critical thinking, healthy habits, and autonomy, among others. Fundaci\u00f3n Caja Navarra explained that they use a participatory and experiential methodology, emphasizing the importance of immersive experiences that allow different types of learning, both in relation to pedagogical content and personal growth and social skills. The entity added that their learning is based on discovery, practical experience, motivation, and cooperative work, using games as a learning resource.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 10:45 AM\nSource:[COPE | Noticias y radio online](https://www.cope.es/emisoras/navarra/noticias/campus-verano-hondarribia-recibe-doble-preinscripciones-plazas-sorteo-notario-20250314_3113021.html)\n\n**Ministry Takes First Step Towards Electrifying AVE Track in Cantabria**\nThe Ministry of Transport has taken the first step towards electrifying and installing the AVE track in Cantabria. If the planned deadlines are met, the works on the five Palencia sections that separate the provincial capital and Alar del Rey will be completed by April 2026. However, this does not mean that high-speed trains can start running immediately. The Ministry's work, although the most important part of the project, only serves to create the railway track by raising the structures and building the platform - several dozen meters wide along the 78 kilometers of the route - on which the AVE will fly. When this is finished, the track still needs to be electrified and the tracks and catenary installed. To have everything ready when the time comes and not have to wait any longer than necessary, ADIF has already tendered the redaction of the following phases of its construction: electrification and the construction of the base from which the installation of the track will be carried out in the first five sections. ADIF has also licited the project for the connection of Nogales, which will allow the Palencia-Alar del Rey section to be put into service once it is completed, and continue to Santander by conventional line by 2030, while the high-speed section Alar del Rey-Reinosa is completed by 2033, with an estimated travel time to Madrid of three hours from Santander.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 06:27 AM\nSource:[El Diario Monta\u00f1es](https://www.eldiariomontanes.es/cantabria/adif-licita-redaccion-proyectos-electrificar-colocar-via-20250314163107-nt.html)\n\n**MSME Announces Recruitment for 2025 Startup-Focused University Support Project**\nThe Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) announced that it will recruit 773 pre-startup entrepreneurs and startup companies for the 2025 'Startup-Focused University Support Project' from March 21 to April 2. The project aims to support regional and university startups through 'startup-focused universities' that have excellent startup support capabilities. This year, two additional universities (Chungbuk National University and Jeonnam National University) have been designated, bringing the total number of startup-focused universities to 11. The selected companies will receive business development funds and investment attraction, as well as a startup capability enhancement program. The startup-focused universities will support startups in three types: general type, regional industry-linked type, and first-time young pre-startup track. The general type supports startups within the region, providing business development funds (up to 200 million KRW) and startup support programs. The regional industry-linked type supports startups in designated regional industries, providing business development funds (up to 200 million KRW) and connecting the university's research equipment and infrastructure. The first-time young pre-startup track is a dedicated track for young pre-startup entrepreneurs under the age of 29, providing business development funds (up to 100 million KRW) and university-specific startup support programs. Applications and submissions can be made through the K-Startup website until April 2 at 4pm. After submission, the final selection will be made through document review and presentation evaluation. 'We will actively utilize the human resources, equipment, and infrastructure possessed by universities to support regional startups and play a leading role in the regional startup ecosystem through the connection with regional industries,' said Jo Kyung-won, Director of Startup Policy at MSME.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 09:02 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250313_0003097940)\n\n**Details of the Medium Housing Project in the 10th of Ramadan City**\nThe head of the development agency of the 10th of Ramadan city, Engineer Alaa Abdel-Latif Mustafa, announced the details and rates of implementation of the medium housing project in the city.

The tracker takes a big-picture approach, showing how closely Trump's second term aligns with the project's policy goals. Cobb, an archaeologist and administrator of the r/Keep_Track subreddit, initially created a spreadsheet to track the Trump administration's progress on Project 2025 initiatives, which gained traction on her subreddit.

The tracker, which monitors 297 objectives recommended by the Heritage Foundation, has found that Trump has achieved 88% of the objectives put before the Executive Office of the President. The tracker also highlights the administration's efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Education, and has deemed the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) fully finished by Project 2025.

Some users express concern about the long-term impact of these actions, while others are impressed by the administration's ability to accomplish so much in a short time. However, one user notes that this is similar to setting a yard on fire to get rid of weeds, and that the long-term consequences of such actions should be considered.

The project provides 24-week customized health management services to adults with health risks through a mobile app and activity tracker. The participants will undergo health check-ups and consultations at the health center every 8 weeks. The health check-up items include fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, waist circumference, BMI, and body composition. The selected participants will also receive a customized health lifestyle support service, nutrition and obesity management, physical activity, smoking cessation, and monthly health habit reports and evaluations. However, if they fail to participate in the service for 2 weeks or more, or do not complete the final health survey, or damage or lose the activity tracker, they will be disqualified. Additionally, the county has selected Gokseong Cooperative as the supplier of organic agricultural products for school meals. The project aims to purchase organic agricultural products for school meals, with a budget of 380 million won this year. 32 schools, including kindergartens, elementary, middle, and high schools, will be the target of the project.

This is in contrast to over 170 countries that have failed to submit 'nationally determined contributions' (NDCs), leading to concerns about the world's commitment to keeping warming below 2C. The UK's commitment is a 'bright spot' amidst a sense of backsliding, with the US, Argentina, Russia, and New Zealand considering pulling out of the agreement.

The U.N. climate chief, Simon Stiell, is not worried, stating that more than 170 countries are working on their plans and that quality is more important than timeliness. However, Champa Patel, policy director of the Climate Group, expressed concern that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment. The plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), are crucial for the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists warn that the warming atmosphere is driving extreme weather events, and the new targets should cover all greenhouse gases and the entire economy. Climate Action Tracker found that four of the six NDC targets they analyzed got an 'almost sufficient' rating, while Switzerland's plan was rated insufficient, and the U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming. The real deadline for the plans is in September, when the U.N. will tally up all the plans and determine how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 08:18 PM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-10/nations-miss-deadline-climate-change)\n\n**Uljin-gun to Recruit Participants for 2025 Mobile Healthcare Project**\nUljin-gun is recruiting 100 participants for the '2025 Mobile Healthcare Project' from February 7 to 28.
