He faces minimal internal resistance and is ideologically motivated to both reward allies and provoke his critics. The base rate for other presidents is negligible for such activity, but Trump's unique approach and current context (including the replacement of pardon officials with loyalists and explicit statements indicating more to come) make a 'Yes' outcome strongly favored.

A Guide to His Most Recent Pardons, Including 2 Reality Stars, a Rapper and a Gang Leader**\nSince taking office for the second time on January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump has issued several federal pardons and commutations to individuals convicted of federal crimes.

Trump's decision to pardon Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff, and reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, convicted of a multimillion dollar fraud and tax evasion scheme, is part of a 'broader pattern' for the White House, said NBC News. The pardons are 'de-emphasizing public corruption cases,' especially those connected to the DOJ's Public Integrity Section, and are 'targeting Biden-era prosecutions that rankled conservatives,' said The Wall Street Journal. Former Pardon Attorney Liz Oyer said that many of the pardons are 'happening in secret' and are 'really different' from those in Trump's first term, which included several 'truly deserving individuals who were more along the lines of ordinary Americans who did benefit from pardons.' Trump's decision to pardon these individuals is 'pretty clear,' said CNN: It focuses on people who 'support Trump or have ties to him,' those who have attacked people who Trump considers enemies, and those for whom the pardons 'send messages to key constituencies.' The latest crop of pardon recipients shows that Trump is attempting to 'redefine' presidential amnesty powers, said The New York Times. 'No MAGA left behind,' said Ed Martin, the newly installed DOJ Pardon Attorney, in a post on X after arranging Jenkins' pardon. 'Individuals who do not have political connections can still have their applications considered,' said Oyer to PBS, but Trump's rejection of that traditional process means there is 'no path forward that we know of right now for ordinary people to be considered for clemency.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 05:31 PM\nSource:[The Week](https://theweek.com/politics/trump-pardon-martin-chrisley-public-integrity)\n\n**Rapper NBA YoungBoy, Ex-Chicago Gang Leader Win Trump Clemency**\nPresident Donald Trump is offering clemency to a diverse group of individuals, including NBA YoungBoy, a rap artist, Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Gangster Disciples street gang, and Michael 'Harry O' Harris, a music executive who helped found Death Row Records.

Ed Martin, the pardon attorney for Trump's second-term DOJ, is reportedly driven by a 'no MAGA left behind' policy to free far-right activists. MAGA is also pushing for Trump to pardon former Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering George Floyd in 2020, and Tina Peters, who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for allowing a man affiliated with MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell to access Mesa County's election systems. Former DOJ pardon attorney Liz Oyer has condemned the second Trump administration's pardon process, saying it involves getting access to someone close to Trump and making a pitch on how the convicted felon was the victim of a politically motivated prosecution. Oyer stated, 'In the current administration, there is no path forward that we know of right now for ordinary people to be considered for clemency.' She also noted that the president is granting clemency to individuals who owe tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution and fines and other financial penalties, a practice that has never been done by any other president.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 10:49 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/shocking-and-striking-here-s-who-maga-wants-in-trump-s-next-pardon-spree/)\n\n**Rapper NBA YoungBoy, Ex-Chicago Gang Leader Win Trump Clemency**\nPresident Donald Trump is offering clemency to a diverse group of individuals, including NBA YoungBoy, a rap artist, Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Gangster Disciples street gang, and Michael 'Harry O' Harris, a music executive who helped found Death Row Records.

The pardons and commutations coincide with the installation of Ed Martin as the Justice Department's new pardon attorney. Critics have pointed out that most of the recipients are vocal Trump supporters, and some have raised concerns about the ethics and legality of the pardons. However, Trump defenders have noted that President Biden also issued a slew of controversial clemency actions before leaving office. Trump has signaled that more pardons could be coming, including a possible pardon for two men convicted of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 07:36 PM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/may/28/trump-launches-clemency-spree/)\n\n**Trump pardons criminals with MAGA credentials or big money**\nUS President Trump has continued his trend of granting clemency to political loyalists and those with significant financial resources.

Trump's pardons have been met with delight from his 'Maga' acolytes and conservative lawmakers, who previously criticized former President Joe Biden for his last-minute pardons of family members and allies. The pardons have raised concerns that the justice department is de-emphasizing cases of fraud and public corruption, and that Trump is stretching the limits of presidential pardon power. 'Pardoning a sheriff who took cash for deputy badges is just the latest in a string of actions this president has taken to undermine any effort to hold officials accountable to the public they are sworn to serve,' said Stacey Young, a former justice department official. Trump's use of pardons has been described as 'not at all how pardons normally work' by Liz Oyer, the former pardon attorney, who noted that the president is granting clemency to individuals who owe tens of millions of dollars in restitution and fines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 04:10 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/28/trump-pardon-power)\n\n**Trump's Pardon Business: A Lucrative Industry**\nSince taking office, President Trump has granted pardons or commutations to approximately 1,600 individuals, a number six times higher than his first term but still far lower than President Biden's 4,245 in four years. Most of Trump's pardons in his second term have been for those charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot. Others include wealthy white-collar offenders, anti-abortion activists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, and two former assistants to Hunter Biden, who accused him of corruption. Trevor Milton, the founder of Nikola Corp., was granted a full pardon after being convicted of securities fraud. Milton's lawyer, Mark Mukasey, said that the pardon was a 'testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students.' The pardon process has become a lucrative business, with lawyers and lobbyists charging tens of thousands of dollars to help clients navigate the system. Some have even hired high-profile lawyers, such as Rudy Giuliani and Alan Dershowitz, to help them secure pardons. 'It's a big business,' said Liz Oyer, a former chief pardon attorney at the Justice Department. 'People are willing to pay a lot of money to get a pardon.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8j9pOQN8NYF)\n\n**Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official**\nFormer pardon attorney Liz Oyer claims that Donald Trump's recent wave of pardoning white-collar criminals has erased more than '$1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans' to the public purse. According to Oyer, 'when you're convicted of a financial crime like fraud or embezzlement, the law requires you to pay back the money that you stole. It's called restitution.' However, Trump's pardons can 'wipe out your entire sentence including your obligation to pay back the money.' Oyer alleges that 'in total, Donald Trump has granted pardons that have wiped out over $1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law.' This includes the case of Michele Fiore, a former Republican politician from Nevada, who was convicted of wire fraud and had an estimated restitution amount of over $680m. Oyer also notes that some of Trump's pardon recipients had not yet been sentenced, so their owed amounts had not been finalized by the courts. Oyer said it was 'unprecedented for a president to grant pardons that have the effect of wiping out so much debt owed by people who have committed frauds'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 02, 2025 03:49 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n**Fired DOJ attorney says on TikTok that Trump pardons cost $1 billion**\nLiz Oyer, the recently fired pardon attorney at the Justice Department, claims that President Donald Trump's pardons of people convicted of white-collar crimes have cost Americans $1 billion. Oyer arrived at this number by adding up the restitution amounts that the pardon recipients allegedly owed to their victims. She argues that Trump's pardons are unusual because they often wipe out large amounts of debt owed by people who have committed frauds, and that this is not in line with Justice Department standards. Oyer points to several examples, including the pardon of Trevor Milton, who was convicted of stealing over $680 million from defrauded shareholders, and Michele Fiore, who was convicted of taking money meant to honor slain police officers and using it for personal expenses. The White House has defended Trump's pardons, but Oyer believes that they are a significant break from the traditional pardon application process.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 01, 2025 11:42 PM\nSource:[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/01/liz-oyer-trump-pardons-restitution-1-billion/)\n\n**Trump Says He'll Stop Health Care Fraudsters. Last Time, He Let Them Walk.**\nFormer President Trump has claimed to prioritize combating health care fraud, but his history of granting pardons and commutations to convicted fraudsters contradicts this statement. In his first and second terms, Trump granted clemency to at least 68 people convicted of fraud crimes, including 13 individuals involved in cases worth over $1.6 billion. Trump also fired 17 independent inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud and waste in government. In one notable case, Trump commuted the sentence of Philip Esformes, a Florida health care executive convicted of a $1.3 billion Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme, and Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor who defrauded Medicare of $42 million. Trump's leniency towards convicted health care fraudsters may discourage DOJ employees from pursuing similar investigations, according to Jerry Martin, a former U.S. attorney and whistleblower advocate. 'It sends a really bad message and really hurts DOJ efforts at creating deterrence,' said Jacob Elberg, a former assistant U.S. attorney. 'In order to reduce health care fraud, you need people both to be afraid of getting in trouble, but also for people to believe in the legitimacy of the system.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 05, 2025 04:41 AM\nSource:[healthleadersmedia.com](https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/ceo/trump-says-hell-stop-health-care-fraudsters-last-time-he-let-them-walk)\n\n**DOJ Attorney Liz Oyer Said Trump Fired Her Over Mel Gibson's Guns  --  Turns Out She Was Mega-Progressive Activist**\nDOJ Attorney Liz Oyer claimed she was fired by President Trump's administration over a gun rights dispute with Mel Gibson, but it appears she was actually a progressive activist who oversaw President Biden's commutations of violent criminals and pushed for left-wing criminal justice initiatives. Oyer's office reviewed applications for clemency and provided recommendations for Biden's pardons and commutations, including those of murderers, drug traffickers, and fraudsters. She advocated for considering 'systemic racial disparities' in making recommendations, and Biden eventually granted her wish by appointing her as pardon attorney. Oyer also penned an op-ed outlining how Biden could tackle 'systemic racism' and advocated for trusting public defenders over prosecutors on criminal justice reform. 'We cannot prosecute our way out of the crisis of mass incarceration,' Oyer wrote. Biden commuted the sentences of thousands of convicted criminals, including 2,500 people in his final days as president, and granted clemency to infamous fraudsters and death row inmates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 27, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[The Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2025/03/27/elizabeth-oyer-pam-bondi-department-justice-mel-gibson/)\n\n**Sensing Opportunity, White-Collar Criminals Vie for Trump Pardons | Common Dreams**\nWith President Donald Trump's second term, white-collar criminals are sensing an opportunity for pardons. According to a consultant who has advised white-collar convicts, 'everybody that is in prison now is keenly aware of the environment, and it's become a very hot topic within the low- and minimum-security inmate communities.' Trump has already issued pardons and commutations for over 1,500 rioters convicted in connection to the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol and pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Those angling for clemency include individuals like jailed crypto titan Sam Bankman-Fried, former Sen. Bob Menendez, and a member of the music group the Fugees. According to The New York Times, clemency petitioners are 'tailoring their pitches to the president by emphasizing their loyalty to him and echoing his claims of political persecution.' For example, a lawyer representing conservative reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley wrote that their conviction for bank fraud and tax evasion 'exemplifies the weaponization of justice against conservatives and public figures.' Some, like Menendez, have made themselves out to be the victims of the 'corrupt' justice system. Rachel Barkow, a professor at New York University School of Law, said that Trump's use of clemency in his second term 'has the potential for corruption is higher' because they're starting early and have figured out how to set it up so that people have a pipeline to get to them.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 10:23 PM\nSource:[Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/trump-clemency-white-collar-criminals)\n\n**DOJ Fired the Pardon Attorney Who Released Murderers**\nLiz Oyer, the pardon attorney who advised Joe Biden to grant clemency to over 1500 convicts, including violent murderers, was fired by Donald Trump's Department of Justice. Oyer wrote on LinkedIn, 'I'm sad to share that I was fired today from the job I have poured my heart and soul into for the last three years.' Todd Blanche signed the order. The move comes after Biden's mass pardons, including those of his son and multiple members of his corrupt family, as well as Anthony Fauci and Mark Miley.

One of them is Liz Oyer, who has been serving as the pardon attorney since 2022. In a memo shared on LinkedIn, Oyer stated that she was 'immediately effective' in her termination. The memo also cited Trump's executive authority under the US Constitution. Oyer previously reviewed federal inmates' clemency requests and advised the White House on who should be pardoned by the president. Additionally, Bobak Talebian, the head of the Office of Information Policy, was also fired. This office is responsible for handling public records requests under the US Freedom of Information Act. This is the latest move by the Trump administration to fire or push out career officials at the Department of Justice, who typically retain their positions under previous presidents. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump's appointees have already reassigned several senior national security and criminal prosecutors to the newly established Immigration Office. Prior to the Senate's approval of Trump's nominee Kash Patel as FBI director, around eight high-ranking FBI career officials were forced to resign.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 03:57 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E9%9B%B7%E5%8E%B2%E9%A2%A8%E8%A1%8C-%E7%BE%8E%E5%8F%B8%E6%B3%95%E9%83%A8%E5%86%8D%E5%82%B3%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%A4%E8%81%B7%E6%A5%AD%E5%AE%98%E5%93%A1%E9%81%AD%E9%96%8B%E9%99%A4-034058072.html)\n\n**Trump fires two DOJ senior career officials including pardon attorney**\nDonald Trump's administration fired two senior career officials at the US Justice Department, including Liz Oyer, the head of the Office of the Pardon Attorney, who was appointed by President Biden in 2022.

Oyer revealed in a LinkedIn post that she was 'sad to share that I was fired today from the job I have poured my heart and soul into for the last three years.' The Office of the Pardon Attorney advises the President in the exercise of executive clemency, and Oyer was largely responsible for allowing President Biden to grant thousands of pardons, including to violent offenders. This includes the commutation of sentences for approximately 1500 convicts during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2500 convicts in January, and dozens of serial killers, rapists, and cop killers. It is unclear what Oyer knew about these pardons, but she expressed gratitude for her time in the position and praised her team for their work.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 01:25 AM\nSource:[The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2025/03/just-trump-doj-fires-pardon-attorney-who-was/)\n\n**Biden's Commutations Spark Anger and Dismay Within the US Department of Justice**\nUS President Joe Biden's decision to commute the sentences of over 2,500 prisoners convicted of non-violent drug-related crimes has sparked 'anger and dismay' within the US Department of Justice, as they felt that the decision was made without their input and included individuals with 'heinous pasts', according to sources familiar with the matter. Biden announced the commutations on January 17, three days before leaving office, stating that these prisoners had served longer sentences than they would have under current law, policy, and practice. He also claimed that he had commuted and reduced the sentences of more people than any other US president. However, a confidential internal memo sent by the Department of Justice's pardon attorney, Elizabeth Oyer, to prosecutors across the country on January 18, revealed that only 258 individuals (around 10%) from the list of those whose sentences were commuted by Biden were recommended by the department. The memo also stated that 'individuals prone to violence who do not meet the department's standards for pardon recommendations' were included in the list. Oyer wrote in the memo, 'Although I firmly believe in the possibility of a second chance through pardon, the process by which yesterday's action was carried out was not as we had hoped and fought for. ... I understand that some pardon decisions are very disappointing.' The White House press secretary, Kelly Magsamen, declined to comment on the matter. Former Trump administration official, Mark Meadows, criticized Biden's decision, stating that he had commuted his own sentence, as well as that of his family members, without going through the proper channels. The WSJ notes that the commutations allowed some individuals to be released within days, while others remained in prison. Some of those whose sentences were commuted had also been charged with serious crimes unrelated to drug trafficking, including gang-related offenses, sexual assault, and conspiracy to commit murder.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:59 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/02/02/2025/679f688b9a79477de2243c69)\n\n**Jan. 6 defendants granted blanket clemency by Trump push for more - Washington Examiner**\nJan. 6 defendants, including Stewart Rhodes and Christopher Quaglin, attended the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland. Rhodes, who received a commutation from Trump, expressed disappointment that he was not given a full pardon and plans to pursue legal action over his conviction. Quaglin, who received a full pardon, wants to be part of the 'solution' from the Trump administration in fixing the prison system. The defendants received a warm reception at the conference, with some attendees calling for accountability from government officials who investigated the Capitol riot. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon praised the Jan. 6 defendants during his address to CPAC, suggesting that they should be honored at the Kennedy Center. However, the pardons received swift blowback from Democrats and some disagreement from Republicans, with Sen. Lindsey Graham criticizing the pardons citing violence against law enforcement. 'I need my veterans benefits restored,' Rhodes said. 'I got a really nasty letter from the VA saying that, because of my conviction, I'm no longer eligible for any disability payments or healthcare, or I can no longer be buried in a veteran cemetery, which is a really horrific insult to a veteran.' Quaglin said, 'I don't care if you're left or right. The prison system is broken. What they did to me is unAmerican.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 09:35 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3326249/january-6-defendants-granted-trump-clemency-push-more/)\n\n**Justice Department broadens Trump's Jan. 6 clemency as it moves to drop gun cases**\nThe Justice Department has broadened President Donald Trump's clemency for Jan. 6 rioters to include unrelated crimes discovered during FBI searches. This move allows prosecutors to drop gun charges against two former Jan. 6 defendants, Daniel Ball and Elias Costianes, citing Trump's Day 1 executive order granting mass clemency to Jan. 6 defendants. The order issued pardons to roughly 1,500 people who had been convicted of 'offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol' on Jan. 6, 2021. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Bornstein wrote in a filing, 'After consulting with the Department of Justice's leadership, the United States has concluded that the President pardoned Mr. Costianes of the offenses in the indictment.' The Justice Department's new position marks the latest push by the new administration to absolve Jan. 6 defendants, whom Trump and his supporters have described as political prisoners and victims of persecution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 12:51 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/justice-department-broadens-trump-jan-004157979.html)\n\n**Pardons And Commutations Are Suddenly Vogue**\nThe presidential pardon is a powerful tool for executive clemency, granting the President of the United States the authority to forgive federal offenses and restore rights and privileges. Since Donald Trump took office, thousands of pardons and commutations have taken place, with Trump pardoning nearly 1,500 January 6 Rioters and former Illinois government Rod Blagojevich. Critics argue that the pardon power can be used for political expediency or to shield allies from accountability, potentially undermining the justice system's integrity. However, proponents see it as a means of compassion and correction, with many people seeking pardons for past convictions. Kay Rogers, a single mother of 6 who served two years in federal prison for a bank loan that never materialized, is one such individual, saying 'I've paid my debt to society long ago, I just want to move on with my life.' The pardon office is always busy, and Trump is considering appointing Alice Johnson, who was pardoned in 2020, as the Pardon Czar. The presidential pardon remains a complex instrument within the U.S. legal system, reflecting the delicate balance between justice and mercy, authority and accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 07:27 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2025/02/19/pardons-and-commutations-are-suddenly-vogue/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts forecast with a very high degree of confidence that Donald Trump will grant executive clemency to more than two individuals in June 2025. Their reasoning is grounded in several recurring points: Trump has recently granted clemency at unusually high volume\u2014including more than two dozen in a single day in late May 2025\u2014with a consistent pattern of widely publicized, politically motivated, and batch-style clemencies. Experts highlight that structural restraints have been weakened due to the replacement of career DOJ officials with loyalists, reducing traditional checks on the process. Political incentives\u2014including rewarding loyalty, signaling to Trump's base, and correcting perceived injustices\u2014strongly motivate continued mass clemency actions. Base rates and historical precedents from both Trump\u2019s first and second terms, compared to all prior presidents, point to an exceptionally high pace of pardons and commutations, with no evidence of an imminent slowdown. The only scenarios in which the threshold would not be met require highly unlikely shocks (legal, political, or personal) causing a complete and abrupt halt to clemency actions or their public disclosure. Most assess these as extremely low probability. Forecast probabilities from the group range from 90% to 98%, with most clustering at 97-98% and only cautious deference to uncertainty. In sum: barring dramatic, unforeseen developments, the expert consensus is that Trump will far exceed the >2 clemency threshold in June 2025."
