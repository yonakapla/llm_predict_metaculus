The jump in late May did not materially improve sentiment, which rebounded only from 50.8 to 52.2. All major underlying drivers (tariff impact, higher input costs, contracting services sector, inflation expectations) remain squarely negative or at best ambiguous, and the feedback between deteriorating finances and future expectations can perpetuate malaise at the margin. While it is always possible for a technical bounce or reversal to occur on a data blip (e.g., a strongly positive June jobs report or Fed surprise), I see no robust leading indicators supporting a sharp rebound exceeding the 54 threshold. Recent historical precedent argues for continued negativity in the absence of a clear positive catalyst. I judge that the probability of a <54.0 outcome on the June 2025 final print is notably above 70%, with only a modest chance of a significant upside surprise, and thus boldly assign an 80% likelihood.",

While late May showed stabilization and a modest uptick, it was insufficient to change the overall narrative of deep consumer pessimism. There is little evidence in business or consumer news of the kind of rapid, large-scale positive shift required for a reversal of this size.

My own caution against overstating one-way bets is acknowledged, but the lack of an imminent, credible positive policy/economic shock, coupled with the persistent headwinds (tariffs, inflation expectations, consumer stress), bolsters the case for a very high likelihood of a <54 outcome. The only moderating factor is the recognition of some month-to-month noise and event risk, but these are unlikely to move the reading by the full distance needed.

Several forecasters, especially those with time series and macroeconomic expertise, effectively stressed that, even with entrenched negative sentiment, historical noise around inflection points and event risk (Fed, payrolls, last-minute policy moves) mean that the tail risk for a near-term rebound is small but non-negligible. My own critique of overconfidence, plus the market research and time series forecasters\u2019 base-rate anchoring (favoring high but not extreme probabilities), persuades me to recalibrate downward, if modestly.

Critiques of the highest probability forecasts (above 90%) were persuasive in highlighting the persistent month-to-month noise in the series: even in stable regimes, the Michigan index can jump 2+ points on news shocks or data surprises. My own initial forecast may have weighted policy gridlock and pessimism a touch too heavily, underappreciating the tail risk of a policy or jobs-driven bounce.

Nearly all forecasters converge around the high 80s, with behavioral/consumer sentiment experts even higher (91-92%), and most critiques of extreme probabilities ultimately circle back to the lack of plausible positive shock scenarios within the next three weeks. The only substantive counterarguments are about base-rate volatility and the theoretical possibility of an unexpected upside surprise, but these are not supported by any concrete, positive macro or policy signals evident in the current coverage or data. Additionally, repeated evidence is presented throughout the discussion that month-to-month rebounds, especially above two points from current levels, are very rare in such deeply negative environments, and government/policy levers are effectively constrained. Effectively, my initial rationale\u2014anchored in persistent pessimism, policy drag, and lack of upside catalyst\u2014has only been reinforced. However, given the consistent theme of other experts arguing some nonzero chance of late-breaking positive news or data volatility, and my own engagement with arguments on not being excessively overconfident (e.g., not going above 90%), I will slightly adjust my probability upward but not match the most extreme behavioral estimates.

Recent data and global developments have reignited concerns about the impact of tariffs on price stability. According to current data, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) have been showing a stable increase, reaching $20.669.5 billion in April 2025. However, underlying vulnerabilities, such as declining household savings and increasing debt, raise questions about the sustainability of this consumption growth. The labor market is sending mixed signals, with strong employment growth in non-agricultural sectors, but a decline in job openings and unemployment claims. The average hourly earnings continue to rise, indicating that wage pressures are still present. The Federal Reserve is being cautious, maintaining a 'wait and see' policy, and adjusting interest rates based on incoming data. However, trade policy uncertainties are putting the Fed in a difficult balancing act, as tariffs can both increase inflation (supply shock) and weaken economic activity and employment (investment and consumption delay). If tariffs affect inflation like food and energy shocks, it could make it harder to achieve price stability and increase the risk of stagflation. The June FOMC meeting (17-18 June) will be critical in determining how the Fed will address these risks and provide forward guidance. A notable point is the divergence between household inflation expectations and market and professional forecasts. Household expectations, reflected in Michigan University surveys, are increasing, while market-based and professional forecasts remain relatively stable. This divergence is a source of uncertainty for future inflation outlook.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 08:51 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/yazarlar/ersoy-toptas/tarifelerin-fiyat-istikrari-hedefi-uzerindeki-etkisi--fed-bekle-ve-gor-politikasi-4430/)\n\n**What on Earth is going on with the American consumer?**\nThe American consumer is in a state of cautiousness due to the uncertainty of a potential recession and the ongoing trade war between the US and China.

The week ahead will feature central bank rate decisions from Canada, the ECB, and India. The US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show a +130,000 increase, but the trend is 'ho-hum'. Factory and service sector PMIs will be closely watched for the consequences of trade war activity. The US has doubled steel tariffs, making its steel industry less competitive globally and embedding higher producer costs for American factories and higher prices for its customers. China's official PMIs show a contraction in the factory version, but a tiny expansion in services. Inflation pressures aren't evident in China, and Beijing has resisted Trump's request for a phone call with Xi. Other countries' PMIs show little change, but the trade war seems to be embedding stagnation. Inflation doesn't seem to be a problem, except in the US. Central banks in other countries can try a rate cut remedy, but this remedy is not available to the Americans. China is applying both monetary and fiscal policies to stabilise their situation. India reported a +7.4% expansion in Q1-2025 GDP, led by the construction sector and consumer spending. Canada also reported an expanding economy in Q1-2025, gaining +0.5% in the quarter. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey recovered its early month drop, but the level is very pessimistic.

The combination of higher prices, uncertainty, and pessimism has led to a decline in consumer sentiment, with many people struggling to pay their bills. Student loan borrowers, in particular, have been affected by the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, with delinquencies jumping to 7.74% from 1%. Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, said, 'Adding student loans back into the mix certainly looks like it was a bridge too far for a lot of people, when it comes to their ability to pay the bills down.' The impact of defaulting on federal student loans can be severe, with credit scores dropping by an average of 140 points for those with scores above 620. Additionally, defaulted borrowers may see their wages garnished by the Department of Education. The use of Buy Now, Pay Later installment plans has increased, but it can also lead to overspending and financial difficulties.

Axios noted that the Morning Consult report confirms that the US government's excessive use of tariffs has damaged its reputation globally.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 12:12 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/domestic/945/20250603/48413604.html)\n\n**Breakfast briefing: More stagnation everywhere, more inflation in the US**\nThe US is experiencing stagflation, with the USD falling to a three-year low, gold rising, and US benchmark interest rates increasing. The week ahead will feature central bank rate decisions from Canada, the ECB, and India. The US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show a +130,000 increase, but the trend is 'ho-hum'. Factory and service sector PMIs will be closely watched for the consequences of trade war activity. The US has doubled steel tariffs, making its steel industry less competitive globally and embedding higher producer costs for American factories and higher prices for its customers. China's official PMIs show a contraction in the factory version, but a tiny expansion in services. Inflation pressures aren't evident in China, and Beijing has resisted Trump's request for a phone call with Xi. Other countries' PMIs show little change, but the trade war seems to be embedding stagnation. Inflation doesn't seem to be a problem, except in the US. Central banks in other countries can try a rate cut remedy, but this remedy is not available to the Americans. China is applying both monetary and fiscal policies to stabilise their situation. India reported a +7.4% expansion in Q1-2025 GDP, led by the construction sector and consumer spending. Canada also reported an expanding economy in Q1-2025, gaining +0.5% in the quarter. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey recovered its early month drop, but the level is very pessimistic. Job ad growth in Australia has turned into a decline, and the regulator ASIC found widespread compliance deficiencies in managed funds plans.

The report indicates that the final May consumer sentiment index was 52.2, higher than the initial value of 50.8, but the same as April, and at a historical low. According to the report, consumers' expectations for long-term inflation have also become more optimistic, with a 5-10 year average annual inflation rate (long-term inflation expectation) of 4.2%, lower than April's 4.4%, marking the first decline of the year. However, consumers still expect prices to rise 6.6% in the next year, slightly higher than April's 6.5%, but lower than the initial value of 7.3%. The survey was conducted on May 26, several weeks after the US and China agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on May 12. Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey, said, 'The data shows that consumer sentiment index declined in early May, but rebounded in late May after the US temporarily canceled tariffs on some Chinese goods.' Hsu added, 'Consumers believe the economic outlook is not worse than last month, but they are still very concerned about the future.' The survey found that consumers are pessimistic about their future income and still worry about unemployment. The personal financial situation confidence index fell to its lowest point since 2009. The University of Michigan's May consumer expectation index was 47.9, higher than April's 47.3, marking the first increase since November last year. Hsu also stated, 'Given that consumers generally believe that tariffs will be passed on to consumer prices, it is not surprising that trade policies affect their views on the economy. In contrast, although many media outlets have reported on the tax and spending bill being pushed by Congress, this bill does not seem to be prominent or attention-grabbing for consumers.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 04:36 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/5/31/n14521480.htm)\n\n**US Consumer Sentiment Index Falls to Historical Low Amid Trade War Uncertainty**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) for May 2025 fell to a historical low of 50.8, down from 52.2 in April, a decline of nearly 30% since January. This is the lowest level since June 2022, when the index was 50.0. The survey was conducted before the US-China trade war ceasefire and the final value will be released on May 30. Consumers' expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. According to Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center, nearly three-quarters of consumers spontaneously mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty affecting their views on the economy. Walmart, a US retail giant, has announced that it will raise prices due to the tariffs, citing that the current tariffs are too high for suppliers to bear. The company's CFO, John David Rainey, stated that the tariffs are putting upward pressure on the costs of imported products such as toys, electronics, coffee, and bananas.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 18, 2025 11:50 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=f6314deb-953b-4e4b-9922-67827e2f9f6f)\n\n**Americans' optimism about the economy is at a near-record low**\nAmericans' optimism about the economy has reached a near-record low, with the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index falling 2.7% to 50.8 in May. This is the second-lowest reading on record, just above the all-time low of 50 in June 2022. The index has dropped almost 30% since January, with consumers citing uncertainty and instability caused by President Trump's tariffs as a major concern. Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers, said, 'It's very clear that consumers are bracing for the uncertainty and instability of tariff policy.' Consumers expect tariffs to be painful, with year-ahead inflation expectations jumping to 7.3% from 6.5%. The current economic conditions index also dropped to 57.6, the lowest reading since December 2022. 'Consumers are understandably feeling a bit worse about where the economy is headed,' said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet. Economists had expected sentiment to improve in May, but the survey period ended before the recent d\u00e9tente and de-escalation in tariffs between the US and China. 'But these initial upticks were too small to alter the overall picture -- consumers continue to express somber views about the economy,' said Hsu.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 16, 2025 05:07 PM\nSource:[Aol](https://www.aol.com/americans-optimism-economy-near-record-143842493.html)\n\n**University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index: A Key Indicator for the Federal Reserve**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, a key indicator for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, is set to be released at 4pm ET. The survey measures consumer confidence and inflation expectations. While the data is expected to show a slight decline, from 50.8 in April to 50.6, according to Bloomberg consensus, the impact on markets may be tempered due to the release of final data rather than preliminary data. Consumer expectations for inflation over the next year may rise to 6.8%, up from 6.7% initially announced. The survey's component on inflation expectations over 5-10 years is expected to remain at 4.4%, a 0.3 percentage point increase from March and the highest level since June 1991. Safran, a CAC 40 company, is set to release its first-quarter sales figures, while Lagard\u00e8re, Spie, and S\u00e9ch\u00e9 Environnement will also release their sales data. The survey's results are expected to be influenced by the temporary reduction in tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, which may have a positive impact on consumer morale.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: April 24, 2025 01:55 PM\nSource:[Les Echos](https://investir.lesechos.fr/marches-indices/les-points-bourse/lenquete-du-michigan-barometre-de-la-confiance-des-consommateurs-americains-face-aux-droits-de-douane-2161713)\n\n**Americans' Expectations Plunge To 45 Year Lows As Democrats Send UMich Inflation Expectations Soaring**\nThe University of Michigan's (UMich) survey of consumer sentiment has shown a significant decline, with year-ahead inflation expectations surging to 6.7%, the highest reading since 1981. Democrats' expectations for a 7.9% surge in prices this year are particularly high. Consumer sentiment fell 11% from March, with the preliminary April sentiment index sliding to 50.8, the weakest reading since June 2022. Economists had predicted a decline to 53.8. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead has increased for the fifth consecutive month, with about two-thirds of consumers mentioning tariffs during interviews. According to Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, 'Alarmingly, though, consumers are now worried that they will be personally affected' by layoffs or income losses. The data suggests that consumers may not feel much relief from the April 9 social media post reversing some tariff increases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 11, 2025 02:09 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/americans-expectations-plunge-45-year-lows-democrats-drive-umich-inflation)\n\n**US Consumer Sentiment Hits 2-Year Low Amid Economic Uncertainty**\nAccording to a recent survey by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment in the US has worsened more than expected, despite the Trump administration's haphazard tariff policy. The university's Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) fell to 57.0 in March, a 0.9-point drop from the preliminary estimate released on March 14. This is the lowest level since November 2022, a decline of 11.9% compared to February. The CSI measures consumer confidence in the US economy, with a score above 100 indicating that consumers expect to spend more in the future, and a score below 100 indicating that consumers expect to cut back on spending. The University of Michigan's survey of 500 Americans across the country found that consumers are worried about potential economic pain ahead, with the CSI score of 57.0 indicating that they are more concerned about the future economy than expected. 'Consumers are worried about potential economic pain ahead,' said the University of Michigan. The survey also found that consumers expect inflation to rise to 5.0% over the next year, a 0.7% point increase from February, which is similar to the inflation rate in November 2022.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 29, 2025 06:25 AM\nSource:[\ub178\ucef7\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/6316166)\n\n**UM consumer sentiment index falls to lowest level in over 2 years in March**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 57.0 in March 2025, a 32-month low, down from 64.7 in February and 79.4 in March 2024.

According to the survey, consumers are hesitant to make long-term plans due to the frequent changes in economic policies. Joanna Su, the director of the survey, stated, 'Many consumers cited high uncertainty about policy and other economic factors as the reason for their pessimism.' She added, 'All three types of politically affiliated consumers agree that economic expectations have weakened since February.'

    "summary": "All forecasting experts overwhelmingly expect the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number to be less than 54.0, with probability estimates ranging from 80% to 92%. Their forecasts are grounded in the recent trajectory of the index, which sits at 52.2 for May, remaining below the threshold and at multi-year lows. The forecasters cite persistent macroeconomic headwinds\u2014tariffs, inflation, policy uncertainty, rising debt stress, and labor market fragility\u2014as strong, ongoing depressants to consumer sentiment. While some point to minor, positive developments (e.g., temporary tariff rollbacks in late May) that created a small uptick from early May lows, all agree these effects are insufficiently strong or broad-based to prompt a sharp rebound above 54.0. Behavioral economics experts emphasize loss aversion, recency bias, and the anchoring effect of deeply negative news, suggesting consumer pessimism is likely to persist. Political scientists and macroeconomists add that there is little evidence for imminent positive policy shocks or election-year stimulus robust enough to drive a rapid sentiment turnaround. Across all perspectives\u2014economic, behavioral, and political\u2014the consensus is that unless a large, unexpected, and well-communicated positive shock occurs (which all see as unlikely in the next three weeks), the final June number will remain sub-54.0. The overall probability-weighted outlook is thus highly confident in a 'Yes' resolution to the question."
