The base rate for heads of state from smaller non-member countries confirming BRICS attendance is modest, especially given Mexican and Colombian caution. However, Brazil's presidency, the focus on Mercosur and multilateralism, and Orsi\u2019s personal advocacy for regional cooperation may tip the balance. Delaying the announcement could be strategic to avoid pre-judging signals to larger powers, with a decision emerging after Orsi\u2019s UN participation. Overall, while indeterminacy and scheduling challenges temper the odds, Uruguay leans toward a public commitment\u2014especially if other regional leaders lean in as well.

Additionally, there is precedent from other Latin American invitees (notably Mexico) for sending lower-level officials or only sending verbal support, not a direct head-of-state announcement. The diplomatic cost of not attending is softened further if Colombia and Mexico do not announce presidential attendance. While Orsi appears interested in engagement, protocol and logistical considerations in the final weeks make an explicit, public, government announcement before July 1 that he himself will attend quite uncertain.

The lack of an official announcement after months of open invitation, especially with Mexico\u2019s similar hesitancy, signals either internal debate or downgrading the priority of the BRICS summit relative to UN/Western fora. Further, base rates for lower-middle power leaders accepting general summit invitations (without direct membership or concrete stakes) are mixed, with announcements more likely if it is a regional priority, but often delivered late, if at all. On balance: Uruguay\u2019s desire for multilateral visibility, diplomatic courtship by Brazil, and liberal policy orientation raise the odds above pure inertia\u2014but the competing UN commitment and the absence of a firm signal so close to the deadline curb the probability.

Uruguay may instead announce a lower-level representative to attend.",

Orsi\u2019s foreign policy posture, public support for multilateralism and free trade, and ideological affinity with Brazil's Lula further make an affirmative announcement likely. Overlapping obligations are a logistical hurdle but not a disqualifying one, as the diplomatic value lies in the announcement rather than actual attendance or deep engagement. No evidence has emerged of any strong reason for Uruguay to rebuff Brazil\u2019s invitation. Given the time constraint (roughly three weeks), the incentives, historical regional patterns, and Orsi's own rhetoric, I judge the probability that Uruguay will officially announce Orsi\u2019s attendance before July 1 at 85%. Uncertainty remains around scheduling and unforeseen domestic/external disruptions, but the balance of probabilities strongly favors 'Yes.'",

The conference aims to 'promote concrete solutions to finance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda' and is expected to result in a document of commitments 'to mobilize public and private resources, as well as new forms of cooperation and investment in sustainable development.'

Lula said, 'We will certainly discuss the war in Ukraine, the massacre perpetrated by the Israeli army in Gaza, the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, and defense issues.' The visit follows Macron's trip to Brazil in March 2024, where they visited the Amazon and a French naval base that is building submarines for Brazil. However, since then, Donald Trump has returned to power in the US, and 'in the current context,' it is 'very important to find convergences with Brazil, a major emerging state,' with a 'weighty voice in Latin America and the rest of the world,' the French presidency emphasized. Lula is currently the pro tempore president of the BRICS group of emerging countries, which will hold its summit in Rio de Janeiro in July, and France hopes that Brazil will use its diplomatic weight in the cases of Ukraine and Gaza. France is counting on Brazil to influence the outcome of the conference it is organizing with Saudi Arabia at the UN in mid-June, which aims to promote a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Lula stated, 'There will be no peace as long as there is no awareness that the Palestinian people have the right to their own state.' On Ukraine, France plans to present Lula with a summary of the situation, with 'one part that is willing to make peace and another part, the aggressor, that rejects any proposal for peace or dialogue.' Brazil maintains good relations with Russia, and Lula was in Moscow on May 9 to commemorate the victory over Nazi Germany, where he was received by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The visit will include a military welcome ceremony, a working lunch at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, and a state dinner in the same space. The agenda also includes the signing of bilateral agreements, participation in an economic forum, and tributes to Lula at the French Academy and the University of Paris 8.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 05:53 PM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/es/minuto-a-minuto/20250603-macron-recibe-a-lula-en-francia-en-un-agitado-contexto-internacional)\n\n**Uruguay's President to Attend UN Conference on Sustainable Development Financing**\nUruguay's President Yamand\u00fa Orsi will participate in the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Sustainable Development in Seville, Spain, from June 30 to July 3, according to an announcement.

'There is a new international context that pushes in favor of the ratification of the free trade agreement,' said the Brazilian diplomacy. Despite the disagreement on this issue, France wants to maintain its relationship with Brazil, which is the largest market for French investments in emerging countries. Lula will meet with French business leaders and sign several agreements. He will also visit the Toulon shipyard to see the construction of nuclear-powered submarines, as part of a technology transfer agreement between the two countries. This visit is also an opportunity to strengthen ties with the 'Global South' and the BRICS group, which Lula chairs.

The meeting focused on the protection of rights and inclusion of women in the digital economy, the role of women in addressing the climate emergency, and women's participation in the BRICS agenda. Deputada Jack Rocha emphasized the need for more women in parliament, citing that despite being responsible for over 40% of the production of legislation in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, women make up only 18.1% of the chamber. She advocated for the establishment of quotas to overcome the representation imbalance. Deputada C\u00e9lia Xakriab\u00e1 proposed the allocation of 5% of the military budgets of BRICS countries to actions focused on climate justice and gender. The proposal was sent to President Lula and the president of the New Development Bank, Dilma Rousseff. Roza Chemeris, a representative of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, highlighted the importance of expanding women's participation in decision-making spaces on climate issues.

Lula explained that the income from oil exploitation is crucial for financing Brazil's energy transition, stating, 'Brasil no va a renunciar a una riqueza importante para su desarrollo.' Macron has expressed interest in achieving concrete results in reducing emissions at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. The EU-Mercosur trade agreement remains a point of contention between Brazil and France, with French farmers fearing competition from South American products. The Brazilian government believes that the current tensions in European-US trade could facilitate progress in the agreement, particularly if strategic alliances with emerging countries like Brazil are revalued.

    "summary": "Forecasters are divided over whether Uruguay will announce President Yamand\u00fa Orsi's attendance at the July 2025 BRICS summit before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The key points of consensus are as follows: \n\nA public, explicit invitation from Brazil (Lula) and Orsi\u2019s multilateral rhetoric increase the plausibility of such an announcement, especially given regional diplomatic momentum. Uruguay under Orsi is open to multilateral engagement, and making high-profile appearances would signal both international visibility and balanced foreign policy. \n\nHowever, a significant logistical and scheduling constraint exists, as Orsi is scheduled for a UN conference in Seville, Spain, from June 30 to July 3, just days before the BRICS summit in Brazil (July 6-7). Forecasters note this compressed timeline makes a public confirmation of Orsi's personal attendance more challenging, as protocol offices and government communication practices often avoid overlapping announcements and tightly packed summit travel. \n\nSeveral experts point out that similar invitations to other Latin American heads of state (notably Mexico and Colombia) have been received cautiously, with Mexico's president signaling a likely lower-level representative instead. This could set a precedent for Uruguay to do the same. Additionally, Uruguay\u2019s historic caution in not antagonizing Western powers, especially as BRICS pursues alternative global governance paths, represents a downward pressure on the probability.\n\nBase rates are mixed: while Uruguay often accepts invitations from major neighbors and participates in multilateral forums, actual pre-event confirmation of presidential attendance as non-members at BRICS is infrequent, and ambiguous or last-minute announcements are common. \n\nProbabilities offered by the experts range widely: two assessments (Dependency Theory and Rational Choice Institutionalism) give a high probability (85%), suggesting structural incentives and low risk push Uruguay toward a public announcement. Several center-left to moderate forecasts cluster between 62% and 68%, citing likelihood but hedging for scheduling or diplomatic ambiguity. Others adopt a more skeptical stance, with probabilities between 22% and 42%, highlighting the lack of an official announcement so far, competing commitments, and Uruguay\u2019s customary caution. The lowest probabilities (22-35%) come from those emphasizing the protocol and communication lags and Uruguay\u2019s preference to avoid diplomatic overextension.\n\nIn sum: while there is notable optimism (especially among experts focusing on regional incentives and Uruguayan pragmatism), a substantial minority anticipates that Uruguay may run out the clock without making a formal announcement, citing scheduling conflicts and the lack of a prior precedent for open presidential confirmation at such summits. The forecasts reflect considerable uncertainty, but most see Uruguay's official announcement as somewhat (though not overwhelmingly) more likely than not, with an average probability in the 50-60% range, but a meaningful risk of inaction remains."
