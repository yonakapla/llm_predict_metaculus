The late date and strong field, especially Byron Donalds' Trump-backed candidacy and Casey DeSantis' potential presence, further crowd out a viable late entry.

The critiques leveled at the rational choice position (including my own) make it clear we must leave a non-zero possibility for unpredictable, irrational, or symbolic late entries, but even those are not sufficient to justify a higher probability given the hard institutional, procedural, and political constraints detailed in the discussion. The filibuster against higher odds from all sides\u2014including expertise in campaign timetabling, statewide procedures, and party systems\u2014affirms the overwhelming structural headwinds. I see only one forecaster giving a higher probability (7-8%), and even those forecasts stress the scenario is extremely unlikely. There is no new positive signal, and if anything, the group strengthens confidence in a very strong 'No' outcome. After careful review, I will not change my initial 5% probability.",

The handful of dissenting voices arguing for higher probabilities hinge on psychological factors or dramatic exceptions that are outliers, not trends\u2014especially in the Florida context, where movement from high-profile, sitting mayors to statewide races without substantial preparation is almost unheard of. Furthermore, group consensus among experts in campaign timing, viability, and state-specific practices converges tightly around very low single-digits. The critique of mid-single-digit or higher forecasts as being overly influenced by a sense of Florida's volatility, rather than the hard boundaries of actual campaign machinery, is persuasive. Nothing in deliberation has raised new facts or scenario likelihoods warranting even a slight increase. My forecast remains unchanged.",

The only plausible scenario for a late entrance remains an unforeseen and extraordinary exogenous shock, for which there is no current evidence. The operational, institutional, and rational incentive structures remain dominant. Thus, there is no justification for a material upward or downward revision.

While arguments that political actors sometimes act outside rational-choice boundaries have some merit, in this highly constrained, high-risk context, nearly all signals\u2014including lack of campaign activity, imminent Miami decision, and consolidated competition\u2014reinforce that only an extraordinary outlier event would prompt an announcement.

While there is always some residual tail risk in politics, the structural, logistical, and rational constraints in this specific context are overwhelming, and the reporting shows Suarez is more likely to wait than rush.

Suarez would get a ninth consecutive year as mayor, while Carollo would get nine consecutive years as the District 3 commissioner.

Although he did not mention Hochul by name, he told The New York Times that 'people are suffering, and New York deserves better leadership.' Hochul appointed Delgado as lieutenant governor in May 2022, replacing Benjamin who resigned due to allegations of campaign finance fraud. However, Delgado announced in February that he would not continue as Hochul's running mate, sparking speculation about his potential candidacy.

Pizzo stated, 'Yes, I am' running for governor, citing his ability to balance a checkbook and understand finance as key qualifications. He criticized the Democratic and Republican parties for not addressing the needs of most Floridians, saying they are more concerned with 'rhetoric' and 'overreacting' to each other's statements. Pizzo has faced criticism from Democrats, with Florida Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried calling his decision to switch parties an 'embarrassing temper tantrum.' Pizzo has rejected the idea that he will be a spoiler in the 2026 election, saying that NPA voters decide who wins elections in Florida and that he has a strong following among them.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 09, 2025 10:29 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/state-sen-jason-pizzo-tells-cbs-news-miami-yes-i-am-running-for-governor/)\n\n**New poll of GOP gov race shows the power of Trump endorsement in Donalds-Casey DeSantis matchup \u2022 Florida Phoenix**\nA recent poll by The James Madison Institute shows U.S. Rep.

'After much prayer and reflection with my family and friends, I am here to announce my candidacy to be the next governor of the great state of Florida,' said Donalds, a Naples Republican, to Fox News host Sean Hannity. Donalds, who served four years in the Florida Legislature before being elected to Congress in 2020, is running with the support of President Donald Trump, who announced last week that he would back Donalds if he ran against DeSantis. Trump's endorsement has been a decisive factor in Florida campaigns, including DeSantis's 2018 gubernatorial win. However, DeSantis is expected to leave office in 2027 due to term limits, and his wife, First Lady Casey DeSantis, has been considering a run to succeed him. DeSantis has been discussing his chances of winning, while also criticizing Donald Trump's record. Donald Trump said on Tuesday night that DeSantis is a 'great governor.'

Byron Donalds, a congressman from southwest Florida, is a leading candidate, but his views on Jim Crow-era America have been criticized. Donalds has expressed nostalgia for the past, saying 'the Black family was together' and Black people voted conservative, but this is 'nonsense' as Black people were largely disenfranchised back then. Casey DeSantis, the wife of current Governor Ron DeSantis, is also a strong contender, with a recent poll showing her leading the pack. However, she has been accused of being 'paranoid' and 'ruthless' in her campaign tactics. Other candidates include Matt Gaetz, who has been credibly accused of 'prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress'; Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson; and Jeannette Nu\u00f1ez, who is currently the president of FAU.

    "summary": "All experts agree that it is highly unlikely Francis Suarez will announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025. Their forecasts, which range between 3% and 8% probability for a 'Yes' outcome, converge for several key reasons. First, the Miami City Commission is considering a proposal to extend Suarez's mayoral term, providing a strong incentive for him to remain in office and avoid a rushed statewide campaign announcement. Second, the Republican primary field is already crowded and led by Byron Donalds, who holds Trump's endorsement, and potentially Casey DeSantis, both of whom have considerably greater name recognition, institutional backing, and polling strength, leaving Suarez with a narrow and less viable lane. Third, major candidates in Florida typically announce earlier to build coalitions, secure donors, and mount viable statewide operations; there is no evidence Suarez has taken these preparatory steps, and historical base rates show late entries are rare for serious contenders without a major catalyst. Fourth, Suarez's own public statements have been noncommittal, which experts view more as political positioning than genuine pre-announcement activity. Unless there is an unforeseen political shock (e.g., a collapse of a frontrunner or failure of the Miami election extension), the incentive and opportunity structure almost universally discourages an imminent announcement. In summary, the prevailing political environment, campaign norms, Suarez's polling and momentum, and city-level institutional changes all make a candidacy announcement before July 1 extremely unlikely."
