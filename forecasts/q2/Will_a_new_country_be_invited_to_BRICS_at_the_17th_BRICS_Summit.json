Expansion decisions involve complex behind-the-scenes bargaining, risk-aversion by host nations, a desire to maintain cohesion among a now heterogenous group, and institutional inertia that shapes the probability of a new invitation. An understanding of how summit agendas, leader-level negotiations, and consensus rules impact final communiqu\u00e9s is essential to distinguish speculative interest from real movement.",

The base rate for annual expansion is low: after major additions in 2023 and 2025 (Indonesia), previous expansions have not been annual or opportunistic but carefully pre-negotiated. Key institutional actors\u2014most notably Brazil as host\u2014are on public record as wanting to consolidate, not grow further, citing consensus difficulties and rule-making lag. 'Institutional problems' and lack of joint communiqu\u00e9s further underline the bloc's stretched ability to integrate more new members. None of the most recently discussed potential candidates (Kazakhstan, Turkey, Malaysia, Vietnam, Senegal) have formal status upgrades under discussion; Kazakhstan has just publicly ruled out accession, and there is no evidence of a surprise consensus being assembled versus clear statements to the contrary. While a surprise invitation is not impossible (especially given summit choreography and headline incentives), it would require a last-minute diplomatic shift that has no public signs in the current enviroment. Thus, the probability is quite low, but given the nonzero probability of a strategic play or gesture and the visibility of partners vying for status, it cannot be set at absolute zero.",

However, this expansion has resulted in well-documented institutional and political strain, prompting a freeze on new full-member invitations. All recent statements by Brazilian officials\u2014who hold summit presidency\u2014favor 'consolidating' rather than expanding, and consensus (required for invitations) is at its lowest ebb; even ministerial declarations fail to achieve unanimity. The partner/observer country tier clearly exists to absorb external interest and avoid new full-member expansion, with key high-profile candidates (Kazakhstan, Turkey, Malaysia, Nigeria) stuck in that category and showing little prospect of rapid promotion. Russia and China have pulled back, at least temporarily, from maximalist expansion rhetoric, partly due to Trump\u2019s tariff threats and partly due to intra-BRICS frictions. There remains a very slim chance that a strategic, 'exceptional' expansion is greenlit at the summit, but this would likely require a rapid, high-level diplomatic shift not currently signaled in the news. Overall, the procedural, political, and institutional headwinds outweigh the momentum of the previous cycle. Thus, while an extreme Yes scenario cannot be totally excluded, it is very unlikely.",

Most high-interest applicants are not immediate priorities; Kazakhstan has explicitly opted out and others lack momentum or face Brazilian skepticism.

The already low base rate is thus reinforced, and I find no compelling rationale to raise my probability. In fact, considering the weight of group consensus and further scrutiny of possible procedural loopholes, I am inclined to nudge my probability even lower to reflect near-consensus and the diplomatic realities prohibiting further expansion at this summit.",

Notably, the critique of the PoliticalScienceRationalChoiceInstitutionalism forecast underscores that the procedural steps necessary for an 'exception' are simply not visible: the expansion process is highly formal, news coverage and official statements show no concrete moves toward elevation of a partner, and all signals from Brazil and bloc leadership suggest a strong aversion to summit surprises. The neorealist argument further highlighted that BRICS\u2019 major powers are not maneuvering for a geopolitical expansion play at this summit. Since all new input confirmed pervasive institutional fatigue, consensus fragility, and procedural inertia, the best-supported base rate may be even slightly lower than my original estimate. However, since the difference is marginal and both diplomatic precedent and group mood still allow for the slimmest sliver of a shock outcome, I hold my estimate steady but could justify nudging it toward 6% for even greater extremity.

The critiques from both the procedures/process forecaster and the liberal institutionalist highlight, with solid evidence, that all plausible signals and mechanisms point to institutional consolidation and a reluctance to risk further enlargement. The lack of any surfaced backchannel lobbying, leaks, or diplomatic choreography supporting a last-minute addition, plus Brazil's public aversion to even 'exceptional' new members, point to a near-lock for a 'No' outcome. The pushback I received underlines that my initial 10% left too much room for a neorealist 'power play' surprise\u2014in reality, not only are such mechanisms not visible, but institutional brakes are actively being applied and the 'partner' status is serving its purpose. That said, international politics always leaves the door slightly ajar for unexpected, symbolic moves, so dropping all the way to 5% would underweight genuine uncertainty.

Critiques reinforced the near-absolute nature of the unanimity requirement, and no compelling exception scenario or diplomatic breakthrough is currently evidenced. If anything, the group discussion suggested my initial 10% estimate may even be a shade high, as several experts posted sub-10% probabilities. However, given the precedent of surprises in international negotiations and in line with a liberal institutionalist respect for residual uncertainty, I will hold the line at 10%\u2014not going lower, but certainly not raising it.

The debates clarified that the theoretical possibility of a 'symbolic exception' or a sudden high-profile consensus is further out of reach than my initial forecast reflected. There is even less sign of a plausible pathway or momentum for a new invitation in the current environment of consolidation, institutional strain, and preference for the new partner category as a pressure-release valve. Summiteers are telegraphing a desire to avoid surprises amid gridlock and no country has emerged as a consensus favorite.

Engaging with others highlighted how institutional and procedural obstacles are even steeper than my own initial assessment conveyed\u2014unanimity is functioning as a nearly insurmountable brake, and the new partner mechanism exists explicitly to deflect demands for immediate full membership. The rational choice and international organizations analysts argue convincingly that, in the absence of diplomatic leaks or signaling of a surprise breakthrough, the real risk is practically negligible this cycle. No credible plausible path for a last-minute deviation has emerged in recent weeks. Thus, any remaining probability margin mostly captures the very tail risk of a black swan or sudden geopolitical deal, but the base rate and the landscape of elite preferences make a further cut toward the bottom end justified.",

Critiques of higher probabilities convincingly show that even 'exception' scenarios lack the procedural momentum or diplomatic groundwork visible in advance of previous expansions. No credible back-channel or process-based evidence exists that would justify raising the risk above a very slim tail.

South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6\u20137, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.",

Prior to the summit, the 11th BRICS Parliamentary Forum will take place in Bras\u00edlia from June 3-5, featuring representatives from the bloc's parliaments.

This decision, based on 'pragmatic' considerations, highlights the growing reluctance of Astana to engage in projects that do not align with its national interests. While Russia is actively promoting BRICS as an alternative to Western influence, Kazakhstan prefers to maintain its status as a partner. BRICS was initially positioned as an economic bloc of fast-growing nations, but Moscow aims to transform it into a kind of 'anti-Western' club, capable of creating a 'multipolar world' and countering the influence of the US and Europe. The Kremlin sees the expansion of BRICS (which has already included Iran, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ethiopia) as a tool to weaken Western sanctions and form a new geopolitical axis. For Russia, BRICS is not only an economic platform but also an important political tool to demonstrate its 'alternative' agenda to the world. However, Kazakhstan's decision not to join the alliance, despite receiving invitations, clearly indicates a strategic divergence in views. Relations between Moscow and Astana have deteriorated significantly in recent years, driven by a range of factors. Kazakhstan, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to foreign policy, seeks to diversify its connections, actively developing cooperation with China, Central Asian countries, and Western states. The refusal of Tokayev to visit Moscow for the Victory Day parade in 2025 is a notable example of this. Tokayev's decision to prioritize the UN as a 'universal and non-alternative organization' for discussing all relevant international issues, rather than fully engaging in opaque structures like BRICS, clearly demonstrates his priorities: sovereignty, stability, and predictability, rather than participation in questionable geopolitical adventures. The rejection of full membership in BRICS is not just a diplomatic note, but a confirmation of Kazakhstan's course on distancing itself from the orbit of influence of the Kremlin.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 07:03 PM\nSource:[dialog.ua](https://www.dialog.ua/world/314607_1748620037)\n\n**Kazakhstan Declines to Join BRICS, Citing 'Institutional Problems'**\nKazakhstan has decided not to join the BRICS organization, according to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. He stated that he is guided by 'pragmatic' considerations and considers the status of a partner to be sufficient. Tokayev noted that the question is about the usefulness of full membership and pointed out that BRICS 'has no charter, no secretariat, and no programs'. 'Let's see how effective BRICS will be as an international organization. For now, Kazakhstan will remain an observer, and we'll see what the future holds,' he concluded. Kazakhstan has been a partner of BRICS since January 1, 2025. The organization was established in 2006 and currently consists of Russia, Brazil, India, China, South Africa, the UAE, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Indonesia. BRICS has put its expansion on hold since February, citing 'institutional problems' arising from the increase in the number of participants. This decision comes amid threats by US President Donald Trump to impose 100% tariffs on countries in the organization for attempting to create a new currency and move away from the dollar. After this, Russia, which actively promoted the idea since the start of the invasion of Ukraine, distanced itself from the project.

Tokayev noted that BRICS is a 'promoted international structure', but emphasized that Kazakhstan will continue to participate as an observer for now, with the possibility of further involvement to be reviewed in the future, according to Interfax. When asked about the timeline for submitting a membership application, Tokayev replied that there are no such plans at present. 'We have secured the status of observer in BRICS, and I believe this is quite sufficient,' he added. Tokayev also pointed out the lack of a clear structure within the organization, including a charter, secretariat, and programs. He noted that Kazakhstan's status as a BRICS partner state will come into effect on January 1, 2025.

Stanislav Shpakovskiy, a representative from Rosatom, stated, 'Generally, the sector is expecting an increase in interest in financing nuclear projects, including small-scale nuclear power plants, as a result of the growing priority given to financing 'energy transition' projects, including nuclear energy.

Ahmed Al Sayegh, State Minister, stated that the UAE believes this summit is an opportunity to strengthen its position as a global trade and investment hub. He emphasized that the UAE's foreign trade policy focuses on integrating with Asian markets. Al Sayegh added, 'The UAE confirms that cooperation provides wide opportunities to increase the flow of goods and services, support vital infrastructure projects, exchange knowledge, accelerate innovation, and enjoy beneficial relations in trade and investment with Asian countries, including ASEAN member states. The UAE also has strong trade and investment relations with China, with China maintaining its position as the UAE's largest trading partner with a value of $86.6 billion in 2023.' He continued, 'Considering that the non-oil trade between the UAE and ASEAN countries reached $36.21 billion in 2023, this summit will open new horizons for trade and investment exchange. Therefore, the UAE is committed to enhancing cooperation through the joint work framework between the GCC and ASEAN for the period 2024-2028, reflecting our integrated vision for building long-term strategic partnerships. The UAE has signed comprehensive economic partnership agreements with several ASEAN member states, including Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia, in a step that confirms the country's commitment to expanding its economic network with South East Asian countries.' Al Sayegh highlighted that the GDP of ASEAN countries reached approximately $3.8 trillion in 2023, accounting for about 3.6% of the world's economy, and approximately 20% of the European Union's economy, and about 1.8 times the size of the GCC's economy. This underscores the importance of cooperation and supporting sustained growth paths, making this partnership a key driver of the global economy. Al Sayegh stated that strengthening cooperation across the Asian continent will contribute to accelerating growth, driving innovation, and establishing the region's position as a rising global economic power. He pointed out that the total exports of the GCC countries reached approximately $122 billion in 2023, accounting for 8.2% of the GCC's total exports, which confirms that cooperation between these major economic blocs represents a unique opportunity to expand partnerships and enhance stability in the region.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 04:15 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/ahmed-al-sayegh-enhancing-cooperation-across-asian)\n\n**Kazakhstan Declines to Join BRICS, Citing 'Institutional Problems'**\nKazakhstan has decided not to join the BRICS organization, according to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.

The bloc aims to promote economic development and cooperation among its member countries. In 2024, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran joined the group, and Indonesia also joined this year. The BRICS bloc has its own development bank, the New Development Bank (NDB), which has allocated resources for 31 initiatives in Brazil, including solar and wind power projects. The bloc also discusses the use of local currencies in trade and defends changes in international organizations such as the United Nations and the IMF. In the field of science and technology, they discuss the use of Artificial Intelligence, digital security, and innovation in industry. Senator Humberto Costa (PT-PE) believes that the next meeting will facilitate the definition of priorities for each country, while Senator Nelsinho Trad (PSD-MS) sees opportunities for business in the midst of the US trade war. 'A high-level debate where we will discuss the issues related to this global commercial conflict, the business opportunities that will open up for us. When you close a door, you can be sure that a window will open. It's time to take advantage of that opportunity and make the most of Brazilian trade issues.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 02:41 PM\nSource:[Portal da C\u00e2mara dos Deputados](https://www.camara.leg.br/noticias/1164620-paises-do-brics-respondem-por-quase-30-da-economia-mundial-e-por-20-do-comercio-global/)\n\n**11th BRICS Parliamentary Forum to Take Place in Brazil**\nThe 11th Parliamentary Forum of the BRICS will take place from June 3 to 5 at the National Congress in Brazil, with 15 countries confirmed to participate. The event will bring together around 150 parliamentarians to discuss cooperation and development among the BRICS member countries. The forum will focus on topics such as sustainable development, social justice, and multilateral governance. The program will include two parallel events on the first day: the Meeting of Presidents of the Foreign Relations Commissions of the BRICS Parliaments and the BRICS Women Parliamentarians Meeting. The latter will discuss the role of women in the face of technological and environmental transformations. The BRICS member countries, including Brazil, China, India, and Russia, will also participate in the event, along with partner countries such as Belarus, Bolivia, and Cuba. As stated by the BRICS, the forum aims to consolidate inter-parliamentary cooperation among member countries and reaffirm the commitment of the Legislative Powers to the strengthening of political dialogue, the exchange of good practices, and the construction of a common agenda focused on sustainable development, social justice, and multilateral governance. 'The BRICS is a forum for political-diplomatic articulation and cooperation of the so-called 'global south', said the BRICS in a statement. 'The meeting of the group will mark a significant advancement in the consolidation of inter-parliamentary cooperation among member countries, reiterating the commitment of the Legislative Powers to the strengthening of political dialogue, the exchange of good practices and the construction of a common agenda focused on sustainable development, social justice and multilateral governance.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 02:37 PM\nSource:[senado.leg.br](https://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/materias/2025/05/30/forum-parlamentar-do-brics-comeca-na-terca-com-15-paises-confirmados)\n\n**Tokayev: Kazakhstan Does Not Plan to Join BRICS in the Near Future**\nKazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev stated in an interview with Al Jazeera that the country does not currently plan to become a full member of the BRICS organization, and that its status as an observer is sufficient. Tokayev noted that BRICS is a 'promoted international structure', but emphasized that Kazakhstan will continue to participate as an observer for now, with the possibility of further involvement to be reviewed in the future, according to Interfax. When asked about the timeline for submitting a membership application, Tokayev replied that there are no such plans at present. 'We have secured the status of observer in BRICS, and I believe this is quite sufficient,' he added. Tokayev also pointed out the lack of a clear structure within the organization, including a charter, secretariat, and programs. He noted that Kazakhstan's status as a BRICS partner state will come into effect on January 1, 2025. Currently, the BRICS organization consists of ten countries: Russia, China, Brazil, South Africa, India, Egypt, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 09:27 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/tokaev-kazahstan-v-blizhajshej-perspektive-ne-planiruet-vstupat-v-briks-633586.html)\n\n**Russia- Islamic World Forum Sees Record Participation from 103 Countries**\nThe 16th edition of the international economic forum 'Russia - the Islamic World' saw a significant increase in international participation, with 103 countries attending, up from 90 last year.

The forum featured over 130 events, with a focus on digital transformation. The event saw the participation of high-level delegations from Malaysia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Nigeria, the UAE, Senegal, and Iran. The forum was a platform for cooperation and exchange in the media sector, with the signing of a cooperation agreement between 'TV BRICS' and 'Sada el-Balad' to promote Egypt's presence in the international media landscape, particularly in BRICS and BRICS+ countries.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 07:34 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6589872)\n\n**BRICS Should Consolidate Current Size, Says Celso Amorim**\nCelso Amorim, special advisor to the Brazilian Presidency, stated that the BRICS group should be consolidated with its current size, but may make an exception for new members. 'The BRICS needs to be consolidated as it is. There may be some exceptions, I don't know how it will be, but it needs to be consolidated basically with its current size', he said. 'Every time you want to create a very large group, cohesion is very difficult, so you can't take decisions. I think the BRICS is at the right size', Amorim added. The last expansions, in 2023 and 2024, were sponsored by China and Russia, against the will of Brazil. The diplomatic community believes that a large bloc loses cohesion and that Brazil's leadership could be diluted. The expansion of members has created obstacles to what had already been agreed upon and now there is an effort to adapt the institutional framework, formalize rules and even the rotation of the presidency of the bloc. The entry of more members has had a negative effect: last year's summit disagreements between African countries led to the withdrawal of three countries, including Brazil, which were supported to enter as permanent members of the UN Security Council. In 2023, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran were invited to become members. Indonesia formalized its membership this year, while Argentina declined. Saudi Arabia participates with lower-level political representatives and has not formalized its membership yet. After 2024, nine countries with a lower association status (Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, and Uzbekistan) joined the group, totaling 13 'partners' invited. There is dissatisfaction with their engagement and the space allocated to them. Initially, the 'partners' were invited only to the meeting of foreign ministers and leaders and do not have the right to veto. The group is guided by the rule of consensus. Two countries that have been insisting on joining the bloc are Turkey and Venezuela. Turkey requested membership but received an invitation to partner last year. Venezuela, on the other hand, had its access as a partner vetoed by Brazil - Lula and dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro are experiencing a moment of political estrangement. When asked by Estad\u00e3o if the government would now unblock Venezuela's access, Amorim said that 'there is no need, because there is nothing blocked'. The newspaper reported that authorities in Caracas have reiterated their interest in participating to Brazil. Amorim stated that there is no reason for an approach with Caracas, except for economic opportunities, the refugee issue, and a formal state relationship, etc. In April, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also defended the continuation of expansion 'very soon' and advocated that associated partners would have priority to become members.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 12:02 PM\nSource:[Estad\u00e3o](https://www.estadao.com.br/internacional/brics-deve-consolidar-tamanho-atual-mas-pode-haver-excecao-e-nova-adesao-indica-celso-amorim/)\n\n**Maric\u00e1 and Havana Establish Sister City Relationship**\nThe mayor of Maric\u00e1, Quaqu\u00e1, confirmed that a commitment to establish a sister city relationship between Maric\u00e1 and Havana was made during his recent visit to the island. The invitation came from Havana's governor, Yanet Hern\u00e1ndez, who received him at an official dinner at the Casa de la Amistad, the government's headquarters. During the meeting, the mayor also extended an invitation to Hern\u00e1ndez to participate in the General Assembly of Mayors and Municipalities of Brics+, which will take place in Maric\u00e1 from May 26 to 28. Quaqu\u00e1 wrote on social media, 'We signed the agreement of sisterhood between the cities and invited her to come to Brazil to participate in the Brics+ Assembly.' During the event, both officials exchanged symbolic gifts, a common practice in diplomatic initiatives of this type. The gifts included books, typical drinks, and t-shirts representing the culture of each city. Quaqu\u00e1 gave the governor a flag of the Union of Maric\u00e1 and a shirt from the local samba school, which participated in the International Tourism Fair (FitCuba) held in Havana from April 30 to May 3. According to the Brasil 247 portal, the signing of the agreement between Maric\u00e1 and Havana follows a trend of the current municipal administration to expand its international projection, especially with countries of the South Global and Brics. It refers that Rio promotes encounters and agreements with representatives of other nations of the block and now strengthens ties with Cuba. 'The agreement is symbolic, but it opens the doors to continuous dialogue. We want this relationship to go far,' Quaqu\u00e1 emphasized. He also revealed plans for future cultural exchange and to invite the Cuban governor to attend the famous Carnival of Rio in 2026. Brics+ is a group of countries that aims to promote economic, political, and social cooperation among its members. Brics refers to the founding countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, and the + refers to the expansion of the group to include new members. Two years ago, six new countries joined: Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Ethiopia. This expansion aims to strengthen South-South cooperation and promote economic and social development among member countries. There are two categories of participation in Brics: member countries and partners, and recently, Cuba, Belarus, Nigeria, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, and Uzbekistan joined the latter.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 06, 2025 01:04 PM\nSource:[prensa-latina.cu](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/05/06/ciudad-brasilena-de-marica-y-la-habana-sellan-hermandad/)\n\n**BRICS Meeting Ends Without Joint Declaration**\nThe meeting of foreign ministers of the BRICS countries ended without adopting a joint declaration, according to Brazilian Foreign Minister Vierya. He emphasized that there is a 'resolute common rejection of the revival of trade protectionism and the use of non-tariff measures under the pretext of environmental protection.' Vierya also stated that 'reforming the WTO and fully restoring the activity of its dispute settlement body is extremely necessary.' The final document of the Rio summit was signed only by the Brazilian presidency of the BRICS group, which should give more weight to the summit of leaders, scheduled to take place in July in the same city. The group has existing commitments and agreements with other ministers, and 'we decided to make a presidential statement, as often happens at many meetings, precisely to pave the way for us for very cautious negotiations and an accurate statement that will be made in July at the meeting of heads of state,' he said. The BRICS group currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Iran. The group has two categories of participants: member countries and partners. The latter became members with a lower status than full members but with the possibility of participating in leadership and thematic meetings. Recently, the following countries joined the group as partner countries: Cuba, Belarus, Nigeria, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, and Uzbekistan. The Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that the meeting in Rio de Janeiro was marked by a strong political commitment and a search for an agenda of solutions for BRICS countries and the global South, especially in the year when Brazil is hosting the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30). Vierya also analyzed various demonstrations in support of strengthening the United Nations, especially its Security Council. The group calls for more active participation of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in all multilateral systems, including the WTO, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. The declaration also contains a warning about the risks of a possible nuclear conflict. Ministers expressed concern about the growing risks of nuclear threats and nuclear conflict. 'They confirmed the need to revive the disarmament system, arms control, and non-proliferation, and to preserve its integrity and effectiveness to achieve global stability, international peace, and security,' the document emphasizes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 30, 2025 04:48 AM\nSource:[ruso.prensa-latina.cu](https://ruso.prensa-latina.cu/2025/04/30/%d0%b1%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d0%b2%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%87%d0%b0-%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2-%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd/)\n\n**BRICS Warns of Threat to Global Trade System Amid Trade War**\nThe BRICS countries have warned that the trade war initiated by Trump threatens the global trade system. During a meeting of foreign ministers in Rio, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, stated, 'In this changing world, the trust and mutual support [between Beijing and Moscow] remain unchanged.' The BRICS, which celebrated one of their first meetings since the expansion in 2023, failed to adopt a joint final declaration due to the reservations of Egypt and Ethiopia, two of the new members, regarding one of the 62 points of the declaration, related to the candidatures for the UN Security Council. Brazil considers that the growing difficulties in achieving consensus are compensated by the increased weight in the geopolitical landscape. The meeting of foreign ministers in Rio is a preparatory event for the summit that the global southern bloc will hold in the same city in July with the president of Brazil as host. The meeting included the five founding members of the BRICS and the six countries that joined in 2023 (Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran). The nine associated countries (Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, and Uzbekistan) also attended the session on Tuesday. The BRICS, established in 2009 after the financial crisis, now comprises a heterogeneous constellation of partners with significant demographic and economic weight. The 11 countries of the BRICS account for 3.3 billion people, 40% of the world's population, and their combined GDP represents 37% of the global GDP (China contributes 19% and India 8%), while the US and the EU account for around 15% each, according to World Economic Forum data. With the expansion, the bloc has increased its strength in the trade of primary materials, such as oil, with the BRICS now controlling half of the world's production and a third of the consumption.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 30, 2025 01:55 AM\nSource:[elpais.com](https://elpais.com/america/2025-04-29/los-brics-alertan-de-que-la-guerra-arancelaria-de-trump-amenaza-al-sistema-de-comercio-mundial.html)\n\n**BRICS Declaration Highlights Energy Transition and Global Governance Reform**\nThe first meeting of foreign ministers of the BRICS group after its expansion ended on Tuesday (29) with the release of the Brazilian presidency's declaration. The 62-paragraph document reflects the maturation of the group's priority themes, resulting from two sherpas meetings in February and last week. The document will serve as a basis for the leaders' declaration, which will be debated at the summit, scheduled for July 6-7 and will also take place in Rio de Janeiro. 'We discussed the role of the Global South in promoting multilateralism. This vision reflects our conviction that global challenges such as hunger, energy transition, digital exclusion, and climate emergency will not be overcome without a new architecture of international cooperation centered on solidarity, development, and peace,' said Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira, who coordinated the work. The Brazilian government announced on Tuesday that the ministers had submitted their positions on the reform of global governance and the strengthening of multilateralism and peace. The declaration of the presidency is the result of the effort between the highest authorities of diplomacy of the countries of the group. Ethiopia and Egypt objected to parts of paragraph 8. During the two days of the ministerial meeting, global and regional crises, reform of international institutions for more inclusive and sustainable governance, and the role of the Global South in strengthening multilateralism were discussed. The full participation of member countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran) and all partner countries (Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Nigeria) reinforces the active interest in coordinated action on the priorities of the Global South. The document highlights that this year, Brazil, in addition to presiding over the BRICS, will also host the COP30 (United Nations Climate Change Conference) in November, indicating that the group is willing to contribute with its best efforts to face the climate challenges. All member countries reiterated their commitment to the Paris Agreement, as well as to the strengthening of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the international forum appropriate and legitimate to discuss climate change in all its dimensions. The demand for developed countries to fulfill their obligations under the Convention and advance in the implementation of the decision on the new collective quantified target on climate finance also appears in the document. The declaration welcomes the 10th anniversary of the New Development Bank (NDB), reiterating its essentiality in promoting infrastructure and sustainable development of its member countries. The document presents agreement to make the NDB a new type of multilateral development bank of the 21st century and formalizes the acceptance of Brazilian Dilma Rousseff as president of the Bank for an additional five-year term. It was during Dilma's presidency of Brazil in 2015, when the country hosted the 6th BRICS Summit in Fortaleza (CE), that the institution was founded. Regarding social participation, considered in the People-to-People (P2P) pillar, the ministers reaffirmed the importance of BRICS inter-personal exchanges to improve mutual understanding, friendship, and cooperation. The declaration recognizes that interpersonal relationships are fundamental to enriching societies and developing economies. In this context, it was requested to promote greater effort in promoting respect for cultural diversity, valuing ancestry, innovation, and creativity, as well as defending robust interchanges and international cooperation between peoples. Last week, for the first time in history, representatives of civil society had formal space alongside the sherpas to present proposals directly to the main negotiators of the member countries during the 2nd Meeting of Sherpas of the group. The session represents a significant change in the way the group incorporates popular demands into its decision-making process.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 29, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/mundo/brics-declaracao-brasileira-destaca-transicao-energetica-e-reforma-da-governanca-global)\n\n**BRICS Foreign Ministers Meet in Rio, Oppose Global Trade War**\nThe meeting of foreign ministers of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) ended in Rio de Janeiro without a joint statement, but Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira stated that there was consensus to oppose a global trade war.

Trump made this threat in November, after BRICS countries raised the possibility of abandoning the US dollar as a reference currency in their transactions at their last summit in Kazan, Russia in October.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 09:09 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B6%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%82%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B3-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n**Brazil to Host Next BRICS Summit in July**\nBrazil announced on Saturday that the next BRICS summit will be held in Rio de Janeiro on July 6 and 7. Brazil will chair the group of emerging economies in 2025, focusing on promoting global governance reform and cooperation among Southern Hemisphere countries, according to a statement from the federal government. BRICS was established in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. The group expanded last year with the addition of Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the UAE. Saudi Arabia has been invited to join, and Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Malaysia have submitted formal membership requests, with several other countries expressing interest. The group recently welcomed Indonesia as its 11th member and Nigeria as a 'partner country', a classification introduced at the 2024 summit in Kazan. Brazil said that partner countries are also invited to participate in the summit and may attend other meetings if there is consensus among members. Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said, 'We will take decisive actions for development, cooperation, and improving the lives of all citizens in these countries.' US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose a 100% tariff on BRICS countries if they take steps to undermine the US dollar. BRICS leaders have pledged to create an independent payment system independent of the dollar.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 03:04 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=16022025&id=7ed2586a-f5df-4757-bb28-5035fb75e833)\n\n**Palestine Awaits BRICS Observer Status**\nThe Palestinian Liberation Organization's (OLP) Executive Committee member and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine Secretary General, Ahmad Majdalani, stated to Sputnik that Palestine is expecting to join the BRICS group as an observer. 'The BRICS is important for Palestine. We have already requested to join as an observer. We don't know when, but we are waiting for it to be approved,' Majdalani mentioned during the XIV Vald\u00e1i International Club of Debates Conference on the Middle East. Majdalani also highlighted that the presence of countries like Russia and China in the BRICS allows for the counterbalance of the economic power of the United States and the West, and enables the realization of fundamental tasks for the group. 'The BRICS is creating a new system of international relations based on multipolarity. We see this alliance as a kind of counterweight to the economic power of the United States and the West,' he added. In October 2024, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated that his country was willing to join the BRICS in any status, whether as a full member, associate, or observer. The BRICS group, initially composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has expanded its membership this year. In January 2024, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Iran joined, and in January 2025, Indonesia became a full member. Additionally, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, and Uzbekistan are currently associate members of the group.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 11:54 AM\nSource:[teleSURtv.net](https://www.telesurtv.net/palestina-espera-unirse-al-grupo-brcis-como-observador/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All seven experts converge on a low probability that a new country will be invited to join BRICS as a full member at the 17th BRICS Summit in July 2025. The core reasoning across perspectives centers on recent rapid expansion (notably from 2023\u20132025) which has induced institutional fatigue, capacity strains, and internal disagreement among members. Brazilian leadership, especially as summit host, is repeatedly cited as advocating a pause and consolidation, rather than further enlargement. The requirement for unanimity creates high barriers, with new and existing members expressing concerns about group cohesion, risk of rule-making paralysis, and political disagreements (underscored by failed joint declarations). The recent introduction of 'partner country' status is interpreted by all as a procedural move to manage expansion pressure without conferring full membership, further reducing short-term likelihood of upgrades. While demand from interested countries remains high and a small chance persists for a late political bargain\u2014due to strategic imperatives or a major geopolitical shock\u2014the consensus is that the most probable outcome is no new invitations for full membership at this summit. Most expert probability estimates cluster around 7\u201317%, with the modal forecast near 10%, reflecting a scenario that is not impossible but strongly disfavored by current signals and base rates."
