However, the absence of a termination clause, the fear of major penalties/arbitration, and BOTAS\u2019s economic interest in maintaining the deal all weigh heavily against short-term formal cancellation. European energy contract precedent shows even controversial deals tend to linger\u2014often for years\u2014before legal or negotiated off-ramps are found. Political posturing may be intended to increase leverage or extract renegotiation, rather than to trigger outright formal termination, especially within weeks. However, Bulgaria\u2019s insolvency risk, cabinet pressure, and mounting debt could spark an unplanned crisis; if, for example, Bulgargaz enters formal bankruptcy, or Turkey announces a cancellation in frustration at non-payment, a Yes outcome could occur. With less than a month to go and no moves toward a formal cancellation despite months of non-payment and high-level political criticism, the base rate for formal termination before July 1 is relatively low but not negligible \u2014 especially compared to the energy sector norm. I estimate a 25% chance of a Yes outcome, overweighting the possibility of an abrupt political gesture or a financial crisis igniting a formal announcement, but holding to the view that legal inertia and liability risk will preserve the status quo at least until after July 1.",

However, a formal, public cancellation (as opposed to de facto non-performance or a quiet restructuring/renegotiation) is unprecedented and fraught with legal risk, which could prompt delay. The lack of an explicit termination clause creates legal ambiguity, but the fine print of this question requires only that either party announces cancellation before July 1. On balance, given the pressure and the very short time frame, there is a substantial probability\u2014higher than base rates of contract terminations in European cross-border energy deals under normal conditions, but still less likely than not\u2014that cancellation will be publicly announced before July 1. The probability is higher than a coin-flip due to political desperation and bankruptcy risk, but uncertainty about the government's willingness to break norms, and possible last-minute renegotiation, moderates the likelihood.

Precedent in energy contract disputes is usually for arbitration/renegotiation, not outright unilateral termination, especially when lacking a termination clause. Nevertheless, the question's resolution language allows any public declaration by either party as sufficient, even if legally contested. With four weeks left, political and financial pressure could force Bulgaria\u2019s hand (or potentially provoke a BOTA\u015e declaration) as a desperate move to avoid bankruptcy or domestic instability. There are also precedents for countries invoking force majeure or economic distress to justify exit (even if the legal case is weak). The risk of a dramatic gesture before July 1 is sustained primarily by the resolution's low bar for what constitutes 'cancellation.' Balancing legal/political constraints with this permissive resolution criterion, I judge the probability to be moderately high, though far from certain.

That said, the political climate is highly combustible: public, high-profile statements announce a de facto intention to exit.

Nevertheless, the extreme, open nature of Bulgaria\u2019s crisis\u2014and the short time horizon\u2014means the likelihood of dramatic action (including a politically motivated, if legally contentious, cancellation by Bulgaria) is unusually high. EU\u2019s increasing willingness to provide legal cover for breaking such ties amplifies this. The news flow up through June 2025 is of intensifying crisis and very public friction, suggesting the risk of a sudden, face-saving announcement is nontrivial. Still, a majority of similar cases resolve with drawn-out disputes and the contract technically remaining in force, even if disregarded or being renegotiated.

The critiques centered around whether the risk is simply above base rates or truly in the coin-flip territory. On further reflection, and weighing more heavily the robust trend in comparative cases where even dire crises drag on without outright cancellation, I believe my initial probability of 63% slightly overstates the immediacy and neglects the strong evidence that both sides are using every delay and renegotiation tool available.

Even regime theorists concede that a 'populist or bankruptcy-driven announcement' could break the usual pattern. The arbitration/negotiation-focused forecasters pressed that the situation is a coin flip, not a long slog\u2014arguing that in this context, institutional breakdowns can be sudden, particularly with looming bankruptcy and explicit political calls. As such, the combination of: (1) clear crisis escalation; (2) political leadership seeking an exit as a matter of public record; (3) no credible signal of imminent relief or renegotiation; and (4) permissive resolution criteria (unilateral declaration counts) suggests my initial 28% was too conservative.

The most bullish forecasters for 'Yes' rely heavily on the optics of acute political crisis, but even their arguments struggle to identify an imminent, concrete trigger for a public cancellation announcement.

The most cogent critiques reinforce my view: even historic crises in interstate gas contracts tend toward muddling through, protracted disputes, and incremental renegotiations\u2014not abrupt, publicized cancellations, especially under contract structures lacking termination clauses. The fact that the contract can be cancelled by mere public statement is the major factor for upside risk, but as others point out, even with this lowered bar, there is no direct evidence (so far) of such intent by either party. Arguments for probabilities in the low- to mid-teens are anchored in both base rate reality and sound contract analysis, while those for much higher odds rely on crisis exaggeration rather than concrete signals of imminent rupture.

Most of the more grounded, sector-informed arguments consistently emphasized the durability of these deals even amid overt political acrimony, bankruptcy peril, and high-profile rhetoric. The permissive resolution criteria (any party's public statement counts) do raise the theoretical chance of a dramatic move, but the lack of concrete signs (bankruptcy filings, explicit government orders, Turkish escalation, etc.) so close to the deadline restrains the upside risk. The balance of evidence\u2014base rate, legal inertia, and the extended history of headline-level drama not translating into outright cancellation\u2014suggests my initial 44% was too high. A more defensible estimate, acknowledging elevated but not near-even odds, should be in the 25-30% range.

The company 'effectively froze' its efforts on the project, after months of studying the feasibility of using Turkish territory as an alternative entry point to Europe, especially with the expected shutdown of the Nord Stream pipelines and the halt of gas transit through Ukraine by the end of 2024. Despite the public political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, the project faced technical and political challenges that hindered its implementation. Some Gazprom managers were skeptical of the project's viability from the start, even before the details of the project's organizational and infrastructure requirements became clear. According to sources, Turkey did not have sufficient export capacity to the southern European market, and Ankara refused to grant Gazprom the right to market gas jointly, which limited the potential Russian influence in the proposed center. Additionally, Turkey was planning to market gas itself, while Gazprom would only be a supplier, which the Russian company considered a loss of control. Meanwhile, the European Union is moving forward with a plan to ban Russian gas imports entirely by 2027, reducing Moscow's chances of regaining its energy influence in the continent. The idea of the Turkish center was first proposed by Putin in October 2022, after the Nord Stream explosions, when he expressed his desire to establish an alternative route to deliver up to 55 billion cubic meters per year to Europe through the Black Sea and Turkey. However, the project was not originally Gazprom's idea, but rather born in circles close to the Kremlin, according to a well-informed source. Some export department employees were surprised by Putin's public promotion of the initiative, despite it not being economically studied in depth. Despite some Turkish officials' interest in the project and their ambition to make their country a regional hub for gas trade at competitive local prices, the plan has seen little progress. Gazprom and the office of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, responsible for the energy sector, did not respond to Bloomberg's requests for comment. The Turkish Ministry of Energy and the state-owned pipeline operator Botas also declined to comment officially, while a Turkish official, who wished to remain anonymous, said that Turkey remains open to cooperation with Russia on the project, but acknowledged that the process 'has been delayed for a long time'. Bloomberg reported that the freeze on the project does not affect the current contracts between Gazprom and Turkey, which remains one of the company's major gas consumers. However, this development shows the extent to which Moscow's options for regaining its influence in the European gas market have narrowed in the current political climate. After being the largest gas supplier to Europe through several land and sea routes, Russia now finds itself confined to limited corners of the global market, seeking geostrategic alliances rather than commercial solutions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2025/6/4/%d8%ba%d8%a7%d8%b2%d8%a8%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%85-%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d9%83%d9%8a%d8%a7)\n\n**Company 'Nefteservis' Prepares Plan to Exit Financial Crisis**\nThe company 'Nefteservis', a contractor for oil companies in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, has prepared a plan to exit the financial crisis. The company will increase the volume of work and raise prices, according to a representative of the company. 'The company has prepared a forecast plan for exiting the crisis and a financial model for recovery, which provide for achieving sustainable positive profitability within 1.5-3 years. Negotiations are underway with customers to increase the cost of a brigade-hour and transition to separate pricing for transportation services, which has already led to an increase in revenue,' said the source of the agency. The company explained that the billion-dollar debt previously reported was not confirmed. The amount of 78 million rubles is the company's obligations to the tax authority. Other debts are still being considered by the court. The total amount of creditors' claims does not exceed 1 billion rubles, according to the company's representative. 'Nefteservis' attributes its financial problems to sanctions, rising prices, equipment and personnel shortages. Before the bankruptcy case was initiated, the company signed a settlement agreement with the tax authority, but was unable to fulfill it due to changes in the economic situation in the country and a subsequent decline in revenue. The company is currently trying to get back on track. In 2024, they reinstated some of the laid-off employees, hired new ones, agreed with customers to raise prices to increase revenue, and also raised wages and continue to search for qualified employees, including from neighboring countries.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 01:14 PM\nSource:[URA.RU](https://ura.news/news/1052944144)\n\n**Gazprom Abandons Major Investment Project in Turkey**\nAccording to unnamed sources speaking to Bloomberg, Gazprom has decided to abandon its major investment project in Turkey after months of feasibility studies. The project's inability to be sustainable was due to the insufficient capacity of the pipelines connecting Turkey to Bulgaria and Greece. Some company officials have stated that the project's chances of success were low from the start. The article suggests that the idea of building a natural gas center in Turkey was more closely associated with Kremlin's inner circles rather than Gazprom. The sudden announcement of the project by Russian President Vladimir Putin in October 2024 caught Gazprom off guard, and the project lacked internal support. The cancellation of the project is a significant blow to Gazprom, which relies heavily on natural gas exports to Europe, generating approximately $8 billion per month. The project was crucial for Gazprom's strategic plan to offset losses, but its cancellation has effectively ended this plan.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[haber3.com](https://www.haber3.com/ekonomi/gazprom-turkiyedeki-dev-yatirimindan-vazgecti-haberi-6228324)\n\n**Spain and Netherlands Support EU Plan to Abandon Russian Gas, France and Belgium Do Not**\nSpain and the Netherlands are in favor of the EU's plan to abandon Russian gas, while France and Belgium are not. According to Politico, the two countries are willing to support the EU law that would cancel contracts for buying gas from Russia, as it implies a ban on short-term purchases this year and long-term contracts by 2027. This was confirmed by representatives of the countries. The law would exempt Spain and the Netherlands from long-term commitments under contracts for buying Russian LNG, as explained by the authors. 'It implies a ban on short-term purchases this year and long-term contracts by 2027,' said a representative. 'This would free us from long-term obligations,' added another. 'We are willing to support the law,' said a third. 'It's a step in the right direction,' said a fourth. 'We need to reduce our dependence on Russian gas,' said a fifth. 'This law would help us achieve that goal,' said a sixth.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 10:24 AM\nSource:[Delfi](https://rus.delfi.lv/biznes/37448597/economy/120075093/franciya-i-belgiya-ne-podderzhivayut-plan-es-po-otkazu-ot-rossiyskogo-gaza)\n\n**Gazprom Shelves Plans for Turkish Gas Hub Amid EU Sanctions and Turkish Reluctance**\nGazprom has put on hold plans to create a gas hub in Turkey, which was previously praised by Russian President Vladimir Putin, closing the door on potential opportunities to regain lost market share in Europe, according to Bloomberg. The plan, which was first proposed by Putin in October 2022, aimed to create a gas hub in Turkey that would have rivaled the capacity of the damaged Nord Stream pipeline, with a capacity of around 55 billion cubic meters per year. However, after several months of consideration, Gazprom has decided that the project is 'not feasible and largely stalled', according to sources. The decision closes the door on Gazprom's ability to regain, at least some, of its lost gas supply to Europe, which previously brought in around $8 billion per month. However, some in the company remain skeptical about the feasibility of the Turkish plan, citing concerns about the lack of free export pipelines in Turkey and Ankara's reluctance to allow Gazprom to sell gas jointly, limiting Russia's influence in the region. The European Union has also imposed a proposal to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027. 'Despite Putin's public praise for the idea in October, it has always faced serious problems', writes the newspaper. 'Turkey does not have free export pipelines to Southern Europe, and Ankara did not want to allow Gazprom to sell gas jointly, limiting Russia's influence in the region', say sources. 'The European Union has also imposed a proposal to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027', adds the newspaper. 'Gazprom has studied the details of the proposal, but has lost interest in the project', according to sources. 'As the company explored the details of the proposal, it became increasingly clear that the project was not feasible', said one source. 'The ability of Turkish pipelines to Greece and Bulgaria, which are EU members, was too limited to handle significant additional supplies', added the source. 'Such limited potential for cross-flows undermines the prospect of a full-scale Turkish hub with its own price index', said the source. 'Bulgaria is in talks with US investors to expand the Turkish stream', writes the newspaper. 'Last year, at a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Putin repeated that the Turkish idea is still on the agenda and will help create 'balanced pricing mechanisms' for Russian gas', writes the newspaper. However, there were already signs that ambitions were being scaled back, as previously they had excluded storing large volumes of Russian gas in Turkey, which is a prerequisite for a large hub, writes the newspaper. 'Gazprom's leaders have long stopped discussing the Turkish hub both within the country and at meetings with state officials', say sources. 'Turkey's position on gas plans has not changed, and it is still willing to cooperate with Russia within a joint venture for this initiative', said a Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as the discussion is private. However, as acknowledged by the official, the process has been delayed for some time. 'The shelving of the project does not affect Gazprom's current business with Turkey, which remains one of its largest gas buyers', notes Bloomberg. However, it shows that in Russia, once the largest supplier of pipeline gas to Europe, there was an opportunity to regain its influence in the region in the current political climate, according to Bloomberg.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 05:36 PM\nSource:[kritika.news](https://www.kritika.news/rf-vidmovlya%d1%94tsya-vid-ide%d1%97-tureczkogo-habu-dlya-dostupu-na-gazovij-rinok-%d1%94vropi-popri-pidtrimku-putina-ranishe-bloomberg/)\n\n**American Company Transatlantic Leaves Kozluk-\u015eelmo Oil Field in Batman**\nThe Kozluk-\u015eelmo oil field in Batman's Kozluk district has changed hands after 20 years.

TPAO's Batman Regional Directorate has taken over the site and has begun preparations for production. As one of the highest-producing oil fields in the region, the site's departure from Transatlantic marks a significant change for the area.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 10:35 PM\nSource:[Yeni Akit Gazetesi](https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/foto-galeri/amerikalilardan-sasirtan-turkiye-karari-o-ilimizdeki-80-petrol-kuyusunu-terk-ettiler-115429)\n\n**Gazprom Abandons Turkish Gas Distribution Center Plan**\nAccording to Bloomberg, Russian gas company Gazprom has quietly abandoned its plan to build a gas distribution center in Turkey, which was intended to help the company regain its foothold in the European energy market, which it largely lost since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The company 'effectively froze' its efforts on the project, after months of studying the feasibility of using Turkish territory as an alternative entry point to Europe, especially with the expected shutdown of the Nord Stream pipelines and the halt of gas transit through Ukraine by the end of 2024. Despite the public political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, the project faced technical and political challenges that hindered its implementation. Some Gazprom managers were skeptical of the project's viability from the start, even before the details of the project's organizational and infrastructure requirements became clear. According to sources, Turkey did not have sufficient export capacity to the southern European market, and Ankara refused to grant Gazprom the right to market gas jointly, which limited the potential Russian influence in the proposed center. Additionally, Turkey was planning to market gas itself, while Gazprom would only be a supplier, which the Russian company considered a loss of control. Meanwhile, the European Union is moving forward with a plan to ban Russian gas imports entirely by 2027, reducing Moscow's chances of regaining its energy influence in the continent. The idea of the Turkish center was first proposed by Putin in October 2022, after the Nord Stream explosions, when he expressed his desire to establish an alternative route to deliver up to 55 billion cubic meters per year to Europe through the Black Sea and Turkey. However, the project was not originally Gazprom's idea, but rather born in circles close to the Kremlin, according to a well-informed source. Some export department employees were surprised by Putin's public promotion of the initiative, despite it not being economically studied in depth. Despite some Turkish officials' interest in the project and their ambition to make their country a regional hub for gas trade at competitive local prices, the plan has seen little progress. Gazprom and the office of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, responsible for the energy sector, did not respond to Bloomberg's requests for comment. The Turkish Ministry of Energy and the state-owned pipeline operator Botas also declined to comment officially, while a Turkish official, who wished to remain anonymous, said that Turkey remains open to cooperation with Russia on the project, but acknowledged that the process 'has been delayed for a long time'. Bloomberg reported that the freeze on the project does not affect the current contracts between Gazprom and Turkey, which remains one of the company's major gas consumers. However, this development shows the extent to which Moscow's options for regaining its influence in the European gas market have narrowed in the current political climate. After being the largest gas supplier to Europe through several land and sea routes, Russia now finds itself confined to limited corners of the global market, seeking geostrategic alliances rather than commercial solutions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2025/6/4/%d8%ba%d8%a7%d8%b2%d8%a8%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%85-%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d9%83%d9%8a%d8%a7)\n\n**EU Plans to 'Zero Out' Russian Gas Imports: What This Means**\nThe European Commission plans to present a project of regulatory acts on the gradual refusal of Russian energy imports by the end of 2027, which includes the introduction of a zero quota for the import of 'blue fuel' from Russia, according to Bloomberg. The presentation is expected to take place on June 17. The package of measures will also include instruments for the gradual refusal of Russian oil and restrictions on new contracts for the supply of uranium and other nuclear materials. The zero quota for the import of Russian 'blue fuel' will allow European companies to rely on force majeure circumstances to terminate agreements with Russian suppliers. It will be directly applicable in all EU member states, and officials expect its effectiveness to be comparable to the sanctions regime. However, the actual ban on Russian gas imports will require the support of a qualified majority from national governments and a majority of European Parliament deputies. The quota system for Russian gas imports will not require the support of all 27 member states, allowing the EU to bypass the veto of Hungary and Slovakia, which continue to import Russian pipeline gas. According to the European Commission's two-stage roadmap, it aims to ban short-term contracts for Russian gas imports by the end of 2025. The EU plans to completely refuse 'blue fuel' from Russia by the end of 2027. As reported by UNIAN, the EU plans to refuse Russian oil imports by the end of 2027 in addition to the announced cessation of Russian gas consumption. However, there is no consensus in the EU on a complete ban on the import of 'blue fuel' from Russia. France and Belgium are still refusing to support the European Commission's plan to ban Russian gas imports, as they are concerned about potential lawsuits from Russia.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 03:20 PM\nSource:[unian](https://www.unian.ua/economics/energetics/yevroyuz-zbirayetsya-obnuliti-rosiyskiy-gaz-shcho-peredbachaye-cey-plan-13028649.html)\n\n**Company 'Nefteservis' Prepares Plan to Exit Financial Crisis**\nThe company 'Nefteservis', a contractor for oil companies in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, has prepared a plan to exit the financial crisis. The company will increase the volume of work and raise prices, according to a representative of the company. 'The company has prepared a forecast plan for exiting the crisis and a financial model for recovery, which provide for achieving sustainable positive profitability within 1.5-3 years. Negotiations are underway with customers to increase the cost of a brigade-hour and transition to separate pricing for transportation services, which has already led to an increase in revenue,' said the source of the agency. The company explained that the billion-dollar debt previously reported was not confirmed. The amount of 78 million rubles is the company's obligations to the tax authority. Other debts are still being considered by the court. The total amount of creditors' claims does not exceed 1 billion rubles, according to the company's representative. 'Nefteservis' attributes its financial problems to sanctions, rising prices, equipment and personnel shortages. Before the bankruptcy case was initiated, the company signed a settlement agreement with the tax authority, but was unable to fulfill it due to changes in the economic situation in the country and a subsequent decline in revenue. The company is currently trying to get back on track. In 2024, they reinstated some of the laid-off employees, hired new ones, agreed with customers to raise prices to increase revenue, and also raised wages and continue to search for qualified employees, including from neighboring countries.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 01:14 PM\nSource:[URA.RU](https://ura.news/news/1052944144)\n\n**EU Risks Falling Behind Progress: Why France and Belgium Refuse to Ban Russian LNG**\nFrance and Belgium, two of the main buyers of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the EU, have refused to support the EU's plan to ban the import of Russian LNG. According to Politico, the two countries argue that they need more information about the economic and legal consequences of such a move. 'France, the largest buyer in the block, told Politico that it prefers a strategy of finding alternative sources of supply. Belgium, in second place, wants a detailed report on the economic consequences before making a decision,' the article says. France plans to replace Russian supplies with Qatari products, while Belgium wants to continue receiving Russian gas until 2035. However, both countries have expressed concerns about the 'legal certainty' of the EU's proposal, fearing that many companies may face lawsuits from Moscow over broken contracts. 'Existing contracts must be legally protected,' said French Energy Minister Mark Ferracci. Belgium, which plans to continue receiving Russian gas until 2035, wants the EU to fully address its concerns and 'requests a detailed impact assessment' of the refusal to Russian LNG. 'This is a problem for some EU countries, not just a financial and political issue, but also a question of development prospects,' said GIS Mining CEO Vasiliy Giry. 'Some countries, like the Baltic states, can afford to give up Russian gas due to alternative supplies. Others, like Hungary and Slovakia, continue to buy gas from Russia through the 'Turkish Stream'. For France and Belgium, such supplies are also relevant, with a balance of price and volume. Gas comes in the form of LNG,' he explained. However, the expert noted that energy is a weak point for the West. 'Energy deficit, nuclear energy, and gas in today's realities cannot provide the impetus for the long-awaited economic growth. Energy-intensive industries with high added value are gradually winding down and leaving the EU. This is particularly relevant to the industrial mining and digital currency markets, which require energy supplies and guarantees of stability,' he concluded. The EU Commission presented a plan to gradually abandon Russian energy resources in early May. The initiative provides for the complete cessation of gas imports from Russia by 2027, through the suspension of new contracts with Russian suppliers and the termination of spot contracts by the end of 2025. However, some countries in the block are negative about the idea of a complete ban on Russian LNG. Hungary and Slovakia are among the critics.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 11:36 AM\nSource:[RT \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c](https://russian.rt.com/world/article/1488040-franciya-belgiya-gaz-rossiya)\n\n**Gazprom Abandons Major Investment Project in Turkey**\nAccording to unnamed sources speaking to Bloomberg, Gazprom has decided to abandon its major investment project in Turkey after months of feasibility studies. The project's inability to be sustainable was due to the insufficient capacity of the pipelines connecting Turkey to Bulgaria and Greece. Some company officials have stated that the project's chances of success were low from the start. The article suggests that the idea of building a natural gas center in Turkey was more closely associated with Kremlin's inner circles rather than Gazprom. The sudden announcement of the project by Russian President Vladimir Putin in October 2024 caught Gazprom off guard, and the project lacked internal support. The cancellation of the project is a significant blow to Gazprom, which relies heavily on natural gas exports to Europe, generating approximately $8 billion per month. The project was crucial for Gazprom's strategic plan to offset losses, but its cancellation has effectively ended this plan.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[haber3.com](https://www.haber3.com/ekonomi/gazprom-turkiyedeki-dev-yatirimindan-vazgecti-haberi-6228324)\n\n**Spain and Netherlands Support EU Plan to Abandon Russian Gas, France and Belgium Do Not**\nSpain and the Netherlands are in favor of the EU's plan to abandon Russian gas, while France and Belgium are not.

This was confirmed by representatives of the countries. The law would exempt Spain and the Netherlands from long-term commitments under contracts for buying Russian LNG, as explained by the authors. 'It implies a ban on short-term purchases this year and long-term contracts by 2027,' said a representative. 'This would free us from long-term obligations,' added another.

According to Politico, the two countries, the largest European buyers of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), refuse to support the EC's roadmap. France's Energy Minister, M. Ferracci, stated that France, the largest buyer of Russian LNG, prefers a strategy of finding alternative sources, specifically replacing Russian supplies with Qatari LNG. Belgium, the second-largest buyer, wants a detailed report on the economic consequences before making a decision. Spain and the Netherlands, the other two major importers of Russian LNG in the EU, have expressed their willingness to support the EC's initiative. The EC presented a draft roadmap for implementing the REPowerEU plan on May 6, 2025, which aims to stop all Russian gas imports in the EU by the end of 2027. The document aims to increase transparency, strengthen control, and trackability of Russian gas on EU markets. New contracts with Russian gas suppliers will be banned, and spot contracts (with immediate payment) will be terminated by the end of 2025. The EC has promised to present specific legislative proposals in support of the REPowerEU plan's roadmap in June 2025. The EC is considering introducing a zero-quota on Russian gas imports, which would allow companies importing gas from EU countries to avoid penalties for existing contracts, citing force majeure. Unlike direct sanctions, which require unanimous approval, a quota can be implemented with the support of a majority of EU countries. However, such support is currently lacking. France requires legal certainty, as its largest importers fear they may face lawsuits from Russia due to contract termination. TotalEnergies, a major importer of Russian LNG, has a contract with the Yamal LNG project that runs until 2032 and involves 4 million tons of LNG per year. Belgium's Fluxys has a long-term contract with Yamal LNG until 2039, which involves 8 million tons of LNG per year and would cost the company 750 million euros to terminate. After the EU's 14th sanctions package, which banned the re-export of Russian LNG, went into effect on March 20, 2025, the company did not experience any significant difficulties, as it still had opportunities to realize its LNG within the EU.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/gosreg/890500-nuzhna-konkretika-frantsiya-i-belgiya-ne-podderzhali-plan-ek-po-otkazu-ot-rossiyskogo-gaza/)\n\n**SOCAR and 'M-Gaz' Joint Initiative to Produce CNG from Azerbaijani Gas in Bulgaria**\nSOCAR and 'M-Gaz' have a joint initiative to produce compressed natural gas (CNG) from Azerbaijani gas in Bulgaria. This project is seen as a promising opportunity for the region, as it would provide a cleaner and more efficient alternative to coal for heating and electricity production. According to Mihail Manolov, the head of 'M-Gaz', the production of CNG from Azerbaijani gas in Bulgaria is a cost-effective solution, requiring only 25 million manats, compared to the high costs of building gas pipelines. The project aims to cover not only social and industrial objects in Bulgaria, but also potentially neighboring countries such as North Macedonia. Manolov noted that the current gas pipeline connecting Bulgaria and North Macedonia is leased to 'Gazprom' until 2030, but the EU rules allow for half of the pipeline's capacity to be allocated to other non-Russian gas sources. He believes that this project is very promising, especially in light of the EU's desire to reduce its dependence on Russian gas due to the war in Ukraine. 'This fact, combined with the desire of most European countries to abandon gas cooperation with Russia, makes the SOCAR and 'M-Gaz' project very promising,' Manolov said. 'The production of CNG from Azerbaijani gas in Bulgaria, where it is the cheapest gas, is a very profitable idea. This is understood by SOCAR,' he added.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 08:44 AM\nSource:[\"Insan Haqlar\u0131 U\u011frunda\" \u0130ctimai Birlik](https://haqqin.az/news/350259)\n\n**Gazprom Shelves Plans for Turkish Gas Hub Amid EU Sanctions and Turkish Reluctance**\nGazprom has put on hold plans to create a gas hub in Turkey, which was previously praised by Russian President Vladimir Putin, closing the door on potential opportunities to regain lost market share in Europe, according to Bloomberg. The plan, which was first proposed by Putin in October 2022, aimed to create a gas hub in Turkey that would have rivaled the capacity of the damaged Nord Stream pipeline, with a capacity of around 55 billion cubic meters per year. However, after several months of consideration, Gazprom has decided that the project is 'not feasible and largely stalled', according to sources. The decision closes the door on Gazprom's ability to regain, at least some, of its lost gas supply to Europe, which previously brought in around $8 billion per month. However, some in the company remain skeptical about the feasibility of the Turkish plan, citing concerns about the lack of free export pipelines in Turkey and Ankara's reluctance to allow Gazprom to sell gas jointly, limiting Russia's influence in the region. The European Union has also imposed a proposal to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027. 'Despite Putin's public praise for the idea in October, it has always faced serious problems', writes the newspaper. 'Turkey does not have free export pipelines to Southern Europe, and Ankara did not want to allow Gazprom to sell gas jointly, limiting Russia's influence in the region', say sources. 'The European Union has also imposed a proposal to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027', adds the newspaper. 'Gazprom has studied the details of the proposal, but has lost interest in the project', according to sources. 'As the company explored the details of the proposal, it became increasingly clear that the project was not feasible', said one source. 'The ability of Turkish pipelines to Greece and Bulgaria, which are EU members, was too limited to handle significant additional supplies', added the source. 'Such limited potential for cross-flows undermines the prospect of a full-scale Turkish hub with its own price index', said the source. 'Bulgaria is in talks with US investors to expand the Turkish stream', writes the newspaper. 'Last year, at a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Putin repeated that the Turkish idea is still on the agenda and will help create 'balanced pricing mechanisms' for Russian gas', writes the newspaper. However, there were already signs that ambitions were being scaled back, as previously they had excluded storing large volumes of Russian gas in Turkey, which is a prerequisite for a large hub, writes the newspaper. 'Gazprom's leaders have long stopped discussing the Turkish hub both within the country and at meetings with state officials', say sources. 'Turkey's position on gas plans has not changed, and it is still willing to cooperate with Russia within a joint venture for this initiative', said a Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as the discussion is private. However, as acknowledged by the official, the process has been delayed for some time. 'The shelving of the project does not affect Gazprom's current business with Turkey, which remains one of its largest gas buyers', notes Bloomberg. However, it shows that in Russia, once the largest supplier of pipeline gas to Europe, there was an opportunity to regain its influence in the region in the current political climate, according to Bloomberg.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 05:36 PM\nSource:[kritika.news](https://www.kritika.news/rf-vidmovlya%d1%94tsya-vid-ide%d1%97-tureczkogo-habu-dlya-dostupu-na-gazovij-rinok-%d1%94vropi-popri-pidtrimku-putina-ranishe-bloomberg/)\n\n**Bulgaria's Energy Giant on Brink of Bankruptcy Due to 88 Billion TL Debt**\nBulgaria's energy giant Bulgargaz is on the brink of bankruptcy due to its 88 billion TL debt to BOTA\u015e.

The Turkmen government stated that the agreement with BOTAS to transport Turkmen natural gas through Iran to Turkey via SWAP was reached yesterday. The agreement does not specify the amount of gas 'Turkmenneft' will supply to Turkey or the delivery schedule. Bajratli said that the deal will increase the security of natural gas supplies to Turkey and strengthen strategic cooperation between the two countries. 'With this agreement, which we have been working on for many years, we will further advance strategic cooperation between the two countries, while strengthening the security of natural gas supplies to our country and the region,' said the Turkish Minister of Energy, according to the statement. Turkmenistan, the largest natural gas producer in Central Asia, reduced its gas production to 77.6 billion cubic meters in 2024 from 80.6 billion cubic meters the previous year. China is the main buyer of Turkmen gas. A five-year contract with 'Gazprom', which purchased up to 5.5 billion cubic meters of gas per year, expired on June 30, 2024.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[\"Insan Haqlar\u0131 U\u011frunda\" \u0130ctimai Birlik](https://haqqin.az/news/339912)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across the panel, forecasters agree that the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey is under acute and unprecedented stress: Bulgargaz faces imminent insolvency, Bulgaria\u2019s top political figures (including the Prime Minister and parliamentary leadership) have publicly called for an exit, and payment default has persisted for almost a year. However, there is near-unanimity that the contract\u2019s rigid structure\u2014with a 'take-or-pay' clause and no early termination provision\u2014makes formal, public cancellation extremely difficult and risky for Bulgaria, due to probable severe legal and financial penalties. Most experts point to historical precedent that such contracts, especially between states and particularly in the European energy sector, rarely see outright cancellation within short time frames; instead, disputes more commonly drag on through arbitration, renegotiation, or political stalling. Experts from both legal and policy perspectives note that the threshold for a Yes here\u2014any public announcement of cancellation from either side\u2014does slightly elevate the probability, since political crisis or bankruptcy might prompt a unilateral move even if not strictly legal. Nevertheless, the inertia of past cases, ongoing negotiations, and Turkey\u2019s interest in maintaining the deal all weigh against imminent rupture. Probability estimates cluster between 15% and 32% for a cancellation announcement before July 1, with outlier forecasts reaching as high as 60% and 63%, based on the exceptional scale of Bulgaria's financial and political crisis. The consensus is that while the situation is volatile and a last-minute, politically-driven declaration cannot be excluded, the more likely outcome is continued impasse, renegotiation or legal dispute, rather than overt, pre-deadline cancellation. In summary: formal cancellation remains unlikely within the tight timeframe, despite significant and intensifying political, economic, and institutional pressure."
