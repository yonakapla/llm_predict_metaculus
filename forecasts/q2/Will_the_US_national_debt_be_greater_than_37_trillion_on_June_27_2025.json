No fiscal reforms, spending cuts, or revenue windfalls are in evidence. Even high-profile warnings and political acrimony have not translated into meaningful, actionable change, and the US historically resolves debt ceiling standoffs before technical default. Interest costs and deficits are accelerating, reinforcing mechanical debt growth. Even accounting for the very slim possibility of a temporary political/technical freeze, the baseline (supported by both fiscal arithmetic and historical precedent) is for the debt to decisively exceed $37T on or before June 27, 2025.

This is an 11.6% increase from the same period last year. The Treasury attributed the minimal increase in debt to the appreciation of the peso, which reduced the effect of additional borrowings. The government remains on track to achieve fiscal consolidation and reduce the debt ratio to below 60% by 2028. The Treasury stated, 'The government continues to follow a disciplined debt strategy, ensuring that borrowings support productive investments while keeping fiscal sustainability.' As of end-April, 91.7% of the outstanding debt carries fixed interest rates, and 82% of the obligations are long-term. The country's domestic debt, at P11.59 trillion, increased by 1.85% on a monthly basis and jumped 12.44% from P10.31 trillion in April 2024. The peso appreciation also contributed to a P3.85-billion reduction in the overall domestic debt valuation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[Philstar.com](https://www.philstar.com/business/2025/06/04/2447968/debt-rises-fresh-high-p1675-trillion)\n\n**G7 debt is now a pressure point for anxious markets**\nThe surge in government debt levels is becoming a pressure point for big economies, with bond investors focusing on the US and Japan. The US has shot to the top of the worry list after a sharp bond sell-off in April, with concerns over President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, which could add $3.3 trillion to debt by 2034. Moody's decision to strip the US of its last triple-A credit rating and JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon's warning of a 'crack in the bond market' due to overspending have added to concerns. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the country will never default, and investors believe authorities will prevent 10-year yields from rising too far above 4.5%. In Japan, public debt at more than twice its economy is the biggest among developed economies, with longer-dated bond yields hitting record highs in May. The culprit is waning demand for longer-dated paper from traditional buyers, and policymakers are considering trimming super-long bond sales to soothe market concerns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 04:14 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The government's borrowing cost is rising, and interest on the national debt is increasing rapidly. In fiscal 2024, interest expense exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, and projections suggest it will break that record in fiscal 2025. The country has the highest debt interest payment to GDP ratio of any developed economy, currently around 4.6 percent. Analyst Greg Weldon calls this a 'debt tsunami.' The Federal Reserve's ability to intervene with rate cuts is limited, and quantitative easing (QE) has created more problems than it has solved. QE has distorted interest rates, incentivized massive levels of debt, and created misallocations of economic resources. The overall long-term impact of QE is overwhelmingly negative, and the national debt matters. As one expert notes, 'The highway is going off a cliff, and we passed the last exit a long time ago.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:26 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

The government spends more on interest payments on the national debt than on national defense. The CATO Institute projects that the US will pay $2 trillion in interest payments on all this debt in the next 10 years. The annual fiscal deficit is projected to rise to $2.7 trillion by 2035, and the national debt will reach over $58 trillion, which is nearly 130% of GDP. Moody's has cut the US sovereign credit rating down one notch, citing the growing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit. The credit ratings agency expects federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9% of GDP by 2035. The US is heading for a 'Liz Truss moment', where investors revolt against the government's fiscal policies, leading to extreme interest rate volatility and a full revolt in bond prices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 07:29 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/americas-dire-fiscal-condition-signals-deeper-debt-crisis-ahead-200661200)\n\n**Opinion: America's financial house is out of order**\nMoody's Investors Service downgraded the United States' credit rating to Aa1, citing soaring debt, chronic deficits, and rising interest rates.

Federal spending continues to surge, with a projected $2 trillion deficit and interest payments exceeding $1 trillion annually. The author argues that a return to pre-pandemic spending levels, annual public comparisons of budget categories, and a long-term plan to reduce debt as a percent of GDP are necessary to restore public trust and fiscal discipline. This is not a call for austerity, but for accountability and long-term survival.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 12:05 AM\nSource:[The Detroit News](https://eu.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2025/05/22/opinion-americas-financial-house-is-out-of-order/83790283007/)\n\n**Debunking the Rumor: 6.6 Trillion US Debt in June 2025**\nRecently, there has been a widespread rumor that $660 billion in US debt will mature in June 2025, and the US government may not be able to repay it, leading to a debt default. However, the author believes that this rumor is a 'self-blackening whitening' tactic, where a false rumor is spread to be easily debunked, and if it is not debunked, it is used as evidence that the US debt is not a problem. In reality, the US debt is not just a problem in June 2025, but every month. According to the US Treasury Department's April report, $214 billion in short-term debt matured in May, which is roughly the current monthly short-term debt scale. Assuming that the June short-term debt scale will not be significantly different from May, the author estimates that the June debt scale will be around $230 billion. Last year's June debt scale was $210 billion, and this year's will likely be slightly higher, but not exceeding $300 billion.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 12:44 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250522/48370668.html)\n\n**Debunking the '6.6 Trillion Dollar Debt Bomb' Myth: A Closer Look at US Debt**\nA recent online rumor claims that $666 billion in US debt will mature in June 2025, potentially leading to a default crisis. However, this claim is based on false data and may be a deliberate attempt to downplay the long-term and systemic nature of the US debt crisis. According to the US Treasury Department's latest debt data, the actual amount of debt maturing in June 2025 is around $127 billion for short-term bills and $1.45 trillion in total. This number is unlikely to exceed $2.3 trillion, far from the claimed $666 billion. The rumor's danger lies in creating a 'concentration explosion expectation' that will be easily dismissed if June passes without incident, diverting attention from the structural problems of US debt. The real concern is the US Treasury Department's monthly massive short-term debt 'relay' operation, where $20 billion or more in short-term debt matures every month, and is replaced by new debt. This has become a routine operation, with $2.36 trillion in debt maturing in March and $2.8 trillion in April, showing that debt rollover has become a normal part of fiscal operations.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 07:08 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20250522/48369423.html)\n\n**US' mounting debt burden fuels national economic concerns**\nThe US national debt has reached $36.2 trillion, posing significant long-term risks to economic growth, employment, investments, and wages. Rating agency Moody's downgraded the US' credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the rise in public debt and interest payments. The US Department of Treasury data showed that the federal government's budget deficit is at $1.05 trillion as of April, with the deficit standing at $855.2 billion in the same period last year. The US' debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 123% in the fiscal year 2024, indicating the government will face more challenges to repay the debt. The aging population, increasing healthcare costs, and rapidly rising debt interest are some of the main drivers of the rise in the government's spending. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will rise from 5.8% of GDP in 2025 to 8.1% in 2055. The growing national debt of the US and high interest rates lead to a larger share of the government budget to be allocated to interest payments. The Treasury said that the interest expenses are expected to reach $579 billion by April in fiscal 2025. The rise in interest expenses can damage potential investment opportunities in the public and private sectors. Peter G. Peterson Foundation said the rise in debt causes serious concerns for long-term fiscal sustainability, emphasizing that the increasing debt will have significant impact on the economy in the absence of policy changes. If continued, the current debt increase trend will lead the US economy to shrink $340 billion in 2035, $1.1 trillion in 2055, and $1.8 trillion in 2075.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 20, 2025 01:41 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-mounting-debt-burden-fuels-national-economic-concerns/3574063)\n\n**US Debt Maturity in June 2025: A Significant Challenge for Global Financial Markets**\nThe US will face a significant challenge in the global financial market in June 2025, when $580 billion in US debt is set to mature. According to the US Treasury Department, the debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 22%, and the short-term debt ratio will be 20%. The main challenges include market demand weakness, the Federal Reserve's policy restrictions, and the decline in international holdings of US debt. The US will need to issue approximately $80 billion in new debt in 2025, which will be a significant challenge. The interest rate on new debt has risen to 4.5%, which will increase the annual interest burden to $120 billion, or 22% of the federal budget. The US Treasury Department plans to rebuild the General Account (TGA) to $70 billion, which may lead to short-term market tension. If the refinancing is blocked, the off-balance sheet funds holding $80 billion in basis trades may face liquidation risks, further exacerbating market volatility. The dollar system will be impacted, with China and Japan reducing their holdings of US debt. The dollar's global reserve currency status may be weakened, and the dollar index may fall below 100. The global $500 trillion derivatives market may face systemic risks due to margin calls. The US-China trade war will also be affected, with the US considering imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods to offset the budget deficit. However, this may push up inflation to 3.8% and increase consumer burden. China may impose retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural products, which will put pressure on US agricultural states and may force the US to compromise in negotiations. The US may relax tariffs on Chinese consumer goods in exchange for China increasing its holdings of US debt. However, China tends to diversify its asset allocation, and its willingness to increase its holdings of US debt is limited.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: April 23, 2025 02:48 AM\nSource:[std.stheadline.com](https://std.stheadline.com/realtime/article/2065314/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E8%B2%A1%E7%B6%93-6%E6%9C%88%E7%BE%8E%E5%82%B5%E9%9B%86%E4%B8%AD%E5%88%B0%E6%9C%9F-%E5%B0%8D%E9%87%91%E8%9E%8D%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E5%8F%8A%E4%B8%AD%E7%BE%8E%E8%B2%BF%E6%88%B0%E5%BD%B1%E9%9F%BF-%E9%99%B3%E6%96%B0%E7%87%8A)\n\n**The Soft Spot of the US: The Federal Debt Problem**\nThe United States has a soft spot in its federal debt, which has been accumulating over the years. The federal government's net interest expenditure, which is the net amount of interest paid on its debt, reached $489 billion in 2025, accounting for 14% of total federal spending, second only to defense spending. This is equivalent to NT$15.93 trillion, which is more than the total central government budget of Taiwan. Even if the central government of Taiwan were to allocate all its expenditures to pay the interest on the US federal debt for five consecutive years, it would still be insufficient. The severity of the US federal debt can be seen in this. So, why is the US government's interest expenditure so large? The root cause is the continuous accumulation of debt over the years. Although the US federal government has become accustomed to relying on debt to finance its operations, this approach has its limitations. The US federal debt has already exceeded its debt ceiling of $36.1 trillion, and the government is relying on 'extraordinary measures' to operate. However, these measures are limited and will soon be exhausted. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the US federal government will be unable to meet its spending needs by August or September, and the 'X-day' (the day when the US federal government defaults on its debt) will arrive. The CBO warns that if the US federal government's debt requirements exceed expectations, the 'X-day' may arrive as early as May or June. In US history, there has never been a case of federal government debt default. If the 'X-day' arrives, the consequences will be far more severe than the impact of the 'tariff war.' The global financial order will be severely disrupted, and the federal government itself will be unable to operate normally. The only way to resolve this crisis is to raise the debt ceiling again or temporarily suspend it to allow the US Treasury to continue borrowing.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: April 21, 2025 12:03 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6656/8687481)\n\n**When Our $37 Trillion Time Bomb Will Explode**\nThe US national debt is nearing $37 trillion, growing at over $1 trillion every 100 days. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 123%, unsustainable in the long term. Interest payments will exceed $952 billion in fiscal year 2025, surpassing the amount spent on Medicare. President Trump's tax plan would add $7.75 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The 'Bond Vigilantes', a group of institutional investors, are driving up Treasury yields by selling off Treasurys in response to perceived economic bad behavior. China and Japan, the two largest foreign holders of US debt, may be behind the selloff. Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio warns that at some point, the US will have to 'sell a quantity of debt that the world is not going to want to buy.' This could lead to restructurings of debt, pressure from Washington on countries to buy the debt, and even monetization of debt, which risks hyperinflation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 17, 2025 09:28 PM\nSource:[InvestorPlace](https://investorplace.com/2025/04/when-our-37-trillion-time-bomb-will-explode/)\n\n**US Debt Hits Record High, Raising Concerns About Financial Markets and Economic Stability**\nThe US Treasury Department has released the TIC report for February 2025, showing that foreign and regional holdings of US debt have reached a record high of $8.8172 trillion, an increase of $2.217 trillion from the previous month and $8.179 trillion from the previous year. Japan, mainland China, and the UK are the top three foreign holders of US debt, with a combined total of $80.2 billion in February. In contrast, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany reduced their holdings by $2.33 billion, while the UAE entered the top 20 and Mexico dropped out of the rankings. The US federal debt has ballooned to $362 trillion, with approximately $92 trillion set to mature in 2025, accounting for 25.4% of the country's total debt. This has raised concerns about financial markets, interest rates, and economic stability. The record-high government deficit has also driven the rapid accumulation of debt. Since 2020, debt has grown by $13 trillion, with an average annual growth rate of $26 billion over the past five years. In 2024, the US federal deficit was $180 billion, accounting for 6.4% of GDP, with debt interest payments exceeding $1 trillion in the 2024 fiscal year. The $92 trillion in US debt maturing in 2025 accounts for 25.4% of the country's total debt and approximately 31% of the country's 2025 GDP (estimated). By June, nearly $650 billion will need to be refinanced. Much of this debt was issued during a period when interest rates were near zero. As of March 31, the average interest rate on US debt for the 2025 fiscal year was 3.284%, a 4 basis point decrease from the previous year and the second-lowest level since 2010. To meet the demand for maturing debt, the US government will be forced to issue a large amount of new debt, resulting in a higher cost of borrowing. The public holds approximately 89% of the $362 trillion in federal debt, with a total of $289.5 trillion as of October 2024. This represents a ratio of public-held US debt to GDP of over 120% for the year. Analysts predict that US debt interest costs will continue to rise by 1%, with annual debt interest payments exceeding $1 trillion, similar to the 2024 federal deficit of $180 billion.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: April 17, 2025 03:32 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20250417/48223217.html)\n\n**US Public Debt to GDP Ratio to Reach Historic High in 2029, CBO Reports**\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported on March 27 that the ratio of public-held federal debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will rise from 100% in 2025 to 107% in 2029, reaching a historic high. According to the CBO's 'Long-Term Budget Outlook: 2025-2055' report, the ratio of public-held debt to GDP will exceed the post-war historical high in 2029 and continue to grow. By 2055, the ratio will reach 156%, and will continue to grow. The report also predicts that the federal government's budget deficit will remain at a historic high over the next 30 years, reaching 7.3% of GDP by 2055. As of the latest data from the US Department of the Treasury, the US national debt has exceeded $36.2 trillion, with public-held debt exceeding $28.9 trillion. 'The ratio of public-held debt to GDP will reach a historic high in 2029,' said the CBO report.

The US budget deficit as a percentage of GDP is expected to remain above 6% until 2026. The dollar's global reserve currency status will allow the US to maintain a high degree of flexibility in public finance. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated his 3-3-3 economic policy: reducing the budget deficit to 3% of GDP, increasing oil production by 300,000 barrels per day, and maintaining a 3% economic growth rate. However, Bessent stated that discussing increasing the proportion of long-term government bonds is premature due to high inflation and the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening plan. Data from the FRED website shows that the US federal interest expenditure as a percentage of GDP jumped from 2.37794 in 2023 to 3.02103 in 2024, the highest since 1995. The US budget deficit for the first four months of the 2025 fiscal year (October 2024 to January 2025) increased by 58% to $83.958 billion, a record high for the same period. Peter Morici, an economist from the University of Maryland, wrote in MarketWatch that the US public sector's debt, business investment, and new housing starts have exceeded US corporate and household savings. The US is selling US bonds to foreign investors and attracting large investments in the AI field through its dollar's global reserve currency status and AI capabilities. Morici stated that if the US is isolated due to a trade war, its economic growth will slow down.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=239e7f3d-7737-41d0-a322-d280c2611855)\n\n**DOGE can't really help the US dodge its debt overload problem**\nThe US federal budget for 2025 is expected to be around $7 trillion, with a deficit of about $2 trillion. The national debt has reached 125% of the country's GDP, exceeding its post-World War II high. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) aims to eliminate waste and fraud, cutting the deficit in half, but its efforts are unlikely to make a significant impact. The tracker website, Doge-tracker.com, shows $55 billion in savings in one month, but this is a small fraction of the overall budget. The US Constitution gives Congress the power to create a federal budget, and mandatory programmes, such as Medicare and Social Security, account for over two-thirds of the annual budget. DOGE's goal of slashing $1 trillion in expenditure cuts is unlikely to be met, and the US national debt will continue to increase as a proportion of GDP, posing a risk to the country's long-term credit rating and bond market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 10:32 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/doge-can-t-really-help-the-us-dodge-its-debt-overload-problem-11740152210205.html)\n\n**Dodging Debt!**\nThe US government's debt continues to pile up, with a $1.9 trillion deficit forecast for 2025, rising to $2.7 trillion by 2035. The debt-to-GDP ratio is set to swell from 122% to 150% or higher by the next decade. The new Treasury Secretary acknowledges that the US has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. However, cutting spending would devastate an economy addicted to debt-fueled excess. The US has already breached 'Fergusson's Law', spending more on debt interest than on defense. By 2049, the US will be spending two times as much on interest payments than on defense spending, a unsustainable path. The ultimate endgame for the US Treasury Secretary will be to inflate the debt away, rather than risk a direct default. Foreign holders of US Treasury debt are unlikely to continue buying or holding their bonds, as the trend of ditching treasuries for hedge funds in fiscal paradises is set to accelerate over the next four years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 11:37 AM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2025-02-22/dodging-debt)\n\n**US Debt Crisis Looms in 2025: $9.2 Trillion of Debt Matures, Putting Pressure on Financial Markets**\nThe United States' national debt of $36.2 trillion will reach a critical point in 2025, with $9.2 trillion of debt maturing, representing 25.4% of the country's total debt. This has raised concerns about its implications on financial markets, interest rates, and economic stability. The rapid accumulation of debt has been driven by historically high levels of deficit spending, with a $13 trillion increase since 2020, averaging $2.6 trillion annually over the past five years. The federal deficit for 2024 is $1.8 trillion, equivalent to 6.4% of GDP, and interest payments on the debt have increased to over $1 trillion annually. The situation is alarming, with 70% of the maturing debt, or $6.5 trillion, due between January and June 2025, putting significant pressure on bond markets. The government will be forced to issue a large amount of new bonds to meet these maturities, increasing the supply of Treasury bonds and potentially driving up yields. The market has already shown signs of tension, with real yields increasing steadily since 2022. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen 115 basis points since the start of rate cuts, reflecting investors' growing concern about the government's increasing debt. As The Kobeissi Letter noted on February 4, 'the problem of US debt is not new, but the magnitude of the refinancing challenge in 2025 makes it a topic that investors cannot ignore.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[bitfinanzas.com](https://bitfinanzas.com/la-deuda-de-ee-uu-de-92-billones-de-dolares-vencera-en-2025/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All seven experts assign an extremely high probability (98-99%) that the US national debt will exceed $37 trillion on June 27, 2025. Across diverse perspectives\u2014public finance, debt sustainability analysis, US government budget analysis, Keynesian and neoclassical macroeconomics, and political science theories\u2014there is strong consensus about continued increases in national debt, driven primarily by persistent structural deficits, rising interest costs, and ongoing political inertia. Current data put the debt at or just below $37T in early June 2025, with monthly increments from ongoing deficits making it virtually certain to surpass the threshold by late June. The rare scenarios that could produce a 'No' (such as a sudden, extreme bipartisan fiscal turnaround, highly disruptive and unprecedented government shutdown, or temporary technical/accounting adjustments) are viewed as extremely unlikely within the three-week window to resolution. Debt ceiling impasses are acknowledged but are either not projected to become binding until after the resolution date or, based on precedent, are expected to be resolved without causing a drop in the reported debt level. Thus, the expert consensus strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome, citing both the current trajectory and the absence of credible mechanisms for a reduction or pause in debt accumulation before the deadline."
