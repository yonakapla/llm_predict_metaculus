(2) You talk about the lack of 'strong signals from rivals,' but miss several indicators: ongoing incremental updates from Google (Gemma 3 family ramping up), xAI's Grok surges, and the compressed timeline that makes the entire leaderboard more stochastic than ever.

Yes, the performance gap is thin, and manipulation is plausible, but unless there\u2019s a *clear*, pre-announced new model drop, the lessons of digital platform competition say OpenAI is the comfortable default.

Your assertion that Meta faces 'internal disorganization/delayed releases' ignores the strategic use of last-week launches to capture attention, a playbook all the big labs have run (including OpenAI). You can't treat leaderboard outcomes as a macro business trend where the dominant player slowly loses ground over years; this is more like a Formula 1 race in the rain, with the lead changing lap to lap.

Traditional search engines like Google and Bing are being updated to incorporate generative AI technology and their own more user-friendly chatbots. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI in 2015, has become the dominant player in the chatbot market, with an 80% market share, according to Statcounter. Other players have emerged, including Perplexity, Claude, and Deepseek. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Meta have also launched their own chatbots, such as Copilot, Gemini, and Llama. These systems use advanced models to generate coherent and contextually relevant content, such as text, images, music, or code. They are capable of solving problems and interacting with users in a similar way to humans. The incorporation of generative AI technology is adding a conversational interface to search engines, allowing users to ask questions and receive personalized and contextualized responses. The search process is now more like a conversation, with users able to ask follow-up questions and provide additional information to train the algorithm. The advantage of search with generative AI is that it uses real-time data, combining pre-trained models with information from the web to improve the accuracy of responses. This technique, called retrieval-augmented generation, reduces errors and allows the system to learn from user feedback and adapt to different contexts. The shift to native AI search is changing the rules of the game for search engine optimization (SEO), with the emergence of generative SEO (GEO). The goal is now to appear directly in the selected response, rather than on a traditional search engine results page (SERP). This phenomenon is known as 'response as destination', where the user receives the generated information directly, without the need to click on external links or leave the search engine. The response itself becomes the final destination of the search, reducing the dependence on traditional SERPs. This change will transform how visibility and reputation are evaluated, with a greater influence from the algorithm than public perception. New platforms are emerging that optimize generative models with brand linguistic patterns, injecting high-impact SEO keywords and executing large volumes of synthetic searches generated by AI. However, this also raises risks of distortion, language bias, and forced keyword injection.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 14, 2025 10:39 PM\nSource:[EL MUNDO](https://www.elmundo.es/economia/macroeconomia/2025/06/15/684b0f20e4d4d8f17f8b458e.html)\n\n**Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blame**\nA recent poll by Bloomberg Intelligence found that most consumers don't want to pay to chat with a chatbot, with only 25% of users willing to pay up to $20 for a monthly subscription. This means that advertising will be the route to monetizing large language models. OpenAI, the leader in the market, has over 600 million weekly active users, but only 20 million users subscribe to paid plans, with a low-single-digit rate of adoption for the pay tier. The company is expected to pivot to ads, with a second-half 2025 launch imminent. However, OpenAI faces a difficult situation, as developing LLMs requires expensive data center infrastructure, making it economical for Google to monetize free search via ads. Google's search business is likely to benefit from the AI effect, with AI-generated previews reducing click-through rates but driving up average cost-per-click of ads for ad buyers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 13, 2025 06:05 PM\nSource:[ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-ads-are-coming-to-your-favorite-ai-bots-and-youve-only-got-yourself-to-blame/)\n\n**OpenAI to Continue Collaboration with Scale AI Despite Meta's Ac**\nOpenAI's CFO, Sarah Friar, announced plans to continue collaboration with Scale AI, despite Meta's acquisition of a 49% stake in the AI startup for $14.8 billion. Friar emphasized the importance of keeping the ecosystem open to foster innovation, stating that OpenAI sources data from multiple vendors and requires expert knowledge as AI models become more sophisticated.

Traditional search engines like Google and Bing are being updated to incorporate generative AI technology and their own more user-friendly chatbots. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI in 2015, has become the dominant player in the chatbot market, with an 80% market share, according to Statcounter. Other players have emerged, including Perplexity, Claude, and Deepseek. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Meta have also launched their own chatbots, such as Copilot, Gemini, and Llama. These systems use advanced models to generate coherent and contextually relevant content, such as text, images, music, or code. They are capable of solving problems and interacting with users in a similar way to humans. The incorporation of generative AI technology is adding a conversational interface to search engines, allowing users to ask questions and receive personalized and contextualized responses. The search process is now more like a conversation, with users able to ask follow-up questions and provide additional information to train the algorithm. The advantage of search with generative AI is that it uses real-time data, combining pre-trained models with information from the web to improve the accuracy of responses. This technique, called retrieval-augmented generation, reduces errors and allows the system to learn from user feedback and adapt to different contexts. The shift to native AI search is changing the rules of the game for search engine optimization (SEO), with the emergence of generative SEO (GEO). The goal is now to appear directly in the selected response, rather than on a traditional search engine results page (SERP). This phenomenon is known as 'response as destination', where the user receives the generated information directly, without the need to click on external links or leave the search engine. The response itself becomes the final destination of the search, reducing the dependence on traditional SERPs. This change will transform how visibility and reputation are evaluated, with a greater influence from the algorithm than public perception. New platforms are emerging that optimize generative models with brand linguistic patterns, injecting high-impact SEO keywords and executing large volumes of synthetic searches generated by AI. However, this also raises risks of distortion, language bias, and forced keyword injection.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 14, 2025 10:39 PM\nSource:[EL MUNDO](https://www.elmundo.es/economia/macroeconomia/2025/06/15/684b0f20e4d4d8f17f8b458e.html)\n\n**OpenAI's Plan to Revolutionize Higher Education with AI**\nOpenAI has partnered with the California State University to bring ChatGPT to 460,000 students. The company aims to reformulate higher education by incorporating its AI tools into all aspects of university life. The plan is to provide students with AI assistants to guide and teach them from orientation to graduation. Professors will provide customized AI study bots for each class, and career services will offer chatbots for students to practice job interviews. The OpenAI is selling premium AI services to universities for use by professors and students. The company is also running marketing campaigns to encourage students who have never used chatbots to try ChatGPT. Some universities, including the University of Maryland and the University of California, are already working to make AI tools a part of students' daily experience. The OpenAI's initiative is part of a growing competition among tech giants to conquer universities and students with their chatbots. The company is following the steps of rivals like Google and Microsoft, which have been trying to bring their computers and software to schools and win over students as future customers. The competition is so intense that Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, and Elon Musk, who founded the rival xAI, have published rival ads on social media this year, offering free premium AI services to university students during exam periods. Google has increased its bet, announcing free access to its premium chatbot service for students until their final exams in 2026. OpenAI has started the recent trend of AI education. In late 2022, the launch of ChatGPT by the company, which can produce essays and academic papers with human-like speech, helped trigger a wave of AI-powered cheating. AI generative tools like ChatGPT, trained on large databases of text, can also invent things, which can deceive students. Less than three years later, millions of university students use AI chatbots regularly as research assistants, writing tools, computer programming tools, and idea generators. Now, OpenAI is taking advantage of the popularity of ChatGPT to promote the company's AI services for universities as the new infrastructure for higher education. The OpenAI's service for universities, ChatGPT Edu, offers more resources, including certain privacy protections, than the company's free chatbot. ChatGPT Edu also allows professors and staff to create customized chatbots for university use. OpenAI offers premium versions of its chatbot for a monthly fee. The OpenAI's initiative to make higher education more AI-based is equivalent to a national experiment with millions of students. The use of these chatbots in schools is so new that their potential long-term educational benefits and possible side effects have not yet been established. Some universities claim they are adopting the new AI tools partly because they want their institutions to help guide and develop protections for the technologies. The OpenAI is following a dual strategy: commercializing its premium services for universities for a fee and, at the same time, announcing ChatGPT for free directly to students. The company has also recently gathered a panel of university students to help their peers start using the technology. Among these students are advanced users like Delphine Tai-Beauchamp, a computer science student at the University of California, Irvine. She used the chatbot to explain complex course concepts, as well as to help explain coding errors and create diagrams illustrating the connections between ideas. 'I wouldn't recommend that students use AI to avoid the hard parts of learning,' Tai-Beauchamp said. She recommended that students experiment with AI as a study aid. 'Ask it to explain something five different ways.' Belsky said that this type of suggestion helped the company create its first advertising campaign targeted at university students. 'Can you test me on the muscles of the leg?' asked a ChatGPT billboard published in Chicago. 'Give me a guide to mastering this calculus 101 program,' said another. Belsky said that OpenAI has also started funding research on the educational effects of its chatbots. 'The challenge is: how do you really identify which AI uses in the university are the most impactful?' Belsky said during an AI event in December at Cornell Tech in New York. 'And then, how do you replicate those best practices throughout the ecosystem?' Some faculty members have already created customized chatbots for their students, sending course materials such as notes, slides, videos, and quizzes to ChatGPT. Jared DeForest, president of the department of environmental and plant biology at Ohio University, created his own tutoring bot, called SoilSage, which can answer student questions based on his published research articles and scientific knowledge. Limiting the chatbot to reliable sources of information improved its accuracy, he said. 'The curated chatbot allows me to control the information contained in it to get the product I want at the university level,' said Professor DeForest. But even when trained with specific course materials, AI can make mistakes. In a new study -- 'Can AI have office hours?' -- professors at law schools loaded a book of patent law cases into OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models. They then asked dozens of questions about patent law based on the book of cases and discovered that all three AI chatbots made 'significant' legal errors that could be 'harmful to learning.' 'This is a good way to divert students from the right path,' said Jonathan S. Masur, a law professor at the University of Chicago and co-author of the study. 'So, I think everyone needs to take a deep breath and slow down a bit.' OpenAI said that the 250,000-word book of cases used in the study was more than twice the size of the text that its GPT-4 model can process at once. Anthropic said that the study had limited utility because it did not compare AI with human performance. Google said that the accuracy of its model had improved since the study was conducted. Belsky said that a new 'memory' feature, which retains and can consult previous interactions with a user, would help ChatGPT adapt its responses to students over time and make the AI 'more valuable as you grow and learn.' Experts in privacy warn that this type of tracking feature raises concerns about long-term surveillance by technology companies. Just as many students today convert their school-provided Gmail accounts to personal accounts when they graduate, Belsky imagines students graduating taking their AI chatbots with them to their workplaces and using them for the rest of their lives. 'It would be the gateway to learning -- and to a professional life from there,' said Belsky.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 14, 2025 08:42 PM\nSource:[Estad\u00e3o](https://www.estadao.com.br/link/empresas/nova-aposta-da-openai-e-fazer-o-chatgpt-ser-indispensavel-nas-universidades-entenda/)\n\n**OpenAI to Continue Working with Scale AI Despite Meta Acquisition**\nOpenAI plans to continue working with Scale AI despite its agreement with Meta to acquire a 49% stake in the AI startup for $14.8 billion.

This means that advertising will be the route to monetizing large language models. OpenAI, the leader in the market, has over 600 million weekly active users, but only 20 million users subscribe to paid plans, with a low-single-digit rate of adoption for the pay tier. The company is expected to pivot to ads, with a second-half 2025 launch imminent. However, OpenAI faces a difficult situation, as developing LLMs requires expensive data center infrastructure, making it economical for Google to monetize free search via ads. Google's search business is likely to benefit from the AI effect, with AI-generated previews reducing click-through rates but driving up average cost-per-click of ads for ad buyers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 13, 2025 06:05 PM\nSource:[ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-ads-are-coming-to-your-favorite-ai-bots-and-youve-only-got-yourself-to-blame/)\n\n**OpenAI to Continue Collaboration with Scale AI Despite Meta's Ac**\nOpenAI's CFO, Sarah Friar, announced plans to continue collaboration with Scale AI, despite Meta's acquisition of a 49% stake in the AI startup for $14.8 billion.

Researchers have expressed concern that these AI models, designed to be helpful, can be detrimental to users who lack judgment. In South Korea, digital counseling services, where users can seek advice on creation-type AI, have become increasingly popular, leading to calls for improvement in AI settings. A recent study by Google DeepMind found that AI chatbots gave dangerous advice to a simulated user who was seeking help for drug addiction. In the US, a woman sued a company for its chatbot's role in encouraging her 14-year-old son to commit suicide. Tech giants such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta are releasing new AI products, including updates to their chatbots to make them more user-friendly. However, OpenAI's GPT-4o update was criticized for being too positive, and the company eventually withdrew the update. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, apologized for the update, saying it made the chatbot 'too flattering and insincere.' Experts warn that the trend of users interacting with AI chatbots will continue to grow, and that safety measures need to be put in place to minimize the negative effects of overly friendly AI.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 13, 2025 08:20 AM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2025/06/13/D7UA35POPBHBBB6JQTXUX4MPAI/)\n\n**New Relic Report Shows OpenAI's ChatGPT Dominates Among AI Developers**\nNew Relic's AI Unwrapped: 2025 AI Impact Report reveals that OpenAI's ChatGPT dominates among AI developers, accounting for over 86% of all LLM tokens processed by New Relic customers.

According to the study, these companies can test multiple private models before releasing them to the public, and then only release the best-performing model to the public. This can lead to a biased ranking system, where average-performing models are ranked higher than they should be. The researchers also found that proprietary models, which do not disclose their neural network parameters, have an advantage over open-weight models and open-source models in terms of the number of prompts they receive. This can lead to a situation where AI developers can adjust their models using previous data and achieve high scores in the next month.

The poor performance is attributed to the model not being 'optimized for conversationality,' unlike the experimental version, 'Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental,' which was tailored for conversationality and performed well on LM Arena. A Meta spokesperson stated, 'Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental' is a chat optimized version we experimented with that also performs well on LMArena.' The company has released its open-source version and is excited to see how developers customize it for their use cases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 11, 2025 10:46 PM\nSource:[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/metas-vanilla-maverick-ai-model-ranks-below-rivals-on-a-popular-chat-benchmark/)\n\n**The AI model race has suddenly gotten a lot closer, say Stanford scholars**\nThe competition to create the world's top artificial intelligence models has become increasingly competitive, with a narrowing gap between the best and the weakest models. According to Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, the Elo score difference between the top and 10th-ranked model on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard narrowed from 11.9% in 2024 to 5.4% in early 2025. The gap between OpenAI and Google has also narrowed, with the GPT family and Gemini having a performance difference of just 0.7%. Additionally, the rise of 'open-weight' AI models, such as Meta Platforms's Llama, has made it possible for them to equal the top 'closed' models, such as GPT. The authors note that creating benchmarks is not simple and that standardizing across benchmarks is essential going forward to ensure reliable AI evaluation and prevent misleading conclusions about model performance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 03:32 PM\nSource:[ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ai-model-race-has-suddenly-gotten-a-lot-closer-say-stanford-scholars/)\n\n**Google Introduces Lightweight Gemma 3 Series Models for Easier AI Development**\nGoogle has announced the next-generation lightweight open-source Gemma large language model series, designed to be more accessible and easier to use. The new Gemma 3 series models offer various scale options, ranging from 1 billion to 27 billion parameters, allowing developers to choose the best model based on hardware and performance requirements. The Gemma 3 series shares the same underlying technology as Google's most complex and powerful Gemini model, which powers the Gemini AI chatbot (formerly Bard). According to Google, the Gemma 3 series can provide high performance at its scale, outperforming larger models like Llama-405B, DeepSeek-V3, and OpenAI's o3-mini in preliminary human preference evaluations on the LMArena leaderboard. Even when running on a single device or GPU, Gemma 3 can provide sufficient performance to create AI applications with multi-modal capabilities, supporting advanced text and visual reasoning. The model has a 128,000-token context window, allowing it to process approximately 30 high-resolution images, a 300-page book, or over an hour of video, comparable to OpenAI's GPT-4o context length. Google also released ShieldGemma 2, a variant with 40 billion parameters, designed to check image security and label it as safe or dangerous. ShieldGemma enables developers to build applications that can detect potential dangers in uploaded images, outputting safety labels in three categories: 'dangerous content', 'pornographic content', and 'violence'. Developers can further adjust the model according to their needs by providing the content to be monitored and labeled.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 02:42 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/relnews/us/2025-03-14/doc-inepqsvs4053927.shtml)\n\n**Google Releases Gemma 3 Series of Models, a Single-GPU Model with High Performance**\nGoogle has released the Gemma 3 series of models, which are the most advanced, portable, and responsible open-source models developed by Google.

    "summary": "Experts broadly agree that OpenAI is moderately to strongly favored to be ranked #1 overall (including ties) on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q2 2025, but not with overwhelming certainty. The dominant reasons supporting this forecast are OpenAI's historical incumbency, rapid and strategic model iteration (such as GPT-4o and possible late updates), strong network effects, and brand/user familiarity, all of which boost its position on human-preference-driven leaderboards. Many experts note credible allegations of leaderboard manipulation or optimization by major labs (including OpenAI) exploiting private testing and selective release procedures, further stacking the odds in OpenAI's favor. Advantageous resolution criteria\u2014that ties count\u2014also tip the balance toward a 'Yes'.\n\nHowever, all experts stress that the gap between top models has compressed dramatically, now often less than 1% Elo difference, creating volatility; any late-breaking release from strong competitors such as Google (Gemini), xAI (Grok), Meta (Llama/Behemoth), or rising open-source Chinese models (DeepSeek, Qwen) could flip the leaderboard in the final days. The pace of technical leapfrogging and increased I/O evaluation diversity make upsets increasingly plausible, especially if a rival times a headline-grabbing release before July 1st. Some experts also caution that growing controversies or user fatigue with OpenAI could, in rare scenarios, erode its status.\n\nScenario descriptions consistently imagine the 'No' case as stemming from a competitor's late technical breakthrough or surge in user voting, while the 'Yes' case typically involves OpenAI leveraging its resource advantages, user base, and possibly incremental updates, or simply holding steady in the absence of dramatic disruption.\n\nAcross disciplines\u2014ML/benchmarking, product/roadmap analysis, business strategy, industry/China analysis, transformer AI architecture, and sociotechnical systems\u2014the final probabilities span a moderately tight range, from about 62% (cautious) to 85% (confident); most cluster in the 67\u201378% band, with an average in the low-to-mid 70s. All agree that OpenAI remains the likeliest, but the days of near-certainty are over, given how leader churn, model parity, and competitive intensity have increased markedly in 2025."
