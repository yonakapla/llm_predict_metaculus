Nonetheless, the proximity to zero means a positive outcome isn't implausible; even a minor revision could tip Q1 positive.

The initial and second estimates have converged around a small contraction (-0.3% to -0.2%), with the contraction attributed to a mix of supply and demand-side issues: a large pre-tariff import surge, poor private consumption, and a sharp government spending decline. Final sales were down and corporate profits fell, suggesting economy-wide weakness beyond the inventory build. While measurement and data volatility means that small positive or zero readings are within the margin of error, there is no news of major late-breaking data that would lift GDP above zero; instead, risks seem stacked to the downside given persistent headwinds in consumer and government spending and a high inventory drawdown risk. Given the base rate of revisions flipping sign at this late stage is low (roughly 10% in recent decades for small contractions), I judge the prospect of the Q1 2025 third estimate showing positive growth to be unlikely, but non-negligible, and set probability accordingly.",

According to the Forum's conjuncture note, 'the deterioration of external perspectives and the slowdown of private consumption, in addition to the very weak result of the first quarter, reinforce our expectation of a growth below 2% in 2025.' The Forum had previously estimated a downward revision of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for this year to values below 2%. The reduction of interest rates is expected to have a limited impact on investment, which is affected by 'weak expectations' of increased demand and high uncertainty. The difficulties in implementing the Recovery and Resilience Plan (PRR) are also a concern, with the expectation of its acceleration 'many times announced.' The deterioration of international perspectives is due to tariffs and their uncertainty, which paralyzes investment, hiring, and large purchases decisions. 'What seems more certain is that the ECB [European Central Bank] will continue to decrease its interest rates, one of the few positive aspects of the current situation, although we are getting closer to the end of these monetary stimuli,' pointed out. The ECB is expected to decide on a new 25 basis point cut in interest rates on Thursday, in a context still marked by commercial tensions and predictions of weak economic growth in the euro zone. The Forum also believes that the election result 'seems to guarantee some political stability in the short term,' highlighting that the main doubts are related to the Government's ability to approve the reforms that the economy needs.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 03:21 PM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/06/04/forum-para-a-competitividade-mantem-perspetiva-de-crescimento-abaixo-de-2/)\n\n**Australian Economy Experiences Slower-Than-Expected Growth in First Quarter**\nThe Australian economy experienced a slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025, according to data from the Bureau of Statistics. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 1.3% year-over-year, below the expected 1.5% but in line with the previous quarter's growth of 1.3%. However, the GDP grew by only 0.2% quarter-over-quarter, lower than the expected 0.4% and a slowdown from the 0.6% growth in the previous quarter. The weakness in government spending and the negative impacts of weather conditions, including cyclones and bushfires, have weighed on the growth. The weather conditions have particularly affected the mining, tourism, and maritime sectors. The government spending has remained largely stable, while household spending has increased at a slower pace than in the previous quarter. The disappointing results were partly anticipated by the mediocre data on the current account balance and net export contribution released on Tuesday. The Australian businesses have also reported lower operating profits during the quarter. The country's exports of raw materials have been affected by the new trade war between the US and China, one of its main export destinations. A de-escalation of the trade war in May could contribute to a better second quarter for the Australian economy. Although the Australian economy is still expected to grow this year, the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned that the growth will likely slow down, citing uncertainty about global trade.

According to the Forum's conjuncture note, 'the deterioration of external perspectives and the slowdown of private consumption, in addition to the very weak result of the first quarter, reinforce our expectation of a growth below 2% in 2025.' The Forum had previously estimated a downward revision of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for this year to values below 2%. The reduction of interest rates is expected to have a limited impact on investment, which is affected by 'weak expectations' of increased demand and high uncertainty. The difficulties in implementing the Recovery and Resilience Plan (PRR) are also a concern, with the expectation of its acceleration 'many times announced.' The deterioration of international perspectives is due to tariffs and their uncertainty, which paralyzes investment, hiring, and large purchases decisions. 'What seems more certain is that the ECB [European Central Bank] will continue to decrease its interest rates, one of the few positive aspects of the current situation, although we are getting closer to the end of these monetary stimuli,' pointed out. The ECB is expected to decide on a new 25 basis point cut in interest rates on Thursday, in a context still marked by commercial tensions and predictions of weak economic growth in the euro zone. The Forum also believes that the election result 'seems to guarantee some political stability in the short term,' highlighting that the main doubts are related to the Government's ability to approve the reforms that the economy needs.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 03:21 PM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/06/04/forum-para-a-competitividade-mantem-perspetiva-de-crescimento-abaixo-de-2/)\n\n**Australian Economy Experiences Slower-Than-Expected Growth in First Quarter**\nThe Australian economy experienced a slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025, according to data from the Bureau of Statistics. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 1.3% year-over-year, below the expected 1.5% but in line with the previous quarter's growth of 1.3%. However, the GDP grew by only 0.2% quarter-over-quarter, lower than the expected 0.4% and a slowdown from the 0.6% growth in the previous quarter. The weakness in government spending and the negative impacts of weather conditions, including cyclones and bushfires, have weighed on the growth. The weather conditions have particularly affected the mining, tourism, and maritime sectors. The government spending has remained largely stable, while household spending has increased at a slower pace than in the previous quarter. The disappointing results were partly anticipated by the mediocre data on the current account balance and net export contribution released on Tuesday. The Australian businesses have also reported lower operating profits during the quarter. The country's exports of raw materials have been affected by the new trade war between the US and China, one of its main export destinations. A de-escalation of the trade war in May could contribute to a better second quarter for the Australian economy. Although the Australian economy is still expected to grow this year, the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned that the growth will likely slow down, citing uncertainty about global trade. However, a slowdown in the economy gives the RBA more reasons to cut interest rates further, after having lowered them by a total of 50 basis points so far in 2025.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 01:44 AM\nSource:[Investing.com France](https://fr.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/le-pib-australien-au-premier-trimestre-croit-moins-que-prevu-en-raison-du-commerce-et-des-depenses-faibles-2908658)\n\n**The Atlanta Fed Just Gave Trump More Good News**\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has released new projections for economic growth, predicting a 4.6% increase in real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025.

The rebound was reflected in an annualized growth of 18% in that quarter, followed by a rise above 5% in the fourth quarter. In the fiscal area, the government achieved a financial surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2024 and maintains its commitment to achieving a primary surplus in 2025. The monetary policy also changed, with the elimination of monetary emission and the adoption of a currency band regime that contemplates a monthly depreciation of 1%. The OECD projects an inflation rate of 36.6% for 2025, above the 29% previously estimated, but considers that the disinflation process will continue. For 2026, it expects a price increase of 14.9%, still high compared to the G20 average. The OECD also expects fixed investment to grow by 21.7% in 2025 and 14.9% in 2026, while exports will increase by 11.2% next year and 6.4% the following year. Imports will also rise, reflecting a recovery of purchasing power and a decrease in state intervention in trade. Despite the optimism, the OECD warns about certain structural challenges pending: a real exchange rate that could affect external competitiveness, the need to expand the tax base, reduce subsidies and fiscal distortions, and advance in a greater opening of the services sector. Finally, the report notes that the improvement in the business climate, the recovery of private sector credit, and the increased confidence of consumers mark a path of recovery that, although uncertain, shows positive signs in the medium term.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[diariohuarpe.com](https://diariohuarpe.com/nota/segun-ocde-argentina-crecera-5-2-en-2025-y-sera-la-segunda-del-g20-20256313410)\n\n**Breakfast briefing: More stagnation everywhere, more inflation in the US**\nThe US is experiencing stagflation, with the USD falling to a three-year low, gold rising, and US benchmark interest rates increasing. The week ahead will feature central bank rate decisions from Canada, the ECB, and India. The US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show a +130,000 increase, but the trend is 'ho-hum'. Factory and service sector PMIs will be closely watched for the consequences of trade war activity. The US has doubled steel tariffs, making its steel industry less competitive globally and embedding higher producer costs for American factories and higher prices for its customers. China's official PMIs show a contraction in the factory version, but a tiny expansion in services. Inflation pressures aren't evident in China, and Beijing has resisted Trump's request for a phone call with Xi. Other countries' PMIs show little change, but the trade war seems to be embedding stagnation. Inflation doesn't seem to be a problem, except in the US. Central banks in other countries can try a rate cut remedy, but this remedy is not available to the Americans. China is applying both monetary and fiscal policies to stabilise their situation. India reported a +7.4% expansion in Q1-2025 GDP, led by the construction sector and consumer spending. Canada also reported an expanding economy in Q1-2025, gaining +0.5% in the quarter. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey recovered its early month drop, but the level is very pessimistic. Job ad growth in Australia has turned into a decline, and the regulator ASIC found widespread compliance deficiencies in managed funds plans.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in the first quarter of 2025 decreased by 0.2% compared to the previous year. This is a significant and worrying decline, especially considering that the GDP in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased by 2.4%. Experts from the Bureau of Economic Analysis explained that the decline in real GDP in the first quarter in the US was mainly due to the increase in imports (subtracted when calculating GDP) and the decrease in government spending. 'The real GDP was revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point compared to the initial estimate, which is a reflection of the correction of investment data and partially offset by the correction of consumer spending' - informed the BEA. Analysts from PKO BP noted that the weak start to 2025 is primarily due to the deepening trade deficit in the US before the introduction of tariffs by the administration of Donald Trump. They reminded that the announcement of the introduction of high tariffs led to an increase in imports to the US (companies and traders made stockpiles) which clearly affected the increase in the trade deficit. Additionally, the latest FOMC protocol does not lack warnings about the threat of inflation and potential deterioration of growth forecasts. The OECD also recently lowered its forecasts for global economic prospects due to Donald Trump's trade policy. The organization predicts that global GDP growth will slow down from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025 and 3% in 2026. Earlier, it was assumed that both in 2025 and 2026, global GDP would grow by 3.3%.

The central bank estimated that the 'modal implied path based on option prices (...) decreased slightly during the period and was consistent with one or two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of the year, slightly more than in the March meeting'. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body responsible for determining US monetary policy, left interest rates at their current range of 4.25-4.5% after its meeting on May 6 and 7, its third meeting of the year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted that while it is 'likely' that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and higher unemployment if they continue, the economy remains solid for now. The minutes added that 'tariff announcements caused a significant deterioration in global risk perception, which largely reversed after a subsequent pause in the application of some tariffs and growing investor optimism about a decrease in trade tensions'. The publication comes a day before the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) releases its first revision of the first-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to data released in late April, the GDP contracted 0.3% at an annualized rate from January to March, marking the first quarterly negative data since 2022. The Fed noted that the technical staff's projection of real GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 was weaker than in the March meeting, as announced trade policies implied a greater drag on activity. It was also expected that trade policies would lead to slower productivity growth and, therefore, reduce potential growth in the coming years. Participants in the central bank's meeting agreed that there is a possibility that inflation will be more persistent than expected, but also that the institution is well-positioned to make decisions without haste, awaiting 'greater clarity' on both price increases and economic activity.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 07:31 PM\nSource:[Forbes M\u00e9xico](https://forbes.com.mx/la-fed-preve-uno-o-dos-recortes-de-tasas-de-aqui-a-final-de-ano/)\n\n**Charted: America's GDP Decline in Q1 2025**\nThe US economy is showing signs of weakness as Q1 2025 real GDP declined by -0.3%, the first negative quarter since Q1 2022.

The real GDP of the United States decreased by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, mainly due to an increase in imports and lower government spending. In contrast, the real GDP increased by 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The BEA report also shows that the inflationary pressure remains at a high level, with the index of prices for total domestic purchases increasing by 3.4% in the first quarter, compared to 2.2% in the previous quarter.

In the first quarter of 2025, the annualized GDP growth rate was negative, and the preferred inflation measure by the Fed has increased significantly. The initial estimate of the GDP growth rate for the first quarter of 2025, published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), showed a decline of 0.3% in annualized terms. This result was different from the expectations of economists, who had expected a low reading and a clear decline compared to the previous quarter, but still expected a growth of 0.3%. The published reading is the worst result since the first quarter of 2022. The Americans present the GDP dynamics differently than the Europeans. They annualize short-term data, i.e., they convert it into annual data. In short, the monthly value is multiplied by 12, and the quarterly value by 4. The Fed's model from Atlanta also signaled a slowdown in the US economy. Its forecast, updated weekly, initially predicted a growth of over 2% in annualized terms, but from March, it began to indicate that the US economy would contract in the first quarter by nearly 3%. In the latest update on April 27, it predicted a decline of 2.7%. The economists also expected a weaker result due to the observed trend of building inventories and increased imports to the US before expected changes in trade policy. The 'Day of Liberation', when Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs, took place on April 2. The publication follows the Fed meeting on March 18-19, at which the decision-makers presented mixed perspectives on economic projections for the US. The GDP growth rate forecast for this year was significantly revised downward to 1.7% (from 2.1% expected in December). The mid-week data are one of the most important quarterly readings before the planned meeting of the Fed on May 6-7, as they include new data on inflation, according to the preferred measure of the Federal Reserve, PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures). However, the statistics were not good, as the PCE measure in the first quarter jumped to 3.5% from 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024. It was also higher than the forecast, which expected a 3.3% increase in prices. The report also included the GDP deflator, which measures the inflation of all domestic goods and services, including exports, but excluding imports. It was expected to increase to 3.1% compared to 2.3% in the last three months of 2024. The actual result was also significantly higher and reached 3.7%.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: April 30, 2025 12:53 PM\nSource:[Bankier.pl](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/USA-przegrywaja-przez-polityke-Trumpa-Fatalne-dane-z-najwiekszej-gospodarki-swiata-8934090.html)\n\n**Fourth quarter 2024 U.S. GDP revised up to annual rate of 2.4%**\nThe U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was revised up to an annual rate of 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The increase in real GDP was primarily driven by increases in consumer spending and government spending, which were partly offset by a decrease in investment. Private goods-producing industries saw a 2.3% increase, while private services-producing industries saw a 2.4% increase. Corporate profits also increased by $204.7 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to a decrease of $15.0 billion in the third quarter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 27, 2025 02:12 PM\nSource:[Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article302918184.html)\n\n**US Economy Expands at Faster Rate Than Estimated in Fourth Quarter**\nThe US economy expanded at a faster rate than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, driven by upward revisions in net exports, government spending, and business investment. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annualized rate of 2.4% in the period from October to December, according to the third revision of the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released on Thursday. The previous estimate was 2.3%. Consumer spending growth, which accounts for two-thirds of GDP, was revised downward to 4%. The US GDP grew 2.8% in 2024, according to the third estimate and final data released on Thursday by the BEA. In comparison to the previous quarter, GDP growth was 0.6%, and for the year 2024, the US economy expanded 2.8% compared to 2023, below the 2.9% growth rate of the previous year, thanks to an increase in consumption, investments, government spending, and exports and imports. According to the initial calculations of the fourth quarter and 2024 GDP, published by the BEA, the slowdown in growth in the last three months of the year was due to a decline in investment, which was offset by an increase in consumer spending and a reduction in imports. Despite the deceleration compared to the strong pace of the third quarter, the economy defied the recession forecasts that emerged after the interest rate hikes applied by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2022 and 2023 to contain inflation. As Donald Trump would say, 'This is the kind of growth that I like to see.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 27, 2025 02:02 PM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/bloomberg/2025/03/27/esto-si-le-gusta-a-trump-pib-de-eu-crecio-de-23-a-24-en-ultimo-trimestre-de-2024/)\n\n**US GDP grows 2.4% in 4th quarter, 2.8% for 2024**\nThe United States' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the third and final reading released on Wednesday, 27, by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The number confirmed the previous estimate and came in line with market expectations. The expansion was driven by increases in consumer and government spending. Although the result was positive, it represents a deceleration compared to the previous quarter, when the economy grew 3.1%. The decline was mainly driven by a reduction in investments and exports, but was offset by the strength of internal consumption. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which measures inflation and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.4%, while the core index, which excludes food and energy, increased 2.6%, slightly below the previous estimate. Despite the deceleration, the annual GDP growth in 2024 was 2.8%, driven by consumer and government spending, while imports decreased, contributing to the final result. Experts point out that internal consumption was the main driver of the economy, even in a scenario of high interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve to control inflation. Despite the expansion, challenges ahead, such as weakness in investments and global deceleration, may pressure growth in the next quarters.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 27, 2025 01:16 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/economia/pib-dos-eua-cresce-24-no-4a-tri-e-28-no-ano-de-2024/)\n\n**US GDP Growth Revised to 2.3% in Q4, Core PCE Inflation Rises to 2.7%**\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released data on Thursday (27th) showing that the US economy grew steadily at the end of last year, but inflationary pressure was stronger than expected. The fourth quarter of last year's GDP growth rate was revised to 2.3%, in line with market expectations and unchanged from the initial value, but slower than the 3.1% growth rate in the third quarter of last year. The core PCE price index, which the Federal Reserve (Fed) favors, rose to 2.7% in the fourth quarter, exceeding market expectations and initial values, and higher than the 2.2% growth rate in the third quarter. This was driven mainly by service costs. The report shows that the US economy continues to expand steadily, driven by consumer spending, despite higher interest rates and living costs affecting low-income households. However, the economic growth outlook is more pessimistic. With employment growth slowing down and consumption demand being suppressed, the US GDP growth rate is estimated to be 2.3% this year, down from 2.8% in 2024. Additionally, due to strong inflation, Fed policymakers have become more cautious about future rate cuts. Market expectations are that the January PCE price index report, to be released on Friday (28th), will show that personal spending has fallen for the first time in a year, with a core PCE annual growth rate of 2.6%. This data will provide the latest clues on the trajectory of US inflation and may have a significant impact on Fed policy decisions.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 03:42 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/5877319)\n\n**US Economy Expected to Maintain Moderate Growth in Q1 2025**\nThe US economy is expected to maintain moderate growth in the first quarter of 2025, according to various Nowcasts compiled by CapitalSpectator.com. The initial estimate suggests that the growth rate of over 2% reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for the fourth quarter will continue into the first three months of the year. The median of current forecasts predicts a real production increase of 2.3% (annualized). However, early predictions should be viewed with caution, as much can change before the first official GDP estimate is released by the BEA on April 30. Analysts warn of rising inflation risks, particularly due to planned tax hikes, which could come at a sensitive time, as inflation remains stubborn. The government reported that consumer prices rose by 3.0% in January compared to the previous year, the highest level since June 2024. This has implications for monetary policy, with the Fed likely to have little room for interest rate cuts in the near future. In fact, they may be forced to raise interest rates if inflation continues to rise. On the other hand, sustained inflation pressure could slow down economic growth. For now, the US economy remains robust, at least according to current GDP estimates. However, with changing economic policy, there is much room for discussion about future growth dynamics.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 06:47 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/analysis/usbip-fur-das-1-quartal-moderates-stetiges-wachstum-erwartet-200496303)\n\n**US Economy Expected to Maintain Moderate Growth in Q1 2025**\nThe US economy is expected to maintain a moderate growth rate in the first quarter of 2025, according to projections compiled by CapitalSpectator.com. The initial estimate suggests that the growth rate above 2% recorded in the fourth quarter, as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), will continue into the beginning of this year. The median projection indicates an annualized growth rate of 2.3% in real terms. However, there is a significant level of uncertainty until the official BEA release on April 30. Factors such as changes in economic policy under President Trump and potential inflationary impacts from tariff increases pose risks to this scenario. Analysts warn that a persistent high inflation rate, currently at 3.0% in January, may hinder economic growth and make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the short term. Despite these uncertainties, the US economy continues to show resilience, but the outlook for growth remains open-ended.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/analysis/pib-dos-eua-no-1o-tri-deve-ter-crescimento-moderado-mas-constante-200468839)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasting experts overwhelmingly agree that the probability of the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth showing an increase is low, though not zero. Virtually all forecasters note the historical rarity of negative second estimates flipping to positive in the third estimate, with base rates usually below 10\u201320%. The most commonly cited drivers of the negative Q1 GDP (currently at -0.2%) include a massive inventory build, a surge in imports ahead of new tariffs, weak personal consumption, and declining government spending. These factors are considered unlikely to be revised away in the third estimate, as major surprises from late-arriving data (inventories, trade, or consumption) are rare at this stage and would be required to see a positive figure. Some forecasters raise the possibility\u2014albeit modest\u2014of a small upward swing due to the marginally negative value (just -0.2%) and the historical fact that, very occasionally, late data infusions flip the sign of GDP. However, all agree that, absent major positive surprises in core underlying data, the third estimate typically results in minor revisions of +/-0.1\u20130.2 percentage points and rarely crosses significant thresholds. Final probabilities range from 7% to 33%, with most clustering between 12% and 18%. The overall consensus is that the odds of Q1 2025 real GDP growth being revised to above 0.0% in the BEA\u2019s third estimate are very low, with persistence of the negative outcome strongly favored."
