Florida\u2019s unique mutation of party-switcher narratives should make anyone careful about assuming literal headline phrasing matches state-level technical realities or community perception. American political culture is all about the ritual\u2014filing, speechifying, full press conferences\u2014and only after those boxes are ticked do the insiders consider it 'real.' Don\u2019t let the power of a narrative frame blind you to the possibility of behind-the-scenes ambiguity, legal technicalities, or local actors\u2019 reticence to treat it as final. Media frames help but aren\u2019t the last word\u2014dig deeper than headline repetition or you\u2019ll miss the rare but genuine dissociation between narrative and event."

Jolly, a vocal Trump critic, says his decision to align with the Florida Democratic Party is a continuation of his 'political evolution.' He plans to visit with traditional Democratic supporters as well as groups he says have 'been ignored' by statewide Dems, including churchgoers and gun owners. Jolly pushed back on comparisons to former Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, saying 'I have become a Democrat out of conviction,' and 'I've changed. I've grown.'

Jolly's decision comes at a time when the Democratic field is relatively empty, with no other notable candidates having announced their intention to run. Jolly's campaign aims to unify the party and attract unaffiliated voters and Republicans. He believes that the 2026 cycle will be a 'change election' driven by Trump's policies and the unaffordability of Florida under GOP leadership. Jolly has already spoken with state Sen. Jason Pizzo, who plans to run as an independent, and has expressed respect for Pizzo's decision. Meanwhile, the state legislature is in the midst of budget negotiations, with several key issues still unresolved, including funding for state parks, the Florida Wildlife Corridor, and the Holocaust museum. Additionally, a federal judge has placed a temporary halt on part of a new law tightening Florida's control over ballot initiatives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 06:59 AM\nSource:[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2025/06/05/jolly-takes-the-plunge-into-wide-open-field-00388857)\n\n**Florida 2026: David Jolly governor campaign announcement coming soon**\nFormer Congressman David Jolly plans to announce his decision to run for governor in Florida in the coming days. A Jolly candidacy for the Democratic nomination seems all but certain, as he has been holding town halls throughout the state and meeting with grassroots activists, elected officials, and potential donors. Jolly emphasized the importance of Broward County, with the largest number of registered Democrats in the state, in a statewide campaign. He stated, 'In many ways the governorship runs through Broward County. If we have (robust) turnout numbers among Broward Democrats but also among Black voters here in Broward and in South Florida, we win the governorship.' Jolly's campaign website highlights issues such as property insurance costs, public school funding, reproductive freedom, campaign finance reform, and reducing gun violence. His wife, Laura, and Mitchell Berger, a seasoned Democratic fundraiser, were in attendance at the Broward Democratic Party's annual fundraising dinner, where Jolly made his announcement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 10:16 AM\nSource:[SunSentinel](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/06/01/florida-2026-david-jolly-governor-campaign-announcement-coming-soon/)\n\n**David Jolly and Josh Weil test drive their campaign messages at Pinellas town hall**\nDavid Jolly, a former Republican turned Democrat, and Josh Weil, a Central Florida public middle school instructor, are testing their campaign messages ahead of their potential candidacies for governor and U.S. Senate in 2026. Jolly, who plans to announce his candidacy for governor in mid-June, emphasized the need for a 'constitutional crisis' to be addressed and the importance of expanding Medicaid, investing in renewable energy, and being tough on crime. He also discussed gun safety and the need for the Democratic Party to go to places where their candidates haven't ventured in a long time. Weil, who lost to Republican Randy Fine in the Congressional District 6 special election, said that Democrats have too often written off congressional districts that they don't believe they can win. He plans to raise $10 million for voter registration efforts across the state over the next 16 months, with a particular interest in Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties. Jolly's former party affiliation and past conservative positions may become an issue in his campaign, but he is now a 'full proponent of codifying the Roe-Casey framework at the national and state level.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 21, 2025 06:29 PM\nSource:[Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay](https://www.cltampa.com/news/david-jolly-and-josh-weil-test-drive-their-campaign-messages-at-pinellas-town-hall-20067051)\n\n**Three-way governor's race ahead**\nState Sen.

Pizzo plans to spend $25 million of his own money on the campaign and has said he would consider picking a Republican to join the ticket. However, Democrats are concerned that Pizzo's candidacy will split their vote and make it easier for Republicans to win. Pizzo has cast himself as a centrist, uninterested in debating culture war issues, and has pointed out that Florida's 3.6 million unaffiliated voters could play a key role in the election.

He believes his position and message are resonating with many people and groups. Pizzo, who has been in two competitive races, including unseating a sitting state senator, pointed out that 'NPAs decide who wins elections in this state, there's 3.7 million of them.'

He cites the tumult of President Donald Trump's second term and the public reaction to it as a reason for his decision. Jolly has been holding town hall meetings across the state, where he has been discussing his background, views on major issues, and plans for ending Florida Republicans' decades-long winning streak. He has also been meeting with elected officials, political leaders, and potential donors to build support for his campaign. Jolly's positions on issues such as abortion, gun control, and climate change have resonated with the town hall audience, and he has gained the support of several key Democrats, including Mitchell Berger and Fernand Amandi. However, some analysts have expressed skepticism about Jolly's chances, citing the state's Republican leanings and the difficulty of winning a statewide election as a Democrat.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 02, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[SunSentinel](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/05/03/david-jolly-entices-florida-democrats-with-dream-of-winning-2026-governors-race/)\n\n**A new Democrat takes the stage in Broward**\nFormer Rep.

Jolly also addressed concerns about his past positions, including on firearms and climate change, and promised to codify Amendment 4, which would allow abortion in Florida until fetal viability. The event was seen as a preview of Jolly's potential run for governor in 2026. Meanwhile, the Florida Legislature passed a bill to give condo owners breathing room from rising costs associated with mandates put in place after the collapse of a Surfside condominium tower. The bill also bans oil drilling near the Apalachicola River and Bay.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts, drawing on diverse perspectives including political consulting, Florida campaign law, electoral analysis, political science, media studies, and American political culture, are in near-total agreement that David Jolly has already publicly and officially announced his candidacy for Florida governor as a Democrat before July 1, 2025. Their reasoning is based on widespread, explicit, and mutually confirming reports from numerous reputable news outlets\u2014such as the New York Times, POLITICO, Tampa Bay Times, and others\u2014all dated June 5, 2025 or earlier. These reports cite direct quotations from Jolly, mention formal campaign announcements, filings, and public events, and show alignment with party elites, campaign infrastructure, and legal requirements. The experts emphasize that the probability of misreporting or an immediate retraction is extremely small, given both the volume and clarity of evidence and the very low historical base rate for major candidates to withdraw or see their announcement retracted in these circumstances. Alternative 'No' scenarios are considered only remotely plausible, requiring unprecedented coordination of error or reversal. Final probability estimates consistently range from 99% to 100%, with a consensus that the resolution criteria have been overwhelmingly met and that this question will resolve 'Yes' barring extremely unlikely and unforeseen events."
