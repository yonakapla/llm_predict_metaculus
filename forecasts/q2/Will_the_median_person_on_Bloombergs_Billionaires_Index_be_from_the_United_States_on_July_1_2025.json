Only about a month remains, and no reports suggest a reversal via US gains or European/crypto declines at the margin. Market volatility could shift things, but recent US tech corrections (as noted in the news) suggest the tailwind is more to non-US than US mobility. The index's methodology, based on net worth and nationality as documented by Bloomberg, tends to be slow to reattribute countries and doesn't quickly reflect small, cross-national fortunes. Absent a large movement in US equity markets or a crypto crash, it is more likely that the median will remain non-US. Base rate: In previous years, the median was US, but the new Italian surge and the April snapshot show a plausible shift away from US for July.

Given the strong contestation and the underlying unpredictability of both crypto and tech-heavy wealth movements\u2014and acknowledging that my initial estimate possibly underweighted the 'reversion' tendency when a gap is not large\u2014I am nudging my probability up slightly. However, I remain below 50% due to the fundamental trends and current snapshot. Revised probability: 33%.",

On the flip side, the strongest arguments for a US return centered on both the sheer volume of US billionaires and the latent volatility on the marginal slots. However, the last few months have already absorbed high crypto and European volatility without a US median snapback. There is no clear imminent catalyst (like a major US market rally or crypto crash) to force a rapid reversal before July 1. While a complete disregard for US statistical momentum would be rash, the additional arguments slightly reinforce my view that the new normal is a non-US median, though with modestly increased downside risk if the US market suddenly rallies. On balance, the information warrants only a slight reduction in confidence\u2014by 2 percentage points\u2014to reflect open tail risk for US median resurgence.",

Critiques of heavy reliance on historical structural advantage did remind me that the median is more sensitive to sudden regional/sectoral fortune surges than, say, the top 10. However, I found the more bearish forecasts (sub-50% US), and even the mid-range ones, to underweight just how statistically lopsided the US billionaire cohort remains, and how median volatility often results in US billionaires reclaiming the median quickly after blips. There is merit in noting the Italian/crypto position could persist, but with a month left, and given recent US market outperformance and the tendency for US names to reassert at exactly these thresholds, my confidence remains quite high. Nevertheless, I\u2019ll modestly lower my probability to acknowledge the persistence risk highlighted by the criticism and the lack of an obvious short-term catalyst for US upward movement.

Critiques of the high-confidence US median snapback (e.g., WealthmanagementHighnetworthtracking's 78%) failed to convincingly rebut the core point that the old margin buffer of US dominance is eroding due to independent asset cycles and elite transition dynamics, a trend I already weighted heavily but see further validated by the broader argument consensus. At the same time, the group pushed me to acknowledge how close these probabilities remain and how quickly net worth clusterings can pivot on asset volatility. The gap between US and non-US at the median is now a coin-flip region\u2014not as low as 27% but not robustly in favor of the US either. However, further review makes me slightly more confident that global wealth dispersion and elite turnover, especially absent a large late-June US rally or spectacular crypto collapse, will keep the 250th spot non-US this cycle.",

Some arguments highlighted that recent midlist wealth transfers, particularly inheritance and crypto-driven gains, can persist for months, with less sensitivity to US market churn than in past cycles. While I am not persuaded by extremely low odds for a US median, the critical mass of international billionaires at the 200\u2013300 ranks and the recency of their accumulation means the statistical inertia of the US is less decisive than it once was. Volatility can quickly flip the median, but the specific combination of inheritance booms, European entrance, and crypto market stickiness argues for a decreased probability that the median will revert to the US in just a month without a clear catalyst.

Multiple forecasters, especially from economics, journalism, and sociological perspectives, note that the wave of non-US (mostly Italian, European, and crypto) billionaires entering or maintaining positions around the median is more than noise; it's a new phase in global elite wealth building. The bullish US base-rate arguments are challenged convincingly: US 'bench strength' doesn't guarantee constant median dominance, especially as new billionaire pipelines (inheritance, crypto) become more entrenched. No compelling evidence suggests a US median snapback is likely in the coming month, barring a disruptive event (e.g., crypto crash or massive US market rally), and the time horizon is too short for a structural reversion.

The critique of relying too much on base rates, while ignoring the current, well-documented anomaly of an Italian median and the broader internationalization of the billionaire population, is valid. The risk of recency bias cutting both ways is real\u2014yet the statistical weight of over 900 US billionaires and the volatility of margins still lend the US an edge, though a smaller one. I now judge the US's edge as thinner and would shade my forecast lower, giving nearly even odds to a rapid US resurgence but acknowledging the plausible persistence of the new international cohort.",

His leadership in the electric vehicle market, space exploration, and artificial intelligence has contributed to his success. Musk's net worth increased by $46 billion in April, solidifying his position as the leader in these sectors. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, comes in second with a fortune of $201.6 billion, despite a $5.3 billion loss due to a 4% decline in Amazon's stock price. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, ranks third with a net worth of $190 billion, despite a $9.3 billion decline in his fortune due to a 5% drop in Meta's stock price. Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, comes in fourth with a net worth of $176.9 billion, thanks to the growth of Oracle and his participation in the Proyecto Stargate. Warren Buffett, who announced that he will leave the direction of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of 2025, ranks fifth with a net worth of $166.4 billion. Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, ranks sixth with a net worth of $146.5 billion, despite a 14.6 billion decline in his fortune due to a 15% drop in LVMH's stock price. The ranking of the world's richest people is not just about accumulated wealth, but also about their ability to adapt to a changing economic environment. The recovery of Tesla was essential for Musk, and he has taken advantage of opportunities in the technology sector. Other individuals, such as Bezos, Arnault, and Ellison, have also increased their wealth during this period. Despite market volatility, most of the billionaires have managed to maintain or increase their wealth, suggesting that certain sectors continue to thrive. The diversification of investments and innovation in their respective fields have been key to their success.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 08:47 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/mundo/2025/05/28/quien-es-el-hombre-mas-rico-del-mundo-en-2025-descubre-a-cuanto-asciende-su-fortuna-evatia-1500604)\n\n**Forbes Releases 2024 Billionaires List: Record Number of 3,028 Billionaires Worldwide**\nForbes magazine has released its 2024 Billionaires List, which shows a record number of 3,028 billionaires worldwide, with a total wealth of $16.1 trillion, a 2 trillion dollar increase from last year.

    "summary": "Forecasters are divided on whether the median person (250th-ranked) on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index will be from the United States on July 1, 2025. Those favoring a 'Yes' outcome (final probabilities 68-80%) emphasize the historical and statistical dominance of US billionaires, strong US equity market performance, and the sheer size and stability of the US billionaire class. They argue that recent non-US surges (notably Italian, crypto-based, and inheritance-driven fortunes) at the 250th rank are likely temporary, with the US likely to revert to the median spot due to base rates and market churn in the coming month.\n\nConversely, forecasters favoring a 'No' outcome (final probabilities 27-41%, with one at 77%) highlight the recent surge of non-US billionaires\u2014especially from Italy and the crypto sector\u2014pushing a non-American (Giancarlo Devasini) to the median as of April 30. They note that internationalization is accelerating, with base rates for US dominance at the median less secure than before. The short time horizon (about a month) and the volatility and continued entry of non-US billionaires (particularly from Europe and emerging markets) suggest this new dynamic could persist through July 1, 2025, unless there is a significant US market rally or a major drop in non-US fortunes.\n\nMost forecasters agree the outcome will be close and driven by late-breaking market or crypto volatility. Some argue the historical US base rate edge still gives the US the advantage, while others believe current trends point to a non-US billionaire remaining at the median by July 1. The median probability estimate across all experts is near 50%, but the consensus clusters into two camps: one moderately confident in a US outcome, the other moderately confident in continued non-US representation at the 250th slot."
