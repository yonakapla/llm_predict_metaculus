Microtargeting informs not only how candidates use resources to turn out their base and win swing voters, but also how campaigns in multi-candidate fields can maximize strengths or mitigate weaknesses in segmented electorates. The Virginia Democratic primary is an 'open' low-turnout contest, highly sensitive to organizational, geographic, and demographic targeting, money, endorsements, and mobilization effects\u2014public polling is rare and unreliable. Accurately mapping which candidate can identify and bring their voters to the polls is central to this forecast.",

By emphasizing Stoney's urban machine support and Eggleston's endorsement, you sound like you think institutional signals are injection-molds for turnout.

Your 28% is crafted like you're hedging, but it leans too heavily on old-school assumptions about late field endorsements and ignores how easy it is for a regional plurality to slip through in this type of contest.

However, they differ on specific policies and issues, such as gaming and education. Alex Bastani, a retired economist and lawyer, is running to the left of the other candidates, proposing a slate of pro-worker policies, including raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour and providing free college to all Virginians.

Babur B. Lateef, a prominent Northern Virginia eye surgeon, has made opposition to a Northern Virginia casino a prominent issue and calls for eliminating skill games. State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored high-profile legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market.

According to a Honan Strategy Group survey, 38% of likely New York City Democratic voters would back Hochul in a primary election, while 37% would back Torres. In a hypothetical primary between Hochul, Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado, and Torres, Hochul would win 46% of the vote. However, 55% of people want 'someone else' to be the next governor, with 36% specifically wanting Hochul. If Hochul and Republican Representative Elise Stefanik won their primaries and faced each other in the general election, the polling organization co/efficient found a statistical tie.

Gerry Connolly of Virginia. The contest is expected to be a competitive four-way race between Reps. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, and Robert Garcia of California. This election will test Democrats' commitment to their seniority system for committee leadership and their willingness to promote younger members, according to two sources who spoke anonymously.

The data shows that conversations surrounding Spanberger online have dropped from 9% in February and March to 5% in April and May, indicating a lack of enthusiasm among her base. Phil Snape of Impact Social stated, 'This isn't apathy, it's disengagement. Democrats are showing up online, just not for her.' The analysis also found that negative conversations on social media regarding Trump from Democrats are more prevalent, with a net of -12, compared to conversations surrounding Spanberger, which have a net of -45 and -47. Snape added, 'Our sentiment insight reveals a serious vulnerability: Spanberger is struggling to energize her own base.' The results of the analysis suggest that Spanberger may lack the key support needed to move her campaign in a winning direction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 11:02 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/virginia-democrats-support-may-eroding-among-strongest-backers-data-2077212)\n\n**Eggleston issues endorsement in lieutenant governor's race**\nFormer lieutenant governor candidate Carl Eggleston has endorsed Levar Stoney in the Democratic primary.

On the Democratic side, six candidates are competing, including former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and State Sens. Ghazala Hashmi and Aaron Rouse. On the Republican side, radio host John Reid is running after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity dropped out due to health reasons. Mark Rozell, dean of George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government, said, 'It is highly likely that one of these candidates who emerges as lieutenant governor or attorney general is going to be a future gubernatorial nominee and governor of the state.' There will be no primary in the governor's race, as both parties have already selected their nominees. Early voting begins on May 2.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 22, 2025 02:03 PM\nSource:[wtop.com](https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/in-va-primary-most-action-is-in-lieutenant-governor-races/)\n\n**Former Virginia delegate launches 2025 gubernatorial bid**\nFormer Virginia delegate Dave LaRock has launched a bid for the 2025 Republican gubernatorial nomination, challenging Lt.

    "summary": "Across a diverse panel of experts analyzing the June 2025 Virginia Democratic lieutenant governor primary, forecasts for Aaron Rouse\u2019s chances of winning cluster mostly in the 18\u201340% range, with a consensus that he is a credible, top-tier contender but an underdog relative to Levar Stoney. Common reasons for this view include:\n\n- Levar Stoney leads in both fundraising and key endorsements, most notably the influential Carl Eggleston, signaling party establishment momentum. This is frequently cited as a significant disadvantage for Rouse.\n- Rouse\u2019s strengths include a strong regional base in Hampton Roads/Virginia Beach and a track record on progressive issues (e.g. renters\u2019 rights, cannabis policy), which could help him in a split field if turnout is strong in his demographic and geographic strongholds.\n- Ghazala Hashmi is another major candidate, primarily drawing from Northern Virginia and progressive/immigrant voter blocs, further complicating the field and creating potential for vote-splitting among both establishment and progressive coalitions.\n- The archetype of Virginia Democratic primaries points to the better-funded, institutionally supported candidates winning most of the time, though upsets from regional or demographic mobilization have happened, especially in crowded fields.\n- The lack of public polling introduces substantial uncertainty. Most forecasters rely heavily on visible campaign infrastructure, regional turnout models, candidate profiles, the impact of endorsements, and base rates from similar historical contests.\n\nBest-case scenarios for Rouse involve strong mobilization in Hampton Roads and among Black and progressive voters, exploiting splits between Stoney and Hashmi\u2019s bases, allowing Rouse to win a narrow plurality. Worst-case (and most likely) scenarios suggest Stoney\u2019s fundraising and institutional advantages\u2014especially Eggleston\u2019s endorsement\u2014allow him to consolidate enough support to prevail.\n\nIndividual forecasts ranged from 18% on the low end (seeing Rouse as a clear long shot given the adverse fundraising/endorsement landscape) to about 40% at the high end (factoring in historical upsets and potential regional turnout surges). The modal forecast, drawing from median and mean values, is in the low- to mid-20% range. Virtually all experts note Rouse cannot be counted out, but his path to victory requires optimal field execution and a perfect storm of anti-Stoney vote-splitting. Hashmi is viewed as a real but lesser threat. Overall, experts see Rouse as a viable but disadvantaged candidate, with Stoney currently the favorite due to campaign resources and establishment backing."
