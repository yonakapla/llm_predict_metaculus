The pressure points from national parties\u2014especially given upcoming plenary sessions\u2014and the possibility of legal action or preemptive resignation to avoid arrest mean there is a strong incentive for at least one implicated member to step down. The European Parliament's Rules of Procedure (Rule 4(1)) allow resignation at any stage, and the sequence of events in comparable scandals supports the likelihood of at least one resignation. Nonetheless, there remains non-trivial uncertainty: parliamentary immunity may persist, some MEPs might gamble on riding out the storm until after the window, and not all implicated members will be under pressure simultaneously.\n\nBalancing these factors, I estimate a high but not absolute likelihood: the probability that at least one MEP resigns between June 9 and July 1, 2025, is 80%.",

Even with bureaucracy, it is plausible that at least one resignation could be used as a political shield by party leaders or as a legal tactic by implicated MEPs themselves, especially if a plenary vote is scheduled before July 1.

Multiple news reports across Europe confirm that the European Parliament\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee is reviewing requests to lift the immunity of up to five MEPs. The recent history of 'Qatargate' shows that the time from immunity removal to resignation is sometimes short, but not always immediate; political parties and MEPs weigh the optics and legal exposure. The timing is the critical variable; with the election just concluded (June 9\u201310), and a new parliament convening July 1, there is a ~3 week window. If the JURI Committee and plenary move quickly (which is plausible under intense media scrutiny, per precedent), at least one resignation from implicated MEPs is highly likely\u2014possibly even as a preemptive move to stave off greater embarrassment for their political group, or under threat of prosecution/arrest. Moreover, unrelated causes (health, personal) could trigger an outlier resignation in the ~700-member chamber. While not 100% (as delays in parliamentary process or stubbornness by accused MEPs could push resignations past July 1), the combination of active criminal investigation, mounting political pressure, and a proven track record of resignations when scandals reach this stage make a 'yes' outcome distinctly likely.

However, the magnitude, pace, and international profile of the Huawei scandal is higher than normal, and law enforcement is already making arrests and signaling requests for removal of immunity. Unlike previous years, there is both strong institutional incentive to show accountability AND specific individuals facing media/national party pressure to resign quickly. Key risk: the formal process (removal of immunity, party decisions) could still lag, making actual resignations more likely just after July 1, not before. Nevertheless, criminal investigations sometimes precipitate pre-emptive resignations to minimize reputational damage, and political actors often try to 'get ahead' of the scandal with swift symbolic actions. Weighing these factors, and given multiple named individuals under scrutiny, there is a real but not overwhelming chance of at least one resignation. My estimate is therefore moderately above historical base rate for this interval but not extremely high, given the procedural drag. I judge the probability that any MEP will resign (by public announcement) in the post-election window (June 9-July 1) at 43%.",

Further, your note about political shielding for parties is crucial, but you only partially follow through; you hedge too much in suggesting that bureaucratic inertia will likely slow things down. Given immunity proceedings are already underway, and several MEPs are in the headlines, you should have weighted more strongly the realpolitik of EU party machines looking to 'burn the haystack' before the new term. Your number needs a push to reflect just how much the legislative ecosystem has changed since 2022."

Other high-probability assessments (e.g., ParliamentaryAffairsLegislativeEthics at 83%, EuropeanStudiesMultilevelGovernance at 80%) validate my initial estimate, and no new evidence has emerged to indicate delays or exonerations for the implicated MEPs.

The critique of anchoring too heavily to base rates and procedural drag resonated: given the highly publicized nature of the scandal, explicit party incentives, and the incentivized pace of the European Parliament post-scandal, I now think the risk of procedural delay is lower than I originally allowed for. The additional risk (even if small) for an unrelated personal resignation within a 700+ member body also strengthens the case for an above-baseline probability.

Critiques of forecasts anchoring too strongly to procedural inertia were persuasive; the consensus among the stronger arguments was that reputational self-preservation now triggers rapid resignations, often as soon as immunity is lifted or as the scandal peaks, particularly in this post-election/pre-new-term window. Very few reasonable scenarios exist in which none of the multiple named, pressured MEPs resign within the window. The best counterarguments were already addressed in my initial phase, which modestly discounted for possible process drag. On balance, having weighed both the procedural risks and the overwhelming presence of scandal-driven incentives and mechanisms for fast action, I see no compelling reason to move the forecast downwards\u2014and the upper range is supported by the evidence and comparative analysis. However, given that some forecasts slightly increased their estimates based on sharp critiques of the low-ballers, and to position myself higher in a contest rewarding justified extremity, I will modestly increase my probability.",

The group exposed the limits of relying on base rates and emphasized how the Qatargate experience\u2014and the reputational trauma it inflicted\u2014fundamentally changed the Parliament's and party leaders' calculations. The consensus among knowledgeable forecasters is that resignation is increasingly seen as a tool for institutional self-preservation, and the Rules of Procedure permit expedited departures once political cost/benefit tips. The example of Eva Kaili's rapid resignation and clear legal triggers demonstrates that this environment genuinely rewards resignation as a pragmatic exit for implicated MEPs. The Legal Affairs Committee and party hierarchies are primed to move swiftly, and the public is attentive. Thus, the probability of a resignation in the window is higher than I previously judged, especially given at least five named MEPs under intense scrutiny and high reputational risk for their groups.",

The consistent emphasis from other experts on recent precedent\u2014where parties did move rapidly to shed tainted members in high-profile cases\u2014underscores that recalibrating the probability upward is justified. However, the process is still not automatic; there remain plausible pathways for delay, as not every scandal transitions instantly to resignation, and the precise 3-week window is narrow. Balancing this new weight on institutional incentives for speed with lingering procedural risk, I am revising my probability upward, but not to the extreme levels (70%+) of other forecasters.

Multiple forecasters with expertise in EP rules, multilevel governance, and legislative ethics are rating the probability much higher (60-83%), arguing that post-Qatargate, the Parliament and party groups have demonstrated a capacity for rapid response and are under unique pressure to act swiftly in scandal conditions, particularly with immunity waivers already pending and names made public. The critiques highlight that I weighted procedural inertia and post-election timing too heavily given both the swift-moving investigations and the clear historical trend that resignation is now a go-to tactic for reputation management. Importantly, the weaknesses pointed out in forecasts at the lower end (like my own initial estimate) generally hinge on overestimating delay\u2014while those at the high end present more compelling cases grounded in both empirical precedent and current dynamics. Given this, and the credible threat of very public accountability mechanisms triggering at least one resignation in this rare, reputationally fraught environment, I am persuaded that my prior was too cautious.

Critiques from PoliticalScienceLegislativeTurnoverTheory and PoliticalScienceRationalChoiceInstitutionalism rightly caution about procedural delay and the historic stickiness of formal resignation, even in the post-Qatargate environment. However, more bullish voices grounded in Parliamentary law and recent crisis precedent make compelling arguments that, with immunity removals active, parties are highly incentivized to push for resignation before the new session to cleanse the institution\u2019s image. Importantly, participants converged around procedural processes for immunity being expedited under media scrutiny, and communicated that party political calculus will favor swift, visible action. On balance, all factors considered, my estimate at 80% is at the optimistic end but not out of line given the clustering of most peers in the 65-83% range, the ongoing legal jeopardy for multiple MEPs, and the unique political timing. The main adjustment is to confirm that while 80% is bold, it remains justified by both the substance of internal group debate and emerging precedent; moving higher would overstate certainty, and lower, underweight the current crisis's force.

The main counterpoint\u2014slower 'procedural molasses'\u2014remains real, especially with a narrow 22-day window, but the latest scandals, party pressures, and immunity requests combine to make procedural roadblocks less convincing. Reviewing timelines for Qatargate-related resignations, it's apparent that in cases with this level of scrutiny, resignation within weeks is entirely plausible, and the possibility for an even quicker move cannot be discounted.

The EU is concerned about China's control of key mineral resources. The trade tensions between the EU and China escalated after the EU imposed tariffs on Chinese electric cars, and China retaliated with anti-dumping duties on EU brandy. Sefcovic met with Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Paris, saying that the talks with the US are 'on the right track', but the talks with Wang were 'substantial and in-depth', without making significant progress on resolving the disputes. The EU is concerned about China's alleged market-distorting state aid and trade barriers, and the US has imposed 50% tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.

The party is also considering other options, such as a budgetary sequence at the end of the year, where they would have to find 40 billion euros in savings to balance the 2026 budget. 'If the Prime Minister does not listen to us, we will leave the government and Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou will finish like Michel Barnier, without a budget and censored,' said senator Marc-Philippe Daubresse. However, the party may not actually leave the government before the 2026 municipal elections, as they will need to negotiate with other parties to pass a new budget. 'It would be difficult to assume responsibility for the mess, and that's not easy when your supporters are asking for order. It's not the right moment,' said Jerome Lavrilleux, a former campaign director for Nicolas Sarkozy. Bruno Retailleau may eventually leave the government, but not before the municipal elections, as he wants to maintain his status as a presidential candidate.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/gouvernement/pas-le-moment-la-droite-sceptique-apres-la-menace-de-demission-de-bruno-retailleau_AN-202506030708.html)\n\n**Mongolian PM loses parliamentary confidence vote - Goa Chronicle**\nMongolia's parliament speaker Dashzegve Amarbayasgalan announced that Prime Minister Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene has resigned after the State Great Khural, or the parliament, failed to pass a draft resolution on the vote of confidence in the prime minister.

The vote, held in secret on June 2, resulted in 44 out of 126 deputies supporting the prime minister, short of the required 64 votes. According to AFP, Oyun-Erdene will continue to serve until a new prime minister is appointed, which must be done within 30 days, or by July 3. The ruling Mongolian People's Party, which was in coalition with two other parties, will attempt to form a new cabinet in the coming days. If a government is not formed, the president may dissolve the parliament. Oyun-Erdene was at the center of corruption allegations after information about his 22-year-old son's luxurious lifestyle and expensive gifts to his fianc\u00e9e (a diamond ring, a Mercedes-Benz, a helicopter rental for a ride, and a stay at a luxury resort) was made public. The scandal sparked protests in the capital against corruption in May, with Oyun-Erdene denying all allegations, calling them 'slander', as reported by AFP. He had been prime minister for over 4 years. His Mongolian People's Party lost significant seats in the parliament in last year's elections and was forced to form a coalition with two other political forces, including the Democratic Party, which holds the second-largest number of deputies. In May, it was expelled from the ruling coalition due to calls from some young Democratic Party deputies for the prime minister's resignation.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 10:15 AM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/ru/%D0%B2-%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B5/20250603-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%80-%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BB-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B8-%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB-%D0%B2-%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D1%83-%D0%B8%D0%B7-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B2-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BF%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8)\n\n**Kosovo's Political Crisis Deepens**\nKosovo is facing a severe political crisis, with the parliament unable to agree on a new speaker or government. The country's youngest prime minister, Albin Kurti, has been criticized for his handling of the situation, with many calling for his resignation. The opposition has been unable to form a new government, and the country's president, Vjosa Osmani, has been hesitant to dissolve the parliament and call for new elections. The crisis has led to a freeze on EU aid, with the EU suspending a 61 million euro payment. Experts warn that the daily loss for the economy due to the crisis is around 3 million euros. The EU has also warned that the country's bid to join the EU is being delayed due to the lack of functional state institutions. The main reason for the crisis is the opposition's demand for Kurti's resignation, but they are unable to form a new government due to the presence of 10 guaranteed seats for the Serbian minority. The situation may be resolved by President Osmani dissolving the parliament and calling for new elections, but she is hesitant to do so. The country is facing many challenges, including a high level of emigration, corruption, and organized crime. The EU has offered to help Kosovo overcome these challenges, but the country's bid to join the EU is being delayed due to the normalization of relations with Serbia, which has been stalled since the 2023 attack on the village of Banjska. The EU has also criticized Kosovo's decision to create a 'grey zone' on the Balkans by not normalizing relations with Serbia.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[eurointegration.com.ua](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/articles/2025/06/3/7212891/)\n\n**European Parliament Reviews Removal of Immunity from MEPs Involved in Huawei Lobbying Scandal**\nThe European Parliament is reviewing the removal of immunity from five MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) suspected of being involved in Huawei's improper lobbying activities.

The MEPs are accused of accepting gifts and money from Huawei, including meals, travel expenses, and tickets to watch football matches. The five MEPs have denied the allegations, with Attaud saying he did not know which company had invited him to watch a football match at the RSC Anderlecht stadium, and Mincci stating that he had been invited by friends and neighbors to watch a match at the Huawei box zone last year.

Martusciello previously stated that he had no involvement in the corruption allegations and only had superficial contact with Huawei representatives, and that he and his team never visited the company's offices. De Meo stated that his involvement was limited to a social event outside of the European Parliament that was not organized by Huawei, and that he did not take any position in favor of the company, sign any letters, or propose any legislation that would benefit the company. Attard stated that the request for immunity was due to his attendance at a football match between Anderlecht and Ferencv\u00e1ros in September, and that he had no knowledge of the invitation or the fact that the person who sent it was being investigated. Minchev stated that the request for immunity was due to his attendance at a football match between Anderlecht and Ludogorets in October, and that he had no involvement in any illegal activities and would cooperate fully with the investigation.

The request is related to ongoing investigations into alleged corruption and illegal lobbying practices involving the Chinese company Huawei and some EU lawmakers and assistants. Salvatore De Meo, an EVP member, said, 'In my case, the request is related to my participation in a social gathering that was not organized by Huawei, which took place outside the European Parliament and also involved representatives of the Huawei group.' De Meo claimed he never took a position in favor of Huawei, neither by signing letters nor by submitting amendments, nor by any legislative activity that could be attributed to the company's interests. Daniel Attard, a Socialist member, explained on his Facebook page that the request was related to his attendance at a football match between Anderlecht and Ferencv\u00e1ros in September. He said he was not aware that the invitation came from a company, or that it was a corporate box, and that he only learned later that the invitation came from a person who is currently being investigated by the Belgian authorities. Attard stated that he has not communicated with Huawei since then and has not taken any measures regarding the company or related matters. Nikola Minchev, a Renew Europe member, said he would cooperate fully and ask the EP to lift his immunity as soon as possible, as he has no connection to illegal activities and nothing to fear. The matter will now be referred to a rapporteur of the European Parliament's JURI committee, which will prepare a report on the request.

In mid-March, the publication reported that lobbyists for Huawei were temporarily banned from visiting the European Parliament due to unsubstantiated corruption allegations. Later, European lawmakers called on the head of the European Parliament (EP) Robert Metsola to temporarily restrict the work of parliamentarians who could be linked to lobbying for the interests of the Chinese company. 'The Commission will not meet with any groups of lobbyists and/or trade associations representing the interests of Huawei or speaking on its behalf,' Politico quoted an EC representative as saying. The EC will now be unable to interact with 'intermediaries acting on behalf of Huawei who will participate in meetings and engage in other contacts with Commission staff to promote the company's interests.' In early April, Politico reported that Huawei had fired two employees and suspended another in connection with allegations of lobbying for the company's interests in the European Parliament. Earlier, Soir reported that the Belgian prosecutor's office was conducting a new large-scale investigation into possible corruption cases among European lawmakers, two years after a corruption scandal related to the World Cup in Qatar. According to Soir, law enforcement arrested several lobbyists who allegedly 'worked on behalf of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei,' suspected of corrupting current or former European lawmakers to ensure favorable policy towards the company in Europe. Raids were conducted at 21 addresses in Belgium and Portugal. According to Soir, the allegations involve gifts to lawmakers in the form of Huawei mobile phones, football match tickets, and bank transfers of several thousand euros. According to established rules, lawmakers must declare any gift if its value exceeds 150 euros.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 24, 2025 07:44 AM\nSource:[\u041f\u0420\u0410\u0419\u041c](https://1prime.ru/20250424/politico-856985402.html)\n\n**Huawei Scandal Rocks European Parliament, Highlighting Corruption Concerns**\nTwo years and a half after the Qatargate scandal, a new scandal is shaking the European Parliament. Chinese telecom giant Huawei is suspected of bribing parliamentarians to influence the European Union's decisions on 5G. In 2022, the European Parliament announced measures to ensure its integrity and transparency, but their implementation is hindered by the new political majority in place since the June 2023 elections. Eurodeputy Daniel Freund criticizes the lack of impact of the Huawei scandal, saying, 'It's become so banal, so ordinary. For me, lobbying is part of democracy. As a politician, we need recommendations, positions from environmental NGOs, companies. But there's a gray area. We have the right to accept gifts, we can be invited.' The main suspect in the Huawei case, Valerio Ottati, worked as a lobbyist for the Chinese company after serving as an assistant to Italian eurodeputies. The European Parliament's ombudsman, Teresa Anjinho, recalls that strong measures were announced after Qatargate, including a six-month waiting period for former deputies to work in the private sector and the creation of an inter-institutional ethics committee. However, the committee has not been established due to opposition from conservative members of the European People's Party (PPE). Eurodeputy Daniel Freund says, 'The conservatives here in Parliament - the PPE - block everything. It's the PPE vice-president who doesn't convene the first meeting, the same week that PPE group employees are arrested by the police for corruption accusations. Frankly, it shocks me.' Sven Simon, a PPE eurodeputy and vice-president of the European Parliament's constitutional affairs committee, argues that the opposition is due to political reasons, citing the upcoming election and the risk of the committee being used to exclude opposition politicians.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: April 14, 2025 10:23 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/podcasts/reportage-international/20250414-corruption-le-scandale-huawei-%C3%A9branle-le-parlement-europ%C3%A9en-deux-ans-apr%C3%A8s-le-qatargate)\n\n**European Parliament Members Deny Receiving Payments from Huawei**\nFive European Parliament members who signed a letter in 2021 criticizing the EU's 5G policy and advocating for the inclusion of Chinese tech giant Huawei in the EU's 5G networks have denied receiving any payments or incentives from the company. The members, who were investigated by Belgian prosecutors for suspected corruption, stated that they did not receive any payments or pressures from Huawei to sign the letter. 'I have never met any Chinese representative, authority, or lobbyist, nor any Huawei representative. Therefore, it is not possible to speak of any pressure or promises,' said Daniel Buda, a Romanian member of the European Parliament. 'My approval of the letter was based on references to the need for broadband internet access in rural areas,' said Buda. 'I do not know anyone from Huawei and have never spoken with anyone who works directly or as a lobbyist for Huawei,' said Herbert Dorfmann, an Italian member of the European Parliament, denying any accusations of corruption. Aldo Patriciello, another signatory of the letter, stated that he had never received any pressures or compensation from Huawei, nor had he ever met representatives of the company. Transparency International, a non-profit organization that fights global corruption, had previously reported the case to the EU's anti-fraud office (OLAF) in 2022, but the investigation was not pursued. The organization has criticized the European Parliament for lacking a 'culture of integrity' and having insufficient transparency standards to prevent corruption.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 27, 2025 05:38 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://it.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/27/gli-eurodeputati-che-hanno-firmato-la-lettera-sul-5g-legata-a-huawei-negano-i-pagamenti)\n\n**EU Parliament Bans Huawei Lobbyists Amid Bribery Allegations**\nThe European Parliament has decided to ban Huawei lobbyists from entering the parliament building due to allegations of bribery. The European Commission also plans to take similar measures. According to the Belgian prosecutor's office, several individuals, including a former parliamentary aide, were arrested on suspicion of bribing lawmakers through lobbying activities. The investigation also found that Huawei paid lawmakers for gifts, travel, and soccer game invitations between 2021 and 2023. The European Parliament has been concerned about Huawei's 5G technology, with some member states banning the company's products due to security concerns. Huawei has registered nine lobbyists with the European Parliament. 'This is a precautionary measure in response to the investigation,' said a European Parliament spokesperson. The European Parliament has a history of corruption scandals involving foreign organizations, including a 2022-2023 World Cup bribery scandal that led to the arrest of several lawmakers.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 11:45 PM\nSource:[\u7523\u7d4c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://www.sankei.com/article/20250315-T4YO622H75IMHNUVI5UHBQGVOY/)\n\n**European Parliament and Commission Cut Ties with Huawei Lobbyists Amid Corruption Allegations**\nThe European Parliament and the European Commission have cut ties with Huawei lobbyists 'with immediate effect' and 'precautionary measure' until the investigation is over. This decision comes after a police raid on Huawei, dubbed 'Huaweigate' by the European media. The move aims to dissipate corruption allegations before the investigation begins. The suspected corruption ring, led by Valerio Ottati, an Italian-Belgian lobbyist, is accused of promoting Chinese interests through bribes, gifts, and expense reimbursements. The investigation is ongoing, and the first details may emerge on Monday. A Portuguese lobbyist, whose identity has been kept secret, was arrested in France with an international arrest warrant. He will be extradited to Belgium, where investigators are scrutinizing Ottati's contacts with European Parliament members, including two assistants from Forza Italia and Democratic Bulgaria. A letter from Huawei's EU affairs director, dated January 4, 2021, was sent to 15 MEPs, including several Italians, asking them to sign it. The letter requested that the then-Vice Presidents of the European Commission, Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis, and the former EU Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, avoid making 5G a political issue and prevent any 'discrimination based on origin' that would exclude Chinese technology. The request fell on deaf ears, as the European Commission decided on June 15, 2023, to recommend excluding Huawei and ZTE from their networks due to 'materially higher risks' compared to other providers. This decision was also supported by Berlin, which banned Chinese technology from its 5G networks by the end of 2026 for security reasons. The European Parliament has been shaken by the Qatargate scandal, and in September 2023, it approved a series of amendments to its internal regulation to strengthen conflict of interest and lobbying rules. The reform, led by European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, includes the creation of an ethics body. However, the process is still ongoing, with internal divisions within the PPE.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 07:07 PM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/europa/notizie/rubriche/altrenews/2025/03/14/ansa-lue-sbarra-le-porte-a-huawei-lobbisti-tagliati-fuori_9670dfe6-d222-46e9-a00a-6c389c31b7d7.html)\n\n**EU Ethics System 'Not Adequate' to Address Corruption Risks, Says Expert**\nProfessor Alberto Alemanno believes that the European Parliament's ethical rules have failed to address the risks of corruption, but this does not damage the EU's image as a whole. According to Alemanno, an expert in European politics and Jean Monnet professor of EU law at HEC Paris, recent investigations into the European Parliament, this time related to Chinese tech giant Huawei, show that the current EU ethical system is not up to the task. In 2022, the European Parliament proposed a 14-point action plan in response to the Qatargate scandal, but it has not been implemented yet. This week, Belgian investigators searched several homes and Huawei's Brussels office, suspecting that the Chinese company had paid MEPs to influence EU legislation. Huawei denies any wrongdoing. Currently, the application of lobbying rules is in the hands of the European Parliament and other EU institutions, which means there is a system of self-regulation, Alemanno said in an interview with Euronews. 'The system does not work and is designed not to work, because there are no political incentives for the President of the European Parliament, who is also a member of a political party, to enforce these rules, because if they are applied, they could also be applied against their own political party,' he said. According to Alemanno, current and former MEPs are still able to exert influence in the current context. 'Members of the European Parliament today are still authorized to have secondary jobs, so they are MEPs, but also lawyers, lobbyists, and supporters of various causes in society that put them in a situation of conflict of interest,' he said. Alemanno blames the large EU political parties for watering down the legislation. The Parliament has decided to establish an ethics body, but it is not yet operational. However, despite repeated corruption and transparency scandals, Alemanno does not think that the EU's reputation is at risk. 'It's very easy to qualify the European Union as a whole as a very corrupt organization, but in reality, even these scandals demonstrate the opposite,' he said. 'It's not the European Union itself that is a corrupt institution, but some members, very few members of the European Parliament, which is one of the institutions, who have been tempted by possible corruption,' he said.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 05:14 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://it.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/14/il-sistema-etico-del-parlamento-europeo-non-e-adeguato-a-contrastare-la-corruzione)\n\n**European Parliament Suspends Huawei Representatives Amid Corruption Investigation**\nThe European Parliament has temporarily suspended access to its buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg for all lobbyists and representatives of the Chinese company Huawei, suspected of corruption within the EU institution to defend its interests. This is a 'precautionary measure' with 'immediate effect', said a Parliament spokesperson to AFP. The Chinese group currently has nine accredited representatives, according to the institution's transparency register, and therefore authorized to meet with MEPs. The decision comes after a wave of raids and arrests in a corruption investigation led by Belgian justice. The federal prosecutor's office in Belgium reported 21 searches carried out across the country and three more requested in Portugal. Lobbyists active for Huawei and parliamentary assistants suspected of having relayed requests for intervention with MEPs are in the crosshairs of investigators. Several arrests were made on Thursday, including one in France of a suspect targeted by a European arrest warrant issued by Belgian justice. However, no identity has been specified, nor the exact number of people arrested to be heard in Brussels. According to the prosecutor, corruption was practiced 'regularly' and 'very discreetly' since 2021, 'under the cover of commercial lobbying' and in different forms, such as remuneration for political positions or 'excessive gifts' like meal, travel or regular invitations to football matches. Thursday, seals were placed on the doors of several offices used by parliamentary assistants in both Brussels and Strasbourg. A former Slovenian MEP, whose name has circulated in the press as a potential suspect, has denied the accusations. Franc Bogovic, a former PPE (right) elected official, admitted to being invited by the Chinese group to conferences and participating with them in a project around high-speed internet, but assured he had no illegal behavior to reproach himself. In 2023, Brussels described the Chinese telecommunications giant as presenting the highest risk for EU countries among all 5G providers, calling on member states to exclude its equipment from their mobile networks. Last year, Germany announced its intention to ban the presence of Huawei and ZTE components and technologies in its 5G networks by the end of 2026 at the latest, citing 'security' reasons.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 03:57 PM\nSource:[Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/fil-dactualites/140325/corruption-le-parlement-europeen-suspend-ses-acces-aux-representants-de-huawei)\n\n**Belgian Police Raid Huawei Offices in European Parliament Lobbying Scandal**\nBelgian police launched a massive raid on Thursday, searching offices related to a European Parliament lobbying scandal, according to local media. The investigation, which involves Chinese tech giant Huawei, is focused on corruption and 'forgery and use of false documents' charges. Multiple suspects were taken in for questioning. The probe found that a secret lobbying campaign, disguised as 'business lobbying,' began in 2021, offering high salaries, luxury travel, and sports tickets to influence European politicians' decisions and benefit Huawei's interests in Europe. Belgian intelligence agencies conducted a two-year secret investigation before deciding to launch the raid. Huawei's offices in the EU and the residences of its lobbyists were searched. Huawei has remained silent, refusing to comment on the matter. Investigators are looking into around 15 former European parliamentarians, suspected of receiving money and high-end travel perks from Huawei in exchange for their support, especially when the company faced pressure from European regulatory bodies. The prosecution is also investigating potential money laundering, using conference fees to cover illicit funds. Huawei has been a contentious issue in Europe, with the EU Commission long urging member states to remove the company's 5G equipment. However, some countries have not fully implemented the ban. Last year, the EU's technology affairs commissioner criticized member states for not taking the issue seriously enough. The EU spokesperson has not commented on the scandal but again urged member states to accelerate their efforts to exclude Huawei. EU Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said, 'This is why, in our 2023 report, the Commission assessed Huawei's risks as far higher than those of other 5G suppliers. This is why the Commission believes that member states can make decisions to limit or exclude Huawei from their 5G networks. Now, we are certainly urging all member states to take action, because the lack of swift action will put the entire EU at risk.' This scandal has undoubtedly cast a shadow over EU-China relations. European Parliament's China affairs representative, El Olu, said, 'Europe's influence penetration by Beijing is already too familiar.' It seems that the 'Huawei Gate' will become another political storm within the EU.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 12:02 AM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2025/03/13/a103966908.html)\n\n**EU Parliament Embroiled in Huawei Corruption Scandal**\nThe EU Parliament is embroiled in a potential corruption scandal involving Huawei, a Chinese tech company. In Belgium and Portugal, police conducted house searches and made arrests, seizing documents to investigate allegations that EU parliamentarians were bribed by Huawei lobbyists and accepted gifts. According to the Brussels state prosecutor's office, around 100 police officers were involved in 21 house searches, with some parliamentarians and their assistants allegedly receiving money or gifts, including payments for political statements, invitations to football matches, or reimbursement of restaurant and travel expenses. The investigation focuses on whether attempts were made to influence political decisions through bribery, with the prosecutor's office not naming any individuals, but the newspaper Le Soir suggesting that Huawei lobbyists are involved. The scandal has been ongoing since 2021, with concerns about Huawei's 5G technology and its potential security risks. The EU and its member states have been debating the use of Huawei components in 5G networks, with Germany agreeing to remove them by 2026 and the UK and US already doing so. The EU Commission has called on Germany to improve its security measures.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 05:01 PM\nSource:[ComputerBase](https://www.computerbase.de/news/wirtschaft/eu-parlament-huawei-soll-in-moeglichen-korruptionsskandal-verwickelt-sein.91774/)\n\n**Huawei Embroiled in Bribery Scandal Involving European Parliament Members**\nBelgian federal prosecutors announced that police conducted searches at several locations in Belgium on March 13, 2025, related to bribery allegations against Huawei, a Chinese tech company. The investigation is focused on allegations that Huawei lobbyists provided bribes to European Parliament members, under the guise of lobbying, between 2021 and 2022. According to sources, around 15 former and current parliament members may be involved in the scandal. If the allegations against current parliament members are confirmed, the European Parliament may be asked to strip them of their immunity. A European Parliament spokesperson stated, 'We are aware of the information and will cooperate fully with the authorities if requested.' This is not the first time the European Parliament has faced corruption allegations, as some members were charged with bribery in 2022 for receiving bribes from Qatar and Morocco.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[KBS](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/pc/view/view.do?ncd=8199868)\n\n**Huawei Lobbyists Accused of Bribing European Lawmakers in Corruption Scandal**\nThe European Parliament is facing a new corruption scandal, according to an investigation by Follow the Money and two Belgian newspapers, Le Soir and Knack. The report claims that Huawei lobbyists paid bribes to European lawmakers to influence the EU's decision-making process. Sources say that around 15 current and former MEPs may be involved in the case. Police conducted secret raids on 21 homes on Thursday morning, searching for evidence of corruption, forgery, money laundering, and organized crime. Authorities also confiscated documents and electronic devices. No raids were conducted on the European Parliament premises. The investigation centers around Valerio Ottati, a 41-year-old Italian-Belgian lobbyist who has worked for Huawei for six years. Ottati previously worked for Italian MEPs involved in China-related dossiers. If the investigation involves current MEPs, Belgian authorities will ask the Parliament to revoke their immunity. 'The European Parliament takes note of the information. When requested, it always fully cooperates with the judicial authorities,' said an EU Parliament spokesperson. Euronews reports that there have been no raids on Parliament premises and no requests have been made to revoke immunity. However, the new scandal could be disastrous for the institution's reputation. The European Parliament strengthened its ethics and transparency rules after the Qatargate scandal in 2022, in which some MEPs accepted money and benefits from the Qatari state in exchange for influence on EU decisions.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 11:16 AM\nSource:[euronews](https://it.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/13/sospetta-corruzione-alleuroparlamento-perquisita-sede-huawei-coinvolto-litalo-belga-ottati)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts, there is a consensus that the probability of at least one resignation from the European Parliament before July 1, 2025 is significantly elevated due to the ongoing Huawei corruption scandal. Experts point to the severity and high-profile nature of the investigation, including arrests, immunity waiver proceedings for several MEPs, and mounting public/media attention as major factors increasing the likelihood of a resignation within the narrow three-week window following the European elections. While the historical base rate of resignations in this exact period is low, in analogous recent scandals (notably Qatargate), similar resignations occurred swiftly after legal or procedural triggers, especially if parliamentary immunity was removed or party pressure escalated. Constraints exist due to the potential for procedural delays\u2014immunity removals and resignations require committee and plenary votes which might lag beyond the cutoff date. Nonetheless, multiple experts stress that heightened institutional, legal, and reputational incentives (for both MEPs and party groups) raise the odds substantially. Probabilities assigned by the forecasters range from 43% to 83%, with most clustering between 60% and 83%. The most probable scenarios for a 'yes' resolution involve at least one implicated MEP stepping down in response to imminent legal jeopardy or overwhelming party/media pressure, while a 'no' outcome would depend on procedural delays or strategic deferral past July 1. Overall, the aggregation of expert judgment yields a moderate-to-high expectation of at least one resignation occurring within the timeframe due to the extraordinary and fast-moving context of the Huawei probe."
