Further, current diplomatic activity is focused in Istanbul, The Hague, and possibly other neutral venues\u2014not Russia. While Trump is highly unpredictable and could capitalize on a last-minute positive outcome (especially for a major legacy win), the required conditions are demanding, and there is little sign of an imminent or finalized settlement. Base rates for US presidential visits to Russia in wartime, or as the first diplomatic action after a breakthrough, are exceedingly low. Therefore, barring an extraordinary, rapid peace deal and the subsequent drive for a symbolic visit, the likelihood is significantly below 10%, but not so close to zero as to rule out a genuine Black Swan.

The critique from DiplomacyTrackOneDiplomacy and others correctly emphasizes that not only is the base rate vanishingly low, but every signal, norm, and logistical factor multiplies the friction. Trump's unpredictability as a variable does not sustainably overcome these barriers within the very short window left. The chance for a rapid, peace-induced reversal is not zero, but closer to 3-4%\u2014the Black Swan scenario is theoretically possible, but best not over-weighted.

Critiques of higher probabilities (like 7%) centered on the overweighting of 'Trump unpredictability' versus the immense friction of diplomatic, security, protocol, and alliance constraints. Defenses of very low forecasts (2-5%) were strong and compelling, especially from Russia specialists and intelligence methodologies, reinforcing the idea that while nonzero, the probability is best kept extremely low. The only plausible 'Yes' path runs through a dramatic, sudden peace breakthrough that is not indicated in the present news or diplomatic calendar.

Direct critiques point out that my initial 7% might actually be too generous, as the most expert, granular analyses (AreaStudiesRussiaRussiaUsRelationsStudies, SecurityStudiesNationalSecurityDecisionProcess) place the true risk at 2-4%. Nobody advanced a plausible mechanism for rapid reversal, and all base rates and signals situate this outcome in the very low single digits.

The only modest potential counterargument was that Trump's unpredictability or a 'shock' last-second summit could alter the inertia, but this tail risk was consistently and convincingly argued to be vanishingly small given the time frame, diplomatic alignment, and overwhelming institutional barriers. No compelling evidence or argument emerged during deliberation to warrant raising (or even reducing) the already low probability. My probabilistic reasoning is therefore unchanged.",

No new signals or overlooked evidence surfaced in the group argumentation to increase my estimate, and, if anything, the cool analytic discipline of I&W and Russia-focused experts cements the no scenario as profoundly dominant.

'Our delegation of negotiators will leave for Istanbul. And is ready from morning on Monday to continue the conversations, the second round of negotiations,' said Dmitry Peskov, in his daily telephone press conference. Russia proposed June 2 in Istanbul as the date and location for the meeting, which will follow the one held on May 16 in the same Turkish city. Both parties have confirmed that the memoranda of agreement they agreed to prepare after the telephone conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump on May 19 are ready. 'We expect both projects, the Russian and Ukrainian, to be addressed in the second round,' said Peskov. The same applies to the document with the conditions for a ceasefire declaration on the entire Russian-Ukrainian front. However, Ukraine insists that it wants to study the Russian memorandum before traveling to Istanbul to prepare a balanced response. Moscow considers these demands unjustified, which Kiev has interpreted as a new delaying tactic to continue the current offensive in the Donb\u00e1s and in northern Ukraine. Peskov also ruled out the presence of European representatives in Istanbul and a quick tripartite summit between Putin, Trump, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until the negotiations produce concrete results. However, he acknowledged that 'regardless, the future of European security will have to be discussed with the Europeans. It's inevitable.' The international press leaked that Russia wants the NATO to commit in writing to stop expanding towards Russian borders, i.e., to renounce the entry of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. Among the Russian demands for a ceasefire, Moscow demands that Western countries suspend arms supplies to Kiev, which agreed this week with Germany to jointly manufacture long-range armament.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 11:10 AM\nSource:[albertonews.com](https://albertonews.com/internacionales/negociadores-rusos-viajaran-a-estambul-el-lunes-mientras-ministro-turco-informa-a-kiev-de-sus-conversaciones-con-moscu/)\n\n**Yasuko Noda Visits Russia, Meets with Vladimir Putin**\nYasuko Noda, the widow of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visited Russia and met with President Vladimir Putin on May 29.

Despite Putin visiting Abe's hometown in 2016, the relationship between Japan and Russia has never warmed up and has deteriorated sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Yasuko Noda said that her husband had met with Putin over 27 times. She stated, 'My husband had hoped to meet with you even after the situation in Ukraine became challenging.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Russia is ready for a second round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul on June 2. Meanwhile, five aid workers from an international humanitarian organization were killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip, and two others were seriously injured. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov responded to Lavrov's proposal, saying that Kyiv is fully prepared for a complete and unconditional ceasefire with Russia. In other news, Casper Ruud was eliminated by Portugal's Nuno Borges in the second round of the 2025 French Open, and Ukrainian football club Shakhtar Donetsk appointed Arda Turan as their new head coach. The US Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority and blocked him from imposing sweeping global tariffs on imports.

US President Donald Trump stepped up rare criticism of President Vladmir Putin after Russia unleashed its biggest drone and missile attack to date in Ukraine. Trump called the Russian leader 'absolutely crazy' and warned that if Putin attempts to take over all of Ukraine, it will lead to the 'downfall' of Russia. Chinese electric carmaker BYD's price cuts of up to 35 percent fueled fears of a renewed price war in the highly competitive market of new energy vehicles, sending shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers plunging in Hong Kong trading. China's Ministry of Commerce and seven other agencies released a new plan to accelerate the development of 'smart' supply chains across sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, wholesale and retail. The plan aims to cut nationwide logistics costs and boost industrial resilience by promoting AI-powered smart factories, warehousing and retail systems. US President Donald Trump said his tariff policies are not aimed at encouraging domestic production of lower-cost, textile-related goods. 'I'm not looking to make T-shirts. I'm not looking to make socks,' he said. 'We want to make big things. We want to do the AI thing with computers. We are looking to do chips and computers, and tanks and ships.' The US dollar lost further ground against major world currencies after the Trump administration extended the deadline for 50 percent tariffs on the EU from June 1 to June 9. The euro rose as much as 0.55 percent against the dollar, and the yen added a quarter of a point against the greenback. The US dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major rivals, sank 0.3 percent after losing 2 percent last week, as concerns about rising US government debt caused some investors to flee dollar-denominated assets. Tripadvisor said about 8 percent of the 31 million reviews of travel sites and amenities submitted to the company in 2024 were fake, more than twice the number detected in 2022. Becky Foley, vice president of trust and safety at Tripadvisor, said the company's policing process means that not all the fake reviews were published. Some 7 percent of submissions in 2024 were auto-rejected before being posted and another 5 percent were referred to human review, she said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[shine.cn](https://www.shine.cn/china-biz-buzz/2505275645/)\n\n**Akie Abe's Rare Visit to Russia: A Move to Improve Relations?**\nThe widow of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Akie Abe, visited Russia and met with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on May 29. Putin expressed gratitude to Abe for his contributions to developing Russia-Japan cooperation and emphasized that he had not forgotten Abe's efforts. Putin and Abe had held 27 leader-level talks during Abe's tenure as prime minister. Putin presented flowers to Akie Abe at the Kremlin and she was visibly moved to tears during his speech. According to the Asahi Shimbun, Akie Abe received rare high-level treatment during her visit, which is seen as a move by Russia to improve relations with Japan. Japan has been subject to severe economic sanctions from the US and Europe due to its invasion of Ukraine. In December last year, former US President Donald Trump also hosted Akie Abe at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Akie Abe, 62, is not visiting Russia in an official capacity, and the Japanese government stated that it had not been in contact with her regarding the trip. In a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin said that Abe's dream was to conclude a peace treaty between Russia and Japan. Putin also stated that the relationship between the two countries has improved significantly and that they are no longer discussing the issue of a peace treaty. Putin invited Akie Abe to ride in his presidential limousine to the Bolshoi Theatre to watch a ballet performance. Putin had visited Abe's hometown of Yamaguchi Prefecture in 2016, but the relationship between Japan and Russia has never improved, and has deteriorated sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In a statement, Akie Abe said that her husband had always wanted to meet with Putin, even after the situation in Ukraine became challenging, but unfortunately, it was not possible due to circumstances and his life was cut short.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 04:13 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6809/8775623)\n\n**Russian Negotiators to Travel to Istanbul for Second Round of Peace Talks**\nRussian negotiators will travel to Istanbul on Monday to participate in the second round of peace talks, although Ukraine has not yet confirmed its presence.

According to US Special Representative Kita Kelllogg, the meeting is possible after the finalization of memoranda on conflict resolution in Ukraine. Although the US initially suggested the Vatican as a venue, Russia rejected the idea, calling it 'impolite'. Kelllogg mentioned Geneva as a possible location for the upcoming talks on Fox News. Zelensky confirmed his willingness to consider the proposal, while Putin expressed interest in discussing the resolution. However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noted that a final decision has not been made. Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov proposed Turkey as an alternative venue. India and Vietnam are also being considered as possible locations, given their diplomatic ties with both the US and Russia. Brazil and South Africa, as members of the BRICS, may also host the talks, offering their peace plans. Hungary and Slovakia, with good relations with Putin and Trump, could serve as European venues for the meeting, according to RBC. The Middle East is represented by Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, which have previously hosted talks on humanitarian issues and prisoner exchanges. Egypt, despite cancelled talks on strategic arms, remains a key candidate for hosting an international summit. International events, such as the BRICS summit in Brazil, the UN General Assembly in New York, and other international meetings in 2025, may serve as platforms for preliminary consultations. However, the outstanding arrest warrant for Putin issued by the International Criminal Court in 2023 remains a potential obstacle.

However, he is eager to visit Washington, a trip that was once a standard for German chancellors. But since Donald Trump's second inauguration as US President, the situation has changed, and there is a delay in scheduling a visit. The German government is waiting for a specific date, but so far, none has been set. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has already visited his US counterpart, but was not allowed to make a joint appearance with Marco Rubio before the press, according to Rubio. 'It was a courtesy visit,' Rubio said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Russia is ready for a second round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul on June 2. Meanwhile, five aid workers from an international humanitarian organization were killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip, and two others were seriously injured. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov responded to Lavrov's proposal, saying that Kyiv is fully prepared for a complete and unconditional ceasefire with Russia.

US President Donald Trump stepped up rare criticism of President Vladmir Putin after Russia unleashed its biggest drone and missile attack to date in Ukraine. Trump called the Russian leader 'absolutely crazy' and warned that if Putin attempts to take over all of Ukraine, it will lead to the 'downfall' of Russia. Chinese electric carmaker BYD's price cuts of up to 35 percent fueled fears of a renewed price war in the highly competitive market of new energy vehicles, sending shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers plunging in Hong Kong trading. China's Ministry of Commerce and seven other agencies released a new plan to accelerate the development of 'smart' supply chains across sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, wholesale and retail. The plan aims to cut nationwide logistics costs and boost industrial resilience by promoting AI-powered smart factories, warehousing and retail systems. US President Donald Trump said his tariff policies are not aimed at encouraging domestic production of lower-cost, textile-related goods. 'I'm not looking to make T-shirts. I'm not looking to make socks,' he said. 'We want to make big things. We want to do the AI thing with computers. We are looking to do chips and computers, and tanks and ships.' The US dollar lost further ground against major world currencies after the Trump administration extended the deadline for 50 percent tariffs on the EU from June 1 to June 9. The euro rose as much as 0.55 percent against the dollar, and the yen added a quarter of a point against the greenback. The US dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major rivals, sank 0.3 percent after losing 2 percent last week, as concerns about rising US government debt caused some investors to flee dollar-denominated assets. Tripadvisor said about 8 percent of the 31 million reviews of travel sites and amenities submitted to the company in 2024 were fake, more than twice the number detected in 2022. Becky Foley, vice president of trust and safety at Tripadvisor, said the company's policing process means that not all the fake reviews were published. Some 7 percent of submissions in 2024 were auto-rejected before being posted and another 5 percent were referred to human review, she said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[shine.cn](https://www.shine.cn/china-biz-buzz/2505275645/)\n\n**Trump to Visit Russia After Conflict Resolution**\nUS President Donald Trump is expected to visit Russia, according to Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov.

According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the trip aims to 'strengthen bilateral ties with these countries through high-level meetings and encounters.' Although the agenda is not detailed, the meetings are expected to focus on regional security, energy cooperation, and strategic trade relations. The visit takes on added significance in the context of the discreet peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, which are being held in Saudi Arabia. These talks aim to achieve a ceasefire following Russia's 2022 invasion and the ongoing occupation of eastern Ukraine since 2014. White House officials have confirmed that special envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Russia this week to continue the talks. 'President Trump has expressed his frustration with both sides of the conflict and reiterated his desire to end the war,' Leavitt said. Trump had promised during his election campaign to secure a peace agreement within days, but this goal remains unfulfilled as he approaches his 100th day in office.

    "summary": "All experts assign a very low probability to Donald Trump visiting Russia before July 1, 2025. Across the diverse domains\u2014diplomacy, intelligence analysis, security studies, political science, international relations, and area studies\u2014forecasters consistently cite as decisive factors: (1) explicit public and private statements from both U.S. and Russian officials making any Trump visit contingent on a resolution or major progress in the Ukraine conflict; (2) the lack of any breakthrough agreement as of late May 2025 and the fact that negotiations and potential summits are being held, or discussed, in neutral venues such as Istanbul, not Russia; (3) extremely low historical base rates of U.S. presidents visiting Russia during periods of open military conflict involving Russia and a nation supported by the U.S.; (4) substantial domestic and alliance-related political risks for Trump appearing in Russia without a peace deal; (5) the absence of leaks, official announcements, or credible indicators of planning for a Russia trip in the month remaining. Several forecasters note Trump\u2019s unpredictability as a marginal tail risk, and acknowledge a very unlikely scenario in which a last-minute peace breakthrough could prompt a rapid, symbolic visit to Moscow, but emphasize that there is no sign of such a breakthrough or trip preparation underway. Final probabilities assigned by experts range from 2% to 7%, with nearly all clustering between 2% and 5%. The dominant expert consensus is that a Trump trip to Russia before July 1, 2025, is highly improbable barring an extraordinary and currently unexpected diplomatic breakthrough in Ukraine."
