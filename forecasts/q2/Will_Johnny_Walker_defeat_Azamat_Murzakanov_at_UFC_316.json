Walker reportedly has had multiple bouts withdrawn due to injury or other issues in recent years, and there is no evidence he will return to this card. From a psychological lens, even if Walker were briefly considered, the lack of preparation time would be an extraordinary strain on mental resilience for both him and Murzakanov, further reducing the viability. Given the official nature of the withdrawal and the proximity to the event, the probability Walker fights Murzakanov at UFC 316 is near 0%.",

'I'm feeling very relaxed about my upcoming rematch, but I know Sean O'Malley will change his strategy. This fight will be financially beneficial for me, as O'Malley is the most popular fighter in the division. I think he'll start with body shots, for example. After the rematch, I want to stay active. I'm planning to have two more fights this year, maybe in Guadalajara and New York. I'm in good shape and want to stay busy to avoid distractions,' Dvalishvili said. The title fight between O'Malley and Dvalishvili will headline UFC 316, which will take place on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey.

O'Malley is set to face current bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 316 on June 9 in New Jersey, USA. This will be a rematch for the two fighters.

Dvalishvili shared a photo of his foot on Instagram, joking, 'It's okay, I'll just cut it off.' This is not the first time Dvalishvili has suffered an injury before a big fight, but he has always managed to push through. The injury occurred during a sparring session with undefeated boxer Cameron Sandoval. Dvalishvili joked, 'Why did you break my little toe, friend?' Sandoval replied, 'You did! You kicked me in the head and broke your own toe. It's your fault.' Although both fighters took the incident lightly, it could potentially affect the UFC 316 event. If Dvalishvili is forced to withdraw, the UFC would need to find a new main event at short notice. Dvalishvili previously defeated O'Malley in September, dominating the fight with a unanimous decision. He also defeated Umar Nurmagomedov in January, who was considered a major threat. However, Dvalishvili's foot injury may now threaten his chances of winning against O'Malley at UFC 316.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 25, 2025 10:38 AM\nSource:[as](https://as.com/masdeporte/polideportivo/merab-preocupa-con-una-lesion-a-dos-semanas-del-ufc-316-n/)\n\n**Merab Dvalishvili comes clean on rematching \"humble\" Sean O'Malley at UFC 316**\nMerab Dvalishvili is set to defend his bantamweight title against Sean O'Malley at UFC 316 on June 7. Dvalishvili, who dominated O'Malley in their first fight at UFC 306, is aiming for a definitive finish in the rematch. According to Dvalishvili, O'Malley has become 'humble' and is no longer talking disrespectfully, but Dvalishvili is looking to win with even more dominance. Dvalishvili's coach, John Wood, believes that the rematch will be 'tricky' due to O'Malley's likely adjustments, but is confident in Dvalishvili's skill set to overcome any new challenges.

However, Yan is being considered for a fight against Marcus McGee, and it's unclear if he will accept the fight. Another option is Song Yadong, who is scheduled to fight Rob Font in August, but it's unclear if he will be able to recover and prepare for a fight with Umar in October. Other potential opponents for Umar include Dvalishvili's opponent in their previous fight, Sean O'Malley, but this is unlikely. Umar's other options include a fight against Patrick Mix, who is making his UFC debut at UFC 316, or a fight against Davison Figueiredo, who is recovering from an injury.

This fight will be financially beneficial for me, as O'Malley is the most popular fighter in the division. I think he'll start with body shots, for example. After the rematch, I want to stay active.

Dvalishvili shared a photo of his foot on Instagram, joking, 'It's okay, I'll just cut it off.' This is not the first time Dvalishvili has suffered an injury before a big fight, but he has always managed to push through. The injury occurred during a sparring session with undefeated boxer Cameron Sandoval. Dvalishvili joked, 'Why did you break my little toe, friend?' Sandoval replied, 'You did! You kicked me in the head and broke your own toe. It's your fault.' Although both fighters took the incident lightly, it could potentially affect the UFC 316 event. If Dvalishvili is forced to withdraw, the UFC would need to find a new main event at short notice. Dvalishvili previously defeated O'Malley in September, dominating the fight with a unanimous decision. He also defeated Umar Nurmagomedov in January, who was considered a major threat.

    "summary": "All experts unanimously forecast that Johnny Walker will not defeat Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316, assigning a probability of 0% or, at most, 1% for a Yes outcome. Across perspectives as varied as mixed martial arts coaching, sports betting analysis, historical fight data, sports science, biomechanics, and sports psychology, every expert points to the confirmed withdrawal of Johnny Walker from the event, as reported by multiple reputable MMA news outlets and UFC event listings. Brendson Ribeiro is now set to face Murzakanov at UFC 316. The experts all note that reversal of such late-stage, officially promoted withdrawals is historically almost unprecedented in UFC practice. Given the strict resolution criteria\u2014that Walker must both fight and defeat Murzakanov at this specific event\u2014all plausible scenarios and available media corroborate that Walker will not compete in the bout, making a Yes resolution all but impossible. Only extremely remote, hypothetically unlikely tail risks (such as a cascade of additional withdrawals and last-minute reinstatement) are acknowledged by a minority of experts, and even then, these probabilities are placed at less than 1%. Therefore, the consensus is that the probability Johnny Walker defeats Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 is effectively zero."
