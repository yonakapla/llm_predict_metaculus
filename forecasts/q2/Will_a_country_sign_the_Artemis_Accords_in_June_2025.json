Baku Energy Week offers a near-term, high-visibility diplomatic stage. Moreover, the expansion to Bangladesh signals that the US outreach is targeting more diverse and less space-intensive states, possibly as symbolic or alliance-building gestures. Geopolitical turbulence (Middle East, EU rifts) could slow progress, but has not stalled forward momentum this year. Given all this, the likelihood that at least one (likely minor to mid-tier) country will sign in June remains strong, though not quite certain.

June is a high-activity period for international diplomacy, with multiple stories noting big multinational gatherings and energetic regional engagement.

No major domestic or international shock appears to threaten further signings imminently. Consequently, the history of regular signings, high salience international engagement in early June, and lack of negative signals make it probable that at least one new country joins the Artemis Accords in June 2025. However, the effect of diminishing pool is non-trivial, so not at the most extreme probability. I forecast: ",

The sharply higher probabilities (over 70%) advocated by some seem excessively optimistic given the thinning pool and lack of concrete rumors, but their arguments for a still-strong pipeline suggest that a modest upward nudge from my prior 67% is warranted. In sum: the chance that the June window passes with zero signings is not trivial, but the ongoing trend and context of diplomatic opportunity outweigh the slowdown signal.",

The case will be heard in the Netherlands, with the support of the German law firm SGP Schneider Geiwitz, which has successfully led previous lawsuits against the platform. The initiative is based on a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on September 19, 2024, which declared illegal the contractual parity clauses imposed by Booking.com on hotels for the past 20 years. These clauses forced accommodations to match prices and availability offered on the platform on all other channels, including their own websites, restricting competition, increasing costs, and limiting commercial autonomy. Hotels can claim compensation for commissions paid to Booking.com between 2004 and 2024, plus interest. The claim is open to all affected hotels, which can join the collective action through the designated platform. In Spain, the Spanish Hotel and Tourism Accommodation Confederation (CEHAT) has signed an agreement with CCS Abogados to facilitate the adhesion of its members. Due to the peculiarities of the Spanish judicial system, hotels can choose to join the main collective action in the Netherlands or file their claim in Spain, coordinated with other countries. The action is supported by the following national associations: IHA (Germany), APHA (Austria), F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Horeca Bruxelles and Horeca Vlaanderen (Belgium), UPUHH (Croatia), CHA (Cyprus), AHR CR (Czech Republic), HORESTA (Denmark), AHRS (Slovakia), TGZS (Slovenia), EHRA (Estonia), MaRa (Finland), HCH (Greece), HHRA (Hungary), IHF (Ireland), SAF (Iceland), FEDERALBERGHI (Italy), AHRL (Latvia), LHGV (Liechtenstein), LVRA (Lithuania), HORESCA (Luxembourg), NHO Reiseliv (Norway), KHN (Netherlands), IGHP (Poland), APHORT (Portugal), FIHR (Romania), and HOTELLERIESUISSE (Switzerland).

The document, signed by 20 EU countries, urges Hungary to 'reconsider its measures' and encourages the European Commission to take 'full and rapid' action to address the issue.

The new model will provide full state funding for targeted subsidies to teachers only to municipalities with school networks meeting the established criteria for student numbers, set by the Ministry of Education and Science (MON). The reform aims to address the current system's inequality, where teacher salary increases depend on the number of children in municipalities. The MON estimates that an additional 35.7 million euros will be needed for the reform next year, and 107.24 million euros annually from 2027 onwards. The additional funding for 2026 and beyond will be considered during the budget law development process. The Saeima still needs to approve the amendments.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 01:09 PM\nSource:[RUS TVNET](https://rus.tvnet.lv/8256958/s-oseni-sleduyushchego-goda-budet-vnedrena-novaya-sistema-finansirovaniya-obrazovaniya)\n\n**Eurispes Report: Citizens' Trust in Institutions Declines, Except for the President**\nA recent Eurispes report shows a decline in citizens' trust in the country's institutions, with the exception of the President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella, whose approval rating increased from 60.8% in 2024 to 63.6% in 2025.

Starting from September 2025, the updated rules for confirming the type of activity that affects the tariff for workers' injury insurance will come into force. Now, there is no need to submit information, and the data on codes from companies, entrepreneurs, and Rosstat will be accumulated in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities and Individual Entrepreneurs (EGRUL) and the Unified State Register of Real Estate (EGRIP). The Social Fund will assess whether the main type of activity of the company corresponds to the one declared, and whether a tariff change is required. In connection with the new regulations, the Cabinet has approved the order for determining the OKVED codes by the Decree of May 27, 2025 No. 728. According to the document, starting from September 1, 2025, Rosstat and the Social Fund will determine the main and additional codes of the reporting type and calculate the percentage shares of business types of companies and IP as follows: they will consider all types of business for a year with a detail of not less than 4 digits of the OKVED code. For commercial companies, excluding companies in the insurance and financial sectors, the following parameters will be used: turnover: by services, works, and goods in breakdown by types of non-trading business; for the trade sector - gross profit by types of business. If a company conducts both trade and other business, the percentage shares of such businesses will be calculated by summing up the data by parameters. It is also indicated which parameters are used for IP and NKO, and what stages the process of determining the main code and additional codes includes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 08:12 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https://finance.rambler.ru/business/54744003-travmvznosy-kabmin-reglamentiroval-kak-budut-opredelyat-osnovnoy-i-dopolnitelnye-okved/)\n\n**Baku Energy Week to Host 267 Companies from 39 Countries**\nThis year's Baku Energy Week will host 267 companies from 39 countries, according to Naile Aliyeva, project manager of Iteca Caspian.

The four European countries reiterated their commitment to the two-state solution. According to a joint statement by the four countries, the meeting of the 'Madrid+' group aims to renew and strengthen the international commitment to the two-state solution. The statement emphasized that a viable and geographically connected Palestinian state, within internationally recognized borders, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and with East Jerusalem as its capital, is the only way to achieve peace and security and meet the legitimate national aspirations of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. The statement also noted that the implementation of the two-state solution and recognition of Palestine as a state after years of stagnation is not only an ethical but also a crucial step towards reviving momentum towards the implementation of this solution. The four countries called on all members of the international community to take practical steps to implement the two-state solution, including individual recognition of the Palestinian and Israeli states by countries that have not yet done so, support for Palestine's full membership in the United Nations, and promoting a path that ultimately leads to a final agreement based on mutual recognition between the two sides. Ireland, Norway, Slovenia, and Spain also emphasized that the upcoming conference on the Palestinian issue, scheduled for June 17, 2024, under the auspices of the United Nations and co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is not just a legitimate international event but also a suitable framework for moving forward with the implementation of the two-state solution. In May 2024, Norway, Ireland, and Spain officially recognized Palestine as a state, effective from May 28, 2024. Prior to this development, eight European Union member states had recognized Palestine, including Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, the Romanian Cypriot administration, and Sweden. 'The Madrid+' group was established to support Palestine against ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza, and it includes several European, Arab, and Islamic countries, including Spain, Norway, Slovenia, Ireland, Turkey, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Bahrain. Palestine is a non-member observer state in the United Nations, according to a UN General Assembly resolution on November 29, 2012. Since October 7, 2023, Israel, backed by the US, has been committing a genocide in Gaza, resulting in over 177,000 Palestinians killed or injured, mostly children and women, and over 11,000 missing, in addition to hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Concurrently, the Israeli army and settlers have escalated their attacks in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, resulting in the deaths of at least 972 Palestinians and the injury of over 7,000, as well as the arrest of over 17,000, according to Palestinian statistics. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 12:49 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/5/29/4-%d8%af%d9%88%d9%84-%d8%a3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%af%d8%b9%d9%88-%d9%84%d9%85%d9%86%d8%ad-%d9%81%d9%84%d8%b3%d8%b7%d9%8a%d9%86-%d8%b9%d8%b6%d9%88%d9%8a%d8%a9)\n\n**Important Deadlines and Tax Information for June 2025**\nImportant deadlines and tax information for June 2025.

The funds are allocated through a government decree as an additional expense in the ministry's budget. The necessary financial resources are secured by deducting from the planned expenses in the central budget for 2025, which is at least 1.8 billion levs, to settle debts from 2024. The exact breakdown of the funds is not clear, but it is mentioned that 238 million levs will be allocated for indexing and railway projects. Additionally, the decree allows for the payment of completed activities under contracts for the re-measurement of the state levelling network and the creation of a cadastral map and cadastral registers.\nOriginal language: bg\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 04:44 PM\nSource:[economic.bg](https://www.economic.bg/bg/a/view/ms-pogasjava-blizo-polovin-miliard-ot-zadyljenijata-na-api-kym-pytni-firmi)\n\n**EU Countries Condemn Hungary's Constitutional Changes**\nTwenty European Union countries have signed a document condemning Hungary's recent constitutional changes, which prioritize the 'correct physical, intellectual, and moral development' of children over other fundamental rights.

The document, signed by 20 EU countries, urges Hungary to 'reconsider its measures' and encourages the European Commission to take 'full and rapid' action to address the issue.

The new model will provide full state funding for targeted subsidies to teachers only to municipalities with school networks meeting the established criteria for student numbers, set by the Ministry of Education and Science (MON). The reform aims to address the current system's inequality, where teacher salary increases depend on the number of children in municipalities. The MON estimates that an additional 35.7 million euros will be needed for the reform next year, and 107.24 million euros annually from 2027 onwards. The additional funding for 2026 and beyond will be considered during the budget law development process.

The statement reaffirms the importance of the ICC's work in promoting accountability and upholding international law, and calls on countries to support the court's efforts to ensure its independence and effectiveness. The signatory countries include Afghanistan, Albania, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belize, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cape Verde, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Comoros, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Maldives, Malta, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Namibia, Netherlands, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Moldova, Romania, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, State of Palestine, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu. The statement comes after US President Donald Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on ICC officials, citing 'unlawful actions' against the US and Israel. The order bans ICC officials and their families from entering the US and freezes their assets. The ICC had issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November for 'war crimes against Palestinians.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[raya.ps](https://www.raya.ps/news/1189590.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts, there is a strong consensus that a country is likely to sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025, with final probabilities assigned ranging from 62% to 77%. Experts base their reasoning primarily on the steady historical base rate of approximately one new signatory per month\u2014recent additions (Bangladesh in April and Norway in May) sustain this momentum. Factors increasing the probability include ongoing US diplomatic outreach, June's busy calendar of international events (especially Baku Energy Week), and the low cost/signaling benefits for smaller or emerging nations. However, all experts note a slightly declining chance due to the 'shrinking pool' effect: most obvious and willing states have already signed, leaving a thinner field of potential joiners, many of whom are less inclined or are aligned with rival blocs. There is also recognition of geopolitical crosswinds, such as broader tensions around the US and its initiatives, but these are not seen as sufficient to significantly dampen momentum. Experts agree that while no specific imminent signing is publicly indicated, historical patterns, diplomatic opportunity, and the incentives at play make a new signature in June probable, with scenario descriptions focusing on a smaller or emerging economy leveraging a diplomatic event as the likely pathway."
