An effective last-week narrative or mini-scandal on Cuomo keeps moderate turnout low, and city liberals prioritize change over perceived experience.",

Progressive energy splits slightly among minor candidates or stays among lower-propensity voters who do not turn out en masse.

Cuomo's campaign, with a base among reliable older, Orthodox, and Black voters and establishment resources, is well-placed to withstand a surge\u2014especially given the NYC Democratic primary's overall demographics and turnout patterns. However, the ranked-choice system creates meaningful risk: historically, rapid late surges plus strong second-choice appeal can produce upsets (as seen in Chesa Boudin's SF DA race or Kendra Horn's Oklahoma Democratic upset). Voter targeting models suggest that while Mamdani has the ingredients for a late upset, his base's turnout reliability (24-and-under, highly progressive, less affluent, more transient) is modest compared to Cuomo's. No evidence yet of a field-wide big consolidation toward Mamdani (Lander/Stringer still running). Barring a last-minute bombshell or landslide turnout shift, Cuomo is likelier than not to win, but the race is tight \u2014 so I rate it at 72%, reflecting moderate but not overwhelming confidence given RCV unpredictability and NYC's history of surprise left upsets.",

However, Mamdani's late momentum is real, and his coalition might reach a tipping point in RCV if progressive turnout surges and consolidation continues. With two weeks left, the status quo still narrowly favors Cuomo, but the race is quite fluid. From an opposition research standpoint, no new nuclear revelations about Cuomo seem imminent, and the anti-Mamdani attacks are likely to have already landed or been countered at this point, so major swings from oppo seem less likely.

Past field examples (AOC, Bowman) show that when the system is under stress from grassroots campaigning, microtargeting loses predictive power and campaign 'modelling' looks in the rearview mirror. Your 72% would be reasonable for a sleepy, demographically stable race, but in a live contest where movement spillover and non-linear turnout shifts are live threats, your model risks missing the tsunami for the segment. For a contest this fluid, you need more humility and a better sociological lens."

You\u2019re treating the sample breakdowns and subgroup weights as if they represent unchangeable facts, refusing to seriously reckon with the effect that a sustained digital, activist-led push can have on who actually shows up. In city history, we've seen both the machine and the progressive waves surprise pollsters precisely because last-minute energy shifts which subgroups are disproportionately represented. Ranked-choice voting makes second-choice math\u2014and the potential for a progressive coalition around Mamdani\u2014much more treacherous for establishment models.

No new evidence, polling, or strategic bombshell has emerged in this discussion to justify sharply downgrading or boosting Cuomo's probability.

On the other hand, most forecasters still cluster in the 68-77% range for Cuomo; only my estimate and perhaps a handful of nuanced movement-oriented arguments place higher risk on an upset. However, no one makes a compelling case that Mamdani has clearly overtaken Cuomo\u2019s coalition or is favored yet. The polling gap has not fully closed, Mamdani\u2019s path hinges on an even larger turnout/joining of anti-Cuomo votes than currently demonstrated, and no last-minute scandal or oppo event seems likely (though never impossible in NYC). Weighing the argument that rapid last-minute volatility is possible but not yet proven to be likely in quantitative terms, I will nudge my probability very slightly higher to recognize the weight of establishment models, but keep it well below the 70+ consensus to reflect genuine, unique late-breaking risk.",

(3) While there is legitimate uncertainty and RCV could still yield an upset if the progressive coalition almost perfectly consolidates, the closing polling gap still shows Cuomo clearly ahead. I also agree more strongly now that the floor for establishment voters in this environment remains sturdy unless a new scandal or true mayoral field consolidation unfolds. In sum, the critiques introduce real, but not dominant, risk. My recalibrated judgment is that Cuomo's probability is a bit less secure than my initial estimate due to RCV and turnout volatility, but only by a marginal amount.

There was little evidence cited for a genuine late-breaking scandal or for Mamdani closing the polling gap fully. The most insightful interventions reinforced that, even with digital activism and microtargeted progressive organizing, the historical success rate for late surges falls short unless turnout truly transcends prior cycles. Notably, no case was made for an odds shift below 65% or above 77%.

In a recent debate, the promise to safeguard the immigrant community weighed heavily. This comes as ICE raids continue under the Trump administration. The nine candidates agreed on one point: they will not comply with Trump's mass deportation policies. This issue has been central to the local and national debate on immigration. With nearly 40% of New York's population being foreign-born, the topic is of great importance to voters. In the first debate of the primaries, Democratic candidates showed unity on a key issue: protecting immigrants from ICE raids. In a tense political environment, marked by Trump's pressure on local governments to collaborate with his immigration plan, the mayoral hopefuls rejected any attempt to cooperate with federal deportation policies. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who leads in the polls, stated without hesitation that New York will not cave to Trump's demands. 'You can't cave to Mr. Trump and his demands,' Cuomo said. Zohran Mamdani, state legislator and another top contender, went further, denouncing that the city is 'under attack from an authoritarian Trump administration.' Mamdani, who appears to be the most progressive candidate in the contest, also received support from figures like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been a defender of immigrant rights. New York is one of the sanctuary cities in the United States, meaning its local policies do not collaborate with federal authorities on immigration issues. The Democratic candidates have promised to defend that designation, reiterating that they will not allow ICE raids without restrictions in the city. During the debate, Brad Lander, New York's comptroller, highlighted his support for sanctuary city laws, emphasizing the importance of resisting Trump's attempts to force cities to collaborate with immigration policies. The protection of immigrants has been especially important, given the arrival of over 230,000 asylum seekers in the city since spring 2022. Despite criticism of the current mayor, Eric Adams, who has been accused of collaborating with the federal government on migration issues, the Democratic candidates promised to strengthen laws protecting immigrants, ensuring that New York remains a safe refuge.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 08, 2025 09:01 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/datos-estados-unidos/2025/06/08/elecciones-nueva-york-candidatos-democratas-prometen-proteccion-a-inmigrantes-perseguidos-por-ice-lrtmusv-778280)\n\n**Meet the 12 NYC Mayoral candidates: What they stand for in the 2025 race - Times of India**\nThe 2025 New York City mayoral election is heating up with several candidates vying for the position.

Mamdani, who appears to be the most progressive candidate in the contest, also received support from figures like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been a defender of immigrant rights. New York is one of the sanctuary cities in the United States, meaning its local policies do not collaborate with federal authorities on immigration issues. The Democratic candidates have promised to defend that designation, reiterating that they will not allow ICE raids without restrictions in the city. During the debate, Brad Lander, New York's comptroller, highlighted his support for sanctuary city laws, emphasizing the importance of resisting Trump's attempts to force cities to collaborate with immigration policies. The protection of immigrants has been especially important, given the arrival of over 230,000 asylum seekers in the city since spring 2022. Despite criticism of the current mayor, Eric Adams, who has been accused of collaborating with the federal government on migration issues, the Democratic candidates promised to strengthen laws protecting immigrants, ensuring that New York remains a safe refuge.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 08, 2025 09:01 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/datos-estados-unidos/2025/06/08/elecciones-nueva-york-candidatos-democratas-prometen-proteccion-a-inmigrantes-perseguidos-por-ice-lrtmusv-778280)\n\n**Meet the 12 NYC Mayoral candidates: What they stand for in the 2025 race - Times of India**\nThe 2025 New York City mayoral election is heating up with several candidates vying for the position.

Mamdani, who represents Queens, gained traction with strong fundraising, progressive policies, and viral social media content. He is focusing on housing, public transit, and economic justice to win over voters. Mamdani, a democratic socialist inspired by Bernie Sanders, is in favour of free city bus rides, rent freezes, city-owned groceries, and a $30 minimum wage by 2030. He has sponsored 20 bills, three of which have become law, and has been a leading member of the Democratic Socialists of America since 2017.

    "summary": "Across a range of expert perspectives\u2014including political campaign strategy, polling science, media analysis, retrospective and party identification models, urban sociology, social movement theory, and NYC political history\u2014the consensus is that Andrew Cuomo remains the probabilistic favorite to win the 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor. Experts draw this conclusion based on Cuomo's consistent single-digit lead in ranked-choice voting simulations (generally 8-12 points), strong name recognition, and entrenched support from high-turnout blocs (elder, Black, Orthodox Jewish, and moderate Democratic voters), as well as influential establishment endorsements. \n\nHowever, all experts highlight Zohran Mamdani's rapidly growing momentum: he has closed the gap by more than 20 points over several weeks and now leads Cuomo in second-choice support, a dynamic amplified by NYC's ranked-choice voting system. Mamdani's strong grassroots mobilization, progressive endorsements (notably from AOC), and effective coalition-building could further erode Cuomo's lead if late-stage trends and turnout among progressives and younger voters continue to exceed historic norms. Factors that could tip the race include: further consolidation among progressive and anti-Cuomo voters in lower-choice rounds, an unforeseen late-breaking scandal or high-profile endorsement, or a dramatic spike in turnout among underrepresented groups.\n\nDespite these risks and the city\u2019s history of occasional progressive upsets, the structural, demographic, and base-rate factors still favor Cuomo. Most experts assign Cuomo a probability of winning between 65% and 77%, reflecting moderate confidence but clear recognition of significant (roughly 1-in-4 to 1-in-3) upset risk. The expert community converges: Cuomo is ahead, but the closing margin and underlying volatility mean Mamdani cannot be ruled out\u2014Cuomo is the favorite, but not a lock."
