On the other hand, defenses of mid-high probabilities (in the high 70s/low 80s) and especially the campaign management viewpoint raised a valid point: with robust campaign resources, a clear coalition, and a mobilized core bloc, Jones is slightly more favored than my original probability. Specifically, the sociological and campaign-management perspectives suggest that the field/GOTV advantage is material and should properly bump the probability up a few points, absent real evidence of a late Taylor surge or gamechanger.

The consensus suggests the 70s-to-low 80s is appropriate; group-focused sociological frameworks and campaign strategy perspectives both reinforce a slight caution due to turnout unpredictability. Given that Taylor has viable regional/professional bases, and with early voting already underway, my assessment is confirmed.

Several forecasters independently validated that fundraising and name ID are strong base rate predictors, but the most persuasive exchanges (notably with Sociological and Public Opinion perspectives) highlight the risks of overconfidence in a low-turnout, highly identity-driven context. Some regional and institutional forecasters seem overconfident, assigning probabilities upwards of 85-90% and dismissing the volatility of such primaries\u2014volatility that is especially pronounced if a counter-coalition of suburban/professional Democratic women and local networks activates around Taylor late. However, the absence of credible evidence for a Taylor surge, and continuing signals in the news of Jones\u2019s fundraising and network dominance, reinforce him as a strong favorite. Nevertheless, prudent forecasting should better accommodate tail risks: a last-minute mobilization, a late-breaking scandal or identity-based backlash. I am marginally raising my estimate to reflect continued confidence in Jones's core-group turnout advantage (in line with most data-focused forecasters, though remaining shy of the most extreme probabilities), but I decline to inch higher given the real-world risks discussed.",

Some experts are more cautious, emphasizing low-turnout volatility, lack of public polling, and the possibility of late Taylor momentum among suburban/activist women, while others are more aggressive, citing strong fundraising and historic performance by establishment candidates. My critique and defense in discussion reaffirmed that the coalition/network effects and Jones\u2019s resource advantage are decisive, but the consistent theme across group input is that absolute certainty is unwarranted and that races with this profile can occasionally surprise, especially where polling is absent. No persuasive evidence or new developments appear to warrant a strong move in either direction.

There\u2019s also legitimate concern that a motivated cluster among suburban/professional women, or anti-machine sentiment, could combine with a small field to shrink Jones's margin. Still, the overall consensus, especially from microtargeting and sociological analysis, reaffirms Jones's substantial edge.

Second, multiple campaign and political science forecasters argued, persuasively, against overconfidence in my original forecast by stressing the 'black box' nature of the current race\u2014no public polling and minimal visibility into late field activity. The critiques also sharpened the risk of a localized, regionally intense surge (e.g., professional/prosecutorial/Richmond-based Democrats, women post-Roe) and the possibility of late, unmeasured activism against establishment candidates.

The district, which has been historically Democratic, flipped red in 2023 when Marmorato narrowly defeated Council Member Marjorie Vel\u00e1zquez. Democrats argue that Marmorato's win was not a mandate for her policies, but rather a rebuke of her predecessor's inconsistency and absence in the community. Six Democratic candidates have emerged in the race, each with deep roots to the district and a message aimed at building trust. They include Aldebol, who has secured endorsements from the Bronx Democratic Party and several major labor groups; Rivera, a former Vice Chair of the Bronx party and current executive director of Servicing Our Youth; and Diaz, a City Island civic volunteer running a grassroots campaign focused on constituent services and government transparency. The candidates are prioritizing community service and reengaging disillusioned voters, with some criticizing the city's handling of the migrant crisis and the decline in trust and credibility of the Democratic leadership.

Among Republicans, former FBI agent Mike Van Meter has indicated he wants a second shot at the seat, despite drawing only 34% of the vote against Connolly last year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 07:57 PM\nSource:[newsmax.com](https://www.newsmax.com/john-gizzi/gerry-connolly-death-democrats/2025/05/22/id/1212046/)\n\n**In Virginia\u2019s 100th House District, Democrats choose their fighter**\nIn Virginia's 100th House District, Democrats have chosen Liz Richardson as their nominee to challenge Del. Rob Bloxom in November. Rocco DeBellis, a personal chef to Judge Judy, stepped down from the race, and if no other Democrats enter by Saturday, Richardson will be the nominee. Richardson, a local resident and rural advocate, educator, and chaplain, aims to represent the district, which includes a portion of Virginia Beach and the Eastern Shore. DeBellis, who also teaches boxing, said, 'I think she would definitely be a better candidate.' Richardson stated, 'Too often, rural voices are left out of policy conversations that directly impact their lives.' She plans to 'shape the future of Virginia in a way that uplifts all of our people \u2014 especially those who\u2019ve been overlooked for too long.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 21, 2025 06:39 PM\nSource:[pilotonline.com](https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/05/21/virginia-house-district-100-race/)\n\n**Early voting has started for the June primaries.

Taylor, a longtime prosecutor from Henrico County, emphasizes her experience as a commonwealth's attorney and her ability to investigate and prosecute cases independently. Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk, highlights his experience as an assistant attorney general in Washington, D.C. and his commitment to expanding certain units within the attorney general's office, such as a civil rights unit and a labor justice unit. Both candidates are running on anti-Trump platforms and say Virginia should have challenged the administration's executive orders, which they claim have resulted in the state losing out on millions of dollars in research funding.

The state is holding elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) is seeking to cement his legacy by helping the GOP win, but his close ties to Donald Trump's policies may hinder his efforts. The lieutenant governor's race between Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R) and former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger (D) is a key matchup that could result in Virginia's first female governor. Voters can participate in either party's primary without party registration, but not both.

Governor primary for health reasons, the Republican ticket is now set with Winsome Earle-Sears for governor, John Reid for Lt. Governor, and Jason Miyares for reelection as Attorney General. This ticket is considered far-right and extreme, with Winsome Earle-Sears making several controversial comments, including comparing Brown v. Board to the quest for taxpayer-funded segregated academies, and stating that the mother is not having a lizard, she's having a human being. Democrats are calling on Republicans to disavow Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears' comments on the Richmond shooting, and EMILY's List has criticized her for spewing misinformation about reproductive rights. Former VA Lt. Governor Bill Bolling has also stated that none of the prospective Republican candidates will be able to compete with Spanberger.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears' $3.1 million. In the lieutenant governor's race, 12 contenders reported a combined $2.4 million, with Republican Pat Herrity leading at $540,000. Democrats Levar Stoney and Aaron Rouse are virtually tied at just under $400,000. Fundraising is a key indicator of campaign strength and viability, and the flow of early money offers a roadmap for where parties and donors see the biggest opportunities or threats. Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, noted that Stoney's strong showing is likely helped by a familiar fundraising machine - former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who endorsed Stoney's bid early on. 'McAuliffe's greatest skill as a politician has always been fundraising. And that pipeline will be very useful to the former mayor,' he said. The race for attorney general has also attracted big money early, with incumbent Jason Miyares raising $1.5 million and former Del. Jay Jones following with $931,000. Democrat Shannon Taylor pulled in $534,000.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 17, 2025 09:34 AM\nSource:[wtop.com](https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/big-bucks-big-stakes-virginia-candidates-raise-over-20-million-as-2025-election-season-heats-up/)\n\n**Former Virginia delegate launches 2025 gubernatorial bid**\nFormer Virginia delegate Dave LaRock has launched a bid for the 2025 Republican gubernatorial nomination, challenging Lt.

    "summary": "Forecasting experts broadly agree that Jerrauld (Jay) Jones is the clear favorite to win the 2025 Democratic primary for attorney general of Virginia. Their probabilities for Jones's victory cluster between 72% and 90%, with most in the 75-85% range. Consensus reasoning identifies Jones\u2019s major advantages as his substantial fundraising lead (about $1.8 million to Taylor's $1 million), higher name recognition from prior statewide campaigns and family legacy, stronger and broader Democratic establishment and party network ties (especially in Tidewater/Hampton Roads Black political circles), and a base within key primary electorates (notably Black and urban voters). Experts also note that the field is limited to Jones and Henrico County prosecutor Shannon Taylor, and that base rates in Virginia Democratic primaries overwhelmingly favor better-funded, well-known candidates unless disrupted by a late-breaking scandal or surprise turnout surge. While Taylor is a credible, regionally strong challenger (especially in Henrico/suburban Richmond with some appeal to suburban and moderate liberals), experts find no evidence of momentum, disruptive endorsements, or scandals favoring her. Several point out that upsets are possible in low-turnout off-cycle primaries, but absent a late shock\u2014such as a significant scandal, turnout anomaly, or sweeping endorsement movement for Taylor\u2014Jones\u2019s structural and coalition-building advantages are decisive. In summary, expert forecasters expect Jay Jones to win the Democratic primary, citing campaign fundamentals and historical precedent as key drivers of his high probability of success."
