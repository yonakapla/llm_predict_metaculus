Morrisey said, 'Taxpayer dollars should be targeted toward nutritious foods.' RFK, Jr. joked that he would be becoming Morrisey's personal trainer and would be submitting him to public weigh-ins. The move marks a turning point in the battle between nutritional advocates and beverage manufacturers and sellers over whether SNAP dollars should be used to buy soft drinks. The American Beverage Association, the industry's lobbying group, released a statement decrying the efforts to remove junk food from a program that is supposed to provide nutrition, saying 'Limiting choice by restricting SNAP purchases is a slippery slope that won't make Americans healthier.' However, RFK, Jr. argued that SNAP benefits are a government benefit and it has the right to decide what that benefit can be used for. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins indicated that USDA is on board with the ban, saying, 'I look forward to receiving Governor Morrisey's SNAP pilot request and will work swiftly to make certain West Virginia is equipped with the technical assistance and expertise to move forward.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 28, 2025 07:43 PM\nSource:[Redstate](https://redstate.com/streiff/2025/03/28/rfk-jr-allows-states-to-ban-soft-drink-purchases-with-food-stamps-setting-up-a-major-political-fight-n2187227)\n\n**Beverage Stocks Fall Amid Proposal to Ban Soda Sales with Food Stamps**\nThe stocks of major beverage companies Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Keurig Dr Pepper fell slightly after news broke out about a proposal to ban the sale of soda with food stamps. The proposal, part of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda, aims to prevent the use of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funds for the purchase of soda. Supporters of the policy argue that soda contributes to chronic diseases and illnesses in children. However, critics argue that the proposal is punitive towards low-income individuals, restricting their choices. The American Beverage Association has opposed the proposal, with Senior Vice President Merideth Potter stating, 'What's not helpful in this whole discussion is the claim that soda causes obesity. We've become a whipping boy.' Despite industry resistance, the movement has gained momentum, with West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey recently expressing his intention to seek federal support for implementing the ban. However, the US Department of Agriculture, not Kennedy's Health Department, is responsible for administering SNAP and granting exemptions for program changes.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 28, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/getrankeaktien-fallen-nach-vorschlag-zum-verbot-von-limonaden-93CH-2935321)\n\n**SODA JERKS? Nick Sortor Calls Out Influencers Being Paid by Companies to Oppose MAHA's SNAP Pop Ban**\nThe 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) movement, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is considering a ban on buying certain 'junk foods' with funds provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP) program. Kennedy has stated that the government should not be subsidizing people to eat 'poison' and has called for the government to stop allowing SNAP benefits to be used to pay for soda or processed foods. However, companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are reportedly paying influencers to lobby against the soda ban, with one influencer, Nick Sortor, stating, 'I refuse to take a dime from them.' Sortor also notes that people on food stamps are likely on Medicare/Medicaid, meaning taxpayers are also paying for their healthcare. He argues that if the government is footing the bill, they should decide what can and can't be spent on SNAP benefits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 23, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[Twitchy](https://twitchy.com/amy-curtis/2025/03/22/nick-sortor-soda-lobbyists-paying-influencers-to-oppose-snap-soda-ban-n2410266)\n\n**Study: Overwhelming Majority of EBT-Eligible Food Products Are Ultra-Processed**\nA recent study found that 62% of Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) eligible products are ultra-processed foods, with nearly half containing artificial flavorings and 8% containing additives banned in California or California schools. The study, conducted by advocacy group GoCoCo, analyzed over 13,000 SNAP-EBT eligible products at a major grocery retailer. The findings have sparked concerns that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) may be 'encouraging families to eat highly processed, unhealthy junk food' rather than nourishing them with wholesome options. According to the study, over 160 products contain Red Dye No. 3, which has been recently banned by the FDA. Critics argue that big food lobbyists in Washington and at the state level are influencing policymakers to include ultra-processed foods in the EBT program, often using accusations of racism to silence opponents. Proposed policy shifts by new HHS Secretary RFK Jr. could help resolve this issue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 08:34 AM\nSource:[PJ Media](https://pjmedia.com/benbartee/2025/02/28/study-overwhelming-majority-of-ebt-eligible-food-products-are-ultra-processed-n4937405)\n\n**Utah takes step to ban candy and soda purchases on food stamps**\nUtah Rep. Kristen Chevrier is sponsoring HB403, a bill that prohibits the use of SNAP benefits (food stamps) to purchase candy and soft drinks in Utah. The bill passed in committee 7-2 and aims to reduce the purchase of unhealthy food products that contribute to obesity, anxiety, depression, and chronic illness. Health advocate Calley Means, who joined Chevrier in introducing the bill, stated, 'There is zero nutritional value in soft drinks or most candy.' Means also criticized the influence of soda companies, saying, 'Pepsi and Coca-Cola have lobbied tens of millions of dollars to make sure their products are on food stamps.' The bill defines candy and soft drinks, excluding protein bars with no added sugar, and may change before moving to the House for a vote. Chevrier hopes that Utah's lead will inspire national action and put pressure on Congress to reform the SNAP program.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 04:17 AM\nSource:[KSL.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51259131/utah-takes-step-to-ban-candy-and-soda-purchases-on-food-stamps)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts overwhelmingly agree that Amazon will still list a 12-pack of Coca-Cola as 'SNAP EBT eligible' on July 1, 2025. Their analyses highlight several consistent points:\n\n- The current policy status quo allows soda purchases with SNAP, and the referenced Amazon listing still includes the 'SNAP EBT eligible' label as of the latest check.\n\n- All new state-level waivers to restrict soda from SNAP (e.g., Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana) will not take effect until January 1, 2026, or later. No states are scheduled to implement these changes before July 1, 2025.\n\n- There is no evidence or news of any nationwide (federal) restriction or rule change removing soda from SNAP by July 2025. Any such federal change would require significant lead time, public notification, and typically faces heavy industry lobbying and logistical complexity.\n\n- Amazon, as a national retailer, adjusts SNAP EBT eligibility based on effective regulatory deadlines, usually implementing regional restrictions based on shipping address after rules take effect. Historically, Amazon does not preemptively remove eligibility at the national listing level unless absolutely compelled by law or a majority of states are affected.\n\n- The experts note the technical barriers, policy inertia, and historical lag between regulatory decision and platform implementation. Industry lobbying and political friction also reinforce that rapid, mid-year changes are unlikely.\n\n- The only scenarios the forecasters see leading to a 'No' outcome would involve either Amazon taking a highly unusual, preemptive national action without regulatory mandate, or an emergency, immediately enforced federal rule\u2014which none see supported by current news or typical regulatory procedures.\n\n- Probabilities assigned by experts are all high (ranging from 94% to 98%), reflecting strong agreement on both the base rate of SNAP eligibility change timing and Amazon's historical compliance behavior.\n\nIn sum, barring an unprecedented last-minute regulatory surprise or technical error, the consensus is near-certain that Amazon's 12-pack Coca-Cola listing will retain the 'SNAP EBT eligible' label on July 1, 2025."
