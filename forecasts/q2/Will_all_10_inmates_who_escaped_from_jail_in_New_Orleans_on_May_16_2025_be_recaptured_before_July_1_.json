Here, law enforcement pressure is extremely intense, and community engagement is maximized by unusually large rewards and media coverage, which compresses the typical timeline for recapture. However, two critical mitigating factors remain: Massey's proven ability to evade, and the evidence of a sophisticated external assistance network, which persists despite a dozen arrests. These factors notably decrease recapture odds, especially as time since the escape increases, and as escapees exploit investigative gaps (potentially leaving Louisiana altogether). Still, law enforcement's sustained focus and inter-agency collaboration are powerful counterforces. Applying my experience, I judge the base rate uplift and resource surge outweigh, though do not eliminate, the threat from these two escapees' skills/networks. I therefore estimate there is a strong but not overwhelming chance of total recapture (including death), putting odds just above a coin flip. The scenario is too adverse for extreme confidence, but unlikely enough to predict majority 'No'.",

However, even skilled escapees face declining odds as networks erode and fatigue, fear, and operational mistakes accumulate. The resource surge, record tip inflow, and high rewards all increase recapture chances, but Massey's past ability to evade for extended periods and the possibility that at least one fugitive has left the metro area or has high-level aid decreases the odds from certainty. Base rates for serial escapees suggest some stick it out for months; but with this high-profile, both are likely already on the feds\u2019 radar and their risk tolerance (and ability to avoid mistakes under pressure) is limited.

Plus, your bell curve model assumes the current intensity of public and police pressure will remain constant\u2014a heroic (and ahistorical) assumption given both city and state are burning through overtime and redirecting personnel at unsustainable rates. The notion that publicity always overpowers local inertia grossly overestimates social motivation to cooperate when local anti-police sentiment may INCREASE as the hunt drags on. You're squashing structural variables into a neat parabola, but the messy, adaptive reality of two hardened, experienced escapees in a city with deep criminal subcultures makes any forecast above 60% questionable at best."

You treat the pressure dynamic as inevitably catalyzing evasion, but on the ground, it just as often leads to exposure.

The closure of urban and regional activity spaces, plus the rapid attrition of hiding places in a media-saturated, tip-rich environment, tilts the odds further toward definitive recapture before July 1."

Weighing these, I recognize the effect of the support network attrition and the law enforcement response IS higher than average for typical escapes, but the most difficult period is just beginning.

My own field knowledge supports that after the first 10-14 days, the recapture rate for outlier fugitives in high-profile escapes (especially serial escapees like Massey) drops significantly, despite resource surges and publicity. However, no forecaster credibly makes the case for a probability far below 50%, and the overall tone of tips, network attrition, and law enforcement political commitment still justifies a moderate tilt toward 'Yes'.

UsRegionalCriminalJusticeNewOrleansPolicingPractices' argument about Louisiana's historic track record and persistent escapee support networks is especially sobering. Moreover, after the two-week mark, the odds of recapturing professional escapees drop substantially, as base rates shift and the value of individual skill sets is maximized. While I maintain that the public and political pressure keeps the odds above a coin flip, a recalibration is warranted to more sharply respect the escapees' proven adaptability, the exhaustion of easy tips, and the regional challenges.

There was notable support (from CorrectionsInmateClassificationSystems and myself) for factoring New Orleans' institutional risk and the historic base rates of at least one fugitive eluding recapture even with a dragnet. Nobody provided novel evidence that would justify greater optimism; in fact, the debate helped consolidate the view that the attrition of weak accomplices doesn't equate to closing the net on skilled runners. The critique of overly-theoretical, high odds was persuasive, reinforcing my original skepticism. I see little justification to move substantially: the odds that at least one remains free (or unaccounted for) by July 1 persist. However, I modestly recognize that the financial and political costs, as other forecasters stressed, may just barely increase the intensity and duration of the search, nudging odds very slightly higher.

My first forecast slightly overrated the effect of resource surge and public incentivization, underplaying the adaptation and resilience of these particular escapees and region-specific criminal context. While extraordinary guardianship is still potent, I now judge the likelihood of total recapture (or 'Yes' resolution) by July 1 should be lower, but still above even odds due to mounting constraints on support and resources for the escapees.

CorrectionsInmateClassificationSystems and CriminologyRoutineActivitiesTheory both overstate the power of resource surges and base rates, while UsRegionalCriminalJusticeNewOrleansPolicingPractices and my own initial critique provide needed skepticism rooted in region-specific realities. The constructive point from the group is that the marginal difficulty of recapturing the last, most capable escapees is even higher in New Orleans than I initially allowed for. Community disorganization, potential for active interference, and the degradation of manhunt intensity (especially after weeks of resource burn) mean that if the escapees have not been caught already, they are distinctly above-average in evasion ability.

Given Massey's history of evasion and the structural vulnerabilities of New Orleans' law enforcement apparatus, the recapture rate curve flattens much more rapidly once the first dragnet is over. While base rates and the collapse of support networks remain real strengths for law enforcement, the adversarial skills and adaptive support structures in play suggest my initial 70% was a touch too optimistic.

The critique of over-reliance on general base rates and resource surges is salient, as is the warning that environmental closure does not act as predictably as textbook Crime Pattern Theory suggests, particularly in the unique context of New Orleans. However, counterarguments supporting a robust recapture surge\u2014arrest of numerous accomplices, exceptional monetary rewards, and public/media saturation\u2014remain valid, especially with a full month left. I thus adjust downward to reflect genuine uncertainty introduced by expert argumentation, especially the notable risk that at least one fugitive, likely Massey, leverages chaos or goes out-of-state. The prediction remains above 65% due to structural advantages for law enforcement but is moderated in light of escapee skill and local context. My revised probability is 72%.",

According to The Associated Press, two of the fugitives, Leo Tate (31) and Jermaine Donald (42), were captured on Monday after a high-speed police chase in Walker County, Texas. 'They simply surrendered,' said Lieutenant Wade Roberts of the Huntsville Police Department. Another fugitive, Lenton Vanburen Jr. (26), was found sitting on a bench in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after a tip from an anonymous caller. Five people, including three family members, have been arrested for allegedly helping Vanburen, and face charges of 'accessory after the fact,' which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison. Two fugitives, Derrick Groves (27) and Antoine Massey (33), are still at large and considered highly dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer and faces additional charges for assaulting a corrections officer, while Massey has a lengthy criminal history and is being sought by authorities in St. Tammany Parish for kidnapping and rape. A $20,000 reward has been offered for information leading to their capture. The escape, which occurred nearly two weeks ago, exposed critical security flaws in the prison system. The inmates were able to force open a faulty door, escape through a hole behind a toilet, scale a fence with barbed wire, and flee under the cover of darkness. An independent investigation by the federal monitor of the 2013 consent decree on the New Orleans prison system warns of a deteriorated security situation in the facility. The report states that inmates were smoking marijuana without consequence, manufacturing homemade weapons, and in many cases, manipulating their cell locks.

Law enforcement officials will hold a news conference on Thursday to update the public and encourage tips through the Crime Stoppers reward program. Crime Stoppers President Darlene Cusanza said they have received over 650 tips, with 500 more than their previous record, and have recaptured eight of the ten escapees so far. The reward for information leading to the arrest of Massey or Groves stands at $20,000 per inmate. The manhunt has already cost the City of New Orleans approximately $250,000 per week in overtime, with Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick stating that violent crime investigations had to be paused to prioritize the inmate search.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[https://www.ksla.com](https://www.ksla.com/2025/05/29/escapees-still-large-officials-address-public-thursday-jailbreak-manhunt/)\n\n**New Orleans Prison Escape: Eight Recaptured, Two Remain at Large**\nEight of the ten inmates who escaped from a prison in New Orleans have been recaptured, but two remain at large. According to The Associated Press, two of the fugitives, Leo Tate (31) and Jermaine Donald (42), were captured on Monday after a high-speed police chase in Walker County, Texas. 'They simply surrendered,' said Lieutenant Wade Roberts of the Huntsville Police Department. Another fugitive, Lenton Vanburen Jr. (26), was found sitting on a bench in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after a tip from an anonymous caller. Five people, including three family members, have been arrested for allegedly helping Vanburen, and face charges of 'accessory after the fact,' which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison. Two fugitives, Derrick Groves (27) and Antoine Massey (33), are still at large and considered highly dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer and faces additional charges for assaulting a corrections officer, while Massey has a lengthy criminal history and is being sought by authorities in St. Tammany Parish for kidnapping and rape. A $20,000 reward has been offered for information leading to their capture. The escape, which occurred nearly two weeks ago, exposed critical security flaws in the prison system. The inmates were able to force open a faulty door, escape through a hole behind a toilet, scale a fence with barbed wire, and flee under the cover of darkness. An independent investigation by the federal monitor of the 2013 consent decree on the New Orleans prison system warns of a deteriorated security situation in the facility. The report states that inmates were smoking marijuana without consequence, manufacturing homemade weapons, and in many cases, manipulating their cell locks. The monitors recommend reinstating a maximum-security unit, which was eliminated in 2022 by the current sheriff, Susan Hutson, who has been criticized for her decisions in the past two years.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 02:35 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/estados-unidos/2025/05/29/video-muestra-el-momento-en-que-oficiales-de-texas-capturaron-a-dos-reos-fugitivos-de-nueva-orleans/)\n\n**Louisiana AG confident remaining jailbreak fugitives will be recaptured after officials make 14th arrest**\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is confident that the two remaining escaped inmates, Antoine T.

    "summary": "Across the expert forecasts, there is consensus that the probability of all 10 New Orleans jailbreak escapees being recaptured (or killed) by July 1, 2025 is high, but not a certainty. All experts note that 8 of the 10 fugitives have been quickly recaptured, with only two\u2014Antoine Massey (a serial escapee) and Derrick Groves (convicted murderer)\u2014still at large as of May 30, 2025. Key positive factors driving recapture odds include an exceptionally intensive manhunt with large cash rewards ($50,000 per fugitive), federal and local law enforcement coordination, hundreds of public tips, arrests of over a dozen accomplices/supporters, and massive publicity creating strong community involvement. Experts using policing, manhunt operations, and criminological frameworks generally assess a probability in the 62\u201388% range, emphasizing the importance of resource deployment, rapid attrition of support networks, and historical US base rates (most jailbreakers are recaptured within weeks, especially with high rewards and media attention). \n\nHowever, all experts caution that the two remaining fugitives are particularly difficult to catch: Massey is a known serial escapee with prior success evading law enforcement for weeks or months, and both may have benefited from established assistance networks, possibly out of state. Forecasters with backgrounds in corrections, sociology, and regional justice note that probability of total recapture sharply declines after the first 10\u201314 days, especially for skilled escapees. Regional institutional weaknesses (historic jail dysfunction in New Orleans) and remaining criminal networks also pose negative factors. The lowest forecast (42%) comes from an expert emphasizing the base rate falloff for total recapture in the final month and New Orleans' history of jailbreak fallout. \n\nThe collective probability for complete recapture varies from 42% to 88%, with most forecasts clustering between 62% and 76%. The principal division is between those giving strong weight to the scale of law enforcement response and public engagement (who forecast >65%), versus those emphasizing serial escapee base rates and organizational vulnerabilities (forecasting <50%). All agree that recapture remains more likely than not, but with significant risk that one experienced fugitive could evade beyond July 1, 2025."
