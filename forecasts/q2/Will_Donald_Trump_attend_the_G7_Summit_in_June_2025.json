The tailed risks you allude to are covered by the usual unpredictable crises, not Trump waking up and deciding to throw out the entire G7 choreography at the last minute just for drama.

Sheinbaum could also use the opportunity to reestablish Mexico's relationship with Canada and meet with European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission. However, attending the summit could also be seen as supporting Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has a tense relationship with Trump, and could lead to friction with the US. According to the article, Sheinbaum's decision will ultimately depend on whether Trump indicates a willingness to meet with her in Canada. If he does, she will attend, but if not, she will likely decline the invitation to avoid straining her relationship with the US.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 02:28 AM\nSource:[heraldodemexico.com.mx](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/opinion/2025/6/2/debe-claudia-sheinbaum-ir-al-g-7-703838.html)\n\n**G7 Summit 2025: Check Dates, Host Country, Participants and Representatives from Core Members**\nThe 51st G7 Summit will take place from June 15 to June 17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada.

This would be a departure from the usual practice of inviting India as a guest to the summit. The G7 summit, which will take place from June 15 to 17, is expected to be attended by leaders of the member countries, including US President Donald Trump. The summit will focus on global challenges such as international security, the global economy, climate change, and digital transformations.

Sheinbaum said that attending the summit was a possibility, but some argue that she should not go because US President Trump may 'embosk' her, as he did to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The real concern is that Trump may make public statements about certain Mexican politicians. The G-7 summit will be held from June 15 to 17 in Kananakis, Alberta, and will include leaders from France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Italy, and the European Union. Carney wants to negotiate the elimination of tariffs before the renegotiation of the USMCA trade agreement. Sheinbaum's reluctance to accept the invitation is questionable, given that all countries attending the summit, except for Brazil, Ukraine, and the UK, have a trade agreement with Mexico and are major investors. Sheinbaum will face criticism for the judicial reform and other legislative changes implemented by her government that affect trade agreements and investment in Mexico. To eliminate tariffs and the remittance tax, Sheinbaum must speak with Trump, as he is the only one who decides on US commercial policy. If Sheinbaum decides not to attend the summit, it may put the future of the USMCA as a trilateral agreement at risk, negatively affecting growth expectations and the exchange rate.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 11:53 AM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/opinion/jorge-molina-larrondo/2025/06/02/sheinbaum-el-g-7-y-el-tmec/)\n\n**Claudia Sheinbaum's Dilemma: To Attend the G-7 Summit or Not**\nThe decision for Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to attend the G-7 summit in Canada is a difficult one.

The participation of Modi in the summit remains uncertain due to strained relations between New Delhi and Ottawa. India is not a member of the 'Big Seven', but usually receives an invitation as a guest. India Today notes that Modi has attended every G7 summit over the past five years, but this time the country has not yet received an official invitation to the meeting, which will take place from June 15 to 17, and the Indian side's resolve to attend the summit is in doubt. Moreover, the channel reports that there are still unresolved security issues that need to be addressed before Modi's possible participation is confirmed. In May 2025, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated that there was no information about the Prime Minister's visit to the summit in Canada. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand noted that the newly elected government of Mark Carney is trying to strengthen partnership relations with India, but acknowledges that the murder of separatist leader Hardip Singh Nijjar has complicated bilateral relations. Tensions between the countries have increased after the Canadian government accused India of involvement in the incident, which India categorically denied. As a result of the diplomatic crisis, ambassadors from both countries were recalled, and diplomatic relations were severed at the ambassadorial level. 'We are trying to strengthen our partnership with India, but we recognize that the murder of Hardip Singh Nijjar has complicated our bilateral relations,' Anand said. 'We are working to resolve this issue and restore our relations to their previous level.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/modi-mozhet-propustit-sammit-g7-v-kanade-iz-za-problem-v-otnosheniyah-s-ottavoj-635520.html)\n\n**Sheinbaum's Dilemma: To Attend the G-7 Summit or Not**\nMexican President Sheinbaum has been invited to the G-7 summit by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, but her response has been cautious.

This is the first time in six years that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not be attending the summit. The main reason for this decision is the growing diplomatic tension between India and Canada, particularly over the issue of Khalistan separatist activities. Canada has been under pressure from Khalistani groups to not invite India to the summit. Additionally, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian agencies of being involved in the murder of Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in 2023, which India rejected as 'baseless and motivated'. The diplomatic tension between the two countries has been escalating since then, with both countries expelling each other's diplomats and suspending trade talks. However, there have been recent efforts to improve relations, including a meeting between the two countries' diplomats in March 2025. Despite this, India's absence from the G7 summit may have an impact on its global influence and participation in international forums. The G7 is an international platform where the world's seven most developed and democratic economies come together to discuss global economic, political, security, climate, and technological issues.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[News18 India](https://hindi.news18.com/news/knowledge/explainer-india-not-invited-to-2025-g7-summit-canada-takes-tough-stance-reasons-ws-el-9281660.html)\n\n**Claudia Sheinbaum's Dilemma: To Attend the G-7 Summit or Not**\nThe decision for Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to attend the G-7 summit in Canada is a difficult one.

According to Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, Trump will be in Canada from June 15 to 17. More details about his visit will be announced soon, Leavitt said. The 51st G7 summit will take place in Kananaskis, Alberta, from June 15 to 17, and will feature the presence of the group's main members. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will also attend. The G7 has shown unity in its financial summit, with finance ministers from the group's member countries, as well as the heads of the World Bank, IMF, OECD, and Financial Stability Board, participating in a three-day meeting in Banff, Alberta. They discussed global trade, artificial intelligence, and the war in Ukraine. 'After 50 years of joint work, overcoming national differences and promoting global prosperity, the value of the G7 is evident,' the statement reads. 'We maintained a fruitful and frank exchange of views on the current global economic and financial situation, common risks and opportunities, and ways to address them.' US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell represented the US delegation at the meeting. Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne concluded the three-day meeting, saying that there was a sense of unity among G7 members. 'The best proof of unity is that we have a joint statement,' Champagne said. The statement does not mention Trump's tariffs, but addresses the multiple and complex global challenges and 'we are committed to pursuing our shared policy objectives.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[magazinelatino.com](https://www.magazinelatino.com/casa-blanca-confirma-que-donald-trump-visitara-canada-para-cumbre-del-g7/)\n\n**Trudeau Confirms Trump's Attendance at G7 Summit, Describes Meeting as 'Beginning of Reshaping Our Relationship'**\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that US President Donald Trump (also known as Trump or\u5ddd\u666e) will attend the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, in June 2025.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts assessed that the probability of Donald Trump attending the G7 Summit in June 2025 is extremely high, with final probabilities ranging from 97% to 99%. Their reasoning converges on several key points: multiple and recent official confirmations by the White House and the Canadian government substantiate Trump's planned in-person attendance; the historical base rate for U.S. presidents missing G7 summits after formal confirmation is extremely low (well under 5%, and often cited as <2%); and the traditional expectation, logistical preparation, and diplomatic practices all support attendance barring extraordinary events. Factors increasing attendance probability include strong personal and political incentives for Trump, established summit protocols, ongoing international coordination, and detailed security/logistical preparations. The only points of caution across forecasts were rare but conceivable last-minute disruptions such as acute health emergencies, security threats, or sudden large-scale crises, which minimally decrease probability but do not substantially alter the base outcome. Across all expert perspectives\u2014ranging from executive protocols, summit traditions, rational choice theory, to international relations and leadership studies\u2014the consensus is that barring unforeseeable disruptive events, Trump will attend the G7 in person as scheduled."
