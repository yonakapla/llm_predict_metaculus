However, with the leaderboard gap narrowed to <1%, and known Arena volatility (including tie rules), the possibility of a Gemini tie for #1 slightly raises the probability. Leaderboard manipulation exposes both OpenAI and Google to private tuning opportunities but does not give either a unique edge. Considering technical trends, leaderboard dynamics, recent model announcements, and press sentiment, the best estimate for a Google-owned model (Gemini or Gemma) being #1 overall at resolution is moderately below even odds, but higher than a flat base rate would suggest: a scenario roughly 1 in 3.

You lean too heavily on the volatility and manipulation narrative\u2014sure, those are real, but you gloss over the persistent weight of OpenAI's platform advantage, user loyalty, and cultural standing outside the tech niche. Your scenario for a late Gemini push ignores how hard it is to manufacture organic Arena upvotes overnight, especially when the majority of engaged testers already reside in OpenAI's ecosystem and have inertia on their side. Let's not pretend that historical underperformance at the actual quarterly snapshot is just randomness\u2014it's social lock-in, and it's strong. Simply put: you're mistaking leaderboard noise for real, sustainable conversion. Pull those odds back, or you're swimming in recency bias."

The arguments defending high odds for a Gemini #1 rely too much on technical milestones and leaderboard manipulation, while downplaying the sticky nature of user perception, engagement, and last-moment OpenAI push. Additionally, consensus in the group sits well below 50%, with most forecasters, from both algorithmic and socio-technical perspectives, emphasizing how difficult it is for Google to sustain #1 at precise quarter-end timings.

Furthermore, my own defense of the more cautious 45% estimate revealed that even with the Elo gap this tight, historical base rates and the aggressive last-moment OpenAI updates suggest the outcome is less about equal technical merit and more about entrenched user preference and timing.

Both critiques of the bullish (63%) stance and defenses of more cautious forecasts make clear that while Google has closed the technical gap and can potentially engineer a brief surge, the base rates, social inertia of the OpenAI user community, and the history of recurring OpenAI comebacks are too powerful to ignore. Additionally, the arguments highlight that leaderboard manipulation and technical excellence do not guarantee enduring Arena popularity, especially at a critical quarterly snapshot. The slight risks of a tie or volatile late-stage surge are acknowledged but don't outweigh fundamentals. The consensus leans toward ~30-40%, but given the additional scrutiny, I remain at the low end, only slightly tempted to edge up.

However, the defense from ChinatechnologyanalysisEastasiaaiindustrytrends and my own review of leaderboard manipulation and tie vs. volatility scenarios affirm that Google\u2019s odds are still substantially elevated versus historical base rates. The primary adjustment is a stronger discount for status quo inertia and the likelihood that even modest leaderboard shifts will favor OpenAI barring an extraordinary, well-timed Google push. Thus, while the chance for a Gemini #1 (including via a tie) remains non-trivial due to volatility and Google's private testing toolbox, the majority probability is too aggressive.

The lone bullish (>60%) view over-indexes on manipulation potential and underplays base rate inertia both historically and as baked into Chatbot Arena's social-dynamic context. Critique and defense rounds strongly reinforce the fact that, while Google's late-cycle push makes a surge plausible (and ties are crucial to bump up the odds), OpenAI's proven ability to rally and its entrenched voter base still provide a persistent edge at quarterly deadlines. My original 45% was on the upper end of justifiable, but evidence from the panel warrants a modest downward revision, especially as none of the data or argument suggests Gemini now firmly leads, only that the race is close.

While a few forecasters lean aggressively bullish on Gemini due to technical parity and manipulation risks, the critical engagement\u2014especially with ArtificialIntelligenceBenchmarkevaluationmethods\u2014exposes the thin evidence for a truly sustained #1 at the Q2 snapshot. Strong defenses from ComputerScienceAlgorithmicperformanceanalysis and ArtificialIntelligenceTransformerarchitectures echo my own logic: technical surges rarely translate into immediate, decisive Arena victory, and OpenAI\u2019s base rate of closing out quarters as #1 is augmented by habitual user preference loops. No new information fundamentally upends the initial calibration; if anything, the risk of adopting a more bullish stance appears driven by recency bias and over-interpretation of leaderboard volatility, rather than robust evidence for a Google tipping point.

Scale AI is a contractor for Google, OpenAI, and other major AI developers, helping partners train AI models by providing data labeling services. A significant portion of this work is done by low-cost labor outside the US, but it is a crucial component of AI development. As part of the deal, Alexandr Wang, the CEO of Scale AI, will join Meta directly under Mark Zuckerberg and lead a new AI lab tasked with developing 'superintelligence.' Wang will also retain his seat on Scale AI's board. 'In the coming weeks, we will share more about these efforts and the talented individuals who have joined our team,' Meta said. Mark Zuckerberg has been actively recruiting scientists for the new department, contacting potential candidates directly and offering them multi-million dollar salaries, including those from Google. The move comes after Meta's Llama 4 AI model disappointed the public, and the company is now lagging behind Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek. The release of Llama 4 has been delayed several times, and Meta has been accused of manipulating a public leaderboard to make its AI seem better than it is. The company has yet to release Llama 4 Behemoth, the largest and most expensive version announced in April. Meta's two priorities for 2025 are to make its chatbot Meta AI a 'leading personal AI' and to 'create full general intelligence.' The company's user base for Meta AI has reached 1 billion monthly users, according to Mark Zuckerberg, but this number is heavily influenced by the user bases of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, which all integrate the chatbot.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 13, 2025 08:52 AM\nSource:[3DNews - Daily Digital Digest](https://3dnews.ru/1124375/meta-kupila-polovinu-scale-ai-za-14-mlrd-v-popitke-dognat-konkurentov-v-gonke-ii)\n\n**2 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term**\nTwo growth stocks to buy now and hold for the long term are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).

The researchers found that major companies such as Google, OpenAI, and Meta have an unfair advantage in the system, and that the rankings can be manipulated by private testing. According to the study, these companies can test multiple private models before releasing them to the public, and then only release the best-performing model to the public. This can lead to a biased ranking system, where average-performing models are ranked higher than they should be. The researchers also found that proprietary models, which do not disclose their neural network parameters, have an advantage over open-weight models and open-source models in terms of the number of prompts they receive. This can lead to a situation where AI developers can adjust their models using previous data and achieve high scores in the next month. The authors of the study recommend that all LLMs, including private ones, should be scored and published to increase transparency and fairness. However, the operators of Chatbot Arena have responded to the study, claiming that it contains factual errors and misinterpretations.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: June 10, 2025 10:20 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u7d4c\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\uff08xTECH\uff09](https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/mag/nc/18/040900481/060300005/)\n\n**Starling launches AI chatbot Spending Intelligence in UK banking first**\nStarling Bank has become the first UK bank to integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) AI chatbot, called Spending Intelligence, into its banking app. The chatbot, powered by Google's Gemini, allows customers to ask questions about their spending habits, such as 'how much did I spend on groceries last week?' or 'how much did I donate to charity last year?' Harriet Rees, Starling's CIO, said, 'This is the first step for us of putting AI in the hands of customers.' The chatbot is free to use and provides insights into customers' spending, but does not offer regulated advice. The hope is that it will help customers to see exactly where their money goes and make informed decisions about their budgeting. Rees added, 'But there's so much further we could go' and mentioned potential future uses of AI, such as fraud detection and new customer onboarding.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 10, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/saving/article-14794627/Starling-launches-AI-chatbot-Spending-Intelligence-UK-banking-first.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)\n\n**What's the best image generator? Check this leaderboard (and vote for your favorite)**\nLMArena.ai is a new website that allows users to track and vote on the best image-generating AI models. The website, which was launched in beta last month, ranks models based on their ability to generate images based on text descriptions. The Elo system, originally devised for chess, is used to rank the models, and users' votes impact the rankings. Currently, OpenAI's GPT Image 1 holds the top spot, followed by Google's Imagen and Luma's Photon. The website aims to provide clarity in the crowded market of generative AI tools, which has been sparked by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. As a result, users are faced with a massive number of choices, and websites like LMArena have stepped in to provide some clarity. AI developers also benefit from these websites, as they provide platforms for sharing valuable feedback and are based on extensive testing, leading to a steady stream of use that helps the models improve. 'The website was originally founded as a research initiative through UC Berkeley with the name Chatbot Arena, and has since become a full-fledged platform, with financial support from UC Berkeley, a16z, Sequoia Capital, and elsewhere,' according to its homepage. 'Every user's vote impacts models' rankings on the scoreboard through the Elo system, which was originally devised to rank players in chess and other competitive games.

The researchers analyzed over 2 million rounds of data and found that some top companies, such as Google, OpenAI, and Meta, have an unfair advantage due to their ability to conduct private tests that are not reflected in the public rankings. The study's authors argue that these companies can select the best-performing model from their private tests and submit it to Chatbot Arena, which can lead to biased rankings. They also suggest that the frequent changes in the top-ranked models on Chatbot Arena may be due to the fact that major AI development companies are testing multiple private models simultaneously. Additionally, the study found that proprietary models with unpublished parameters have more opportunities to compete and accumulate more prompt data, giving them an unfair advantage. The authors recommend that all LLMs, including private ones, should be scored and published to increase transparency and fairness. Andrej Karpathy, co-founder of OpenAI, also commented on the study, stating that the rankings on Chatbot Arena have become increasingly disconnected from reality. Chatbot Arena's operator, LM Arena, responded to the study with a rebuttal, claiming that the study contains factual errors and misinterpretations.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: May 15, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u7d4c\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\uff08xTECH\uff09](https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/02801/051400019/)\n\n**Google Releases Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview with Improved Coding Abilities**\nGoogle has released the Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, an upgraded version of its flagship product Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model.

The study analyzed over 2.8 million model battles over five months and found that Meta, OpenAI, and Google's models had a much higher exposure rate than other companies, with more opportunities to collect user feedback and optimize their models. The researchers also discovered that closed commercial models like Google and OpenAI had a significantly higher number of battles on the platform compared to open-source models, which were more likely to be removed. According to the statistics, 61.3% of all data on the platform flowed to a specific set of model providers, with OpenAI and Google taking 20.4% and 19.2% of the total battle data, respectively. In contrast, 83 open-source models accounted for only 29.7%. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy questioned the fairness of the evaluation on X, suggesting that Google's Gemini model had a significant lead in the rankings but performed poorly in actual use. He suspected that Google and other tech giants were manipulating the results. The study also found that LM Arena allowed large companies to privately test multiple model versions, but only published the results of the best-performing model, hiding the results of the weaker versions. Cohere's vice president Sara Hooker said, 'Only a few companies were told they could privately test, and the testing frequency was much higher than other companies, which is basically manipulating the rules.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 01, 2025 01:12 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/5957613)\n\n**Study accuses LM Arena of helping top AI labs game its benchmark**\nA new study from AI labs Cohere, Stanford, MIT, and Ai2 accuses LM Arena of helping top AI companies, including Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon, achieve better leaderboard scores on the popular crowdsourced AI benchmark Chatbot Arena.

    "summary": "Across seven forecasting experts with diverse backgrounds (machine learning engineering, AI product management, China technology analysis, benchmarking, algorithmic performance, transformer architectures, and innovation diffusion theory), there is consensus that Google's Gemini model is a strong contender for the #1 overall position on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of Q2 2025, but remains an underdog compared to OpenAI's GPT-4o/4.5. All experts agree that the leaderboard is extremely volatile, with technical performance gaps between top models (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, others) now narrowed to less than 1%, making a late swing, tie, or upset plausible. Factors that increase the probability of Gemini reaching #1 include: rapid recent technical upgrades by Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, Gemma 3), Google's ability to leverage private testing and optimize for leaderboards, aggressive release timing (often coinciding with quarter-ends), and the competitive nature of the sector where ties (counting as Yes) are possible. Factors that decrease Gemini\u2019s chances are: OpenAI\u2019s fast and frequent update cadence, entrenched community and user preference for OpenAI models, negative perception/PR issues facing Google (hallucination scandals, awkward releases, trust issues), and base rate history where Google rarely sustains #1 at critical resolution dates. Allegations of leaderboard manipulation affect both Google and OpenAI, and mostly serve to raise the probability of volatility rather than directly favoring Google. Probability estimates range from 22% to 63%, with most forecasts tightly clustered in the 30\u201345% range (median ~36\u201338%), and one notably higher estimate (63%) emphasizing tie/volatility potential and Google's strong incentives. In summary: while a Gemini #1 is technically plausible (especially with ties counting), the most likely scenario is that OpenAI retains the top position, with Gemini a close runner-up; a last-minute Google push or leaderboard volatility could deliver a surprise upset, but base rates and user voting inertia still favor OpenAI."
