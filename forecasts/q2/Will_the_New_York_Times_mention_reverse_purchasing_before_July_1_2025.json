However, despite its newsworthiness (intersection of tariffs, consumer economics, US-China relations), NYT has a historically high editorial threshold for importing non-canonical terms unless they achieve semi-viral status or are otherwise inescapable in describing current events (e.g., 'shrinkflation'). Furthermore, the short window and recent similar trends (e.g., 'daigou') rarely break out as keyworded English headlines in the West without a compelling US political, celebrity, or dramatic viral moment. Nonetheless, because US tariffs and the creative responses of Americans are salient\u2014and the NYT does occasionally publish explanatory features on precisely these sorts of behaviors\u2014there is a non-negligible chance of at least a passing mention, especially if the NYT aims to illustrate the direct human impact of economic policy.

Though there is an evident news peg (US tourists, tariffs, shopping in China), there is scant evidence that 'reverse purchasing' is being covered across the US mainstream media or is being used organically among US consumers. Barring a viral meme or a viral social media trend picked up wholesale, the probability remains low.

The NYT tends to avoid coining or borrowing novel phrases from foreign coverage until such terms are widely attested, explained by other major Anglophone sources, or become essential for clear communication with readers. Given 1) the cresting of the immediate news wave, 2) the lack of current mainstream US media usage in English, 3) the NYT's editorial conservatism and tendency to use more familiar terms, and 4) the absence of an obvious trigger event within the remaining three-week window, I judge the base-rate probability as low\u2014perhaps 3\u20135% for near-term foreign retail or trade neologisms making NYT within a month once already prominent in non-English media.

However, recent reporting out of China demonstrates real news momentum behind the 'reverse purchasing' trend, with English-language summaries and data from Alipay suggesting increased US interest. The phenomenon itself is clearly cross-border and new, and would be of interest to NYT business and international desks, especially if platforms like TikTok, Instagram, or Reddit spark US-side attention, or if the US government further references the issue in the context of tariffs. Nonetheless, given the absence of NYT uptake so far and the tendency toward alternative translations, the probability remains modest. On Lexical Diffusion Theory grounds, unless a novel, attention-grabbing event pushes the exact phrase into Anglophone prominence, diffusion into NYT's lexicon by July 1 is more unlikely than likely. Therefore, factoring in news momentum, linguistic inertia, and the short time frame, I estimate the chance at 23%.",

The NYT, noting that 'reverse purchasing' is a trending term in Chinese media/social media, either coins it in translation, sources it in a quote, or devotes a column/news brief to the phenomenon (possibly in a business, feature, or global news section) between June 9 and July 1, 2025.",
            "final_reasoning": "Given my sociological expertise and the Innovation Adoption Curve, I observe that while 'reverse purchasing' has significant traction in Chinese media and there are real consumer shifts in response to US-China tariffs (making this a newsworthy phenomenon), the jump from regional/niche coverage to prominent NYT mention typically requires a dual trigger: viral Anglophone social amplification or a clear, direct US economic/policy impact. The term itself is slightly awkward in English, and NYT exhibits caution in importing non-native neologisms unless they are trending heavily or present unique analytical value. With about 25 days left, there's enough time for a triggering event (new tariffs, viral coverage), but barring a clear US consumer or policy angle or widespread use by peers in the English-language press, the baseline for such a term making it into the NYT in such a short window is low (base rate: <15% for such coined foreign commerce neologisms appearing in NYT for the first time in a given month). However, with a slight uptick due to strong Chinese coverage and US-China friction salience, I estimate a small but real chance\u2014especially if a major English outlet or social media pushes the phrase or the NYT does a trend piece. Thus, I forecast a probability of 13%, with the main risks being a last-minute news item or a viral cultural moment.",

The most compelling arguments reminded me that even when international phenomena rise to salience, NYT adoption of a direct translation is typically slow, and substitution with native terminology or descriptive paraphrase is the norm.

Earlier, soybean oil had performed relatively well in the oil market due to low inventory and low import expectations. However, news that Canadian Prime Minister is negotiating tariffs to improve trade relations between the two countries has significantly alleviated concerns about supply shortages, causing soybean oil to reverse its trade surplus. From a fundamental perspective, the planting area of soybeans in major producing provinces such as Jiangsu, Hubei, and Anhui has increased compared to last year, and a large batch of domestic soybeans will be put on the market after the Dragon Boat Festival, which will increase soybean oil supply to some extent. In terms of imports, ship monitoring shows that China's soybean import purchases are still active, with 2 million tons expected to arrive in June and 1.3 million tons in July, indicating that short-term supply is relatively sufficient. Taking into account the news of tariff negotiations between China and Canada, the short-term soybean oil trend may be weak, and attention will be paid to future policy changes and the progress of the Canadian soybean anti-dumping investigation. In the medium term, the price of crude oil remains a key factor, and OPEC+ has increased production as expected, causing crude oil prices to rise instead of fall, reflecting the market's interpretation that the expected decline has materialized. With weak demand for biofuels, the dependence of oil on edible consumption has increased, but the second-quarter edible consumption is a lean season, making it difficult to promote further inventory reduction. As the post-holiday replenishment demand is sluggish, oil supply increases, and terminal inventory rises, the basis trend is weak, and the medium-term oil is still maintained as a weak view.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 07:28 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202506043421737854.html)\n\n**PBOC Maintains Supportive Attitude Towards Market Liquidity**\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) has taken measures to maintain market liquidity, including a 7-day reverse repurchase operation of 4545 billion yuan on June 3, with an interest rate of 1.40%. The PBOC also conducted a 7000 billion yuan buyback operation in May, with 4000 billion yuan for 3 months and 3000 billion yuan for 6 months. According to a report by Jinrong Bao, the PBOC's net absorption of reverse repurchase operations in May was 2000 billion yuan. In addition, the PBOC cut the interest rate by 0.1% and reduced the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5% on May 7, releasing around 10 billion yuan in liquidity. Experts predict that the PBOC will continue to maintain a supportive attitude towards market liquidity in June, with the DR007 (banking sector 7-day repo weighted average interest rate) expected to remain around 1.6%.

The stock market continued its upward trend in the first half of the day (June 3, 2025).

The uncertainty triggered by Trump's trade policies poses a risk to the global economy, and the OECD has lowered its global growth forecast for this year from 3.1% to 2.9% due to the uncertainty in trade policies.

Foreign tourists in China can use Alipay to 'scan' or 'touch' to pay, experiencing the convenience and diversity of Chinese mobile payments. Chinese-made products, from clothing and shoes to smartphones and vacuum cleaners, have become hot items among American consumers. Places like Yiwu Small Commodities Market, Shenzhen Huaqiangbei, and Hangzhou Four Seasons Clothing Market have become popular shopping destinations for foreign tourists. An American blogger named 'lulu\u9732\u9732' said, 'I bring empty boxes to China, not to sightsee, but to engage in 'reverse purchasing'. Enthusiastic netizens have also been advising foreign tourists online, saying that with Alipay and a canvas bag, they can buy anything in China. The 137th Canton Fair, which opened on April 15, attracted over 200,000 registered foreign buyers. This year's fair upgraded its low-carbon digital services and introduced Alipay's 'touch' offline service, allowing foreign buyers to access the fair's commercial and travel services with just a touch of their phone. This not only provides a green and low-carbon international exhibition experience for global buyers but also helps them to easily and happily travel and shop in Guangzhou.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: April 18, 2025 12:47 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250418/48226761.html)\n\n**China's 'Reverse Buying' Trend: American Tourists Flock to Purchase Chinese Goods**\nA 'reverse buying' trend has emerged in China, with tourists flocking to purchase clothing, shoes, and mobile phones. According to Alipay, in the first half of April 2025, the amount spent by American tourists using Alipay increased by 2 times compared to the same period last year. The number of tourists using Alipay also increased by 1.5 times. The convenience of China's travel services, including the 240-hour visa-free transit policy and the 'buy now, return later' tax refund service, has contributed to the rise of 'foreigners buying in China' as a new trend in cross-border tourism. As Alipay's representative, Chinese mobile payments have become more convenient and diverse, allowing tourists to 'scan and pay' or 'touch and pay' with ease. Clothing, shoes, mobile phones, and even vacuum cleaners have become hot-selling items among American tourists. Markets such as Yiwu Small Commodities Market, Shenzhen Huaqiangbei, and Hangzhou Four Seasons Clothing Market have become popular destinations for foreign tourists.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: April 17, 2025 09:08 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u7f51](http://tech.hexun.com/2025-04-17/218543441.html)\n\n**Historic Stock Market Shock: False News Report Causes $2.4 Trillion Surge and Reversal**\nA false news report on social media platform X caused a historic shock on Wall Street on April 8, 2025. The report, made by an anonymous account 'Walter Bloomberg', claimed that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that President Trump was considering a 90-day suspension of tariffs on countries outside of China. This led to an algorithmic buying spree, with $2.4 trillion added to the stock market in just 10 minutes. However, the news was later debunked by the White House, and the market reversed its gains in just 23 minutes. The S&P 500 index initially rose by 3.4% but then fell by 4.7%. Reuters and CNBC later apologized for their role in spreading the false news. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the market to false information and the speed at which algorithmic trading can react to unverified news. 'We made a mistake by reporting the news without verification,' Reuters said. 'We apologize for the error.' CNBC also apologized, saying, 'We reported the news without confirmation and corrected it quickly.' The source of the false report is believed to be a misinterpretation of Kevin Hassett's comments on Fox News, where he mentioned that President Trump was engaged in trade talks with over 50 countries but did not mention any tariff suspension. The incident also comes as China has threatened to take strong countermeasures if the US imposes a 50% tariff on Chinese goods. 'If the US goes ahead with the additional tariffs, China will take resolute countermeasures to protect its legitimate rights and interests,' the Chinese Commerce Ministry said.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: April 08, 2025 07:09 AM\nSource:[Haber7](https://ekonomi.haber7.com/ekonomi/haber/3520094-piyasalarda-tarihi-sok-ortaligin-karismasina-23-dakika-yetti)\n\n**US Consumers Panic-Buy Chinese Goods as Tariffs Loom**\nFollowing the announcement of the US tariff policy on April 2, American consumers have been frantically stockpiling Chinese goods before the policy takes effect on April 9. A 50-something local resident visited multiple supermarkets to purchase a Chinese TV, but found that they were all sold out. Economists warn that the tariffs will lead to higher prices, ultimately borne by consumers. According to a prediction by Yale University, American households may lose around $3800 in purchasing power per year due to the tariff policy. US supermarkets have seen prices surge by 30%, with meat prices rising from $80 to $113. Chinese TVs have become a hot commodity, with New York resident Peggy running from store to store to buy one. Some Americans have even waited in line for hours to purchase essentials like toilet paper and bottled water, as many stores have sold out or implemented purchase limits. Billionaire Mark Cuban has advised people to buy everyday items like toothpaste and soap before prices rise. China has announced retaliatory measures, imposing a 34% tariff on US goods starting April 10.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: April 08, 2025 06:52 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250408/48185017.html)\n\n**PBOC's MLF Operation to Adopt Multi-Price Auction Format, Injecting Net Liquidity into Market**\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) has announced that it will conduct a 4500 billion yuan medium-term lending facility (MLF) operation, marking the first time since July 2024 that the MLF has been used to inject net liquidity into the market. The MLF operation will be conducted in a multi-price auction format, which means that there will be multiple winning bid prices, rather than a single winning bid price. This change is expected to reduce the funding costs of the MLF and alleviate the pressure on banks' net interest margins. According to experts, the PBOC's decision to adopt a multi-price auction format for the MLF operation is a step towards further liberalizing the interest rate market and reducing the policy-oriented nature of the MLF. 'This will further reduce the policy-oriented nature of the MLF winning bid rate, highlighting its simple medium-term liquidity management nature,' said Wang Qing, chief macroeconomic analyst at East Money. 'The PBOC's liquidity tool box is becoming more comprehensive, with a more reasonable term distribution, and long-term measures such as reserve requirement cuts and government bond purchases, medium-term measures such as MLF and buyback operations, and short-term measures such as 7-day reverse repurchase agreements and temporary overnight reverse repurchase agreements. In the future, the PBOC's liquidity management will be more efficient and precise, with more scientific and flexible control over the pace and intensity of monetary policy,' said Wang Qing.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 25, 2025 07:27 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://jx.ifeng.com/c/8i0VG4xH0X3)\n\n**PBOC Conducts 14,000 Billion Yuan Buyback Reverse Repurchase Operation in February**\nThe People's Bank of China conducted a 14,000 billion yuan buyback reverse repurchase operation in February 2025 to maintain the liquidity of the banking system. The operation was conducted through a fixed quantity, interest rate bidding, and multi-price winning method. Specifically, 9,000 billion yuan was used for a 3-month (91-day) buyback reverse repurchase operation, and 5,000 billion yuan was used for a 6-month (182-day) buyback reverse repurchase operation. This is the fifth time the PBOC has conducted a buyback reverse repurchase operation since October 2024, with the previous operations being 5,000 billion yuan, 8,000 billion yuan, 14,000 billion yuan, and 17,000 billion yuan. The PBOC announced that it did not conduct any open market government bond trading operations in February 2025, citing the ongoing supply shortage in the government bond market. The PBOC had previously announced on January 10 that it would temporarily suspend open market government bond buying operations due to the supply shortage. 'For maintaining the liquidity of the banking system and further enriching the central bank's monetary policy tool box, the PBOC has enabled the open market buyback reverse repurchase operation tool since October 2024,' said the PBOC. 'The operation objects are open market business first-level traders, and the principle is to conduct the operation once a month, with a period not exceeding one year.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 01, 2025 02:44 AM\nSource:[China Finance Online](http://futures.cnfol.com/qishidongtai/20250301/31176705.shtml)\n\n**China's Central Bank Conducts 14,000 Billion Yuan Buyback Reverse Repurchase Operation**\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) conducted a 14,000 billion yuan buyback reverse repurchase operation on February 28, aiming to maintain the liquidity of the banking system.

According to the PBOC, this move aims to maintain a 'sufficient and abundant' cash liquidity in the financial system, as stated by the Xinhua News Agency. The reverse repurchase agreement, also known as 'reverse repo', involves the PBOC buying securities from commercial banks through auctions, with the agreement to sell them back to the banks in the future. In the foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan depreciated against the US dollar. The People's Bank of China's indicative price for the yuan was 1705.7 yuan per dollar, down 0.08 yuan from yesterday's price of 1697.7 yuan. Chinese regulations allow the yuan to fluctuate by up to 2% from the indicative price set by the PBOC in each day's foreign exchange trading. The indicative price is determined based on the buying rates offered by major financial institutions before the start of the interbank market's daily transactions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 06:46 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/economy/business/world-economy/28521)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is consensus that the New York Times is unlikely to mention 'reverse purchasing' (or 'reverse purchase') before July 1, 2025. Probabilities from the panel range from 3\u201330%, with most clustered below 15%. The forecasters agree on several core reasons: the phrase is a neologism primarily seen in Chinese and Asian media, with minimal penetration into US or Anglophone coverage; the NYT typically prefers well-established or native English terminology when describing new economic trends, and is cautious about adopting direct translations of foreign neologisms without clear viral or policy-driven necessity; and the short, approximately three-week window further constrains the likelihood. Moderating factors that could raise probability include the significant news value of US-China economic tensions and the behavioral phenomenon itself (Americans buying goods in China to evade tariffs), potential spurts in social media or wire-service pick-up, or a dramatic news event drawing attention to the trend. However, absent a major viral moment or broad English-language adoption, the base rate for this kind of term to diffuse into NYT usage in such a narrow window is quite low. Aggregating expert judgments and rationales, the overall likelihood that the NYT will mention 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase' before July 1, 2025 stands at roughly 10\u201315%, with the most common forecast (modal value) between 7\u201313%."
