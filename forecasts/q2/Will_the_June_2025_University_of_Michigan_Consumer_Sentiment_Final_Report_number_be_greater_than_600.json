Tariff and inflation concerns are acute and remain foremost in consumers\u2019 minds, as shown by both survey commentary and macro news. Labor market softness, declining savings, and general political-economic uncertainty further weigh on confidence. Base rate analysis shows rebounds after large drops rarely exceed 4-7 index points barring external stimulus, and the last such move (+8 or more) occurred in pandemic recovery periods or after major bailouts. The probability of breaking above 60.0 on the final June 2025 report is therefore quite low, though not impossible.

The expectations-driven negative spiral is compounded by labor market fears and inflation pass-through, which, in the context of the Expectations Hypothesis, means that aggregate forward-looking sentiment lags behind modestly improved or uncertain macro conditions. While possible catalysts for a surge above 60 exist, there is no current evidence of impending dramatic improvement, and the trajectory so far has been downward to stagnant.

The most likely path is a continued reading in the range of 51-56, with <20% chance for a significant jump.

Economists had forecast a rise to 52.0. The contraction is a reminder that the economy remains in danger of experiencing slow growth and high inflation. Businesses are facing higher prices for inputs, with the survey's measure of prices paid for services inputs surging to 68.7, the highest level since November 2022. The services sector employment picked up, but the government is expected to report a modest increase in nonfarm payrolls and a steady unemployment rate. The tariff uncertainty is making it difficult for businesses to plan ahead, and economists say stagflation is on the radar of many.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 02:20 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-service-sector-unexpectedly-contracts-in-may-inflation-heats-up-4081040)\n\n**US Economy Faces Challenges: Tariffs, Inflation, and Labor Market Uncertainties**\nThe US economy is facing a challenging situation, with declining headline inflation on one hand and potential supply shocks and persistent cost pressures from trade policies on the other. Recent data and global developments have reignited concerns about the impact of tariffs on price stability. According to current data, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) have been showing a stable increase, reaching $20.669.5 billion in April 2025. However, underlying vulnerabilities, such as declining household savings and increasing debt, raise questions about the sustainability of this consumption growth. The labor market is sending mixed signals, with strong employment growth in non-agricultural sectors, but a decline in job openings and unemployment claims. The average hourly earnings continue to rise, indicating that wage pressures are still present. The Federal Reserve is being cautious, maintaining a 'wait and see' policy, and adjusting interest rates based on incoming data. However, trade policy uncertainties are putting the Fed in a difficult balancing act, as tariffs can both increase inflation (supply shock) and weaken economic activity and employment (investment and consumption delay). If tariffs affect inflation like food and energy shocks, it could make it harder to achieve price stability and increase the risk of stagflation. The June FOMC meeting (17-18 June) will be critical in determining how the Fed will address these risks and provide forward guidance. A notable point is the divergence between household inflation expectations and market and professional forecasts. Household expectations, reflected in Michigan University surveys, are increasing, while market-based and professional forecasts remain relatively stable. This divergence is a source of uncertainty for future inflation outlook.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 08:51 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/yazarlar/ersoy-toptas/tarifelerin-fiyat-istikrari-hedefi-uzerindeki-etkisi--fed-bekle-ve-gor-politikasi-4430/)\n\n**What on Earth is going on with the American consumer?**\nThe American consumer is in a state of cautiousness due to the uncertainty of a potential recession and the ongoing trade war between the US and China.

The University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment improved in late May to 52.2 from 50.8 in early May, while the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month.

According to Axios, the US's declining reputation is costing the country economically, with a decrease in foreign tourists and a devaluation of the dollar. Morning Consult's director of political intelligence, Mike McKenna, warned that 'as people's views of the US worsen, trade and investment opportunities for US businesses abroad may also decrease, and consumers may avoid US-provided products and job opportunities.' The Trump administration's ban on international students is also raising concerns about potential losses for the US. The survey, which covered 41 countries including Canada, France, Japan, and Russia, found that China's net favorability score was +8.8 as of May 2025, while the US's score was -1.5. Axios reports that the Morning Consult survey confirms that the US government's excessive use of tariffs has damaged its reputation globally.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 02:12 AM\nSource:[\u661f\u5c9b\u73af\u7403\u7f51](https://www.stnn.cc/c/2025-06-03/3985774.shtml)\n\n**Breakfast briefing: More stagnation everywhere, more inflation in the US**\nThe US is experiencing stagflation, with the USD falling to a three-year low, gold rising, and US benchmark interest rates increasing. The week ahead will feature central bank rate decisions from Canada, the ECB, and India. The US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show a +130,000 increase, but the trend is 'ho-hum'. Factory and service sector PMIs will be closely watched for the consequences of trade war activity. The US has doubled steel tariffs, making its steel industry less competitive globally and embedding higher producer costs for American factories and higher prices for its customers. China's official PMIs show a contraction in the factory version, but a tiny expansion in services. Inflation pressures aren't evident in China, and Beijing has resisted Trump's request for a phone call with Xi. Other countries' PMIs show little change, but the trade war seems to be embedding stagnation. Inflation doesn't seem to be a problem, except in the US. Central banks in other countries can try a rate cut remedy, but this remedy is not available to the Americans. China is applying both monetary and fiscal policies to stabilise their situation. India reported a +7.4% expansion in Q1-2025 GDP, led by the construction sector and consumer spending. Canada also reported an expanding economy in Q1-2025, gaining +0.5% in the quarter. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey recovered its early month drop, but the level is very pessimistic. Job ad growth in Australia has turned into a decline, and the regulator ASIC found widespread compliance deficiencies in managed funds plans.

This is the first time the index has fallen below 50, indicating a contraction in the economy. The 5-month index was worse than expected by economists. New orders have decreased the most since 2022, and the price paid index has increased the most, indicating that the US is being affected by higher import prices due to increased tariffs. The ISM's backlog of orders index fell 5.9 points to 46.4, and the ISM's business activity index fell 3.7 points to 50, the lowest level in 5 years. The inventory sentiment index rose 7 points to 62.9, the highest level since July, indicating that more companies believe their inventory is still too high, which may pose a risk to manufacturing in the coming months. According to ISM survey committee chairman Steve Miller, 'Respondents mentioned that uncertainty over tariffs has made it difficult to make predictions and plans, and they are delaying or minimizing orders until the uncertainty is resolved.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 03:22 PM\nSource:[Wow TV](https://www.wowtv.co.kr/NewsCenter/News/Read?articleId=202506045905i)\n\n**US service sector unexpectedly contracts in May; inflation heats up By Reuters**\nThe US services sector unexpectedly contracted in May, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) dropping to 49.9, the first decline below the 50 mark since June 2024.

The report indicates that the final May consumer sentiment index was 52.2, higher than the initial value of 50.8, but the same as April, and at a historical low. According to the report, consumers' expectations for long-term inflation have also become more optimistic, with a 5-10 year average annual inflation rate (long-term inflation expectation) of 4.2%, lower than April's 4.4%, marking the first decline of the year. However, consumers still expect prices to rise 6.6% in the next year, slightly higher than April's 6.5%, but lower than the initial value of 7.3%. The survey was conducted on May 26, several weeks after the US and China agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on May 12. Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey, said, 'The data shows that consumer sentiment index declined in early May, but rebounded in late May after the US temporarily canceled tariffs on some Chinese goods.' Hsu added, 'Consumers believe the economic outlook is not worse than last month, but they are still very concerned about the future.' The survey found that consumers are pessimistic about their future income and still worry about unemployment. The personal financial situation confidence index fell to its lowest point since 2009. The University of Michigan's May consumer expectation index was 47.9, higher than April's 47.3, marking the first increase since November last year. Hsu also stated, 'Given that consumers generally believe that tariffs will be passed on to consumer prices, it is not surprising that trade policies affect their views on the economy. In contrast, although many media outlets have reported on the tax and spending bill being pushed by Congress, this bill does not seem to be prominent or attention-grabbing for consumers.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 04:36 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/5/31/n14521480.htm)\n\n**Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now**\nConsumer sentiment has hit the second-lowest level on record, with two-thirds of consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan anticipating unemployment to rise over the next 12 months, the largest share since 2009. This is a departure from the past, where the richest Americans typically felt better about the economy than lower-income groups. According to Hsu, 'It's becoming more clear from the open-ended comments it's not just about the magnitude about the tariff rates.' The survey suggests consumers expect a large shock to their personal finances, with many reporting weakening incomes. Despite government data showing inflation cooling and few signs of mass private-sector layoffs, consumers expect gloom anyway.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n**US Consumer Sentiment Index Falls to Historical Low Amid Trade War Uncertainty**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) for May 2025 fell to a historical low of 50.8, down from 52.2 in April, a decline of nearly 30% since January. This is the lowest level since June 2022, when the index was 50.0. The survey was conducted before the US-China trade war ceasefire and the final value will be released on May 30. Consumers' expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. According to Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center, nearly three-quarters of consumers spontaneously mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty affecting their views on the economy. Walmart, a US retail giant, has announced that it will raise prices due to the tariffs, citing that the current tariffs are too high for suppliers to bear. The company's CFO, John David Rainey, stated that the tariffs are putting upward pressure on the costs of imported products such as toys, electronics, coffee, and bananas.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 18, 2025 11:50 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=f6314deb-953b-4e4b-9922-67827e2f9f6f)\n\n**Americans' optimism about the economy is at a near-record low**\nAmericans' optimism about the economy has reached a near-record low, with the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index falling 2.7% to 50.8 in May. This is the second-lowest reading on record, just above the all-time low of 50 in June 2022. The index has dropped almost 30% since January, with consumers citing uncertainty and instability caused by President Trump's tariffs as a major concern. Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers, said, 'It's very clear that consumers are bracing for the uncertainty and instability of tariff policy.' Consumers expect tariffs to be painful, with year-ahead inflation expectations jumping to 7.3% from 6.5%. The current economic conditions index also dropped to 57.6, the lowest reading since December 2022. 'Consumers are understandably feeling a bit worse about where the economy is headed,' said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet. Economists had expected sentiment to improve in May, but the survey period ended before the recent d\u00e9tente and de-escalation in tariffs between the US and China. 'But these initial upticks were too small to alter the overall picture -- consumers continue to express somber views about the economy,' said Hsu.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 16, 2025 05:07 PM\nSource:[Aol](https://www.aol.com/americans-optimism-economy-near-record-143842493.html)\n\n**University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index: A Key Indicator for the Federal Reserve**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, a key indicator for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, is set to be released at 4pm ET. The survey measures consumer confidence and inflation expectations. While the data is expected to show a slight decline, from 50.8 in April to 50.6, according to Bloomberg consensus, the impact on markets may be tempered due to the release of final data rather than preliminary data. Consumer expectations for inflation over the next year may rise to 6.8%, up from 6.7% initially announced. The survey's component on inflation expectations over 5-10 years is expected to remain at 4.4%, a 0.3 percentage point increase from March and the highest level since June 1991. Safran, a CAC 40 company, is set to release its first-quarter sales figures, while Lagard\u00e8re, Spie, and S\u00e9ch\u00e9 Environnement will also release their sales data. The survey's results are expected to be influenced by the temporary reduction in tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, which may have a positive impact on consumer morale.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: April 24, 2025 01:55 PM\nSource:[Les Echos](https://investir.lesechos.fr/marches-indices/les-points-bourse/lenquete-du-michigan-barometre-de-la-confiance-des-consommateurs-americains-face-aux-droits-de-douane-2161713)\n\n**Americans' Expectations Plunge To 45 Year Lows As Democrats Send UMich Inflation Expectations Soaring**\nThe University of Michigan's (UMich) survey of consumer sentiment has shown a significant decline, with year-ahead inflation expectations surging to 6.7%, the highest reading since 1981. Democrats' expectations for a 7.9% surge in prices this year are particularly high. Consumer sentiment fell 11% from March, with the preliminary April sentiment index sliding to 50.8, the weakest reading since June 2022. Economists had predicted a decline to 53.8. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead has increased for the fifth consecutive month, with about two-thirds of consumers mentioning tariffs during interviews. According to Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, 'Alarmingly, though, consumers are now worried that they will be personally affected' by layoffs or income losses. The data suggests that consumers may not feel much relief from the April 9 social media post reversing some tariff increases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 11, 2025 02:09 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/americans-expectations-plunge-45-year-lows-democrats-drive-umich-inflation)\n\n**US Consumer Sentiment Hits 2-Year Low Amid Economic Uncertainty**\nAccording to a recent survey by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment in the US has worsened more than expected, despite the Trump administration's haphazard tariff policy. The university's Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) fell to 57.0 in March, a 0.9-point drop from the preliminary estimate released on March 14. This is the lowest level since November 2022, a decline of 11.9% compared to February. The CSI measures consumer confidence in the US economy, with a score above 100 indicating that consumers expect to spend more in the future, and a score below 100 indicating that consumers expect to cut back on spending. The University of Michigan's survey of 500 Americans across the country found that consumers are worried about potential economic pain ahead, with the CSI score of 57.0 indicating that they are more concerned about the future economy than expected. 'Consumers are worried about potential economic pain ahead,' said the University of Michigan. The survey also found that consumers expect inflation to rise to 5.0% over the next year, a 0.7% point increase from February, which is similar to the inflation rate in November 2022.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 29, 2025 06:25 AM\nSource:[\ub178\ucef7\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/6316166)\n\n**UM consumer sentiment index falls to lowest level in over 2 years in March**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 57.0 in March 2025, a 32-month low, down from 64.7 in February and 79.4 in March 2024. The current index fell to 63.8, and expectations index fell to 52.6. Two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, and year-ahead inflation expectations jumped up to 5.0 percent, the highest reading since November 2022. According to Joanne Hsu, director of UM's Surveys of Consumers, 'Consumer sentiment confirmed its early month reading and fell for the third straight month, plummeting 12 percent from February.' The expectations index has now lost more than 30 percent since November 2024, with a precipitous 18 percent plunge.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 28, 2025 08:14 PM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/03/29/um-consumer-sentiment-index-falls-to-lowest-level-in-over-2-years-in-march)\n\n**University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index Falls to 28-Month Low**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for March 2025 fell 10% to 57.9, the lowest in 28 months. This decline is attributed to the uncertainty of economic policies, particularly the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, which have raised concerns about a recession. According to the survey, consumers are hesitant to make long-term plans due to the frequent changes in economic policies. Joanna Su, the director of the survey, stated, 'Many consumers cited high uncertainty about policy and other economic factors as the reason for their pessimism.' She added, 'All three types of politically affiliated consumers agree that economic expectations have weakened since February.' The current situation index fell by 3.3%, while the future expectations index dropped by 15.3% on a monthly basis, a 30% decline from the same period in 2024.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 03:31 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250314_0003099822)\n\n**UM consumer sentiment index falls sharply in February**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 64.7 in February 2025, down from 71.7 in January and below last February's 76.9.

Consumers expect prices to rise at an annual rate of 3.5 percent over the next five to 10 years, with 40 percent attributing their inflation worries to tariffs. Expectations for personal finances and the short-run economic outlook declined almost 10 percent, while the long-run economic outlook fell back about 6 percent. Over half of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, and 40 percent blame high prices for eroding their living standards. According to Joanne Hsu, director of UM's Surveys of Consumers, 'Consumers' expectations for the path of inflation worsened considerably this month; they are clearly bracing for a resurgence in inflation.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 08:18 PM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/02/22/um-consumer-sentiment-index-falls-sharply-in-february)\n\n**Consumer Sentiment Soured at the End of February**\nThe University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for February came in at 64.7, a nearly 10% decrease from January. According to Joanne Hsu, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan, 'All five index components deteriorated this month, led by a 19% plunge in buying conditions for durables, in large part due to fears that tariff-induced price increases are imminent.' Economists were expecting the index to tick down to 67.5 from the preliminary reading of 67.8.

This surge in inflation expectations is attributed to Democrats, who are now at their least confident since August 2020. The overall sentiment has slumped from 71.1 to 67.8, with all five index components deteriorating, including a 12% slide in buying conditions for durables. Survey Director Joanne Hsu stated that this decline is due to a perception that it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy. Expectations for personal finances have also sunk about 6% from last month, reaching its lowest value since October 2023. Many consumers are worried that high inflation will return within the next year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 03:24 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/democrats-send-umich-inflation-expectations-exploding-higher-feb)\n\n**US Consumer Confidence Plunges to Lowest Level Since July**\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index (UMich) showed a surprise decline in consumer confidence in the US in February, reaching its lowest level since July. The index fell to 67.8 in preliminary estimates, down from 71.1 in the previous month. Analysts had expected a rise to around 72. According to Joanne Hsu, author of the report, 'there is a generalized decline in morale that has affected both Republicans and Democrats.' The sub-index measuring consumers' assessment of the current situation dropped to 68.7 from 74 in January, while the sub-index measuring their expectations fell to 67.3 from 69.3.

    "summary": "All experts strongly agree that the probability of the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index final reading exceeding 60.0 is very low. Across a range of perspectives\u2014including macroeconomic indicators, consumer confidence research, business cycle theory, expectations and behavioral economics, and political business cycle analysis\u2014forecasters emphasize several convergent factors driving pessimism. The index is currently at historic lows (May final: 52.2), with entrenched negative expectations due to tariff uncertainty, persistent inflation, declining real incomes, and widespread job insecurity. Most cite the absence of any major positive shocks or policy breakthroughs that could catalyze the 8+ point jump above 60 required in a single month. Historical base rates suggest such rebounds are exceedingly rare outside of major exogenous events (e.g., fiscal stimulus, trade d\u00e9tente, or dramatic central bank action). Behavioral and animal spirits frameworks further highlight self-reinforcing pessimism, loss aversion, and recency bias. Even possible modest rebounds or mean reversion are considered unlikely to make a material difference given the depth and persistence of current pessimism. The only plausible 'Yes' scenario described by all is a major, credible, and sudden positive development\u2014currently not in evidence. Probability estimates range from 2% to 13%, with most clustered between 5% and 8%. The consensus is that the index will almost certainly remain well below 60.0 in June 2025 barring a highly improbable, dramatic positive shock."
