Connolly's Death?**\nFollowing the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly, questions arise about what will happen to his seat in the 11th District of Northern Virginia. According to Virginia law, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin can call a special election to succeed Connolly, with the earliest date being June 24 and the latest being November 4. Most expect Youngkin to hold off until November 4, allowing party conventions or caucuses to select their nominees. However, given the early timing of the primaries, it is unlikely that ballots could be printed in time to select nominees for Congress in the 11th District. Connolly had endorsed Fairfax County Supervisor James Walkinshaw as his successor, who is considered a heavy favorite to be the nominee due to his liberal views and the reverence for Connolly among local Democrats. Other committed liberal Democrats, including state Sens. Stella Pekarsky and Jennifer Boysko and Delegate Dan Helmer, are reportedly eyeing the race. Among Republicans, former FBI agent Mike Van Meter has indicated he wants a second shot at the seat, despite drawing only 34% of the vote against Connolly last year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 07:57 PM\nSource:[newsmax.com](https://www.newsmax.com/john-gizzi/gerry-connolly-death-democrats/2025/05/22/id/1212046/)\n\n**Republicans brace for chaotic primary in competitive Iowa governor's race**\nIowa Republicans are facing a potentially contentious primary in the state's gubernatorial race, with Rep.

Here's what to know.**\nSix Democrats are running in the June 17 primary to become the party's nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor. The candidates agree on many issues, including repealing Virginia's right-to-work law, increasing the minimum wage, and protecting abortion access. However, they differ on specific policies, such as their stances on gaming and education. Alex Bastani, a retired economist and lawyer, is running to the left of the other candidates, proposing a slate of pro-worker policies, including raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour and providing free college to all Virginians. State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, a former literature professor and community college administrator, touts her six years of experience in the Senate, where she chairs the Education and Health Committee. Babur B. Lateef, a prominent Northern Virginia eye surgeon, has made opposition to a Northern Virginia casino a prominent issue and calls for eliminating skill games. State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, plays up the fact that he is the only candidate who has been elected to positions in both local and state government. Victor Salgado, a former federal prosecutor, bills himself as a political outsider with the integrity to resist the influence of money in a state with some of the nation's loosest campaign finance laws. Levar Stoney, the former mayor of Richmond, talks often of his underprivileged background and positions himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families and people in need.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/05/26/virginia-elections-lieutenant-governor-democrats/)\n\n**Why do Fairfax Democrats keep fighting for racism in schools?**\nThe US Department of Education, the US Department of Justice, and Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares have launched investigations into Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) for racial discrimination against Asian-Americans at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

Trump has mentioned J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio as possible candidates for vice president and president, respectively. According to The Hill, other names being considered as potential successors to Trump include: J.D. Vance, who has been speculated as a possible heir since Trump named him as his running mate last year; Marco Rubio, whose growing influence in the administration has fueled speculation about his future; Donald Trump Jr., who has hinted at a possible presidential ambition; Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who has been trying to repair his relationship with Trump after a personal feud in the 2024 primaries; Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, who is seen as a potential candidate to win in Democratic-leaning states; and Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security, who has been a strong supporter of Trump and was previously proposed as a possible running mate.

Notably, all Democratic candidates representing Fairfax County do not have Democratic challengers, so they will not appear on the June 17 ballot.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 30, 2025 07:53 PM\nSource:[Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/reston/early-voting-info-democratic-primary-fairfax-county)\n\n**Herrity drops out of lieutenant governor race, sets GOP ticket**\nFairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity has dropped out of the 2025 Republican lieutenant governor race due to ongoing health complications following heart surgery. Herrity's withdrawal clears the path for conservative talk show host John Reid to become the Republican nominee, finalizing the party's 2025 statewide ticket alongside Winsome Earl-Sears and Jason Miyares. Herrity emphasized that his priority was helping Republicans win in November and highlighted that his campaign was 'less about me and the lieutenant governor position and more about doing well in Northern Virginia so we could elect Winsome Sears as our Governor and reelect Attorney General Jason Miyares.' Reid said the GOP now has 'an early opportunity to unify behind a historic, solidly conservative, reasonable, and responsible GOP ticket' alongside Sears and Miyares.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 22, 2025 04:43 PM\nSource:[INSIDENOVA.COM](https://www.insidenova.com/news/state/herrity-drops-out-of-lieutenant-governor-race-sets-gop-ticket/article_1a73ef88-7ce1-5057-87cb-f0516cc534fc.html)\n\n**VA: Herrity drops out of race for LG, Reid is GOP nominee**\nFairfax Supervisor Pat Herrity has dropped out of the Republican primary for lieutenant governor of Virginia due to health concerns following heart surgery. John Reid, a conservative talk show host, is now the Republican nominee by default. Herrity stated, 'It is with a very heavy heart that today I am announcing the end of my 2025 race for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.' Reid said, 'I am sure all Virginians join me in praying for Supervisor Pat Herrity and his continued recovery.' The GOP ticket is now set, with Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears for governor, Reid for lieutenant governor, and incumbent Jason Miyares seeking a second term as attorney general. This slate is among the most diverse a major party has fielded in Virginia, with Earle-Sears being the first Black woman elected to statewide office, Miyares being the first Hispanic American elected statewide, and Reid being the first openly gay person elected statewide if successful in November.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 21, 2025 05:39 PM\nSource:[roanoke.com](https://roanoke.com/news/state-regional/article_f2774111-31ee-5bc4-bdbd-42ca24bcb791.html)\n\n**With Pat Herrity Dropping Out of the Lt. Gov. Primary, the 2025 VA GOP Ticket Is Now Set, and It\u2019s Quite Possibly the Most Far-Right/Extreme Ever**\nWith Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity dropping out of the VA GOP's 2025 Lt. Governor primary for health reasons, the Republican ticket is now set with Winsome Earle-Sears for governor, John Reid for Lt. Governor, and Jason Miyares for reelection as Attorney General. This ticket is considered far-right and extreme, with Winsome Earle-Sears making several controversial comments, including comparing Brown v. Board to the quest for taxpayer-funded segregated academies, and stating that the mother is not having a lizard, she's having a human being. Democrats are calling on Republicans to disavow Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears' comments on the Richmond shooting, and EMILY's List has criticized her for spewing misinformation about reproductive rights. Former VA Lt. Governor Bill Bolling has also stated that none of the prospective Republican candidates will be able to compete with Spanberger. 'It's the guns Ms. Sears\u2026IT'S THE GUNS! !'; 'Enough is enough. Do your damn job.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 21, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[bluevirginia.us](https://bluevirginia.us/2025/04/with-pat-herrity-dropping-out-the-2025-va-gop-ticket-is-now-set-and-its-quite-possibly-the-most-far-right-extreme-ever)\n\n**Big Bucks, big stakes: Virginia candidates raise over $20 Million as 2025 election season heats up - WTOP News**\nVirginia candidates have raised over $20.4 million in the first quarter of 2025, with Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger leading the governor's race with $6.7 million, nearly three times more than her Republican opponent Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears' $3.1 million. In the lieutenant governor's race, 12 contenders reported a combined $2.4 million, with Republican Pat Herrity leading at $540,000. Democrats Levar Stoney and Aaron Rouse are virtually tied at just under $400,000. Fundraising is a key indicator of campaign strength and viability, and the flow of early money offers a roadmap for where parties and donors see the biggest opportunities or threats. Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, noted that Stoney's strong showing is likely helped by a familiar fundraising machine - former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who endorsed Stoney's bid early on. 'McAuliffe's greatest skill as a politician has always been fundraising. And that pipeline will be very useful to the former mayor,' he said. The race for attorney general has also attracted big money early, with incumbent Jason Miyares raising $1.5 million and former Del. Jay Jones following with $931,000. Democrat Shannon Taylor pulled in $534,000.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 17, 2025 09:34 AM\nSource:[wtop.com](https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/big-bucks-big-stakes-virginia-candidates-raise-over-20-million-as-2025-election-season-heats-up/)\n\n**Virginia Lt. Gov. Candidate John Reid: 2020 Riots, COVID-19 Response Show Need for Republicans Who \u2018Step Up\u2019 in 2025**\nJohn Reid, a former Richmond radio host and Republican candidate for Virginia's lieutenant governor, stated that Governor Glenn Youngkin paved the way for Republicans to 'step up' and prevent Democrats from regaining control in 2025. Reid cited the 2020 riots, COVID-19 response, and election protests as reasons for his decision to enter politics. He praised Youngkin's efforts to veto 'horrible leftist bills' and expressed gratitude for Youngkin, Winsome Sears, and Jason Miyares' conservative leadership. Reid emphasized the need for Republicans to stand up for their values and push policies through the General Assembly, rather than trying to appease Democrats. He is running in the Republican primary on June 17 against Pat Herrity and John Curran.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 06:03 AM\nSource:[tennesseestar.com](https://tennesseestar.com/politics/virginia-lt-gov-candidate-john-reid-2020-riots-covid-19-response-show-need-for-republicans-who-step-up-in-2025/tpappert/2025/02/18/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts, drawing on diverse analytical perspectives including political campaign strategy, election law, retrospective and party identification theory, incumbency advantage, voter mobilization, and regional political realignment, independently arrive at the same conclusion: Jason Miyares is overwhelmingly likely to win the Republican primary for attorney general of Virginia in 2025. They cite an array of converging factors: Miyares is the incumbent, faces no reported GOP challengers, has met all filing and ballot requirements, and is universally described in news and official sources as the uncontested Republican nominee. Virginia's primary system and deadlines make a late challenge virtually impossible. The only imaginable risks (such as sudden scandal, health crisis, or disqualification) are recognized as exceedingly rare, accounting for less than a 1% probability in experts\u2019 assessments. Across all forecasts, there is consensus that the status quo\u2014an uncontested renomination\u2014makes a 'Yes' outcome (Miyares winning) almost certain. Base rates and historical precedents reinforce this, with no credible indication of party discord or procedural disruption. The final probability assigned by all experts is 99%, reflecting near certainty, with only the most unlikely events posing theoretical alternatives."
