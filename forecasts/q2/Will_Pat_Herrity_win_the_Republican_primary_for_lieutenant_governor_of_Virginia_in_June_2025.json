Even if he had a residual social base, it literally could not manifest given the legal and logistics blockade. There is no online or real-world cluster that could mount a viable comeback campaign; the infrastructure (ballots, party filings, certification machinery) is not just hostile but sealed tight. The lens of network influence is fine for cases of fractious second primaries or surging write-ins, but this is straight-up a question of ballot and party gatekeeping that even the most robust social network can't breach on this timeline.

In terms of election modeling, we're not evaluating a reduced field or a shrunken utility landscape: we're dealing with a dataset where the event cannot occur at all because the underlying process has been removed from the population.

Instead, Herrity's effective vote share is literally zero because he is not only not on the ballot, but the event itself (the primary) has evaporated for all practical and legal purposes.

Here's what to know.**\nSix Democrats are running in the June 17 primary to become the party's nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor. The candidates agree on many issues, including repealing Virginia's right-to-work law, increasing the minimum wage, and protecting abortion access. However, they differ on specific policies and issues, such as gaming and education. Alex Bastani, a retired economist and lawyer, is running to the left of the other candidates, proposing a slate of pro-worker policies, including raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour and providing free college to all Virginians.

Hashmi, a former literature professor and community college administrator, touts her six years of experience in the Senate and has already carried legislation to advance many shared Democratic priorities. Babur B. Lateef, a prominent Northern Virginia eye surgeon, has made opposition to a Northern Virginia casino a prominent issue and calls for eliminating skill games. State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored high-profile legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market.

Connolly's Death?**\nFollowing the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly, questions arise about what will happen to his seat in the 11th District of Northern Virginia. According to Virginia law, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin can call a special election to succeed Connolly, with the earliest date being June 24 and the latest being November 4. Most expect Youngkin to hold off until November 4, allowing party conventions or caucuses to select their nominees. However, given the early timing of the primaries, it is unlikely that ballots could be printed in time to select nominees for Congress in the 11th District. Connolly had endorsed Fairfax County Supervisor James Walkinshaw as his successor, who is considered a heavy favorite to be the nominee due to his liberal views and the reverence for Connolly among local Democrats. Other committed liberal Democrats, including state Sens. Stella Pekarsky and Jennifer Boysko and Delegate Dan Helmer, are reportedly eyeing the race. Among Republicans, former FBI agent Mike Van Meter has indicated he wants a second shot at the seat, despite drawing only 34% of the vote against Connolly last year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 07:57 PM\nSource:[newsmax.com](https://www.newsmax.com/john-gizzi/gerry-connolly-death-democrats/2025/05/22/id/1212046/)\n\n**Powerful Dahlonega state Sen.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has hosted a variety of guests on his podcast, including US Sen. Amy Klobuchar and his own children, who explained slang words to him. Beshear has mostly focused on dissecting and broadcasting opposition to Trump's policies, but has not ruled out a presidential run. Gretchen Whitmer has faced backlash for sharing a hug with Trump, but has defended her actions on the 'Pod Save America' podcast. Gavin Newsom has given a platform to MAGA figures, including Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk, on his podcast 'This is Gavin Newsom'. Newsom has also drawn criticism for opposing the participation of trans athletes in women's sports. Pete Buttigieg has appeared on Andrew Schulz's 'Flagrant' podcast, discussing his personal life and accusing Trump of failing to deliver on economic promises.

Their analyses draw on credentials in election strategy, polling, political consulting, sociology, political science, and regional studies, with each emphasizing multiple overlapping factors: (1) Herrity's formal, public withdrawal due to health concerns, (2) official confirmation from party and registrar sources that the Republican primary for this office has been canceled, (3) reprinting of ballots to remove Herrity's name and procedural finality around nomination, (4) the Virginia GOP's consolidation around John Reid as the uncontested nominee, and (5) the historical/empirical base rate that withdrawn candidates do not re-enter or win, particularly after all legal and logistical measures are taken. No expert finds any plausible scenario\u2014barring an unprecedented and highly improbable legal or medical reversal, which is unsupported by any reporting or precedent\u2014by which Herrity could re-enter the race and win. All conclude the probability of a Yes outcome is effectively zero, and every forecaster assigns a 0% chance to Pat Herrity winning the 2025 Republican primary for lieutenant governor of Virginia."
