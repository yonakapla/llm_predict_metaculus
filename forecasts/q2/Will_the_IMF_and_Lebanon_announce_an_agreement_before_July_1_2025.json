However, given my deep understanding of the EFF process, and Lebanon\u2019s record, it is rare for the IMF to announce a new lending program in such a short window from the opening of substantive talks\u2014especially absent full clarity on banking sector losses, credible Central Bank oversight, and committed anti-corruption reforms. The news reports about technical advancements do not mention finalization of truly binding reform benchmarks. There is ongoing risk of reforms stalling at the last minute, as seen with the recent loan withdrawal and repeated failures since 2022. That being said, the urgency is extremely high, and the creation of new committees and passage of some laws shows a degree of momentum. On balance, I judge this as slightly less likely than not to resolve Yes, but with meaningful upside risk: if the IMF opts for a staff-level agreement or political announcement in late June, it may just cross the finish line. Base rates for IMF-EFF deals in similarly crisis-stricken, politically fragmented states within months of negotiations are less than 50%, but not far below.",

Lebanon appears to be making some progress: recent reforms in banking secrecy laws and public sector oversight committees signal an effort to meet at least lower-hanging IMF prior actions. However, there is a lack of concrete evidence that the most politically difficult reforms, especially those affecting powerful financial interests and depositors, will be fully delivered within a month. That said, this is the highest tempo of technical and political alignment seen since Lebanon's 2020 default, and some external pressure to reach at least an initial agreement is evident. Staff-level agreements can sometimes be rushed if the IMF wishes to anchor reform, but the bar for a formal announcement involving new money is not trivial. Given all these uniquely sovereign debt and precedent-based factors, I judge the probability of an announcement (and thus a 'Yes') before July 1 at 35%.

The World Bank's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, Jean-Christophe Carri\u00e8re, led a delegation that met with the Lebanese Finance Minister, Yassin Jaber, to discuss the preparations for launching the 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP). The project aims to establish a special financial fund under the World Bank's supervision, which will attract funding from donor countries, international and Arab institutions to support Lebanon's reconstruction efforts after the extensive damage caused to its infrastructure during the multiple crises, particularly after the recent war. Jaber stated that the meeting discussed 'the technical and administrative issues related to the fund's mechanisms, as well as the legal rules governing it, which ensure the highest standards of transparency and accountability, enhancing the confidence of donors and financiers and ensuring the optimal use of resources in targeted sectors.' Jaber added that invitations will be sent to ambassadors of donor countries, as well as representatives of international and Arab financing institutions, to hold a broader meeting in Beirut on June 10 to present the project in detail and explain its objectives and operational mechanisms. He expressed optimism about the progress, saying that 'the start looks promising and free of obstacles, in light of positive indicators on Lebanon's restoration of confidence with the international community, resulting from a series of reform laws passed by the government and approved by Parliament in recent times.' He pointed out that 'the meetings related to the project will intensify in the coming period, including all concerned parties from local and international ministries and institutions, to ensure a participatory and integrated approach that enhances the chances of success and good resource utilization.' The move related to the LEAP project comes at a time when the international community is showing renewed interest in supporting Lebanon, but with clear conditions related to the implementation of institutional and financial reforms. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently announced that the progress in talks with Lebanon is still 'slow', despite the agreement on the level of staff that was signed in 2022, highlighting the urgent need to implement financial and monetary laws and regulate the banking sector.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 12:33 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%AB%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86)\n\n**Jaber: Movement of Funds to Lebanon is a Sign of Recovery**\nLebanese Finance Minister Yassin Jaber stated that the movement of funds from foreign and Arab investment institutions to Lebanon is one of the indicators of recovery after years of crippling crises.

He also met with a delegation from the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, informing them of the fund's intentions and readiness to finance several development projects.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 02:52 PM\nSource:[jadidouna.com](https://www.jadidouna.com/441261)\n\n**Lebanon Launches New Negotiations with IMF to Rescue Economy**\nPresident Michel Aoun launched new negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rescue Lebanon's economy. The negotiations began today between the Lebanese government and the IMF, with hopes of achieving a breakthrough that would pave the way for necessary reforms to put the country on the path to financial recovery. According to IMF's representative Ernesto Ram\u00edrez, a unified plan is necessary to restore confidence in Lebanon and accelerate the country's economic recovery. President Aoun thanked the IMF for their interest in helping Lebanon and emphasized the government's commitment to implementing reforms, which are a Lebanese demand before being a demand from the international community. Finance Minister Yassine Jaber said in a statement after the meeting: 'The meeting was good today with the head of the IMF delegation Ernesto Ram\u00edrez and the team, characterized by openness. We expressed the government's determination to implement all necessary reforms, not because anyone is asking us to, but because the country needs them. If we reform the electricity sector, it's not because anyone is asking us to or because we're being forced, but we'll do it for Lebanon and the Lebanese people and to stop wasting money that was wasted in the past.' Jaber added: 'Today, we outlined a roadmap and tomorrow there will be another meeting that will be attended by the head of the IMF delegation, the Minister of Economy, and the Governor of the Central Bank and those concerned, as you know, specialized meetings started on Monday with experts in the Ministry of Finance and the concerned ministries. The IMF does not only meet with presidents and ministers, but also with directors-general and specialists, and with the Central Bank and others to form a clear picture of the country's situation and the intention to put a program with the IMF. We presented to them the priorities we will start with, beginning with the appointment of a Governor of the Central Bank, as he has a very important role in dealing with the IMF, which will return to Lebanon again in early April if a Governor is appointed, or we will meet with them in Washington during the spring meetings that the IMF and the World Bank will hold. The cooperation is ongoing and we will work to reach an agreement and sign this program, and Lebanon will prepare during this period for all that will help achieve this program.' When asked if there should be a unified plan agreed upon by the government, Parliament, the Central Bank, and depositors, Jaber replied: 'Of course, and when I talk about preparations and reforms, it will be to enable Lebanon to have such a plan. There are many things we will do and laws are in place, but there are other laws we are working on amending, such as the Central Bank and Credit Law, pending the appointment of a Governor of the Central Bank who will start preparing for the study of the banks' situation and the study of the monetary situation and preparing a plan in this field, which means that everyone must do their part to reach this program that the government must commit to and defend and do all that is necessary for its approval and success.' When asked about the previous government's plan to cancel deposits and the IMF's approval, Jaber replied: 'I don't think there is any talk about canceling deposits. Now the talk is about how to return these deposits, and here I repeat that the issue of deposits will be subject to stages, the first stage of which will begin with small depositors who are the majority, and then we will move on to other stages. But let me say that we need the presence of all the concerned parties. I, as Minister of Finance, do not have the authority over the banking sector, and the regulatory authority for the banking sector is the Central Bank, and within the next two months, there will be a new Governor, new Deputy Governors, and a new regulatory authority for the banks, and we hope to be in front of a continuity to start working on analyzing the banking and monetary situation and all the required data to form a comprehensive plan.' When asked if the old agreement with the IMF will be canceled and a new agreement will be made, Jaber replied: 'Of course, we are responsible for putting a new plan.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 21, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[kataeb.org](https://kataeb.org/articles/%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%82-%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A)\n\n**Aoun Urges Cooperation to Reach IMF Agreement Before Summer**\nLebanese President Joseph Aoun emphasized the importance of controlling public spending and following up on financial and economic reforms during a cabinet meeting on Thursday. Aoun pointed out that a 2025 budget was signed during the previous meeting and stressed the need to monitor public spending according to Article 118 of the Public Accounting Law.

The committee will follow up on the points discussed by the International Monetary Fund delegation during its visit to Lebanon. Aoun emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer, stressing that this path requires cooperation between all authorities and parties in the country to restore internal and external trust, which is a basic condition for economic reform. He also mentioned the IMF's demands, which include the appointment of a new Governor of the Central Bank and the establishment of a unified data center (data center) at the Ministry of Finance. The IMF delegation emphasized the need to pass two essential laws: a revised banking secrecy law and a law to restructure the banking sector, which is a crucial step in the process of reforming the banking sector and restoring confidence in the Lebanese financial system.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[LebanonDebate](https://www.lebanondebate.com/news/689299)\n\n**Lebanon to Reach New Agreement with IMF**\nLebanese Finance Minister Yassin Jaber announced on Wednesday that there will be a new agreement between his country and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to a statement from the Ministry of Finance, the announcement came after a meeting between Jaber and the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Ramirez Rigo. Jaber described the meeting as 'good' and 'transparent'. Lebanon has been experiencing a severe economic crisis since 2019, when its financial system collapsed under the weight of state debt. The country failed to make payments in 2020 and ordinary depositors were denied access to their savings. In 2022, Beirut reached a draft 'financing agreement' with the IMF, but it was conditional on reforms that were not implemented. Jaber said, 'I expressed the government's commitment to implementing all necessary reforms. Not because anyone asked us to, but because the country needs these reforms.' He did not provide details of the agreement, but said the government is responsible for developing a new plan with the IMF. He added that the government has presented its priorities for the next phase to the IMF, including the appointment of a new governor for the Central Bank.

    "summary": "Forecasts from ten experts on whether the IMF and Lebanon will announce an agreement before July 1, 2025, cluster mostly between 35% and 43%, with two notable outliers above 60%. Across perspectives\u2014ranging from IMF negotiation procedure experts, sovereign debt advisors, international political economists, IR theorists, and Middle East studies specialists\u2014there is broad consensus on key factors. All emphasize Lebanon\u2019s dire economic need and a visible recent uptick in high-level technical meetings, legislative progress, and public political will, which moderately raise the probability of a deal compared to past cycles. However, nearly all highlight Lebanon\u2019s entrenched political fragmentation, poor reform implementation history, and legislative/bureaucratic bottlenecks as major obstacles. The short time window (1 month) and the IMF\u2019s usual insistence on credible, implemented reforms are seen as strong constraints, limiting the chance for a finalized and public money-providing agreement within the deadline.\n\nSome experts argue that the unusual urgency (post-conflict, reconstruction needs, intense international pressure) plus exceptional recent signals could enable a minimal, possibly phased or staff-level agreement\u2014thus justifying probabilities modestly above base rates (35%-43%). A few (notably those emphasizing international leverage, external patronage, and last-minute brinkmanship tendencies) judge the probability considerably higher (62%, 65%, 70%), emphasizing the strong incentives for all sides to avoid collapse and announce something before July 1, perhaps with the IMF accepting minimum reforms or a conditional first tranche.\n\nNo expert rates a Yes outcome as a certainty; all caution that risks of last-minute political blockage, elite collusion, or IMF insistence on true reform could still scuttle the deal. The most common scenario for No is ongoing technical progress but failure to get core reforms passed; for Yes, a compressed effort succeeds in enacting just enough legal and technical change for an announcement before the deadline.\n\nSummary judgment: While nearly all experts see higher chances than historical norm, the modal forecast is just below even odds, recognizing deep Lebanese institutional inertia and IMF caution, offset by exceptional present urgency. The probability range is 35%-43% for most, with a minority at 62%-70%, and the overall consensus is one of high uncertainty but meaningful (though sub-50% or at-best-even) chances for a Yes."
