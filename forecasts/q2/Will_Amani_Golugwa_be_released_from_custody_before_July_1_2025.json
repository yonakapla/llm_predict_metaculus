The October election increases government incentive to suppress opposition figures. International pressure can yield results (as with foreign activists), but so far only non-Tanzanian detainees have been quickly released under such pressure. Golugwa\u2019s stature and the high government stakes make a rapid release before July unlikely, barring a dramatic diplomatic intervention or health crisis. Nevertheless, public and diplomatic outrage creates a small but substantive chance for a de-escalatory gesture by releasing him on bail before July.

The legal justification for Golugwa\u2019s arrest is weak, but in politicized contexts, such procedural charges often enable months of pretrial detention. While recent cases of foreigners being released after international pressure offer some hope, Golugwa is a local politician, and such pressure is less effective for domestic opposition figures. International condemnation is high, but President Samia\u2019s administration is signaling that enforcement of preelectoral order takes precedence over appearances, and past cases of electoral-period detentions imply extended stays in custody. Without a significant shift\u2014like a major diplomatic incident directly involving Golugwa, an acute health crisis publicized in the media, or dramatic domestic mobilization\u2014he is likely to stay in custody until and perhaps well beyond July 1.

Recent cases (Lissu, Slaa, Heche) illustrate slow-moving legal processes and a lack of effective judicial independence. International pressure has, in recent weeks, resulted in release and deportation of non-Tanzanians detained for similar reasons, but not in the release of Tanzanian opposition politicians. Government incentives and the proximity of elections mean Golugwa's release before July 1 is unlikely unless pressure rises dramatically. Considering all factors, including a possible\u2014but historically low probability\u2014executive gesture or procedural slip, I assess the likelihood at 18%.

The Tanzanian state is currently employing systematic, election-timed repression against Chadema leadership, as evidenced by the arrests of several senior party members, party disqualification, and the pattern of alleged abductions and detentions. The timing \u2014 with less than five weeks before the resolution date and less than five months before critical national elections \u2014 means the regime has every reason to keep opposition leaders sidelined. International pressure is visible but has so far only succeeded in securing the release of foreign activists, not domestic politicians. There is no credible report of legal proceedings moving toward release, nor precedent for the Magufuli/Hassan governments to use symbolic releases for core opposition leaders so close to elections. Unless there is a dramatic shift in external leverage or a sharp turn in domestic calculations, the no-release scenario is overwhelmingly likely.",

Speaking at the 22nd National Prayer Breakfast in the capital Nairobi, Ruto reaffirmed Kenya's commitment to regional cooperation and peaceful neighborly relations. Ruto said, 'I address our neighbor Tanzania: please forgive us if we have offended you.' He also sent a message of apology to the people of Uganda and the youth of Kenya: 'Our friends in Uganda, if we have done something wrong as Kenyans, we ask for forgiveness. I also address our children: forgive us if we made a mistake.' Ruto's statements are seen as an attempt to ease regional tensions and strengthen diplomatic ties in the face of internal and external pressure. Several Kenyan politicians, including former National Assembly member Martha Karua, former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga, and human rights activists, were detained and deported by security forces when they arrived in Tanzania to monitor the trial of Tundu Lissu, the leader of the main opposition party Chadema in Tanzania, charged with treason and inciting violence.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 07:20 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ru/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82-%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D1%80%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%81%D1%8F-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4-%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B9/3582631)\n\n**Ruto apologises to Tanzania over activists\u2019 deportation row**\nPresident William Ruto has issued a public apology to Tanzania over the arrest and deportation of Kenyan activists, an incident that has strained diplomatic ties between the two nations.

He also extended an apology to Uganda and the Kenyan youth.

The two were arrested on May 19 while observing the trial of jailed opposition politician Tundu Lissu and were allegedly beaten, tortured, and stripped naked by people believed to be members of the Tanzanian military. Amnesty International's Regional Director for East and Southern Africa, Tigere Chagutah, said, 'For four days, these two human rights defenders were subjected to unimaginable cruelty. Their ordeal highlights the dangers faced by human rights defenders in Tanzania and there must be accountability and justice.' The pair's release and deportation followed pressure from Kenyans and Ugandans, civil society organizations, and intervention from the foreign affairs ministries of the two countries. Amnesty International is concerned by President Samia Suluhu Hassan's remarks calling for a crackdown on human rights defenders who come into Tanzania, labeling them 'foreign agents.'

The source, who spoke to 'Al-Ein Al-Ikhbariya' on condition of anonymity, stated that there are serious concerns in Baghdad about the resurgence of Ba'athist activity through new fronts. The source added that 'intelligence reports were raised during a recent security meeting, warning of a sensitive phase preceding the electoral process, which often sees dangerous attempts to exploit social and security crises.' According to the source, 'intelligence information indicates an increase in the activity of the 'National Iraqi Gathering for Liberation and Change', which is believed to represent the new face of the dissolved Ba'ath Party.' The source stated that 'this gathering is led by prominent elements from the regime of the late President Saddam Hussein, under the direct supervision of Jamal Mustafa Abdullah Sultan, the husband of Saddam's daughter, who was released in 2021 after years of imprisonment.' Jamal Sultan, an Iraqi officer with the rank of major, served as the second secretary to Saddam Hussein and his deputy for tribal affairs, and was listed by the United States as the 22nd most wanted person. He was arrested in April 2003 and had his assets confiscated in 2017 by the Iraqi parliament. He was released from the Al-Hout prison in southern Iraq in June 2021 and later moved to Arbil. The source confirmed that security agencies have carried out operations in recent weeks that have led to the arrest of more than 40 key figures in the movement, while more than 30 others remain at large. The confessions of the arrested individuals revealed a secret meeting held on May 23, 2024, at a hotel outside Baghdad, attended by around 30 leaders of the organization, led by Alaa al-Din, also known as 'Abu Abbas,' the secretary of the 'Iraqi Leadership Council.' The meeting was coordinated with two wings led by Isam al-Saffar and Jamal al-Nasri. In light of these concerns, recent security and political meetings have recommended activating the role of the media to uncover the backgrounds of the new organization, as a means of popular pressure on those who provide protection to these wanted individuals. The family of Saddam Hussein is seeking parliamentary representation. There is a vigorous effort within the family of the late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the city of Tikrit to nominate candidates for the upcoming parliamentary elections, in a move described as an attempt to return to the political scene openly after years of caution. However, this move faces internal conflicts and pressure from armed groups seeking to exploit the family's influence in Salah al-Din province. In response to the controversy, a statement issued by 'Tikrit Tribes' categorically denied any electoral alliance with Shia armed groups. However, the head of the 'Al-Zam' alliance, Mathna al-Samirai, announced the participation of the Bou Nasser tribe, to which Saddam Hussein belongs, in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Al-Samirai confirmed in a recent TV interview that the tribe has identified its candidate, who will be supported during the electoral campaign, in a move that represents a significant shift in its stance, after years of abstaining from participating in elections openly due to sensitive political conditions and security challenges. The Independent High Electoral Commission has begun sending candidate lists to 12 official bodies for verification of certificates, security records, and corruption, in preparation for the parliamentary elections. The move aims to prevent the repetition of irregularities that occurred in previous rounds, and to enhance transparency, amidst differing opinions; while some considered it a positive development, others warned of its use as a means of political exclusion. The commission relied on Article 8 of the Election Law and intends to publish the results of the audit and provide a period for appeals before adopting the final lists. The commission stated that it 'has referred the candidates' files to the Ministries of Education and Higher Education to verify the authenticity of their academic certificates, and to the Ministries of Interior and Defense, as well as the Counter-Terrorism and Peshmerga agencies, to investigate their security and military records, in addition to the Integrity Commission and the Supreme Judicial Council to ensure the absence of any suspicions of corruption or judicial decisions.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 12:23 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/baath-iraq-saddam-hussein-elections)\n\n**Ruto apologises to Tanzania over activists\u2019 deportation row**\nPresident William Ruto has issued a public apology to Tanzania over the arrest and deportation of Kenyan activists, an incident that has strained diplomatic ties between the two nations.

According to Oslo Freedom Forum, San Miguel's work in Venezuela has made her a target of persecution by the chavismo regime. 'HRF is pleased to announce the winner of the Thulani Maseko 2025 Justice Award: Roc\u00edo San Miguel. As a Venezuelan lawyer, human rights defender, and anti-corruption activist, her work has made her a target of harassment and persecution by the regimes of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,' the announcement reads. San Miguel, president of Control Ciudadano, is currently detained arbitrarily and accused of terrorism in a simulated trial where no evidence was presented, prompting international condemnation and calls for her release. The award honors the late Suazi human rights lawyer Thulani Maseko, a renowned democracy defender and former president of Oslo Freedom Forum, who was assassinated. San Miguel was detained on February 9, 2024, at Maiquet\u00eda International Airport while traveling with her daughter, and was linked to a supposed plot to assassinate Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and other high-ranking officials. She has been held in El Helicoide, the headquarters of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (Sebin), since then. Despite having a fractured right shoulder that requires specialized surgery, the authorities have not allowed her to undergo the procedure.

Among those detained were his personal secretary. Previously, 20 other municipal employees were arrested, including the head of the press office, on Tuesday in the same investigation. According to Turkish media, 13 of them were remanded in custody. Investigations are ongoing with \u0130mam \u00d6\u011flu, a prominent opponent of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, in cases related to terrorism and corruption. The decision to remand him in custody is linked to ongoing investigations into corruption cases. \u0130mam \u00d6\u011flu's arrest on March 19 sparked unprecedented protests in Turkey since 2013. He was removed from his position as mayor on March 23 and announced as a candidate for the 2028 presidential election by his party, the Republican People's Party. However, the cancellation of his university degree in March, which was condemned by the Turkish opposition, prevents him from running for the presidency.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 07:17 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/arab-and-world/2025/05/27/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%84-25-%D8%B4%D8%AE%D8%B5%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85-%D9%81%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84)\n\n**Niger Police Nab Village Head,13 Others For Allegedly Harboring Suspected Terrorists**\nThe Niger State Police Command has arrested the village head of Guiwa, Mallam Garba Mohammed, and 13 others for allegedly aiding suspected terrorists in Mashegu Local Government Area.

The opposition party, Chadema, said that Ng'wila was detained at Julius Nyerere International Airport in the capital, Dar es Salaam, on Monday. The police confirmed the arrest on their official Instagram account, stating that Ng'wila 'had a habit of traveling abroad and returning without following legal procedures.' This comes amid growing concerns about a crackdown on opposition leaders ahead of the October elections. Despite President Samia Suluhu Hassan's claims that the government is committed to respecting human rights and freedoms, a series of arrests has raised questions about her record in this area. The International Democratic Union condemned the arrest and described it as 'outside the values of democracy' and 'incompatible with public freedoms.' They called for Ng'wila's immediate release. The police had previously arrested Chadema leader Tundu Lissu, a prominent opposition figure who survived an assassination attempt in 2017 and came second in the last presidential election. He was charged with treason, rebellion, and disrupting elections after organizing several protests across the country in April, calling for fundamental reforms in the electoral process. Days after Lissu's arrest, the electoral commission banned Chadema from participating in future elections due to its refusal to sign the electoral code of conduct.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 14, 2025 04:24 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/5/14/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%84%d8%b7%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%aa%d9%86%d8%b2%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d8%b9%d8%aa%d9%82%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%b3%d8%a4%d9%88%d9%84%d8%a7-%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b2%d8%a7)\n\n**Tanzania Arrests Opposition Figure Ahead of Elections**\nThe main opposition party in Tanzania, 'Chadema', said that 'authorities arrested a key member of the party while he was on his way to attend a political conference in Belgium', indicating growing concerns about the escalation of the campaign before the scheduled elections in October. The president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, who is planning to run for re-election, said that 'the government is committed to respecting human rights.' A prominent member of the opposition party, Amrani Gologwa, was arrested at Julius Nyerere International Airport in the capital, Dar es Salaam, on Monday, according to a post published by his party on the 'X' platform. The Tanzanian police also confirmed the arrest, posting on Instagram that Gologwa 'had a travel document to leave the country and return without following the legal procedures.' The police added that the Dar es Salaam police zone is continuing to investigate the case in cooperation with other security agencies. Gologwa was scheduled to represent his party at a forum organized by the International Union of Democracy in Brussels. The 'African Democrats Union' strongly condemned 'the illegal arrest and attack on Chadema', according to a post on the 'X' platform, stating that 'silencing opposition voices is a violation of the essence of democracy.' They called for his immediate release. It's worth noting that the police in Tanzania arrested the leader of Chadema and the main opposition figure in Tanzania, Tundu Lissu, last month, accusing him of 'treason.' The arrest came after Lissu called for electoral reforms in a speech during a general meeting.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 14, 2025 02:34 PM\nSource:[\u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0646](https://www.almayadeen.net/news/politics/%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A4%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%AB%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B3%D9%84)\n\n**Tanzania arrests opposition official Amani Golugwa travelling to political conference**\nTanzanian authorities arrested Amani Golugwa, a senior opposition official, at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam on Monday as he was departing for a political conference in Belgium.

The case has been marred by delays and inconsistencies, with the High Court initially refusing to hear the case, and later ordering the Magistrates Court to prioritize the issue of bail. The Magistrates Court has since heard the case, but the High Court has yet to make a decision. Slaa's lawyers have expressed frustration with the delays, and have threatened to take the case to the Supreme Court if the High Court does not make a decision soon. Meanwhile, Slaa's health has become a concern, with his lawyers expressing fears that he may die in prison due to his age. 'If he dies in prison, the President will have to explain to Tanzanians what happened,' said John Heche, the Deputy Secretary General of CHADEMA. The case has sparked widespread criticism of the government's handling of the situation, with many calling for Slaa's release on bail.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that the probability of Amani Golugwa being released from custody before July 1, 2025, is low, with their estimates ranging from 10% to 20%. Their consensus is rooted in several consistent themes: (1) Tanzanian authorities have a strong incentive to suppress opposition figures in the lead-up to the critical October 2025 elections, making prolonged detention a strategic tool; (2) Historical patterns and base rates show that opposition leaders arrested on procedural or vague charges, especially in pre-election periods, are rarely released quickly\u2014prior cases (e.g., Tundu Lissu, Willibrod Slaa) involved weeks or months of detention; (3) Judicial independence is seen as limited, with courts often deferring to executive preference in politically sensitive cases, leading to prolonged legal processes or denial of bail; (4) International and regional pressure has occasionally led to the release of foreign activists but not consistently for domestic opposition leaders, so while global attention marginally raises the possibility of release, it is not seen as decisive for Golugwa; and (5) Some experts note a small chance for release if a dramatic escalation occurs\u2014such as substantial diplomatic intervention, regional crisis, or unexpected domestic unrest\u2014but currently see few signs of this. In summary, the experts collectively assign a low but nonzero probability for early release, mainly due to the convergence of political, legal, and institutional factors favoring continued detention during an intensified crackdown on opposition ahead of elections."
