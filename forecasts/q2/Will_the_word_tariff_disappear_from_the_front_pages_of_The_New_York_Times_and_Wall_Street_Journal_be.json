Given the July 9 reset, daily markets and political coverage, and high policy stakes, it is likely that tariffs will continue to be referenced up until (and possibly after) the new deadline. The best argument for a Yes is that a surprise, externally driven news environment (e.g., war, disaster, political upheaval) could occasionally crowd it out for one day, but this requires a perfect alignment of news priorities in both outlets and a lull in tariff developments.

However, the newsroom bias toward continuity and prepping audiences for July 9, along with Trump's volatility and market watchfulness, render sustained omission very unlikely. The highest chance for omission is during a slow news period when other issues crowd out trade talk, which tends to be temporary. Historical precedent (base rate): Coverage of dominant but recurring policy topics (e.g., US-China trade war, Brexit) can lapse briefly but rarely disappears in both papers simultaneously unless a true lull or major competing story emerges. Therefore, the chance that both NYT and WSJ omit 'tariff' for a single day before July 1 is not negligible, but remains less than even odds\u2014higher than 20% but not as high as 50%.

The '0%' statistical base rate in past US-China or NAFTA standoffs for dual front-page omissions until true resolution is a devastating datapoint for anyone arguing high odds of a surprise omission.

Your argument that editors might collectively pivot away only works if both suffer amnesia about the very market and policy audiences their entire product exists to serve. Even in so-called 'dull' periods, you get economy wrap-ups, political tickers, or sidebar blurbs\u2014places where 'tariff' lands reflexively. The base rate of omission in these conditions is near zero.

This change of heart comes after a meeting between Trump and European Commission President von der Leyen. Meanwhile, central banks are in the spotlight. There is anticipation for the publication of the minutes of the FOMC meeting on May 6-7, which will likely reinforce the message that monetary policy is well-positioned and that Fed officials want to wait for more clarity on tariffs and their effects on the economy before deciding to adjust them. Additionally, ECB President Christine Lagarde is expected to give a speech in the afternoon. The macroeconomic agenda is light today, but in the coming days, there will be updates on the US housing market, consumer confidence, and growth indicators, including the preliminary reading of the first-quarter GDP.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 01:52 PM\nSource:[La Repubblica](https://finanza.repubblica.it/News/2025/05/26/wall_street_chiusa_per_il_memorial_day-133/)\n\n**Trump Delays EU Tariff Implementation, Market Mood Shifts to Optimism**\nUS President Trump announced that the 50% punitive tariff on EU goods, originally set to take effect on June 1, will be delayed until July 9, after a phone call with European Commission President Van der Leyen. This move sparked a heated debate in the market, with many netizens joking that 'Trump has shrunk again' and 'he's changed his face just for the weekend'. Some even mocked that 'the Air Force was in a panic for two days for nothing'. According to a report by The New York Times, Trump posted on Truth Social on May 25 that he received a call from Van der Leyen, asking to delay the tariff deadline, and responded, 'Delaying until July 9 is my honor.' Van der Leyen also posted on social media, describing the conversation as 'good' and emphasizing that the negotiations will 'move quickly and decisively.' The NYT noted that Trump was unhappy with the EU's failure to make concessions within the 90-day window, and had previously threatened to impose tariffs starting from June. The news sparked a surge in US stock futures, with the market mood shifting to optimism. The US-EU trade war had been expected to cause market volatility, but Trump's sudden announcement to delay the tariff implementation has left many analysts in a panic, with some netizens joking that 'he's softening just two days after announcing it' and 'he's not doing well.' The delay in tariff implementation has caused a significant shift in market sentiment, with investors who had previously bet on a market downturn now finding themselves on the receiving end of the market's wrath.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 12:55 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/12806/8764187)\n\n**EU Seeks 'Good' Trade Deal with US Before July 9, 2025**\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that the European Union is ready to move quickly in trade talks with the United States, but will need until July 9, 2025, to reach a 'good agreement'. She added that she had a 'good' phone call with US President Donald Trump. Von der Leyen stated that 'Europe is ready to move forward in the talks quickly and decisively. To reach a good agreement, we will need time until July 9th.' This comes after Trump said on Friday that he is not satisfied with the pace of trade talks with the EU and threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all EU goods starting June 1. In early April, Trump set a 90-day deadline for trade talks between the EU and the US, which is set to end on July 9. Trump's new trade threats, which shook markets in the US and abroad, came after he accused the EU of being 'very difficult to deal with' in a post on his Truth Social platform earlier on Friday. Trump's actions regarding his recommendation to impose new tariffs on the EU and the US administration's frustration with the lack of compliance by countries and companies with US demands were revealed. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump's advisors have privately expressed their frustration to European officials about the EU's inconsistent priorities, which have hindered progress in trade talks. The US team has complained about what they see as a 'cautious and hesitant' European approach to presenting concrete offers to address US concerns, such as tariffs on streaming services, value-added taxes, car regulations, and fines on US companies in antitrust cases. The sources added that Washington has not yet received a commitment from EU leaders to impose tariffs on Chinese industries, which is a priority for the Trump administration in its efforts to escalate trade pressure on China.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 25, 2025 11:45 PM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5083402)\n\n**Von der Leyen and Trump Engage in Transatlantic Dialogue, but Tensions Remain**\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced a positive phone call with US President Donald Trump, rekindling the transatlantic dialogue on trade and tariffs. 'I had a positive conversation with Trump. The US and EU share one of the world's strongest and most strategic commercial relationships. Europe is ready to move forward with determination in the negotiations. To reach a solid agreement, we need time until July 9th', von der Leyen wrote on X. However, in Washington, the atmosphere remains tense. Trump has again accused the EU of taking advantage of the US, threatening new 50% tariffs starting from June 1st. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration's frustration stems from the slow pace of negotiations and the EU's reluctance to make concrete decisions, particularly on the possibility of introducing tariffs against Chinese imports, a key point for the White House. With the July 9th deadline, which marks the end of the 90-day moratorium granted to negotiate, approaching, Trump has intensified the pressure. Americans complain about the internal divisions within the EU and Brussels' too cautious approach. Sources close to the White House report that EU negotiators remain anchored to multilateral trade rules, while Trump prefers a transactional and muscular approach. 'For him - notes the New York Times - negotiations do not follow a scheme of reciprocity, but of unilateral imposition'. The list of American demands is long and ambitious: removal of the European VAT, relaxation of sanitary standards to facilitate the export of US beef, and changes to the regulatory framework for digital services and social media.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 25, 2025 08:44 PM\nSource:[il Giornale.it](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica-estera/dazi-2484587.html)\n\n**Wall Street Closed for Memorial Day, Tariff Decision Postponed**\nWall Street is closed today for Memorial Day, a day to commemorate American soldiers who have died in all wars.

As a result, the CAC 40 index is up 1.11% to 7,820.75 points, a gain of 86.35 points. John Plassard, investment specialist for Mirabaud, explains that 'President Trump has postponed the implementation of 50% tariffs on European products.' The president had announced on Friday that he wanted to impose new taxes on imported products from Europe starting June 1, before the end of the 90-day pause in tariff increases agreed upon last month to negotiate with trade partners. However, he ultimately changed his mind on Sunday evening, following a call from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 'We had a very good conversation and I agreed to move the date to July 9. (...) I agreed, and she said we would quickly meet and see if we could find a solution,' said Donald Trump on his Truth Social network. Despite this reprieve, 'the commercial war between the European Union and the United States could be longer and more tense than expected.

He announced this on Truth Social, according to Financial Times. Trump said in a statement, 'Today, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called me to ask to extend the deadline for the 50% tariff on trade with the European Union, which was set for June 1. I agreed to extend it until July 9, 2025.' He also stated that he had a 'very pleasant conversation' with von der Leyen. Von der Leyen confirmed the agreement, saying, 'The EU and the US have the most significant and closest trade relationships in the world. Europe is ready to quickly and resolutely advance the negotiations. To achieve a good agreement, we need time until July 9.' This conversation was the first between US and EU leaders since Trump's inauguration. It came two days after Trump announced a 50% tariff on imports from the EU starting June 1. Von der Leyen's office confirmed that she initiated the call with Trump. The newspaper notes that this statement suggests a possible shift in the European Commission's position towards seeking a compromise. Meanwhile, Trump's external economic advisor, Stephen Moore, stated that von der Leyen's statement is 'a very promising sign,' but 'it may not happen as quickly as Trump would like.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 07:22 AM\nSource:[\u041b\u0406\u0413\u0410.net](https://biz.liga.net/all/all/novosti/tramp-otlozhil-50-nyi-tarif-na-import-iz-es-posle-razgovora-s-ursuloi-fon-der-lyaen)\n\n**US Postpones 50% Tariff on EU Until July 9, 2025**\nUS President Donald Trump had initiated a global trade war by imposing additional tariffs on many partner countries. The tariffs imposed on China reached up to 145%, and China responded with a 125% tariff. The two sides later agreed to reduce tariffs in a meeting in Switzerland. Trump had previously suggested imposing a 50% tariff on the EU, stating 'I recommend a direct 50% tariff on the EU.' Trump had previously suspended tariffs on other countries for 90 days. Trump recently stated on his Truth Social social media account that there had been no progress in trade talks with the EU, and 'I recommend a direct 50% tariff on the EU starting from June 1. However, products made or manufactured in the US will be exempt from tariffs.' The 50% tariff was postponed to July 9, 2025. Trump stated that he had postponed the tariff after EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen requested an extension. Von der Leyen stated on her social media account that she had a good conversation with Trump and that the EU and US share the world's most important and closest trade relationship. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Trump believed the EU's proposals were not of the same 'quality' as those from other major trading partners, and that the US was hoping to 'move the EU' with its latest tariff announcements. The US had previously imposed additional tariffs on the EU, China, and other countries as part of a 'reciprocal tariff' agreement. China responded with its own tariffs, leading to a trade war between the two countries. The US had suspended its tariffs on the EU and other countries for 90 days, but the deadline is set to expire on July 9.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 04:05 AM\nSource:[Milli Gazete](https://www.milligazete.com.tr/haber/25091217/kuresel-ticaret-savasinda-yeni-perde-abye-uygulanacak-yuzde-50lik-tarife-ertelendi)\n\n**Trump Delays EU Tariff Implementation, Market Mood Shifts to Optimism**\nUS President Trump announced that the 50% punitive tariff on EU goods, originally set to take effect on June 1, will be delayed until July 9, after a phone call with European Commission President Van der Leyen. This move sparked a heated debate in the market, with many netizens joking that 'Trump has shrunk again' and 'he's changed his face just for the weekend'. Some even mocked that 'the Air Force was in a panic for two days for nothing'. According to a report by The New York Times, Trump posted on Truth Social on May 25 that he received a call from Van der Leyen, asking to delay the tariff deadline, and responded, 'Delaying until July 9 is my honor.' Van der Leyen also posted on social media, describing the conversation as 'good' and emphasizing that the negotiations will 'move quickly and decisively.' The NYT noted that Trump was unhappy with the EU's failure to make concessions within the 90-day window, and had previously threatened to impose tariffs starting from June. The news sparked a surge in US stock futures, with the market mood shifting to optimism. The US-EU trade war had been expected to cause market volatility, but Trump's sudden announcement to delay the tariff implementation has left many analysts in a panic, with some netizens joking that 'he's softening just two days after announcing it' and 'he's not doing well.' The delay in tariff implementation has caused a significant shift in market sentiment, with investors who had previously bet on a market downturn now finding themselves on the receiving end of the market's wrath.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 12:55 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/12806/8764187)\n\n**US and EU Prolong Tariff Pause Until July 9**\nUS President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a prolongation of the pause on the 50% tariffs imposed by the US on the European Union (EU) until July 9. The EU had threatened to retaliate with taxes on certain American imports. 'She just called me and asked for an extension of the June 1 date, and she said she wanted to start serious negotiations,' Trump said before boarding Air Force One. 'We had a very good conversation and I agreed to move the date to July 9. (...) I agreed, and she said we would meet quickly and see if we could find a solution.' Von der Leyen had previously stated that she had a 'good call' with Trump. 'Europe is ready to move forward with negotiations quickly and decisively. To achieve a good agreement, we will need time until July 9,' she said on the social network X. The EU and the US have the most important and closest commercial relations in the world.' Trump had stated on Friday that he was not 'looking for an agreement' with the EU and had threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from the 27 member states from June 1. The European Commission, which negotiates trade agreements on behalf of the EU, immediately reacted by calling for respect from Washington. 'The EU is fully committed and determined to obtain an agreement that works for both parties,' said Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic on X, after discussions with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. 'Trade between the EU and the US must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We are ready to defend our interests,' he added. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil urged the US to engage in 'serious negotiations'. 'American tariffs put the American economy in danger just as much as the German and European economies,' Klingbeil said in an interview with the Sunday edition of the Bild newspaper. The EU had threatened in early May to tax 95 billion euros worth of American imports, including cars and planes, in case of failure of trade negotiations with Trump. The Commission had also announced that it would take the US to the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the commercial measures it was suffering from the US.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 12:11 AM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2025/05/26/droits-de-douane-entre-les-etats-unis-et-l-ue-donald-trump-et-ursula-von-der-leyen-annoncent-une-prolongation-de-la-pause-jusqu-au-9-juillet_6608394_3234.html)\n\n**EU Seeks 'Good' Trade Deal with US Before July 9, 2025**\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that the European Union is ready to move quickly in trade talks with the United States, but will need until July 9, 2025, to reach a 'good agreement'. She added that she had a 'good' phone call with US President Donald Trump. Von der Leyen stated that 'Europe is ready to move forward in the talks quickly and decisively. To reach a good agreement, we will need time until July 9th.' This comes after Trump said on Friday that he is not satisfied with the pace of trade talks with the EU and threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all EU goods starting June 1. In early April, Trump set a 90-day deadline for trade talks between the EU and the US, which is set to end on July 9. Trump's new trade threats, which shook markets in the US and abroad, came after he accused the EU of being 'very difficult to deal with' in a post on his Truth Social platform earlier on Friday. Trump's actions regarding his recommendation to impose new tariffs on the EU and the US administration's frustration with the lack of compliance by countries and companies with US demands were revealed. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump's advisors have privately expressed their frustration to European officials about the EU's inconsistent priorities, which have hindered progress in trade talks. The US team has complained about what they see as a 'cautious and hesitant' European approach to presenting concrete offers to address US concerns, such as tariffs on streaming services, value-added taxes, car regulations, and fines on US companies in antitrust cases. The sources added that Washington has not yet received a commitment from EU leaders to impose tariffs on Chinese industries, which is a priority for the Trump administration in its efforts to escalate trade pressure on China.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 25, 2025 11:45 PM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5083402)\n\n**Von der Leyen and Trump Engage in Transatlantic Dialogue, but Tensions Remain**\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced a positive phone call with US President Donald Trump, rekindling the transatlantic dialogue on trade and tariffs. 'I had a positive conversation with Trump. The US and EU share one of the world's strongest and most strategic commercial relationships. Europe is ready to move forward with determination in the negotiations. To reach a solid agreement, we need time until July 9th', von der Leyen wrote on X. However, in Washington, the atmosphere remains tense. Trump has again accused the EU of taking advantage of the US, threatening new 50% tariffs starting from June 1st. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration's frustration stems from the slow pace of negotiations and the EU's reluctance to make concrete decisions, particularly on the possibility of introducing tariffs against Chinese imports, a key point for the White House. With the July 9th deadline, which marks the end of the 90-day moratorium granted to negotiate, approaching, Trump has intensified the pressure. Americans complain about the internal divisions within the EU and Brussels' too cautious approach. Sources close to the White House report that EU negotiators remain anchored to multilateral trade rules, while Trump prefers a transactional and muscular approach. 'For him - notes the New York Times - negotiations do not follow a scheme of reciprocity, but of unilateral imposition'. The list of American demands is long and ambitious: removal of the European VAT, relaxation of sanitary standards to facilitate the export of US beef, and changes to the regulatory framework for digital services and social media.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 25, 2025 08:44 PM\nSource:[il Giornale.it](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica-estera/dazi-2484587.html)\n\n**Trump Recommends NY Post Editor Take Over WSJ in Scathing Attack: 'It's an Easy Move for Rupert'**\nDonald Trump has recommended Keith Poole, the Editor-in-Chief of the New York Post, to take over the Wall Street Journal.

Such a change would be a GREAT DAY for America, but not a Great Day for China!' Trump has been critical of the Journal in recent months, particularly over its editorials warning of economic turmoil related to his tariffs. The Journal has run several editorials criticizing Trump's policies, including one in late April that warned his recent moves could 'sink his presidency.' The New York Post, on the other hand, has been a reliably pro-Trump publication, but has also opposed his tariffs, running an editorial in mid-April that argued they would hurt small businesses and Trump's own voters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 09, 2025 05:13 PM\nSource:[Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/trump-recommends-ny-post-editor-take-over-wsj-in-scathing-attack-its-an-easy-move-for-rupert/)\n\n**Trump lashes out at WSJ reporter**\nDonald Trump was filmed lashing out at a Wall Street Journal reporter on Air Force One, criticizing the paper's coverage of his presidency.

He went on to call the paper 'rotten' and claimed it was 'China-oriented' and 'bad for this country.' Trump refused to answer the reporter's question about his diplomacy talks with Vladimir Putin, saying it would be 'wasting my time.' This incident comes after a falling out between Trump and Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and the New York Post. Trump has been critical of the Wall Street Journal's coverage of his presidency, calling it 'polluted' and 'antiquated' in March.

In the first 100 days of Trump's presidency, the WSJ has published several editorials criticizing the administration's trade policies, including a 'war on commerce' that the WSJ called 'the stupidest war in history.' Trump responded on social media, accusing the WSJ of being under the influence of the European Union. However, the WSJ's analysis has been validated by investors, who have forced the government to pause tariffs on imported goods for 90 days. The WSJ has also criticized Trump's isolationist policies, comparing him to French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who had to shift his stance after two years in office. In contrast, other media outlets, such as CNN, have lost their influence, while the New York Times and Washington Post have been criticized for their liberal and 'woke' stance. Meanwhile, Fox News has gained popularity, and CBS has faced criticism for its alleged lack of independence in its reporting.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: April 30, 2025 05:15 AM\nSource:[LesEchos.fr](https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/editos-analyses/le-wall-street-journal-un-contre-pouvoir-inattendu-2162696)\n\n**'Different': Wall Street execs warn 'we've never seen' anything like Trump's tariff chaos**\nTop Wall Street executives are warning of economic instability due to President Donald Trump's tariffs, which they say is 'different' and unprecedented.

Some economists predict a recession by the second half of 2025. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said, 'This is different,' comparing it to previous market shocks and recessions. Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, agreed, saying, 'In the short run, we have an economy that is at risk.'

According to the Associated Press, Trump was reading the New York Post, a tabloid newspaper, specifically the four-page special feature on his tariff policy. The article discussed the pros and cons of the policy, noting that it may lead to increased employment in the US and Japan as major automakers move their production bases to the country. However, it also warned that tariffs imposed on Asian countries could lead to price increases for products such as yoga wear. The article also mentioned China's potential retaliatory tariffs and the concerns of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell regarding inflation and slowing growth. Trump has been known to favor conservative media outlets, and the New York Post is often seen as a more populist alternative to liberal-leaning newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post. Trump has previously expressed his admiration for the New York Post on social media and has even displayed a large front-page image of the newspaper on the wall of his Oval Office. Additionally, the Associated Press reports that Trump was also seen reading the Wall Street Journal while driving on the same day.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 08:31 PM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20250409/k00/00m/030/120000c)\n\n**Murdoch's Paper: Trump Just Made the Swamp So Much Bigger**\nThe Wall Street Journal's editorial board criticized President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs, stating that they will be a windfall for Beltway lobbyists.

Companies will seek exemptions to avoid these costs, which the Journal warns will be used as a way to leverage campaign contributions from businesses. The editorial board wrote, 'Mr. Trump is saying there will be no tariff exemptions.

The WSJ stated that the recent stock market downturn, which has wiped out the gains made since Trump's election, is not just a correction, but also a sign of underlying economic weakness. The newspaper pointed out that Trump's administration has been slow to respond to the economic downturn, and that his trade policies have created uncertainty and raised costs for businesses. A WSJ source said, 'The uncertainty over tariffs is causing customers to delay new orders.' Another source added, 'The tariffs are causing product prices to rise, and we are receiving large price increases from our suppliers.' The WSJ argued that the uncertainty over tariffs is also affecting consumer confidence, citing a decline in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, which fell last month due to concerns over tariffs. The newspaper concluded that Trump's trade policies are a major risk to the US economy and that putting them on hold would be a wise move to alleviate concerns about a potential recession.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 06:51 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250311124200009)\n\n**Journal de Montr\u00e9al's Provocative Front Page Goes Viral**\nThe Journal de Montr\u00e9al made a bold move on February 3rd by publishing a provocative front page during the growing economic tension between Canada and the United States.

The WSJ also mentioned that 'Trump sometimes says that the US should not import anything and produce everything domestically, which is not the world we live in and not the world we want to live in. Trump will soon realize this.' The New York Times (NYT) criticized Trump's decision, saying that 'tariffs are a means, not an end' for Trump. The NYT stated that 'many presidents have used tariffs as a means to negotiate, but Trump sees tariffs as an end in itself and is pursuing a 'Gilded Age' vision.' The NYT also pointed out that 'tariffs have almost always been used as a means to negotiate in modern times, and Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China without a clear reason suggests that he is not interested in negotiating.' The Bloomberg and NBC News also expressed concerns that the new tariffs could lead to higher prices for consumers and slow down the economy.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 01:02 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250202016800072)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse range of expert perspectives\u2014including journalism editorial judgment, media studies, economics, and political science\u2014the consensus is that the probability of 'tariff' disappearing from the front pages of both The New York Times and Wall Street Journal on any day before July 2025 is very low. All experts note that ongoing US-EU and US-China trade tensions, Trump's tariff-centric policies, the postponed but looming July 9 deadline, and the high economic and political salience of tariffs ensure the topic's newsworthiness. Editorial incentives, market uncertainty, and the continuity and prominence of the story reinforce nearly daily front-page mentions. Most experts cite historical base rates, showing that such central policy disputes almost never slip off both front pages even for a day while unresolved and newsworthy. A few allow for a slightly higher probability (up to 35%) that a major external shock (e.g., disaster or global crisis) could temporarily crowd out tariff news for a day, but characterize this as requiring rare, unpredictable circumstances. On balance, forecasted probabilities mostly range from 4% to 18%, with only one outlier at 35%. The overall expert consensus is heavily weighted toward a \"No\" outcome for the question, barring a 'black swan' news event."
