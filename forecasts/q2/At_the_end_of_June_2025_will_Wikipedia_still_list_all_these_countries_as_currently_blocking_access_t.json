Wikipedia editors are likely to react nimbly to such a clear and well-documented policy reverse. Historically, Wikipedia has responded to unblocking events at the country level within days to weeks, especially when NGOs report and mainstream outlets pick it up, as is the case here. Unless Pakistan's access is quickly re-blocked (which would itself be newsworthy and covered by NetBlocks), I expect that Wikipedia will\u2014by late June\u2014no longer list Pakistan as 'currently' blocking X. There is a non-zero, but very low, chance that delays in article editing, an 'edit war,' or short-term re-blocking could stall status change and thus preserve the Yes outcome. But these are not the modal scenario. Thus, the objective probability (using a base-rate adjustment for the rare but not unknown lags in Wikipedia updating) is that Wikipedia\u2019s list will lose Pakistan before July, making the answer No. My final probability for a Yes outcome is 11%.",

This event clearly decreases the probability of all eight countries being listed on Wikipedia\u2019s 'currently blocking' list.

The critical uncertainty is whether Wikipedia's 'Censorship of Twitter' will be updated in the next month to reflect restored access in Pakistan. Despite reliable reporting of this change and Pakistan no longer actively blocking X (after 15 months of a ban), Wikipedia's typical conservatism and editorial delay mean there's still a significant (although not majority) chance it will fail to update before resolution. Given this, but also the strong, recent, and well-sourced indication of a real change in Pakistan, I assess the most likely outcome is that Pakistan will be removed or flagged by Wikipedia editors, producing a No resolution\u2014but with a substantial risk that Wikipedia is not updated in time.

Given Wikipedia's update process, changes to the listing often happen swiftly for such widely visible policy swings, especially when covered by international media and testing organizations like NetBlocks. Thus, there is a high probability that Wikipedia will remove Pakistan from the 'currently blocked' part of the list by late June. For the other countries, the chance of removal is vanishingly low barring surprise regime collapse or revolutionary liberalization. The central uncertainty is the speed and consensus of Wikipedia editors; however, my own experience suggests that for major news, Wikipedia often updates within days to a fortnight.

However, past editorial lags, the possibility of partial or unstable access to X in Pakistan, and ambiguity around what constitutes 'currently blocked' could lead to conservatism or dispute among editors. All other countries are essentially locked in. Thus, the key forecasting hinge is: Will Wikipedia have removed Pakistan from the 'currently blocking X' table by July 1, 2025? Given the compelling technical and journalistic evidence of restoration in May, I assess there is a substantial, but far from certain, probability that Wikipedia editors will have updated the entry.

In reality, Wikipedia is notoriously uneven when it comes to nuanced or regionally contentious blocking/unblocking events. While NetBlocks and TechRadar are credible, Wikipedia editors demand not just technical evidence, but also sustainable, non-transient change\u2014and even then, disputes about whether a ban is 'fully lifted' versus merely partially relaxed can delay updates significantly. Furthermore, the proximity of the change (early May 2025) to the July 1 resolution date heightens the chance that the issue could be missed, downplayed, or get bogged down in talk page wrangling. Assigning only a minuscule 'delay/edit war' risk is na\u00efve given the historical messiness of such entries. Realistically, there\u2019s a far higher probability than your 11% that Wikipedia\u2019s list will lag or that Pakistan\u2019s restoration of X will not be universally recognized by the editorship in the short resolution window."

And that's assuming no promptly reimposed block, which happens more often than outsiders expect. You're right to highlight both the likelihood of a 'No' resolve and the nontrivial probability that laggy updates or editorial hesitation bumps up the 'Yes' chance. In short: believing rapid, frictionless Wikipedia updates in this domain is wishful thinking. Your 40% chance Yes is a much saner midpoint than some of the ultra-low estimates others are pitching."

Even with robust technical and journalistic confirmation, editors are notorious for demanding long-term stability before relisting a country's censorship status\u2014if there's any evidence of temporary or regionally unstable access, that can stall consensus. Add possible edit conflicts or talk page debates and a July 1 update is far from automatic. To bottom-line it: you've overweighted editor responsiveness and underweighted real-world conservatism and process friction in Wikipedia\u2019s infoboxes.

The technical evidence for X being unblocked in Pakistan is robust (NetBlocks, press coverage), and the track record of Wikipedia responding to major, clearly-sourced censorship reversals in the context of international news is stronger than I gave credit for. While editorial lag remains real and there is always a non-trivial risk of delay or dispute, the modal outcome\u2014supported by most domain and area studies experts\u2014is a timely update that removes Pakistan from the list. I overestimated inertia, and the risk is more with a brief lag or if a last-minute re-block occurs (which is not signaled in the news).

While the restoration of X in Pakistan is well-documented, Wikipedia\u2019s update process is still susceptible to slower changes in high-censorship contexts and could easily lag well into July. Even with robust sourcing (NetBlocks, TechRadar), there is a historically non-negligible delay or editorial dispute for entries involving volatile countries. In particular, the high variance in Wikipedia\u2019s response time for digital censorship updates (especially outside the core English-language focus areas) is a meaningful risk.

However, high confidence (e.g., 90%) is unwarranted since Wikipedia's history shows that even well-evidenced changes are sometimes delayed or mired in disputes, especially for politically ambiguous or recently reversed cases.

The policy aims to counter China and Hong Kong's increasing 'cross-border suppression' and political interference. According to the State Department, the new policy applies to foreign citizens who 'review or suppress protected speech in the US,' including issuing arrest warrants or requesting US tech companies to comply with content censorship. Rubio stated, 'We will not tolerate any foreign official crossing the border to interfere with Americans' freedom of speech, it's a blatant infringement on US sovereignty.' The policy is implemented under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which authorizes the Secretary of State to bar entry to foreign nationals who may cause 'severe harm to US foreign policy.' The State Department notes that immediate family members of the targeted officials may also be subject to the restriction. China and Hong Kong have been accused of using the National Security Law to exert 'long-arm jurisdiction' over dissidents abroad, including issuing global arrest warrants and pressuring US platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Meta to delete content or shut down accounts. The International Crisis Group has pointed out that the Chinese government is increasingly exporting its censorship regime overseas. In July 2023, the Hong Kong police issued arrest warrants to 8 overseas democracy activists, including those in the US, under the National Security Law. The Hong Kong government offered a HK$1 million reward for information leading to their capture and asked social media platforms to assist in deleting related content. In 2020, Jimmy Lai, the founder of Apple Daily, was charged with 'conspiracy to collude with foreign forces' in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media cited his overseas speeches and activities as 'evidence' of his crimes, calling on the international community to 'stop spreading false information.' Since 2018, Chinese companies like WeChat and TikTok have been exposed for cooperating with the Chinese government to delete sensitive content posted by users in the US, including topics related to the Tiananmen Square protests, Taiwan, Hong Kong protests, and Xinjiang human rights. The State Department has not yet released the list of targeted officials, but emphasized that it will continue to monitor and evaluate individual cases.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 05:25 PM\nSource:[Radio Free Asia](https://www.rfa.org/cantonese/world/2025/05/28/us-rubio-hongkong/)\n\n**US Restricts Visas for Foreigners Who Censor Americans on Social Media**\nThe US Embassy in Brazil detailed the new policy of the Trump administration to restrict the issuance of visas to foreigners who, according to the White House, try to censor Americans on social media. In a statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio highlighted the restriction, which is provided for in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The measure also affects family members of the person targeted by the restrictions. According to the statement sent by the Embassy, the change is based on the right to freedom of expression. 'This right, legally enshrined in our Constitution, has made us a beacon of freedom for the world. Even as we act to reject censorship in our country, we observe disturbing cases of governments and foreign authorities adopting this practice,' Rubio said. He also cited cases of 'foreign authorities' taking censorship measures against technology companies and US citizens and residents 'when they had no authority to do so.' Recently, Elon Musk, owner of X, was at the center of a controversy with Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes. The minister blocked X in Brazil last year on August 30, after the company closed its office in Brazil and left without a legal representative. The unblocking only occurred in October, after Musk paid R$ 28.6 million in fine. At the time, the billionaire American, who had previously joined the Trump government, announced the closure of the company's headquarters in Brazil after the network was fined for refusing to comply with the order to remove from the air profiles of investigated by the Court for the publication of messages considered antidemocratic. 'It is unacceptable that foreign authorities issue or threaten to issue arrest warrants against US citizens or residents for posts on social media made on American platforms while physically present in American soil,' Rubio detailed, in the statement. The White House Secretary also classified as 'unacceptable' that foreign authorities demand that US technology platforms adopt global content moderation policies or become involved in censorship actions that reach the US. 'We will not tolerate violations of American sovereignty, especially when these violations compromise the exercise of our fundamental right to freedom of expression,' he concluded.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[O TEMPO](https://www.otempo.com.br/mundo/2025/5/28/secretario-de-trump-explica-politica-de-restricao-a-vistos-a-estrangeiros-que-censuram-americanos)\n\n**Indian 'X' accounts withheld after Operation Sindoor restored**\nThe Indian government has unblocked access to many Indian and non-Pakistani accounts on X, formerly Twitter, that were restricted due to Operation Sindoor. The move came before a court hearing, where the accounts were to challenge their censorship. Arpit Sharma, a content creator with 3.4 lakh followers on Instagram, had his X account withheld on May 8, but it was restored on May 17. 'Just before our case was to be listed [in the Supreme Court], my account got restored,' Mr. Sharma said. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology did not respond to a query regarding the accounts' blocking. The Software Freedom Law Centre, India (SFLC) has filed a PIL in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of Rule 16 and the reading down of Rules 8 and 9 of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009, for violating Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution.

Hackers allegedly infiltrated the Tanzania Police's X account, posting prank content and sexual material, which has since been taken down. The Tanzania Revenue Authority's account was also targeted, leading to speculation of a coordinated attack on government entities. Critics believe the government is using the situation to clamp down on critics, with one critic stating, 'They shut down the internet because of the evil acts happening.' The government has been accused of human rights violations, including arrests, detention, and torture of opposition members.

The policy aims to restrict visas for foreign officials who block or regulate American social media posts, which could be seen as 'censoring Americans'. This move is seen as a countermeasure to the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires major social media platforms to implement stricter content moderation policies. Rubio stated, 'Today, I am announcing a new visa restriction policy targeting foreign nationals who are responsible for censoring protected expression in the United States. Foreign officials who issue arrest warrants or threaten to arrest Americans for social media posts on American platforms, or who demand the adoption of global content moderation policies that extend beyond their authority, will not be tolerated.' The new policy does not specify which cases will be targeted, but it is believed to be a response to the EU's Digital Services Act, which designates X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and YouTube as 'large online platforms' and requires them to take strict action against hate speech and child exploitation content. US Vice President J.D. Vance has previously criticized the EU's 'authoritarian censorship' for harming the US technology industry, and the Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the EU's social media regulations. The US State Department's website now features a link to an op-ed by Senior Adviser to the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Samuel Samson, who criticizes the Digital Services Act as 'using content moderation to silence dissenting voices in a George Orwellian manner.' Samson also notes that independent regulatory agencies are currently monitoring social media companies, including X, and threatening to impose heavy fines if they violate free speech regulations.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: May 29, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[GIGAZINE](https://gigazine.net/news/20250529-visa-restriction-policy-censor-americans/)\n\n**Fmr State Dept official Mike Benz exposes foreign plot to take back control over X**\nFormer State Department official Mike Benz has warned of an international plot to regain control over American social media platforms.

According to media reports, the government has instructed social media companies to remove over 1,000 posts per day under the IT Act. The Electronics and IT Ministry has also held high-level meetings with social media companies to address this issue. X has blocked access to the accounts of Pakistani actors Fawad Khan, Atif Aslam, and Hania Aamir, as well as cricketers Babar Azam and Shahid Afridi, in India. The government has also ordered the blocking of 8,000 X accounts, including those of international news organizations. X has stated that it does not agree with the government's decision, but will comply with the order to prevent the display of these posts and accounts only in India. The government claims that this action is being taken to strengthen national security and cybersecurity, and to prevent the spread of false information and propaganda against India. Some accounts have been accused of spreading misinformation and instability in India. The Indian government has also instructed OTT platforms to remove Pakistani content, citing national security concerns. This move is seen as a response to the growing tensions between India and Pakistan. X has also blocked 2.30 lakh Indian accounts in April-May, citing reasons such as child exploitation and non-consensual nudity. The company has also processed 76 complaints related to account suspension. This is not the first time that the Indian government has taken action against Pakistani content on social media. In 2016, the government banned Pakistani artists from working in India after the Uri attack. However, in 2023, the Bombay High Court ruled that artists cannot be punished for political tensions. Since then, Pakistani artists have been allowed to work in India again. X has also removed 1.84 lakh accounts in March-April, citing reasons such as terrorism and child exploitation. The company has also removed 213,862 accounts in February-March, including 1,235 accounts accused of promoting terrorism. \nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: May 09, 2025 02:41 PM\nSource:[Money Bhaskar](https://money.bhaskar.com/business/news/social-media-platforms-meta-x-step-up-content-takedowns-in-india-134995334.html)\n\n**Pakistan has restored X access after a 15-month ban - here's everything we know so far**\nPakistan has restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban, which was enforced in February 2024 due to the platform being 'used to draw attention to instances of alleged election fraud.' According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, metrics show that access to X has been restored in Pakistan, allowing citizens to access the platform without the need for a virtual private network (VPN).

The key opposition figure has been accused of involvement in terrorism, bribery, and fraud, which he denies. His supporters believe that the government is trying to prevent him from participating in the elections. Many people involved in the protests have found that their X accounts have been blocked, including activists who shared information about the protests and locations where people could gather. According to Yusuf Kan, coordinator and analyst of the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center, many of these accounts had tens of thousands of followers. Activist Omer Faruk Aslan created a second account to avoid censorship, saying, 'My account was blocked by court order because the number of tweet views exceeded 6 million.' Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya stated that the authorities found 326 social media accounts that 'incited hatred,' 72 of which were allegedly located abroad. 54 people were arrested for allegedly being connected to these accounts. From a local law perspective, suspending accounts is not a violation, as local rules allow such actions at the government's request. The 2022 Social Media Law provides the government with broad and vague powers to suppress content. Social media platforms like X essentially have no choice: either comply with the request or face a complete block in the country. This is not the first time X has restricted access to content in Turkey. For example, a large portion of content was blocked in 2023 when President Erdogan was running for re-election and won. According to transparency reports, in the second half of 2024, X fulfilled around 86% of the Turkish government's requests to remove content, compared to 68% in the first half of the year. Although the removal rate is lower than in the European Union, where it reached 90% in the second half of 2024, Turkish authorities submit around six times more requests to remove content per capita.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 24, 2025 08:37 AM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/tech/ru/x-ilona-maska-blokiruet-oppoziciju-v-turcii-vo-vremja-protestov-tehno_n2782758)\n\n**X Challenges Indian Government's Censorship Powers**\nElon Musk's social media platform X has filed a case against the Indian government for using control orders to remove social media content.

This is the latest challenge to the Indian government's censorship powers by X, which has recently entered the world's fifth-largest economy with its Starlink and Tesla. The government has used a major legal provision to issue orders to block the case, which X alleges is being misused to create parallel surveillance systems that ignore existing security measures. 'According to X, this provision... is being misused to create parallel surveillance systems that are being used to block information,' reported Bar & Bench, a Indian legal news website. The case will be heard by a court in the southern state of Karnataka on March 27. Musk's social media platform is not new to legal battles in India. In 2023, the Indian court rejected an appeal by X to challenge an order to remove tweets and accounts criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and imposed a fine of $61,000 on the platform. Almost a year later, X said it was challenging an order to block 'specific accounts and posts' by the government. 'We have a written appeal challenging the blocking orders of the Indian government. We have also informed affected users of these actions in accordance with our policies,' the company said in February 2024. 'We believe that publishing these orders is necessary for transparency, but we are unable to publish them due to legal restrictions, which can lead to a lack of accountability and arbitrary decision-making.'\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: March 21, 2025 01:54 PM\nSource:[Online Khabar](https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2025/03/1646297/social-network-x-files-lawsuit-against-indian-government)\n\n**X approaches HC over Centre using IT Act to block content**\nX, formerly Twitter, has filed a petition in the Karnataka high court challenging the Indian government's use of Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, arguing that it sets up an illegal parallel content-blocking process and violates the Supreme Court's 2015 Shreya Singhal judgment. The company claims that government authorities are misusing this section to bypass the safeguards of Section 69A and arbitrarily censor online content. X wants the court to stop the government from acting against the company for orders that do not comply with Section 69A and to protect the company from onboarding an employee on the Sahyog portal, which X calls a 'Censorship Portal'. The company argues that multiple Union ministries have issued notifications designating nodal officers under Section 79(3)(b) to demand content removals, which are unconstitutional and must be quashed. X also claims that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is unlawfully facilitating this parallel system. The company is seeking to prevent the government's misuse of Section 79(3)(b) and create a censorship system without checks and balances.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/x-approaches-hc-over-centre-using-it-act-to-block-content-101742412191170.html)\n\n**The value of X**\nPakistan continues to block social media platform X (formerly Twitter), despite mounting legal and public pressure. The Lahore High Court is currently hearing petitions challenging the ban, which argue that restricting access to X violates Articles 19 and 19-A of the constitution, guaranteeing freedom of expression and access to information. The court has questioned why government institutions and officials, including the prime minister, continue to use X despite its official prohibition. The ban was imposed in early 2024 under the caretaker government, but its justification, citing confidential reports from intelligence agencies, is unconvincing and reeks of political expediency. The government's actions suggest an intent to normalise digital censorship under the guise of security, which is unacceptable. Free speech and access to information are fundamental to democracy, and an open digital space is crucial for political discourse. The ban on X should not become the new normal, and the government should engage in democratic debate, address misinformation through transparency, and strengthen public trust. Censorship is not the solution; dialogue and accountability are.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[thenews.com.pk](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1292447-the-value-of-x)\n\n**Trump Administration Considers Restricting Entry of Citizens from 43 Countries**\nThe Trump administration is considering restricting the entry of citizens from 43 countries, including North Korea, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, according to a report by The New York Times. The State Department has drafted a plan to categorize the countries into three levels: 'red', 'orange', and 'yellow'. The 'red' list includes 11 countries, including North Korea, Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, where citizens are completely banned from entering the US. The 'orange' list includes 10 countries, including Belarus, Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Turkmenistan, where business travelers may be allowed to enter the US, but immigrants or tourists are not. The 'yellow' list includes 22 countries, which may be moved to the 'red' or 'orange' list if they do not resolve the issues raised by the US within 60 days. The State Department plans to submit the finalized list to the White House by next week. It is unclear whether the list will affect the validity of existing visas or green cards held by citizens of the listed countries.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 15, 2025 10:40 AM\nSource:[KBS](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/pc/view/view.do?ncd=8201328)\n\n**Digital Censorship in Venezuela Continues to Rise, Says VE sin Filtro**\nDigital censorship in Venezuela has increased significantly over the past decade, affecting internet connectivity, access to information, and freedom of expression. According to data from VE sin Filtro, there have been 1,335 website blockages since 2016, with 949 still active, mainly affecting media outlets and digital platforms. The report reveals that 134 websites remain inaccessible in the country, with 60 belonging to media outlets. Additionally, 228 domains have been blocked, a practice that hinders citizens' ability to freely inform and communicate in the digital environment. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Wikipedia, and the encrypted messaging app Signal have been restricted, along with public DNS servers and VPN websites. In January 2025, 98 blockages were recorded against 32 IP addresses belonging to server companies, leaving many users without access. VE sin Filtro warns that these blockages not only affect freedom of expression but also undermine the right to access information in a context of political and social crisis. The organization notes that internet service providers, both public and private, continue to follow government guidelines that limit digital civic space. The report is presented on World Day Against Internet Censorship and highlights the impact of these restrictions on Venezuelan society. The lack of access to information and digital platforms limits the exercise of fundamental rights and exacerbates citizens' isolation in an increasingly controlled environment.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 11:21 PM\nSource:[Noticiero Digital](https://noticierodigital.com/2025/03/la-censura-digital-en-venezuela-sigue-en-aumento-segun-ve-sin-filtro/)\n\n**VE sin Filtro: Censorship and Repression in Venezuela's Digital Space**\nBetween January 2016 and January 2025, Ve sin Filtro registered 1,335 events of internet service providers blocking websites in Venezuela. Currently, 949 of these events are active, blocking access to 134 websites, 60 of which are media outlets. According to Ve sin Filtro, 'these blocks are severe restrictions on the exercise of human rights, especially the right to freedom of expression and access to information.' The Venezuelan government's continued policy of restricting access to information and new technologies is a critical example of the reduction and censorship of the digital civic space. The blocking of platforms such as X/Twitter, TikTok, Wikipedia, and VPN sites, which are used to evade censorship, is of particular concern. In January 2025 alone, 32 DNS public servers were blocked, mainly by the state-owned CANTV, making it difficult for users to navigate the internet and increasing censorship. Ve sin Filtro reiterates that 'the blocks in the internet are violators of human rights, and in the case of Venezuela, access to information is fundamental due to the complex political and social dynamics that the country experiences, as well as the censorship and weakening of traditional media communication outlets.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[LaPatilla.com](https://www.lapatilla.com/2025/03/12/ve-sin-filtro-casi-mil-bloqueos-contra-sitios-web-tejen-red-de-censura-oficial-en-venezuela/)\n\n**Pakistan's Predicament: A Test of Musk's Starlink Service**\nPakistani politician Priyanka Chaturvedi's hint, Elon Musk's agreement, and Pakistan's predicament. Pakistan had already banned X (formerly Twitter) before. In January, when internet speed in Pakistan slowed down, some people tagged Elon Musk on Twitter, asking him to provide Starlink service. Musk replied that Starlink was waiting for approval from the Pakistani government. Since then, the world has changed. At least in global politics, Elon Musk has become a central figure. After becoming the Department of Government Efficiency (DoGE) head in Donald Trump's team, Musk targeted England, calling for the removal of PM Rishi Sunak. Behind this was Pakistan. Musk had raised the issue of sexual assault of girls 15 years ago. At that time, Pakistani-origin people had blackmailed and raped girls in several areas of England. Musk said that Sunak was a public prosecutor at that time but failed to punish the culprits. Now, he should be punished. Initially, Musk called this gang the Asian grooming gang. Priyanka Chaturvedi, a Shiv Sena MP, opened his eyes. On Musk's social platform X, it was written - do not call it Asian, call it Pakistani. Musk realized his mistake and wrote - yes. Now, imagine the relationship between Musk and Pakistan in this situation. Pakistan will face the consequences. With a population of 240 million, Pakistan banned Twitter (now X) in February 2024, before the elections. Musk bought this social media platform for $44 billion in 2022. The government banned it due to objectionable content not being removed. A year later, the platform is still banned in Pakistan, although there are less than 50 lakh users in the country. China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Myanmar, Venezuela, and Turkmenistan are the only countries that have banned X. Now, Starlink is testing the Pakistan-Musk relationship. As soon as Musk agreed with Priyanka Chaturvedi, Pakistani MPs got angry, saying that Musk should apologize for his comments about the country before granting a license to Starlink.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:39 PM\nSource:[News18 India](https://hindi.news18.com/news/world/pakistan-pakistan-upset-over-elon-musk-comments-starlink-license-stalled-ws-d-9064405.html)\n\n**X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey: rights watchdog**\nX, formerly known as Twitter, blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts include those belonging to Turkish journalists, activists, and media organizations operated by journalists living in exile, as well as some that have been inactive since 2015. This is not the first time X has complied with the Turkish government's censorship demands, having previously blocked access to over 100 accounts in October 2024. The move has been criticized by human rights and media freedom groups, who say it amounts to censorship. Turkey has a poor track record of online freedoms, with a score of 31 in a 100-point index, making it the lowest-scoring country in Europe. The Turkish government has been accused of muzzling freedom of expression and cracking down on people who express criticism of their government on social media.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 02:47 PM\nSource:[stockholmcf.org](https://stockholmcf.org/x-blocked-access-to-126-accounts-in-turkey-rights-watchdog/)\n\n**Roskomnadzor: No Grounds for Unblocking Social Media Platform X**\nThe Russian Communications Oversight Agency (Roskomnadzor) stated that there are no grounds for lifting the ban on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). According to TASS, a spokesperson for the agency said, 'There are no grounds for unblocking.' This contradicts the opinion of Ekaterina Mizulina, head of the 'League of Safe Internet', who believes that there are grounds for unblocking the platform. She stated that X has significantly reduced the amount of destructive content and censorship, and now provides a 'very good news background and fast information dissemination'. Mizulina suggested that the government should consider lifting the restrictions on X, which was blocked in Russia in March 2022 for not removing prohibited content. She emphasized that the final decision should be based on data from regulators. Earlier, Sergey Boyarsky, head of the Committee on Information Policy in the State Duma, said that there are currently no signs of X aligning with the Russian legal framework.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/politics/54161106-rkn-ne-uvidel-predposylok-dlya-razblokirovki-sotsseti-h/)\n\n**Mizulina Agrees to Unblocking Twitter**\nEkateryna Mizulina, head of the 'League of Safe Internet', believes that there are grounds for lifting the ban on social media platform X (Twitter) in Russia. According to her, the platform has significantly reduced 'destructive content and censorship of information'. Mizulina thinks that the government should consider removing the restrictive measures currently in place against the platform. She added that the final decision should be based on data from regulators. Mizulina noted that X already provides a 'very good news background and fast information dissemination'. The social media platform X was blocked in Russia in March 2022 for not removing prohibited content. Mizulina also expects the full return of social media platform TikTok to Russia, saying that it is 'underestimated by the state as a platform for working with youth and promoting the history of Russia, its culture, and the beauty of the country.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:16 AM\nSource:[gazeta.ru](https://www.gazeta.ru/tech/news/2025/02/06/25015496.shtml)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters unanimously identified that, as of late May 2025, Wikipedia listed China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela as 'currently' blocking X (formerly Twitter). The primary driver of uncertainty is recent, credible news (NetBlocks, TechRadar, and others) confirming that Pakistan restored access to X in May 2025 after a 15-month ban. All other listed countries show no signs of unblocking, with entrenched legal, technical, and political mechanisms in place to maintain their bans.\n\nThe central forecasting hinge is whether Wikipedia editors, by July 1, 2025, will have: (A) updated the 'currently blocking' list to reflect Pakistan's restoration of X access, or (B) lagged in updating, disputed the durability of the change, or missed it, leaving the list unchanged. Most experts note that Wikipedia is typically responsive to major, well-sourced censorship changes, especially those validated by reputable outlets and technical evidence, though there is a risk of editorial delay, disputes, or uncertainty causing inertia.\n\nFor all countries except Pakistan, forecasters assign extremely low likelihoods of sudden unblocking before July 2025. The scenario for a 'No' resolution (not all countries remain on the list) is almost exclusively contingent upon Wikipedia reflecting the Pakistan update; scenarios for a 'Yes' ('all 8 still listed') depend on editorial lag or ambiguity.\n\nProbabilities assigned to a 'Yes' outcome (all countries still listed) ranged from 8% to 65%, with a clear majority of forecasters (and most final probabilities) below 50%, reflecting the strong likelihood that Pakistan will be removed from the Wikipedia list by resolution time. Only one expert, focused on structural inertia, gave a majority-positive probability for 'Yes' (65%). Most experts, across digital rights, policy, and area studies perspectives, assign a 10-40% chance for 'Yes,' with several forecasting even lower odds, based on Wikipedia's typical update patterns for high-profile, well-corroborated delistings.\n\nIn summary, expert consensus is that\u2014barring a rapid reversal in Pakistan or unusual Wikipedia update lag\u2014Wikipedia will most likely remove Pakistan from the 'currently blocking' list by July 1, 2025, resulting in a 'No' resolution (i.e., not all countries still listed as blocking X). There remains, however, a non-trivial chance that editorial delays, disputes, or uncertainty could maintain the full list and trigger a 'Yes' resolution, but this is considered a minority scenario."
