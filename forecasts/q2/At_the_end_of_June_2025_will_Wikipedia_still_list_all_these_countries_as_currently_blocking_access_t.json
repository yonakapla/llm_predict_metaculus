Given this, and in pursuit of maximal scoring under contest rules, I will edge upward by 1 point to reflect an even stronger consensus and the ultra-low base rate for change within the interval.

Both the ceiling forecasters (99%) and my 98% case share the same empirical stance, but there is a case for adjusting marginally upward given the total lack of contravening developments, Wikipedia's ultra-conservative editorial process, and the vanishingly small probability of edit war, sudden documented unblock, or regime-driven delisting in less than four weeks. The discussion making a distinction between 97-99% also shows that while a black swan risk theoretically exists, the practical chance is so small as to be almost negligible.

On review, my initial probability (97) arguably errs on the side of epistemic caution, but is defensible as a baseline for outlier, last-minute outcomes.

The measure, signed by President Donald Trump, establishes a total ban on entry for citizens from 12 nations, while seven others will face partial restrictions. The countries with a total block on entry to the US are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Partial restrictions will apply to citizens of Venezuela, Cuba, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Turkmenistan. According to the official document published by the White House, the decision is based on the lack of adequate verification and background investigation mechanisms in the affected countries, which poses a potential risk to national security, facilitating the entry of illegal immigrants and potential terrorist threats. President Trump defended the measure, stating, 'We cannot allow open migration from countries where we cannot verify the identity and background of those who wish to enter. That's why we're imposing new restrictions on nations like Yemen, Somalia, Haiti, Libya, and others.' The order also details that the restrictions apply to both migrants and non-migrants. The president instructed the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to identify countries with deficient verification systems. After conducting the analysis, several countries were found to have significant flaws that justify their inclusion in the list of migration restrictions. However, the executive order signed by President Trump includes a series of exceptions to avoid affecting individuals who meet specific conditions, such as those with permanent residence in the US or dual citizenship, who can enter without issues if they travel with the passport of the unaffected country. The order also allows the entry of citizens with certain visas, such as diplomatic ones, and individuals participating in international sports events, including athletes, coaches, support staff, and close family members. In these cases, approval will depend on a Department of State evaluation. Another group excluded from the restrictions are asylum seekers, refugees, and individuals in similar situations protected by international human rights regulations. Finally, the document clarifies that the order will not imply the revocation of existing visas, meaning that those who already have approved permits will not be affected by the measure.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 01:12 AM\nSource:[Diario La Rep\u00fablica](https://www.larepublica.co/globoeconomia/se-dio-a-conocer-una-lista-de-paises-que-tendran-prohibicion-para-entrar-a-ee-uu-4149591)\n\n**Tanzania Blocks X Over Explicit Content**\nTanzania has blocked access to X due to explicit sexual content, including homosexual pornography, which the platform has allowed since last year.

LHRC finds it 'concerning' that government officials are still active on X despite the government ban. Other platforms like Telegram and Clubhouse are only accessible via VPNs. The block on X follows political tensions in the country, including the arrest of opposition leader Tundu Lissu and the expulsion of foreign activists, such as Kenyan Martha Karua. President Samia Suluhu Hassan denies the allegations, but her government is under fire for increasing repression. Amnesty International and other organizations call for an independent investigation. 'It is zorgwekkend that government officials are still active on X despite the government ban,' said LHRC.

Experts argue that DNS resolvers are 'neutral infrastructure - not censorship tools,' and that these measures are often ineffective and lead to overblocking, fragmentation, and harm to the open internet. The report highlights cases of internet blocking in Europe, Russia, and other countries, and urges the global community to document these incidents and push back against these measures. As Christian Dawson, Executive Director of the i2Coalition, said, 'This report is a wake-up call. DNS resolvers are not censorship tools.

The move comes after a wave of high-profile account hacks, including a police account and the YouTube account of the country's tax authority. Tanzania's Minister of Information, Jerry Silaa, stated that X's decision to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content 'contradicts our regulations'. Silaa emphasized that the government is working to protect consumers by monitoring content on other online platforms deemed to be in breach of the country's laws. He said, 'If you notice in any social media, not necessarily X, that you search for content on YouTube or other networks and it's unavailable, then know that the government is working to protect consumers.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 03:03 PM\nSource:[news24](https://www.news24.com/world/africa/contrary-to-our-laws-tanzania-blocks-x-over-pornographic-content-20250604-0902)\n\n**Kyrgyzstan Deputies Approve Bill to Ban Pornographic Websites**\nDeputies of the Jogorku Kenesh discussed a bill 'On the prohibition of access to websites containing pornographic content in the internet space'. The bill's initiators, including Marlen Mamatayev, Dinaara Ashimova, Talant Mamytov, and others, aim to ban the spread of pornographic content in the Kyrgyz Republic. According to the bill, 'the dissemination of content containing elements of pornographic character in the internet space of the Kyrgyz Republic is not allowed'. The bill proposes to restrict access to a website or page with pornographic content within 24 hours of receiving a request, and the website owner must remove such content within 24 hours of being notified by the authorized state body. If the owner refuses to remove the content or fails to comply with the deadline, the website may be suspended for up to two months. The bill also proposes creating a register of banned internet sites containing pornographic content, which will be blocked throughout the territory of the KR. Deputy Dastan Bekeshov questioned the need for a new law, citing the existing law on harmful content for children, which was passed last year. 'Is this law not enough? We have already banned child pornography, but for adults, maybe we can allow it with some passwords? In Japan, they watch it and develop. Let him sit at home and relax. You prohibit it, and he will go out to find it,' Bekeshov said. In response to Bekeshov's questions, Deputy Minister of Culture, Information, and Youth Policy Marat Tagaev noted that the previous law is working and two television channels have been fined for spreading harmful information to children. 'This law regulates television channels and online platforms that have registered in Kyrgyzstan. We control sites that have passed official registration. But in this bill, it's about those who have not passed registration,' Tagaev said. He added that internet service providers have the technical ability to completely block porn sites, but there is no way to bypass VPN systems. The deputies passed the bill in the first reading.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 11:46 AM\nSource:[24.kg](https://24.kg/obschestvo/331587_deputatyi_vpervom_chtenii_odobrili_zakonoproekt_ozaprete_pornosaytov/)\n\n**Donald Trump Imposes Full Travel Ban on 12 Countries**\nPresident Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a full travel ban on citizens from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Additionally, citizens from seven countries, including Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela, will face heightened restrictions. According to Trump, the order is necessary to protect the national security and national interest of the United States. He stated, 'We will not let what happened in Europe happen to America,' and emphasized the need to block migration from countries where U.S. authorities cannot 'safely and reliably vet and screen' applicants. Trump also claimed that 'millions and millions of these illegals should not be in our country,' and asserted that the U.S. will not allow people to enter who wish to do harm.

This measure will block the entry of citizens from 12 nations into the United States. The affected countries are: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The ban will take effect at 00:01 hours on Monday. Additionally, the government will impose stricter restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Trump stated, 'I will act to protect the national security and the national interest of the United States and its people.' This decision is based on a report requested on January 20 on 'hostile attitudes' towards the US and the evaluation of the risk posed by certain countries. Trump previously implemented an executive order in January 2017 that denied entry to US citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. This ban was known as the 'Muslim ban' and caused significant chaos and confusion, with travelers detained at US airports. The policy also included a ban on entry for Venezuelan government officials and North Korean citizens. Trump's goal, according to the president, was to ensure national security and prevent security risks. The announcement of this new ban has raised concerns among human rights organizations and community groups, who argue that these restrictions are discriminatory and do not reflect the true spirit of welcome that characterizes the United States. Trump and his supporters defend the restrictions, citing security concerns, and insisting that they are not based on anti-Muslim prejudice. However, this narrative faces criticism from various sectors.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 12:59 AM\nSource:[Cadena 3 Argentina](https://www.cadena3.com/noticia/mundo/trump-reinstaura-veto-a-viajeros-de-12-paises-a-partir-del-proximo-lunes_429513)\n\n**Tanzania Blocks X Over Explicit Content**\nTanzania has blocked access to X due to explicit sexual content, including homosexual pornography, which the platform has allowed since last year.

The report highlights cases of internet blocking in Europe, Russia, and other countries, and urges the global community to document these incidents and push back against these measures. As Christian Dawson, Executive Director of the i2Coalition, said, 'This report is a wake-up call. DNS resolvers are not censorship tools.

The move comes after a wave of high-profile account hacks, including a police account and the YouTube account of the country's tax authority. Tanzania's Minister of Information, Jerry Silaa, stated that X's decision to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content 'contradicts our regulations'. Silaa emphasized that the government is working to protect consumers by monitoring content on other online platforms deemed to be in breach of the country's laws. He said, 'If you notice in any social media, not necessarily X, that you search for content on YouTube or other networks and it's unavailable, then know that the government is working to protect consumers.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 03:03 PM\nSource:[news24](https://www.news24.com/world/africa/contrary-to-our-laws-tanzania-blocks-x-over-pornographic-content-20250604-0902)\n\n**Kyrgyzstan Deputies Approve Bill to Ban Pornographic Websites**\nDeputies of the Jogorku Kenesh discussed a bill 'On the prohibition of access to websites containing pornographic content in the internet space'. The bill's initiators, including Marlen Mamatayev, Dinaara Ashimova, Talant Mamytov, and others, aim to ban the spread of pornographic content in the Kyrgyz Republic. According to the bill, 'the dissemination of content containing elements of pornographic character in the internet space of the Kyrgyz Republic is not allowed'. The bill proposes to restrict access to a website or page with pornographic content within 24 hours of receiving a request, and the website owner must remove such content within 24 hours of being notified by the authorized state body. If the owner refuses to remove the content or fails to comply with the deadline, the website may be suspended for up to two months. The bill also proposes creating a register of banned internet sites containing pornographic content, which will be blocked throughout the territory of the KR. Deputy Dastan Bekeshov questioned the need for a new law, citing the existing law on harmful content for children, which was passed last year. 'Is this law not enough? We have already banned child pornography, but for adults, maybe we can allow it with some passwords? In Japan, they watch it and develop. Let him sit at home and relax. You prohibit it, and he will go out to find it,' Bekeshov said. In response to Bekeshov's questions, Deputy Minister of Culture, Information, and Youth Policy Marat Tagaev noted that the previous law is working and two television channels have been fined for spreading harmful information to children. 'This law regulates television channels and online platforms that have registered in Kyrgyzstan. We control sites that have passed official registration. But in this bill, it's about those who have not passed registration,' Tagaev said. He added that internet service providers have the technical ability to completely block porn sites, but there is no way to bypass VPN systems. The deputies passed the bill in the first reading.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 11:46 AM\nSource:[24.kg](https://24.kg/obschestvo/331587_deputatyi_vpervom_chtenii_odobrili_zakonoproekt_ozaprete_pornosaytov/)\n\n**DeepSeek AI Application Censors Tiananmen Square Anniversary**\nOn the 36th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, users on the social media platform X asked the Chinese AI application DeepSeek 'what day is today?' but received the response 'I'm unable to answer this question, let's change the topic.' Users then asked the same question yesterday and received the answer 'June 3rd, Tuesday.' When asked 'what day will it be tomorrow?' the response was the same. Users criticized DeepSeek, saying 'it's no better than a elementary school student,' and 'it's just a standard answer given by the internet censors.' According to a report by the Liberty Times, a journalist tested DeepSeek and received the same response. In contrast, ChatGPT answered 'June 4th is a sensitive day in China.' A user on X previously stated that DeepSeek is 'a censored version of ChatGPT.' After the incident, DeepSeek appeared to have been 'fixed.' A US report revealed that DeepSeek shares user data with the Chinese government and has a significant interest in the Chinese Communist Party. DeepSeek has been banned by the US Department of Defense, NASA, the US House of Representatives, the Texas government, and the Taiwanese government. Apple and Google have also removed DeepSeek from their app stores in Italy. Several countries, including the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and India, are reviewing the risks associated with DeepSeek.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/6/4/n14524231.htm)\n\n**7 Countries with Internet Censorship: North Korea, China, and More**\nSeven countries have been identified as having significant internet censorship: China, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Russia.

Iran has introduced stricter regulations, including the criminalization of using VPNs without a government-issued permit. Iraq has been blocking social media and news outlets during times of crisis, while Myanmar has imposed full internet shutdowns since the military coup in 2021.

The key opposition figure has been accused of involvement in terrorism, bribery, and fraud, which he denies. His supporters believe that the government is trying to prevent him from participating in the elections. Many people involved in the protests have found that their X accounts have been blocked, including activists who shared information about the protests and locations where people could gather. According to Yusuf Kan, coordinator and analyst of the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center, many of these accounts had tens of thousands of followers. Activist Omer Faruk Aslan created a second account to avoid censorship, saying, 'My account was blocked by court order because the number of tweet views exceeded 6 million.' Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya stated that the authorities found 326 social media accounts that 'incited hatred,' 72 of which were allegedly located abroad. 54 people were arrested for allegedly being connected to these accounts. From a local law perspective, suspending accounts is not a violation, as local rules allow such actions at the government's request. The 2022 Social Media Law provides the government with broad and vague powers to suppress content. Social media platforms like X essentially have no choice: either comply with the request or face a complete block in the country. This is not the first time X has restricted access to content in Turkey. For example, a large portion of content was blocked in 2023 when President Erdogan was running for re-election and won. According to transparency reports, in the second half of 2024, X fulfilled around 86% of the Turkish government's requests to remove content, compared to 68% in the first half of the year. Although the removal rate is lower than in the European Union, where it reached 90% in the second half of 2024, Turkish authorities submit around six times more requests to remove content per capita.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 24, 2025 08:37 AM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/tech/ru/x-ilona-maska-blokiruet-oppoziciju-v-turcii-vo-vremja-protestov-tehno_n2782758)\n\n**X Challenges Indian Government's Censorship Powers**\nElon Musk's social media platform X has filed a case against the Indian government for using control orders to remove social media content. India is one of the top five countries in the world for the number of government requests to remove social media content, according to a report. This is the latest challenge to the Indian government's censorship powers by X, which has recently entered the world's fifth-largest economy with its Starlink and Tesla. The government has used a major legal provision to issue orders to block the case, which X alleges is being misused to create parallel surveillance systems that ignore existing security measures. 'According to X, this provision... is being misused to create parallel surveillance systems that are being used to block information,' reported Bar & Bench, a Indian legal news website. The case will be heard by a court in the southern state of Karnataka on March 27. Musk's social media platform is not new to legal battles in India. In 2023, the Indian court rejected an appeal by X to challenge an order to remove tweets and accounts criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and imposed a fine of $61,000 on the platform. Almost a year later, X said it was challenging an order to block 'specific accounts and posts' by the government. 'We have a written appeal challenging the blocking orders of the Indian government. We have also informed affected users of these actions in accordance with our policies,' the company said in February 2024. 'We believe that publishing these orders is necessary for transparency, but we are unable to publish them due to legal restrictions, which can lead to a lack of accountability and arbitrary decision-making.'\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: March 21, 2025 01:54 PM\nSource:[Online Khabar](https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2025/03/1646297/social-network-x-files-lawsuit-against-indian-government)\n\n**X Files Lawsuit Against India Over Alleged Illegal Content Blocking**\nX, a platform owned by Elon Musk, has filed a lawsuit against the Indian government, accusing it of illegally blocking and removing content from the platform. According to the lawsuit, the Indian government created an 'electronic censorship portal' last year, allowing government agencies, state authorities, and thousands of police officers to issue collective orders to remove content from the platform, violating the Indian Constitution and the Information Technology Act. The lawsuit claims that this will lead to widespread censorship and illegal blocking of lawful information on the X platform, harming X and affecting its business. The Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has declined to comment. The lawsuit was filed in the Supreme Court of Karnataka, in southern India, where X, formerly known as Twitter, lost a similar case in 2023. This unexpected lawsuit comes at a sensitive time for both Elon Musk, who is seeking to open up new economic avenues in India, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is facing increasing pressure from the Trump administration on trade and immigration, according to the Washington Post. 'This is no longer a simple matter of interpreting a specific legal provision, but a broader geo-political issue,' said Shashank Reddy, a partner at Evarde Law and Policy, a specialist in technology law. India has tightened its grip on online freedom of expression during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure, and has faced little resistance but active cooperation from American social media companies.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 10:12 PM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u062a\u0648](https://www.vetogate.com/5372996)\n\n**X takes legal action against India's IT ministry over content blocking practices**\nX (formerly Twitter) has taken legal action against India's IT Ministry over its expanded censorship powers, which allow for easier online content removal. The lawsuit alleges that the Ministry has directed other government departments to use a government website to issue content-blocking orders, undermining existing legal safeguards and facilitating unchecked censorship. The case marks an escalation in the legal dispute between X and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over online content removal. As X's lawyer said, 'The new mechanism seeks to annul the directive and facilitate unchecked censorship.' The case is set to resume on March 27.

The company claims that government authorities are misusing this section to bypass the safeguards of Section 69A and arbitrarily censor online content. X wants the court to stop the government from acting against the company for orders that do not comply with Section 69A and to protect the company from onboarding an employee on the Sahyog portal, which X calls a 'Censorship Portal'. The company argues that multiple Union ministries have issued notifications designating nodal officers under Section 79(3)(b) to demand content removals, which are unconstitutional and must be quashed. X also claims that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is unlawfully facilitating this parallel system. The company is seeking to prevent the government's misuse of Section 79(3)(b) and create a censorship system without checks and balances.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/x-approaches-hc-over-centre-using-it-act-to-block-content-101742412191170.html)\n\n**Venezuela's Digital Censorship: A Growing Concern**\nVenezuela has shown 'alarming' numbers of digital censorship, according to Ve Sin Filtro, a program that monitors and documents threats to human rights in the digital environment. Between January 2016 and January 2025, the program recorded 1,335 events of deliberate and selective blocking of websites by the government, with 949 of these events still active, preventing citizens from accessing 134 websites, 60 of which are independent media outlets. 'Practically all independent news media on the internet are blocked in Venezuela, and that makes it impossible for Venezuelans to inform themselves,' said Andr\u00e9s Azp\u00farua, director of Ve Sin Filtro. 'These blockages are severe restrictions on human rights, especially the right to freedom of expression and access to information,' he added. Ve Sin Filtro also denounces the persecution of citizens who express their ideas on digital platforms, which is a critical example of the reduction and censorship of the digital civic space. The program is particularly concerned about the blocking of platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Wikipedia, Signal, public DNS servers, and VPN websites, which are used to evade censorship on the internet. 'Only in January 2025, 32 public DNS servers were blocked, mainly by the state-owned CANTV, intermittently. This prevents users who used these servers to evade DNS blocks from navigating the internet and leaving them practically disconnected, increasing censorship,' the report states. Azp\u00farua recommends using Psiphon, TunnelBear, and ProtonVPN, which offer free plans for Venezuela, and the Noticias Sin Filtro application, which allows access to news from a group of blocked portals without the need for a VPN.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:46 PM\nSource:[stereo100.com.gt](https://stereo100.com.gt/2025/venezuela-muestra-cifras-alarmantes-de-censura-digital-denuncia-ve-sin-filtro/)\n\n**The value of X**\nPakistan continues to block social media platform X (formerly Twitter), despite mounting legal and public pressure. The Lahore High Court is currently hearing petitions challenging the ban, which argue that restricting access to X violates Articles 19 and 19-A of the constitution, guaranteeing freedom of expression and access to information. The court has questioned why government institutions and officials, including the prime minister, continue to use X despite its official prohibition. The ban was imposed in early 2024 under the caretaker government, but its justification, citing confidential reports from intelligence agencies, is unconvincing and reeks of political expediency. The government's actions suggest an intent to normalise digital censorship under the guise of security, which is unacceptable. Free speech and access to information are fundamental to democracy, and an open digital space is crucial for political discourse. The ban on X should not become the new normal, and the government should engage in democratic debate, address misinformation through transparency, and strengthen public trust. Censorship is not the solution; dialogue and accountability are.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[thenews.com.pk](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1292447-the-value-of-x)\n\n**Trump Administration Considers Restricting Entry of Citizens from 43 Countries**\nThe Trump administration is considering restricting the entry of citizens from 43 countries, including North Korea, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, according to a report by The New York Times.

The report reveals that 134 websites remain inaccessible in the country, with 60 belonging to media outlets. Additionally, 228 domains have been blocked, a practice that hinders citizens' ability to freely inform and communicate in the digital environment. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Wikipedia, and the encrypted messaging app Signal have been restricted, along with public DNS servers and VPN websites. In January 2025, 98 blockages were recorded against 32 IP addresses belonging to server companies, leaving many users without access. VE sin Filtro warns that these blockages not only affect freedom of expression but also undermine the right to access information in a context of political and social crisis.

Pakistan had already banned X (formerly Twitter) before. In January, when internet speed in Pakistan slowed down, some people tagged Elon Musk on Twitter, asking him to provide Starlink service. Musk replied that Starlink was waiting for approval from the Pakistani government. Since then, the world has changed. At least in global politics, Elon Musk has become a central figure. After becoming the Department of Government Efficiency (DoGE) head in Donald Trump's team, Musk targeted England, calling for the removal of PM Rishi Sunak. Behind this was Pakistan. Musk had raised the issue of sexual assault of girls 15 years ago. At that time, Pakistani-origin people had blackmailed and raped girls in several areas of England. Musk said that Sunak was a public prosecutor at that time but failed to punish the culprits. Now, he should be punished. Initially, Musk called this gang the Asian grooming gang. Priyanka Chaturvedi, a Shiv Sena MP, opened his eyes. On Musk's social platform X, it was written - do not call it Asian, call it Pakistani. Musk realized his mistake and wrote - yes. Now, imagine the relationship between Musk and Pakistan in this situation. Pakistan will face the consequences. With a population of 240 million, Pakistan banned Twitter (now X) in February 2024, before the elections. Musk bought this social media platform for $44 billion in 2022. The government banned it due to objectionable content not being removed. A year later, the platform is still banned in Pakistan, although there are less than 50 lakh users in the country. China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Myanmar, Venezuela, and Turkmenistan are the only countries that have banned X. Now, Starlink is testing the Pakistan-Musk relationship. As soon as Musk agreed with Priyanka Chaturvedi, Pakistani MPs got angry, saying that Musk should apologize for his comments about the country before granting a license to Starlink.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:39 PM\nSource:[News18 India](https://hindi.news18.com/news/world/pakistan-pakistan-upset-over-elon-musk-comments-starlink-license-stalled-ws-d-9064405.html)\n\n**X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey: rights watchdog**\nX, formerly known as Twitter, blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.'

    "summary": "All eight experts strongly agree that it is extremely likely Wikipedia will continue to list all seven countries\u2014China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela\u2014as 'currently' blocking X (formerly Twitter) at the end of June 2025. Their consensus rests on several key points: (1) the entrenchment and resilience of digital censorship policies in these authoritarian or highly illiberal regimes, which almost never reverse such blocks without major regime change or external shock; (2) the absence of any credible news or reporting suggesting imminent or even potential shifts towards liberalization in any of these countries, with several countries (notably Venezuela, China, and Russia) instead showing intensified censorship efforts in recent months; (3) Wikipedia's editorial caution and reliance on multiple credible sources before changing blocked-status listings, leading to a conservative lag in updating the status of any country; and (4) the statistically negligible base rate for a sudden, documented unblock across even one, let alone all, of these countries within the coming weeks. The only factors slightly decreasing probability are the very low but nonzero risk of abrupt regime policy changes or Wikipedia consensus/edit war disruptions, but these are considered extremely unlikely to result in delisting by the July 1, 2025 resolution date. All experts assign very high probabilities (ranging from 97% to 99%) to a Yes outcome, concluding that the Wikipedia page will almost certainly still list all seven specified countries as blocking X when Metaculus checks for resolution."
