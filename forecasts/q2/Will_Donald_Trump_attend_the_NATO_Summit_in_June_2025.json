The base rate for a U.S. president not attending such a summit when officially confirmed is extremely low (below 1% historically in peacetime and outside of acute personal crises or U.S. emergencies). Trump's preference to use such meetings as leverage, his political stake in pressuring allies, and the Alliance's own agenda suggest the event has been structured (even in terms of Ukraine's role) to maximize his comfort and reduce summit risks.

There is no current evidence of emergent risk; the operational machinery and reputational costs of a no-show all but eliminate the rationale for discounting below 98%. The only scenarios that would prevent attendance are true black swan shocks, for which there is no signal at present.

Multiple other forecasters, especially those focusing on protocol and transatlantic engagement, independently converge on near-identical probabilities for Trump's attendance, emphasizing (like I did) the near-impossibility of a last-minute reversal at this late stage. Critiques from more theoretical or rational-choice perspectives sometimes overstate the risk of black swan events or personal erraticism, but without any actual evidence of disruption, these are best viewed as epistemic caution, not substantive threat. The sheer weight of protocol, planning, and institutional lock-in\u2014combined with the strategic incentives for Trump to attend\u2014overwhelmingly favor a 'Yes' outcome.

According to Levitt, 'I can confirm that he will attend the summit.' Trump's participation highlights the importance of the event for the United States and its future course within the North Atlantic Alliance. Trump has repeatedly emphasized the need for NATO member countries to increase their military spending, calling for them to allocate 5% of their GDP to defense. For many countries, this would mean a significant increase in their defense budgets compared to current levels. The summit in The Hague will discuss establishing a target level of spending, with 3.5% of GDP to be allocated to core defense needs and an additional 1.5% to related areas, such as infrastructure, cybersecurity, and civil preparedness. This new approach aims to enhance collective security and adapt the Alliance to modern challenges. Additionally, NATO is considering including Ukraine's new military aid in the 5% defense spending target.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: June 04, 2025 07:28 AM\nSource:[bigmir)net](https://news.bigmir.net/ua/world/10092080-donald-tramp-pidtverdiv-uchast-u-samiti-nato-v-gaazi)\n\n**Trump to Attend NATO Summit in the Netherlands**\nU.S. President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague, the Netherlands, on June 24-25, according to the White House. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt made the announcement, stating that Ukraine has been invited to the summit. Trump has been a skeptic of NATO and has called for other members to increase their defense spending. In contrast, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is considering attending the summit, which would be his fourth consecutive year as sitting Japanese leader. NATO has been strengthening ties with its Indo-Pacific partners, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, in response to security challenges from nondemocratic countries like China, North Korea, and Russia. 'Ukraine has been invited to the two-day summit of the military alliance of countries from Europe and North America,' Leavitt said. 'It will be the fourth straight year the sitting Japanese leader has done so,' if Ishiba attends.

It was previously reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would not be invited to the main discussions of the summit, allegedly to accommodate Trump. However, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied these claims, stating that several NATO member countries had already raised the issue of inviting Zelensky to the summit, and the US had no objections.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 03:18 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/world/geopolitics/tramp-podtverdil-uchastie-v-iyunskom-sammite-nato-v-gaage-50516250.html)\n\n**Trump Confirms Attendance at NATO Summit in The Hague**\nUS President Donald Trump has confirmed his attendance at the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, in a phone call with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Rutte said, 'It is a great honor for the Netherlands to welcome President Trump and all other NATO allies.' Trump's attendance was earlier uncertain, as he seemed to tie his support for NATO to the level of defense investment by other member states. The Netherlands will host the NATO summit on June 24-25 at the World Forum in The Hague. However, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans expects that NATO leaders will not reach an agreement on the pace of increasing defense budgets, but will instead set a deadline for achieving the goal. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte wants the 32 member states to allocate 3.5% of their GDP to defense and an additional 1.5% to related areas. Brekelmans noted that the timing and pace of achieving this goal will be crucial.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: May 22, 2025 08:42 PM\nSource:[Het Laatste Nieuws](https://www.hln.be/buitenland/trump-bevestigt-komst-naar-navo-top-in-den-haag-poetin-wil-bufferzone-in-russische-grensregio-die-onder-vuur-ligt-van-oekraine~a2c6d779/)\n\n**US Opposes Zelensky's Attendance at NATO Summit**\nThe NATO summit will be held in The Hague, Netherlands from June 24 to 25. According to ANSA, the US is opposed to inviting Ukrainian President Zelensky to the summit, and most allies are puzzled by Washington's decision. Currently, only Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand have received invitations as non-member countries. To avoid a confrontation with US President Trump, the summit agenda will be narrower than usual, with a dinner hosted by the Dutch royal family on June 24 and a meeting to discuss increasing defense spending on June 25. There are no plans for a NATO-Ukraine leader-level meeting, but the final decision has not been made. According to reports, Kiev can attend some meetings on June 24-25, but only at the level of foreign and defense ministers. Zelensky attended the first 'NATO-Ukraine Council' leader-level meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2023 and again in 2024. ANSA reported that the invitation to Ukraine may be raised at the informal foreign ministers' meeting in Antalya. A Dutch national broadcaster source said that the decision to ban Zelensky from attending the summit may still be subject to change. Trump has repeatedly ruled out Ukraine's accession to NATO, saying 'I don't think they'll ever be able to join NATO. I've thought that from the very beginning. The reason for the war is that they started talking about joining NATO. If they hadn't brought it up, the war might not have started at all.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 15, 2025 08:31 AM\nSource:[guancha.cn](https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2025_05_15_775942.shtml)\n\n**Trump to Attend NATO Summit, Demands 5% Defense Spending from Member Countries**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced that he will attend the upcoming NATO summit in June, despite earlier reports that he was considering skipping the meeting. The summit will take place in The Hague, Netherlands, and will focus on increasing defense spending among NATO member countries. Trump has called for NATO member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, up from the current 2% target. This has been met with resistance from some European countries, who are struggling to meet the current target. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has suggested that the new target could be implemented over a period of 7 years, starting from 2025. The US Ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, has stated that the 5% target is not just a number, but a necessity for the alliance's security. The summit will be a crucial test of NATO's unity and commitment to its member countries. The outcome of the summit will have significant implications for the alliance's future and the security of its member countries.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: May 14, 2025 04:31 PM\nSource:[DR](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/udland/analyse-trump-har-lovet-usa-vil-blive-i-nato-nu-vil-han-teste-om-europa-rent-faktisk)\n\n**Rubio To Attend NATO Meeting In Turkey**\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will attend an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Turkey on May 14-16 to discuss ending Russia's war against Ukraine.

The summit will take place in The Hague, Netherlands. According to Sikorski, Trump has assured NATO leaders that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty remains in effect. Article 5 states that an attack on one NATO member is considered an attack on all, and each country is obligated to provide assistance, including military aid. Sikorski noted that this principle of collective defense has only been applied once, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US. 'It's good that the new US administration is realizing that allies are an asset, not a burden,' Sikorski said. 'I reminded them of this in my speech when the Alliance first and, thank God, lastly applied Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, and it was to the benefit of the United States. Ultimately, we, Poland, had no national interests in Afghanistan. We did it out of friendship and alliance solidarity with the US,' he added.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: April 04, 2025 09:44 PM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/politics-news/5-ta-stattya-aktualna-j-nadali-stalo-vidomo-scho-tramp-planue-vidvidati-chervnevij-samit-nato.htm)\n\n**Polish Foreign Minister: Trump Committed to NATO's Article 5, Will Attend Summit in The Hague**\nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated on Friday that US President Donald Trump is still committed to upholding NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause and will attend the NATO summit in The Hague in June. NATO's Article 5 is one of the alliance's core principles, stating that an attack on any member state will be considered an attack on all member states. However, Trump's security policies previously raised concerns among Europeans about whether the US would fulfill this commitment. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed at the NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on Thursday that the US remains committed to NATO, while also emphasizing that member countries must significantly increase their defense spending. According to Reuters, when Sikorski was asked if he believed the US was still committed to defending NATO territory, he replied, 'Yes. President Trump has confirmed this to other leaders, and this commitment remains in effect, and as far as we know, President Trump will attend the summit in The Hague.' The Trump administration is pushing for NATO member countries to increase their military spending to 5% of their GDP, far exceeding the current 2% target. Although 23 member countries have reached or exceeded 2% last year, countries such as Belgium, Italy, and Spain still have not met the target. The 2025 NATO summit will be held from June 24 to 26 at the World Forum in The Hague, which is also the first time the Netherlands will host a NATO summit.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: April 04, 2025 02:07 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/4/4/n14474792.htm)\n\n**Trump Reaffirms Commitment to NATO's Article 5, to Attend Summit in The Hague**\nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated on Friday that US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his commitment to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which guarantees collective defense, and will attend the NATO summit in The Hague in June.

    "summary": "All eight experts forecast a very high probability that Donald Trump will attend the NATO Summit in June 2025 in person, with individual probability estimates clustered tightly between 97% and 98%. The consensus is firmly grounded in multiple, recent, and official confirmations from the White House and corroborating sources across allied governments and the international press that Trump\u2019s attendance is planned and logistically prepared. \n\nExperts from diverse perspectives\u2014including US presidential protocol, NATO participation patterns, European diplomatic norms, political science theoretical frameworks, international relations, and US executive decision making\u2014all emphasize the extremely strong historical base rate: sitting US presidents almost never skip major NATO summits after official confirmation, barring extraordinary sudden events such as serious health issues, major domestic emergencies, or severe international crises. \n\nWhile all forecasters acknowledge a residual tail risk due to Trump\u2019s historical unpredictability, personal diplomatic style, age, or the potential for unanticipated emergencies (health, legal, security, or acute domestic crises), none cite any current signals of such disruptions. Even Trump\u2019s characteristic brinkmanship and use of ambiguity is generally assessed to heighten rather than lessen his incentive to attend, given the opportunity to leverage the summit for his agenda (especially around defense spending). The only plausible 'No' scenarios involve true black-swan events absent from present reporting.\n\nTherefore, the expert consensus is that, with less than three weeks until the summit and all systems pointed toward attendance, the outcome will almost certainly be Yes."
