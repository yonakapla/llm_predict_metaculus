There is no history of AU acceptance of a surprise ratification from a regime lacking both domestic legitimacy and basic administrative operation. 'Peer pressure' and 'technical prep' are nearly meaningless without a single, recognized, and stable authority.

Sudan's state decay isn't an abstract governance problem\u2014it's active institutional paralysis, and the base rate for treaty progress in such settings is nil. The only way ratification happens is if a desperate faction tries a symbolic act for AU legitimacy, and, as you note, these cases are vanishingly rare and easily ignored or rejected by the AU.

The concession of a faint 'sliver' for a last-minute move is the right touch of humility, but you anchor your estimate squarely in reality.

Your call that 'no credible evidence of imminent ratification' matters more than technocratic drift speaks directly to rational incentives\u2014no regime on life support voluntarily spends energy on non-urgent international trade deals.

The comparative examples of Libya, Somalia, and South Sudan are absolutely relevant: the fantasy of a last-minute, war-torn government making elite, legitimate treaty acts in weeks is shattered by historical evidence.

Sudan\u2019s elites\u2014divided, threatened, and preoccupied with existential concerns\u2014face neither the functional state capacity nor the incentive to expend political or diplomatic capital on a move that brings no security, cash, or recognition from international heavyweights. Historically, the AU does not rubber-stamp high-level treaty deposits from governments lacking clear legitimacy and minimal institutional functionality. You substantially overweigh peer pressure, technical progress, and alleged marginal upsides, while turning a blind eye to the legal and practical black hole left by state collapse.

The inaugural AfCFTA Digital Trade and Services Forum, hosted by Zambia, brought together leaders to discuss digital trade integration and implementation of the AfCFTA Protocol on Digital Trade. President Hakainde Hichilema of Zambia called for stronger collaboration between governments and the private sector to ensure inclusive growth through digital trade, while Wamkele Mene, AfCFTA Secretariat, stressed the urgency of collective action in building digital infrastructure and scaling up innovation. The forum outlined key priorities, including strengthening digital infrastructure, promoting digital skills development, and adopting harmonised regulations that prioritize inclusivity and security. Stakeholders were urged to ensure that digital trade becomes a driver of equitable economic growth across the continent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 06, 2025 04:52 AM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/news/africa-to-deepen-digital-trade-integration-under-afcfta/)\n\n**Africa Is Not Aspiring to Join Arbitration - It's Already a Key Player - Experts**\nExperts at a conference in Kigali on June 5 declared that Africa is not aspiring to join the arbitration world, but rather is already a key player. Chief Justice Domitilla Mukantaganzwa emphasized that arbitration is no longer a foreign concept on the continent, citing Rwanda's progress in embedding arbitration as a vital part of its justice system. She noted that African countries are revising arbitration laws, modernizing legal frameworks, and strengthening institutions to support effective dispute resolution. Mukantaganzwa called for continued investment in developing local talent, strengthening institutions, and building trust. International arbitration expert Meg Kinnear highlighted the importance of arbitration for its speed, confidentiality, and flexibility, but stressed the need for enforceability. The Minister of Justice, Emmanuel Ugirashebuja, commended Africa's growing leadership in arbitration, stating that it is key to building trust in trade, resolving disputes fairly, and advancing sustainable development. 'Arbitration is key to building trust in trade, resolving disputes fairly, and advancing sustainable development,' he said. 'With mechanisms like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) taking shape, cross-border transactions will increase and arbitration will be essential.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 05, 2025 03:42 PM\nSource:[allafrica.com](https://allafrica.com/stories/202506050477.html)\n\n**Future of business in Africa will be shaped by partnerships**\nThe future of business in Africa will be shaped by partnerships, according to the Corporate and Investment Banking Managing Principal at Absa Bank Kenya Plc. As global and regional forces continue to evolve, businesses are navigating an economic environment characterized by currency movements, changing capital flows, and shifts in trade dynamics. This has led to a shift in corporate and institutional clients' operating models, with a focus on greater financial agility, liquidity management, and adaptive funding strategies.

The sector is dominated by cement and building materials, food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals and fertilisers, wood, and textiles. However, intra-African trade has remained relatively low. Recent data suggests a promising shift, with a 195% year-on-year surge in intra-African trade to N2.911 trillion in the second quarter of 2024. Companies such as Dangote Cement and BUA Group are actively involved in exporting manufactured goods to neighbouring African states. To scale up impacts, Nigeria must utilise its network of Free Trade Zones (FTZs) and provide a tangible solution to its power sector. Regulatory hurdles also slow down cross-border transactions, and the Nigerian government must set and harmonise trade policies to reduce customs delays and streamline documentation processes. Trade fairs and expos offer platforms for Nigerian manufacturers to build networks and secure buyers. As a leading economic engine room in Africa, the trade agreement through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offers Nigeria a strategic opportunity to diversify its economy, strengthen local industries, and drive sustainable development.

A dynamic marketplace requires credit risk management as a fundamental discipline. Anticipating and mitigating risks is crucial for secure and profitable export ventures. A holistic view, clear contracts, and robust force majeure clauses are essential. An informed approach to credit management involves rigorous buyer due diligence, country risk assessment, and trade credit insurance.

Despite progress, full implementation faces hurdles. Wamkele Mene, Secretary General of the AfCFTA, says the recent 'perfect storm' of supply chain collapse, the Russia-Ukraine war, and increased global trade and investment protectionism has created an urgent need for continental self-sufficiency. Tony Elumelu emphasizes the critical importance of swiftly implementing the AfCFTA, saying it must translate into 'tangible progress' for Africa's economic growth. The pact is projected to boost Africa's income by $450 billion by 2035 and increase Africa's exports by $560 billion, mostly in manufacturing.

With 54 African countries having signed the agreement and 48 having ratified, experts are calling for aggressive implementation and operationalization of the agreement. Aly-Khan Satchu, founder of Rich Management, said African countries should encourage internal African-generated impulses like AfCFTA for growth, rather than relying on external impulses like the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). According to the World Economic Forum, Africa should shift gears and look inward with pride, deepen cross-border collaboration, and build the continent with bold intent. James Shikwati, director of Inter Region Economic Network, said African countries should accelerate efforts in addressing obstacles that hinder full implementation of the AfCFTA, including agreement on goods that should be traded within Africa and putting in place an effective industrialization strategy to ensure Africa adds value to its products. Shikwati said Africa is the future market, with a projected population of close to 4 billion by 2100, and the AfCFTA is well positioned as a platform for that expected future market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 02, 2025 01:03 AM\nSource:[global.chinadaily.com.cn](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202505/02/WS681417eca310a04af22bd3d2.html)\n\n**Nigeria ratifies 90% duty waiver on imports under AfCFTA to crash costs**\nThe Nigerian government has ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, which will eliminate 90% of import duties within Africa.

Launched in 2021, the agreement aims to transform Africa's economic landscape by eliminating tariffs on 90% of goods and reducing non-tariff barriers. According to the World Bank, full implementation of AfCFTA could boost intra-African trade by 45% by 2035 and increase Africa's exports to global markets by 32%. The agreement simplifies customs procedures and reduces cross-border transaction costs, enabling small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to expand their reach beyond national borders. AfCFTA also emphasizes digital trade and e-commerce, creating new avenues for SMEs to participate in the global economy. By leveraging digital platforms, African entrepreneurs can tap into regional markets while bypassing traditional barriers imposed by Western economies. The agreement has the potential to drive inclusive growth across sectors, with high-value sectors like agribusiness and manufacturing standing to benefit significantly from increased intra-African trade. However, AfCFTA faces several hurdles that must be addressed to unlock its full potential, including inadequate infrastructure and effective implementation of non-restrictive rules of origin. Policymakers must also ensure that excluded products are minimized to maximize market access across sectors.

While the treaty's architects have finished their work and most African nations have signed on, the implementation is being carried out on local levels. Governments are not businesses and should enable trade opportunities by providing infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and electricity. Malawi and Mozambique have agreed to establish one-stop border posts, and the World Bank is financing road infrastructure improvements in both countries. Bilateral projects are also meeting energy needs, such as the South Sudan-Sudan energy pipeline and the Eastern Electricity Highway Project. The AfCFTA is being realised through individual nations coming together to meet trade needs, with projects such as the Lobito Corridor Railway project and the African Atlantic Gas Pipeline. These projects aim to boost energy security, provide new jobs, and distribute fuel to millions of customers, as envisioned by the AfCFTA architects.

The report states that the AfCFTA Agreement can help boost trade-led growth, unlock regional value chains, and ensure that Africa transitions from being a supplier of raw materials to a producer of high-value goods and services. The report also notes that Africa can benefit from the new global trade landscape, characterized by fragmentation, regionalism, and near-shoring, as it incentivizes the continent to pursue deeper regional integration. The report projects that Africa's growth will gradually recover to 3.8% this year and 4.1% in 2026 on the back of increased private consumption and improved trade performance. However, while growth has rebounded post-pandemic, it remains subdued and is still below the level needed to improve people's living standards and reach the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The report proposes that Africa needs to reinforce the ongoing trend and look for its own, Africa-grown solutions for its development challenges. The AfCFTA Agreement can help address the continent's key challenges like energy gaps and food insecurity by fostering cross-border trade in energy products and encouraging African countries to adopt renewable-energy technologies. The report also notes that implementing climate policies could boost Africa's renewable energy use by 5% to 12% by 2045. The AfCFTA can also tackle food insecurity by enhancing food market integration and boosting intra-African food trade, helping reduce the impact of climatic events on production and prices. According to the report, a successful AfCFTA, driven by industrialisation and diversification, could significantly boost Africa's trade and drive transformational change. It could shift Africa from primary commodity exports to higher-value industrial products, while raising intra-African trade by almost half. The report also notes that the AfCFTA Agreement positions Africa to strengthen trade ties with rapidly growing emerging markets like China, India, and T\u00fcrkiye, thereby strengthening its resilience against global shocks. The report highlights that successful implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement over the medium term could also contribute to global trade and growth, thereby enhancing Africa's competitiveness and its position as a global growth pole. If accompanied by supportive policies fostering trade and investment, the AfCFTA can build livelihoods and social cohesion, thus contributing to the integrated, peaceful, and prosperous Africa envisaged in the African Union 'Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want'. The report also notes that the full implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement by 2045 is expected to raise Africa's GDP by 1.2% and welfare by 0.9%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 26, 2025 04:21 AM\nSource:[polity.org.za](https://www.polity.org.za/article/afcfta-is-key-to-africas-economic-resilience-un-eca-report-2025-03-25)\n\n**Accelerating the Implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area to Dynamize Africa's Development**\nAfrica is at a 'decisive moment in its development trajectory' due to the COVID-19 pandemic, high debt, and unfavorable global economic and geopolitical context.

According to the 'Economic Report on Africa 2025', Africa's economic growth is expected to reach 3.8% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026. The growth is expected to pick up pace due to increased private consumption and improved trade performance. However, the report notes that this growth 'remains moderate and far below what Africa could achieve and what is needed to improve the standard of living of populations and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)'. A combination of internal and external political and economic factors, as well as climate shocks, hinder the continent's ability to achieve the SDGs and take off economically.

The report emphasizes the importance of fully implementing the agreement, including reducing tariffs and eliminating non-tariff barriers, unifying trade policies among African countries, and developing regional value chains in strategic sectors such as food, automotive, pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy. The report also recommends simplifying customs procedures through the use of digital technologies such as the electronic single window (blockchain) and electronic data processing to reduce trade costs and improve efficiency, promoting women's participation through policies that support their access to finance, education, and digital skills, and investing in sustainable urban development to provide a supportive environment for economic growth. The report notes that Africa is at a 'critical juncture' in its development path, particularly in light of the failure to restore pre-COVID-19 levels, making the implementation of the AfCFTA agreement, which was signed in 2018 and began in 2021, a 'roadmap for achieving comprehensive and sustainable growth.' The report predicts that the agreement will increase intra-African trade by 45% by 2045, with a 1.2% increase in the continent's GDP, promoting economic integration and development. The report also emphasizes the need for investments worth $120.83 billion in the transportation sector by 2030 to support infrastructure, in addition to simplifying regulatory frameworks to promote access to markets, and encouraging innovation and digitalization as key drivers of economic transformation. In his comment on the report, UN Deputy Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, Khaled Khiari, stated that the expectations indicate a decrease in the debt-to-GDP ratio in Africa from 36.7% in 2023 to 16.2% in 2025, but considered this improvement 'insufficient' to achieve sustainable development goals. Khiari stressed that Africa has a 'unique opportunity' to re-shape its economic path through the implementation of the AfCFTA agreement, which will enhance the transition from a raw material supplier to a producer of goods and services with added value, and support the building of a more competitive and innovative economy.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 07:01 PM\nSource:[Alg\u00e9rie Presse Service](https://www.aps.dz/ar/economie/177230-2025)\n\n**Stakeholders push for review of Africa's major trade pact**\nAfrican leaders, traders, and stakeholders have called for a review of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to assess its effectiveness and make adjustments.

The AfCFTA has the potential to boost intra-African trade by over 52.3% by 2035, but success hinges on financial independence and a strategic break from foreign currency dependency. The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) is a major breakthrough in this regard, enabling real-time transactions in local currencies and eliminating the need for USD or Euro conversions. However, achieving its full potential requires regulatory harmonization, cross-border adoption, and unwavering political support.

Despite being launched in 2019 and commencing trading in 2021, implementation has been sluggish. According to Africa Kiiza, a trade policy analyst, the agreement's foundation was built on an overly simplistic assumption that tariff removal and trade liberalization alone would automatically lead to increased trade. Kiiza argues that production-related challenges, such as low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers, must be addressed before trade can flourish. As of 2025, 54 out of 55 African Union member countries have signed the agreement, but full execution remains distant, with the goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods pushed back to 2034. Kiiza stresses that these hurdles challenge the production capacity of the continent and must be addressed before trade can flourish, reinforcing his point that tariff removal alone is insufficient. 'The idea that liberalization and tariff removal will automatically increase trade is flawed. We must first overcome production-related challenges to truly facilitate exchanges,' he explains.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 09:30 PM\nSource:[modernghana.com](https://www.modernghana.com/news/1378568/five-years-on-afcfta-struggles-to-deliver-on.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All expert forecasters agree that Sudan is extremely unlikely to ratify the AfCFTA (African Continental Free Trade Area) before July 1, 2025. Their forecasts cluster tightly at very low probabilities\u2014ranging from 2% to 15%, with most estimates between 2% and 7%. The central reasons driving this consensus are Sudan\u2019s ongoing civil conflict, state fragmentation, and the lack of a functioning or unified government capable of executing formal international treaty ratification. While several experts briefly note recent technical progress (such as the validation of a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy), they view this as insufficient without stable legislative or executive authority. The base rate from similar African states in crisis further supports a very low probability, as ratification under such conditions typically occurs only after substantial stabilization\u2014often with considerable delay. Regional and African Union peer pressure, economic incentives, and symbolic legitimacy are cited as modest countervailing factors, but they do not outweigh the dominant institutional and political barriers. All experts concur that absent a highly improbable, rapid domestic breakthrough\u2014such as a consolidated transitional government or effective international intervention\u2014the scenario for timely ratification is extremely remote. There are no news reports or indications suggesting imminent parliamentary or executive action in Sudan toward this aim. Hence, the collective expert judgment predicts a nearly certain 'No' outcome for Sudan ratifying AfCFTA before the deadline."
