The new cycle of reciprocal criticism between Erdo\u011fan and S\u00e1nchez is unlikely to shift the needle for either among their domestic audiences. The most likely outcome is stability in public sentiment, with both remaining at low approval levels. Recent public news does not indicate a new positive shock for Erdo\u011fan. If anything, S\u00e1nchez's pro-Palestinian advocacy is more notable, which may offer a small short-term bump with his base, but overall Spain remains divided and approval gains are capped. In Turkey, Erdo\u011fan is secure among his base but faces persistent dissatisfaction among urban voters and a stagnant economy. Since both leaders have approval in roughly the same range with high volatility and a history of swapping positions in the approval league tables with small margin swings, I estimate a slightly better than even chance that Sanchez will be ahead in July: this reflects (a) the absence of a coming Erdo\u011fan 'rally' event, (b) the possibility of a small rally for S\u00e1nchez on Gaza diplomacy, but (c) high uncertainty and nearly even base rates.",

Recent international conflicts (Gaza, EU sanctions) and their political handling will likely polarize rather than substantially lift S\u00e1nchez\u2019s position in Spain, while Erdo\u011fan\u2019s bid for a new constitution risks further eroding his approval among undecideds, but his core remains loyal. Given 1 month to go, the most likely outcome is another close contest, with Erdo\u011fan a slight favorite to maintain or edge out S\u00e1nchez on approval due to the proven resilience of his base and the current lack of positive triggers for S\u00e1nchez. However, a last-minute Spanish rally\u2014if international leadership yields a positive domestic media narrative\u2014cannot be entirely discounted.

International gambits around Gaza are marginal for true swing sentiment; if anything, these simply galvanize right opposition. Meanwhile, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s approval benefits from the institutional and structural insulation of a hybrid regime and a media system that ensures no catastrophic collapse. The 20% probability is perhaps even generous given historical ranges, but captures the essential point: nothing in the 2025 headlines or the last 24 months of Spanish or Turkish polling justifies a contrarian call. The lack of a decisive trend or shock maintains the historic approval gap, and AreaStudiesIberianStudies gets that right."

Multiple forecasters with comparative political, area studies, and polling expertise highlight the persistent, modest gap generally favoring Erdo\u011fan in Morning Consult\u2019s historical series, and remind that Spain's intense polarization and modest appetite for foreign policy grandstanding rarely result in significant short-term approval bumps. The absence of imminent, high-impact events, combined with structurally resilient (if low) support for Erdo\u011fan, probabilistically suggests the status quo (or a narrow Erdo\u011fan lead) as the most likely outcome.

The statistical tendency of Turkish polling (higher floor, slower movement), combined with Spain's highly fragmented, negative-sum political environment and weak historical precedent for rapid surges in S\u00e1nchez's approval, make a S\u00e1nchez-over-Erdo\u011fan outcome very unlikely without a major game-changing event\u2014which neither news nor trends suggest is imminent. Moreover, the critiques of sociological optimism and the warnings about IR 'handwaving' reinforce that this question should be approached by hard base rates, not narrative possibilities or sudden international bounce scenarios for S\u00e1nchez.

No contrary analysis provided convincing evidence of either (a) a coming event that could flip this standing, or (b) a meaningful recent polling signal of S\u00e1nchez overtaking Erdo\u011fan. Even more bullish estimates of S\u00e1nchez's odds rely on volatility that historical data doesn't actually support; repeated debate over Gaza and constitutional issues is simply not translating to the kind of seismic shifts required.

S\u00e1nchez will push for stronger EU action against Israel's military offensive in Gaza, which has resulted in over 53,000 Palestinian deaths, including more than 15,000 children, since October 2023. Spain is calling for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement and individual sanctions against those obstructing a two-state solution in the Middle East, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The EU has already agreed to review its association agreement with Israel at the request of 17 countries, including Spain, to assess whether Israel is meeting its human rights obligations. Von der Leyen has delayed the imposition of a 50% tariff on EU products, which was set to take effect on June 1, and has given the US until July 9 to reach an agreement on tariffs. Meanwhile, Trump continues to escalate his trade war with China.

Erdogan, who has been in power since 2014 and served as prime minister for over a decade before that, defended the need for a new constitution, saying that the current one, which was drafted after a 1980 military coup, is outdated and still retains elements of military influence despite several amendments. Erdogan said in a speech to local officials from his ruling party: 'I appointed 10 legal experts to start working on it as of yesterday, and we will continue, through this effort, to prepare for a new constitution. For 23 years, we have shown our genuine intention to crown our democracy with a new, civilian, and liberal constitution.' Erdogan denied that the new constitution is aimed at allowing him to remain in power, saying last week: 'We want the new constitution for our country, not for ourselves.' In 2017, the Turkish parliament approved constitutional amendments proposed by Erdogan's ruling party, which introduced a presidential system of government, giving the president powers to issue decrees, appoint ministers, and more. The amendments were approved in a national referendum the same year.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 08:12 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_publicaffairs/details/2025/5/27/2794807/%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%81-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D9%87)\n\n**Erdo\u011fan Criticizes Spanish PM for 'Free \u0130mamo\u011flu' Sign**\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan criticized Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez for holding a 'Free \u0130mamo\u011flu' sign during a meeting of the Socialist International.

The two leaders will also discuss a new summit between the two countries, which will be hosted by Turkey after the last summit was held in Madrid in June last year. S\u00e1nchez and Erdogan will focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Gaza, with S\u00e1nchez announcing that Spain will propose a resolution to the UN to have the International Court of Justice rule on Israel's compliance with its obligations regarding access to humanitarian aid in Gaza. The two leaders will also discuss the situation in Ukraine, where negotiations between Russia and Ukraine were held in Turkey last week, resulting in the exchange of 1,000 prisoners and the sharing of written conditions for a potential ceasefire. S\u00e1nchez will also attend a meeting of the Socialist International, which he presides over, on Saturday.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 05:42 AM\nSource:[El Dia](https://www.eldia.es/nacional/2025/05/23/sanchez-reune-hoy-turquia-erdogan-117731022.html)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez to Meet with Erdogan in Turkey to Discuss Gaza Situation**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday in Turkey to discuss the situation in Gaza, among other issues. According to Moncloa, the meeting will focus on 'bilateral issues of mutual interest, as well as regional and international issues of current relevance', with Gaza being a key point. S\u00e1nchez has been actively working on the Gaza issue, participating in a meeting with European leaders last week to call for an end to Israel's blockade of Gaza, which has prevented humanitarian aid from entering the Palestinian enclave for over two months. Spain is also working with Palestine on a resolution to be voted on in the UN General Assembly to demand immediate and unrestricted access to humanitarian aid. S\u00e1nchez will likely discuss this proposal with Erdogan, which aims to improve the situation in Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the immediate resumption of humanitarian aid to Gaza, allowing a basic amount of food to enter the territory to prevent a hunger crisis. 'We will allow the entry of a basic amount of food to avoid a hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip that would put at risk the continuation of the operation to defeat Hamas,' Netanyahu's office said. S\u00e1nchez's meeting with Erdogan comes as Spain continues to push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 'It is a great day,' said S\u00e1nchez, 'and we will continue to work towards a solution that benefits both parties.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 08:52 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-sanchez-reunira-viernes-erdogan-turquia-gaza-temas-principales-tratar-20250519105258.html)\n\n**Global Leaders with Highest Approval Ratings in 2025**\nAccording to a survey conducted by Morning Consult between January 21 and 27, 2025, the leaders with the highest approval ratings are Narendra Modi of India, with 75% approval, and Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, with 66%.

    "summary": "Across eight expert forecasts, the consensus is that it is somewhat unlikely Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez will have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on July 1, 2025, per Morning Consult. Forecasters consistently emphasize that both leaders are unpopular in their respective countries and highly polarized environments, with recent approval data generally placing Erdo\u011fan slightly ahead of S\u00e1nchez by several points, reflecting long-term base rate patterns. Most experts cite structural factors boosting Erdo\u011fan\u2019s relative rating: Turkey\u2019s more centralized/media-controlled political system favors incumbents in approval surveys, and Erdo\u011fan\u2019s solid nationalist base typically holds his rating in the mid-30s to low-40s, whereas S\u00e1nchez\u2019s approval in Spain is usually lower due to multiparty fragmentation, coalition fatigue, and deep polarization.\n\nShort-term volatility is limited with only about a month to go, and there are no anticipated major events expected to sharply shift approval ratings in either country prior to the resolution date. S\u00e1nchez's recent international activism (notably on Palestine/Gaza) may energize his base but is unlikely to deliver a decisive approval bump given domestic divides and economic anxieties; Erdo\u011fan, meanwhile, is simultaneously buttressed by core supporters but weighed down by persistent economic woes and controversies over constitutional reform. While several scenarios are posited in which S\u00e1nchez could overtake Erdo\u011fan\u2014such as a sharp domestic crisis in Turkey or a significant rally-around-the-flag moment in Spain\u2014these are viewed as unlikely given current trends and the absence of disruptive news.\n\nMost forecasts cluster final probabilities for S\u00e1nchez being ahead between 20% and 40%. Two experts (PoliticalPollingPublicOpinionMeasurement and SociologySocialIdentityTheory) assign slightly higher chances (57%), but both qualify this with strong uncertainty and note that any S\u00e1nchez lead would likely be narrow and subject to volatility and/or polling noise. Ultimately, experts judge continuation of the status quo as most probable: Erdo\u011fan maintains a marginal but real lead in approval over S\u00e1nchez in the Morning Consult reading checked after July 1, 2025."
