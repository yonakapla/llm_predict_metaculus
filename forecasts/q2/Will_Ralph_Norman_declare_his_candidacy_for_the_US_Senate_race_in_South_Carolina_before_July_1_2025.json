No news article or Republican party rumor since late 2023 has tied Norman to a Senate race, which is highly significant given the high level of scrutiny on the state\u2019s political maneuvering. The only plausible 'yes' scenario involves an entirely unpredictable and extreme external shock before July 1. Given this combined with relevant base rates (very few substantial, credible politicians abruptly switch tracks from an anticipated governor launch to a Senate challenge against a well-entrenched incumbent on very short notice), the likelihood Norman will declare a Senate candidacy by July 1, 2025, is extremely low.",

Kemp cited family reasons, while Sununu said it wasn't right for him and his family. Some Republicans point to these decisions as signs that the party is having trouble recruiting centrist candidates who can appeal to voters statewide. However, others argue that Kemp's decision was not a surprise and that the party is still in a strong position to win the seat. Rep. Buddy Carter, a 'MAGA Warrior,' has announced his candidacy, while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a firebrand conservative, has decided not to run. The NRSC has indicated it will consider getting involved in Senate primaries on a case-by-case basis.

In Kentucky, multiple Republicans are now publicly or privately expressing interest in running to succeed Mitch McConnell, whom almost everyone anticipates will retire next year after stepping down as leader of the Senate GOP and suffering a series of health issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[bluedelaware.com](https://bluedelaware.com/2025/02/14/the-political-report-february-14-2025/)\n\n**SC politicians eye governors seat; who might be running**\nSouth Carolina politicians are already eyeing the governor's seat in 2026, as Henry McMaster will be term-limited. Gibbs Knotts, provost at Coastal Carolina University, expects a competitive field with several potential candidates, including Attorney General Alan Wilson, Lt. Governor Pamela Evette, US Rep Ralph Norman, and US Rep Nancy Mace. Mace has already criticized her potential opponents, while Evette and Wilson are still considering a run. Knotts predicts that national issues such as DEI policies and immigration enforcement will be major topics during the primary. Wilson has outlined his plans for immigration enforcement, which focus on giving law enforcement more bandwidth to work with federal officials to keep borders safe. Evette is considering running and has discussed her focus on efficiency and automation in state agencies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 10:12 PM\nSource:[wjbf.com](https://www.wjbf.com/news/south-carolina-news/sc-politicians-eye-governors-seat-who-might-be-running/)\n\n**Greenville businessman announces bid to unseat Sen. Lindsey Graham**\nMark Lynch, a Greenville businessman and owner of Jeff Lynch Appliance Center, has announced his candidacy to run against incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham in the 2026 election. Lynch, a Republican, has called Graham a 'RINO' (Republican In Name Only) and accused him of 'betraying Republicans in South Carolina.' Lynch described himself as a 'God-fearing, conservative businessman' who will 'fight alongside President Trump against the powers of evil.' Graham, who has been representing South Carolina in the U.S. Senate since 2003, is running for his fifth term. His campaign has announced that Sen. Tim Scott and Gov.

Lynch, who is also an addiction counselor, an avid marksman, and a deacon at his church, criticized Graham for his past actions, stating that he 'kept his mouth shut' while Republicans pushed the 'Russia Hoax' against Donald Trump, and that he 'refused to fully fund the border wall' when Republicans controlled Congress. Lynch described himself as a 'God-fearing, conservative businessman' who will 'fight alongside President Trump against the powers of evil,' and stated that it's 'time to send Lindsey Graham home.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 08:18 PM\nSource:[wistv.com](https://www.wistv.com/2025/02/05/sc-businessman-mark-lynch-announces-plans-run-against-sen-lindsey-graham/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a wide spectrum of expert perspectives\u2014including political science, sociology, journalism, electoral consulting, and Southern US studies\u2014all forecasters assign an extremely low probability that Ralph Norman will declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. The consensus reasoning is grounded in several factors: \n\n1) Ralph Norman has consistently signaled, and has been publicly reported as, being focused on exploring a gubernatorial campaign in 2026, rather than a Senate run. His own statements, as well as all recent media coverage, cite gubernatorial\u2014not Senate\u2014ambitions. \n2) The primary challenger lane to incumbent Lindsey Graham (who has Trump, Governor McMaster, and Senator Tim Scott's endorsements) has already been filled by Mark Lynch, reducing the strategic rationale and opportunity for Norman to enter the race. Multi-way primary challenges against a well-endorsed incumbent are both rare and inefficient, particularly for politicians with alternative ambitions and safe seats. \n3) There are no visible signals, such as campaign infrastructure, staff hiring, fundraising, media trial balloons, or leaks, suggesting Norman is moving toward a Senate run. The window for a credible announcement is closing fast, and late major-candidate entries by sitting House members with no prior groundwork are exceedingly rare in the political base rate.\n4) All expert scenarios involving a 'Yes' outcome require a substantial, unpredictable shock\u2014such as a collapse or sudden withdrawal of current candidates, a major scandal, or unprecedented intra-party upheaval\u2014none of which have even marginally materialized in recent news or insider chatter.\n5) The structural and institutional factors, as well as opportunity cost logic, all point clearly toward Norman prioritizing either the gubernatorial race or retaining his influential House seat.\n\nWhile some experts allow for a minimal, non-zero probability due to inherent unpredictability in politics, the median probability across forecasters is 2-3%, with all placing the outcome squarely in the 'very unlikely' category barring a major and rapid unforeseen change. The summary judgment is that Ralph Norman remains focused elsewhere, and will not declare for the US Senate by July 1, 2025."
