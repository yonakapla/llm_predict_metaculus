Both Canadian domestic actors (the influential Sikh community) and Indian domestic political calculations (electoral and security concerns) strongly disincentivize Modi\u2019s participation absent a major, unexpected diplomatic breakthrough. Furthermore, in the G7\u2019s historical record, guest invitations to major summits are never issued so late, particularly for a high-profile guest such as India. Host country discretion, the lack of urgency from core G7 partners to override Canada's veto, and the absence of formal Indian outreach all support a base rate close to zero. Structural incentives for keeping India engaged (balancing China, aligning toward the Global South) matter, but they are clearly second-order in this specific instance.

Indian MEA's silence is notable and contrasts with past enthusiasm. Canadian domestic and diaspora politics (especially Sikh/India tensions) play a direct role this year and sharply constrain Mark Carney's (the new Canadian PM) political bandwidth for inviting Modi. The only mild countervailing factor is abstract G7 interest in India remaining within its guest orbit, but this is vastly outweighed by bilateral animosity and security/logistical impediments. With less than two weeks to summit, a last-minute reversal appears extremely improbable. Political Science institutionalism further suggests that procedural/institutional rules\u2014while flexible\u2014are usually followed unless higher systemic risks argue against; in this case, following the norm of inviting India could itself risk institutional legitimacy, given host-country domestic controversy.\n\nThus, the likelihood of Modi attending the 2025 G7 summit in person is extremely low, comfortably within the range where a forecast of near-zero is justified by the protocol, institutional, and diplomatic context.",

PoliticalScienceInstitutionalism and other leading forecasters appropriately highlight that the confluence of protocol finality, logistical impossibility, lack of invitation, and overwhelming domestic pressure in Canada foreclose any plausible Yes scenario. Appeals to historical Indian attendance at the G7 become irrelevant in the face of the present, acute bilateral breakdown. Even those who mention the potential for a last-minute invitation converge on the conclusion that such an unlikely reversal lacks both precedent and practical feasibility. No new evidence or argument emerged in Phase 2 to suggest any upside risk.

The only minor counterargument\u2014residual G7 interest in India and precedent of high base-rate attendance\u2014is now clearly immaterial given immediate circumstances.

The mechanistic barriers (no invitation, no logistical runway, explicit finalization of other guest slots) are by this point absolute rather than contingent, and the inertia of protocol and political cost is even greater than initially stated. There is unanimous, strong agreement that any remaining probability is now tail risk bordering on the notional.

There is consistency across expert perspectives\u2014ranging from summit diplomacy protocol, institutional analysis, to regional expertise\u2014with unanimous consensus clustering at 1-3%. In fact, institutional and regional specialists persuasively argue that historic base rates or leadership calculus are essentially moot here; host-country discretion, bilateral crisis, and timing shut the door completely. As such, the objectively justified forecast is not only very low, but if anything, could be pushed even further toward zero. However, to maintain modest credence for literal tail risks such as a diplomatic miracle (with zero supporting evidence), I will slightly reduce my forecast from 2% to 1%.",

For example, the institutional and protocol arguments are so overwhelming that holding even a 3% probability begins to look too charitable. There is universal agreement that the absence of an invitation this close to the summit, coupled with entrenched host-country political constraints, makes a last-minute reversal practically impossible.

No new evidence or argument from any perspective suggested even a sliver of realistic possibility for a last-minute reversal.

The consensus is overwhelming that logistical, protocol, host-country domestic, and bilateral diplomatic barriers now preclude any realistic last-minute reversal.

However, according to reports from Today's India, the Indian government has not received an invitation from the Canadian government. This suggests that Modi may be absent from the G7 summit for the first time in 6 years, indicating that he is no longer a favorite of the West. The Canadian government has sent formal invitations to Australia, Ukraine, and South Africa, but not to India, which was once a rising star. This omission suggests that Canada and other G7 member countries no longer consider India a priority. The Canadian government invited Ukraine to coordinate their stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while Australia is a core member of the G7 and a key ally of the West. South Africa was invited as the host of the G20 summit this year, and the G7 must pay special attention to the host country to ensure a smooth transition and coordination. India has not hosted or participated in any major international conference in 2025, which may have led to its exclusion from the G7 summit. As Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, 'We are committed to working with our international partners to address the challenges facing our world.' However, it seems that India is no longer a priority for the West.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 08:15 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20250603/48417471.html)\n\n**Narendra Modi's Potential Absence from G7 Summit Due to Strained India-Canada Relations**\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not attend the G7 summit in Canada in June due to strained relations between India and Canada.

The report cites a source as saying that the relationship between Canada and India needs to be improved before high-level visits like the G7 summit can take place. The source also mentions that even if Modi plans to visit Canada in the future, there are security concerns that need to be addressed. India has been invited to participate in the G7 summit since 2019, and it has been seen as a way for India to expand its global influence. However, the relationship between Canada and India has been strained since 2023, when Canadian Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar was killed in Vancouver. Canada accused India of planning the attack, leading to a diplomatic row between the two countries. 'We have no information about Prime Minister Modi attending the G7 summit,' the Indian Foreign Ministry said twice last month. South Africa, Ukraine, and Australia have already accepted Canada's invitation to attend the summit. 'We have a very important relationship with India,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said when he first took office. However, he also acknowledged that the relationship has been strained due to 'non-Canadian reasons' and that the two countries need to resolve their issues on a basis of mutual respect. Canada has a large Indian diaspora community, with around 1.8 million people of Indian origin, making up nearly 5% of the country's population. The Indian government has previously protested against Canada's alleged support for Sikh separatist movements, which it sees as a threat to its sovereignty.

This is due to the fact that Canada has not extended an invitation to Modi, and also because of the strained relations between the two countries over the assassination of Sikh leader Nijjar. Although a new government led by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken office, the relationship between India and Canada remains tense and awkward. A Canadian spokesperson refused to confirm whether Modi had received an invitation to the summit. Even if India received an invitation at the last minute, Modi would face difficulties in attending the summit due to logistical arrangements and the strained relationship between the two countries. The Sikh community in Canada has also urged Trudeau not to invite Modi, citing India's refusal to cooperate with Canada in investigating Nijjar's assassination. Modi's attendance at the G7 summit would be the first time since 2019 that an Indian leader has not attended the meeting, which is seen as a sign of India's growing global influence. In contrast, Canada has reportedly invited leaders from Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil to the summit.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 12:51 AM\nSource:[guancha.cn](https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2025_06_03_777998.shtml)\n\n**Narendra Modi May Not Attend G7 Summit Due to Diplomatic Tensions with Canada**\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be invited to the G7 summit in Canada this month, according to local newspaper The Times of India.

The sources cited security issues and the need for improved diplomatic ties, which have been strained since the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil two years ago. The Canadian government expelled six Indian diplomats last year over allegations they were involved in a plot against Sikh separatists. While uncertainty surrounds Modi's participation, reports suggest that South Africa, Ukraine, and Australia have accepted invitations to the summit.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[geo.tv](https://www.geo.tv/latest/607346-first-time-in-six-years-indias-modi-unlikely-to-attend-g7-summit-in-canada)\n\n**In a 1st in 6 years, PM Modi unlikely to be part of G7 meet, hosted by Canada | India News - Times of India**\nFor the first time in six years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unlikely to attend the G7 summit hosted by Canada from June 15-17. There has been no official invitation yet, and even if one were to be extended, India is unlikely to accept due to logistical constraints and strained bilateral ties. The decision comes amid tensions between India and Canada over the killing of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, with Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney facing pressure from Sikh separatists not to invite Modi. India has expressed hope that Carney will handle the case more responsibly than his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and is ready to work with Ottawa based on mutual trust and sensitivity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 09:04 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-6-years-pm-modi-unlikely-to-be-part-of-g7-meet-hosted-by-canada/articleshow/121556213.cms)\n\n**India's G7 Participation Remains Uncertain Amid Strained Relations with Canada**\nIndia's participation in the G7 summit, scheduled to take place in Alberta in June, remains uncertain. The Canadian government has invited several leaders, including the Mexican president, the Ukrainian president, and the Australian prime minister, but there is no confirmation on whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend. Relations between Canada and India have been strained since Ottawa accused New Delhi of being involved in the 2023 murder of a Sikh separatist leader in Vancouver. The Indian government has denied the allegations, and the two countries have expelled each other's diplomats. However, with the new Canadian government, relations seem to be warming up. Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand spoke with her Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and expressed her desire to strengthen ties between the two countries. Despite this, the Canadian Sikh community is urging Prime Minister Mark Carney not to invite Modi, citing concerns about India's human rights record and its treatment of Sikh separatists. 'Inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be a deeply irresponsible decision,' said Danish Singh, president of the World Sikh Organization of Canada, in a letter to Carney. 'It would alienate the Sikh community and signal to the world that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference and human rights violations for the sake of trade.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 06:44 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2168708/inde-sommet-g7-canada-alberta-sikh-diplomatie)\n\n**Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet | India News - Times of India**\nCanada has extended invitations to Australian Prime Minister and Ukrainian President for the upcoming G7 summit, but a decision on inviting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is still pending.

The summit is scheduled to take place in June, but Canada has not yet confirmed whether India will be invited. The relationship between India and Canada has been strained due to the Khalistan separatist movement and the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen of Indian origin. The new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has expressed a desire to rebuild relations with India, but is currently preoccupied with dealing with the Trump administration's aggressive stance. The G-7 summit will be held in Canada from June 15-17, and the guest list has not yet been finalized. India has been a regular participant in the G-7 summit since 2019, but the current situation is uncertain. 'We will provide more information at the right time,' said a Canadian official. Carney has stated that he wants to rebuild relations with India and strengthen trade ties with new partners. He also aims to build the strongest economy in the G-7. The limited space at the summit venue may also be a factor in the lack of guest leaders. Carney has remained silent on the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, which has further strained relations between India and Canada. 'We will wait and see the outcome of the next elections,' said a spokesperson for the Indian government. The RCMP has investigated the case and found that Trudeau's stance was based on the information provided by the agency. Modi and his predecessor Manmohan Singh have both been invited to the G-7 summit in the past. Modi has been a regular participant since 2019, when he was invited to Biarritz by French President Emmanuel Macron. He was also invited to the Camp David summit in 2020 by the Trump administration, but it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: March 23, 2025 04:12 AM\nSource:[Navbharat Times](https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/india/g7-summit-in-canada-pm-modi-participation-uncertain-as-canada-is-yet-to-finalise-guest-countries-list/articleshow/119364512.cms)\n\n**PM Modi presence at G7 uncertain as Canada is yet to finalise invites | India News - The Times of India**\nThe participation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the upcoming G7 summit in Canada is uncertain, as the host country has yet to finalize the guest list.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that it is extremely unlikely that India's PM Narendra Modi will attend the G7 Summit in person in June 2025. The consensus is rooted in several strong and converging factors:\n\n- There is no public record or credible news report indicating that Canada (the 2025 summit host) has extended an invitation to Modi, even as the event is less than two weeks away. This is unusual, as invitations to leaders of Modi's stature are typically sent and accepted well in advance.\n- India-Canada relations remain extremely strained following the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The subsequent diplomatic fallout includes reciprocal expulsions, suspension of consular services, and persistent public acrimony, which both sides identify as a barrier to any high-level engagement such as a G7 summit.\n- Reported domestic political pressure in Canada, particularly from the Sikh diaspora, militates strongly against an invitation and makes the political cost of including Modi especially high for Canadian leadership. This is compounded by general Canadian governmental caution and lack of diplomatic normalization.\n- Established G7 outreach patterns and summit protocol reinforce the view that last-minute invitations and participation by major leaders are extraordinarily rare, especially under conditions of acute bilateral tension.\n- All experts note that the historical base rate of Modi attending (given consistent invitations from 2019 onward) is overridden by the uniquely negative bilateral context and absence of even preliminary steps toward reconciliation.\n- The only theoretical Yes scenario is a sudden\u2014and currently unsupported\u2014diplomatic breakthrough, leading to a last-minute invitation and acceptance. All experts judge this outcome as extremely improbable given the timeline and lack of any signaling by either government.\n\nFinal probabilities assigned by the experts range from 1% to 3%, all emphasizing near-zero likelihood. The group unanimously forecasts that PM Modi will not attend the G7 Summit in June 2025."
