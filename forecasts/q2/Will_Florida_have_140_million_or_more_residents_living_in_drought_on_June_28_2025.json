However, the current drought onset is severe, and as of late May, expert commentary\u2014both from local meteorologists and drought scientists\u2014express skepticism that early June rainfall will eliminate drought for large (metro) population areas within a single month. Recent, analogous droughts in Florida (notably 2011 and 2012) typically saw major improvement by July, but not always complete erasure by late June, especially in entrenched southern and interior zones. The seasonal forecast for an extremely active hurricane season also tilts the odds toward significant, potentially rapid drought relief in June, but the exact timing is stochastic. Overall, while historical base rates and seasonal tendencies suggest a strong likelihood of going below 14 million residents in drought by June 28, the current extraordinary severity and population footprint of the drought (at its peak in late May) argue for caution on high confidence. The most plausible outcome is a decrease below 14 million, but it is not overwhelmingly certain\u2014rainfall could be less organized, or miss key population centers, preserving high numbers into late June. I therefore estimate a 70% chance of Florida having fewer than 14 million residents in drought ('No') on June 28, 2025, but assign a correspondingly non-negligible 30% chance to a 'Yes' (i.e., status remains at or above 14 million), due to the extraordinary starting conditions and potential for a lagged, uneven wet season onset.",

However, the severity and extent of the current drought, evidenced by dry Everglades, wildfires, and significant rainfall deficits (6\u201310 inches below normal since October), will likely cause lag in hydrological recovery and Drought Monitor reclassification. The forecast for an above-average Atlantic hurricane season increases the chance for sudden relief, but the exact timing and intensity of beneficial rain across densely populated drought regions are uncertain.

Water Management District history shows that droughts of this magnitude generally do not abate quickly, and the initial weeks of the wet season may not be enough for wholesale reset in state drought mapping and resident counts. Because the question resolves on or after June 28 (not simply the end of June), the chance of a dramatic drop in the drought-affected population before then is diminished but not zero\u2014there is always a possibility of an unforeseen tropical event.

Atlantic hurricane season is starting, but the model consensus is 'above-normal'; however, the chances of a June landfalling tropical cyclone alleviating drought for millions is modest, not high. Lag in Drought Monitor response + the persistence of moderate/ severe drought classified by SPI-driven indicators further argue that 4 weeks is likely not enough for a wholesale reversal.

However, the sheer severity and areal extent of drought in 2025 surpasses recent analogues (2012, 2001), introduces greater risk that improvement will be slow, especially if the wet season begins a week or two late or locally misses major cities. Given the time lag between rains and Drought Monitor updates, and the persistence in the Everglades/SW (less populous), but strong chance of meaningful improvements in populous coastal cities by June 28, the odds slightly favor a drop below the 14 million threshold, but with substantial risk (especially compared to a normal year).

However, hydrological drought lags are real, and the historical record contains several Junes where drought persists through the first month of the wet season in the absence of major rainfall events.

The persistent impact on the most populous zones and the tendency for drought metrics to remain sticky after record deficits warrant an even stronger stance.

The vast wetland ecosystem known as the Everglades, spanning over 7,800 square miles in southern Florida, is currently experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely. According to AccuWeather, the lack of rainfall has forced the suspension of airboat tours in places like Everglades Alligator Farm, located about 30 miles southwest of Miami, due to the complete absence of water. This tourist attraction, although remaining open with educational exhibits and shows, warned on Instagram that 'this drought not only affects tourism, but also puts native wildlife under stress and increases the risk of forest fires.' Mack's Fish Camp, 40 miles north, has also canceled excursions. The situation has led to wildlife concentrating in the few remaining bodies of water, resulting in overcrowding, algae proliferation, and fish mortality due to lack of oxygen, as reported by CBS News. Currently, 84% of Florida is under moderate, severe, or extreme drought conditions, a scenario not seen since April 2012, when the entire state registered similar levels. Much of the Everglades is now classified as an extreme drought zone, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. AccuWeather's climate expert, Paul Pastelok, warned that 'rainfall will be very scattered throughout the rest of May in Miami and the Everglades,' meaning that the risk of forest fires will continue to be high at least for the next month in southern Florida. Meteorologist Matt Devitt also referred to the situation on his X account, sharing new images of the wetlands: 'Update: new photos show the extreme drought in southwest Florida and the Everglades, the worst locally in 24 years.' Devitt explained that even compared to a typical dry season, the region is 6-10 inches below the average rainfall since mid-October. Although he predicted better chances of rain in the coming days, he warned that 'it is not expected to eliminate the drought.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 09:42 PM\nSource:[CiberCuba](https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-05-27-u1-e135253-s27061-nid303776-zonas-everglades-secan-peor-sequia-decada-florida)\n\n**Khabarovsk Weather and News: May 28, 2025**\nThere are no disruptions to cold water supply in Khabarovsk as of 7 am on May 28.

The plan, led by the Presidency of the Republic, proposes measures to prevent and respond to rain, floods, landslides, hurricanes, and other phenomena that could severely affect vulnerable communities nationwide. According to the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER), the winter will begin with isolated rains in May, intensifying in June. Although normal precipitation ranges are expected, the Caribbean could receive accumulations exceeding 1,000 mm. A cyclone season above the usual is also anticipated. The plan identifies vulnerability scenarios based on past events and geographical characteristics: Over 2.4 million people live in areas at risk of hurricanes, and 1.5 million in areas at risk of floods, distributed in 2,047 critical points between neighborhoods and communities. Some concrete actions include: strengthening risk communication through radio alerts, WhatsApp, and SMS messages; and periodically evaluating the condition of schools, hospitals, markets, and access roads. Public schools in Nicaragua will have trained school brigades, simulations, and infrastructure reviews. The Ministry of Health has 76 hospitals, 142 health centers, and mobile clinics to address health emergencies. ENACAL and ENATREL will execute maintenance plans for water and electricity networks. Temporary shelters with psychological accompaniment, protection of vulnerable groups, and food, water, and medicine supplies are also planned. The Nicaraguan Army will be actively involved with specialized units for search and rescue, humanitarian aid transport, and preventive evacuations. The National Police will implement road safety measures and protection in high-risk areas. Local governments will also take preventive actions: cleaning drains, pruning trees, eliminating mosquito breeding sites, and visiting homes in critical areas.

Conflict remains the primary driver of acute food insecurity, particularly in central and northern regions. The planting of 2025 cereal crops is underway in southern areas, but conflict is expected to continue to affect agricultural activities in central and northern areas, likely leading to localized production shortfalls. Average to above-average rainfall amounts are expected between June and September 2025, but also heighten the risk of flooding. The 2024 aggregate cereal production is officially estimated at 10.4 million tonnes, about 5 percent above the average of the previous five years, but flooding and civil insecurity disrupted agricultural activities, resulting in localized production shortfalls.

However, rainfall deficits in coastal areas and the departments of Borgou and Atakora have led to below-average vegetation conditions. In northern unimodal rainfall areas, planting of cereal crops has just begun and is expected to be completed by July. According to the Forum on Seasonal Forecasts, average to above-average rainfall amounts are expected between May and July, likely benefiting yields. The 2024 aggregate cereal production was estimated at 2.9 million tonnes, about 24 percent above the average of the previous five years. However, an erratic rainfall distribution and severe dry spells affected crops in localized areas. The government imposed an indefinite ban on the export of basic food commodities in May 2024, leading to a decline in maize prices. As of March 2025, about 398 000 people are estimated to face acute food insecurity, an increase from the same period in 2024. However, this apparent deterioration is mainly due to methodological issues. During the 2025 June to August lean season period, about 295 000 people are expected to face acute food insecurity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 02:59 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/benin/giews-country-brief-republic-benin-27-may-2025)\n\n**When is the 2025 hurricane season? Here's when it officially begins and ends**\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to begin on June 1 and end on November 30. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there is a 60% chance that the season will be above average, with 13-19 named tropical storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) expected to form. The NOAA attributes this forecast to warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures, ENSO-neutral conditions, low wind shear, and a more active African monsoon season. Historically, Florida is the most hurricane-prone state, with over 120 impacts since 1851. Authorities recommend anticipating and preparing for the threat, which is not limited to coastal areas, as inland flooding can also occur. 'All of these elements favor the formation of tropical cyclones,' the NOAA said in its report. The list of names for major hurricanes in 2025 includes Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and others. A low-pressure area could develop south of the Mexican coast between May 26 and 30, potentially becoming the first named storm, Alvin.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 28, 2025 10:46 AM\nSource:[MARCA](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2025/05/28/6836e827e2704ec59a8b4581.html)\n\n**Florida Faces Worst Drought in 13 Years, Everglades Dry and Wildlife at Risk**\nFlorida is facing its worst drought in 13 years, with areas of the Everglades completely dry, wildlife at risk, and tours canceled.

'We continue to believe and are convinced that we will meet the PRR. It has to be a national challenge, a challenge that requires everyone's conclusion and for us to be able to meet this goal of 26,000 homes by June 2026', he said. The minister recognized that 'the challenges are enormous', but insisted that he still 'believes', citing the work done in Alcanena as an example. 'We continue to believe that it is possible, we will manage to do it, and with examples like Alcanena, we are sure that we will do it', he emphasized. He pointed out that the causes for the delays have been identified and solutions will be found to overcome them. He also highlighted the work of the current government, which has made a 'herculean effort to increase capacity, to increase the response of the state budget [...] to be able to meet' the PRR. 'In the next few months, we will see this rhythm accelerating to conclude the 26,000 homes [by June 2026], which we have accelerated to 10,000 extra, which will also be fully funded, and therefore we believe that we can, with the help of the municipalities', he declared. The minister also confirmed that there are delays in the projects under the 1st Right - Program of Support for Access to Housing, due to empty contests, which he attributed to the 'under-budgeting' of the projects by the previous socialist executive. 'Today, construction prices continue to rise, and therefore we have some empty contests, which was already news. We are concerned about this situation, but we are monitoring and always finding solutions', he assured. In addition to the 'more than doubled' budget, the minister pointed out solutions that pass through 'different architectures of financing models' to 'be able to face these increasingly high construction prices'. The municipality of Alcanena has 318 houses planned and is 'an example' for its 'integrated vision' for the development of the municipality, allied to a global investment package of 40 million euros. 'It is an example and is leading. Precisely because it has an absolutely unique program of affordable rent and an absolutely unique 1st Right. But I would say that this vision of rehabilitating the old town, bringing in the multiplicity of uses to the old town - and we made this walk from the Town Hall to here - we see what is happening in the old town. This is what should have happened from north to south', he said. Alcanena, with a global project for 308 homes and an investment of around 40.5 million euros, has already delivered 27 homes under the 1st Right and has another 68 under construction, with a total investment of 9 million euros. At the level of affordable housing, Alcanena delivered the first six homes on Monday, with another 145 under construction, 35 in public tender and 27 in project, with an investment of 31.5 million euros. According to the president of the Alcanena City Council, Rui Anast\u00e1cio, the municipality received 100 applications for the six homes that were delivered on Monday. 'We have a very large set of challenges, but in fact, this qualified offer of housing is one of the indispensable pieces of the puzzle to be able to combat this demographic winter that we are living in the country and in our region', he said.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 09:11 AM\nSource:[idealista.pt/news](https://www.idealista.pt/news/imobiliario/habitacao/2025/05/27/69890-governo-continua-a-acreditar-que-habitacao-do-prr-cumprira-prazos)\n\n**Weather Update: Red alert in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa due to early monsoon.

The Tijuana City Council is leading the works. Virginia Vargas, head of the Secretariat of Urban and Environmental Territorial Development (SDTUA), stated that the state is leading the works and has identified several factors: 'It is mentioned that it is also part of a pluvial, it is mentioned that it is a problem of leaks that were connected or connected at some point to drainage, which were made by private individuals.

Short-term relief may come in the form of weekend rain, but meteorologists caution it won't be enough to alleviate long-term drought conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 08, 2025 07:24 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/florida-sees-worst-drought-24-years-2069796)\n\n**May 2025 Drought Outlook shows Eastern Panhandle drought conditions persist - WV MetroNews**\nThe Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, including Berkeley, Jefferson, and Morgan counties, remains in 'Severe Drought' conditions, affecting 265,400 residents, according to the US Drought Monitor. This past March was the 5th driest on record since 1895. The US Drought Monitor predicts that drought conditions will persist but improve over the next month. Growers in the area are concerned, as the growing season is in full swing, and livestock farmers may need to plan ahead for feeding and watering their animals. In contrast, the middle and western areas of the state have been spared from abnormally dry conditions due to moisture-laden storm systems this spring, although the Potomac Highlands are in a moderate drought with some areas classified as 'abnormally dry'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 03, 2025 04:03 PM\nSource:[wvmetronews.com](https://wvmetronews.com/2025/05/03/may-2025-drought-outlook-shows-eastern-panhandle-drought-conditions-persist/)\n\n**Florida Faces Severe Environmental Crisis with Over 100 Active Wildfires**\nFlorida is facing a severe environmental crisis due to a lack of rainfall, high temperatures, and an alarming increase in wildfires. According to the National Weather Service, over 14 million people are currently living in areas affected by drought, which represents more than half of the state's population. The state is experiencing extreme dry conditions in the north, center, and south, including areas such as Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, and Miami. The county of Marion is in extreme drought, while others like Palm Beach and Hendry are facing severe water scarcity levels. The soil moisture is continuing to drop, and the forecasted rains will not be enough to reverse the situation. April is shaping up to be one of the driest months in five years, increasing the risk of wildfires. Currently, there are over 100 active wildfires, and the combination of dry vegetation and high temperatures makes any spark a real threat to entire communities. Florida is facing a growing environmental emergency, with over 100 active wildfires having already consumed more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. The prolonged drought, combined with high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds, has created ideal conditions for fires to spread quickly. At least 21 counties have issued burn bans to prevent new fires, while emergency services are working against the clock to contain the wildfires. Ground brigades, air support, and specialized teams are fighting day and night to protect residential areas and critical infrastructure. Environmental authorities have raised the alert levels due to the risk of flames approaching urban communities. The drought index shows no signs of improvement, and the lack of significant rainfall in the forecast is making the situation even more dire. Florida is in one of its most delicate situations in years, with impacts that could extend throughout the hot season if conditions do not change soon. As said by the authorities, 'the combination of dry vegetation and high temperatures makes any spark a real threat to entire communities.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 01, 2025 02:52 PM\nSource:[RPP noticias](https://rpp.pe/usa/actualidad/usa-incendios-forestales-y-sequia-extrema-golpean-a-florida-mas-de-100-focos-activos-estados-unidos-rppusa-noticia-1631805)\n\n**Almost one-third of Florida counties under burn bans as drought worsens.

This is 1 million more people than in the first quarter of the year. The Integrated Food Security Classification System (CIP) report estimates that in the first quarter of 2025, around 3.4 million inhabitants or 17% of the country's population will face acute food insecurity, following a decrease in agricultural production at the end of 2024 due to rainfall scarcity. St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the UN Secretary-General's spokesperson, warned on Wednesday about 'the deterioration of food security in the country.' The CIP analysis predicts that between April and June, 4.4 million men, women, and children (23% of the population) will suffer from acute food insecurity, among other things due to below-average monsoon rains, ongoing conflicts, high prices, and localized flooding. The report also estimates that 1.7 million children under the age of five (4% more than in 2024) will suffer from acute malnutrition and require treatment, including 466,000 in the category of severe acute malnutrition. 'The worsening drought, unpredictable rains, and ongoing conflict are eroding livelihoods, plunging families deeper into crisis,' said Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO Representative in Somalia, in a statement. According to the UN, nearly six million Somalis will need humanitarian aid in 2025. However, in a context of chronic underfunding, the humanitarian plan launched at the end of January requests $1.43 billion to help 4.6 million people as a priority.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[espanol.news.yahoo.com](https://es-us.finanzas.yahoo.com/noticias/4-4-millones-personas-amenazadas-104709704.html)\n\n**People are flocking to Florida. Will there be enough water for them?**\nFlorida is facing a looming water supply shortage due to an intensifying climate, overexploitation of groundwater, and a development boom. The state's groundwater supply is the primary source of drinking water for 90% of its 23 million inhabitants, but it is being depleted at an alarming rate. The Florida Office of Demographic Research reports that the state may experience a water supply shortage as soon as this year, with the problem escalating in coming decades. The state's population growth, driven by newcomers flocking to affordable housing, is exacerbating the issue. According to Sarah Burns, the planning manager for the city of Tampa, 'It's all a challenging paradigm shift,' as many Floridians take pride in lush, landscaped lawns and water-intensive irrigation systems. The city of Tampa already exceeds its water limit and has implemented a once-a-week lawn-watering restriction. The state's springs have lost over a third of their historic flow levels, and 80% are severely polluted. Advocates like Merrillee Malwitz-Jipson wonder if the state's 2024 Florida Water Plan, which includes expanding conservation of agricultural lands and investing in infrastructure and restoration projects, will be enough to address the issue. 'I don't know why the state of Florida keeps issuing all these permits,' she said. 'We are not ready, y'all. We do not have enough water for this.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 02:30 PM\nSource:[wmmo.com](https://www.wmmo.com/news/people-are-flocking-florida-will-there-be-enough-water-them/3EZLBNFFPVOIPID2HTOIVMVGR4/)\n\n**Somalia Monthly Humanitarian Update, January 2025**\nThe humanitarian situation in Somalia is expected to worsen due to drought conditions, with 5.98 million people in need of assistance in 2025. The drought, caused by poor rainfall and above-average temperatures, has already affected 10 regions, including Gedo, Hiran, and Bay. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the April to June gu seasonal rains will be below-normal, exacerbating the situation. Humanitarian agencies are urging immediate assistance, including borehole drilling, livestock support, and sustainable water management, to mitigate the crisis. At least 4.4 million people are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with 1.6 million children likely to suffer from acute malnutrition through July 2025. The Somalia Humanitarian Fund and Central Emergency Response Fund have allocated $10 million to address the crisis, focusing on health, nutrition, and WASH activities in affected areas.

The report, made by the Cemaden (Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais) with data from the Inpe, revealed that 111 cities in Brazil experienced extreme heat for more than 150 days. 'It's horrible. I'm only drinking water, and cold water at that. And ice cream,' said retired Marina Nascimento. The researchers confirm what has become common sense: in 2024, the hottest year on record, 6 million residents of 111 cities faced more than 150 days of extreme heat. Ana Paula Cunha, a researcher at the Cemaden, explains that the heat and drought are interconnected: 'We had a year, more than 24 months of dry conditions, mainly in the North, part of the Southeast, Center-West, which also contributes to the heat. The heat and drought feed back into each other.' The state that suffered the most was the Par\u00e1, where the residents of Melga\u00e7o faced the worst scenario: 228 days with extreme heat, with a maximum temperature of 38\u00b0C. 'It's a sun for each one. Only the strong survive. What can you do?

    "summary": "Across nine expert forecasts, there is strong consensus that Florida is experiencing an unusually severe, widespread drought as of late May 2025, with over 14 million residents\u2014more than half the state's population\u2014living in drought-affected areas. Most experts emphasize that the current drought's scope and intensity are the worst in at least a decade, with all major metropolitan areas (Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville) affected and large rainfall deficits persisting. \n\nSeveral forecasters highlight the typical beginning of the wet and hurricane season in June as a factor that could quickly alleviate drought conditions if widespread, heavy rainfall occurs\u2014particularly if a tropical system makes landfall. The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is forecast to be particularly active, increasing the statistical chance for such a correcting event. However, experts are split on whether this rainfall will arrive in time (by June 28) and whether it will be both substantial and geographically widespread enough to effect a large and rapid reduction in drought classification for population centers. \n\nMany experts cite historical base rates: entrenched droughts in Florida at the start of June can persist for several weeks, even after the rainy season begins, due to hydrological lag (soil and groundwater recovery). The Drought Monitor, the resolution source, is noted to sometimes lag in reclassifying drought improvements unless changes are significant and broadly distributed. Population growth and the tight overlap between drought-affected zones and urban areas make it likely that even partial improvement would still leave a large number of residents in drought, unless rainfall is extraordinary.\n\nProbabilities assigned by the experts to Florida having 14 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025, cluster mostly in the 60\u201390% range, with two notably lower outliers (30% and 35%) who give more weight to rapid wet-season improvements and the potential for fast drought relief from early tropical activity. The most cited scenario for a 'No' outcome relies on a timely tropical storm or an especially active, early wet season, while the 'Yes' scenario is more heavily favored: continued or only gradual rainfall, lagging drought response in the Drought Monitor, and high entrenched population exposure.\n\nIn short, the expert consensus is that a 'Yes' outcome (\u226514 million residents in drought on June 28) is more likely, due to the extraordinary drought severity, population distribution, hydrological and classification lags, and only modest probability of an early, drought-busting tropical event. The probability of 'Yes' as aggregated from all forecasts averages in the low to mid-70% range."
