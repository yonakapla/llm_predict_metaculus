However, 1) ENSO cooling could exert enough downward pressure in the northern spring, and 2) not every month in a record year is itself a new record. NOAA's own preliminary probability for 2025 being the warmest year (as of April/May) is just 3\u20137%, but this is for the annual statistic; the monthly probability for May being a record is likely higher due to strong ocean and land heat signals.

Additionally, NOAA's own annual forecast assigns just ~3\u20137% odds to 2025 as a whole being warmer than 2024. Historically, monthly global records coincide with annual record candidates, but May is early in the La Ni\u00f1a season; La Ni\u00f1a cooling is often lagged, yet global warmth remains robust and may make for a tight race. Thus, my best estimate\u2014balancing strong multi-year warmth, continued oceanic heat, a slight base rate bias for monthly records in this epoch, but also moderation in the latest observed anomalies and the inhibiting effect of La Ni\u00f1a onset\u2014is that there is about a 22% chance that May 2025 will be the hottest May on NOAA's global land+ocean record.",

The only reason not to go even higher (e.g., above 90%) is that, per NOAA, the forecasted chance for 2025 as a full year to break the record is in the low single digits.

Given the base rate of new records set in 2023-2025, April 2025's nearly record warmth, ocean data, and the tendency for NOAA to revise slightly upward on further data integration, I judge the probability that May 2025 is NOAA's hottest May on record as high: 78%.",

In 2023-2025, the Earth has experienced persistently record-breaking temperatures, with January and April 2025 both at or near historic highs. Ocean surface temperatures remain far above historical norms, suggesting underlying drivers are still present.

Right now, the signals point to moderation\u2014not a steamroll to new records. Recalibrate your risk to reflect the end of the El Ni\u00f1o driver; 72% is overexcited, not evidence-based."

The seasonal models and physical reasoning around the La Ni\u00f1a transition are underappreciated by most here, but crucial: these transitions usually cause global anomalies to flatten or retreat. You also note that May is less 'ENSO-sensitive' than July or August, further explaining why chasing extremes in May after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o is folly. Your read of NOAA's full-year probability anchor as inconsistent with massive monthly odds is spot-on.

While the long-term anomaly regime and high ocean heat content still keep the chance of a new May record elevated, the sharply reduced probabilities assigned by NOAA for the annual record, as well as the demonstrated 'softening' evidenced by April, show the regime shift's effect is not one-way. I also found the points made by EnvironmentalDataScienceTimeSeriesAnalysis compelling: the transition to La Ni\u00f1a and the high bar set in 2024 mean that a new May record is less likely than my initial estimate suggested.

Additionally, NOAA's own forecast for 2025 being an annual record low (3\u20137%) is a strong tempering force. While some forecasters pointed to regime shifts and structural warming, their probabilities were inflated by recency bias and do not sufficiently account for physical or statistical headwinds. At the same time, the most conservative (22\u201327%) probabilities arguably underweight the inertia of ongoing heat.

Several compelling critiques (notably by 'EnvironmentalDataScienceTimeSeriesAnalysis', 'ClimatologyGlobalSurfaceTemperatureDataset', and 'MeteorologySeasonalForecastingModels') pointed out that while regimes have shifted, the bar for monthly records is higher post-El Ni\u00f1o, and the trend of broken records cannot be mechanically assumed.

The recency bias in some high-end forecasts was called out, and there was consensus among empirically grounded contributors (ClimatologyGlobalSurfaceTemperatureDataset, NoaaReportingProtocolsGlobalHistoricalClimatologyNetwork, and my own polemics) that the base rate, ENSO dynamics, and most recent monthly data all argue for a notably sub-50% probability.

The report also states that it is almost certain that one of the next years will reach a temperature of 2.7\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C) above the pre-industrial level. This means not just heatwaves, but also catastrophic events that will cost people their lives, health, and safety. 'It's quite gloomy', says Mike Flannigan from the University of Thompson Rivers, who believes that the real consequences will be even more severe than expected. The western regions of the US are already suffering from wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves. As climate scientist Pak Williams notes, 'The western US has warmed, but without increased precipitation to compensate for the effect'. The Arctic, Amazon, Africa, and Europe are becoming the poles of a new climate reality, with melting ice, excessive rainfall, and severe droughts. The warming atmosphere holds more moisture, increasing the risk of storms and floods. 'Episodes of climate 'tipping points' are becoming more intense', the report states. Seasonal fluctuations from wet to dry have become a precursor to wildfires in California. Flannigan warns: 'People think it won't affect them. But soon it will be on every backyard'. The data shows that 2024 has already become the hottest year since 1880, and this trend is only intensifying. 11 consecutive years of temperature records have been set, and there is no end in sight. The situation in the US is complicated by the political inconsistency in addressing climate change. The withdrawal from the Paris Agreement initiated by the Trump administration, along with the imposed bans on terms such as 'climate science', demonstrate a deliberate rollback of scientific efforts. The administration has fired over 400 experts who worked on the National Climate Assessment. As Ko Barrett from the WMO notes, 'The negative impact on our economy, lives, ecosystems, and planet will grow'. The NOAA budget plans to cut 25%, which will undermine the ability to predict and prevent disasters. This is a refusal to take responsibility in the face of an ecological crisis. The WMO estimates a 70% probability that the average warming in 2025-2029 will exceed 1.5\u00b0C, indicating a real risk of irreversible changes. High temperatures accelerate ecosystem degradation, reduce yields, and trigger new catastrophes. The world is entering a phase where inaction threatens the very existence of civilization. The impact of warming has already engulfed not only climate, but also politics, economy, security, and even basic living conditions. Societies must act quickly to reduce damage - or agree to a future where anomalies become the norm.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https://newsyou.info/2025/06/vmo-poperedzhaye-zemlya-pobye-temperaturni-rekordi)\n\n**Earth on Fire: Why the Next Five Years Could Be the Hottest Ever**\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the next five years (2025-2029) are expected to be the hottest on record, with global temperatures projected to remain at or near record levels. This forecast underscores the urgency of addressing climate change and its far-reaching impacts. The WMO's 'Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update' outlines several key projections, including a significant increase in risk, with the likelihood of the five-year average exceeding 1.5\u00b0C increasing to 47% from 32%. The Arctic region is projected to warm more than three and a half times faster than the global average over the next five extended winters.

The study, conducted by scientists from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, found that approximately 4 billion people, or 49% of the global population, experienced at least 30 days of extreme heat between May 2024 and May 2025, more than would have been expected without human-caused global warming. The study used a peer-reviewed climate model to compare real-world data with a simulated world without human activity. The results showed that there were 67 extreme heat events worldwide last year, all clearly linked to climate change. The Caribbean island of Aruba was the most affected, experiencing 187 days of extreme heat, 45 more than would have been expected without global warming. These findings come after a record-breaking year for temperature, with 2024 officially the hottest year on record and January 2025 the hottest January ever recorded. The global temperature has risen by 1.3\u00b0C over the past five years, surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the Paris Agreement to prevent catastrophic climate impacts. The report warns that developing countries are not only vulnerable to heat but also to data gaps. For example, in 2022, 61,000 heat-related deaths were reported in Europe, but similar data is lacking in many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The report calls for immediate global action, including: early warning systems for heatwaves, heatwave education, heat action plans, building improvements such as better ventilation and shading, and behavioral changes such as staying indoors during extreme heat. However, the authors emphasize that adaptation measures alone will not be enough and that the only way to stop the deteriorating patterns is to rapidly cut fossil fuel use and switch to clean energy.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 02:35 PM\nSource:[Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd](https://hindi.asianetnews.com/world-news/human-caused-climate-change-leads-to-a-month-of-extra-extreme-heat-globally/articleshow-5tyw9sa)\n\n**A warming planet is poised to get even hotter, forecasters warn**\nA new report from the World Meteorological Organization warns that the planet is poised to get even hotter, with a high chance of the world shattering the record for the hottest year in nearly two centuries by 2029.

Climate scientists warn that the consequences of warming will be severe, including more frequent and intense natural disasters, droughts, and failed crop seasons. 'It's pretty bleak,' said Mike Flannigan, a fire scientist at Thompson Rivers University. 'My fear is that [the coming years] will be even warmer than they suggest, and the impacts will continue to catch us by surprise and be more severe than we expect.' The report also found that the U.S. will likely head into this period of climate chaos with a drastically reduced ability to forecast disasters and head off their worst consequences due to budget cuts and a wider turn away from climate mitigation efforts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 02:47 AM\nSource:[phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2025-05-planet-poised-hotter.html)\n\n**Summer 2025 forecast calls for 'overwhelmingly above normal' heat starting in June**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center has forecast an 'overwhelmingly above normal' heat for the summer of 2025, starting in June. According to Johnna Infanti, a meteorologist for NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, model guidance indicates that the U.S. and most of Alaska will experience hotter-than-normal temperatures. The hottest temperatures are expected in the West, Southwest, Florida, and New England. The summer forecast also calls for an overall hotter and drier season, with below-normal precipitation in the Northwest, Northern Rockies, and Great Plains, and drought persisting or expanding in these regions. The Eastern U.S. is expected to see a wetter summer, including drought relief later in June. Additionally, parts of the nation have a greater likelihood of significant wildfires, particularly in the coastal Southeast, central Texas, the Four Corners, and parts of California and the Pacific Northwest in June, and in Hawaii, the Southern Plains, and parts of the Great Basin, California, and the Northwest in July and August.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/05/31/summer-2025-heat-forecast/83942266007/)\n\n**WMO Warns: Earth on Track to Break Temperature Records**\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warns that the Earth is on track to break temperature records in the coming years, with a 80% chance that one of the years between 2025-2029 will be warmer than 2024.

High temperatures accelerate ecosystem degradation, reduce yields, and trigger new catastrophes. The world is entering a phase where inaction threatens the very existence of civilization. The impact of warming has already engulfed not only climate, but also politics, economy, security, and even basic living conditions. Societies must act quickly to reduce damage - or agree to a future where anomalies become the norm.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https://newsyou.info/2025/06/vmo-poperedzhaye-zemlya-pobye-temperaturni-rekordi)\n\n**Unprecedented Arctic Warming: Implications for Global Climate Patterns**\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned of continued global warming in the next five years, with temperatures expected to remain at record-breaking or near-record levels. This will exacerbate climate-related risks to global communities and economies, and threaten sustainable development pathways. The report highlights several key messages, including: There is an 80% chance that one of the next five years (2025-2029) will be the 'hottest year on record', surpassing the record set in 2024. There is an 86% chance that one of the next five years will see a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial average (1850-1900). The report shows that there is a 70% chance that global warming will exceed 1.5\u00b0C during the period (2025-2029). Despite these alarming forecasts, the report notes that long-term warming, measured over decades, has not yet reached the 1.5\u00b0C threshold agreed upon in the Paris Agreement. However, the continued upward trend in temperatures suggests that it may be exceeded in the near future if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. There is an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years (2025-2029) will break the record for the hottest year on record since temperature records began (set in 2024). There is an 86% chance that temperatures will rise by at least 1.5\u00b0C in one of the next five years compared to the pre-industrial average. The report does not provide global predictions for each year individually. Breaking any additional degree of warming will lead to more severe heatwaves, extreme weather events, and glacier melting, as well as rising sea levels and ocean temperatures. The Arctic region is expected to continue to experience higher rates of warming than the global average, which may lead to significant environmental changes, including sea ice melting and rising sea levels. The region is expected to experience temperatures 2.4\u00b0C above the global average during the next five winters (November to March), which is more than three and a half times the global average. The predictions for sea ice show a decrease in sea ice concentrations in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas from March 2025 to March 2029. The report notes that precipitation patterns will show a clear variation between geographical regions, with some areas expected to become wetter, while others may experience more severe droughts, directly affecting agriculture, water, and food security. South Asia has experienced above-average rainfall in recent years, except for 2023, and forecasts suggest that this trend will continue during the period 2025-2029. However, this may not apply to all seasons in each year of these five years.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[\u0637\u0642\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628](https://www.arabiaweather.com/content/%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%82-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A1%D9%8B-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A4%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%B0%D9%84%D9%83-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%82%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9%D8%9F)\n\n**Earth on Fire: Why the Next Five Years Could Be the Hottest Ever**\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the next five years (2025-2029) are expected to be the hottest on record, with global temperatures projected to remain at or near record levels. This forecast underscores the urgency of addressing climate change and its far-reaching impacts. The WMO's 'Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update' outlines several key projections, including a significant increase in risk, with the likelihood of the five-year average exceeding 1.5\u00b0C increasing to 47% from 32%.

The study, conducted by scientists from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, found that approximately 4 billion people, or 49% of the global population, experienced at least 30 days of extreme heat between May 2024 and May 2025, more than would have been expected without human-caused global warming. The study used a peer-reviewed climate model to compare real-world data with a simulated world without human activity. The results showed that there were 67 extreme heat events worldwide last year, all clearly linked to climate change. The Caribbean island of Aruba was the most affected, experiencing 187 days of extreme heat, 45 more than would have been expected without global warming. These findings come after a record-breaking year for temperature, with 2024 officially the hottest year on record and January 2025 the hottest January ever recorded. The global temperature has risen by 1.3\u00b0C over the past five years, surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the Paris Agreement to prevent catastrophic climate impacts. The report warns that developing countries are not only vulnerable to heat but also to data gaps. For example, in 2022, 61,000 heat-related deaths were reported in Europe, but similar data is lacking in many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The report calls for immediate global action, including: early warning systems for heatwaves, heatwave education, heat action plans, building improvements such as better ventilation and shading, and behavioral changes such as staying indoors during extreme heat. However, the authors emphasize that adaptation measures alone will not be enough and that the only way to stop the deteriorating patterns is to rapidly cut fossil fuel use and switch to clean energy.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 02:35 PM\nSource:[Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd](https://hindi.asianetnews.com/world-news/human-caused-climate-change-leads-to-a-month-of-extra-extreme-heat-globally/articleshow-5tyw9sa)\n\n**A warming planet is poised to get even hotter, forecasters warn**\nA new report from the World Meteorological Organization warns that the planet is poised to get even hotter, with a high chance of the world shattering the record for the hottest year in nearly two centuries by 2029. The report found an 80% chance that at least one year in the 2025 to 2029 period will surpass 2024 as the warmest year on record, and an 86% chance that at least one of those years will exceed the 2.7 degrees warming target. Climate scientists warn that the consequences of warming will be severe, including more frequent and intense natural disasters, droughts, and failed crop seasons. 'It's pretty bleak,' said Mike Flannigan, a fire scientist at Thompson Rivers University. 'My fear is that [the coming years] will be even warmer than they suggest, and the impacts will continue to catch us by surprise and be more severe than we expect.' The report also found that the U.S. will likely head into this period of climate chaos with a drastically reduced ability to forecast disasters and head off their worst consequences due to budget cuts and a wider turn away from climate mitigation efforts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 01, 2025 02:47 AM\nSource:[phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2025-05-planet-poised-hotter.html)\n\n**Record Temperatures Threaten the World Over the Next Five Years**\nAccording to a new report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global temperature is expected to remain at a record or near-record level over the next five years, increasing climate risks and having negative consequences for society, economy, and development. The report states that the global average annual ground temperature for each year from 2025 to 2029 will be 1.2-1.9 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, which is the average temperature from 1850 to 1900. There is an 85% probability that at least one year in this period will be warmer than the hottest year on record, 2024. The report also predicts a 70% probability that the average warming over the five years will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold set by the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Each additional degree of warming will lead to more intense heatwaves, extreme precipitation, severe droughts, glacier melting, ocean warming, and sea level rise. Additionally, the report forecasts that the warming in the Arctic will occur more than 3.5 times faster than the global average during the next five extended winter periods. The predicted state of sea ice for March 2025-2029 suggests a further decrease in ice concentration in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas. As WMO Director-General Petteri Taalas said, 'The next five years are critical in the fight against climate change.

The researchers found a climate change fingerprint in every heatwave they studied. The study found that 67 heatwaves occurred last year, with the most affected area being the Caribbean island of Aruba, which recorded 187 days of extreme heat, 45 more than expected in the absence of climate change. The study comes after a record-breaking year for global temperatures, with 2024 being the hottest year on record, surpassing 2023, and January 2023 being the hottest January ever recorded. The global temperature has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with 2024 alone exceeding the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold set by the Paris Agreement. The researchers emphasize the importance of early warning systems, public awareness, and city-specific climate action plans. They also highlight the need to improve building design, including shading and ventilation, and to adjust behaviors, such as avoiding strenuous activities during peak heat.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 31, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6591072)\n\n**Summer 2025 forecast calls for 'overwhelmingly above normal' heat starting in June**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center has forecast an 'overwhelmingly above normal' heat for the summer of 2025, starting in June.

The report also states that the past decade has been the warmest on record, with each year being the hottest ever recorded. The WMO warns that the planet is experiencing a 'spiral of climate and meteorological impacts' due to global warming, with some consequences being irreversible for hundreds or thousands of years. The report highlights the devastating consequences of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods, and droughts, which have caused significant loss of life and economic damage. The WMO Secretary-General, Celeste Saulo, stated, 'The data for 2024 shows that our oceans have continued to warm and sea levels have continued to rise.' She added, 'The cryosphere, the frozen parts of the Earth's surface, is melting at an alarming rate: glaciers are continuing to retreat and the Antarctic ice has reached its second-lowest extent ever recorded.' The report also notes that at least 152 extreme weather events without precedent occurred globally in 2024, resulting in the highest number of climate-related displacements in 16 years. 'The clear signs of human responsibility in these changes have reached new heights in 2024,' the report states. Stephen Belcher, Chief Scientist of the UK's Met Office, said, 'The last check-up on the health of the planet tells us that the Earth is deeply ill. Many vital signs are sounding the alarm.'

Despite the expected cooling effect of La Ni\u00f1a, the global warming trend has overwhelmed natural climate variability. Scientists are concerned that extreme weather events will continue to worsen. The NOAA and ECMWF data show that the global ocean surface temperature remains above historical averages, indicating that the Earth continues to warm, with no signs of cooling. The rapid increase in ocean warming has led to changes in global climate patterns, affecting wind patterns, precipitation, and even exacerbating extreme weather events. Additionally, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise, with no signs of slowing down. Scientists point out that the reduction in air pollution has led to a 'climate feedback effect' change, which has contributed to the acceleration of global warming. If left unchecked, the global warming trend will continue to worsen, with more frequent and severe extreme weather events, threatening global food security and ecosystem stability.

These records bring the world closer to the limits set by the Paris Agreement, which aims to contain global warming below 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[jornalsemanario.com.br](https://jornalsemanario.com.br/planeta-registra-janeiro-mais-quente-da-historia-com-175c-acima-do-nivel-pre-industrial/)\n\n**2025 May Become One of the Hottest Years in History, According to Russian Meteorological Center**\nAccording to Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia, 2025 may become one of the hottest years in history, possibly entering the top three or five warmest years on record. However, the calculations are still being refined, Vilfand said in an interview with RIA Novosti. 'Several forecasts suggested that this year would be among the top three or five warmest, and one forecast even predicted it would be second. But these are just calculations that remind me of inflation forecasts. We shouldn't take this seriously for now. This forecast will be refined in the middle of the year,' Vilfand noted. The abnormally high temperatures in 2024 were linked to the natural phenomenon of El Ni\u00f1o, which involves a rise in sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. This process affects global air and ocean circulation, leading to an increase in average global temperatures. El Ni\u00f1o lasted from May 2023 to April 2024, after which it transitioned to a neutral phase. However, its impact persisted, making 2024 the hottest year on record. Now, El Ni\u00f1o has been replaced by its opposite, La Ni\u00f1a, which involves cooling of the Pacific Ocean waters and affects the climate worldwide. According to preliminary forecasts, La Ni\u00f1a will be short-lived, transitioning to a neutral phase in April 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[siapress.ru](https://www.siapress.ru/news/133980-okonchatelnie-dannie-o-temperaturnih-rekordah-2025-goda-poyavyatsya-v-seredine-goda)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters approach the question of whether NOAA will report May 2025 as the hottest May on record from a range of backgrounds, including environmental data science, climatology, meteorology, statistics, and operational climate reporting. Several key points and consensus factors emerge:\n\n- All experts agree that May 2025 faces strong upward pressure from persistent anthropogenic (human-caused) warming, with the years 2023, 2024, and early 2025 featuring a streak of record global temperatures.\n- The background ocean heat, particularly exceptionally high sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and oceanic heat content, continues to support anomalous global warmth, raising the probability of new records.\n- However, the transition from strong El Ni\u00f1o conditions (which generally boost global temperatures) to neutral or La Ni\u00f1a conditions by mid-2025 introduces a cooling tendency. This (alongside typical regression to the mean after an extreme record year) is cited by all forecasters as a moderating influence, reducing the probability of yet another record.\n- Recent data is mixed: January 2025 set an all-time monthly record, but April 2025 was narrowly the second warmest April, breaking a streak of record months and suggesting possible downward inertia for May unless exceptional warmth continued.\n- Experts using statistical and anomaly-detection frameworks highlight that in eras of rapid warming (as currently seen), records tend to cluster, temporarily increasing the base probability of new records versus the long-term historical average.\n- NOAA and other agency model forecasts emphasize that while ongoing records are possible, the probability for 2025 as a whole to be warmer than 2024 is only around 3\u20137%. Monthly odds for May 2025 being the warmest are generally regarded as significantly higher than this, but still far from certain or overwhelming.\n\nProbabilities among the experts range from 22% (reflecting skepticism due to waning El Ni\u00f1o, regression, and April's data) up to the high 70s (where extreme value theory and climate-forcing models emphasize the possibility of clustered records and dominant persistent warming). The modal grouping is between 40-72%, with most forecasters converging around a substantial but sub-even-chance likelihood, weighted toward the substantial background warming but tempered by recent small step-down in global temperature extremes and ENSO phase change.\n\nThe main pathways to a \"No\" outcome involve the La Ni\u00f1a transition and random month-to-month variability nudging May's temperature anomaly just below 2024's record, as was seen in April. The \"Yes\" scenario hinges on the persistence of exceptional ocean and land warmth slightly edging May 2025 above May 2024.\n\nIn summary, experts highlight strong but not dominant odds for May 2025 being the hottest May on record, with a central probability range around 40\u201370%\u2014well above the long-term base rate, but acknowledging the increasing challenge of setting new records after an exceptional previous year and the moderating effect of developing La Ni\u00f1a conditions."
