You gloss over the deep institutional drag, tone-deaf to a half-century of protocol, internal paranoia in Beijing, and the well-documented rigidity of Chinese elite hospitality. If leader whims alone moved mountains, we\u2019d see routine surprise visits\u2014yet that's completely at odds with observable fact.

The absence of even a hint of operational movement (flight manifests, security presence, official press leaks) is especially telling.

Defenses of moderately low estimates (8-15%) confirm that, while mutual invitations and Trump's penchant for surprises add some nonzero chance, logistical, political, and procedural inertia are simply too great to ignore.

The thoughtful defenses of a low probability, especially those citing the lack of leaks, scheduling evidence, or machinery in motion, further reinforce my view. No new, credible signals of imminent travel exist, and the barriers to short-notice head-of-state trips in this context remain immense.

This is the fastest overseas trip by a South Korean president since the country's founding. The president's 'national interest-centered practical diplomacy' approach will be put to the test at the summit, where he will meet with leaders of major countries, including US President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The president's visit to the G7 summit comes at a critical time, as the international community is watching his handling of sensitive issues such as trade and security. The president's meeting with Trump is expected to focus on trade and security issues, including the renegotiation of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement. The president's meeting with Kishida will also be closely watched, as the two leaders have agreed to strengthen their countries' relations. The president's visit to the G7 summit is also seen as an opportunity to strengthen the Korea-US alliance and the Korea-Japan relationship, which have been strained in recent years. However, the president's approach to diplomacy has been criticized for being too focused on national interests, and some experts warn that this could lead to a deterioration in relations with neighboring countries, including China and Russia.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 15, 2025 07:12 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250615035400001)\n\n**President Yoon to Attend G7 Summit, First Overseas Diplomatic Trip**\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15 to 17, marking his first overseas diplomatic trip. The summit will be an opportunity to showcase his 'practical diplomacy centered on national interests.' The summit will also be a chance for President Yoon to demonstrate his diplomatic skills on the international stage. The summit will discuss issues such as China's influence and the US's protectionist trade policies. Additionally, there is a possibility of a bilateral meeting between President Yoon and US President Donald Trump. According to the presidential spokesperson, Kang Yu-jeong, President Yoon and President Trump had a phone call on June 6, during which they agreed to meet as soon as possible, either in a multilateral setting or in a bilateral visit. The spokesperson said that the call was a successful one, as it helped to build trust and rapport between the two leaders.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: June 15, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Korea Mt System                    ](https://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2025061510175931335)\n\n**Trump-Xi Phone Call Sparks Multiple Reactions**\nAfter a phone call between US President Trump and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping, multiple effects have been triggered. Firstly, the US-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9. The US side has taken a tough stance, with the US Secretary of Commerce stating that the US will propose to China that China's scholars attempted to bring agricultural terror pathogens into the US. Secondly, Trump invited Xi to visit the US, but the CCP's statement was strange, seemingly strengthening the rumor that Xi's power is waning. Russia also does not trust the CCP, with leaked Russian security documents showing that Russia activated anti-spy operations three days before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to prevent CCP infiltration. Meanwhile, the CCP secretly strengthened the recruitment of potential spies. Trump's phone call with Xi has sparked a series of reactions, with some saying that Trump has retreated, while others believe it is a negotiating tactic. The CCP's statement only mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China, but did not mention Xi's invitation to visit the US. This has led to speculation that Xi is unwilling to visit the US or has lost the opportunity to do so. The CCP's leader Xi Jinping has been questioned for his unusual behavior, with some speculating that he has lost power. Trump said that Xi invited him to visit China, and he accepted, and also invited Xi to visit the US, saying that Xi also 'hopes' to come to the US. However, the CCP's statement only mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China, but did not mention Xi's invitation to visit the US. This has led to speculation that Xi is unwilling to visit the US or has lost the opportunity to do so. Russia's security documents show that Russia activated anti-spy operations three days before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to prevent CCP infiltration. The CCP secretly strengthened the recruitment of potential spies. The new South Korean president, Lee Jae-myung, has spoken with Trump and agreed to quickly reach a trade agreement. The US has urged its major trading partners to submit their proposals by June 4, and the US and China will meet in London on June 9. The key factor is whether the US and South Korea can reach a trade agreement. Lee Jae-myung has spoken with Trump and agreed to quickly reach a trade agreement. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:20 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/6/11/n14529421.htm)\n\n**Trump's Trade War: Key Dates and Events to Watch**\nThe trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump has caused significant uncertainty in global financial markets, with investors experiencing a rollercoaster ride. According to a Reuters analysis, the war has resulted in over $34 billion in lost sales and increased costs for companies. The uncertainty is compounded by legal challenges related to tariffs and Trump's claim that he will close bilateral trade agreements with key partners - agreements that remain elusive, except for the recent pact with the UK. Here are the key events and dates that may influence US trade policy: On June 11, 2025, Trump claims that the US-China trade agreement is finalized, with China providing magnets and rare earth minerals to the US. A White House official states that the agreement allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China will impose a 10% tariff on US imports. The agreement is subject to final approval from Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. From June 15-17, Trump will attend the annual G7 summit in Canada, where tariffs are expected to be a major topic of discussion. On July 8, the 'Day of Liberation' tariffs will come into effect after a 90-day suspension, potentially affecting imports from various countries. On July 9, the deadline for the US and EU to negotiate a deal to avoid a 50% tariff on all EU imports will expire. On July 14, the EU's 90-day pause on its retaliatory tariffs will end. 'It's a wild ride for investors,' said a source, 'as they try to navigate the ever-changing trade landscape.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/news/economy-news/guerra-comercial-de-trump-prazos-tarifarios-e-principais-eventos-futuros-1581366)\n\n**Trump and Xi Agree to Meet Amid Escalating Trade War**\nUS President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to meet in person, despite an ongoing and escalating trade war. According to Trump, the date and location of the summit will be announced later. Trump also appreciated the invitation to China, which was extended by the Chinese government. This development comes as a welcome respite from the unprecedented escalation of tariffs initiated by Trump against all countries, including China, since taking office in January. The last time Trump and Xi met was in 2019 at the G20 summit in Japan, where they agreed to reduce tariffs by 115% for 90 days. However, the current trade war is on a much larger scale, with the US imposing monumental tariffs and making more serious accusations against China. China has had time to prepare and adapt to the reality of a more reluctant US trade partner, and has expanded its trade to other markets.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[escenariomundial.com](https://www.escenariomundial.com/2025/06/11/trump-y-xi-aceptaron-reunirse-en-persona-en-medio-de-una-guerra-comercial-descontrolada-que-paso-la-ultima-vez/)\n\n**President Yoon Suk-yeol's First Overseas Trip: A Test of His Diplomatic Skills**\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol will attend the G7 summit in Canada on June 16-18, marking his first overseas trip since taking office on June 10.

Firstly, the US-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9. The US side has taken a tough stance, with the US Secretary of Commerce stating that the US will propose to China that China's scholars attempted to bring agricultural terror pathogens into the US. Secondly, Trump invited Xi to visit the US, but the CCP's statement was strange, seemingly strengthening the rumor that Xi's power is waning. Russia also does not trust the CCP, with leaked Russian security documents showing that Russia activated anti-spy operations three days before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to prevent CCP infiltration. Meanwhile, the CCP secretly strengthened the recruitment of potential spies. Trump's phone call with Xi has sparked a series of reactions, with some saying that Trump has retreated, while others believe it is a negotiating tactic. The CCP's statement only mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China, but did not mention Xi's invitation to visit the US. This has led to speculation that Xi is unwilling to visit the US or has lost the opportunity to do so. The CCP's leader Xi Jinping has been questioned for his unusual behavior, with some speculating that he has lost power. Trump said that Xi invited him to visit China, and he accepted, and also invited Xi to visit the US, saying that Xi also 'hopes' to come to the US. However, the CCP's statement only mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China, but did not mention Xi's invitation to visit the US. This has led to speculation that Xi is unwilling to visit the US or has lost the opportunity to do so. Russia's security documents show that Russia activated anti-spy operations three days before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to prevent CCP infiltration. The CCP secretly strengthened the recruitment of potential spies. The new South Korean president, Lee Jae-myung, has spoken with Trump and agreed to quickly reach a trade agreement. The US has urged its major trading partners to submit their proposals by June 4, and the US and China will meet in London on June 9. The key factor is whether the US and South Korea can reach a trade agreement. Lee Jae-myung has spoken with Trump and agreed to quickly reach a trade agreement. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:20 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/6/11/n14529421.htm)\n\n**Trump's Trade War: Key Dates and Events to Watch**\nThe trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump has caused significant uncertainty in global financial markets, with investors experiencing a rollercoaster ride. According to a Reuters analysis, the war has resulted in over $34 billion in lost sales and increased costs for companies. The uncertainty is compounded by legal challenges related to tariffs and Trump's claim that he will close bilateral trade agreements with key partners - agreements that remain elusive, except for the recent pact with the UK. Here are the key events and dates that may influence US trade policy: On June 11, 2025, Trump claims that the US-China trade agreement is finalized, with China providing magnets and rare earth minerals to the US. A White House official states that the agreement allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China will impose a 10% tariff on US imports. The agreement is subject to final approval from Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. From June 15-17, Trump will attend the annual G7 summit in Canada, where tariffs are expected to be a major topic of discussion. On July 8, the 'Day of Liberation' tariffs will come into effect after a 90-day suspension, potentially affecting imports from various countries. On July 9, the deadline for the US and EU to negotiate a deal to avoid a 50% tariff on all EU imports will expire. On July 14, the EU's 90-day pause on its retaliatory tariffs will end. 'It's a wild ride for investors,' said a source, 'as they try to navigate the ever-changing trade landscape.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/news/economy-news/guerra-comercial-de-trump-prazos-tarifarios-e-principais-eventos-futuros-1581366)\n\n**Trump touts 'done' deal on China trade truce**\nUS President Donald Trump announced that a deal has been reached with China on a trade truce, saying 'Our deal with China is done.' According to Trump, China will supply rare earth minerals and magnets to the US, while the US will allow Chinese students to remain in US universities. The deal is subject to final approval from Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump also stated that the US will apply 55% tariffs on Chinese goods, while China will charge 10% duties on US goods. The rates are the same as those previously agreed in the truce. US stock markets showed little enthusiasm despite Trump's announcement. Chinese officials, including Vice Premier He Lifeng and China International Trade Representative Li Chenggang, expressed a desire to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in future dialogue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 03:18 PM\nSource:[Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3047441/trump-touts-done-deal-on-china-trade-truce)\n\n**Trump and Xi Agree to Meet Amid Escalating Trade War**\nUS President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to meet in person, despite an ongoing and escalating trade war. According to Trump, the date and location of the summit will be announced later. Trump also appreciated the invitation to China, which was extended by the Chinese government. This development comes as a welcome respite from the unprecedented escalation of tariffs initiated by Trump against all countries, including China, since taking office in January. The last time Trump and Xi met was in 2019 at the G20 summit in Japan, where they agreed to reduce tariffs by 115% for 90 days. However, the current trade war is on a much larger scale, with the US imposing monumental tariffs and making more serious accusations against China. China has had time to prepare and adapt to the reality of a more reluctant US trade partner, and has expanded its trade to other markets.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[escenariomundial.com](https://www.escenariomundial.com/2025/06/11/trump-y-xi-aceptaron-reunirse-en-persona-en-medio-de-una-guerra-comercial-descontrolada-que-paso-la-ultima-vez/)\n\n**Trump scores double hit on trade: new truce with China and Appellate Court gives two months for reciprocal tariffs**\nThe Trump administration has scored a double hit on the commercial front. In London, the US and Chinese delegations announced that they have reached a framework agreement on the reinstatement of the truce that had seen the two countries suspend most of their respective tariffs. Meanwhile, at home, Trump has secured a two-month extension, until July 31, of the suspension of the so-called reciprocal tariffs against dozens of countries, which were deemed illegal in first instance by a special federal trade court. According to the delegations, the agreement effectively reinstates the pact signed in Geneva, after both parties had denounced violations. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said that the agreement was reached through a 'handshake', which will now be brought to President Donald Trump and President Xin Jinping. A high-ranking official in Beijing, along with the chief negotiator, Vice Premier He Lifeng, confirmed that the parties have reached a 'principle agreement'. No details on the content have emerged yet. Among the most difficult substantive issues that had caused the impasse, access to US rare earths and critical minerals and China's access to US-made semiconductors for artificial intelligence were key. On the second point, the Appellate Court has accepted the White House's request to maintain the reciprocal tariffs for now. Those tariffs are currently largely suspended, except for a 10% universal tariff, but could take effect on July 9 if Washington's partners, including the EU, do not reach comprehensive agreements on trade. The only country that has signed a provisional agreement so far is the UK. The Court has decided to hear the merits of the case on July 31. The case may subsequently reach the Supreme Court. The US Court of International Trade had recently declared the reciprocal tariffs imposed by Trump under a national economic emergency law to be illegal, stating that the President had abused his powers. The case was brought by five small businesses. The appellate judges, however, had frozen the sentence in response to Trump's immediate appeal.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 05:30 AM\nSource:[Il Sole 24 ORE](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/trump-doppio-colpo-commercio-nuova-tregua-la-cina-e-corte-d-appello-da-due-mesi-dazi-reciproci-AHJ8WpCB)\n\n**Trump touts 'done' deal with Beijing on rare earths, Chinese students**\nUS President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that a deal with China has been reached after two days of talks.

Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, 'Our deal with China is done,' but noted that the agreement is still 'subject to final approval with President Xi and me.' The deal includes China supplying 'full magnets, and any necessary rare earths... up front,' and the US applying 55% tariffs on Chinese goods, with China charging 10% duties on US goods. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in London that US measures imposed on rare earths would likely be relaxed once Beijing moves forward with more license approvals. Chinese officials, including Vice Premier He Lifeng and China International Trade Representative Li Chenggang, expressed optimism about the deal, with He Lifeng saying that the two sides should 'continuously enhance consensus, reduce misunderstandings and strengthen cooperation.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 11, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[thenews.com.pk](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1320191-trump-touts-done-deal-with-beijing-on-rare-earths-chinese-students)\n\n**Trump Announces Positive Trade Talks with China**\nUS President Donald Trump described his phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping as 'very good'.

The call, the first between the two leaders since Trump launched a trade war with China in February, was focused on trade and resulted in a 'very positive conclusion for both countries'.

Trump did not specify a date for the meeting. This comes after a series of recent visits to the US by leaders of India, France, the UK, and Ireland. Bloomberg notes that high-ranking leaders of China and the US typically visit each other's countries in rotation, so Trump should have visited Beijing before hosting Xi, as Xi was supposed to visit California in late 2023. Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, was the first US president since Jimmy Carter not to visit China during his term, according to the publication. Trump and Xi last spoke in January, just before Trump's inauguration. Bloomberg reports that the visit is necessary given the growing trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world. Trump has been engaged in a trade war with China, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is defending itself in the face of an internal economic crisis, trying to save as much as possible from the global trade system that saved China from poverty. Meanwhile, Trump aims to restructure the trade system, which he believes has benefited the rest of the world - and most of all, China - at the expense of the US. China has criticized Trump's policy towards Europe, with China's special envoy to European affairs, Lou Xiaoli, saying that he is shocked by Trump's behavior towards partners, calling it arrogant and dominant, and noting that the fate of a peace agreement for Ukraine cannot be determined solely by Washington and Moscow.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u041d\u0406\u0410\u041d](https://www.unian.net/world/tramp-prezident-ssha-anonsiroval-svoyu-vstrechu-s-si-czinpinom-12948798.html)\n\n**Xi Jinping to visit US 'soon,' Trump hints amid tariff disputes**\nPresident Donald Trump announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States 'soon,' without providing further details.

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agreed that while there have been strong diplomatic signals and mutual invitations between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, as well as substantial political incentives linked to finalizing a US-China trade deal, the probability of Trump physically visiting China before July 1, 2025, remains low. Key arguments across expert perspectives emphasized the severe logistical, security, and protocol constraints required for a high-profile presidential visit\u2014arrangements that historically require weeks or months, not just the 2-week window currently available. The base rate for short-notice US presidential visits to China is extremely low, with all forecasters noting no evidence (such as official announcements or logistical leaks) that preparations for such a visit are underway. Some forecasters acknowledged that Trump's appetite for dramatic, surprise summitry marginally increases the probability, but this was not sufficient to outweigh institutional, logistical, and political hurdles. The possibility of a last-minute breakthrough driven by urgent deal-making or symbolic motives is noted, but experts collectively judged such a scenario as highly improbable. Assigned probabilities for the visit mostly ranged between 3% and 20%, with one notably higher outlier at 72% based on exceptional incentive and potential for rapid diplomatic action. However, the consensus median and modal forecast is solidly in the low double digits or single digits. In summary: mutual incentives and positive signaling are not enough to overcome the logistical realities barring a Trump visit to China before the July 1 deadline, making a successful visit highly unlikely within the remaining time frame."
