For every day of June 2025 with an MLB game played, at least one relevant market is posted before the day ends and there are no regulatory interruptions.",

The platform has considerable financial and political backing, and the current federal regulatory environment under Trump is relatively favorable. However, ongoing state opposition is intensifying (e.g., NRA intervention in Nevada, NBA and MLB vocalizing concerns, Illinois sending cease-and-desist orders), and there is a credible risk of an emergency legal event\u2014such as a temporary injunction or sudden CFTC policy shift\u2014triggered by mounting criticism, especially over compliance shortcomings or consumer risk. Concretely, offering daily markets for every single day in June is difficult for any challenger platform under aggressive regulatory fire, since the barrier is absolute (a single-day interruption resolves this as No). I assign a base estimate of 60% given Kalshi\u2019s recent track record, but subtract for the real chance of sudden legal interruption typical in compliance-driven industries, then add back for the Trump administration/CFTC\u2019s permissive posture. Factoring in all angles and the fact that Kalshi is operational as of May 31, 2025, I forecast this outcome at 67%\u2014leaning Yes, but allowing a significant (one in three) chance that a court or regulator causes a temporary suspension for at least one day.",

However, the risk that a court, regulator, or Kalshi\u2019s legal department precipitates even a single-day halt remains real, especially if anti-Kalshi factions obtain a new injunction or if a technical or legal misstep (e.g., position limits, complaints about underage betting) occurs. Historically, federal litigation over gaming and jurisdiction rarely produces sudden nationwide shutdowns unless severe fraud or criminality is found, which is not evident here. Operational risk is more likely than sudden regulatory defeat in June 2025. Accordingly, while the balance of probabilities is on continued operation, the fragility of a 'perfect' 30/30 daily record means the risk of a NO event is non-trivial, though less than 30%.

On the other hand, the 40% from SportsManagementEventManagement is too bearish and not supported by recent legal momentum and Kalshi's risk posture.

The consensus among the most sophisticated forecasters (especially in regulatory, compliance, and market structure) leans toward a high, but distinctly sub-90%, probability, largely because the 'single gap means No' scoring makes tail risks more impactful. There are credible scenarios for sudden interruptions (e.g., emergency injunction, operational fail, liquidity disruption) that are not fully captured in economic incentives or legal status quo arguments. Conversely, some hyper-bullish takes (>90%) appear too complacent about litigation and enforcement volatility. My prior logic holds, but the group exchange suggests a modest downward nudge: a bit more humility about unforeseen risk is warranted given active, high-profile litigation and the all-or-nothing nature of the question.",

Critiques of both lower and extremely high forecasts highlighted the continued operational reality: federally regulated prediction markets almost never suffer immediate shutdowns from ongoing litigation, and the current protective posture (federal injunctions, CFTC inertia, Trump-era deregulatory atmosphere) is likely to persist across a 30-day window. The most persuasive critiques re-emphasized that tail risks (surprise injunctions, technical halts) remain non-zero but are overstated by bearish forecasters who seem to misread the sluggish pace of U.S. administrative law and overreact to theoretical compliance paralysis. The group consensus supports\u2014if anything\u2014a slight nudge upward, particularly as no new litigation or enforcement events are on the May/June docket, and Kalshi continues to withstand escalating state attacks.

Legal and regulatory proceedings, skeptical as they may be, are highly unlikely to trigger the sudden, out-of-the-blue suspension needed for a 'No' outcome, given Kalshi's recent track record of fighting off injunctions and the inertia at both judicial and regulatory levels. The exchange operations perspective reiterates how even under state sabre-rattling, actual daily service halts are rare, with status quo preservation being the overwhelming base case in these situations. That said, operational/technical disruption risk\u2014even if low\u2014remains present, so a perfect '90%+' confidence remains hard to justify.

Aggressive forecasters (90%+) seem a bit reckless, but the mid-to-high 80s forecasts are defensible. The strongest critiques against taking a lower number are: there are no imminent legal or regulatory tripwires (as reflected in the absence of a scheduled hearing or clear CFTC threat in June), and base rates from similar platforms (PredictIt, Polymarket) show rare short-term operational halts, even under legal siege. Consensus is that process-driven disruptions tend to be signaled well in advance, not dropped arbitrarily, so the probability of a single-day outage in June is moderate but somewhat lower than I initially accounted for. While I still stand by factoring in the one-and-done nature of the resolution criteria and the real (though declining) chance of a legal/operational 'lightning strike', the risk is overweighed in my initial estimate.

However, critique of my Phase 1 position failed to seriously grapple with the all-or-nothing nature of the event (a single missed day is enough for 'No'), ongoing and escalating regulatory/judicial contestation (with explicit mention of 'fast-moving' court action), and precedent for abrupt interruptions in similarly high-profile, gray-zone betting platforms. The ultra-high 90%+ forecasts dismiss fat-tail legal risk, and the 60-80% range still seems optimistic given the litigation signals and political climate, but my 40% looks overly conservative in light of (a) the short, critical window and (b) Kalshi\u2019s clear operational momentum.

The NRA believes it has a vested interest in the case, as Nevada's sports-betting industry took $7.8 billion in sports bets in 2024 and the NRA represents 70 casino resorts statewide. The NRA is concerned that Kalshi's prediction market is functionally identical to sports betting and that it does not have the experience to restrict underage participants or address compulsive gambling disorders. Kalshi argues that it is regulated by a federal commission and can offer its market in states that don't have any form of legal sports betting. Sports gambling legal expert I. Nelson Rose believes there's a place for prediction markets, as they have led to accurate forecasts. However, the case also involves political elements, including the appointment of a new head of the CFTC who was a member of Kalshi's board.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/judge-says-hell-move-quickly-on-kalshi-prediction-market-case-3374672/)\n\n**NBA Sounds Alarm on Sports Prediction Markets**\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) has expressed concerns about sports prediction markets like Kalshi, which offer contracts based on game outcomes without the same regulatory oversight as traditional sportsbooks. The league warns that these markets pose 'substantial integrity risks' to basketball, citing a lack of robust safeguards and the potential for game-fixing. The NBA emphasizes that protecting the integrity of the game is its top priority and is calling for a role in shaping regulatory standards for sports prediction markets. The league is particularly concerned about the rapid expansion of available contracts and the lack of age verification and geo-blocking technology in these markets. According to industry data, sports contracts now account for 78% of Kalshi's weekend trading volume, with NBA and MLB contracts significantly outperforming any non-sports markets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 05, 2025 05:10 PM\nSource:[bettorsinsider.com](https://www.bettorsinsider.com/news/2025/05/05/nba-sounds-alarm-on-sports-prediction-markets)\n\n**Prediction markets, odd alliances and a backdoor to legal sportsbooks**\nThe US Supreme Court's 2018 decision to legalize sports gambling has led to a new front in the industry's nationwide turf war: event-based prediction markets. These platforms, like Kalshi and Polymarket, offer futures contracts on various positions, from sports to politics, and are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, some states have issued cease-and-desist orders, and critics argue that these markets are a 'backdoor' to legalizing sports gambling without necessary safeguards. The Campaign for Fairer Gambling (CFG), led by Derek Webb, has endorsed prediction markets, citing their potential to squash the black market and protect consumers. However, some industry insiders question Webb's motives, given the CFG's efforts to combat addiction and the fact that prediction markets are open to anyone over 17. The CFTC is set to hold a roundtable on the subject, and President Trump's nominee for CFTC chair, Brian Quintenz, has ties to Kalshi. Major League Baseball has expressed concerns about the risks of sports prediction markets, and the outcome of this conflict may play out in the courts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 22, 2025 04:33 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14624131/Prediction-Markets-gambling-sports-legal.html)\n\n**Kalshi Secures Legal Victory in Nevada Gambling Dispute**\nKalshi, a predictive market, has secured a partial legal victory in its dispute with Nevada. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Nevada Gaming Control Board, allowing Kalshi to continue offering sports-related event contracts in Nevada. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour stated, 'If the CFTC tells us to stop, we will absolutely stop, but if they don't, then we won't.' Kalshi claims it is not required to follow state-by-state gambling regulations or taxation laws due to being a federally regulated platform. The company has introduced single-game betting markets for the NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments and partnered with Robinhood to launch a prediction market hub for its 25 million users.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 10, 2025 10:18 AM\nSource:[casinobeats.com](https://casinobeats.com/2025/04/10/kalshi-secures-legal-victory-in-nevada-gambling-dispute/)\n\n**Kalshi\u2019s Nevada Legal Win Fuels Prediction Market Debate**\nKalshi, a prediction market platform, has won a significant legal battle in Nevada, with a federal judge ruling that the company can continue operating its sports event contracts in the state while its legal battle with Nevada regulators plays out. This decision is a major victory for Kalshi, but it also highlights the broader debate between federal oversight and state gambling laws. Kalshi's CEO, Mansour, said, 'Prediction markets are a 21st-century innovation, and like all innovations, they\u2019re misunderstood at first.' The company is fighting back against state regulators, claiming they are overstepping their authority. A win in Nevada could set a precedent that weakens other states' cases, and the CFTC's changing stance on prediction markets is also a factor in the debate. While the CFTC has closed an investigation into Kalshi's Super Bowl-themed contracts without penalties, the company still needs to register as a designated contract market (DCM) and comply with rules like position limits and anti-manipulation safeguards. Critics argue that these requirements are too lax compared to state gaming licenses, which involve rigorous background checks and revenue-sharing agreements with tribes or casinos.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 10, 2025 08:12 AM\nSource:[insidebitcoins.com](https://insidebitcoins.com/news/kalshis-nevada-legal-win-fuels-prediction-market-debate)\n\n**Prediction Market Kalshi Will Win Battle with Nevada: Crypto Attorney**\nKalshi, a prediction market, is facing cease-and-desist orders from Nevada and New Jersey over its sports contracts, claiming they violate state gambling laws. However, crypto attorney Aaron Brogan believes Kalshi will win these cases, citing the Commodity Exchange Act and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's jurisdiction over derivative contracts. Brogan argues that prediction markets like Kalshi operate as neutral intermediaries, matching orders without taking a side, and that the outcomes of sports games are commodities that can serve a legitimate economic purpose as hedging instruments. A victory for Kalshi could transform American sports betting culture, allowing states to respond politically or legally, but ultimately presenting a landmark federalism dilemma: Can states retain traditional authority over gambling regulation, or will federal regulatory frameworks dominate in the digital age?\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 08:34 AM\nSource:[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/04/09/kalshi-will-win-its-battle-with-nevada-crypto-attorney)\n\n**Illinois Issues Cease and Desist Orders to Prediction Companies**\nThe Illinois Gaming Board has sent cease-and-desist orders to Kalshi, Robinhood, and Crypto.com, claiming that they are operating illegally without a sports betting license. The companies have been offering sports-event outcome contracts that act like wagers, which is in violation of Illinois law. Kalshi has been offering markets on individual NCAA tournament games, generating over $200 million in the first weekend of March Madness. Illinois is the latest state to take aim at prediction markets, following Ohio, Nevada, and New Jersey, which have also sent cease-and-desist orders to the companies. Kalshi has filed lawsuits against Nevada and New Jersey, arguing that it is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal regulator.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 02, 2025 02:45 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/illinois-issues-cease-and-desist-orders-to-prediction-companies-apr-2-2025)\n\n**Kalshi's sports predictions are under fire, and the whole gambling industry is watching**\nKalshi, a futures trading platform, and Robinhood, a fintech platform, are under fire from regulators in Nevada and New Jersey over their sports prediction markets. The regulators have sent cease-and-desist orders, but Kalshi's CEO, Tarek Mansour, says 'This time will be no different' and that the company has fought and won against similar challenges before. Kalshi argues that its sports contracts are legitimate and overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has the authority to approve or reject them. If Kalshi wins, it could 'trigger a significant reaction from the sports betting industry,' said James Kilsby, chief analyst at Vixio, a regulatory tech company. Sports predictions have surged in popularity since the 2024 US presidential election and could threaten revenue for states like Nevada and New Jersey, which have led the expansion of legal sports betting in the US.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 31, 2025 09:29 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/kalshis-sports-predictions-come-under-fire-amid-march-madness-trades-2025-3)\n\n**Gaming & Gambling Update - Week of March 24, 2025**\nKalshi's sports betting prediction market, in partnership with Robinhood, has seen significant success, reporting $249 million in contracts during the first two rounds of the NCAA College Basketball Tournament. Kalshi plans to introduce a 'consumer protection hub' for users to self-exclude and set deposit limits. However, the Nevada Gaming Control Board has sent a cease-and-desist order to Kalshi, alleging unlicensed sports betting in the state. Meanwhile, responsible gaming efforts are gaining attention, with the American Gaming Association estimating $3.1 billion will be wagered on the NCAA Tournament. State regulators and sportsbooks are enhancing responsible gambling initiatives, including campaigns from FanDuel and DraftKings. Some Members of Congress, including Congressman Michael Baumgartner, are seeking to ban collegiate player prop bets, while others, like Representative Paul Tonko, aim to ban all prop betting. Baumgartner's bill, the PROTECT Act, focuses on protecting amateur athletes from harassment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 28, 2025 04:17 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/gaming-gambling-update-week-of-march-24-5931706/)\n\n**A big threat to the gambling world was on full display at one of the industry's top conferences**\nThe US gambling industry is facing a threat from emerging formats like prediction markets, sweepstakes, and new daily fantasy models. These challenger brands are gaining traction and are regulated differently from sports betting and online gambling. Prediction markets, such as those offered by Crypto.com, Kalshi, and Polymarket, are legal in all 50 US states and are being reviewed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Chris Grove, cofounder and general partner of Acies Investments, said that prediction markets could 'upend' the dynamic between gambling operators and regulators. Grove also suggested that gambling operators could consider pushing into predictions, and that apps like Kalshi could evolve to offer full-game parlays, making them more like sports betting. AI, crypto gaming, M&A, and the impact of tariffs were also major themes at the Next.io's Next Summit in New York. Despite tensions and economic uncertainty, the broader outlook among gambling companies was relatively rosy, with investors predicting an uptick in M&A in the next 12 to 24 months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 20, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/online-gambling-conference-next-summit-takeaways-ai-predictions-sweepstakes-2025-3)\n\n**Nevada Issues Cease & Desist Letter to Kalshi**\nThe Nevada Gaming Control Board has issued a cease and desist letter to Kalshi, a financial exchange startup, ordering them to halt trading on sporting events and elections by March 14. According to the letter, Kalshi's actions are a 'direct violation of Nevada's public policy' as they allow users to buy and sell contracts for real-world events, which is prohibited in the state. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour stated, 'Kalshi will stay committed to our approach and keep paving the way for regulated prediction markets to thrive in the U.S.' The company has faced pressure from regulators, but has also received support from prominent figures such as President Donald Trump and CFTC chairman Brian Quintenz. The American Gaming Association and other industry groups have also expressed support for prediction markets. The move comes as sports betting's presence in the U.S. continues to grow, with 38 states and Washington D.C. now legally operative.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 10:27 AM\nSource:[casinobeats.com](https://casinobeats.com/2025/03/12/nevada-issues-cease-desist-letter-to-kalshi/)\n\n**Nevada Sends Cease-and-Desist Order to Kalshi**\nThe Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) has issued a cease-and-desist order to Kalshi, a prediction market platform, citing violations of state gaming laws. The order requires Kalshi to exit the market by March 14, 2025, and warns of potential criminal or civil penalties for non-compliance. NGCB Chairman Kirk Hendrick stated, 'Every sports pool in Nevada must undergo an extensive investigation prior to licensing, must adhere to strict regulation once licensed, and must pay all applicable taxes and fees.' Kalshi has expressed disappointment with the decision, but maintains respect for regulators and the regulatory process. This move comes after a letter from Nevada Congresswoman Dina Titus (D) raised concerns about legalizing prediction markets on sports contracts, arguing it could undermine state-regulated sports betting, consumer protections, and tax revenues. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will hold a public roundtable to discuss regulating prediction markets, including sports-related contracts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 07:59 PM\nSource:[Covers.com](https://www.covers.com/industry/nevada-sends-cease-and-desist-order-to-kalshi-march-5-2025)\n\n**Las Vegas Hits Back Against Kalshi's 'National' Sports Betting**\nNevada's gambling regulator has asked Kalshi Inc. to stop offering derivatives trading on professional and college sports to residents in the state by March 14. This move marks the first challenge to the rapid rise of sports-based 'event contracts' offered by federally-regulated exchanges like Kalshi and Crypto.com, as well as unregulated platforms including Polymarket.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 06:37 PM\nSource:[Bloomberg Business](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/las-vegas-hits-back-against-kalshi-s-national-sports-betting)\n\n",

    "summary": "The expert forecasts on whether Kalshi will offer markets on daily baseball games every day in June 2025 are generally positive but incorporate notable legal and operational risks. Most experts highlight that as of May 31, 2025, Kalshi is actively offering MLB markets, bolstered by recent preliminary legal victories (notably an injunction in Nevada) and a permissive federal regulatory (CFTC) environment under the Trump administration. These factors increase the probability of uninterrupted daily MLB markets through June. Experts agree Kalshi has strong business incentives, operational resilience, and is likely to maintain offerings unless forcibly halted.\n\nHowever, significant risks stem from ongoing and escalating legal challenges at the state level (Nevada, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio) and the possibility of emergency court injunctions or a sudden shift by the CFTC. The requirement that at least one MLB market be offered every single day in June 2025 makes even a brief disruption decisive in producing a 'No' outcome. Some experts also note the risk of technical or operational issues, albeit less prominently than legal risks.\n\nProbabilities assigned by the experts range from 40% (most pessimistic, stressing the fragility of continuous operation due to high legal uncertainty and the strict resolution standard) to 94% (most optimistic, emphasizing Kalshi\u2019s legal wins, federal preemption arguments, and slow-moving courts). The majority forecast a probability in the 70-90% range, with a central tendency around the low to mid-80s, stressing that the main threat is a sudden legal or regulatory intervention causing even a single missed day. Experts acknowledge that while Kalshi is well-positioned to continue operations through June, the ongoing legal tumult makes certainty elusive.\n\nIn summary, the consensus is that Kalshi is likely\u2014but not certain\u2014to offer MLB markets every day in June 2025, provided no unforeseen legal, regulatory, or technical event interrupts operations during this high-stakes month."
