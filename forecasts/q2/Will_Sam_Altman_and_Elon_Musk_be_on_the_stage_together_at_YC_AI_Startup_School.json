Musk's stated re-commitment to managing his companies, with major launches and internal crises expected in the days around the event, compounds risk of non-attendance or logistical dropout. While YC has enormous incentive to create such a 'moment,' there is no explicit confirmation of a joint appearance and both individuals' schedules/personalities and risk management requirements make spontaneous convergence unlikely. The only clear path to Yes is through extraordinary lobbying or a last-minute d\u00e9tente, for which there is mild but insufficient evidence. Using base rates from similar tech conferences: even with multiple top-tier speakers, joint appearances among rivals are rare unless pre-announced or driven by a shared product. Overall, the probability is markedly below even, but not negligible, as extraordinary events occasionally occur under pressure. Therefore, I assess the probability at 11%.",

Direct disputes, ongoing litigation, and historical avoidance of direct public encounters since their fallout suggest a joint appearance is more likely to be rumored than realized. The only plausible way this occurs is via a brief, carefully managed symbolic appearance, but this requires full buy-in from both sides, which is not strongly apparent in current signals.

Current news shows persistent, publicly aired disputes between Musk and Altman, including recent lawsuits and dueling AI platform launches. Musk is deprioritizing public events due to business crises at X and Tesla ('living at the office'), lowering the probability that he participates in any unscripted session. YC has not publicized any special joint-appearance format. While Altman has extended minor overtures, there is no reciprocal enthusiasm from Musk. There are no public statements indicating an intent to appear together, and base rates for joint rival appearances at US tech summits are below 10% barring explicit announcements.

Musk\u2019s pattern of skipping events when his businesses demand focus (ongoing crisis at X/Tesla/Starship) adds risk he will withdraw last-minute or only appear virtually. While Altman\u2019s olive branch marginally increases the odds of behind-the-scenes reconciliation, it is not enough to override deep institutional, personal, and event format factors. A \"No\" outcome aligns with executive culture: risk aversion to unscripted joint public appearances, especially when both control multi-billion-dollar reputations and PR narratives.

Furthermore, in the present media climate, a staged 'unity' would require overt, rehearsed framing, not backroom hopes. No signal from either party (or YC) that such drama is in the works.

The consensus highlights: bitter public disputes almost never translate into headline joint appearances without explicit reconciliation or pre-announced format, operational/logistical crises on Musk's side are dominant, and contemporary Silicon Valley risk-averseness in executive culture is near-absolute in this kind of rivalry. While my critique of the lowest single-digit probabilities still stands (occasional shock headline moments have precedent), the structural, operational, and scheduling barriers are simply too large to justify staying above a 20% threshold. The true likelihood is best reflected by the modal cluster of peer predictions (7-18%), and I now judge my earlier optimism to undervalue deep-seated structural ongoing animosity and the lack of any public script or PR buildup. My revised estimate narrows to 15%, aligning with a base of rare but possible symbolic stunts, but no more.",

While some forecasters advocate for a substantially lower probability (single digits), mainly citing catastrophic levels of rivalry and logistical incompatibility, several (including myself) appropriately weigh the rare but real incentives for a headline-grabbing moment at a YC event of this stature. The repeated, excessive enthusiasm around 'network ties' and 'institutional prestige' has been shown\u2014across several critiques\u2014to lack robust empirical support in the face of active litigation, public grudges, and operational constraints, especially for Musk. The highest defensible arguments for raising probability (event spectacle, olive-branch rhetoric) still do not rise to the level of overpowering the strong base rate against such joint stage moments. Conversely, the scenario is not a pure black swan; a minor chance of performative, last-minute symbolic appearance remains. Therefore, the original 18% is on the high-but-justifiable edge, reflecting all plausible weighings. There is no new argument that credibly justifies a revision up or down based on news or debate; thus, I keep my estimate unchanged.",

Repeated critiques of any probability materially above 20% point to the minimal explanatory power of prestige, weak signals, or event magnitude alone when set against the ongoing, widely-acknowledged Altman-Musk antagonism, Musk's operational overload, and lack of any confirmed or publicized joint format. The only slight upward pressure comes from several acknowledgments that a dramatic, last-minute power play or orchestrated 'Unity Moment' is possible in this ego-driven ecosystem, but group consensus (including my own Media Events Model lens) holds that this is the exception, not the rule. No new information or argument from peer deliberation compels a move in either direction\u2014if anything, the critiques of higher probabilities based on vague network optimism encourage holding firm or even shading downward.

Ive, the design visionary behind Apple's most beloved products, is teaming up with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a partnership that could reshape the future of consumer technology. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI has agreed to acquire Ive's company, LoveFrom, for nearly $6.5 billion. As part of the agreement, Ive will oversee the design of new hardware devices being developed by OpenAI, drawing clear lines between his future work and his storied past at Apple. This development raises serious questions about Apple's direction and ability to lead in the age of artificial intelligence, particularly given its recent struggles and slow pace of innovation. Apple's progress in artificial intelligence has noticeably lagged behind competitors, and the company is facing an ongoing exodus of engineering talent and key personnel. The implications for Apple are stark, with OpenAI potentially positioning itself as a serious contender in the consumer device market. Apple's upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 9 will be closely watched, but insiders caution against anticipating major breakthroughs in AI.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 08:54 PM\nSource:[PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/cpi-posts/apple-faces-uncertain-future-as-jony-ive-joins-forces-with-openai/)\n\n**Elon Musk Returns to Office, Vows to Focus on Improving Companies**\nAfter a major outage on the X social network, Elon Musk announced that he will start sleeping in the office again and focus on improving his companies.

Anderson will step down as the head of the conference in 2027, and the event will return to its roots in California. The conference has been a platform for discussing a wide range of topics, including technology, humanism, and climate change, and has featured speakers such as Elon Musk and Pope Francis. However, the conference has also faced criticism for its lack of diversity and its failure to address the negative consequences of technological advancements.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 14, 2025 12:29 PM\nSource:[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/ted-25-sam-altman-vancouver-li.3251760)\n\n**Altman Extends Olive Branch to Musk: Let's Work Together on AGI**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has hinted at a willingness to collaborate with Elon Musk, putting aside their past disagreements to work together on achieving General Artificial Intelligence (AGI). The two were involved in a Twitter spat over the weekend, with Musk referencing a tweet by Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham that said, 'Few people have done more to beat Trump than Sam Altman.' Altman responded, 'We were all wrong, at least I was wrong. But that was 2016, this is 2022.' Altman was referring to a new article that quoted a 2022 tweet by Musk, which said, 'I don't hate this guy (Trump), but Trump is ready to hang up his hat and ride off into the sunset.' Altman then extended an olive branch to Musk, saying, 'Anyway, see you next week, let's be friends, AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.' It's worth noting that Musk has been a close ally of Trump and was appointed as the head of the Department of Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, Altman has also aligned himself with the US government's agenda, participating in the $5 trillion 'Stargate' project, which aims to build AI infrastructure. Despite Musk's criticism of OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft, Altman has hinted at a willingness to collaborate with Musk on AGI.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 10, 2025 11:41 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/usstock/c/2025-05-10/doc-inewarnv7447955.shtml)\n\n**Sam Altman's Investments: A Look at His Portfolio and Relationship with OpenAI**\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has been a prominent figure in the AI boom.

According to data from TRAC, a venture-capital firm, they have a high success rate in identifying promising startups at an early stage. TRAC's methodology uses quantitative metrics to identify consistent talent scouts, including return on investment and follow-on fundraising. The firm has identified an elite group of 250 early-stage investors who generate supersized returns, including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Marc Andreessen. Jessica Livingston, co-founder of Y Combinator, is one of the few female early-stage investors among the 250, with a 31% return on her 13 early-stage investments. TRAC's data suggest that investing alongside these superstars can be a strong predictor of a startup's success.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 11:16 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/best-startup-investors-silicon-valley-sam-altman-startup-investments-david-sacks-venture-capital-silicon-valley-11741172795247.html)\n\n**The Rise of Sam Altman: From Loopt to OpenAI and a Net Worth of $1.1 Billion**\nSam Altman, the creator of Chat GPT, developed an invention that is used by everyone and became one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the world. His story began in 2005 when he founded 'Loopt', a location-sharing app that received backing from 'Y Combinator', opening doors in Silicon Valley. During his time at YC, he pushed forward revolutionary initiatives like Airbnb and Dropbox. He later co-founded OpenAI with Elon Musk, betting on artificial intelligence as a driver of change. His strategy and vision allowed him to accumulate a significant fortune through investments in Stripe, Reddit, and Helion. Altman's leadership at Y Combinator solidified his reputation in the digital ecosystem. Each step in his career reinforces his position as one of the leading financial figures in the tech sector, serving as an example for new entrepreneurs. Altman emphasizes that achieving goals is based on three key pillars: identifying priorities, eliminating distractions, and organizing activities through lists. He also stresses the importance of focusing on motivating projects and delegating less appealing tasks to collaborators. He recommends writing down his lists on paper, which helps with organization and allows for flexible adjustments to priorities. This method contributes to maintaining concentration and managing multiple responsibilities without burnout. Currently, the OpenAI CEO has a net worth of $1.1 billion, ranking him 2598th globally.

Musk announced the launch of 'Grok 3' on his platform 'X', stating that it will be revealed during a live presentation on Monday at 8:00 PM Pacific Time (8:00 AM UAE time on Tuesday). Musk described the new model as 'the smartest on Earth', and assured that the team will continue to develop it until its launch. Musk previously stated that 'Grok 3' was in its final stages of development and would be available within a week or two, sparking widespread anticipation in the technology and AI world. During his participation in the 'Global Governments Summit' in Dubai, Musk described 'Grok 3' as surpassing all previous models, to the point where it 'seems terrifying at times' due to its advanced intelligence. Musk also spoke about his vision for the future of AI, highlighting the challenges it faces, including his ongoing feud with his former partner Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which he co-founded in 2015. Musk said, 'The goal of OpenAI was to be an open-source, non-profit company, but now they are only focused on maximizing profits from AI... They are pursuing money in an unprecedented way.' This escalation comes amid an ongoing feud between Musk and Altman over OpenAI's direction, with Altman seeking to convert it into a for-profit company, which Musk strongly opposes, considering it violates the principles on which the company was founded.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 09:36 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/mask-grok3-compete-chatgpt)\n\n**Musk Announces Release of 'Smartest AI on Earth' with Grok 3**\nElon Musk announced the release of the new neural network Grok 3 from his startup xAI. According to Musk, the release will take place next week. He stated that this will be 'the smartest AI on earth'. Last year, Musk claimed that new AI models would surpass human intelligence by the end of 2025. He also predicted that the capabilities of general artificial intelligence (AGI) will surpass those of all humans within the next five years. Musk launched xAI in 2023, aiming to create an 'AI maximally oriented to searching for truth'. He previously co-founded OpenAI but left in 2018 due to disagreements. In March 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, accusing the company of violating its obligations to safely create AI due to its partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI denied the allegations and published excerpts from their correspondence with Musk, showing that he asked to be given control over the company and proposed merging it with Tesla. xAI presented the chatbot Grok in November 2023, stating that it is designed to answer almost any question and even suggest what questions to ask. In August 2024, the startup released Grok 2, which was ranked among the top five best chatbots in the world by independent testing sites, alongside ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. In February, Musk's consortium of investors offered $97.4 billion to purchase the non-profit organization controlling OpenAI, developer of the chatbot ChatGPT. Musk's lawyer Mark Tobeyroff filed a corresponding application to the OpenAI board of directors. After this, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X: 'No thanks, but we'll buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 01:42 PM\nSource:[Forbes.ru](https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/530947-mask-anonsiroval-reliz-samogo-umnogo-ii-na-zemle)\n\n**Musk-Altman, the Duel for the Throne of AI**\nIn 2015, Sam Altman, then 28 years old and head of Y Combinator, a venture capital firm, invited Elon Musk to dinner at the Rosewood Hotel in Palo Alto, California.

    "summary": "Forecasts from experts across fields converge on a low probability that Sam Altman and Elon Musk will share a physical stage at YC AI Startup School. The dominant reasoning is that while both are highly incentivized speakers for YC\u2014offering prestige and publicity for the event\u2014their ongoing public and legal rivalry, recent lawsuits, and history of competitive posturing create strong disincentives for a joint appearance. Experts highlight Musk's unpredictable schedule and pressing company crises (e.g., 'wartime mode', Starship launch, X outages), which make even his solo attendance uncertain and greatly reduce the odds of a coordinated, high-profile joint session. Although there are modest signs of reconciliation (Altman's publicly extended 'olive branch') and organizational incentives (YC's interest in a symbolic, newsworthy moment), these are consistently judged insufficient to overcome entrenched conflict, reputational risk, and scheduling hurdles; base rates for rival tech executives sharing a stage, especially amid active conflict, are cited as very low. Scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome typically require extraordinary last-minute negotiation or a calculated publicity stunt, neither of which are currently signaled by event PR or public statements. The most plausible scenario remains separate keynotes or sessions, or potentially a remote (virtual) appearance by one or both. Probability estimates cluster between 7% and 22%, with a weighted average around 14%, reflecting collective expert skepticism but acknowledging a nonzero chance of a symbolic reconciliation orchestrated by YC. In summary, joint stage appearance is not impossible, but remains unlikely without new, explicit developments."
