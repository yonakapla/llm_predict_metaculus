The lack of transparent judicial proceedings, the exclusion of Chadema from elections, and reports of opposition figures being held on vague or technical grounds decrease the likelihood of a prompt release. While precedent for release under pressure exists, it is mostly for international figures or those with powerful external advocates, not for local leaders in the epicenter of the regime's focus. Therefore, the base rate for rapid release of such figures in this environment is low; unless there is a sudden, unanticipated surge in pressure (public protest, major diplomatic threat, regime calculation of risk reversal), Golugwa is likely to remain in custody through the resolution window.",

The only recent rapid releases involved foreign nationals subjected to diplomatic lobbying and 'deportation' rather than genuine legal proceedings. The current legal justification for Golugwa's detention is weak and could theoretically support a quick administrative release, but the larger context \u2013 a crackdown on opposition, CHADEMA\u2019s exclusion from the election, and growing repression \u2013 strongly suggests political rather than procedural motives, increasing the probability that he will not be released by the resolution deadline. Unless there is a rapid, unforeseen shift in either domestic/foreign pressure or internal calculations of political risk, extended detention is the path of least resistance for authorities. However, I allow for a small probability of a face-saving release if legal process norms are invoked or diplomatic efforts ramp up. Accordingly, I set the probability at 10%.",

The recent release of foreign activists after mistreatment/deportation, under international pressure, shows that external pressure can yield results but has much less precedent for high-profile domestic opposition leaders. Instead, the fate of figures like Tundu Lissu (arrested, charged with treason, not released) and the intensifying crackdown (CHADEMA party exclusion, successive arrests) point to a strong state incentive to keep Golugwa detained at least through the June 15 window, to prevent organizing or media engagement ahead of the October election. While there is some international pressure (statements from the IDU, foreign media), there has been no sign this altered the authorities' calculus on high-value detainees. Given these factors, the likelihood Golugwa will be released before June 15 is low \u2014 unless there is a sudden shift (e.g., international mediation, or a government PR move) not present in current reporting. My estimate is anchored on the base rate of extended pretrial detention for Tanzanian opposition figures, moderately updated to account for the rising profile of his arrest and modest, but insufficient, international advocacy.",

The base rate for prompt release of domestic political opposition leaders in Tanzania in the past 2\u20133 years is very low, especially in the 30-day period immediately after a pre-election arrest. The only probable mechanisms for Golugwa\u2019s near-term release would involve a dramatic increase in international pressure or a calculated gesture by the regime to shift narratives\u2014neither of which appears imminent given the coverage and government statements so far. Small upticks in probability due to recent releases of foreign activists, but in comparative experience, local opposition leaders face much harsher treatment and longer detentions, especially when the charges are vague and the arrest is politically timed.

My original estimate of 7% is perhaps marginally more pessimistic than the group mean, but still well-justified, given that in this particular instance, the regime has every incentive to keep Golugwa in detention through June 15 to prevent opposition mobilization and signal dominance. Therefore, although I acknowledge the group's modestly higher mean (10-15%), the marginal probability of a sudden release based on current reporting does not warrant a significant upward revision. I will adjust my probability slightly upward\u2014reflecting group consensus, and to avoid overconfidence\u2014setting the revised probability at 10%.",

He was sentenced to life in prison in 2022 for selling passports in an affair. His supporters claim that the trial was political, while the authorities say that no pardon can be considered without the request of the interested party. Sambi's camp continues to claim his innocence. On May 18, 2025, the Juwa party, founded by the former President, gathered opposition figures and supporters to demand Sambi's release. The party's lawyer, Ma\u00eetre Mahamoudou Ahamada, participated in the ceremony, denouncing 'an injustice, manifest abuses and a relentless pursuit' against the former President. The authorities have made it clear that a pardon can only be considered if the interested party makes the request. Houmed Msaidi\u00e9, political advisor to President Azali Assoumani, recalled that Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi has expressed neither remorse nor apologies. There is also a parliamentary report on this case. Sambi was sentenced to life in prison by the State Security Court, which offers no appeal, after boycotting the trial. The case concerns the management of the economic citizenship program, which allowed stateless people from Gulf countries to obtain a Comorian passport. Seven years after Sambi's arrest, the case remains a sensitive issue in Comorian public opinion, especially during a politically charged time, as the country will celebrate its 50th anniversary of independence in July.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 03:02 PM\nSource:[allAfrica.fr](https://fr.allafrica.com/stories/202505260454.html)\n\n**Ugandan Activist Claims Torture and Abuse by Tanzanian Security Forces**\nUgandan human rights activist Agather Atuhaire claims she was subjected to physical and sexual abuse, including being beaten, raped, and smeared with feces, while detained by Tanzanian security forces.

Atuhaire, a human rights activist, was arrested on May 19, 2025, in Dar-es-Salaam, the economic capital of Tanzania, along with Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi, who was supporting opposition leader Tundu Lissu. Lissu was appearing in court on charges of treason, which carries the death penalty. The opposition and several NGOs expressed concern about the repression of opposition in Uganda and Tanzania ahead of presidential elections scheduled for 2026 and 2027. Atuhaire 'was abandoned at the border by Tanzanian authorities' and taken care of by her family and friends, according to the Ugandan human rights organization 'Agora Discourse'. 'She presents signs of torture,' emphasized AFP's Spire Ssentongo, co-founder of the organization. Mwangi, who was also arrested, was found on Thursday, May 22, 2025, near the Kenyan border, according to human rights defenders. 'We have both been treated worse than dogs: chained, blindfolded, and subjected to atrocious torture,' Mwangi said in an interview upon his return to Nairobi. Several observers, including Kenyan presidential candidate Martha Karua and a former Kenyan Supreme Court president, were denied entry into Tanzania on Sunday and Monday. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan asked her security forces to ban 'foreign activists' who try to 'meddle in our affairs' on Monday. The Ugandan opposition and human rights NGOs denounced the political repression by the executive, accusing it of returning to the authoritarian practices of its predecessor, John Magufuli (in power from 2015 to 2021). 'Generalized transborder intimidation' is the term used by these groups to describe the recent incidents of cross-border kidnappings, illegal detentions, and illegal repatriations that have led to false accusations against the victims. 'We have engaged in diplomatic negotiations, and that's how it happens,' said Kenyan Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi, who was criticized for his government's inaction. 'We (Mwangi and Atuhaire) have been treated worse than dogs, chained, blindfolded, and subjected to truly horrible torture,' Mwangi detailed upon his return to Nairobi in the evening of May 22. Addressing the press in front of a Nairobi airport, he said that both were 'handcuffed and blindfolded' since Monday. 'The situation in Tanzania is very bad, I think what happened to us is what happens to all Tanzanian activists,' he denounced. Earlier, his wife Njeri Mwangi had told AFP that she was 'with him and he is alive, but injured.' Ugandan diplomat Fred Mwesigye, high commissioner for Tanzania, had told AFP that he had contacted Tanzanian authorities to ask about Atuhaire's situation and discuss her 'possibilities of release,' and had received no response from the Tanzanian government. This was before Atuhaire's release on May 23, 2025.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 04:51 PM\nSource:[afriquinfos.com](https://afriquinfos.com/tanzanie-ouganda-confidences-autour-des-liberations-dagather-atuhaire-et-de-boniface-mwangi/)\n\n**Activists Detained in Guinea-Bissau Released**\nActivists detained by police in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau on Sunday were released on Monday night, according to the Frente Popular. The organization, along with the 'Po de Terra' movement, had called for a protest that did not take place, but some individuals were detained. The Frente Popular announced on social media that the detainees were released, confirming that there were four detained, after initially stating that there were six and the Guinean police confirming three. One of the detainees, who will be hospitalized, 'will be discharged tomorrow' (Tuesday), without specifying the reason for the hospitalization. The organizers of the protest had announced that they would 'surprise the regime' and did not disclose any details about the initiative, which was symbolically scheduled for Africa Day, May 25. The protest was scheduled for early morning hours, but only the usual police apparatus was visible, without the presence of protesters. Since President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 dissolved the parliament in December 2023, there have been at least ten failed attempts at protests in Guinea-Bissau. The calls for these actions began with the PAI-Terra Ranka coalition, which was removed from the government after the dissolution of the National People's Assembly in December 2023, six months after taking office and without having completed the 12 months required by the Constitution, since the date of the elections. The head of state claims to have used a constitutional extension that allows him to assess whether there are conditions for governability and concluded that there were not. Embal\u00f3 considered that the parliament was negotiating with alleged acts of corruption by the majority government coalition led by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). The President of the Republic replaced the executive with a presidential initiative and the president of the Assembly, Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira, leader of PAI-Terra Ranka and PAIGC, with Adja Satu Camar\u00e1, Madem G15, a party founded by the head of state. PAI-Terra Ranka began calling for protests in January 2024, and the Frente Popular emerged later with similar initiatives, all of which were unsuccessful. The opposition's request for a general strike in the country when Embal\u00f3 completed five years in office, on February 27, without calling elections, also had the same result. The promoters of the protests attribute the lack of participation to intimidation and repression by the police and military apparatus and the use of tear gas in some cases. The head of state has, however, called for early general, presidential, and legislative elections on November 23, 2025.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 26, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[RTP - R\u00e1dio Televis\u00e3o Portuguesa](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/libertados-ativistas-detidos-na-guine-bissau_n1657752)\n\n**Comoros: Passe d'armes between authorities and supporters of former President Sambi**\nAhmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi, the former President of the Comoros from 2006 to 2011, has been in detention for his eighth year, since May 18, 2025.

Atuhaire 'was abandoned at the border by Tanzanian authorities' and taken care of by her family and friends, according to the Ugandan human rights organization 'Agora Discourse'. 'She presents signs of torture,' emphasized AFP's Spire Ssentongo, co-founder of the organization. Mwangi, who was also arrested, was found on Thursday, May 22, 2025, near the Kenyan border, according to human rights defenders. 'We have both been treated worse than dogs: chained, blindfolded, and subjected to atrocious torture,' Mwangi said in an interview upon his return to Nairobi. Several observers, including Kenyan presidential candidate Martha Karua and a former Kenyan Supreme Court president, were denied entry into Tanzania on Sunday and Monday. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan asked her security forces to ban 'foreign activists' who try to 'meddle in our affairs' on Monday. The Ugandan opposition and human rights NGOs denounced the political repression by the executive, accusing it of returning to the authoritarian practices of its predecessor, John Magufuli (in power from 2015 to 2021). 'Generalized transborder intimidation' is the term used by these groups to describe the recent incidents of cross-border kidnappings, illegal detentions, and illegal repatriations that have led to false accusations against the victims. 'We have engaged in diplomatic negotiations, and that's how it happens,' said Kenyan Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi, who was criticized for his government's inaction. 'We (Mwangi and Atuhaire) have been treated worse than dogs, chained, blindfolded, and subjected to truly horrible torture,' Mwangi detailed upon his return to Nairobi in the evening of May 22. Addressing the press in front of a Nairobi airport, he said that both were 'handcuffed and blindfolded' since Monday. 'The situation in Tanzania is very bad, I think what happened to us is what happens to all Tanzanian activists,' he denounced. Earlier, his wife Njeri Mwangi had told AFP that she was 'with him and he is alive, but injured.' Ugandan diplomat Fred Mwesigye, high commissioner for Tanzania, had told AFP that he had contacted Tanzanian authorities to ask about Atuhaire's situation and discuss her 'possibilities of release,' and had received no response from the Tanzanian government. This was before Atuhaire's release on May 23, 2025.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 04:51 PM\nSource:[afriquinfos.com](https://afriquinfos.com/tanzanie-ouganda-confidences-autour-des-liberations-dagather-atuhaire-et-de-boniface-mwangi/)\n\n**Kenyan rights activists denied entry to Tanzania for opposition leader's trial**\nSeveral Kenyan rights activists, including former Justice Minister Martha Karua, were denied entry to Tanzania over the weekend to attend the treason trial of opposition leader Tundu Lissu. Karua and at least two others were detained at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Nairobi. Lissu, who was shot 16 times in 2017, was charged with treason over a speech calling for public rebellion and election disruption. Karua said, 'The state can not be used as a personal tool. You can not deport people whom you don't like, who are not aligned to your views.'

The three traveled to Tanzania to observe the preliminary hearing of Tundu Lissu, the president of the main opposition party in Tanzania, Chadema. Khalid explained in a video that their passports were retained at the Julius Nyerere International Airport, where they remain detained. The Kenyan government's principal secretary for Foreign Affairs, Korir Sing'Oei, urged the Tanzanian authorities to release Mutunga and his delegation according to the laws of the East African Community (EAC). This incident occurred hours after Tanzanian authorities denied entry to opposition leader and lawyer Martha Karua, who was detained at the Dar es Salam airport along with two other Kenyan lawyers and human rights defenders. Karua and her colleagues were scheduled to participate in Lissu's defense, who is being tried for treason and publishing false information, charges that can carry the death penalty in Tanzania. Lissu, who was elected president of Chadema in January, had threatened to go on hunger strike if he was not allowed to attend the trial in person, instead of virtually as initially planned. Human rights groups and opposition sectors have denounced a wave of repression and detentions of dissidents in Tanzania over the past year, despite President Samia Suluhu Hassan's initial reforms to counter the severe restrictions on freedom of expression imposed by her predecessor, John Magufuli. These actions against the opposition have raised concerns among NGOs and the opposition about a return to Magufuli's repressive policies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 08:43 AM\nSource:[SWI swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/tanzania-impide-entrar-al-pa%C3%ADs-y-retiene-a-un-expresidente-del-poder-judicial-keniano/89343495)\n\n**Rights group slams Tanzania over detention of Karua and two others**\nThe Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC) has condemned the arrest and detention of Martha Karua, Gloria Kimani, and Lynn Ngugi at Julius Nyerere International Airport, calling it an unlawful act that violates regional and international human rights standards. The three were detained on Saturday morning upon arrival in Dar es Salaam, where they were scheduled to observe treason proceedings against opposition leader Tundu Lissu. Karua, the People's Liberation Party leader and former presidential candidate, said immigration officials denied her entry without explanation, citing 'fear in this government of our dear Mama Suluhu about people who may be interested in the politically motivated cases against Tundu Lissu.' THRDC said observing public trials is part of a fair judicial process under international law, and has appointed Advocate Hekima Mwasipu to take legal steps aimed at securing the immediate and unconditional release of the three.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 18, 2025 09:12 AM\nSource:[Standard Digital News - Kenya](http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001519382/rights-group-slams-tanzania-over-detention-of-karua-and-two-others)\n\n**Tanzanian Opposition Leader Arrested at Airport Ahead of Belgium Trip**\nTanzanian police arrested Amani Golugwa, a senior official of the main opposition party Chadema, at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam on Monday as he was preparing to travel to Belgium for a political conference.

The opposition party, Chadema, said that Ng'wila was detained at Julius Nyerere International Airport in the capital, Dar es Salaam, on Monday. The police confirmed the arrest on their official Instagram account, stating that Ng'wila 'had a habit of traveling abroad and returning without following legal procedures.' This comes amid growing concerns about a crackdown on opposition leaders ahead of the October elections. Despite President Samia Suluhu Hassan's claims that the government is committed to respecting human rights and freedoms, a series of arrests has raised questions about her record in this area. The International Democratic Union condemned the arrest and described it as 'outside the values of democracy' and 'incompatible with public freedoms.' They called for Ng'wila's immediate release. The police had previously arrested Chadema leader Tundu Lissu, a prominent opposition figure who survived an assassination attempt in 2017 and came second in the last presidential election. He was charged with treason, rebellion, and disrupting elections after organizing several protests across the country in April, calling for fundamental reforms in the electoral process. Days after Lissu's arrest, the electoral commission banned Chadema from participating in future elections due to its refusal to sign the electoral code of conduct.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 14, 2025 04:24 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/5/14/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%84%d8%b7%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%aa%d9%86%d8%b2%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d8%b9%d8%aa%d9%82%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%b3%d8%a4%d9%88%d9%84%d8%a7-%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b2%d8%a7)\n\n**Tanzania Arrests Opposition Figure Ahead of Elections**\nThe main opposition party in Tanzania, 'Chadema', said that 'authorities arrested a key member of the party while he was on his way to attend a political conference in Belgium', indicating growing concerns about the escalation of the campaign before the scheduled elections in October. The president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, who is planning to run for re-election, said that 'the government is committed to respecting human rights.' A prominent member of the opposition party, Amrani Gologwa, was arrested at Julius Nyerere International Airport in the capital, Dar es Salaam, on Monday, according to a post published by his party on the 'X' platform. The Tanzanian police also confirmed the arrest, posting on Instagram that Gologwa 'had a travel document to leave the country and return without following the legal procedures.' The police added that the Dar es Salaam police zone is continuing to investigate the case in cooperation with other security agencies. Gologwa was scheduled to represent his party at a forum organized by the International Union of Democracy in Brussels. The 'African Democrats Union' strongly condemned 'the illegal arrest and attack on Chadema', according to a post on the 'X' platform, stating that 'silencing opposition voices is a violation of the essence of democracy.' They called for his immediate release. It's worth noting that the police in Tanzania arrested the leader of Chadema and the main opposition figure in Tanzania, Tundu Lissu, last month, accusing him of 'treason.' The arrest came after Lissu called for electoral reforms in a speech during a general meeting.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 14, 2025 02:34 PM\nSource:[\u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0646](https://www.almayadeen.net/news/politics/%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A4%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%AB%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B3%D9%84)\n\n**Tanzania arrests opposition official Amani Golugwa travelling to political conference**\nTanzanian authorities arrested Amani Golugwa, a senior opposition official, at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam on Monday as he was departing for a political conference in Belgium.

Lissu was arrested earlier this month on charges of incitement after participating in a rally in Mbinga, where he called for electoral reform. According to Chadema's spokesperson, Brenda Rupia, the detention was an attempt to prevent them from participating in the judicial process, as they were later released. The Tanzanian government had previously denied Chadema's allegations of repression, including the prohibition of participating in the upcoming elections. The National Electoral Commission had banned Chadema after the party refused to sign a Code of Ethics, which commits participating parties to accepting official election results. Chadema's legal secretary described the ban as unconstitutional and stated that the party should only face penalties, not be prohibited from participating in the election. The upcoming October elections are expected to favor incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan, of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party, founded by independence leader Julius K.

    "summary": "All expert forecasters strongly agree that the probability of Amani Golugwa being released from Tanzanian custody before June 15, 2025, is very low, assigning final probabilities ranging from 7% to 15% (with one notable outlier at 3% Yes, i.e., 97% No). The key reasons are: (1) the Tanzanian government's intensified crackdown on opposition figures, especially CHADEMA leadership, ahead of October 2025 elections; (2) the typical use of vague or technical charges to justify extended detention without prompt judicial review or bail; (3) a track record of holding Tanzanian opposition politicians for prolonged periods, unlike foreign activists who have sometimes been released quickly after diplomatic pressure; (4) weak judicial independence and transparency, providing little recourse for rapid release; and (5) international condemnation is present but does not appear significant enough, as of the forecast date, to pressure authorities toward early release. While all experts note a small chance authorities could release Golugwa in response to unforeseen surges in international or domestic pressure, or as a political gesture (as has rarely happened with domestic figures), the prevailing pattern and base rates overwhelmingly support continued detention through the resolution window. Scenarios leading to a Yes outcome generally require either a dramatic escalation in external pressure or a calculated regime decision to defuse criticism, neither of which is visible in current reporting. As a result, consensus is that Golugwa will almost certainly remain in custody beyond the target date."
