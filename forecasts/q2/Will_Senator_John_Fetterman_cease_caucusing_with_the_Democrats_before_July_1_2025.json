Historically, party switches are vanishingly rare except in cases involving major principle-breaks or survival needs, neither of which seem sufficiently advanced yet here. Staff resignations and missed votes may signal dissatisfaction and some instability, but do not by themselves portend imminent resignation, especially given Fetterman's counter-attack posture and Republican defense. The time window is short (barely a month), making abrupt institutional processes (expulsion, formal disaffiliation) highly unlikely barring a scandal or health crisis not yet in evidence. In sum, significant visible tension and plausible scenarios for a surprise, but not enough for high odds. The most compelling argument against a 'Yes' outcome is Fetterman's own repeated, categorical denial of both caucus departure and resignation possibilities. I judge the probability above a pure base rate for party defection/resignation in a Senate term (typically well under 2%), but short of a true coin flip.",

The case was accurately made that even severe turbulence very rarely translates into an abrupt party switch or resignation, especially on this compressed timeline, unless there is evidence of process-level movement (committee removals, whip outreach, or overt leadership intervention), which are absent. The scenario analysis did not surface any new specific, imminent threat (e.g., unfolding scandal or new health crisis). Thus, I recognize that my initial probability may have been somewhat inflated out of respect for the expanded resolution criteria and unprecedented narrative intensity, but institutional inertia and historical precedent should carry more weight. Slight downward revision is appropriate.",

My main critique of those forecasting higher is the overweighting of media-driven possibilities and undervaluing the inertia of party identity and structure. If anything, additional discussion reinforced that, barring a true health crisis or scandal in the next month, all plausible forecast paths still end with Fetterman remaining where he is.

Other forecasters converged on low single-digit probabilities, consistently citing modern procedural inertia, the absence of concrete steps toward a switch or resignation, and the very short time window. Even critiques of my initial analysis acknowledge the structural barriers remain dominant, though they warn not to discount the compounding small shocks.

Even the highest probabilities (up to 12%) stem from interpretive elevation of ongoing turbulence, not from tangible evidence of imminent caucus rupture or resignation. Critiques of risk inflation underscore how the absence of procedural signals (leadership moves, committee changes, or formalized talks) and Fetterman's consistent public denials should anchor the forecast at the low end. No new external pressures or acute health events have emerged since the initial assessment. The most aggressive journalism-based arguments for heightened risk still do not reach a threshold, and group consensus solidifies the base-rate view. I see no reason to adjust my probability up or down: the evidence remains overwhelmingly in favor of Fetterman remaining in the Democratic caucus through July 1, barring the arrival of a true black swan.",

Defenses of the process/inertia perspective were compelling and well-supported by historical base rates and modern Senate practices. No new evidence emerged in the deliberation or forecast reviews to justify shifting higher or lower. My own argument, grounded in party system dynamics and the PA context, remains solid.

The overwhelming consensus across multiple expert lenses\u2014from congressional procedure to party system analysis\u2014reinforces the rarity of midterm Senate caucus departures, especially with just a month to go and in the absence of a concrete, triggering event. The arguments to push the probability into the double digits (as seen in the journalism-oriented forecast) rely primarily on narrative churn and sensationalism rather than procedural or institutional signals. The only legitimate risk premium comes from Fetterman's unique visibility, staff turmoil, and the slight chance of a health event. However, the fact-pattern is still most consistent with status quo persistence through July 1. The best-informed base rate guidance\u2014from both history and contemporary context\u2014warrants a sub-10% figure.

He attributes this trend to the party's weak leadership and lack of clear values. Former state Senate Democratic leader Jason Pizzo and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan are among those who have already made the switch. While Sen.

Eric Wimberger, R-Oconto, fired back, saying there are no back-room deals regarding tax cuts that Democrats wouldn't already be aware of.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 27, 2025 06:24 PM\nSource:[WJFW NewsWatch 12](https://www.wjfw.com/wisconsin-dems-claim-gop-pushing-tax-deal-for-wealthy/article_146dcd1c-a063-587f-8b0d-d6b2d1fad400.html)\n\n**Photos of the week | May 16-22, 2025 - Roll Call**\nIt was a somber week in Washington with the passing of Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., and the shooting of two Israeli Embassy workers. However, the House also made significant progress on the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act', with late-night markups and a visit from President Donald Trump. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Freedom Caucus members expressed their views on the bill, while Reps. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., and Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, comforted aides after a tribute to the late Rep. Connolly. The House Rules Committee hearing on the bill lasted from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Wednesday, and President Trump met with House Republicans to discuss the budget reconciliation bill. 'It was a great week for the House,' said Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. 'We made significant progress on the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' and took important steps towards passing the budget reconciliation bill.' However, the week was not without its challenges, as Rep. LaMonica McIver was charged with assaulting law enforcement officers outside a New Jersey ICE detention facility. 'We will continue to work tirelessly to pass legislation that benefits the American people,' said House Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain, R-Mich. 'We will not be deterred by the challenges we face.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 23, 2025 03:24 PM\nSource:[rollcall.com](https://rollcall.com/2025/05/23/photos-of-the-week-may-16-22-2025/)\n\n**EDITORIAL: A coordinated political attack**\nSen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, is facing a coordinated attack from his own party and the media over his mental health and performance. The attacks come after Fetterman expressed support for Israel, fracking, and more aggressive immigration policies, and met with President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees. New York magazine quoted aides as saying that Fetterman's stroke has led to erratic behavior, but others, including Republican Sen. Dave McCormick, have defended Fetterman, calling him 'authentic, decent, principled, and a fighter.' The real offense, according to the article, is Fetterman's willingness to work with the White House and confront progressive orthodoxy, particularly on issues related to the Middle East. Democrats are threatening to primary Fetterman in 2028, but the article suggests that this may be a difficult task in purple Pennsylvania.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 17, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-a-coordinated-political-attack-3373990/)\n\n**Sean Spicer says John Fetterman should 'step down' and 'get the help that he needs'**\nFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer called for Democratic Pennsylvania Sen.

Fetterman's office has been contacted by Republicans, including Senator Tom Cotton, Senator Chuck Grassley, and Senator Dave McCormick, who have defended him against attacks on his health and political stances. However, some Democrats, such as Senator Ruben Gallego, have expressed confidence in Fetterman's ability to serve his constituents, saying 'There needs to be space for Fetterman and for other senators in our caucus.' Fetterman has voted against the budget blueprint that would extend tax cuts, and has confirmed his opposition to these efforts. His health has been a focal point since his stroke in 2022, with some staffers raising concerns about his mental and physical health. Fetterman has responded to these concerns, saying 'My doctors are like 'John is great.'

Senators Tom Cotton, Chuck Grassley, and Dave McCormick defended Fetterman, who has been criticized for his hawkish stance on Israel and his softer line with President Trump. Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres accused Fetterman's critics of attacking him for his 'unapologetic pro-Israel politics.' Reports from New York magazine and The Philadelphia Inquirer exposed Fetterman's temper issues, disengagement from duties, and missed medical check-ups. Despite these concerns, Republicans may be trying to rally around Fetterman because they see an opportunity to replace him in 2028 with a Republican. A recent internal poll shows Fetterman losing support from Democratic voters in his home area of Pittsburgh. Fetterman's wife, Gisele, has also reportedly been at odds with him over his turn toward Trump and his support for Israel.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 09, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[newrepublic.com](https://newrepublic.com/post/195091/republicans-support-john-fetterman)\n\n**Fetterman Triggers His Own Party, Confirms Support for Republican Book**\nSen.

Dave McCormick. Fetterman and his wife are set to appear at a book tour event in Pittsburgh to promote McCormick's new release, 'Who Believed in You?' The book is about the life-changing impact of mentorship. Fetterman has been critical of some of the positions his Democratic colleagues have taken, including lax border security and lack of support for Israel. His actions have sparked criticism from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former Rep. Conor Lamb, and Cumberland County Democratic Party Chair Matt Roan, who have accused Fetterman of collaborating with the Trump administration and capitulating to Republican Party interests. Roan has even called for Fetterman's resignation, stating that he no longer represents the interests of those who elected him.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 28, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[The Western Journal](https://www.westernjournal.com/fetterman-triggers-party-confirms-support-republican-book/)\n\n**Swing state senators come together in rare show of bipartisanship, Dems aren't happy about it**\nPennsylvania Senators Dave McCormick and John Fetterman are hosting a joint public event in Pittsburgh, but it has sparked protests from activists who are unhappy with Fetterman's bipartisan show of support for his Republican colleague's new book. Former Rep. Conor Lamb, Fetterman's 2022 Democratic primary contender, has accused Fetterman of not listening to his constituents and instead 'cheering on Dave McCormick's book signing.' Fetterman has been criticized for not hosting a public event in Pennsylvania in over two months, while McCormick actively shares his weekly meetings with constituents on social media. The protesters are also upset about Fetterman's support for Israel and his co-sponsorship of the Laken Riley Act, which allows ICE to detain undocumented immigrants who commit crimes in the United States. 'He's been saying the same thing about Democrats now for six months, we get it,' Lamb said. 'Democrats know we have some issues, but he has a job to do...

Roan criticized Fetterman's efforts to work with Republicans, including his support for a Republican government funding bill and his decision to vote in favor of confirming Pam Bondi as attorney general. Roan also criticized Fetterman for refusing to hold town hall meetings in Pennsylvania and for his support of Republican-backed measures on immigration and Israel. Fetterman has dismissed rumors that he is considering switching parties to become a Republican, saying, 'I am not going to become a Republican. I would make a pretty terrible Republican because, you know, pro-choice, pro-really strong immigration, pro-LGBTQ.' However, Roan argues that Fetterman's actions are 'actively harming Pennsylvanians' and that he has 'completely abandoned the core values of our Party.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 24, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/john-fetterman-told-resign-home-state-newspaper-2049708)\n\n**Fetterman's response to AOC after she said Dems must 'fight harder'**\nPennsylvania Senator John Fetterman continued his public feud with fellow Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after she criticized his vote to approve a Republican continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown. Fetterman dismissed Ocasio-Cortez's call to 'fight harder' against Donald Trump, saying that shutting down the government would have harmed millions and plunged the country into chaos. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to respond by making peace with Fetterman's 2022 primary rival, Connor Lamb, and thanked him for his support. Fetterman has been pushing back on his own caucus' approach to the continuing resolution and accused Senate Democrats of 'theater' to save face. He also slammed his party's muted response to President Trump's address to Congress, calling it a 'sad cavalcade of self owns and unhinged petulance.'

According to former staffer Carrie Adams, 'I don't agree with him,' Adams told The Free Press. 'I have a sense that his international views are a lot less nuanced than my generation.' The resignations, which began last year, have been attributed to differences with Fetterman regarding Israel. As reported by Yedioth Aharanoth, the office work environment was 'almost entirely consumed by Israel-related matters.' Fetterman's shift to the right has frustrated some within the Democratic caucus, who had campaigned as a progressive in the 2022 Senate race in Pennsylvania.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 05:03 PM\nSource:[thejewishvoice.com](https://tjvnews.com/2025/02/senator-fettermans-staffers-quit-in-protest-of-his-support-for-israel/)\n\n**Opinion | Pennsylvania, the swing state that defies conventional wisdom**\nPennsylvania's two senators, John Fetterman and Dave McCormick, have a unique relationship, despite being from different parties. They have a warm and collaborative relationship, often finding common ground on issues such as inflation, immigration, and the importance of preserving the state's industrial heritage. Fetterman, a Democrat, and McCormick, a Republican, have much in common, including their love of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Sheetz convenience stores. They have worked together on issues such as affordable housing and have expressed a desire to preserve the people's way of life in Pennsylvania. The future of the state's iconic steel industry is uncertain, with the company facing financial difficulties and potential foreign ownership. Fetterman and McCormick have expressed concerns about the potential sale of the company to a foreign entity, with Trump stating that he would block an all-out acquisition. The two senators seem open to working together to find solutions to the state's challenges.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/24/pennsylvania-fetterman-mccormick-steel-industry/)\n\n**Fetterman's Office Experiences Wave of Resignations Amid Shift to Right**\nSenator John Fetterman's office in Pennsylvania is experiencing a wave of resignations and departures due to his consistent defense of Israel and his abandonment of progressive policies he advocated for during his 2022 election campaign. According to Aqila Lisi, a reporter for The Intercept, the departures reflect a deep sense of disappointment among Fetterman's staff due to his refusal to support progressive policies and his shift to the right, embracing Donald Trump's extreme views. One former staffer said, 'The big change in staff' in Fetterman's office 'is in a tough hiring environment for Democratic staff in Washington.' Another former staffer said, 'I don't find this surprising,' adding, 'I think the reason staff are frustrated is that working in Fetterman's office means working for Israel all the time.' Two of the latest departures are Charlie Heilz, Fetterman's communications director, who will leave on Friday, and legislative director Taryn Easton, whose departure date is unclear. Easton told NBC News in a statement, 'We've created a legislative team that I believe is a blueprint for how Democrats should govern when they have power.' Heilz and Fetterman's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A former campaign staffer said the staff exodus is a sign that people in Fetterman's office are tired of his abandonment of promises to ease the economy for the working class, defend the poor, immigrants, and the LGBTQ+ community, and push for criminal justice reform in the Senate.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 02:22 PM\nSource:[thenationpress.net](https://thenationpress.net/news-257051.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts assess that the probability of Senator John Fetterman ceasing to caucus with the Democrats before July 1, 2025 is low\u2014individual forecasts range from 3% to 12%, with most clustered between 4% and 8%. The consensus reasoning is as follows:\n\n- Fetterman is highly estranged from some portions of the Democratic Party, receiving criticism from both party progressives and local party officials over ideological stances, staff turnover, and media scrutiny. Despite this, he has repeatedly and categorically denied any plans to resign, switch parties, or end his caucus affiliation.\n\n- Institutional and personal incentives (retaining committee assignments, staff, resource access, and preserving reelection prospects in a purple state) weigh heavily against an abrupt departure. Party leadership also has strong motivation to avoid ceding a Senate seat or narrative win in a closely divided chamber.\n\n- Several experts note public GOP outreach to Fetterman and some cross-party defenses, but all agree there is little evidence he is seriously considering switching in the short window before July 1, 2025.\n\n- The most substantial theoretical risks to a sudden caucus break are a severe health crisis or unexpected scandal, neither of which currently show clear signs of imminent occurrence.\n\n- Base rates for senators ceasing to caucus with their party, especially on short notice, are extremely low absent major, public precipitating factors. Historical precedents (e.g., party switching or resignations) have been rare and usually foreshadowed by even more severe and sustained rifts than currently observed.\n\n- In sum, all experts judge that, barring a dramatic and unforeseen shock (such as a health emergency or forced resignation), Fetterman will continue caucusing with Democrats through the July 1 deadline. The turbulent news cycle and ongoing intra-party dissension do not, in current form, rise to the level likely to break the institutional inertia and personal incentives keeping him in the caucus."
