However, official forecasts for May at the national level are much stronger (+9% plan, likely due to inventory rebalancing, but these plans are often overoptimistic). Regionally, AI/semiconductor themes remain robust and can occasionally produce surprises. Business sentiment, labor shortfalls, cost shocks, and uncertainty about exports (from new US/EU tariffs) dampen expectations, and the financial/consumer-facing sectors in Tohoku remain weak.

While sectoral resilience (semiconductors, food) and some positive BOJ/official commentary offer a modest buffer, negative global signals (tariffs, PMI under 50), labor constraints, and the sheer magnitude of March's spike point to a high likelihood of a pullback. I weight the probability heavily toward 'No' (flat/negative), but do not go to 0% due to strong momentum in certain sectors and ongoing recovery language in official regional reports.

While national production weakens, Tohoku\u2019s sectoral strengths and the ongoing recovery in regional consumer spending (supported by rising real wages and tourism) keep industrial activity on a mild upward path.

Tohoku\u2019s sectoral composition (strong in machinery/semiconductor, some food/chemicals, lagging in autos) and ongoing BOJ and METI reports hint at continued strength in machinery (semiconductors, AI-related), while auto backlogs provide some resilience. However, the combination of national IP declining in April, weak business sentiment in Tohoku, labor constraints, and negative external shocks (China/Europe slowdown, Trump tariffs) weigh heavily. The sharply positive March reading raises the probability of a small technical pullback. Still, Tohoku\u2019s unique sectoral drivers offer a mild counterbalance. On balance, the stronger weight of the negative signals in April\u2014especially the national IP fall and worsening local sentiment\u2014make a repeat gain somewhat unlikely barring sector-specific surges.

While peers try to handwave a few percentage points upward on 'sectoral volatility,' you insist on rooting the forecast in how the machinery/semiconductor axis behaves *in practice* post-surge\u2014almost always correcting downward, especially as the industrial chain digests the shock. Your number leaves scope for idiosyncratic surprise, but treats a repeat positive MoM as the tail event it is. Well done holding the line against wishful thinking."

The evidence doesn't just nudge against a repeat MoM gain; it shoves it. A 7.6% surge, concentrated in semiconductors, is precisely when you *should* lean hard into regression toward the mean, especially when national IP is negative, Tohoku business confidence has cratered, and global trade is under multiple clouds. You can't have it both ways: if payback is typical and macro signals are down, giving one-in-three odds for an April increase seems mathematically unjustified. Your probability still grants a level of persistence to the March anomaly that historical Tohoku and Japanese regional cycles flatly contradict.

The cases for a sequential gain have not been meaningfully bolstered by any sectoral or seasonal factor; in fact, the argument for a reversion-to-mean is strengthened by even closer historical parallels and by the overwhelming business pessimism in Tohoku.

The outlier probabilities (i.e., 35\u201340%) failed to provide compelling, data-based reasons for a higher view; arguments in support of tail risk were often generic or based on a vague sense of volatility, not borne out by concrete patterns in the Tohoku IIP time series.

The dollar is rising, up 0.44% to R$ 5.69. Attention is focused on negotiations between Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Congressional leaders on a possible agreement to reduce the impact of IOF and make structural proposals viable. The advance may occur today, before President Lula's trip to France. Haddad will participate in an event in Bras\u00edlia in the morning and is expected to use the opportunity to reinforce the government's economic agenda. In China, industrial activity is a concern, with the PMI index falling to 48.3 in May, the lowest level in eight months, and below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In Europe, the consumer price index (CPI) in the euro zone decelerated to 1.9% in May, below the European Central Bank's (ECB) target and market projections. The OECD's Global Perspectives report also released today has a more cautious tone for the global economy, revising downward growth projections for the US and G20 countries, warning of the impact of Donald Trump's protectionist measures. Global growth expectations were cut to 2.9% in 2025. In the US, the market will follow the Jolts report, which measures job openings in April, marking the start of the employment data round this week, culminating in the payroll on Friday. The industrial production in Brazil grew only 0.1% in April, compared to March, according to the Industrial Production Monthly Survey - Physical Production (PIM-PF), released today by the IBGE. The result confirms the deceleration of activity, after the 1.2% increase in March, and is in line with the recent release of the first-quarter GDP, which was slightly below expectations. In comparison to April 2024, industrial production fell 0.3%. In the accumulated 2025, up to April, the sector registers an increase of 1.4%. Already, in the accumulated 12 months, the advance is 2.4%.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 10:21 AM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/invest/mercados/ibovespa-abre-proximo-da-estabilidade-dolar-opera-em-alta-de-044/)\n\n**Tohoku Companies' Revenue and Profit Expectations Fall to 3-Year Low**\nA survey by the Imperial Data Bank in Sendai found that 19.2% of companies in the Tohoku region expect to see an increase in revenue and profits in 2025, a decrease of 0.3 points from the previous survey. This is the first time in three years that the region has seen a decrease. The survey also found that 26.2% of companies in the region expect to see a decrease in revenue and profits, exceeding the national average of 21.2%. The main factors contributing to the decline in performance were the fluctuation in oil and material prices (41.5%), inflation (39.6%), and the deepening labor shortage (38.5%). The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariff policy is also a risk factor. In terms of company size, large companies were more likely to expect an increase in revenue and profits (27.3%), while small and medium-sized enterprises were more likely to expect a decrease (26.4% and 24.7% respectively). The financial industry was the most optimistic, with 42.9% of companies expecting an increase in revenue and profits due to the expected improvement in lending yields. The agriculture, forestry, and fisheries industry also saw a high percentage of companies expecting an increase in revenue and profits (39.1%), as well as the transportation and warehousing industry (28.6%). On the other hand, the construction industry (35.7%) and the service industry (31.3%) were more likely to expect a decrease in revenue and profits, with one service industry company in Iwate Prefecture stating that they were struggling to cover the increased labor costs.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 10:10 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC038VN0T00C25A6000000/)\n\n**Nikkei 225 Rises 38 Yen Amid Attention to US Economic Indicators**\nThe Nikkei 225 index rose by 38 yen, with investors paying attention to US economic indicators.

The report noted that employment levels rose at the fastest pace in over a year, as companies sought to support their capacity in anticipation of an improvement in global demand. Companies cited weak global demand, affected by US tariffs and customer hesitation, as negatively impacting new orders and production schedules, however, there were initial indications of a potential improvement in the sector's performance next year, with increased confidence in future production.

According to the INE, the monthly variation was 1.2% (after a 3.9% decline in March) in terms of monthly variation. The large groups contributed positively to the aggregated index, especially in the case of investment goods, where the industry recorded a monthly increase of 2.1% (a 2.9% decline in the previous month), which meant a contribution of 0.4 percentage points. The groups of intermediate goods and energy contributed both with 0.3 percentage points, through increases of 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively (after a decline of 7.5% and an increase of 15.4% in March). The homologous trend was totally different. The aggregated index fell again compared to the same month of 2024, but advanced 3.2 percentage points compared to the previous month.

The dollar is rising, up 0.44% to R$ 5.69. Attention is focused on negotiations between Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Congressional leaders on a possible agreement to reduce the impact of IOF and make structural proposals viable. The advance may occur today, before President Lula's trip to France. Haddad will participate in an event in Bras\u00edlia in the morning and is expected to use the opportunity to reinforce the government's economic agenda. In China, industrial activity is a concern, with the PMI index falling to 48.3 in May, the lowest level in eight months, and below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In Europe, the consumer price index (CPI) in the euro zone decelerated to 1.9% in May, below the European Central Bank's (ECB) target and market projections. The OECD's Global Perspectives report also released today has a more cautious tone for the global economy, revising downward growth projections for the US and G20 countries, warning of the impact of Donald Trump's protectionist measures. Global growth expectations were cut to 2.9% in 2025. In the US, the market will follow the Jolts report, which measures job openings in April, marking the start of the employment data round this week, culminating in the payroll on Friday. The industrial production in Brazil grew only 0.1% in April, compared to March, according to the Industrial Production Monthly Survey - Physical Production (PIM-PF), released today by the IBGE. The result confirms the deceleration of activity, after the 1.2% increase in March, and is in line with the recent release of the first-quarter GDP, which was slightly below expectations.

This is the first time in three years that the region has seen a decrease. The survey also found that 26.2% of companies in the region expect to see a decrease in revenue and profits, exceeding the national average of 21.2%. The main factors contributing to the decline in performance were the fluctuation in oil and material prices (41.5%), inflation (39.6%), and the deepening labor shortage (38.5%). The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariff policy is also a risk factor. In terms of company size, large companies were more likely to expect an increase in revenue and profits (27.3%), while small and medium-sized enterprises were more likely to expect a decrease (26.4% and 24.7% respectively). The financial industry was the most optimistic, with 42.9% of companies expecting an increase in revenue and profits due to the expected improvement in lending yields. The agriculture, forestry, and fisheries industry also saw a high percentage of companies expecting an increase in revenue and profits (39.1%), as well as the transportation and warehousing industry (28.6%). On the other hand, the construction industry (35.7%) and the service industry (31.3%) were more likely to expect a decrease in revenue and profits, with one service industry company in Iwate Prefecture stating that they were struggling to cover the increased labor costs.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 10:10 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC038VN0T00C25A6000000/)\n\n**Nikkei Index Expected to Rise Amidst US-China Trade Uncertainty**\nDespite the escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, the Nikkei index opened high on Tuesday (June 3). US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that President Trump will soon speak with Chinese leaders to resolve the rare earth dispute. According to a Reuters survey, as the uncertainty of US trade policies continues to dissipate, the Nikkei index is expected to rise to 39,600 points by the end of the year, with short-term fluctuations possible. It is predicted that by mid-2026, the index will reach 40,875 points, and by the end of that year, it will reach 42,000 points. The Japanese stock market has been volatile over the past few months, with a 27% decline in August, plunging into a bear market. The Japanese central bank's quantitative tightening policy to curb inflation has weakened the yen's safe-haven properties. The yen has been appreciating since the beginning of the year, eroding the profits of exporters. The imposition of US tariffs on car imports is particularly concerning, as Japanese automakers face a sharp decline in sales in their main market, with Toyota executives warning of the impact on their business. According to a separate calculation by the Nikkei newspaper, by March next year, Japan's seven major automakers will lose nearly 3.1 trillion yen in profits. These companies account for a significant portion of the Nikkei index. It has been fluctuating around the 200-day moving average for some time, with little sign of breaking through. Therefore, it is possible that it will fall below 37,300 points again and then rebound. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: June 03, 2025 08:43 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u5916\u6c47](http://forex.hexun.com/2025-06-03/219382883.html)\n\n**Nikkei 225 Rises 38 Yen Amid Attention to US Economic Indicators**\nThe Nikkei 225 index rose by 38 yen, with investors paying attention to US economic indicators.

The report noted that employment levels rose at the fastest pace in over a year, as companies sought to support their capacity in anticipation of an improvement in global demand. Companies cited weak global demand, affected by US tariffs and customer hesitation, as negatively impacting new orders and production schedules, however, there were initial indications of a potential improvement in the sector's performance next year, with increased confidence in future production.

This move, which took effect from Wednesday, once again raised concerns about global trade stability and had a significant impact on investors' sentiment across the region, including a subdued closing for India's reference index, Sensex. The primary catalyst for the market decline was President Trump's statement, made during a speech to American steelworkers at US Steel's Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. 'We will raise tariffs on steel from 25% to 50% in the US,' Trump said, adding that these high tariffs would 'further secure the steel industry.' He later confirmed via a post on Truth Social that the new steel tariffs will take effect on June 4. This aggressive trade stance immediately cast a shadow over markets dependent on international trade. Regional market reaction: broad declines with few exceptions The effects of Trump's announcement were felt on all Asian stock exchanges. Japan's reference index, Nikkei 225, fell sharply by 1.30% to 37,470.67, while the broader Topix index dropped by 0.87% to 2,777.29. In South Korea, the Kospi index closed the trading day almost unchanged at 2,698.97, showing some resilience. However, the Kosdaq index, which tracks small-cap stocks, managed to rise by 0.81% to 740.29, and investors are also looking forward to the country's presidential election scheduled for June 3. It is worth noting that markets in China, Malaysia, and New Zealand were closed due to holidays, which may have reduced regional trading volumes. In economic news from Japan, factory activity decreased in May at the slowest pace in five months, providing a glimmer of improvement in the manufacturing sector. The final purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing industry from Jibun Bank in Japan rose to 49.4 in May from 48.7 in April. Although this was the eleventh consecutive month that the index remained below the 50-point threshold that separates contraction from expansion, the increase was seen as a preliminary positive factor. 'There were preliminary signs of a potential improvement in the sector's performance over the coming year... the workforce increased at the fastest pace in over a year,' commented Annabel Fiddes, deputy chief economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. Indian markets: Sensex gives way to global pressure Indian stock indices reflected the broader regional caution. The BSE Sensex closed 77 points lower, while the Nifty 50 also fell and closed below the 24,700 level. Earlier in the session, India's Nifty 50 was reported to be down 0.10%. One of the few notable winners on an otherwise subdued Indian market was Adani Ports, whose shares rose by 2%. Undercurrents on the US market: futures contracts fall after strong May The renewed trade orona also affected US stock futures, which fell as Wall Street prepared for the start of a new trading month after a strong development in May. S&P 500 futures traded down 0.3%, a sentiment shared by Nasdaq-100 futures. Terminers related to the Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell by 108 points, or 0.3%. This came after a mixed closing for the three major US averages the previous Friday. The S&P 500 changed little and fell by 0.01% to 5,911.69, but still closed a significant winning month. The Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.32% to 19,113.77, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to rise by 54.34 points, or 0.13%, and closed at 42,270.07.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 10:45 AM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/sv/nyheter/2025/06/02/asiatiska-marknader-stanger-aktier-faller-pa-trumps-hojning-av-staltullar-sensex-slutar-77-poang-lagre/)\n\n**Industrial Production Advances 1.2% in April, Despite Homologous Decline**\nIndustrial production advanced 1.2% in April, despite a homologous decline.

The transportation machinery sector has also seen a recovery, supported by the rebound in production by automakers. Personal consumption is 'slowly recovering', with tourism demand remaining strong and retailers investing in multilingual self-service checkout systems to cater to inbound tourists. However, there is also a shift towards low-priced products, particularly household goods, as consumers become more frugal. The labor and income environment is 'improving', with a tightening labor market, but some companies are struggling to raise wages due to delayed price increases.

The transportation machinery industry improved by 14 points, reaching +22, with the continued production of automobiles helping to support industry sentiment. Toyota Motor East Japan, which had stopped production of three models (Yaris Cross, etc.) for about three months due to a certification issue, is now working to clear up the backlog of orders. The US Trump administration's planned additional tariffs were not included in the survey, as the announcement was made just before the survey period ended. The non-manufacturing industry had a DI of +10, down 1 point from the previous survey. 5 out of 12 industries showed a decline. The accommodation and food services industry declined by 28 points, reaching +4, due to a decrease in customer traffic caused by a rise in prices and a shift towards cost-cutting. Bank of Japan Sapporo Branch Manager, Katsuyama Kazuo, said at a press conference, 'The service consumption as a whole remains in good shape.' Looking at the 25-year investment plan, all industries showed a 2.7% increase from the previous year, indicating that companies are maintaining an optimistic stance. Katsuyama said, 'The strong investment is an important engine for economic recovery.' The forward-looking DI for the next 3 months showed a manufacturing industry DI of -2, improving by 1 point. The industry is expecting a decrease in raw material prices and a recovery in overseas demand. The non-manufacturing industry had a DI of +5, declining by 5 points. The labor shortage remains a heavy burden on companies. The labor personnel judgment index, which is calculated by subtracting the percentage of companies that answered 'shortage' from those that answered 'excess', was -36 for all industries. The non-manufacturing industry had a -44, the most severe since the 2000s. Katsuyama said that the labor shortage is the biggest challenge, but also a driving force for the economy, 'It has led to cost-cutting investments to increase productivity.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: April 01, 2025 10:20 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQODL26AC90W5A320C2000000/)\n\n**Asian Factory Activity Slows Down Ahead of Trump's Tariff Announcement**\nFactory activity in some of Asia's largest industrial countries slowed down in March, ahead of US President Donald Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Japan's manufacturing activity index remained in contraction for the ninth consecutive month, while South Korea's reading remained below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction, according to the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released by 'S&P'. Taiwan fell below the 50-point threshold for the first time since last year, while the index in Thailand declined after a slight growth in the previous month. Vietnam entered the expansion zone for the first time since November. In South Korea, which is a key indicator of global trade due to its role in global supply chains and the diversity of its exports, domestic demand decreased despite a surge in international sales at the fastest pace since January 2024, led by the US and the Asia-Pacific region. Some of this demand may be a reflection of attempts to buy products before the new tariffs take effect. Indicators of commercial disruptions are increasing. In South Korea, manufacturers pointed to rising raw material prices. Business leaders across the region, including Japan, expressed concern about future demand conditions in the face of geopolitical risks. In Taiwan, the main producer of semiconductors, new orders grew at a slower pace than last year, with companies attributing the decline to weak domestic and foreign demand, particularly in Europe, Japan, and the US. Even in Vietnam, where overall industrial activity improved, new export orders declined at the fastest pace since July 2023, marking a fifth consecutive month of decline. These regional data come after the release of China's PMI numbers yesterday, which showed an improvement in the industrial sector exceeding economists' expectations. PMI numbers for India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore are due to be released on Wednesday.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: April 01, 2025 05:01 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https://www.aleqt.com/2025/04/01/article_2759236.html)\n\n**Japan's Production Plan Expected to Remain Positive, but Automotive Industry Faces Challenges**\nAccording to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's (METI) production forecast survey, Japan's production plan for March increased by 0.6% compared to the previous month, and is expected to remain positive in April with a 0.1% increase. However, the automotive industry is expected to decline due to the factory explosion accident that occurred in early March. The production of semiconductors and other machinery industries is expected to increase, while the transportation machinery industry, which includes passenger cars and automotive parts, is expected to decline by 5.2%. The focus is on the additional tariffs imposed by the US on imported vehicles, which will be implemented on April 3. While METI states that there is no direct impact at this point, the competitiveness of Japanese cars in the US market may decrease, potentially leading to a decrease in exports. According to a researcher at the Nippon Life Research Institute, 'The ripple effect of the automotive manufacturing industry is significant, and production activity is likely to stagnate for a while.' The industrial production index for February increased by 2.5% compared to the previous year, marking the first positive growth in four months, driven by the production of machinery and electronic components. METI has maintained its production trend judgment as 'one step forward, one step back.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 31, 2025 03:10 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA28AZK0Y5A320C2000000/)\n\n**Japan's Industrial Production Increases 2.5% in February 2025**\nJapan's industrial production in February 2025 increased by 2.5% compared to the previous month, according to the Nikkei newspaper and other media outlets. The production index for the manufacturing industry rose to 102.4, a 10.1% increase in electronic components and devices, and an 8.2% increase in production machinery. The chemical industry also saw a 3.4% increase. However, the transportation machinery industry decreased by 6.2%, and the military and organic chemical industry decreased by 4.0%. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry maintained its 'up and down' assessment of the industrial production trend. The ministry also stated that it will closely monitor the impact of the Trump administration's tariff policy on production, as it has not yet received any information from companies that it directly affects production. 'We will continue to closely monitor the situation,' said the ministry. \nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 31, 2025 01:29 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250331_0003119679)\n\n**Northeastern Region's Industrial Production Index Decreases in January**\nThe northeastern region's industrial production index for January decreased by 1.5% compared to the previous month, reaching 105.0 (2020=100, seasonally adjusted, preliminary value).

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts, the probability that the Tohoku region will show a month-over-month industrial production increase in April 2025 is considered notably below 50%, with most forecasts clustering between 12% and 40%. Nearly all forecasters highlight the exceptional +7.6% jump in March as a highly unlikely event to be immediately followed by another increase, citing strong historical tendencies for mean reversion or slight pullbacks after such outlier surges\u2014particularly in industrially volatile and sector-concentrated regions like Tohoku. Additional common negative factors include worsening local business sentiment (with firm surveys showing three-year lows in revenue/profit expectations and intensifying labor shortages), weak global demand signals (notably US tariffs, slowing Chinese and European markets, and Japanese national industrial production falling 0.9% MoM in April), and ongoing cost and supply chain pressures. A modest minority of arguments slightly raise the chance of an increase, pointing to the ongoing AI/semiconductor demand cycle and possible sector-specific momentum providing mild resilience. Base rates for sequential gains after major positive months are generally quoted as low (around 20\u201340%), and the experts collectively see only mild offsetting upside risk from seasonal or sectoral factors. Probabilities assigned are: 38%, 25%, 33%, 31%, 23%, 35%, 40%, and 12%. The consensus reasoning is that after a large March bounce, the most probable scenario is a mild contraction or near-flat result in April, with only a small chance of another positive month sustained by sector-specific gains or persistent order backlogs."
