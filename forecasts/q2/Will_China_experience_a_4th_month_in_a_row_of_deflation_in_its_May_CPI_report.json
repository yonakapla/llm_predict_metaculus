Given China's structural headwinds\u2014low household confidence, persistent savings preference, soft job market, and trade frictions\u2014deflationary pressure is likely to persist for another month.

Though core CPI is positive (suggesting deflation is not accelerating uncontrollably), there is no evidence that stimulus or seasonal factors in May are strong enough to decisively reverse the YoY negative trend.

Critiques against mechanical or orthodox applications of models are valid, but the practical possibility of a sudden, government-driven CPI jump seems remote for this specific month. No new news or argument in deliberation suggested any upward driver emerged in late May. If anything, group engagement strengthened the case that regime-dependent surprises are real, but rare, and\u2014given lack of supporting signals\u2014they should only slightly dilute confidence, not substantially lower it. An 88% probability aligns with this consensus: bold, but not dogmatic.",

The consensus across disciplines is that all structural drivers point to persistent deflation, and no credible news or signal of a dramatic May turnaround has surfaced. Most critiques and defenses center on just how sticky China's deflation is without major intervention, with only modest caution expressed around the risk of a sudden policy/admin surprise or statistical window-dressing. My critique of others' underweighting of administrative or data risks is noted, but there remains no actual evidence of such a maneuver for May 2025. Notably, those who argue for policy or statistical reversals admit these are low-probability, tail events, not base case drivers. The weighting of base rates, recent data, and China's unique state-capitalist mechanics remain solid at 90%: the situation is dynamic, but no argument or new input justifies a higher or lower forecast.

The vast majority of forecasters with diverse specializations converge on the same diagnosis: entrenched and systemic deflationary pressure, no evidence of a near-term policy breakthrough, and persistent weakness in demand and credit. Defensive arguments stressed the exceedingly high historical base rate once three consecutive months of deflation are observed, while critiques of more cautious or mechanically modeled approaches underscored the (rare but real) risk of political or administrative price changes in China\u2014yet, crucially, there is no signal of such a move for May. No new data surfaced that would warrant significantly increasing or decreasing the probability: neither a meaningful policy surprise nor a shift in food/energy prices was highlighted as plausible for the relevant window. The only marginal adjustment comes from reinforcing the potential for a small, idiosyncratic statistical or political intervention, but this risk continues to appear lower than 10%.

The critiques of my initial forecast correctly call out my excessive hedging on core CPI and statistical reversals, reinforcing that in the current Chinese regime, unless there is clear evidence of a discrete policy intervention, headline deflation persists due to dominant housing, trade, and demand headwinds. No credible signals of a May positive shock have emerged. The panel's confidence, combined with further reflection on the inertia of local stimulus and sharpness of political constraints, supports moving my probability up for a fourth consecutive negative print.

All major signals (home sales, credit transmission jam, PPI, persistent demand weakness) are converging, and every sectoral expert notes no evidence of a policy reversal or inflationary shock. There were thoughtful critiques regarding the potential for last-minute policy or administrative surprises, but these were not supported by news flow or recent institutional behavior for May, making that outcome tail risk only. The group critique also validated my focus on the unique institutional stasis at the local level. Since no compelling argument for a lower probability or a genuinely imminent positive shock emerged, I reaffirm my original estimate. If anything, the group\u2019s confidence and trenchant dismissal of the 'quick bounce back' narrative makes me slightly more confident in the high-80s assignment\u2014but given some credible caution about political statistics management, I will hold my probability at 88%.",

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined from 108.47 in April 2025 to 108.07 in May 2025. Pudji Ismartini, BPS Deputy Statistician for Distribution and Services, stated that the annual inflation rate was recorded at 1.6 percent, and the calendar year inflation rate was recorded at 1.19 percent (ytd). Experts, including Bhima Yudhistira from the Center of Economic and Law Studies (Celios) and Josua Pardede from Bank Permata, predicted deflation in May 2025. Bhima attributed the deflation to post-Eid factors and pressure on the demand side, while Josua estimated that the price decline was mainly driven by the normalization of food prices post-Idulfitri. Josua also noted that government-regulated prices experienced deflation due to the decline in non-subsidized fuel prices and a reduction in air transport fares.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 05:34 AM\nSource:[TEMPO.CO](https://en.tempo.co/read/2013259/indonesia-sees-0-37-deflation-in-may-2025-says-bps)\n\n**China Home Sales Slump Drags On as Deflation Eats Into Incomes**\nChina's residential property sales continued to decline in May, with new-home sales from the 100 largest property companies falling 8.6% from the previous year to 294.6 billion yuan ($40.9 billion), according to China Real Estate Information Corp.

Despite this, the index ended the month with a positive performance, having reached new historical highs. The Ibovespa fell to 137,026.62 points, with a daily high of 138,637.35 points and a low of 136,725.85 points. The total volume of financial transactions was R$31.28 billion. 'After another month of positive rally for Brazilian stocks, the Ibovespa corrected some of the recent gains,' said Eduardo Rahal, chief analyst at Levante Inside Corp. New threats in the US-China trade dispute contributed to caution, with the White House announcing new actions against Beijing after President Donald Trump accused the country of violating a recent agreement. In Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed stable, with inflation data for April still on the radar. 'Trump rekindled the risk of a trade war by accusing China of violating the tariff agreement. This generated a new wave of risk aversion,' said Christian Iarussi, investment specialist at The Hill Capital. In Brazil, the last trading session of May was also marked by the impact of the country's GDP, which grew 1.4% in the first quarter compared to the previous three months, driven by agriculture, in line with expectations. 'We had anticipated a stronger GDP in the first quarter, with a significant contribution from agriculture. This is exactly what happened,' said economists at Bradesco in a report to clients on Friday. 'On the other hand, the cyclical components had a more moderate performance, reflecting a lower dynamism in domestic demand than the overall result may suggest,' they added, foreseeing a slowdown in the coming year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:53 PM\nSource:[noticiasagricolas.com.br](https://www.noticiasagricolas.com.br/noticias/politica-economia/401550-ibovespa-fecha-em-queda-com-realizacao-de-lucros-mas-acumula-alta-em-maio.html)\n\n**China's April 2025 Economic Data Shows Continuing Deflationary Trend - Vision Times**\nChina's April 2025 economic data shows a continuing deflationary trend, according to analysts. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) reported a slight decrease in broad (M2) money supply, but an 8% rise compared to April 2024. Meanwhile, narrow (M1) money supply rose 1.5% year-on-year, but fell by 4.35 trillion yuan in April compared to March. Various types of loans decreased, while deposits fell. SinoInsider, a risk consultancy, notes that the data indicates a trend of 'deflation, weak credit demand, and an economy heavily reliant on government debt to mask underlying vulnerabilities.' The analysts observed that M2 money supply growth was not matched by a similar growth in M1 supply, indicating poor liquidity. They also noted that plummeting RMB loans and deposits reflect subdued credit demand and contracting financing activity, underscoring China's anemic domestic demand. 'Rising domestic skepticism, the U.S.'s imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese exports in early April 2025 disrupted the export sector, likely dampening economic sentiment and consumer spending,' the newsletter reads.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 21, 2025 11:22 PM\nSource:[visiontimes.com](https://www.visiontimes.com/2025/05/21/chinas-april-2025-economic-data-shows-continuing-deflationary-trend.html)\n\n**Inflation slows in May as food prices fall - Economy - The Jakarta Post**\nInflation in Indonesia slowed in May due to a decline in food prices, with a 0.37% month-to-month decrease in the consumer price index (CPI). This marks the deepest monthly deflation since September 2022, according to Statistics Indonesia (BPS). Pudji Ismartini, undersecretary of distribution and services at BPS, stated that the 'food, beverage and tobacco group contributed the most to May 2025's deflation.' The drop was driven by lower prices for horticultural products such as red chilli peppers, cayenne pepper, and shallots, as well as chicken, garlic, and fresh fish. However, tomatoes continued to experience an upward price trend, adding slight inflationary pressure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 11:19 AM\nSource:[The Jakarta Post](https://www.thejakartapost.com/business/2025/06/02/inflation-slows-in-may-as-food-prices-fall.html)\n\n**Unexpected Inflation Surge Shocks Pakistan's Economic Forecast | Headlines**\nPakistan's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 3.5% year-on-year in May, exceeding the Finance Ministry's forecasts of 1.5-2%.

The US trade partner tariffs are still affecting market direction. Trump's announcement of increasing steel tariffs and his comments targeting China have increased global risk perception. Trump said that he will talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping and try to resolve the issue, citing that China has violated a significant part of the agreement. US media reported that Trump's criticism of China for violating the agreement is due to China's refusal to compromise on critical minerals exports. Additionally, there are reports that the US administration plans to expand technology restrictions on China. Analysts stated that trade measures are still a major source of uncertainty for the global economy and that the US administration's changing trade policies are causing investors to be cautious. Trump announced that he will increase the steel tariff to 50% and that the US Steel company in Pennsylvania will apply a 50% tariff on steel imports. Analysts warned that the increase in steel tariffs may have a negative impact on the manufacturing industry. The US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech today at the 75th Anniversary Conference of the International Finance Division of the Fed is being closely watched by investors. Powell's comments on trade measures and the US administration's policies are expected to provide signals on the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy and the impact of trade measures on the US economy. The Michigan University's consumer confidence index, which was released on Friday, showed a upward revision in May to 52.2. The consumer's short-term inflation expectations rose to 6.6% in May from 6.5% in April, while the long-term inflation expectations fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which is a key indicator of inflation for the Fed, rose 0.1% monthly and 2.5% annually in April. These developments suggest that the Fed may keep interest rates steady at its June meeting and may start cutting interest rates in September with an 88% probability. The US stock market indexes, including the Nasdaq, Dow Jones, and S&P 500, ended the week on a negative note. The US Treasury yields fell to 4.40% on Friday, while the 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.42% on Monday. The gold price rose 0.8% to $3,317 per ounce on Monday. The dollar index was flat at 99.3, while the Brent crude oil price rose 2.4% to $64.1 per barrel. In Europe, the focus is on the manufacturing PMI data to be released today, which is expected to provide insights into the region's economic activity. The region's economy is facing an inflation-resession dilemma, and the PMI data is expected to provide more information on the region's economic trajectory. The region's stock markets, including the DAX 40, FTSE MIB 30, and FTSE 100, ended the week on a mixed note. The Asian markets started the week on a negative note due to concerns about a possible escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. The region's stock markets, including the Nikkei 225, Kospi, and Hang Seng, ended the week on a negative note. The BIST 100 index in Turkey ended the week on a negative note, falling 1.65% to 9,019.57. The BIST 30 index futures contract on the V\u0130OP ended the week on a negative note, falling 0.2% to 10,210.00. The SPK announced that the restrictions on short selling in the Borsa \u0130stanbul A\u015e pay market, the easing of the requirements for public companies to buy back their shares, and the relaxation of the capital requirements for credit institutions will be extended until July 4. The dollar/TL exchange rate rose 0.3% to 39.2100 on Friday and was trading at 39.2590 on Monday. Analysts expect today's manufacturing PMI data to be released in Turkey and the US, as well as Powell's speech, to be closely watched by investors. From a technical perspective, the BIST 100 index is expected to find support at 9,000 and 8,900, and resistance at 9,100 and 9,200.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: June 02, 2025 06:28 AM\nSource:[K\u0131br\u0131s Gazetesi](https://kibrisgazetesi.com/kuresel-piyasalar-haftaya-negatif-seyirle-basladi/)\n\n**Indonesia Sees 0.37% Deflation in May 2025, Says BPS**\nIndonesia's economy experienced a 0.37 percent monthly deflation in May 2025, according to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS).

The inflation-adjusted personal spending rose 0.1%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Federal Reserve's preferred price gauge remained tame, with the personal consumption expenditures price index increasing 0.1% from a month earlier. The core inflation gauge rose 2.5% from April 2024, the smallest annual advance in more than four years. Economists are concerned about the impact of tariffs on prices and the labor market, and the constant state of flux in trade policy is fueling further uncertainty. As one economist noted, 'American spending moderated in April as U.S. businesses pulled back significantly on imports after months of pulling forward economic activity to avoid tariff policy.' The trade truce between the US and China has led to a rebound in consumer sentiment, but the uncertainty remains.

'On the other hand, the cyclical components had a more moderate performance, reflecting a lower dynamism in domestic demand than the overall result may suggest,' they added, foreseeing a slowdown in the coming year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:53 PM\nSource:[noticiasagricolas.com.br](https://www.noticiasagricolas.com.br/noticias/politica-economia/401550-ibovespa-fecha-em-queda-com-realizacao-de-lucros-mas-acumula-alta-em-maio.html)\n\n**China's April 2025 Economic Data Shows Continuing Deflationary Trend - Vision Times**\nChina's April 2025 economic data shows a continuing deflationary trend, according to analysts. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) reported a slight decrease in broad (M2) money supply, but an 8% rise compared to April 2024. Meanwhile, narrow (M1) money supply rose 1.5% year-on-year, but fell by 4.35 trillion yuan in April compared to March. Various types of loans decreased, while deposits fell. SinoInsider, a risk consultancy, notes that the data indicates a trend of 'deflation, weak credit demand, and an economy heavily reliant on government debt to mask underlying vulnerabilities.' The analysts observed that M2 money supply growth was not matched by a similar growth in M1 supply, indicating poor liquidity. They also noted that plummeting RMB loans and deposits reflect subdued credit demand and contracting financing activity, underscoring China's anemic domestic demand. 'Rising domestic skepticism, the U.S.'s imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese exports in early April 2025 disrupted the export sector, likely dampening economic sentiment and consumer spending,' the newsletter reads.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 21, 2025 11:22 PM\nSource:[visiontimes.com](https://www.visiontimes.com/2025/05/21/chinas-april-2025-economic-data-shows-continuing-deflationary-trend.html)\n\n**China's Producer Price Index Falls 2.7% Year-Over-Year, Raising Deflation Concerns**\nChina's producer price index (PPI) fell 2.7% year-over-year in April, marking a 31-month consecutive decline. The National Bureau of Statistics of China stated that 'the international trade environment has changed, causing some international raw material prices to drop sharply, resulting in a decrease in domestic related industry prices.' The consumer price index (CPI) also fell 0.1% year-over-year in April, marking a third consecutive month of decline. Analysts warn that the ongoing trade war with the US is exacerbating the situation, with Bloomberg citing 'the pressure of deflation continues to rise, and the possibility of further deterioration is high.' As some companies release export products domestically, competition is increasing, and companies may lower prices, leading to a decrease in consumer purchasing power and making it difficult for companies to raise product prices, potentially leading to a deeper deflation.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 08:56 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025051153821)\n\n**China's CPI and PPI Show Negative Growth, Deflationary Pressure Intensifies**\nThe National Bureau of Statistics of China released data showing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-over-year in April, marking the third consecutive month of negative growth. The Producer Price Index (PPI) decreased by 2.7% year-over-year, the largest decline in nearly six months, and has been in a continuous negative growth trend for 30 months. Analysts point out that as exports weaken, China may face increased pressure from deflation. According to Dong Lijuan, chief statistician of the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the CPI's continuous decline is mainly due to the international oil price decline. The data shows that energy prices decreased by 4.8% year-over-year in April, with gasoline prices decreasing by 10.4%, accounting for a 0.38 percentage point decrease in CPI, which is the main reason for the decline. However, if food and energy prices are excluded, the core CPI for April increased by 0.5% year-over-year, the same as the previous month. Dong emphasized that although international input factors have a certain downward impact on some industries' prices, China's economy has a solid foundation and strong resilience, and various macroeconomic policies are working together, with some areas showing positive price changes. It is worth noting that the PPI in April decreased by 2.7% year-over-year, the largest decline in nearly six months. According to a report by Huaxin Securities, the PPI led the CPI in responding to changes in external demand in April, with a larger year-over-year decline. Reuters quoted Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist of a major bank, as saying, 'China still faces sustained deflationary pressure. With exports possibly weakening, the pressure may increase in the next few months.' He added, 'Even if the US-China trade talks can make progress and reduce tariffs, tariffs are unlikely to return to their pre-April levels. The authorities need to take more active fiscal policies to expand domestic demand and solve the deflation problem.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 10, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5603/8731451)\n\n**China's Consumer Prices Fall for Third Straight Month in April**\nChina's consumer prices fell for the third consecutive month in April, while producer deflation deepened, as policymakers deal with the economic impact of a trade war with the US.

The result also matched a Reuters poll's forecast of a 0.1% decline. In April compared to March, the CPI rose 0.1%, reversing a 0.4% decline in March and beating economists' expectations of no change in prices.

The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) also reported that the producer price index (PPI), which measures the cost of goods at the factory gate, fell by 2.7% year-on-year in April, a sharper decline than the 2.5% drop in March. The PPI has been declining in recent months, which is a sign of reduced corporate profits. According to Julian Evans-Pritchard and Zichun Huang of Capital Economics, the decline in oil prices has contributed to the trend of deflation. They also suspect that China's industrial overcapacity continues to put downward pressure on factory gate prices. China's exports surged 8.1% in April, exceeding expectations by four times, as trade shifted towards Southeast Asia, offsetting the impact of US tariffs. However, exports to the US fell 17.6% compared to March, while those to Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam increased by over 10%.

The CPI has remained close to zero for 26 months, and the core inflation rate, excluding food and energy prices, rose 0.5%. Food prices increased 0.2%, while non-food prices remained unchanged. The prices of consumer goods fell 0.3%, while service prices rose 0.3%. The CPI has been below 1% since March 2023. The NBS said that the prolonged deflation trend has raised concerns about the economy. The Chinese government has lowered its inflation target to 2% this year from 3% due to the ongoing deflation trend. The PPI has been declining for 31 months, with a 2.7% drop in April. The PPI has been declining since October 2022, with a 3% drop in 2023 and a 2.2% drop in 2024. The decline in domestic demand, local government debt risks, and the decline in the real estate sector, as well as the uncertainty created by the US's tariff policies, continue to negatively impact China's economy. China is one of the few countries that has experienced a decline in inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic, unlike many developed economies that have seen high inflation.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 10, 2025 11:59 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/ekonomi/cin-de-tuketici-ve-uretici-fiyatlari-dususte-deflasyon-endiseleri-artiyor-18610725-haberi/)\n\n**China's Deflation Deepens Amid US Trade War and Faltering Domestic Demand**\nChina has experienced its third consecutive month of consumer price deflation in April, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) falling 0.1% year-on-year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

The prolonged trade war with the US has had a significant impact on China's economy. The country's housing market has been sluggish, household debt is high, and employment is unstable, all of which have suppressed investment and consumption, and deflationary pressure has persisted. 'China still faces sustained deflationary pressure,' said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, in an interview with Reuters. 'Given the potential weakening of exports, the pressure may intensify in the coming months.' Zhang added that even if the US-China trade talks make progress and tariffs are reduced, they are unlikely to return to their pre-April levels. 'Beijing needs to adopt more active fiscal policies to stimulate domestic demand and address deflation,' he said. The National Bureau of Statistics of China also reported that the CPI fell 0.1% year-on-year in April, consistent with the 0.1% decline in March and the forecast of Reuters' survey. The core inflation rate, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.5% year-on-year in April, consistent with the 0.5% rise in March. China's economy has continued to be affected by deflation in the first three months of the year, reflecting a supply-demand imbalance. The GDP deflator, a broad measure of the overall price level, has fallen for eight consecutive quarters, the longest decline since the data began in 1993. 'The stimulus measures aimed at boosting consumption seem to have had limited effect since the fourth quarter of last year,' said David Qu, an economist at Bloomberg Economics, in a report on Saturday. The US tariffs have had a significant impact on China's employment and corporate revenue, and may weaken Chinese consumers' purchasing power and willingness to consume, leading manufacturers and service providers to lower prices. As the trade war with the US has put pressure on China's exports, Chinese retail giants such as JD.com and Alibaba's Hema Fresh have taken measures to help exporters shift to the domestic market, further lowering domestic prices. Global investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, have lowered their GDP growth forecasts for China this year to below the official target of around 5%, with Goldman Sachs forecasting 4% growth and UBS predicting 3.4%, the most pessimistic forecast among major investment banks.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 10, 2025 05:43 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/5/10/n14504128.htm)\n\n**China's Consumer Price Index Falls 0.1% Year-Over-Year in April**\nChina's consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% year-over-year in April, marking the third consecutive month of decline. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the 4-month CPI was 0.1% lower than the same period last year. The country's CPI has been declining since January, when it rose 0.5% year-over-year, but has since fallen to -0.7% in February and -0.1% in March. However, the 4-month CPI rose 0.1% from the previous month, surpassing the Reuters forecast of no change. The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.7% year-over-year in April, marking the 31st consecutive month of decline. Dong Ruijun, the head of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that the decline in CPI was mainly due to the decline in international oil prices, and that the PPI decline was due to changes in the international trade environment, which led to a sharp decline in international raw material prices and a subsequent decline in domestic related industry prices. He added that while international import factors have affected some industry prices, the core CPI excluding food and energy prices rose 0.5% from the previous month, and the growth rate has remained stable. China is facing deflationary pressure, unlike other major countries, which are concerned about inflation. The Chinese government has introduced various policies to stimulate domestic consumption, but is facing difficulties due to the trade war with the US. Reuters noted that the prolonged housing market downturn, high household debt, and employment uncertainty are hindering investment and consumption, and that the increased trade barriers are also increasing external risks. Additionally, the trade war has led to a measure to help domestic companies sell export products, which could further exacerbate deflationary pressure in a situation where business and consumer confidence is already suppressed.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: May 10, 2025 05:29 AM\nSource:[KBS](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/pc/view/view.do?ncd=8250105)\n\n**China Experiences Third Consecutive Month of Deflation in April**\nChina recorded deflation for the third consecutive month in April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (GNE).

However, due to the rise in food and transportation service prices, the monthly change turned positive at 0.1%. The Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 2.7% year-on-year, with a monthly decline of 0.5%. According to National Bureau of Statistics' chief statistician Dong Li Juan, the CPI's year-on-year decline was mainly due to the decline in international oil prices, which led to a 10.4% drop in gasoline prices, accounting for approximately 0.38 percentage points of the CPI's year-on-year decline. The main reasons for the PPI's decline include international input factors affecting domestic industry prices and seasonal declines in domestic energy prices. Analysts from Bloomberg suggest that the recent trade tensions between the US and China, including the 145% tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese export products, may have prompted some companies to shift their production back to China, exacerbating the already intense competition and leading to further price cuts, resulting in the CPI's year-on-year decline.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 10, 2025 02:59 AM\nSource:[std.stheadline.com](https://std.stheadline.com/realtime/article/2068220/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E8%B2%A1%E7%B6%93-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E4%B8%8A%E6%9C%88CPI%E8%B7%8C0-1-%E9%80%A3%E7%BA%8C3%E5%80%8B%E6%9C%88%E9%80%9A%E7%B8%AE)\n\n**China's Consumer Price Index Falls 0.1% in April, Marking Third Consecutive Month of Decline**\nChina's consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in April compared to the same month last year, marking the third consecutive month of decline.

The 4% PPI (Producer Price Index) decrease, which is the 31st consecutive month of decline, has raised concerns about deflationary pressure. Experts believe that China's deflationary pressure will continue due to the ongoing trade war with the US and the decrease in jobs and income, leading to consumers tightening their wallets. As a result, companies will be forced to lower prices. David Cui, an economist at Bloomberg Economics, stated, 'It seems that the policy efforts to boost consumption since the fourth quarter of last year have not been effective.' He added, 'If the US-China trade talks do not lead to a breakthrough, the government will need to quickly expand fiscal policy.'

The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.2% year-over-year, marking the 29th consecutive month in negative territory. According to Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Silverlake Asset Management, 'China's economy still faces deflationary pressure, and domestic demand remains weak.' China's National Bureau of Statistics chief statistician Dong Li Juan explained that the CPI fell due to the impact of the Chinese New Year holiday, which led to a higher base effect. After adjusting for seasonal factors, the CPI actually rose 0.1% year-over-year. The Wall Street Journal reported that despite this, Chinese policymakers have set a lower inflation target for this year, around 2%, the lowest in over 20 years, indicating that they have finally acknowledged the impact of deflationary pressure on the economy. According to the report, Chinese official Chen Changsheng emphasized that sustained low prices would suppress corporate investment and increase debt burdens, echoing the concerns of some economists who fear that China may fall into an economic trap similar to Japan's in the 1990s. China has raised its fiscal deficit ratio to 4% this year, the highest in over 30 years, indicating that the country's price outlook may be even gloomier. The report also noted that China's budget deficit ratio implies a nominal growth target of 4.9% and a GDP deflator of -0.1%, marking the third consecutive year of negative growth, and putting China on the path of the longest deflationary trend since the 1960s.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 09, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u5831\u96fb\u5b50\u5831](https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/4974636)\n\n",

Across perspectives\u2014central banking, economic time-series analysis, macroeconomics, political economy, China studies, and consensus forecasting\u2014experts highlight persistent deflationary pressures due to weak domestic demand (particularly from the slumping property sector), negative producer prices, ineffective or muted policy stimulus, and ongoing external trade challenges (notably US tariffs suppressing exports and internal pricing power). Historical base rates and previous bouts of Chinese deflation further suggest that once a deflationary streak reaches three months, it typically persists for several more. Marginal counter-arguments include the possibility of a food or energy price rebound, statistical base effects, or a surprise government stimulus\u2014however, none cite evidence of these occurring in May. News and available data for May 2025 continue to show no substantive change in underlying drivers. All experts agree the risk of a positive CPI print is nonzero but low, and probability assessments consistently point to another month of shallow year-over-year deflation."
